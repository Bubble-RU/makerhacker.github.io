<p>Author: Marzieh Bazrafshan ; Daniel Gildea</p><p>Abstract: We experiment with adding semantic role information to a string-to-tree machine translation system based on the rule extraction procedure of Galley et al. (2004). We compare methods based on augmenting the set of nonterminals by adding semantic role labels, and altering the rule extraction process to produce a separate set of rules for each predicate that encompass its entire predicate-argument structure. Our results demonstrate that the second approach is effective in increasing the quality of translations.</p><p>3 0.17702727 <a title="320-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Travatar%3A_A_Forest-to-String_Machine_Translation_Engine_based_on_Tree_Transducers.html">361 acl-2013-Travatar: A Forest-to-String Machine Translation Engine based on Tree Transducers</a></p>
<p>Author: Graham Neubig</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we describe Travatar, a forest-to-string machine translation (MT) engine based on tree transducers. It provides an open-source C++ implementation for the entire forest-to-string MT pipeline, including rule extraction, tuning, decoding, and evaluation. There are a number of options for model training, and tuning includes advanced options such as hypergraph MERT, and training of sparse features through online learning. The training pipeline is modeled after that of the popular Moses decoder, so users familiar with Moses should be able to get started quickly. We perform a validation experiment of the decoder on EnglishJapanese machine translation, and find that it is possible to achieve greater accuracy than translation using phrase-based and hierarchical-phrase-based translation. As auxiliary results, we also compare different syntactic parsers and alignment techniques that we tested in the process of developing the decoder.

<p>Author: Wenduan Xu ; Yue Zhang ; Philip Williams ; Philipp Koehn</p><p>Abstract: We present a context-sensitive chart pruning method for CKY-style MT decoding. Source phrases that are unlikely to have aligned target constituents are identified using sequence labellers learned from the parallel corpus, and speed-up is obtained by pruning corresponding chart cells. The proposed method is easy to implement, orthogonal to cube pruning and additive to its pruning power. On a full-scale Englishto-German experiment with a string-totree model, we obtain a speed-up of more than 60% over a strong baseline, with no loss in BLEU.</p><p>5 0.15074229 <a title="320-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-A_Shift-Reduce_Parsing_Algorithm_for_Phrase-based_String-to-Dependency_Translation.html">19 acl-2013-A Shift-Reduce Parsing Algorithm for Phrase-based String-to-Dependency Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a shift-reduce parsing algorithm for phrase-based string-todependency translation. As the algorithm generates dependency trees for partial translations left-to-right in decoding, it allows for efficient integration of both n-gram and dependency language models. To resolve conflicts in shift-reduce parsing, we propose a maximum entropy model trained on the derivation graph of training data. As our approach combines the merits of phrase-based and string-todependency models, it achieves significant improvements over the two baselines on the NIST Chinese-English datasets.</p><p>6 0.14130192 <a title="320-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Integrating_Phrase-based_Reordering_Features_into_a_Chart-based_Decoder_for_Machine_Translation.html">200 acl-2013-Integrating Phrase-based Reordering Features into a Chart-based Decoder for Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: ThuyLinh Nguyen ; Stephan Vogel</p><p>Abstract: Hiero translation models have two limitations compared to phrase-based models: 1) Limited hypothesis space; 2) No lexicalized reordering model. We propose an extension of Hiero called PhrasalHiero to address Hiero’s second problem. Phrasal-Hiero still has the same hypothesis space as the original Hiero but incorporates a phrase-based distance cost feature and lexicalized reodering features into the chart decoder. The work consists of two parts: 1) for each Hiero translation derivation, find its corresponding dis- continuous phrase-based path. 2) Extend the chart decoder to incorporate features from the phrase-based path. We achieve significant improvement over both Hiero and phrase-based baselines for ArabicEnglish, Chinese-English and GermanEnglish translation.</p><p>4 0.80464023 <a title="320-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-General_binarization_for_parsing_and_translation.html">165 acl-2013-General binarization for parsing and translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Sean Szumlanski ; Fernando Gomez ; Valerie K. Sims</p><p>Abstract: We have elicited human quantitative judgments of semantic relatedness for 122 pairs of nouns and compiled them into a new set of relatedness norms that we call Rel-122. Judgments from individual subjects in our study exhibit high average correlation to the resulting relatedness means (r = 0.77, σ = 0.09, N = 73), although not as high as Resnik’s (1995) upper bound for expected average human correlation to similarity means (r = 0.90). This suggests that human perceptions of relatedness are less strictly constrained than perceptions of similarity and establishes a clearer expectation for what constitutes human-like performance by a computational measure of semantic relatedness. We compare the results of several WordNet-based similarity and relatedness measures to our Rel-122 norms and demonstrate the limitations of WordNet for discovering general indications of semantic relatedness. We also offer a critique of the field’s reliance upon similarity norms to evaluate relatedness measures.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.72965789 <a title="320-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Shallow_Local_Multi-Bottom-up_Tree_Transducers_in_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">320 acl-2013-Shallow Local Multi-Bottom-up Tree Transducers in Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Britta Zeller ; Jan Snajder ; Sebastian Pado</p><p>Abstract: Derivational models are still an underresearched area in computational morphology. Even for German, a rather resourcerich language, there is a lack of largecoverage derivational knowledge. This paper describes a rule-based framework for inducing derivational families (i.e., clusters of lemmas in derivational relationships) and its application to create a highcoverage German resource, DERIVBASE, mapping over 280k lemmas into more than 17k non-singleton clusters. We focus on the rule component and a qualitative and quantitative evaluation. Our approach achieves up to 93% precision and 71% recall. We attribute the high precision to the fact that our rules are based on information from grammar books.</p><p>4 0.69018692 <a title="320-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Multimodal_DBN_for_Predicting_High-Quality_Answers_in_cQA_portals.html">254 acl-2013-Multimodal DBN for Predicting High-Quality Answers in cQA portals</a></p>
<p>Author: Haifeng Hu ; Bingquan Liu ; Baoxun Wang ; Ming Liu ; Xiaolong Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem for predicting cQA answer quality as a classification task. We propose a multimodal deep belief nets based approach that operates in two stages: First, the joint representation is learned by taking both textual and non-textual features into a deep learning network. Then, the joint representation learned by the network is used as input features for a linear classifier. Extensive experimental results conducted on two cQA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p><p>5 0.68048418 <a title="320-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Re-embedding_words.html">294 acl-2013-Re-embedding words</a></p>
<p>Author: Igor Labutov ; Hod Lipson</p><p>Abstract: We present a fast method for re-purposing existing semantic word vectors to improve performance in a supervised task. Recently, with an increase in computing resources, it became possible to learn rich word embeddings from massive amounts of unlabeled data. However, some methods take days or weeks to learn good embeddings, and some are notoriously difficult to train. We propose a method that takes as input an existing embedding, some labeled data, and produces an embedding in the same space, but with a better predictive performance in the supervised task. We show improvement on the task of sentiment classification with re- spect to several baselines, and observe that the approach is most useful when the training set is sufficiently small.</p><p>6 0.64311093 <a title="320-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Social_Text_Normalization_using_Contextual_Graph_Random_Walks.html">326 acl-2013-Social Text Normalization using Contextual Graph Random Walks</a></p>

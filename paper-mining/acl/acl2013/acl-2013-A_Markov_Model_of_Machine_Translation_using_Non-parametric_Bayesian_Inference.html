<p>Author: Jiajun Zhang ; Chengqing Zong</p><p>Abstract: Currently, almost all of the statistical machine translation (SMT) models are trained with the parallel corpora in some specific domains. However, when it comes to a language pair or a different domain without any bilingual resources, the traditional SMT loses its power. Recently, some research works study the unsupervised SMT for inducing a simple word-based translation model from the monolingual corpora. It successfully bypasses the constraint of bitext for SMT and obtains a relatively promising result. In this paper, we take a step forward and propose a simple but effective method to induce a phrase-based model from the monolingual corpora given an automatically-induced translation lexicon or a manually-edited translation dictionary. We apply our method for the domain adaptation task and the extensive experiments show that our proposed method can substantially improve the translation quality. 1</p><p>3 0.21063541 <a title="10-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Exact_Maximum_Inference_for_the_Fertility_Hidden_Markov_Model.html">143 acl-2013-Exact Maximum Inference for the Fertility Hidden Markov Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Chris Quirk</p><p>Abstract: The notion of fertility in word alignment (the number of words emitted by a single state) is useful but difficult to model. Initial attempts at modeling fertility used heuristic search methods. Recent approaches instead use more principled approximate inference techniques such as Gibbs sampling for parameter estimation. Yet in practice we also need the single best alignment, which is difficult to find using Gibbs. Building on recent advances in dual decomposition, this paper introduces an exact algorithm for finding the single best alignment with a fertility HMM. Finding the best alignment appears important, as this model leads to a substantial improvement in alignment quality.</p><p>4 0.20608874 <a title="10-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Name-aware_Machine_Translation.html">255 acl-2013-Name-aware Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Haibo Li ; Jing Zheng ; Heng Ji ; Qi Li ; Wen Wang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a Name-aware Machine Translation (MT) approach which can tightly integrate name processing into MT model, by jointly annotating parallel corpora, extracting name-aware translation grammar and rules, adding name phrase table and name translation driven decoding. Additionally, we also propose a new MT metric to appropriately evaluate the translation quality of informative words, by assigning different weights to different words according to their importance values in a document. Experiments on Chinese-English translation demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on enhancing the quality of overall translation, name translation and word alignment over a high-quality MT baseline1 .</p><p>5 0.20421825 <a title="10-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-An_Infinite_Hierarchical_Bayesian_Model_of_Phrasal_Translation.html">46 acl-2013-An Infinite Hierarchical Bayesian Model of Phrasal Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Trevor Cohn ; Gholamreza Haffari</p><p>Abstract: Modern phrase-based machine translation systems make extensive use of wordbased translation models for inducing alignments from parallel corpora. This is problematic, as the systems are incapable of accurately modelling many translation phenomena that do not decompose into word-for-word translation. This paper presents a novel method for inducing phrase-based translation units directly from parallel data, which we frame as learning an inverse transduction grammar (ITG) using a recursive Bayesian prior. Overall this leads to a model which learns translations of entire sentences, while also learning their decomposition into smaller units (phrase-pairs) recursively, terminating at word translations. Our experiments on Arabic, Urdu and Farsi to English demonstrate improvements over competitive baseline systems.</p><p>6 0.19427963 <a title="10-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Scalable_Decipherment_for_Machine_Translation_via_Hash_Sampling.html">307 acl-2013-Scalable Decipherment for Machine Translation via Hash Sampling</a></p>

<p>Author: Sujith Ravi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new Bayesian inference method to train statistical machine translation systems using only nonparallel corpora. Following a probabilistic decipherment approach, we first introduce a new framework for decipherment training that is flexible enough to incorporate any number/type of features (besides simple bag-of-words) as side-information used for estimating translation models. In order to perform fast, efficient Bayesian inference in this framework, we then derive a hash sampling strategy that is inspired by the work of Ahmed et al. (2012). The new translation hash sampler enables us to scale elegantly to complex models (for the first time) and large vocab- ulary/corpora sizes. We show empirical results on the OPUS data—our method yields the best BLEU scores compared to existing approaches, while achieving significant computational speedups (several orders faster). We also report for the first time—BLEU score results for a largescale MT task using only non-parallel data (EMEA corpus).</p><p>3 0.83069211 <a title="10-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-TransDoop%3A_A_Map-Reduce_based_Crowdsourced_Translation_for_Complex_Domain.html">355 acl-2013-TransDoop: A Map-Reduce based Crowdsourced Translation for Complex Domain</a></p>
<p>Author: Anoop Kunchukuttan ; Rajen Chatterjee ; Shourya Roy ; Abhijit Mishra ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: Large amount of parallel corpora is required for building Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems. We describe the TransDoop system for gathering translations to create parallel corpora from online crowd workforce who have familiarity with multiple languages but are not expert translators. Our system uses a Map-Reduce-like approach to translation crowdsourcing where sentence translation is decomposed into the following smaller tasks: (a) translation ofconstituent phrases of the sentence; (b) validation of quality of the phrase translations; and (c) composition of complete sentence translations from phrase translations. Trans- Doop incorporates quality control mechanisms and easy-to-use worker user interfaces designed to address issues with translation crowdsourcing. We have evaluated the crowd’s output using the METEOR metric. For a complex domain like judicial proceedings, the higher scores obtained by the map-reduce based approach compared to complete sentence translation establishes the efficacy of our work.</p><p>4 0.82837361 <a title="10-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-SORT%3A_An_Interactive_Source-Rewriting_Tool_for_Improved_Translation.html">305 acl-2013-SORT: An Interactive Source-Rewriting Tool for Improved Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Shachar Mirkin ; Sriram Venkatapathy ; Marc Dymetman ; Ioan Calapodescu</p><p>Abstract: The quality of automatic translation is affected by many factors. One is the divergence between the specific source and target languages. Another lies in the source text itself, as some texts are more complex than others. One way to handle such texts is to modify them prior to translation. Yet, an important factor that is often overlooked is the source translatability with respect to the specific translation system and the specific model that are being used. In this paper we present an interactive system where source modifications are induced by confidence estimates that are derived from the translation model in use. Modifications are automatically generated and proposed for the user’s ap- proval. Such a system can reduce postediting effort, replacing it by cost-effective pre-editing that can be done by monolinguals.</p><p>5 0.8180449 <a title="10-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Automatically_Predicting_Sentence_Translation_Difficulty.html">64 acl-2013-Automatically Predicting Sentence Translation Difficulty</a></p>
<p>Author: Abhijit Mishra ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya ; Michael Carl</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce Translation Difficulty Index (TDI), a measure of difficulty in text translation. We first define and quantify translation difficulty in terms of TDI. We realize that any measure of TDI based on direct input by translators is fraught with subjectivity and adhocism. We, rather, rely on cognitive evidences from eye tracking. TDI is measured as the sum of fixation (gaze) and saccade (rapid eye movement) times of the eye. We then establish that TDI is correlated with three properties of the input sentence, viz. length (L), degree of polysemy (DP) and structural complexity (SC). We train a Support Vector Regression (SVR) system to predict TDIs for new sentences using these features as input. The prediction done by our framework is well correlated with the empirical gold standard data, which is a repository of < L, DP, SC > and TDI pairs for a set of sentences. The primary use of our work is a way of “binning” sentences (to be translated) in “easy”, “medium” and “hard” categories as per their predicted TDI. This can decide pricing of any translation task, especially useful in a scenario where parallel corpora for Machine Translation are built through translation crowdsourcing/outsourcing. This can also provide a way of monitoring progress of second language learners.</p><p>6 0.8157317 <a title="10-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Name-aware_Machine_Translation.html">255 acl-2013-Name-aware Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Ahmed El Kholy ; Nizar Habash ; Gregor Leusch ; Evgeny Matusov ; Hassan Sawaf</p><p>Abstract: An important challenge to statistical machine translation (SMT) is the lack of parallel data for many language pairs. One common solution is to pivot through a third language for which there exist parallel corpora with the source and target languages. Although pivoting is a robust technique, it introduces some low quality translations. In this paper, we present two language-independent features to improve the quality of phrase-pivot based SMT. The features, source connectivity strength and target connectivity strength reflect the quality of projected alignments between the source and target phrases in the pivot phrase table. We show positive results (0.6 BLEU points) on Persian-Arabic SMT as a case study.</p><p>4 0.87772185 <a title="10-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-A_Lightweight_and_High_Performance_Monolingual_Word_Aligner.html">9 acl-2013-A Lightweight and High Performance Monolingual Word Aligner</a></p>

We describe a discriminatively trained monolingual word aligner that uses a Conditional Random Field to globally decode the best alignment with features drawn from source and target sentences. Using just part-of-speech tags and WordNet as external resources, our aligner gives state-of-the-art result, while being an order-of-magnitude faster than the previous best performing system.</p><p>5 0.87760758 <a title="10-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Translating_Dialectal_Arabic_to_English.html">359 acl-2013-Translating Dialectal Arabic to English</a></p>
<p>Author: Hassan Sajjad ; Kareem Darwish ; Yonatan Belinkov</p><p>Abstract: We present a dialectal Egyptian Arabic to English statistical machine translation system that leverages dialectal to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) adaptation. In contrast to previous work, we first narrow down the gap between Egyptian and MSA by applying an automatic characterlevel transformational model that changes Egyptian to EG0, which looks similar to MSA. The transformations include morphological, phonological and spelling changes. The transformation reduces the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words from 5.2% to 2.6% and gives a gain of 1.87 BLEU points. Further, adapting large MSA/English parallel data increases the lexical coverage, reduces OOVs to 0.7% and leads to an absolute BLEU improvement of 2.73 points.</p><p>6 0.87682921 <a title="10-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-LABR%3A_A_Large_Scale_Arabic_Book_Reviews_Dataset.html">211 acl-2013-LABR: A Large Scale Arabic Book Reviews Dataset</a></p>

<p>Author: Svitlana Volkova ; Pallavi Choudhury ; Chris Quirk ; Bill Dolan ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: Procedural dialog systems can help users achieve a wide range of goals. However, such systems are challenging to build, currently requiring manual engineering of substantial domain-specific task knowledge and dialog management strategies. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn procedural dialog systems given only light supervision, of the type that can be provided by non-experts. We consider domains where the required task knowledge exists in textual form (e.g., instructional web pages) and where system builders have access to statements of user intent (e.g., search query logs or dialog interactions). To learn from such textual resources, we describe a novel approach that first automatically extracts task knowledge from instructions, then learns a dialog manager over this task knowledge to provide assistance. Evaluation in a Microsoft Office domain shows that the individual components are highly accurate and can be integrated into a dialog system that provides effective help to users.</p><p>3 0.29052278 <a title="90-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Generating_Recommendation_Dialogs_by_Extracting_Information_from_User_Reviews.html">168 acl-2013-Generating Recommendation Dialogs by Extracting Information from User Reviews</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhengyan He ; Shujie Liu ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou ; Longkai Zhang ; Houfeng Wang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel entity disambiguation model, based on Deep Neural Network (DNN). Instead of utilizing simple similarity measures and their disjoint combinations, our method directly optimizes document and entity representations for a given similarity measure. Stacked Denoising Auto-encoders are first employed to learn an initial document representation in an unsupervised pre-training stage. A supervised fine-tuning stage follows to optimize the representation towards the similarity measure. Experiment results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets without any manually designed features, even beating complex collective approaches.</p><p>2 0.9985742 <a title="90-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Mining_Informal_Language_from_Chinese_Microtext%3A_Joint_Word_Recognition_and_Segmentation.html">243 acl-2013-Mining Informal Language from Chinese Microtext: Joint Word Recognition and Segmentation</a></p>

<p>Author: Kevin Knight</p><p>Abstract: The first natural language processing systems had a straightforward goal: decipher coded messages sent by the enemy. This tutorial explores connections between early decipherment research and today’s NLP work. We cover classic military and diplomatic ciphers, automatic decipherment algorithms, unsolved ciphers, language translation as decipherment, and analyzing ancient writing as decipherment. 1 Tutorial Overview The first natural language processing systems had a straightforward goal: decipher coded messages sent by the enemy. Sixty years later, we have many more applications, including web search, question answering, summarization, speech recognition, and language translation. This tutorial explores connections between early decipherment research and today’s NLP work. We find that many ideas from the earlier era have become core to the field, while others still remain to be picked up and developed. We first cover classic military and diplomatic cipher types, including complex substitution ciphers implemented in the first electro-mechanical encryption machines. We look at mathematical tools (language recognition, frequency counting, smoothing) developed to decrypt such ciphers on proto-computers. We show algorithms and extensive empirical results for solving different types of ciphers, and we show the role of algorithms in recent decipherments of historical documents. We then look at how foreign language can be viewed as a code for English, a concept developed by Alan Turing and Warren Weaver. We describe recently published work on building automatic translation systems from non-parallel data. We also demonstrate how some of the same algorithmic tools can be applied to natural language tasks like part-of-speech tagging and word alignment. Turning back to historical ciphers, we explore a number of unsolved ciphers, giving results of initial computer experiments on several of them. Finally, we look briefly at writing as a way to encipher phoneme sequences, covering ancient scripts and modern applications. 2 Outline 1.

<p>Author: Young-Bum Kim ; Benjamin Snyder</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a solution to one aspect of the decipherment task: the prediction of consonants and vowels for an unknown language and alphabet. Adopting a classical Bayesian perspective, we performs posterior inference over hundreds of languages, leveraging knowledge of known languages and alphabets to uncover general linguistic patterns of typologically coherent language clusters. We achieve average accuracy in the unsupervised consonant/vowel prediction task of 99% across 503 languages. We further show that our methodology can be used to predict more fine-grained phonetic distinctions. On a three-way classification task between vowels, nasals, and nonnasal consonants, our model yields unsu- pervised accuracy of 89% across the same set of languages.</p><p>5 0.99784803 <a title="90-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-A_Two_Level_Model_for_Context_Sensitive_Inference_Rules.html">27 acl-2013-A Two Level Model for Context Sensitive Inference Rules</a></p>
<p>Author: Oren Melamud ; Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan ; Jacob Goldberger ; Idan Szpektor</p><p>Abstract: Automatic acquisition of inference rules for predicates has been commonly addressed by computing distributional similarity between vectors of argument words, operating at the word space level. A recent line of work, which addresses context sensitivity of rules, represented contexts in a latent topic space and computed similarity over topic vectors. We propose a novel two-level model, which computes similarities between word-level vectors that are biased by topic-level context representations. Evaluations on a naturallydistributed dataset show that our model significantly outperforms prior word-level and topic-level models. We also release a first context-sensitive inference rule set.</p><p>6 0.99709672 <a title="90-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Minimum_Bayes_Risk_based_Answer_Re-ranking_for_Question_Answering.html">241 acl-2013-Minimum Bayes Risk based Answer Re-ranking for Question Answering</a></p>

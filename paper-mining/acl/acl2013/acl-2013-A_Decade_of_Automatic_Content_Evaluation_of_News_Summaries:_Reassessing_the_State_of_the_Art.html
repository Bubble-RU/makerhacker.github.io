This motivates the development of a more accurate automated method to compute pyramid scores. Of three methods tested here, the one that performs best relies on latent semantics.</p><p>3 0.14636515 <a title="5-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-A_Sentence_Compression_Based_Framework_to_Query-Focused_Multi-Document_Summarization.html">18 acl-2013-A Sentence Compression Based Framework to Query-Focused Multi-Document Summarization</a></p>
<p>Author: Lu Wang ; Hema Raghavan ; Vittorio Castelli ; Radu Florian ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of using sentence compression techniques to facilitate queryfocused multi-document summarization. We present a sentence-compression-based framework for the task, and design a series of learning-based compression models built on parse trees. An innovative beam search decoder is proposed to efficiently find highly probable compressions. Under this framework, we show how to integrate various indicative metrics such as linguistic motivation and query relevance into the compression process by deriving a novel formulation of a compression scoring function. Our best model achieves statistically significant improvement over the state-of-the-art systems on several metrics (e.g. 8.0% and 5.4% improvements in ROUGE-2 respectively) for the DUC 2006 and 2007 summarization task. ,</p><p>4 0.13571352 <a title="5-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Using_Supervised_Bigram-based_ILP_for_Extractive_Summarization.html">377 acl-2013-Using Supervised Bigram-based ILP for Extractive Summarization</a></p>
<p>Author: Chen Li ; Xian Qian ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a bigram based supervised method for extractive document summarization in the integer linear programming (ILP) framework. For each bigram, a regression model is used to estimate its frequency in the reference summary. The regression model uses a variety ofindicative features and is trained discriminatively to minimize the distance between the estimated and the ground truth bigram frequency in the reference summary. During testing, the sentence selection problem is formulated as an ILP problem to maximize the bigram gains. We demonstrate that our system consistently outperforms the previous ILP method on different TAC data sets, and performs competitively compared to the best results in the TAC evaluations. We also conducted various analysis to show the impact of bigram selection, weight estimation, and ILP setup.</p><p>5 0.12772743 <a title="5-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Towards_Robust_Abstractive_Multi-Document_Summarization%3A_A_Caseframe_Analysis_of_Centrality_and_Domain.html">353 acl-2013-Towards Robust Abstractive Multi-Document Summarization: A Caseframe Analysis of Centrality and Domain</a></p>
<p>Author: Jackie Chi Kit Cheung ; Gerald Penn</p><p>Abstract: In automatic summarization, centrality is the notion that a summary should contain the core parts of the source text. Current systems use centrality, along with redundancy avoidance and some sentence compression, to produce mostly extractive summaries. In this paper, we investigate how summarization can advance past this paradigm towards robust abstraction by making greater use of the domain of the source text. We conduct a series of studies comparing human-written model summaries to system summaries at the semantic level of caseframes. We show that model summaries (1) are more abstractive and make use of more sentence aggregation, (2) do not contain as many topical caseframes as system summaries, and (3) cannot be reconstructed solely from the source text, but can be if texts from in-domain documents are added. These results suggest that substantial improvements are unlikely to result from better optimizing centrality-based criteria, but rather more domain knowledge is needed.</p><p>6 0.11821244 <a title="5-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Domain-Independent_Abstract_Generation_for_Focused_Meeting_Summarization.html">129 acl-2013-Domain-Independent Abstract Generation for Focused Meeting Summarization</a></p>

<p>Author: Anirban Dasgupta ; Ravi Kumar ; Sujith Ravi</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new optimization framework for summarization by generalizing the submodular framework of (Lin and Bilmes, 2011). In our framework the summarization desideratum is expressed as a sum of a submodular function and a nonsubmodular function, which we call dispersion; the latter uses inter-sentence dissimilarities in different ways in order to ensure non-redundancy of the summary. We consider three natural dispersion functions and show that a greedy algorithm can obtain an approximately optimal summary in all three cases. We conduct experiments on two corporaâ€”DUC 2004 and user comments on news articlesâ€”and show that the performance of our algorithm outperforms those that rely only on submodularity.</p><p>5 0.71908671 <a title="5-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Using_Supervised_Bigram-based_ILP_for_Extractive_Summarization.html">377 acl-2013-Using Supervised Bigram-based ILP for Extractive Summarization</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhenhua Tian ; Hengheng Xiang ; Ziqi Liu ; Qinghua Zheng</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an unsupervised random walk approach to alleviate data sparsity for selectional preferences. Based on the measure of preferences between predicates and arguments, the model aggregates all the transitions from a given predicate to its nearby predicates, and propagates their argument preferences as the given predicateâ€™s smoothed preferences. Experimental results show that this approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on the pseudo-disambiguation task, and it better correlates with human plausibility judgements.</p><p>4 0.74158835 <a title="5-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Leveraging_Domain-Independent_Information_in_Semantic_Parsing.html">228 acl-2013-Leveraging Domain-Independent Information in Semantic Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Dan Goldwasser ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Semantic parsing is a domain-dependent process by nature, as its output is defined over a set of domain symbols. Motivated by the observation that interpretation can be decomposed into domain-dependent and independent components, we suggest a novel interpretation model, which augments a domain dependent model with abstract information that can be shared by multiple domains. Our experiments show that this type of information is useful and can reduce the annotation effort significantly when moving between domains.</p><p>5 0.70643538 <a title="5-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Visual_Features_for_Linguists%3A_Basic_image_analysis_techniques_for_multimodally-curious_NLPers.html">384 acl-2013-Visual Features for Linguists: Basic image analysis techniques for multimodally-curious NLPers</a></p>

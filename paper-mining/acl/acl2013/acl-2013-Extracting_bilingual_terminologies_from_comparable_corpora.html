<p>Author: Johann-Mattis List ; Steven Moran</p><p>Abstract: Given the increasing interest and development of computational and quantitative methods in historical linguistics, it is important that scholars have a basis for documenting, testing, evaluating, and sharing complex workflows. We present a novel open-source toolkit for quantitative tasks in historical linguistics that offers these features. This toolkit also serves as an interface between existing software packages and frequently used data formats, and it provides implementations of new and existing algorithms within a homogeneous framework. We illustrate the toolkitâ€™s functionality with an exemplary workflow that starts with raw language data and ends with automatically calculated phonetic alignments, cognates and borrowings. We then illustrate evaluation metrics on gold standard datasets that are provided with the toolkit.</p><p>3 0.18307489 <a title="154-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Learning_a_Phrase-based_Translation_Model_from_Monolingual_Data_with_Application_to_Domain_Adaptation.html">223 acl-2013-Learning a Phrase-based Translation Model from Monolingual Data with Application to Domain Adaptation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jason R. Smith ; Herve Saint-Amand ; Magdalena Plamada ; Philipp Koehn ; Chris Callison-Burch ; Adam Lopez</p><p>Abstract: Parallel text is the fuel that drives modern machine translation systems. The Web is a comprehensive source of preexisting parallel text, but crawling the entire web is impossible for all but the largest companies. We bring web-scale parallel text to the masses by mining the Common Crawl, a public Web crawl hosted on Amazonâ€™s Elastic Cloud. Starting from nothing more than a set of common two-letter language codes, our open-source extension of the STRAND algorithm mined 32 terabytes of the crawl in just under a day, at a cost of about $500. Our large-scale experiment uncovers large amounts of parallel text in dozens of language pairs across a variety of domains and genres, some previously unavailable in curated datasets. Even with minimal cleaning and filtering, the resulting data boosts translation performance across the board for five different language pairs in the news domain, and on open domain test sets we see improvements of up to 5 BLEU. We make our code and data available for other researchers seeking to mine this rich new data resource.1</p><p>3 0.77848053 <a title="154-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Mapping_Source_to_Target_Strings_without_Alignment_by_Analogical_Learning%3A_A_Case_Study_with_Transliteration.html">236 acl-2013-Mapping Source to Target Strings without Alignment by Analogical Learning: A Case Study with Transliteration</a></p>
<p>Author: Phillippe Langlais</p><p>Abstract: Analogical learning over strings is a holistic model that has been investigated by a few authors as a means to map forms of a source language to forms of a target language. In this study, we revisit this learning paradigm and apply it to the transliteration task. We show that alone, it performs worse than a statistical phrase-based machine translation engine, but the combination of both approaches outperforms each one taken separately, demonstrating the usefulness of the information captured by a so-called formal analogy.</p><p>4 0.76216328 <a title="154-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Name-aware_Machine_Translation.html">255 acl-2013-Name-aware Machine Translation</a></p>

The system achieves an accuracy of 85.5% on an Arabic online-commentary dataset outperforming a previously proposed approach achieving 80.9% and reflecting a significant gain over a majority baseline of 5 1.9% and two strong baseline systems of 78.5% and 80.4%, respectively.</p><p>3 0.77182424 <a title="154-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Learning_a_Phrase-based_Translation_Model_from_Monolingual_Data_with_Application_to_Domain_Adaptation.html">223 acl-2013-Learning a Phrase-based Translation Model from Monolingual Data with Application to Domain Adaptation</a></p>

<p>Author: Kareem Darwish</p><p>Abstract: Some languages lack large knowledge bases and good discriminative features for Name Entity Recognition (NER) that can generalize to previously unseen named entities. One such language is Arabic, which: a) lacks a capitalization feature; and b) has relatively small knowledge bases, such as Wikipedia. In this work we address both problems by incorporating cross-lingual features and knowledge bases from English using cross-lingual links. We show that such features have a dramatic positive effect on recall. We show the effectiveness of cross-lingual features and resources on a standard dataset as well as on two new test sets that cover both news and microblogs. On the standard dataset, we achieved a 4.1% relative improvement in Fmeasure over the best reported result in the literature. The features led to improvements of 17.1% and 20.5% on the new news and mi- croblogs test sets respectively.</p><p>5 0.73932809 <a title="154-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Translating_Dialectal_Arabic_to_English.html">359 acl-2013-Translating Dialectal Arabic to English</a></p>
<p>Author: Hassan Sajjad ; Kareem Darwish ; Yonatan Belinkov</p><p>Abstract: We present a dialectal Egyptian Arabic to English statistical machine translation system that leverages dialectal to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) adaptation. In contrast to previous work, we first narrow down the gap between Egyptian and MSA by applying an automatic characterlevel transformational model that changes Egyptian to EG0, which looks similar to MSA. The transformations include morphological, phonological and spelling changes. The transformation reduces the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words from 5.2% to 2.6% and gives a gain of 1.87 BLEU points. Further, adapting large MSA/English parallel data increases the lexical coverage, reduces OOVs to 0.7% and leads to an absolute BLEU improvement of 2.73 points.</p><p>6 0.73883569 <a title="154-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Advancements_in_Reordering_Models_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">40 acl-2013-Advancements in Reordering Models for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

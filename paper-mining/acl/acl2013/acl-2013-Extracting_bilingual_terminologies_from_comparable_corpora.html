In our approach we treat bilingual term extraction as a classification problem. For classification we use an SVM binary classifier and training data taken from the EUROVOC thesaurus.

The performance of our classifier reaches the 100% precision level for many language pairs.

</p><p>8 Our method works by first pairing each term extracted from a source language document S with each term extracted from a target language document T aligned with S in the comparable corpus. [sent-30, score-1.384]
</p><p>9 We then treat term alignment as a binary classification task, i. [sent-31, score-0.509]

</p><p>12 This second test simulates the situation of using the term alignment system in a real world scenario. [sent-49, score-0.509]
</p><p>13 For this evaluation we collected English-German comparable corpora from Wikipedia, performed monolingual term tagging and ran our tool over the term tagged corpora to extract bilingual terms. [sent-50, score-1.443]
</p><p>14 3  Related Work  Previous studies have investigated the extraction of bilingual terms from parallel and comparable corpora. [sent-51, score-0.45]
</p><p>15 (2007), Cao and Li (2002) and Ismail and Manandhar (2010) the context of text units is used to identify term mappings. [sent-65, score-0.509]
</p><p>16 Very few approaches have treated term alignment as a classification problem suitable for machine learning (ML) techniques. [sent-69, score-0.509]
</p><p>17 Secondly for a given source language term hN1, N2i, target language candidate terms are proposed by composing uaallg tera cnasnldatiidoantse (given by a bilingual dictionary) of N1 into the target language with all translations of N2. [sent-74, score-1.191]
</p><p>18 By considering all terms proposed by monolingual term extractors we consider terms that are syntactically much richer than nounnoun pairs. [sent-76, score-0.795]
</p><p>19 In addition, the term pairs we align are not constrained by an assumption that their component words must be translations of each other as found in a particular dictionary resource. [sent-77, score-0.853]
</p><p>20 4 Feature extraction To align or map source and target terms we use an SVM binary classifier (Joachims, 2002) with a linear kernel and the trade-off between training error and margin parameter c = 10. [sent-78, score-0.499]
</p><p>21 In addition we also removed 403  every entry from the dictionary where the source word was less than four characters and the target word more than five characters in length and vice versa. [sent-87, score-0.434]
</p><p>22 After performing these filtering steps we use the dictionaries to extract the following language dependent features: •  isFirstWordTranslated is a binary feature indicating owrdheTthraenr stlhaet fdirs its wa boirnda riny tfehea source term is a translation of the first word in the target term. [sent-89, score-1.012]
</p><p>23 isLastWordTranslated is a binary feature indicating owrdhTetrhaenrs tlhatee dla isst wa boirnda riny tfehea source term is a translation of the last word in the target term. [sent-93, score-0.949]
</p><p>24 As with the previous feature in case of compound terms we check whether the source term ends with the translation of the target last word. [sent-94, score-0.972]
</p><p>25 percentageOfTranslatedWords returns the percentage Ooff wTroarndssl aint etdheW source teetrumrn wsh tichhe have their translations in the target term. [sent-95, score-0.427]
</p><p>26 To address compound terms we check for each source word translation whether it appears anywhere within the target term. [sent-96, score-0.498]
</p><p>27 percentageOfNotTranslatedWords returns tpheer percentage ootfT wraonrdslsa toefd Wtheor source term which have no translations in the target term. [sent-97, score-0.936]

</p><p>30 Because of this we also use cognate based methods to perform the mapping between source and target words or vice versa. [sent-112, score-0.576]
</p><p>31 , 2001) to implement LCS, so that its computation is efficient and can be applied to a large number of possible term pairs quickly. [sent-120, score-0.615]
</p><p>32 We normalize relative to the length of the longest term:  LCSR(X,Y ) =mlaexn[l[LenC(XS()X,l,eYn( )Y] )]  •  where LCS is the longest common subsequence between two strings and characters in this subsequence need not be contiguous. [sent-121, score-0.478]
</p><p>33 3  Cognate based features with term matching The cognate methods assume that the source and target language strings being compared are drawn from the same character set and fail to capture the corresponding terms if this is not the case. [sent-132, score-1.193]
</p><p>34 1 We address this problem by mapping a source term to the target language writing system or vice versa. [sent-137, score-0.775]
</p><p>35 After mapping a term from source to target language we apply the cognate metrics described in 4. [sent-143, score-1.085]
</p><p>36 2 to the resulting mapped term and the original term in the other language. [sent-144, score-1.018]
</p><p>37 Since we perform both target to source and source to target mapping, the  number of cognate feature scores on the mapped terms is 10 5 due to source to target mapping and 5 due to target to source mapping. [sent-145, score-1.334]
</p><p>38 The combined features are as follows: •  isFirstWordCovered is a binary feature indicating WwohredthCeorv tehreed df i srst a bwionradr yin f tahteu source term has a translation (i. [sent-148, score-0.704]

</p><p>42 Like the dictionary based features, these five features are direction-dependent and are computed  in both directions source to target and target to source, resulting in 10 combined features. [sent-166, score-0.428]
</p><p>43 2, 10 cognate related features derived from character mappings over terms as described in Section 4. [sent-169, score-0.51]
</p><p>44 1 EUROVOC terms EUROVOC is a term thesaurus covering the activities of the EU and the European Parliament in particular. [sent-175, score-0.613]
</p><p>45 It contains 6797 term entries in 24 different languages including 22 EU languages and Croatian and Serbian (Steinberger et al. [sent-176, score-0.646]
</p><p>46 We pre-processed each Wikipedia article by performing monolingual term tagging using TWSC (Pinnis et al. [sent-195, score-0.553]
</p><p>47 TWSC is a term extraction tool which identifies terms ranging from one to four tokens in length. [sent-197, score-0.658]
</p><p>48 Next, it uses term grammar rules, in the form of sequences of POS tags or non-stop words, to identify candidate terms. [sent-200, score-0.509]
</p><p>49 2  Performance test of the classifier  To test the classifier’s performance we evaluated it  against a list of positive and negative examples of bilingual term pairs using the measures of precision, recall and F-measure. [sent-203, score-0.956]
</p><p>50 4 In the evaluation we used 600 positive term pairs taken randomly from the EUROVOC term list. [sent-205, score-1.182]
</p><p>51 3M negative term pairs by pairing a source term with 200 randomly chosen distinct target terms. [sent-207, score-1.419]
</p><p>52 We select such a large number to simulate the real application scenario where the classifier will be confronted with a huge number of negative cases 4Note that we do not use the Maltese-English language pair, as for this pair we found that 5861 out of 6797 term pairs were identical, i. [sent-208, score-0.794]
</p><p>53 406  Table 1: Wikipedia term pairs processed and judged as positive by the classifier. [sent-213, score-0.673]
</p><p>54 The 600 positive examples contain 200 single term pairs (i. [sent-215, score-0.673]
</p><p>55 single word on both sides), 200 term pairs with a single word on only one side (either source or target) and 200 term pairs with more than one word on each side. [sent-217, score-1.377]
</p><p>56 For training we took the remaining 6200 positive term pairs from EUROVOC and constructed another 6200 term pairs as negative examples, leading to total of 12400 term pairs. [sent-218, score-1.836]
</p><p>57 To construct the 6200 negative examples we used the 6200 terms on the source side and paired each source term with an incorrect target term. [sent-219, score-1.017]
</p><p>58 The same term is translated into istruzione degli adulti in Italian and contains three words. [sent-227, score-0.553]
</p><p>59 For this reason we carry out the data preparation process separately for each language pair in order to obtain the three term pair sets consisting of term pairs with only a single word on each side, term pairs with a single word on just one side and term pairs with multiple words on both sides. [sent-228, score-2.487]
</p><p>60 For each pair of Wikipedia articles we used the terms tagged by TWSC and aligned each source term with every target term. [sent-231, score-0.878]
</p><p>61 This means if both source and target articles contain 100 terms then this leads to 10K term pairs. [sent-232, score-0.831]
</p><p>62 Table 1 shows the number of term pairs processed and the count of pairs classified as positive. [sent-234, score-0.721]
</p><p>63 Table 2 shows five positive term pairs extracted from the EnglishGerman comparable corpora for each of the IT and automotive domains. [sent-235, score-1.05]
</p><p>64 We asked human assessors to categorize each term pair into one of the following categories: 1. [sent-237, score-0.625]
</p><p>65 Inclusion: Not an exact translation/transliteration, but an exact translation/transliteration of one term is entirely contained within the term in the other language, e. [sent-240, score-1.171]
</p><p>66 Unrelated: No word in either term is a translation/transliteration of a word in the other. [sent-246, score-0.509]
</p><p>67 We asked the assessors to place each of the term pair into one of the categories 1to 4. [sent-248, score-0.625]
</p><p>68 each term pair contains at least two words on each side. [sent-260, score-0.556]
</p><p>69 Of these, 187 contained 50% or more translation due to cognate words examples of such cases are capital in–  –  –  crease kapitalo eksportas or Arab organisation Arabu lyga with the cognates capital kapitalo and Arab Arabu respectively. [sent-262, score-0.542]
</p><p>70 We observed that all the missing term pairs were not cognates. [sent-296, score-0.615]
</p><p>71 For these term pairs either the source or target terms were not found in the dictionaries. [sent-299, score-0.937]
</p><p>72 For instance, for the term pair offshoring uudelleensijoittautuminen the GIZA++ dictionary contains the entry offshoring but according to the dictionary it is not translated into uudelleensijoittautuminen, which is the matching term in EUROVOC. [sent-300, score-1.444]
</p><p>73 Only a small proportion of the term pairs arejudged as belonging to category 4 (3–7%) the category containing unrelated term pairs. [sent-308, score-1.293]
</p><p>74 For the automotive domain the proportion of equivalent term pairs varies between 60 and 66%. [sent-309, score-0.86]
</p><p>75 For unrelated term pairs this is below 10% for both assessors. [sent-310, score-0.656]
</p><p>76 Across the four classes the percentage agreement was 83% for the automotive domain term pairs and 86% for the IT domain term pairs. [sent-312, score-1.455]
</p><p>77 We also considered two class agreement where we treated term pairs within categories 2 and 3 as belonging to category 4 (i. [sent-316, score-0.714]
</p><p>78 We analyzed the differences and found that they differ in cases where the German and the English term are both in English. [sent-323, score-0.509]
</p><p>79 Since the GIZA++ dictionaries contain only single word–single word mappings, we examined the 408  newly aligned term pairs that consisted of one word on both source and target sides. [sent-326, score-0.896]
</p><p>80 Taking both  the IT and automotive domains together, our algorithm proposed 5021 term pairs of which 2751 (55%) were word-word term pairs. [sent-327, score-1.371]
</p><p>81 17% of the word-word term pairs or 9% of the overall set of aligned term pairs) were already in either the EN-DE or DE-EN GIZA++ dictionaries. [sent-330, score-1.124]
</p><p>82 Thus, of our newly extracted term pairs a relatively small proportion are rediscovered dictionary entries. [sent-331, score-0.715]
</p><p>83 We also checked our evaluation data to see what proportion of the assessed term pairs were already to be found in the GIZA++ dictionaries. [sent-332, score-0.658]
</p><p>84 A total of 600 term pairs were put in front of the judges of which 198 (33%) were word-word term pairs. [sent-333, score-1.124]
</p><p>85 Of these 15 (less than 8% of the word-word pairs and less then 3% ofthe overall assessed set of assessed term pairs) were word-word pairs already in the dictionaries. [sent-334, score-0.807]
</p><p>86 We conclude that our evaluation results are not unduly affected by assessing term pairs which were given to the algorithm. [sent-335, score-0.615]
</p><p>87 To achieve this, training data consisting of term pairs along with contextual information is required. [sent-353, score-0.615]
</p><p>88 Partial Translation The assessors assigned 6 7% of the term pairs in the IT domain and 12 16% in the automotive domain to categories 2 and 3. [sent-357, score-0.967]
</p><p>89 In both categories the term pairs share translations or cognates. [sent-358, score-0.714]
</p><p>90 In category 2 this will be the entire translation of one term in the other such as the following examples. [sent-360, score-0.66]
</p><p>91 In example (4), again the translation of the German term is entirely found in the English term, but as in the previous example, one of the English words systems in this case, has no match within the German term. [sent-362, score-0.669]
</p><p>92 Another application of the extracted term pairs is to use them to enhance existing parallel corpora to train SMT systems. [sent-366, score-0.715]
</p><p>93 5In our data it is always the case that the target term is entirely translated within the English one and the other way round. [sent-370, score-0.736]
</p><p>94 409  6  Conclusion  In this paper we presented an approach to align terms identified by a monolingual term extractor in bilingual comparable corpora using a binary classifier. [sent-371, score-1.017]
</p><p>95 Each candidate term pair was pre-processed to extract various features which are cognate-based or dictionary-based. [sent-373, score-0.556]
</p><p>96 In the manual evaluation we had our algorithm extract pairs of terms from Wikipedia articles articles forming comparable corpora in the IT and automotive domains and asked native speakers to categorize a selection of the term pairs into categories reflecting the level of translation of the terms. [sent-378, score-1.378]
</p><p>97 In the manual evaluation we used the English-German language pair and showed that over 80% of the extracted term pairs were exact translations in the IT domain and over 60% in the automotive domain. [sent-379, score-1.095]
</p><p>98 For both domains over 90% of the extracted term pairs were either exact or partial translations. [sent-380, score-0.695]
</p><p>99 Exploring ways to add contextual or distributional features to our term representations is also an avenue for future work, though it clearly significantly complicates the approach, one of whose advantages is its simplicitiy. [sent-382, score-0.509]
</p><p>100 We would also like to thank partners at Tilde SIA and at the University of Zagreb for supplying the TWSC term extraction tool, developed within the EU funded project ACCURAT. [sent-388, score-0.589]

<p>Author: Tyler Baldwin ; Yunyao Li ; Bogdan Alexe ; Ioana R. Stanoi</p><p>Abstract: While the resolution of term ambiguity is important for information extraction (IE) systems, the cost of resolving each instance of an entity can be prohibitively expensive on large datasets. To combat this, this work looks at ambiguity detection at the term, rather than the instance, level. By making a judgment about the general ambiguity of a term, a system is able to handle ambiguous and unambiguous cases differently, improving throughput and quality. To address the term ambiguity detection problem, we employ a model that combines data from language models, ontologies, and topic modeling. Results over a dataset of entities from four product domains show that the proposed approach achieves significantly above baseline F-measure of 0.96.</p><p>3 0.17716312 <a title="154-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Context_Vector_Disambiguation_for_Bilingual_Lexicon_Extraction_from_Comparable_Corpora.html">93 acl-2013-Context Vector Disambiguation for Bilingual Lexicon Extraction from Comparable Corpora</a></p>

However, when it comes to a language pair or a different domain without any bilingual resources, the traditional SMT loses its power. Recently, some research works study the unsupervised SMT for inducing a simple word-based translation model from the monolingual corpora. It successfully bypasses the constraint of bitext for SMT and obtains a relatively promising result. In this paper, we take a step forward and propose a simple but effective method to induce a phrase-based model from the monolingual corpora given an automatically-induced translation lexicon or a manually-edited translation dictionary. We apply our method for the domain adaptation task and the extensive experiments show that our proposed method can substantially improve the translation quality. 1</p><p>5 0.16170041 <a title="154-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-An_Open_Source_Toolkit_for_Quantitative_Historical_Linguistics.html">48 acl-2013-An Open Source Toolkit for Quantitative Historical Linguistics</a></p>
<p>Author: Johann-Mattis List ; Steven Moran</p><p>Abstract: Given the increasing interest and development of computational and quantitative methods in historical linguistics, it is important that scholars have a basis for documenting, testing, evaluating, and sharing complex workflows. We present a novel open-source toolkit for quantitative tasks in historical linguistics that offers these features. This toolkit also serves as an interface between existing software packages and frequently used data formats, and it provides implementations of new and existing algorithms within a homogeneous framework. We illustrate the toolkit’s functionality with an exemplary workflow that starts with raw language data and ends with automatically calculated phonetic alignments, cognates and borrowings. We then illustrate evaluation metrics on gold standard datasets that are provided with the toolkit.</p><p>6 0.15859205 <a title="154-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Building_Comparable_Corpora_Based_on_Bilingual_LDA_Model.html">74 acl-2013-Building Comparable Corpora Based on Bilingual LDA Model</a></p>

In our approach we treat bilingual term extraction as a classification problem. For classification we use an SVM binary classifier and training data taken from the EUROVOC thesaurus. We test our approach on a held-out test set from EUROVOC and perform precision, recall and f-measure evaluations for 20 European language pairs. The performance of our classifier reaches the 100% precision level for many language pairs. We also perform manual evaluation on bilingual terms extracted from English-German term-tagged comparable corpora. The results of this manual evaluation showed 60-83% of the term pairs generated are exact translations and over 90% exact or partial translations.</p><p>2 0.80283016 <a title="154-lsi-2" href="./acl-2013-Context_Vector_Disambiguation_for_Bilingual_Lexicon_Extraction_from_Comparable_Corpora.html">93 acl-2013-Context Vector Disambiguation for Bilingual Lexicon Extraction from Comparable Corpora</a></p>

<p>Author: Lian Tze Lim ; Lay-Ki Soon ; Tek Yong Lim ; Enya Kong Tang ; Bali Ranaivo-Malancon</p><p>Abstract: Current approaches for word sense disambiguation and translation selection typically require lexical resources or large bilingual corpora with rich information fields and annotations, which are often infeasible for under-resourced languages. We extract translation context knowledge from a bilingual comparable corpora of a richer-resourced language pair, and inject it into a multilingual lexicon. The multilin- gual lexicon can then be used to perform context-dependent lexical lookup on texts of any language, including under-resourced ones. Evaluations on a prototype lookup tool, trained on a English–Malay bilingual Wikipedia corpus, show a precision score of 0.65 (baseline 0.55) and mean reciprocal rank score of 0.81 (baseline 0.771). Based on the early encouraging results, the context-dependent lexical lookup tool may be developed further into an intelligent reading aid, to help users grasp the gist of a second or foreign language text.</p><p>4 0.70914054 <a title="154-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Bootstrapping_Entity_Translation_on_Weakly_Comparable_Corpora.html">71 acl-2013-Bootstrapping Entity Translation on Weakly Comparable Corpora</a></p>

Unlike the previous approaches relying on the “symmetry” found in parallel corpora, the proposed method is tolerant to asymmetry often found in comparable corpora, by distinguishing different semantics of relations of entity pairs to selectively propagate seed entity translations on weakly comparable corpora. Our experimental results on English-Chinese corpora show that our selective propagation approach outperforms the previous approaches in named entity translation in terms of the mean reciprocal rank by up to 0.16 for organization names, and 0.14 in a low com- parability case.</p><p>5 0.70854247 <a title="154-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-An_Information_Theoretic_Approach_to_Bilingual_Word_Clustering.html">47 acl-2013-An Information Theoretic Approach to Bilingual Word Clustering</a></p>

The monolingual component of our objective is the average mutual information of clusters of adjacent words in each language, while the bilingual component is the average mutual information of the aligned clusters. To evaluate our method, we use the word clusters in an NER system and demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in F1 score when using bilingual word clusters instead of monolingual clusters.</p><p>6 0.70766729 <a title="154-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Name-aware_Machine_Translation.html">255 acl-2013-Name-aware Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Roman Klinger ; Philipp Cimiano</p><p>Abstract: Opinion mining is often regarded as a classification or segmentation task, involving the prediction of i) subjective expressions, ii) their target and iii) their polarity. Intuitively, these three variables are bidirectionally interdependent, but most work has either attempted to predict them in isolation or proposing pipeline-based approaches that cannot model the bidirectional interaction between these variables. Towards better understanding the interaction between these variables, we propose a model that allows for analyzing the relation of target and subjective phrases in both directions, thus providing an upper bound for the impact of a joint model in comparison to a pipeline model. We report results on two public datasets (cameras and cars), showing that our model outperforms state-ofthe-art models, as well as on a new dataset consisting of Twitter posts.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.86078972 <a title="154-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Extracting_bilingual_terminologies_from_comparable_corpora.html">154 acl-2013-Extracting bilingual terminologies from comparable corpora</a></p>

<p>Author: Gourab Kundu ; Vivek Srikumar ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Given that structured output prediction is typically performed over entire datasets, one natural question is whether it is possible to re-use computation from earlier inference instances to speed up inference for future instances. Amortized inference has been proposed as a way to accomplish this. In this paper, first, we introduce a new amortized inference algorithm called the Margin-based Amortized Inference, which uses the notion of structured margin to identify inference problems for which previous solutions are provably optimal. Second, we introduce decomposed amortized inference, which is designed to address very large inference problems, where earlier amortization methods become less ef- fective. This approach works by decomposing the output structure and applying amortization piece-wise, thus increasing the chance that we can re-use previous solutions for parts of the output structure. These parts are then combined to a global coherent solution using Lagrangian relaxation. In our experiments, using the NLP tasks of semantic role labeling and entityrelation extraction, we demonstrate that with the margin-based algorithm, we need to call the inference engine only for a third of the test examples. Further, we show that the decomposed variant of margin-based amortized inference achieves a greater reduction in the number of inference calls.</p><p>4 0.7861349 <a title="154-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Cross-lingual_Transfer_of_Semantic_Role_Labeling_Models.html">98 acl-2013-Cross-lingual Transfer of Semantic Role Labeling Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Mikhail Kozhevnikov ; Ivan Titov</p><p>Abstract: Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) has become one of the standard tasks of natural language processing and proven useful as a source of information for a number of other applications. We address the problem of transferring an SRL model from one language to another using a shared feature representation. This approach is then evaluated on three language pairs, demonstrating competitive performance as compared to a state-of-the-art unsupervised SRL system and a cross-lingual annotation projection baseline. We also consider the contribution of different aspects of the feature representation to the performance of the model and discuss practical applicability of this method. 1 Background and Motivation Semantic role labeling has proven useful in many natural language processing tasks, such as question answering (Shen and Lapata, 2007; Kaisser and Webber, 2007), textual entailment (Sammons et al., 2009), machine translation (Wu and Fung, 2009; Liu and Gildea, 2010; Gao and Vogel, 2011) and dialogue systems (Basili et al., 2009; van der Plas et al., 2009). Multiple models have been designed to automatically predict semantic roles, and a considerable amount of data has been annotated to train these models, if only for a few more popular languages. As the annotation is costly, one would like to leverage existing resources to minimize the human effort required to construct a model for a new language. A number of approaches to the construction of semantic role labeling models for new languages have been proposed. On one end of the scale is unsupervised SRL, such as Grenager and Manning (2006), which requires some expert knowledge, but no labeled data. It clusters together arguments that should bear the same semantic role, but does not assign a particular role to each cluster. On the other end is annotating a new dataset from scratch. There are also intermediate options, which often make use of similarities between languages. This way, if an accurate model exists for one language, it should help simplify the construction of a model for another, related language. The approaches in this third group often use parallel data to bridge the gap between languages. Cross-lingual annotation projection systems (Pad o´ and Lapata, 2009), for example, propagate information directly via word alignment links. However, they are very sensitive to the quality of parallel data, as well as the accuracy of a sourcelanguage model on it. An alternative approach, known as cross-lingual model transfer, or cross-lingual model adaptation, consists of modifying a source-language model to make it directly applicable to a new language. This usually involves constructing a shared feature representation across the two languages. McDonald et al. (201 1) successfully apply this idea to the transfer of dependency parsers, using part-of- speech tags as the shared representation of words. A later extension of T ¨ackstr o¨m et al. (2012) enriches this representation with cross-lingual word clusters, considerably improving the performance. In the case of SRL, a shared representation that is purely syntactic is likely to be insufficient, since structures with different semantics may be realized by the same syntactic construct, for example “in August” vs “in Britain”. However with the help of recently introduced cross-lingual word represen1190 Proce dingsS o f ita h,e B 5u1lgsta Arinan,u Aaulg Musete 4ti-n9g 2 o0f1 t3h.e ? Ac s2s0o1ci3a Atiosnso fcoirat Cio nm foprut Caotimonpaulta Lti nognuails Lti cnsg,u piasgteics 1 90–120 , tations, such as the cross-lingual clustering mentioned above or cross-lingual distributed word representations of Klementiev et al. (2012), we may be able to transfer models of shallow semantics in a similar fashion. In this work we construct a shared feature representation for a pair of languages, employing crosslingual representations of syntactic and lexical information, train a semantic role labeling model on one language and apply it to the other one. This approach yields an SRL model for a new language at a very low cost, effectively requiring only a source language model and parallel data. We evaluate on five (directed) language pairs EN-ZH, ZH-EN, EN-CZ, CZ-EN and EN-FR, where EN, FR, CZ and ZH denote English, French, Czech and Chinese, respectively. The transferred model is compared against two baselines: an unsupervised SRL system and a model trained on the output of a cross-lingual annotation projection system. In the next section we will describe our setup, then in section 3 present the shared feature representation we use, discuss the evaluation data and other technical aspects in section 4, present the results and conclude with an overview of related work. – 2 Setup The purpose of the study is not to develop a yet another semantic role labeling system any existing SRL system can (after some modification) be used in this setup but to assess the practical applicability of cross-lingual model transfer to this – – problem, compare it against the alternatives and identify its strong/weak points depending on a particular setup. 2.1 Semantic Role Labeling Model We consider the dependency-based version of semantic role labeling as described in Haji cˇ et al. (2009) and transfer an SRL model from one language to another. We only consider verbal predicates and ignore the predicate disambiguation stage. We also assume that the predicate identification information is available in most languages it can be obtained using a relatively simple heuristic based on part-of-speech tags. The model performs argument identification and classification (Johansson and Nugues, 2008) separately in a pipeline first each candidate is classified as being or not being a head of an argument phrase with respect to the predicate in question and then each of the arguments is assigned a role from a given inventory. The model is factorized over arguments the decisions regarding the classification of different arguments are made in– – – dependently of each other. With respect to the use of syntactic annotation we consider two options: using an existing dependency parser for the target language and obtaining one by means of cross-lingual transfer (see section 4.2). Following McDonald et al. (201 1), we assume that a part-of-speech tagger is available for the target language. 2.2 SRL in the Low-resource Setting Several approaches have been proposed to obtain an SRL model for a new language with little or no manual annotation. Unsupervised SRL models (Lang and Lapata, 2010) cluster the arguments of predicates in a given corpus according to their semantic roles. The performance of such models can be impressive, especially for those languages where semantic roles correlate strongly with syntactic relation of the argument to its predicate. However, assigning meaningful role labels to the resulting clusters requires additional effort and the model’s parameters generally need some adjustment for every language. If the necessary resources are already available for a closely related language, they can be utilized to facilitate the construction of a model for the target language. This can be achieved either by means of cross-lingual annotation projection (Yarowsky et al., 2001) or by cross-lingual model transfer (Zeman and Resnik, 2008). This last approach is the one we are considering in this work, and the other two options are treated as baselines. The unsupervised model will be further referred to as UNSUP and the projection baseline as PROJ. 2.3 Evaluation Measures We use the F1 measure as a metric for the argument identification stage and accuracy as an aggregate measure of argument classification performance. When comparing to the unsupervised SRL system the clustering evaluation measures are used instead. These are purity and collocation 1191 N1Ximajx|Gj∩ Ci| CO =N1Xjmiax|Gj∩ Ci|, PU = where Ci is the set of arguments in the i-th induced cluster, Gj is the set of arguments in the jth gold cluster and N is the total number of arguments. We report the harmonic mean ofthe two (Lang and Lapata, 2011) and denote it F1c to avoid confusing it with the supervised metric. 3 Model Transfer The idea of this work is to abstract the model away from the particular source language and apply it to a new one. This setup requires that we use the same feature representation for both languages, for example part-of-speech tags and dependency relation labels should be from the same inventory. Some features are not applicable to certain lan- guages because the corresponding phenomena are absent in them. For example, consider a strongly inflected language and an analytic one. While the latter can usually convey the information encoded in the word form in the former one (number, gender, etc.), finding a shared feature representation for such information is non-trivial. In this study we will confine ourselves to those features that are applicable to all languages in question, namely: part-of-speech tags, syntactic dependency structures and representations of the word’s identity. 3.1 Lexical Information We train a model on one language and apply it to a different one. In order for this to work, the words of the two languages have to be mapped into a common feature space. It is also desirable that closely related words from both languages have similar representations in this space. Word mapping. The first option is simply to use the source language words as the shared representation. Here every source language word would have itself as its representation and every target word would map into a source word that corresponds to it. In other words, we supply the model with a gloss of the target sentence. The mapping (bilingual dictionary) we use is derived from a word-aligned parallel corpus, by identifying, for each word in the target language, the word in the source language it is most often aligned to. Cross-lingual clusters. There is no guarantee that each of the words in the evaluation data is present in our dictionary, nor that the corresponding source-language word is present in the training data, so the model would benefit from the ability to generalize over closely related words. This can, for example, be achieved by using cross-lingual word clusters induced in T ¨ackstr o¨m et al. (2012). We incorporate these clusters as features into our model. 3.2 Syntactic Information Part-of-speech Tags. We map part-of-speech tags into the universal tagset following Petrov et al. (2012). This may have a negative effect on the performance of a monolingual model, since most part-of-speech tagsets are more fine-grained than the universal POS tags considered here. For example Penn Treebank inventory contains 36 tags and the universal POS tagset only 12. Since the finergrained POS tags often reflect more languagespecific phenomena, however, they would only be useful for very closely related languages in the cross-lingual setting. The universal part-of-speech tags used in evaluation are derived from gold-standard annotation for all languages except French, where predicted ones had to be used instead. Dependency Structure. Another important aspect of syntactic information is the dependency structure. Most dependency relation inventories are language-specific, and finding a shared representation for them is a challenging problem. One could map dependency relations into a simplified form that would be shared between languages, as it is done for part-of-speech tags in Petrov et al. (2012). The extent to which this would be useful, however, depends on the similarity of syntactic-semantic in– terfaces of the languages in question. In this work we discard the dependency relation labels where the inventories do not match and only consider the unlabeled syntactic dependency graph. Some discrepancies, such as variations in attachment order, may be present even there, but this does not appear to be the case with the datasets we use for evaluation. If a target language is poor in resources, one can obtain a dependency parser for the target language by means of cross-lingual model transfer (Zeman and Resnik, 2008). We 1192 take this into account and evaluate both using the original dependency structures and the ones obtained by means of cross-lingual model transfer. 3.3 The Model The model we use is based on that of Bj ¨orkelund et al. (2009). It is comprised of a set of linear classifiers trained using Liblinear (Fan et al., 2008). The feature model was modified to accommodate the cross-lingual cluster features and the reranker component was not used. We do not model the interaction between different argument roles in the same predicate. While this has been found useful, in the cross-lingual setup one has to be careful with the assumptions made. For example, modeling the sequence of roles using a Markov chain (Thompson et al., 2003) may not work well in the present setting, especially between distant languages, as the order or arguments is not necessarily preserved. Most constraints that prove useful for SRL (Chang et al., 2007) also require customization when applied to a new language, and some rely on languagespecific resources, such as a valency lexicon. Taking into account the interaction between different arguments of a predicate is likely to improve the performance of the transferred model, but this is outside the scope of this work. 3.4 Feature Selection Compatibility of feature representations is necessary but not sufficient for successful model transfer. We have to make sure that the features we use are predictive of similar outcomes in the two languages as well. Depending on the pair of languages in question, different aspects of the feature representation will retain or lose their predictive power. We can be reasonably certain that the identity of an argument word is predictive of its semantic role in any language, but it might or might not be true of, for example, the word directly preceding the argument word. It is therefore important to pre- SCPDGylOespoSntreslTabunc1lra:obsFel-daitnguplrdoaeusntpagd-elronwfu-dcsopeyrnsd c.eylafguhtorsia mepgnrhs vent the model from capturing overly specific aspects of the source language, which we do by confining the model to first-order features. We also avoid feature selection, which, performed on the source language, is unlikely to help the model to better generalize to the target one. The experiments confirm that feature selection and the use of second-order features degrade the performance of the transferred model. 3.5 Feature Groups For each word, we use its part-of-speech tag, cross-lingual cluster id, word identity (glossed, when evaluating on the target language) and its dependency relation to its parent. Features associated with an argument word include the attributes of the predicate word, the argument word, its parent, siblings and children, and the words directly preceding and following it. Also included are the sequences of part-of-speech tags and dependency relations on the path between the predicate and the argument. Since we are also interested in the impact of different aspects of the feature representation, we divide the features into groups as summarized in table 1 and evaluate their respective contributions to the performance of the model. If a feature group is enabled the model has access to the corre– sponding source of information. For example, if only POS group is enabled, the model relies on the part-of-speech tags of the argument, the predicate and the words to the right and left of the argument word. If Synt is enabled too, it also uses the POS tags of the argument’s parent, children and siblings. Word order information constitutes an implicit group that is always available. It includes the Pos it ion feature, which indicates whether the argument is located to the left or to the right of the predicate, and allows the model to look up the attributes of the words directly preceding and following the argument word. The model we compare against the baselines uses all applicable feature groups (Deprel is only used in EN-CZ and CZ-EN experiments with original syntax). 4 Evaluation 4.1 Datasets and Preprocessing Evaluation of the cross-lingual model transfer requires a rather specific kind of dataset. Namely, the data in both languages has to be annotated 1193 with the same set of semantic roles following the same (or compatible) guidelines, which is seldom the case. We have identified three language pairs for which such resources are available: EnglishChinese, English-Czech and English-French. The evaluation datasets for English and Chinese are those from the CoNLL Shared Task 2009 (Haji ˇc et al., 2009) (henceforth CoNLL-ST). Their annotation in the CoNLL-ST is not identical, but the guidelines for “core” semantic roles are similar (Kingsbury et al., 2004), so we evaluate only on core roles here. The data for the second language pair is drawn from the Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0 (Haji ˇc et al., 2012), which we converted to a format similar to that of CoNLL-ST1 . The original annotation uses the tectogrammatical representation (Haji ˇc, 2002) and an inventory of semantic roles (or functors), most of which are interpretable across various predicates. Also note that the syntactic anno- tation of English and Czech in PCEDT 2.0 is quite similar (to the extent permitted by the difference in the structure of the two languages) and we can use the dependency relations in our experiments. For English-French, the English CoNLL-ST dataset was used as a source and the model was evaluated on the manually annotated dataset from van der Plas et al. (201 1). The latter contains one thousand sentences from the French part ofthe Europarl (Koehn, 2005) corpus, annotated with semantic roles following an adapted version of PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) guidelines. The authors perform annotation projection from English to French, using a joint model of syntax and semantics and employing heuristics for filtering. We use a model trained on the output of this projection system as one of the baselines. The evaluation dataset is relatively small in this case, so we perform the transfer only one-way, from English to French. The part-of-speech tags in all datasets were replaced with the universal POS tags of Petrov et al. (2012). For Czech, we have augmented the map- pings to account for the tags that were not present in the datasets from which the original mappings were derived. Namely, tag “t” is mapped to “VERB” and “Y” to “PRON”. We use parallel data to construct a bilingual dictionary used in word mapping, as well as in the projection baseline. For English-Czech – 1see http://www.ml4nlp.de/code-and-data/treex2conll and English-French, the data is drawn from Europarl (Koehn, 2005), for English-Chinese from MultiUN (Eisele and Chen, 2010). The word alignments were obtained using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) and the intersection heuristic. – 4.2 Syntactic Transfer In the low-resource setting, we cannot always rely on the availability of an accurate dependency parser for the target language. If one is not available, the natural solution would be to use crosslingual model transfer to obtain it. Unfortunately, the models presented in the previous work, such as Zeman and Resnik (2008), McDonald et al. (201 1) and T ¨ackstr o¨m et al. (2012), were not made available, so we reproduced the direct transfer algorithm of McDonald et al. (201 1), using Malt parser (Nivre, 2008) and the same set of features. We did not reimplement the projected transfer algorithm, however, and used the default training procedure instead of perceptron-based learning. The dependency structure thus obtained is, of course, only a rough approximation even a much more sophisticated algorithm may not perform well when transferring syntax between such languages as Czech and English, given the inherent difference in their structure. The scores are shown in table 2. We will henceforth refer to the syntactic annotations that were provided with the datasets as original, as opposed to the annotations obtained by means of syntactic transfer. – 4.3 Baselines Unsupervised Baseline: We are using a version of the unsupervised semantic role induction system of Titov and Klementiev (2012a) adapted to SetupUAS, % Table2:SyntaciE C ZcN HNt- rE ZaCFnN HZRsfer34 692567acuracy,unlabe dat- tachment score (percent). Note that in case of French we evaluate against the output of a supervised system, since manual annotation is not available for this dataset. This score does not reflect the true performance of syntactic transfer. 1194 the shared feature representation considered in order to make the scores comparable with those of the transfer model and, more importantly, to enable evaluation on transferred syntax. Note that the original system, tailored to a more expressive language-specific syntactic representation and equipped with heuristics to identify active/passive voice and other phenomena, achieves higher scores than those we report here. Projection Baseline: The projection baseline we use for English-Czech and English-Chinese is a straightforward one: we label the source side of a parallel corpus using the source-language model, then identify those verbs on the target side that are aligned to a predicate, mark them as predicates and propagate the argument roles in the same fashion. A model is then trained on the resulting training data and applied to the test set. For English-French we instead use the output of a fully featured projection model of van der Plas et al. (201 1), published in the CLASSiC project. 5 Results In order to ensure that the results are consistent, the test sets, except for the French one, were partitioned into five equal parts (of 5 to 10 thousand sentences each, depending on the dataset) and the evaluation performed separately on each one. All evaluation figures for English, Czech or Chinese below are the average values over the five subsets. In case of French, the evaluation dataset is too small to split it further, so instead we ran the evaluation five times on a randomly selected 80% sample of the evaluation data and averaged over those. In both cases the results are consistent over the subsets, the standard deviation does not exceed 0.5% for the transfer system and projection baseline and 1% for the unsupervised system. 5.1 Argument Identification We summarize the results in table 3. Argument identification is known to rely heavily on syntactic information, so it is unsurprising that it proves inaccurate when transferred syntax is used. Our simple projection baseline suffers from the same problem. Even with original syntactic information available, the performance of argument identification is moderate. Note that the model of (van der Plas et al., 2011), though relying on more expressive syntax, only outperforms the transferred system by 3% (F1) on this task.

Most unsupervised SRL approaches assume that the argument identification is performed by some external means, for example heuristically (Lang and Lapata, 2011). Such heuristics or unsupervised approaches to argument identification (Abend et al., 2009) can also be used in the present setup. 5.2 Argument Classification In the following tables, TRANS column contains the results for the transferred system, UNSUP for the unsupervised baseline and PROJ for projection baseline.

In the more realistic scenario with transferred syn- tax, however, the transferred model proves more accurate. In table 5 we compare the transferred system with the projection baseline. It is easy to see that the scores vary strongly depending on the language pair, due to both the difference in the annotation scheme used and the degree of relatedness between the languages. The drop in performance when transferring the model to another language is large in every case, though, see table 6.

We also include the individual F1 scores for the top-10 most frequent labels for EN-CZ transfer with original syntax in table 7.

Table 8 contains the results for English-French. FeaturesOrigTrans ferent feature subsets, using original and transferred syntactic information. The fact that the model performs slightly better with transferred syntax may be explained by two factors. Firstly, as we already mentioned, the original syntactic annotation is also produced automatically. Secondly, in the model transfer setup it is more important how closely the syntacticsemantic interface on the target side resembles that on the source side than how well it matches the “true” structure of the target language, and in this respect a transferred dependency parser may have an advantage over one trained on target-language data. The high impact of the Glos s features here 1196 may be partly attributed to the fact that the mapping is derived from the same corpus as the evaluation data Europarl (Koehn, 2005) and partly by the similarity between English and French in terms of word order, usage of articles and prepositions. The moderate contribution of the crosslingual cluster features are likely due to the insufficient granularity of the clustering for this task. For more distant language pairs, the contributions of individual feature groups are less interpretable, so we only highlight a few observations. First of all, both EN-CZ and CZ-EN benefit noticeably from the use of the original syntactic annotation, including dependency relations, but not from the transferred syntax, most likely due to the low syntactic transfer performance. Both perform better when lexical information is available, although – – the improvement is not as significant as in the case of French only up to 5%. The situation with Chinese is somewhat complicated in that adding lexical information here fails to yield an improvement in terms of the metric considered. This is likely due to the fact that we consider only the core roles, which can usually be predicted with high accuracy based on syntactic information alone. – 6 Related Work Development of robust statistical models for core NLP tasks is a challenging problem, and adaptation of existing models to new languages presents a viable alternative to exhaustive annotation for each language. Although the models thus obtained are generally imperfect, they can be further refined for a particular language and domain using techniques such as active learning (Settles, 2010; Chen et al., 2011). Cross-lingual annotation projection (Yarowsky et al., 2001) approaches have been applied ex- tensively to a variety of tasks, including POS tagging (Xi and Hwa, 2005; Das and Petrov, 2011), morphology segmentation (Snyder and Barzilay, 2008), verb classification (Merlo et al., 2002), mention detection (Zitouni and Florian, 2008), LFG parsing (Wr o´blewska and Frank, 2009), information extraction (Kim et al., 2010), SRL (Pad o´ and Lapata, 2009; van der Plas et al., 2011; Annesi and Basili, 2010; Tonelli and Pianta, 2008), dependency parsing (Naseem et al., 2012; Ganchev et al., 2009; Smith and Eisner, 2009; Hwa et al., 2005) or temporal relation prediction (Spreyer and Frank, 2008). Interestingly, it has also been used to propagate morphosyntactic information between old and modern versions of the same language (Meyer, 2011). Cross-lingual model transfer methods (McDonald et al., 2011; Zeman and Resnik, 2008; Durrett et al., 2012; Søgaard, 2011; Lopez et al., 2008) have also been receiving much attention recently. The basic idea behind model transfer is similar to that of cross-lingual annotation projection, as we can see from the way parallel data is used in, for example, McDonald et al. (201 1). A crucial component of direct transfer approaches is the unified feature representation. There are at least two such representations of lexical information (Klementiev et al., 2012; T ¨ackstr o¨m et al., 2012), but both work on word level. This makes it hard to account for phenomena that are expressed differently in the languages considered, for example the syntactic function of a certain word may be indicated by a preposition, inflection or word order, depending on the language. Accurate representation of such information would require an extra level of abstraction (Haji ˇc, 2002). A side-effect ofusing adaptation methods is that we are forced to use the same annotation scheme for the task in question (SRL, in our case), which in turn simplifies the development of cross-lingual tools for downstream tasks. Such representations are also likely to be useful in machine translation. Unsupervised semantic role labeling methods (Lang and Lapata, 2010; Lang and Lapata, 2011; Titov and Klementiev, 2012a; Lorenzo and Cerisara, 2012) also constitute an alternative to cross-lingual model transfer. For an overview of of semi-supervised approaches we refer the reader to Titov and Klementiev (2012b). 7 Conclusion We have considered the cross-lingual model transfer approach as applied to the task of semantic role labeling and observed that for closely related languages it performs comparably to annotation projection approaches. It allows one to quickly construct an SRL model for a new language without manual annotation or language-specific heuristics, provided an accurate model is available for one of the related languages along with a certain amount of parallel data for the two languages. While an1197 notation projection approaches require sentenceand word-aligned parallel data and crucially depend on the accuracy of the syntactic parsing and SRL on the source side of the parallel corpus, cross-lingual model transfer can be performed using only a bilingual dictionary. Unsupervised SRL approaches have their advantages, in particular when no annotated data is available for any of the related languages and there is a syntactic parser available for the target one, but the annotation they produce is not always sufficient. In applications such as Information Retrieval it is preferable to have precise labels, rather than just clusters of arguments, for example. Also note that when applying cross-lingual model transfer in practice, one can improve upon the performance of the simplistic model we use for evaluation, for example by picking the features manually, taking into account the properties of the target language. Domain adaptation techniques can also be employed to adjust the model to the target language.

<p>Author: Spence Green ; Sida Wang ; Daniel Cer ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: We present a fast and scalable online method for tuning statistical machine translation models with large feature sets. The standard tuning algorithm—MERT—only scales to tens of features. Recent discriminative algorithms that accommodate sparse features have produced smaller than expected translation quality gains in large systems. Our method, which is based on stochastic gradient descent with an adaptive learning rate, scales to millions of features and tuning sets with tens of thousands of sentences, while still converging after only a few epochs. Large-scale experiments on Arabic-English and Chinese-English show that our method produces significant translation quality gains by exploiting sparse features. Equally important is our analysis, which suggests techniques for mitigating overfitting and domain mismatch, and applies to other recent discriminative methods for machine translation. 1</p><p>6 0.76019204 <a title="154-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Fast_and_Accurate_Shift-Reduce_Constituent_Parsing.html">155 acl-2013-Fast and Accurate Shift-Reduce Constituent Parsing</a></p>

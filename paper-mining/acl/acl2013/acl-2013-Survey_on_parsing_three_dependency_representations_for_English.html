</p><p>4 Comparing parsing accuracies in various setups, we study the interactions of these three aspects and analyze which configurations are easier to learn for a dependency parser. [sent-5, score-0.212]
</p><p>5 1 Introduction Dependency parsing is one of the mainstream research areas in natural language processing. [sent-6, score-0.059]
</p><p>6 There were several shared tasks organized on dependency parsing (CoNLL 2006–2007) and labeled dependencies (CoNLL 2008–2009) and there were a number of attempts to compare various dependencies intrinsically, e. [sent-11, score-0.227]

</p><p>9 We parse the formats and compare accuracies in all configurations in order to determine how parsers, dependencyrepresentations andgrammatical tagging methods interact with each other in application to automatic syntactic analysis. [sent-27, score-0.123]
</p><p>10 SB and CD are derived automatically from phrase structures of Penn Treebank to accommodate the needs of fast and accurate dependency parsing, whereas DT is rooted in the formal grammar theory HPSG and is independent from any specific treebank. [sent-28, score-0.126]
</p><p>11 For DT we gain more expressivity from the underlying linguistic theory, which challenges parsing with statistical tools. [sent-29, score-0.078]

</p><p>13 We recompute similarities on a larger treebank and check whether parsing results reflect them. [sent-32, score-0.086]
</p><p>14 (2012) investigate which dependency representations of several syntactic structures are easier to parse with supervised versions of the Klein and Manning (2004) parser, ClearParser (Choi and Nicolov, 2009), MST Parser, Malt and the Easy First Non-directional parser (Goldberg and Elhadad, 2010). [sent-35, score-0.246]
</p><p>15 The results imply that all parsers consistently perform better when (a) coordination has one of the conjuncts as the head rather than the coordinating conjunction; 31  Sofia, BulPgraoricea,ed Ainug us otf 4 t-h9e 2 A0C13L. [sent-36, score-0.22]

</p><p>17 Intristic evaluation results show that all parsers have the highest accuracies with the CoNLL-X format. [sent-42, score-0.1]

</p><p>21 3 Dependency schemes In this work we extract DeepBank data in the form of bilexical syntactic dependencies, DELPH-IN Syntactic Derivation Tree (DT) format. [sent-60, score-0.095]
</p><p>22 We obtain the exact same sentences in Stanford Basic (SB) format from the automatic conversion of the PTB with the Stanford parser (de Marneffe et al. [sent-61, score-0.175]
</p><p>23 SB and CD represent the way to convert PTB to bilexical dependencies; in contrast, DT is  grounded in linguistic theory and captures decisions taken in the grammar. [sent-63, score-0.037]
</p><p>24 Figure 1demonstrates the differences between the formats on the coordination structure. [sent-64, score-0.121]
</p><p>25 (2012), analysis of coordination in SB and CD is easier for a statistical parser to learn; however, as we will see in section 4. [sent-66, score-0.203]
</p><p>26 4 Part-of-speech tags We experimented with two tag sets: PTB tags and lexical types of the ERG grammar - supertags. [sent-69, score-0.273]
</p><p>27 PTB tags determine the part of speech (PoS) and some morphological features, such as number for nouns, degree of comparison for adjectives and adverbs, tense and agreement with person and number of subject for verbs, etc. [sent-70, score-0.126]
</p><p>28 There are 48 tags in the PTB tagset and 1091 supertags in the set of lexical types of the ERG. [sent-79, score-0.707]
</p><p>29 The state-of-the-art accuracy of PoS-tagging on in-domain test data using gold-standard tokenization is roughly 97% for the PTB tagset and approximately 95% for the ERG supertags (Ytrestøl, 2011). [sent-80, score-0.596]
</p><p>30 Supertagging for the ERG grammar is an ongoing research effort and an off-the-shelf supertagger for the ERG is not currently available. [sent-81, score-0.044]
</p><p>31 4  Experiments  In this section we give a detailed analysis of parsing into SB, CD and DT dependencies with Malt, MST and the Bohnet and Nivre (2012) parser. [sent-82, score-0.1]
</p><p>32 1 Setup For Malt and MST we perform the experiments on gold PoS tags, whereas the Bohnet and Nivre (2012) parser predicts PoS tags during testing. [sent-84, score-0.4]
</p><p>33 Prior to each experiment with Malt, we used MaltOptimizer to obtain settings and a feature model; for MST we exploited default configuration; for the Bohnet and Nivre (2012) parser we set the beam parameter to 80 and otherwise employed the default setup. [sent-85, score-0.114]
</p><p>34 With regards to evaluation metrics we use labelled attachment score (LAS), unlabeled attachment score (UAS) and label accuracy (LACC) excluding punctuation. [sent-86, score-0.072]
</p><p>35 Statistical significance was assessed using Dan Bikel’s parsing evaluation comparator1 at the 0. [sent-91, score-0.059]
</p><p>36 We inspect three different aspects in the interpretation of these results: parser, dependency format and  tagset. [sent-93, score-0.128]
</p><p>37 From the parser perspective Malt and MST are not very different in the traditional setup with gold 1http : / / next en s . [sent-95, score-0.221]
</p><p>38 nl / deppar s e-wiki / S o ftwareP age # s coring PTB tags (Table 1, Gold PTB tags). [sent-97, score-0.154]
</p><p>39 The Bohnet and Nivre (2012) parser outperforms Malt on CD and DT and MST on SB, CD and DT with PTB tags even though it does not receive gold PTB tags during test phase but predicts them (Table 2, Predicted PTB tags). [sent-98, score-0.507]
</p><p>40 This is explained by the fact that the Bohnet and Nivre (2012) parser implements a novel approach to parsing: beam-search algorithm with global structure learning. [sent-99, score-0.114]
</p><p>41 MST “loses” more than Malt when parsing SB with gold supertags (Table 1, Gold supertags). [sent-100, score-0.707]
</p><p>42 This parser exploits context features “POS tag of each intervening word between head and dependent” (McDonald et al. [sent-101, score-0.139]
</p><p>43 Due to the far larger size of the supertag set compared to the PTB tagset, such features are sparse and have low fre-  quencies. [sent-103, score-0.042]
</p><p>44 This leads to the lower scores of parsing accuracy for MST. [sent-104, score-0.059]
</p><p>45 For the Bohnet and Nivre (2012) parser the complexity of supertag prediction has significant negative influence on the attachment and labeling accuracies (Table 2, Predicted supertags). [sent-105, score-0.22]
</p><p>46 The addition of gold PTB tags as a feature lifts the performance of the Bohnet and Nivre (2012) parser to the level of performance of Malt and MST on CD with gold supertags and Malt on SB with gold supertags (compare Table 2, Predicted supertags + gold PTB, and Table 1, Gold supertags). [sent-106, score-2.291]
</p><p>47 Both Malt and MST benefit slightly from the combination of gold PTB tags and gold supertags (Table 1, Gold PTB tags + gold supertags). [sent-107, score-1.114]
</p><p>48 For the Bohnet and Nivre (2012) parser we also observe small rise of accuracy when gold supertags are provided as a feature for prediction of PTB tags (compare Predicted PTB tags and Predicted PTB tags + gold supertags sections of Table 2). [sent-108, score-1.788]
</p><p>49 The parsers have different running times: it takes minutes to run an experiment with Malt, about 2 hours with MST and up to a day with the  Bohnet and Nivre (2012) parser. [sent-109, score-0.072]
</p><p>50 From the point of view of the dependency format, SB has the highest LACC and CD is first-rate on UAS for all three parsers in most of the configurations (Tables 1 and 2). [sent-110, score-0.175]
</p><p>51 This means that SB is easier to label and CD is easier to parse structurally. [sent-111, score-0.044]
</p><p>52 DT appears to be a more difficult target format because it is both hard to label and attach in most configurations. [sent-112, score-0.042]
</p><p>53 It is not an unexpected result, since SB and CD are both derived from PTB phrase-structure trees and are oriented to ease dependency parsing task. [sent-113, score-0.145]
</p><p>54 DT is not custom-designed 33 Gold PTB tags  Predicted PTB tags  SDCBT8 M95a. [sent-114, score-0.252]

</p><p>56 Gold supertags: Malt and MST are trained and tested on gold supertags. [sent-146, score-0.107]
</p><p>57 Gold PTB tags + gold supertags: Malt and MST are trained on gold PTB tags and gold supertags. [sent-147, score-0.573]
</p><p>58 1 denotes a feature model in which gold PTB tags function as PoS and gold supertags act as additional features (in CPOSTAG field); 2 stands for the feature model which exploits gold supertags as PoS and uses gold PTB tags as extra features (in CPOSTAG field). [sent-148, score-1.762]

</p><p>64 to dependency parsing and is independent from parsing questions in this sense. [sent-159, score-0.204]
</p><p>65 Contrary to our expectations, the accuracy scores of parsers do not suggest that CD and DT are particularly similar to each other in terms of parsing. [sent-166, score-0.072]
</p><p>66 Inspecting the aspect of tagset we conclude that traditional PTB tags are compatible with SB and CD but do not fit the DT scheme well, while ERG supertags are specific to the ERG framework and do not seem to be appropriate for SB and CD. [sent-167, score-0.707]
</p><p>67 Neither of these findings seem surprising, as PTB tags were developed as part of the treebank from which CD and SB are derived; whereas ERG supertags are closely related to the HPSG syntactic structures captured in DT. [sent-168, score-0.737]
</p><p>68 PTB tags were designed to simplify PoS-tagging whereas supertags were developed to capture information that is required to analyze syntax of HPSG. [sent-169, score-0.686]
</p><p>69 For each PTB tag we collected corresponding  supertags from the gold-standard training set. [sent-170, score-0.541]
</p><p>70 For open word classes such as nouns, adjectives, adverbs and verbs the relation between PTB tags and supertags is many-to-many. [sent-171, score-0.687]
</p><p>71 Thus, supertags do not provide extra level of detalization for PTB tags, but PTB tags and supertags are complementary. [sent-173, score-1.208]
</p><p>72 For this reason their combination results in slight increase of accuracy for all three parsers on all dependency formats (Table 1, Gold PTB tags + gold supertags, and Table 2, Predicted PTB + gold supertags and Predicted supertags + gold PTB). [sent-176, score-1.741]
</p><p>73 The Bohnet and Nivre (2012) parser predicts supertags with an average accuracy of 89. [sent-177, score-0.689]
</p><p>74 3 Error analysis Using the CoNLL-07 evaluation script2 on our test set, for each parser we obtained the error rate distribution over CPOSTAG on SB, CD and DT. [sent-182, score-0.114]
</p><p>75 We automatically collected all sentences that contain 1) attachment errors, 2) label errors, 3) attachment and label errors for VBP, VBZ and VBG made by Malt parser on DT format with PTB PoS. [sent-185, score-0.251]
</p><p>76 For each of these three lexical categories we manually analyzed a random sample of sentences with errors and their corresponding gold-standard versions. [sent-186, score-0.023]
</p><p>77 In many cases such errors are related to the root of the sentence when the verb is either treated as complement or adjunct instead of having a root status or vice versa. [sent-187, score-0.023]
</p><p>78 Sentences with coordination are particularly difficult for the correct attachment and labeling of the VBP (see Figure 2 for an example). [sent-189, score-0.103]
</p><p>79 The error rate of Malt, MST and the Bohnet and Nivre (2012) parser for the coordination is not so high for SB and CD ( 1% and 2% correspondingly with MaltParser, PTB tags) whereas for DT the error rate on the CPOSTAGS is especially high (26% with MaltParser, PTB tags). [sent-191, score-0.2]
</p><p>80 It means that there are many errors on incoming dependency arcs for coordinating conjunctions when parsing DT. [sent-192, score-0.219]
</p><p>81 On outgoing arcs parsers also make more mistakes on DT than on SB and CD. [sent-193, score-0.087]
</p><p>82 , 2012), it is harder to parse coordination headed by coordinating con-  junction. [sent-196, score-0.147]
</p><p>83 Although the approach used in DT is harder for parser to learn, it has some advantages: using SB and CD annotations, we cannot distinguish the two cases illustrated with the sentences (a) and (b): 2http : / / next ens . [sent-197, score-0.139]

</p><p>86 The Bohnet and Nivre (2012) parser succeeds in finding the correct conjucts (shown in bold font) on DT and makes mistakes on SB and CD in some difficult cases like the following ones: a) <. [sent-208, score-0.114]

</p><p>91 From the parser perspective, the Bohnet and Nivre (2012) parser performs better than Malt and MST not only on conventional formats but also on the new representation, although this parser solves a harder task than Malt and MST. [sent-220, score-0.421]
</p><p>92 From the dependency format perspective, DT appeares to be a more difficult target dependency representation than SB and CD. [sent-221, score-0.214]
</p><p>93 This suggests that the expressivity that we gain from the grammar theory (e. [sent-222, score-0.04]
</p><p>94 for coordination) is harder to learn with state-of-the-art dependency parsers. [sent-224, score-0.111]
</p><p>95 PTB tags and supertags are complementary, and for all three parsers we observe slight benefits from being supplied with both types of tags. [sent-226, score-0.739]
</p><p>96 As future work we would like to run more experiments with predicted supertags. [sent-227, score-0.049]
</p><p>97 In the absence of a specialized supertagger, we can follow the pipeline of (Ytrestøl, 2011) who reached the stateof-the-art supertagging accuracy of 95%. [sent-228, score-0.023]

<p>Author: Jinho D. Choi ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach, called selectional branching, which uses confidence estimates to decide when to employ a beam, providing the accuracy of beam search at speeds close to a greedy transition-based dependency parsing approach. Selectional branching is guaranteed to perform a fewer number of transitions than beam search yet performs as accurately. We also present a new transition-based dependency parsing algorithm that gives a complexity of O(n) for projective parsing and an expected linear time speed for non-projective parsing. With the standard setup, our parser shows an unlabeled attachment score of 92.96% and a parsing speed of 9 milliseconds per sentence, which is faster and more accurate than the current state-of-the-art transitionbased parser that uses beam search.</p><p>3 0.12858488 <a title="335-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Easy-First_POS_Tagging_and_Dependency_Parsing_with_Beam_Search.html">132 acl-2013-Easy-First POS Tagging and Dependency Parsing with Beam Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Ji Ma ; Jingbo Zhu ; Tong Xiao ; Nan Yang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we combine easy-first dependency parsing and POS tagging algorithms with beam search and structured perceptron. We propose a simple variant of “early-update” to ensure valid update in the training process.

<p>Author: Bharat Ram Ambati ; Tejaswini Deoskar ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: We show that informative lexical categories from a strongly lexicalised formalism such as Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) can improve dependency parsing of Hindi, a free word order language. We first describe a novel way to obtain a CCG lexicon and treebank from an existing dependency treebank, using a CCG parser. We use the output of a supertagger trained on the CCGbank as a feature for a state-of-the-art Hindi dependency parser (Malt). Our results show that using CCG categories improves the accuracy of Malt on long distance dependencies, for which it is known to have weak rates of recovery.</p><p>5 0.11852951 <a title="335-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-An_Empirical_Examination_of_Challenges_in_Chinese_Parsing.html">44 acl-2013-An Empirical Examination of Challenges in Chinese Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan K. Kummerfeld ; Daniel Tse ; James R. Curran ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Aspects of Chinese syntax result in a distinctive mix of parsing challenges. However, the contribution of individual sources of error to overall difficulty is not well understood. We conduct a comprehensive automatic analysis of error types made by Chinese parsers, covering a broad range of error types for large sets of sentences, enabling the first empirical ranking of Chinese error types by their performance impact. We also investigate which error types are resolved by using gold part-of-speech tags, showing that improving Chinese tagging only addresses certain error types, leaving substantial outstanding challenges.</p><p>6 0.11411456 <a title="335-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Universal_Dependency_Annotation_for_Multilingual_Parsing.html">368 acl-2013-Universal Dependency Annotation for Multilingual Parsing</a></p>

<p>Author: Guangyou Zhou ; Jun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of heterogeneous dependency parsing. In this paper, we present a novel joint inference scheme, which is able to leverage the consensus information between heterogeneous treebanks in the parsing phase. Different from stacked learning methods (Nivre and McDonald, 2008; Martins et al., 2008), which process the dependency parsing in a pipelined way (e.g., a second level uses the first level outputs), in our method, multiple dependency parsing models are coordinated to exchange consensus information. We conduct experiments on Chinese Dependency Treebank (CDT) and Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB), experimental results show that joint infer- ence can bring significant improvements to all state-of-the-art dependency parsers.</p><p>3 0.80306822 <a title="335-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Coordination_Structures_in_Dependency_Treebanks.html">94 acl-2013-Coordination Structures in Dependency Treebanks</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Popel ; David Marecek ; Jan StÄłpanek ; Daniel Zeman ; ZdÄłnÄłk Zabokrtsky</p><p>Abstract: Paratactic syntactic structures are notoriously difficult to represent in dependency formalisms. This has painful consequences such as high frequency of parsing errors related to coordination. In other words, coordination is a pending problem in dependency analysis of natural languages. This paper tries to shed some light on this area by bringing a systematizing view of various formal means developed for encoding coordination structures. We introduce a novel taxonomy of such approaches and apply it to treebanks across a typologically diverse range of 26 languages. In addition, empirical observations on convertibility between selected styles of representations are shown too.</p><p>4 0.76688719 <a title="335-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Universal_Dependency_Annotation_for_Multilingual_Parsing.html">368 acl-2013-Universal Dependency Annotation for Multilingual Parsing</a></p>

<p>Author: Greg Coppola ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: Higher-order dependency features are known to improve dependency parser accuracy. We investigate the incorporation of such features into a cube decoding phrase-structure parser. We find considerable gains in accuracy on the range of standard metrics. What is especially interesting is that we find strong, statistically significant gains on dependency recovery on out-of-domain tests (Brown vs. WSJ). This suggests that higher-order dependency features are not simply overfitting the training material.</p><p>5 0.57104278 <a title="335-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Fast_and_Accurate_Shift-Reduce_Constituent_Parsing.html">155 acl-2013-Fast and Accurate Shift-Reduce Constituent Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Muhua Zhu ; Yue Zhang ; Wenliang Chen ; Min Zhang ; Jingbo Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Shift-reduce dependency parsers give comparable accuracies to their chartbased counterparts, yet the best shiftreduce constituent parsers still lag behind the state-of-the-art. One important reason is the existence of unary nodes in phrase structure trees, which leads to different numbers of shift-reduce actions between different outputs for the same input. This turns out to have a large empirical impact on the framework of global training and beam search. We propose a simple yet effective extension to the shift-reduce process, which eliminates size differences between action sequences in beam-search. Our parser gives comparable accuracies to the state-of-the-art chart parsers. With linear run-time complexity, our parser is over an order of magnitude faster than the fastest chart parser.</p><p>6 0.57042199 <a title="335-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Chinese_Parsing_Exploiting_Characters.html">80 acl-2013-Chinese Parsing Exploiting Characters</a></p>

<p>Author: Bishan Yang ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the task of finegrained opinion extraction the identification of opinion-related entities: the opinion expressions, the opinion holders, and the targets of the opinions, and the relations between opinion expressions and their targets and holders. Most existing approaches tackle the extraction of opinion entities and opinion relations in a pipelined manner, where the interdependencies among different extraction stages are not captured. We propose a joint inference model that leverages knowledge from predictors that optimize subtasks â€“ of opinion extraction, and seeks a globally optimal solution. Experimental results demonstrate that our joint inference approach significantly outperforms traditional pipeline methods and baselines that tackle subtasks in isolation for the problem of opinion extraction.</p><p>3 0.19080627 <a title="67-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Sentiment_Relevance.html">318 acl-2013-Sentiment Relevance</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian Scheible ; Hinrich Schutze</p><p>Abstract: A number of different notions, including subjectivity, have been proposed for distinguishing parts of documents that convey sentiment from those that do not. We propose a new concept, sentiment relevance, to make this distinction and argue that it better reflects the requirements of sentiment analysis systems. We demonstrate experimentally that sentiment relevance and subjectivity are related, but different. Since no large amount of labeled training data for our new notion of sentiment relevance is available, we investigate two semi-supervised methods for creating sentiment relevance classifiers: a distant supervision approach that leverages structured information about the domain of the reviews; and transfer learning on feature representations based on lexical taxonomies that enables knowledge transfer. We show that both methods learn sentiment relevance classifiers that perform well.</p><p>4 0.18331219 <a title="67-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Mining_Opinion_Words_and_Opinion_Targets_in_a_Two-Stage_Framework.html">244 acl-2013-Mining Opinion Words and Opinion Targets in a Two-Stage Framework</a></p>
<p>Author: Liheng Xu ; Kang Liu ; Siwei Lai ; Yubo Chen ; Jun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel two-stage method for mining opinion words and opinion targets. In the first stage, we propose a Sentiment Graph Walking algorithm, which naturally incorporates syntactic patterns in a Sentiment Graph to extract opinion word/target candidates. Then random walking is employed to estimate confidence of candidates, which improves extraction accuracy by considering confidence of patterns. In the second stage, we adopt a self-learning strategy to refine the results from the first stage, especially for filtering out high-frequency noise terms and capturing the long-tail terms, which are not investigated by previous methods. The experimental results on three real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared with stateof-the-art unsupervised methods.</p><p>5 0.18114413 <a title="67-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Exploring_Sentiment_in_Social_Media%3A_Bootstrapping_Subjectivity_Clues_from_Multilingual_Twitter_Streams.html">148 acl-2013-Exploring Sentiment in Social Media: Bootstrapping Subjectivity Clues from Multilingual Twitter Streams</a></p>
<p>Author: Svitlana Volkova ; Theresa Wilson ; David Yarowsky</p><p>Abstract: We study subjective language media and create Twitter-specific lexicons via bootstrapping sentiment-bearing terms from multilingual Twitter streams. Starting with a domain-independent, highprecision sentiment lexicon and a large pool of unlabeled data, we bootstrap Twitter-specific sentiment lexicons, using a small amount of labeled data to guide the process. Our experiments on English, Spanish and Russian show that the resulting lexicons are effective for sentiment classification for many underexplored languages in social media.</p><p>6 0.16736792 <a title="67-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Identifying_Opinion_Subgroups_in_Arabic_Online_Discussions.html">187 acl-2013-Identifying Opinion Subgroups in Arabic Online Discussions</a></p>

<p>Author: Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Ben King ; Mona Diab ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we use Arabic natural language processing techniques to analyze Arabic debates. The goal is to identify how the participants in a discussion split into subgroups with contrasting opinions. The members of each subgroup share the same opinion with respect to the discussion topic and an opposing opinion to the members of other subgroups. We use opinion mining techniques to identify opinion expressions and determine their polarities and their targets. We opinion predictions to represent the discussion in one of two formal representations: signed attitude network or a space of attitude vectors. We identify opinion subgroups by partitioning the signed network representation or by clustering the vector space representation. We evaluate the system using a data set of labeled discussions and show that it achieves good results.</p><p>3 0.7798081 <a title="67-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-An_annotated_corpus_of_quoted_opinions_in_news_articles.html">49 acl-2013-An annotated corpus of quoted opinions in news articles</a></p>
<p>Author: Tim O'Keefe ; James R. Curran ; Peter Ashwell ; Irena Koprinska</p><p>Abstract: Quotes are used in news articles as evidence of a personâ€™s opinion, and thus are a useful target for opinion mining. However, labelling each quote with a polarity score directed at a textually-anchored target can ignore the broader issue that the speaker is commenting on. We address this by instead labelling quotes as supporting or opposing a clear expression of a point of view on a topic, called a position statement. Using this we construct a corpus covering 7 topics with 2,228 quotes.</p><p>4 0.7348448 <a title="67-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Detecting_Turnarounds_in_Sentiment_Analysis%3A_Thwarting.html">117 acl-2013-Detecting Turnarounds in Sentiment Analysis: Thwarting</a></p>
<p>Author: Ankit Ramteke ; Akshat Malu ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya ; J. Saketha Nath</p><p>Abstract: Thwarting and sarcasm are two uncharted territories in sentiment analysis, the former because of the lack of training corpora and the latter because of the enormous amount of world knowledge it demands. In this paper, we propose a working definition of thwarting amenable to machine learning and create a system that detects if the document is thwarted or not. We focus on identifying thwarting in product reviews, especially in the camera domain. An ontology of the camera domain is created. Thwarting is looked upon as the phenomenon of polarity reversal at a higher level of ontology compared to the polarity expressed at the lower level. This notion of thwarting defined with respect to an ontology is novel, to the best of our knowledge. A rule based implementation building upon this idea forms our baseline. We show that machine learning with annotated corpora (thwarted/nonthwarted) is more effective than the rule based system. Because of the skewed distribution of thwarting, we adopt the Areaunder-the-Curve measure of performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at the difficult problem of thwarting detection, which we hope will at Akshat Malu Dept. of Computer Science & Engg., Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India. akshatmalu@ cse .i itb .ac .in J.

We show that our methodology, relying on a single annotation step and on simplified role definitions, outperforms the standard one both in terms of accuracy and time.</p><p>2 0.8825292 <a title="67-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-A_Learner_Corpus-based_Approach_to_Verb_Suggestion_for_ESL.html">8 acl-2013-A Learner Corpus-based Approach to Verb Suggestion for ESL</a></p>

The candidate sets are constructed from a large scale learner corpus to cover various error patterns made by learners. Furthermore, the model is trained using both a native corpus and the learner corpus via a domain adaptation technique. Experiments on two learner corpora show that the candidate sets increase the coverage of error patterns and domain adaptation improves the performance for verb suggestion.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.8736394 <a title="67-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Bi-directional_Inter-dependencies_of_Subjective_Expressions_and_Targets_and_their_Value_for_a_Joint_Model.html">67 acl-2013-Bi-directional Inter-dependencies of Subjective Expressions and Targets and their Value for a Joint Model</a></p>

But in the setting of monolingual alignment, previous work has not been able to align more than one sentence pair per second. We describe a discriminatively trained monolingual word aligner that uses a Conditional Random Field to globally decode the best alignment with features drawn from source and target sentences. Using just part-of-speech tags and WordNet as external resources, our aligner gives state-of-the-art result, while being an order-of-magnitude faster than the previous best performing system.</p><p>5 0.85551387 <a title="67-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Discriminative_Approach_to_Fill-in-the-Blank_Quiz_Generation_for_Language_Learners.html">122 acl-2013-Discriminative Approach to Fill-in-the-Blank Quiz Generation for Language Learners</a></p>
<p>Author: Keisuke Sakaguchi ; Yuki Arase ; Mamoru Komachi</p><p>Abstract: We propose discriminative methods to generate semantic distractors of fill-in-theblank quiz for language learners using a large-scale language learnersâ€™ corpus. Unlike previous studies, the proposed methods aim at satisfying both reliability and validity of generated distractors; distractors should be exclusive against answers to avoid multiple answers in one quiz, and distractors should discriminate learnersâ€™ proficiency. Detailed user evaluation with 3 native and 23 non-native speakers of English shows that our methods achieve better reliability and validity than previous methods.</p><p>6 0.85431039 <a title="67-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Implicatures_and_Nested_Beliefs_in_Approximate_Decentralized-POMDPs.html">190 acl-2013-Implicatures and Nested Beliefs in Approximate Decentralized-POMDPs</a></p>

</p><p>5 In this paper, we propose a method for discovering matches between problem reports and aid messages. [sent-9, score-0.648]
</p><p>6 Just after the disaster, many people used Twitter for posting problem reports and aid messages as it functioned while most communication channels suffered disruptions (Winn, 2011; Acar and Muraki, 2011; Sano et al. [sent-13, score-0.682]
</p><p>7 Examples of such problem reports and aid messages, translated from Japanese tweets, are given below (P1, A1). [sent-15, score-0.553]
</p><p>8 Such waste of resources could have been avoided if the organizations would have successfully shared the aid messages for the same problems. [sent-27, score-0.525]
</p><p>9 We developed methods for recognizing problem reports and aid messages in tweets and finding proper matches between them. [sent-29, score-0.916]
</p><p>10 We define problem reports, aid messages and their successful matches as follows. [sent-31, score-0.65]
</p><p>11 Problem-aid tweet match: A tweet pair is a problem-aid tweet match (1) if the aid message informs how to overcome the problem, (2) if the aid message informs about the set1619  ProceedingsS ooffita h,e B 5u1lgsta Arinan,u Aaulg Musete 4ti-n9g 2 o0f1 t3h. [sent-34, score-1.466]

</p><p>13 An underlying assumption of our method is that we can find a noun-predicate dependency relation that works as an indicator of problems and aids in problem reports and aid messages, which we refer to as problem nucleus and aid nucleus. [sent-43, score-1.276]
</p><p>14 1 An example of problem nucleus is “infant formula is sold out” in P1, and that of aid nucleus is “(can) buy infant formula” in A1. [sent-44, score-1.122]
</p><p>15 Many problem-aid tweet matches can be recognized through problem and aid nuclei pairs. [sent-45, score-1.082]
</p><p>16 We also assume that if the problem and aid nuclei match, they share the same noun. [sent-46, score-0.887]
</p><p>17 Then, the  semantics of predicates in the nuclei is the main factor that decides whether the nuclei constitute a match. [sent-47, score-0.898]
</p><p>18 We introduce a semantic classification of predicates according to the framework of excitation polarities proposed in Hashimoto et al. [sent-48, score-0.557]
</p><p>19 Our hypothesis is that excitation polarities along with trouble expressions can characterize problem reports, aid messages and their matches. [sent-50, score-1.39]
</p><p>20 , 2011) assuming that problem reports should include something ‘bad’ while aid messages describe something ‘good’ . [sent-54, score-0.654]
</p><p>21 1% of aid messages did not contain any problem report/aid message nuclei. [sent-61, score-0.678]
</p><p>22 The problem nuclei of FP1 and P1 are the same but FP1 is not a problem report because of the expression “I do not believe”. [sent-65, score-0.639]
</p><p>23 The aid nuclei of FA1 and A1 are the same but FA1 does not constitute a proper match with P1 because FA1 and P1 refer to different cities, “Iwaki” and “Sendai”. [sent-66, score-0.936]
</p><p>24 In this work, the problems concerning the modality and other semantic modifications to problem/aid nuclei by context are dealt with by the introduction of features representing the text surrounding the nuclei in machine learning. [sent-67, score-0.915]
</p><p>25 As for the location problem, we apply a location recognizer to all tweets and restrict the matching candidates to the  tweet pairs referring to the same location. [sent-68, score-0.547]
</p><p>26 We developed machine learning based systems to recognize problem reports, aid messages and problem-aid tweet matches. [sent-70, score-0.655]
</p><p>27 First, location names in tweets are identified by matching tweets against our location dictionary, described in Section 3. [sent-72, score-0.364]
</p><p>28 Then, each tweet is paired with each dependency relation in  the tweet, which is a candidate of problem/aid nuclei and given to the problem report and aid message recognizers. [sent-73, score-1.166]
</p><p>29 A tweet-nucleus-candidate pair judged as problem report is combined with another tweet-nucleus-candidate pair recognized as an aid message if the two nuclei share the same noun and the tweets share the same location name, and given to the problem-aid match recognizer. [sent-74, score-1.344]
</p><p>30 1620  In the following, problem and aid nuclei are denoted by a noun-template pair. [sent-75, score-0.887]
</p><p>31 For instance, “water supply stopped” in P2 is a problem nucleus, “water supply recovered” in A2 is an aid nucleus and they are denoted by the noun-template pairs ⟨water supply, X stopped⟩ and ⟨water supply, pXa recovered⟩ . [sent-77, score-0.782]
</p><p>32 The basic intuition behind this approach can be explained using excitation polarity proposed in Hashimoto et al. [sent-81, score-0.427]
</p><p>33 We observed that problem reports in general included either of (A) a dependency relation between a noun referring to some trouble and an excitatory template or (B) a dependency rela-  tion between a noun not referring to any trouble and an inhibitory template. [sent-90, score-1.008]
</p><p>34 As an interesting consequence of such a view on problem/aid nucleus, we can say the following regarding problem-aid tweet matchings: when a problem nucleus and an aid nucleus are an adequate match, the excitation polarities of their templates are opposite. [sent-104, score-1.667]
</p><p>35 “Bath is unusable” in P3 is a problem nucleus while “open the bath” in A3 is an aid nucleus. [sent-110, score-0.7]
</p><p>36 The polarity of the template in a problem nucleus should be excitatory like “flu is raging” while that of an aid nucleus should be inhibitory like ⟨flu, X was eradicated⟩ . [sent-115, score-1.24]
</p><p>37 Tshhoeuseld examples keep tikhee c⟨oflnu,st Xrai wnta sth eatra tdhiec problem and aid nucleus should have opposite polarities when they constitute a match. [sent-116, score-0.916]
</p><p>38 Note that the formulations of problem report, aid message and their matches or the excitation matrix (Table 1) were not presented to our annotators and our test/training data may contain data that contradict with the formulations. [sent-117, score-1.045]
</p><p>39 For instance, we assume that the problem nucleus and aid nucleus in a proper match share the same noun. [sent-120, score-1.026]
</p><p>40 However, tweet pairs such as “There are many injured people in Sendai city” and “We are sending ambulances to Sendai” can constitute a proper match, but there is no proper problem-aid nuclei pair that share the same noun in these tweets. [sent-121, score-0.733]
</p><p>41 3  Problem Report and Aid Message Recognizers  We recognize problem reports and aid messages in given tweets using a supervised classifier, SVMs with linear kernel, which worked best in our preliminary experiments. [sent-127, score-0.795]
</p><p>42 MSA is used to express the modality of nuclei and other contex-  tual information surrounding nuclei. [sent-130, score-0.459]
</p><p>43 REQ was introduced based on our observation that if there are some requests in tweets, problem nuclei tend to appear as justification for the requests. [sent-131, score-0.545]
</p><p>44 quently appearing in problem and aid nuclei, but since there was no improvement we omit them. [sent-133, score-0.454]
</p><p>45 Trouble Expressions (TR) As mentioned previously, trouble expressions work as good evidence for recognizing problem reports and aid messages. [sent-136, score-0.831]
</p><p>46 The TR feature indicates whether the noun in the problem/aid nucleus candidate is a trouble ex1622  pression or not. [sent-137, score-0.516]
</p><p>47 The value of the TR feature is determined by checking whether the nucleus noun is contained in the list. [sent-141, score-0.288]
</p><p>48 Excitation Polarities (EX) The excitation polarities are also important in recognizing problem reports and aid messages as mentioned before. [sent-142, score-1.211]
</p><p>49 For constructing the dictionary for excitation polarities of templates, we applied the bootstrapping proce-  dure in Hashimoto et al. [sent-143, score-0.557]
</p><p>50 Hashimoto’s method provides the value of the excitation score in [−1, 1] for each template indicating tiohen polarities a−n1d, 1th]e fior strength. [sent-145, score-0.615]
</p><p>51 We used the excitation score values as feature values. [sent-150, score-0.373]
</p><p>52 3 Geographical Locations (GL) Our location recognizer matches tweets against our location dictionary. [sent-171, score-0.509]
</p><p>53 4  Problem-Aid Match Recognizer  After problem report and aid message recognition, the positive outputs of the respective classifiers are used as input in this step. [sent-176, score-0.633]
</p><p>54 The problemaid match recognizer classifies an aid messagenucleus pair together with the problem report-  nucleus pair employing SVMs with linear kernel, which performed best in this task again. [sent-177, score-0.968]
</p><p>55 Here also we attempted to capture typical or frequent matches of nuclei using template and noun IDs and their combinations, but we did not observe any improvement so we omit them from the feature set. [sent-179, score-0.628]
</p><p>56 html 1623  As for TR and EX, our intuition is that if a prob-  lem nucleus and an aid nucleus are an adequate match, their excitation polarities are opposite, as described in Section 2. [sent-189, score-1.44]
</p><p>57 We encode whether the excitation polarities of nuclei templates are the same or not in our features. [sent-190, score-1.054]
</p><p>58 Also, the excitation polarities of problem and aid nuclei and TR are combined (TREX1, TREX2) so that the classifier can know whether the nuclei follow the constraint for adequate matches described in Section 2. [sent-191, score-1.972]
</p><p>59 As for SIM, if an aid message matches a problem report, besides the common nucleus noun, it is reasonable to assume that certain contexts are semantically similar. [sent-192, score-0.918]
</p><p>60 SIM1 looks for common semantic word classes in the problem report and aid message. [sent-194, score-0.51]
</p><p>61 SIM2 and SIM3 target the modifiers of the common nucleus noun if they exist. [sent-195, score-0.288]
</p><p>62 We also observed that if an aid message matches a problem report, the problem nucleus template and aid nucleus template are often distributionally similar. [sent-196, score-1.734]
</p><p>63 5 CTP indicates whether the problem and aid nuclei are in contradiction relation or not. [sent-201, score-0.943]
</p><p>64 This feature was implemented based on the observation that when problem and aid nuclei are in contradiction relation, they are often proper matches (e. [sent-202, score-1.064]
</p><p>65 5  Experiments  We evaluated our problem report recognizer and problem-aid match recognizer. [sent-208, score-0.364]
</p><p>66 For the sake of space, we give only the performance figures of the aid message recognizer at the end of Section 5. [sent-209, score-0.705]
</p><p>67 Particularly, we assessed the effect of excitation polarities and trouble expressions in two settings. [sent-220, score-0.835]
</p><p>68 The second targets problem reports with problem nuclei unseen in the training data. [sent-222, score-0.698]
</p><p>69 In both experiments we observed that the performance drops when excitation polarities and trouble expressions are removed from the feature set. [sent-223, score-0.835]
</p><p>70 The performance drop was larger in the second experiment which suggests that the excitation polarities and trouble expressions are more effective against unseen problem reports. [sent-224, score-0.938]
</p><p>71 Our problem report recognizer and its variants are listed in Table 3. [sent-230, score-0.31]
</p><p>72 Especially note the performance drop if we remove excitation polarities (EX), trouble expression (TR) and both excitation and trouble expression features (TR&EX;), confirming that they are crucial in recognizing problem reports with high accuracy. [sent-249, score-1.596]
</p><p>73 The rule-based method achieved relatively high precision despite of the low recall, demonstrating the importance of problem and aid nuclei formulations described in Section 1. [sent-252, score-0.915]
</p><p>74 The second experiment assessed the efficiency of our problem report recognizer against unseen problem nuclei under the condition that every template in nuclei has excitation polarity. [sent-253, score-1.71]
</p><p>75 We sampled the training and test data so that the problem nucleus nouns and templates in the training and test data are disjoint. [sent-254, score-0.399]
</p><p>76 First we created a subset of the test data by selecting the samples which had nuclei with excitation templates. [sent-255, score-0.806]
</p><p>77 Next, we removed samples from training data R if either of their problem nouns or templates appeared in the nuclei of T′. [sent-257, score-0.586]
</p><p>78 We trained our problem report recognizer using R′ and tested its performance using T′. [sent-259, score-0.31]
</p><p>79 The effectiveness of excitation polarities and trouble expressions was more evident in this setting. [sent-261, score-0.835]
</p><p>80 more that 80% precision), than the previous setting, showing that excitation templates and trouble expressions are crucial in achieving high perfor-  mance especially for unseen problem nuclei. [sent-270, score-0.818]
</p><p>81 The same was confirmed when we removed excitation polarity and trouble expression related features, with performance dropping by 7. [sent-271, score-0.679]
</p><p>82 This implies, assuming that we have a wide-coverage dictionary of templates with excitation polarities, that excitation polarities are important in dealing with unexpected problems in disaster situations. [sent-275, score-1.138]
</p><p>83 67% precision and showed similar tendencies with the problem report recognizer, with the excitation polarities and trouble expressions contributing to higher accuracy. [sent-281, score-0.982]
</p><p>84 We can conclude that excitation polarities and trouble expressions are important in identifying problem reports and aid messages during disaster  situations. [sent-282, score-1.61]
</p><p>85 We applied our problem report recognizer and aid message recognizer to all 55 million tweets and combined the tweet-nucleus pairs judged as problem reports and aid messages, respectively, to create the training and test data. [sent-285, score-1.75]
</p><p>86 M1 includes many variations of the aid messages for each problem report, while M2 en1625  sures diversity in nouns and templates in problem nuclei. [sent-287, score-0.708]
</p><p>87 For M1, we randomly picked up problem reports from the output of the problem report recognizer and to each we attached up to 30 randomly picked, distinct aid messages that have the same nucleus noun. [sent-288, score-1.21]
</p><p>88 Building M2 follows the construction method of M1, except that: (1) we used up to 30 distinct problem nuclei for each noun; (2) for each problem report we attached only one ran-  domly picked aid message. [sent-289, score-1.006]
</p><p>89 As the final experiments, we evaluated topranking matches of our problem-aid match recognizer, where the recognizer classified all the possible combinations of tweet-nuclei pairs taken from 55 million tweets. [sent-300, score-0.381]
</p><p>90 did not use excitation polarities and trouble expressions in its feature set. [sent-307, score-0.835]
</p><p>91 Note that PROPOSEDTR&EX; was fed by the problem report and aid message recognizers that didn’t use excitation polarities and trouble expressions. [sent-308, score-1.476]
</p><p>92 For both systems’ training data we used R for the problem report and aid message recognizers; M1 and M2 for the problem-aid matching recognizers. [sent-309, score-0.633]
</p><p>93 10Note that this setting is a pessimistic estimation of our system’s overall performance, since according to our observations problem reports with very frequent nucleus nouns had proper matches with a higher accuracy than problem reports with less frequent nucleus nouns. [sent-318, score-0.963]
</p><p>94 Problem report and aid message nuclei are boldfaced in the English translations. [sent-320, score-1.003]
</p><p>95 For ‘unseen’, first we removed the samples from the systems’ outputs if either the nucleus noun or template pair appear in the nuclei of the problem-aid match recognizers’ training  data. [sent-324, score-0.833]
</p><p>96 In both scenarios we can confirm that excitation polarity and trouble expression related features contribute to this task. [sent-330, score-0.679]
</p><p>97 ; For unseen problem/aid nuclei PROPOSED method’s average precision of 58. [sent-334, score-0.501]

</p><p>99 7  Conclusions  In this paper, we proposed a method to discover matches between problem reports and aid messages from tweets in large-scale disasters. [sent-363, score-0.89]
</p><p>100 Through a series of experiments, we demonstrated that the performance of the problem-aid matching can be improved with the usage of semantic orientation of excitation polarities, proposed in (Hashimoto et al. [sent-364, score-0.373]

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses both intra- and inter-sentential causal relations for why-QA. We also propose a method for assessing the appropriateness of causal relations as answers to a given question using the semantic orientation of excitation proposed by Hashimoto et al. (2012). By applying these ideas to Japanese why-QA, we improved precision by 4.4% against all the questions in our test set over the current state-of-theart system for Japanese why-QA. In addi- tion, unlike the state-of-the-art system, our system could achieve very high precision (83.2%) for 25% of all the questions in the test set by restricting its output to the confident answers only.</p><p>3 0.13375397 <a title="42-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Detecting_Event-Related_Links_and_Sentiments_from_Social_Media_Texts.html">115 acl-2013-Detecting Event-Related Links and Sentiments from Social Media Texts</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexandra Balahur ; Hristo Tanev</p><p>Abstract: Nowadays, the importance of Social Media is constantly growing, as people often use such platforms to share mainstream media news and comment on the events that they relate to. As such, people no loger remain mere spectators to the events that happen in the world, but become part of them, commenting on their developments and the entities involved, sharing their opinions and distributing related content. This paper describes a system that links the main events detected from clusters of newspaper articles to tweets related to them, detects complementary information sources from the links they contain and subsequently applies sentiment analysis to classify them into positive, negative and neutral.

<p>Author: Weiwei Guo ; Hao Li ; Heng Ji ; Mona Diab</p><p>Abstract: Many current Natural Language Processing [NLP] techniques work well assuming a large context of text as input data. However they become ineffective when applied to short texts such as Twitter feeds. To overcome the issue, we want to find a related newswire document to a given tweet to provide contextual support for NLP tasks. This requires robust modeling and understanding of the semantics of short texts. The contribution of the paper is two-fold: 1. we introduce the Linking-Tweets-toNews task as well as a dataset of linked tweet-news pairs, which can benefit many NLP applications; 2. in contrast to previ- ous research which focuses on lexical features within the short texts (text-to-word information), we propose a graph based latent variable model that models the inter short text correlations (text-to-text information). This is motivated by the observation that a tweet usually only covers one aspect of an event. We show that using tweet specific feature (hashtag) and news specific feature (named entities) as well as temporal constraints, we are able to extract text-to-text correlations, and thus completes the semantic picture of a short text. Our experiments show significant improvement of our new model over baselines with three evaluation metrics in the new task.</p><p>5 0.10171247 <a title="42-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Microblogs_as_Parallel_Corpora.html">240 acl-2013-Microblogs as Parallel Corpora</a></p>
<p>Author: Wang Ling ; Guang Xiang ; Chris Dyer ; Alan Black ; Isabel Trancoso</p><p>Abstract: In the ever-expanding sea of microblog data, there is a surprising amount of naturally occurring parallel text: some users create post multilingual messages targeting international audiences while others “retweet” translations. We present an efficient method for detecting these messages and extracting parallel segments from them. We have been able to extract over 1M Chinese-English parallel segments from Sina Weibo (the Chinese counterpart of Twitter) using only their public APIs. As a supplement to existing parallel training data, our automatically extracted parallel data yields substantial translation quality improvements in translating microblog text and modest improvements in translating edited news commentary.

<p>Author: Alexandra Balahur ; Hristo Tanev</p><p>Abstract: Nowadays, the importance of Social Media is constantly growing, as people often use such platforms to share mainstream media news and comment on the events that they relate to. As such, people no loger remain mere spectators to the events that happen in the world, but become part of them, commenting on their developments and the entities involved, sharing their opinions and distributing related content. This paper describes a system that links the main events detected from clusters of newspaper articles to tweets related to them, detects complementary information sources from the links they contain and subsequently applies sentiment analysis to classify them into positive, negative and neutral. In this manner, readers can follow the main events happening in the world, both from the perspective of mainstream as well as social media and the public’s perception on them. This system will be part of the EMM media monitoring framework working live and it will be demonstrated using Google Earth.</p><p>3 0.70261312 <a title="42-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-An_Empirical_Study_on_Uncertainty_Identification_in_Social_Media_Context.html">45 acl-2013-An Empirical Study on Uncertainty Identification in Social Media Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongyu Wei ; Junwen Chen ; Wei Gao ; Binyang Li ; Lanjun Zhou ; Yulan He ; Kam-Fai Wong</p><p>Abstract: Uncertainty text detection is important to many social-media-based applications since more and more users utilize social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, etc.) as information source to produce or derive interpretations based on them. However, existing uncertainty cues are ineffective in social media context because of its specific characteristics. In this paper, we propose a variant of annotation scheme for uncertainty identification and construct the first uncertainty corpus based on tweets. We then conduct experiments on the generated tweets corpus to study the effectiveness of different types of features for uncertainty text identification.</p><p>4 0.64162874 <a title="42-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Exploiting_Social_Media_for_Natural_Language_Processing%3A_Bridging_the_Gap_between_Language-centric_and_Real-world_Applications.html">146 acl-2013-Exploiting Social Media for Natural Language Processing: Bridging the Gap between Language-centric and Real-world Applications</a></p>

<p>Author: Aline Villavicencio ; Marco Idiart ; Robert Berwick ; Igor Malioutov</p><p>Abstract: Hierarchical Bayesian Models (HBMs) have been used with some success to capture empirically observed patterns of under- and overgeneralization in child language acquisition. However, as is well known, HBMs are “ideal”learningsystems, assumingaccess to unlimited computational resources that may not be available to child language learners. Consequently, it remains crucial to carefully assess the use of HBMs along with alternative, possibly simpler, candidate models. This paper presents such an evaluation for a language acquisi- tion domain where explicit HBMs have been proposed: the acquisition of English dative constructions. In particular, we present a detailed, empiricallygrounded model-selection comparison of HBMs vs. a simpler alternative based on clustering along with maximum likelihood estimation that we call linear competition learning (LCL). Our results demonstrate that LCL can match HBM model performance without incurring on the high computational costs associated with HBMs.</p><p>3 0.52884132 <a title="42-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-A_Tightly-coupled_Unsupervised_Clustering_and_Bilingual_Alignment_Model_for_Transliteration.html">25 acl-2013-A Tightly-coupled Unsupervised Clustering and Bilingual Alignment Model for Transliteration</a></p>
<p>Author: Tingting Li ; Tiejun Zhao ; Andrew Finch ; Chunyue Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Machine Transliteration is an essential task for many NLP applications. However, names and loan words typically originate from various languages, obey different transliteration rules, and therefore may benefit from being modeled independently. Recently, transliteration models based on Bayesian learning have overcome issues with over-fitting allowing for many-to-many alignment in the training of transliteration models. We propose a novel coupled Dirichlet process mixture model (cDPMM) that simultaneously clusters and bilingually aligns transliteration data within a single unified model. The unified model decomposes into two classes of non-parametric Bayesian component models: a Dirichlet process mixture model for clustering, and a set of multinomial Dirichlet process models that perform bilingual alignment independently for each cluster. The experimental results show that our method considerably outperforms conventional alignment models.</p><p>4 0.47384852 <a title="42-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Why-Question_Answering_using_Intra-_and_Inter-Sentential_Causal_Relations.html">387 acl-2013-Why-Question Answering using Intra- and Inter-Sentential Causal Relations</a></p>
<p>Author: Jong-Hoon Oh ; Kentaro Torisawa ; Chikara Hashimoto ; Motoki Sano ; Stijn De Saeger ; Kiyonori Ohtake</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore the utility of intra- and inter-sentential causal relations between terms or clauses as evidence for answering why-questions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses both intra- and inter-sentential causal relations for why-QA. We also propose a method for assessing the appropriateness of causal relations as answers to a given question using the semantic orientation of excitation proposed by Hashimoto et al. (2012). By applying these ideas to Japanese why-QA, we improved precision by 4.4% against all the questions in our test set over the current state-of-theart system for Japanese why-QA. In addi- tion, unlike the state-of-the-art system, our system could achieve very high precision (83.2%) for 25% of all the questions in the test set by restricting its output to the confident answers only.</p><p>5 0.40200669 <a title="42-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Outsourcing_FrameNet_to_the_Crowd.html">265 acl-2013-Outsourcing FrameNet to the Crowd</a></p>

We compare two approaches: the first one is the standard annotation methodology of lexical units and frame elements in two steps, while the second is a novel approach aimed at acquiring frames in a bottom-up fashion, starting from frame element annotation. We show that our methodology, relying on a single annotation step and on simplified role definitions, outperforms the standard one both in terms of accuracy and time.</p><p>6 0.39857829 <a title="42-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Improving_pairwise_coreference_models_through_feature_space_hierarchy_learning.html">196 acl-2013-Improving pairwise coreference models through feature space hierarchy learning</a></p>

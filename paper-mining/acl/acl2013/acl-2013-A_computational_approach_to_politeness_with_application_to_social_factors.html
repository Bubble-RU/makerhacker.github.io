<p>Author: Brendan O'Connor ; Brandon M. Stewart ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We describe a new probabilistic model for extracting events between major political actors from news corpora. Our unsupervised model brings together familiar components in natural language processing (like parsers and topic models) with contextual political information— temporal and dyad dependence—to infer latent event classes. We quantitatively evaluate the model’s performance on political science benchmarks: recovering expert-assigned event class valences, and detecting real-world conflict. We also conduct a small case study based on our model’s inferences. A supplementary appendix, and replication software/data are available online, at: http://brenocon.com/irevents</p><p>3 0.20100063 <a title="30-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-A_user-centric_model_of_voting_intention_from_Social_Media.html">33 acl-2013-A user-centric model of voting intention from Social Media</a></p>
<p>Author: Vasileios Lampos ; Daniel PreoÅ£iuc-Pietro ; Trevor Cohn</p><p>Abstract: Social Media contain a multitude of user opinions which can be used to predict realworld phenomena in many domains including politics, finance and health. Most existing methods treat these problems as linear regression, learning to relate word frequencies and other simple features to a known response variable (e.g., voting intention polls or financial indicators). These techniques require very careful filtering of the input texts, as most Social Media posts are irrelevant to the task. In this paper, we present a novel approach which performs high quality filtering automatically, through modelling not just words but also users, framed as a bilinear model with a sparse regulariser. We also consider the problem of modelling groups of related output variables, using a structured multi-task regularisation method. Our experiments on voting intention prediction demonstrate strong performance over large-scale input from Twitter on two distinct case studies, outperforming competitive baselines.</p><p>4 0.14072675 <a title="30-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Public_Dialogue%3A_Analysis_of_Tolerance_in_Online_Discussions.html">287 acl-2013-Public Dialogue: Analysis of Tolerance in Online Discussions</a></p>
<p>Author: Arjun Mukherjee ; Vivek Venkataraman ; Bing Liu ; Sharon Meraz</p><p>Abstract: Social media platforms have enabled people to freely express their views and discuss issues of interest with others. While it is important to discover the topics in discussions, it is equally useful to mine the nature of such discussions or debates and the behavior of the participants. There are many questions that can be asked. One key question is whether the participants give reasoned arguments with justifiable claims via constructive debates or exhibit dogmatism and egotistic clashes of ideologies. The central idea of this question is tolerance, which is a key concept in the field of communications. In this work, we perform a computational study of tolerance in the context of online discussions. We aim to identify tolerant vs. intolerant participants and investigate how disagreement affects tolerance in discussions in a quantitative framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such study. Our experiments using real-life discussions demonstrate the effective- ness of the proposed technique and also provide some key insights into the psycholinguistic phenomenon of tolerance in online discussions.</p><p>5 0.11364456 <a title="30-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Discovering_User_Interactions_in_Ideological_Discussions.html">121 acl-2013-Discovering User Interactions in Ideological Discussions</a></p>
<p>Author: Arjun Mukherjee ; Bing Liu</p><p>Abstract: Online discussion forums are a popular platform for people to voice their opinions on any subject matter and to discuss or debate any issue of interest. In forums where users discuss social, political, or religious issues, there are often heated debates among users or participants. Existing research has studied mining of user stances or camps on certain issues, opposing perspectives, and contention points. In this paper, we focus on identifying the nature of interactions among user pairs. The central questions are: How does each pair of users interact with each other? Does the pair of users mostly agree or disagree? What is the lexicon that people often use to express agreement and disagreement? We present a topic model based approach to answer these questions. Since agreement and disagreement expressions are usually multiword phrases, we propose to employ a ranking method to identify highly relevant phrases prior to topic modeling. After modeling, we use the modeling results to classify the nature of interaction of each user pair. Our evaluation results using real-life discussion/debate posts demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.</p><p>6 0.086485833 <a title="30-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Detecting_Chronic_Critics_Based_on_Sentiment_Polarity_and_User%C3%A2%E2%80%A2%C5%BDs_Behavior_in_Social_Media.html">114 acl-2013-Detecting Chronic Critics Based on Sentiment Polarity and Userâ•Žs Behavior in Social Media</a></p>

<p>Author: Kazi Saidul Hasan ; Vincent Ng</p><p>Abstract: Determining the stance expressed by an author from a post written for a twosided debate in an online debate forum is a relatively new problem. We seek to improve Anand et al.’s (201 1) approach to debate stance classification by modeling two types of soft extra-linguistic constraints on the stance labels of debate posts, user-interaction constraints and ideology constraints. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of these inter-post constraints in improving debate stance classification.</p><p>4 0.59556001 <a title="30-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Discovering_User_Interactions_in_Ideological_Discussions.html">121 acl-2013-Discovering User Interactions in Ideological Discussions</a></p>

<p>Author: Mohamed Aly ; Amir Atiya</p><p>Abstract: We introduce LABR, the largest sentiment analysis dataset to-date for the Arabic language. It consists of over 63,000 book reviews, each rated on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. We investigate the properties of the the dataset, and present its statistics. We explore using the dataset for two tasks: sentiment polarity classification and rating classification. We provide standard splits of the dataset into training and testing, for both polarity and rating classification, in both balanced and unbalanced settings. We run baseline experiments on the dataset to establish a benchmark.</p><p>3 0.63403994 <a title="30-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-WebAnno%3A_A_Flexible%2C_Web-based_and_Visually_Supported_System_for_Distributed_Annotations.html">385 acl-2013-WebAnno: A Flexible, Web-based and Visually Supported System for Distributed Annotations</a></p>
<p>Author: Seid Muhie Yimam ; Iryna Gurevych ; Richard Eckart de Castilho ; Chris Biemann</p><p>Abstract: We present WebAnno, a general purpose web-based annotation tool for a wide range of linguistic annotations. WebAnno offers annotation project management, freely configurable tagsets and the management of users in different roles. WebAnno uses modern web technology for visualizing and editing annotations in a web browser. It supports arbitrarily large documents, pluggable import/export filters, the curation of annotations across various users, and an interface to farming out annotations to a crowdsourcing platform. Currently WebAnno allows part-ofspeech, named entity, dependency parsing and co-reference chain annotations. The architecture design allows adding additional modes of visualization and editing, when new kinds of annotations are to be supported.</p><p>4 0.63283545 <a title="30-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-QuEst_-_A_translation_quality_estimation_framework.html">289 acl-2013-QuEst - A translation quality estimation framework</a></p>
<p>Author: Lucia Specia ; ; ; Kashif Shah ; Jose G.C. de Souza ; Trevor Cohn</p><p>Abstract: We describe QUEST, an open source framework for machine translation quality estimation. The framework allows the extraction of several quality indicators from source segments, their translations, external resources (corpora, language models, topic models, etc.), as well as language tools (parsers, part-of-speech tags, etc.). It also provides machine learning algorithms to build quality estimation models. We benchmark the framework on a number of datasets and discuss the efficacy of features and algorithms.</p><p>5 0.63148773 <a title="30-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Learning_to_Extract_International_Relations_from_Political_Context.html">224 acl-2013-Learning to Extract International Relations from Political Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Brendan O'Connor ; Brandon M. Stewart ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We describe a new probabilistic model for extracting events between major political actors from news corpora. Our unsupervised model brings together familiar components in natural language processing (like parsers and topic models) with contextual political information— temporal and dyad dependence—to infer latent event classes. We quantitatively evaluate the model’s performance on political science benchmarks: recovering expert-assigned event class valences, and detecting real-world conflict. We also conduct a small case study based on our model’s inferences.

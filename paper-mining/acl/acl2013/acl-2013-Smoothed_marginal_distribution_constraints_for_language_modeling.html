</p><p>2 Abstract We present an algorithm for re-estimating parameters of backoff n-gram language models so as to preserve given marginal distributions, along the lines of wellknown Kneser-Ney (1995) smoothing. [sent-4, score-0.457]
</p><p>3 Unlike Kneser-Ney, our approach is designed to be applied to any given smoothed backoff model, including models that have already been heavily pruned. [sent-5, score-0.642]
</p><p>4 We present experimental results for heavily pruned backoff ngram models, and demonstrate perplexity and word error rate reductions when used with various baseline smoothing methods. [sent-9, score-1.032]
</p><p>5 Such models are trained on large text corpora, by counting the frequency of n-gram collocations, then normalizing and smoothing (regularizing) the resulting multinomial distributions. [sent-12, score-0.275]
</p><p>6 Standard techniques store the observed n-grams and derive probabilities ofunobserved n-grams via their longest observed suffix and “backoff” costs associated with the prefix histories of the unobserved suffixes. [sent-13, score-0.543]
</p><p>7 Another common approach which we pursue in this paper is model pruning, whereby some number of the n-grams are removed from explicit storage in the model, so that their probability must be as–  –  –  –  signed via backoff smoothing. [sent-22, score-0.382]
</p><p>8 While these greedy pruning methods are highly effective for models estimated with most common smoothing approaches, they have been shown to be far less effective with Kneser-Ney trained language models (Siivola et al. [sent-27, score-0.413]
</p><p>9 , 2010), leading to severe degradation in model quality relative to other standard smoothing meth43  Proce dinSgosfi oa,f tB huel 5g1arsita, An Anu gauls Mt 4e-e9ti n2g01 o3f. [sent-29, score-0.307]

</p><p>11 4-gram language models, pruned using Stolcke (1998) relative entropy pruning to  approximately 1. [sent-42, score-0.416]
</p><p>12 Thus, while Kneser-Ney may be the preferred smoothing method for large, unpruned models where it can achieve real improvements over other smoothing methods when relatively sparse, pruned models are required, it has severely diminished utility. [sent-45, score-0.673]
</p><p>13 In their experiments (see Table 1 caption for specifics on training/test setup), they trained 4-gram Broadcast News language models using a variety of both backoff and interpolated smoothing methods and measured perplexity before and after Stolcke (1998) relative entropy based pruning. [sent-48, score-0.708]
</p><p>14 With this size training data, the perplexity of all of the smoothing methods other than Kneser-Ney degrades from around 120 with the full model to around 200 with the heavily pruned model. [sent-49, score-0.635]
</p><p>15 Kneser-Ney smoothed models have lower perplexity with the full model than the other methods by about 5 points, but degrade with pruning to far higher perplexity, between 270-285. [sent-50, score-0.726]
</p><p>16 –  –  The cause of this degradation is Kneser-Ney’s unique method for estimating smoothed language models, which will be presented in more detail in Section 3. [sent-51, score-0.331]
</p><p>17 Briefly, the smoothing method reestimates lower-order n-gram parameters in order to avoid over-estimating the likelihood of n-grams that already have ample probability mass allocated as part of higher-order n-grams. [sent-52, score-0.325]
</p><p>18 This is done via a marginal distribution constraint which requires the expected frequency of the lower-order n-grams to match their observed frequency in the training data, much as is commonly done for maximum entropy model training. [sent-53, score-0.403]
</p><p>19 Lower-order n-gram parameters resulting from Kneser-Ney are not relative frequency estimates, as with other smoothing methods; rather they are parameters estimated specifically for use within the larger smoothed model. [sent-55, score-0.558]
</p><p>20 First, the pruning methods commonly use lower order n-gram probabilities to derive an estimate  of state marginals, and, since these parameters are no longer smoothed relative frequency estimates, they do not serve that purpose well. [sent-57, score-0.76]
</p><p>21 For this reason, the widely-used SRILM toolkit recently provided switches to modify their pruning algorithm to use another model for state marginal estimates (Stolcke et al. [sent-58, score-0.529]
</p><p>22 Second, and perhaps more importantly, the marginal constraints that were applied prior to smoothing will not in general be consistent with the much smaller pruned model. [sent-60, score-0.563]
</p><p>23 In this paper, we present an algorithm that imposes marginal distribution constraints of the sort used in Kneser-Ney modeling on arbitrary smoothed backoff n-gram language models. [sent-63, score-0.815]
</p><p>24 Our approach makes use of the same sort of deriva-  tion as the original Kneser-Ney modeling, but, among other differences, relies on smoothed estimates of the empirical relative frequency rather than the unsmoothed observed frequency. [sent-64, score-0.543]
</p><p>25 The algorithm can be applied after the smoothed model has been pruned, hence avoiding the pitfalls associated with Kneser-Ney modeling. [sent-65, score-0.348]
</p><p>26 Furthermore, while Kneser-Ney is conventionally defined as a variant of absolute discounting, our method can be applied to models smoothed with any backoff smoothing, including mixtures of models, widely 44  used for domain adaptation. [sent-66, score-0.611]
</p><p>27 We next establish formal preliminaries and our smoothed marginal distribution constraints method. [sent-67, score-0.52]
</p><p>28 2  Preliminaries  N-gram language models are typically presented mathematically in terms of words w, the strings (histories) h that precede them, and the suffixes of the histories (backoffs) h0 that are used in the  smoothing recursion. [sent-68, score-0.395]

</p><p>30 w|w| we can calculate the smoothed conditional probability of each word wi in the sequence given the k words that preceded it, depending on the order of the Markov model. [sent-78, score-0.4]
</p><p>31 Then the smoothed model is defined recursively as follows:  P(wi| hik)  = ? [sent-83, score-0.303]
</p><p>32 Note that for h = hik, the typically defined backoff history h0 = hik−1, i. [sent-88, score-0.38]
</p><p>33 βα((hhikik,whi)ik−1) P(wi|hik−1)if o hthikweriw∈is Ge  (1)  where β(hikwi) is the parameter associated with the n-gram hikwi and α(hik, is the backoff cost associated with going from state hik to state We assume that, if hw ∈ G then all prefixes and s. [sent-100, score-0.958]
</p><p>34 States represent histories h, and the words w, whose probabilities are conditioned on h, label the arcs, leading to the history state for the subsequent word. [sent-104, score-0.507]
</p><p>35 , ‘xyz’ indicates that the state represents a history with the previous three  hik−1)  hik−1. [sent-107, score-0.265]
</p><p>36 Failure arcs, labeled with a φ in Figure 1, encode an “otherwise” semantics and have as destination the origin state’s backoff history. [sent-109, score-0.263]
</p><p>37 Note that, in general, the recursive definition of backoff may require the traversal of several back-  presented for convenience, to specify the history implicitly encoded by the state. [sent-111, score-0.38]
</p><p>38 , the highest order states in Figure 1 needing to traverse a couple of φ arcs to reach state ‘z’ . [sent-114, score-0.375]
</p><p>39 We can define the backoff cost between a state hik and any of its suffix states as follows. [sent-115, score-0.831]
</p><p>40 3  Marginal distribution constraints  (2)  Marginal distribution constraints attempt to match the expected frequency of an n-gram with its observed frequency. [sent-124, score-0.308]
</p><p>41 Using standard n-gram notation (where g0 is the backoff history for g), this constraint is stated in Kneser and Ney (1995) as  bP(w  | h0) =  X  P(g,w | h0)  (3)  g:gX0 X=h0  Pb  where is the empirical relative frequency estimate. [sent-127, score-0.505]
</p><p>42 First,  we will make use of regularized estimates of relative frequency P rather than raw relative frequency Pb. [sent-132, score-0.289]
</p><p>43 Second, rather than just looking at observed hbistories h that back off to h0, we will look at ball histories (observed or not) of the length of the longest history in the model. [sent-133, score-0.447]
</p><p>44 For notational simplicity, suppose we have an n+1-gram model, hence the longest history in the model is of length n. [sent-134, score-0.288]
</p><p>45 Assume the length of the particular backoff history |h0 | = k. [sent-135, score-0.38]
</p><p>46 Then we can restate thhe ∈ marginal distribution constraint in equation 3 as  P(w | h0) =h∈VXn−kh0P(h,w | h0)  (4)  Next we solve for β(h0w) parameters used in equation 1. [sent-138, score-0.395]
</p><p>47 Keep in mind, P is the target expected frequency from a given smoothed model. [sent-145, score-0.341]
</p><p>48 This means that we cannot simply ‘repair’ pruned Kneser-Ney models, but must use other smoothing methods where the smoothed values are based on relative frequency estimation. [sent-147, score-0.795]
</p><p>49 There are, in addition, two other important differences in our approach from that in Kneser and Ney (1995), which would remain as differences even if our target expected frequency were the unsmoothed relative frequency Pb instead of the smoothed estimate P. [sent-148, score-0.5]
</p><p>50 First, theb sum in the numerator is over histories of lengtbh n, the highest order in the n-gram model, whereas in the KneserNey approach the sum is over histories that immediately back off to h0, i. [sent-149, score-0.486]
</p><p>51 We briefly note that, like Kneser-Ney, if the baseline smoothing method is consistent, then the amount of smoothing in the limit will go to zero and our resulting model will also be consistent. [sent-159, score-0.397]
</p><p>52 8 are given values (from the input smoothed model and previous stages in the algorithm, respectively), implying an algorithm that estimates highest orders of the model first. [sent-161, score-0.373]
</p><p>53 In addition, steady state history probabilities P(h) must be calculated. [sent-162, score-0.493]
</p><p>54 4  Model constraint algorithm  Our algorithm takes a smoothed backoff n-gram language model in an automaton format (see Figure 1) and returns a smoothed backoff n-gram lan-  guage model with the same topology. [sent-164, score-1.249]
</p><p>55 , that are backed-off to we calculate the weight provided by equation 8 and assign it (after normalization) to the appropriate n-gram arc in the automaton. [sent-167, score-0.267]
</p><p>56 First, we must provide a probability for every state in the model. [sent-169, score-0.265]
</p><p>57 1 Steady state probability calculation The steady state probability P(h) is taken to be the probability of observing h after a long word sequence, i. [sent-173, score-0.651]

</p><p>61 The backoff arcs have a special interpretation in the automaton: they are traversed only if a word fails to match at the higher order. [sent-201, score-0.4]
</p><p>62 These failure arcs must be properly handled before applying standard stationary distribution calculations. [sent-202, score-0.34]
</p><p>63 A simple approach would be for each word w0 and state h such that hw0 ∈/ G, but h0w0 ∈ G, add a w0 arc from state h to ∈h0 Gw0, w buitth h weight α(h, h0)β(h0w0)  and then remove all failure arcs (see Figure 2a). [sent-203, score-0.62]
</p><p>64 This however results in an automaton with |V | arcs leaving every state, swinhiacnh aius unwieldy iwthith|V larger vocabularies and n-gram orders. [sent-204, score-0.281]
</p><p>65 Instead, for each word w and state h such that hw ∈ G, add a w arc wfroormd sw ta taen hd sttoa the0 wh swucithh weight −α(h, h0)β(h0w) and then replace awll wfaiiltuhre w leaibgehlts − −wαit(hh ? [sent-205, score-0.351]
</p><p>66 In this case, the added negativelyweighted arcs compensate for the excess probability mass allowed by the epsilon arcs3. [sent-207, score-0.271]
</p><p>67 2 Accumulation of higher order values We are summing over all possible histories of length n in equation 8, and the steady state probability calculation outlined in the previous section includes the probability mass for histories h ∈ G. [sent-210, score-0.984]
</p><p>68 ing allocated to the state representing their longest suffix that is explicitly in G. [sent-212, score-0.382]
</p><p>69 That is the state that would be active when these histories are encountered. [sent-213, score-0.337]
</p><p>70 Hence, once we have calculated the steady  state probabilities for each state in the smoothed model, we only need to sum over states explicitly in the model. [sent-214, score-0.84]
</p><p>71 Figure 2: Schemata showing failure arc handling: (a) φ removal: add w0 arc (red), delete φ arc; (b) φ replacement: add w arc (red), replace φ by ? [sent-216, score-0.461]
</p><p>72 Since we assume that, for every ngram hw ∈ G, every prefix and suffix is also ignr Gm, we k ∈no wG th evate iyf phr0ewfi ∈ Gd sthufefnix th isere al sios no history h such that h0w wis a Gsuf tfihxe nof t he ean ids hw ∈ G. [sent-219, score-0.509]
</p><p>73 Hence, for every state h directly backing off to h0 (order |V |), and for every n-gram arc leaving stat(eo rhd0e (order |V |), some vearylu ne- gmrausmt b aer accumulated. [sent-225, score-0.373]
</p><p>74 T(hoisr can V be |) particularly clearly seen autm mthueunigram state, which has an arc for every unigram (the size of the vocabulary): for every bigram state (also order of the vocabulary), in the naive algorithm we must look for every possible arc. [sent-226, score-0.447]
</p><p>75 Importantly, the denominator is calculated by first assuming that all higher order states back off to the current n-gram, then subtract out the mass associated with those that are already observed at the higher order. [sent-229, score-0.296]
</p><p>76 Because smoothing is not necessarily con48  strained across n-gram orders, it is possible that higher-order n-grams could be smoothed less than lower order n-grams, so that the numerator of equation 8 can be less than zero, which is not valid. [sent-232, score-0.607]
</p><p>77 A value less than zero means that the higher order n-grams will already produce the n-gram more frequently than its smoothed expected frequency. [sent-233, score-0.316]
</p><p>78 The α(h, h0) backoff weights in the denominator ensure normalization at the higher order states, and change as the n-gram parameters at the current state are modified. [sent-244, score-0.526]
</p><p>79 Further, the steady state probabilities will change as the model changes. [sent-245, score-0.368]
</p><p>80 Hence, at each state, we must iterate the calculation ofthe denominator term: first adjust n-gram weights and normalize; then recalculate backoff weights at higher order states and iterate. [sent-246, score-0.543]
</p><p>81 After the entire model has been re-estimated, the steady state probability calculation presented in Section 4. [sent-248, score-0.436]
</p><p>82 This fixes part ofthe problem perplexity does not degrade as much as the Kneser-Ney pruned model in Table 1 but, as argued earlier in this paper, this is not the sole reason for the degradation and the perplexity remains extremely inflated. [sent-272, score-0.687]
</p><p>83 Note that unigrams –  –  –  –  in the models are never pruned, hence all models assign probabilities over an identical vocabulary and perplexity is comparable across models. [sent-275, score-0.4]
</p><p>84 We then apply the marginal distribution constraints, and convert the result back to ARPA format for perplexity evaluation with the SRILM toolkit. [sent-279, score-0.443]
</p><p>85 For pruned models, the SRILM toolkit does not impose such a requirement, hence explicit arcs are added to the 49  AWSDMmibR,tWoKesi. [sent-282, score-0.38]

<p>Author: Brian Roark ; Cyril Allauzen ; Michael Riley</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm for re-estimating parameters of backoff n-gram language models so as to preserve given marginal distributions, along the lines of wellknown Kneser-Ney (1995) smoothing. Unlike Kneser-Ney, our approach is designed to be applied to any given smoothed backoff model, including models that have already been heavily pruned.

Streaming and sorting enables the algorithm to scale to much larger models by using a fixed amount of RAM and variable amount of disk. Using one machine with 140 GB RAM for 2.8 days, we built an unpruned model on 126 billion tokens. Machine translation experiments with this model show improvement of 0.8 BLEU point over constrained systems for the 2013 Workshop on Machine Translation task in three language pairs. Our algorithm is also faster for small models: we estimated a model on 302 million tokens using 7.7% of the RAM and 14.0% of the wall time taken by SRILM. The code is open source as part of KenLM.</p><p>3 0.14409813 <a title="325-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Learning_to_Prune%3A_Context-Sensitive_Pruning_for_Syntactic_MT.html">226 acl-2013-Learning to Prune: Context-Sensitive Pruning for Syntactic MT</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenduan Xu ; Yue Zhang ; Philip Williams ; Philipp Koehn</p><p>Abstract: We present a context-sensitive chart pruning method for CKY-style MT decoding. Source phrases that are unlikely to have aligned target constituents are identified using sequence labellers learned from the parallel corpus, and speed-up is obtained by pruning corresponding chart cells. The proposed method is easy to implement, orthogonal to cube pruning and additive to its pruning power. On a full-scale Englishto-German experiment with a string-totree model, we obtain a speed-up of more than 60% over a strong baseline, with no loss in BLEU.</p><p>4 0.1380423 <a title="325-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Combination_of_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_and_Factored_Language_Models_for_Code-Switching_Language_Modeling.html">84 acl-2013-Combination of Recurrent Neural Networks and Factored Language Models for Code-Switching Language Modeling</a></p>

<p>Author: David Kauchak</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we examine language modeling for text simplification. Unlike some text-to-text translation tasks, text simplification is a monolingual translation task allowing for text in both the input and output domain to be used for training the language model. We explore the relationship between normal English and simplified English and compare language models trained on varying amounts of text from each. We evaluate the models intrinsically with perplexity and extrinsically on the lexical simplification task from SemEval 2012. We find that a combined model using both simplified and normal English data achieves a 23% improvement in perplexity and a 24% improvement on the lexical simplification task over a model trained only on simple data. Post-hoc analysis shows that the additional unsimplified data provides better coverage for unseen and rare n-grams.</p><p>5 0.61672449 <a title="325-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Combination_of_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_and_Factored_Language_Models_for_Code-Switching_Language_Modeling.html">84 acl-2013-Combination of Recurrent Neural Networks and Factored Language Models for Code-Switching Language Modeling</a></p>

<p>Author: Svitlana Volkova ; Pallavi Choudhury ; Chris Quirk ; Bill Dolan ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: Procedural dialog systems can help users achieve a wide range of goals. However, such systems are challenging to build, currently requiring manual engineering of substantial domain-specific task knowledge and dialog management strategies. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn procedural dialog systems given only light supervision, of the type that can be provided by non-experts. We consider domains where the required task knowledge exists in textual form (e.g., instructional web pages) and where system builders have access to statements of user intent (e.g., search query logs or dialog interactions). To learn from such textual resources, we describe a novel approach that first automatically extracts task knowledge from instructions, then learns a dialog manager over this task knowledge to provide assistance. Evaluation in a Microsoft Office domain shows that the individual components are highly accurate and can be integrated into a dialog system that provides effective help to users.</p><p>3 0.77675164 <a title="325-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-A_System_for_Summarizing_Scientific_Topics_Starting_from_Keywords.html">23 acl-2013-A System for Summarizing Scientific Topics Starting from Keywords</a></p>
<p>Author: Rahul Jha ; Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of automatic generation of scientific surveys starting from keywords provided by a user. We present a system that can take a topic query as input and generate a survey of the topic by first selecting a set of relevant documents, and then selecting relevant sentences from those documents. We discuss the issues of robust evaluation of such systems and describe an evaluation corpus we generated by manually extracting factoids, or information units, from 47 gold standard documents (surveys and tutorials) on seven topics in Natural Language Processing. We have manually annotated 2,625 sentences with these factoids (around 375 sentences per topic) to build an evaluation corpus for this task. We present evaluation results for the performance of our system using this annotated data.</p><p>4 0.72655028 <a title="325-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Paraphrase-Driven_Learning_for_Open_Question_Answering.html">272 acl-2013-Paraphrase-Driven Learning for Open Question Answering</a></p>
<p>Author: Anthony Fader ; Luke Zettlemoyer ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: We study question answering as a machine learning problem, and induce a function that maps open-domain questions to queries over a database of web extractions. Given a large, community-authored, question-paraphrase corpus, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn a semantic lexicon and linear ranking function without manually annotating questions. Our approach automatically generalizes a seed lexicon and includes a scalable, parallelized perceptron parameter estimation scheme. Experiments show that our approach more than quadruples the recall of the seed lexicon, with only an 8% loss in precision.</p><p>5 0.65676844 <a title="325-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Transition-based_Dependency_Parsing_with_Selectional_Branching.html">358 acl-2013-Transition-based Dependency Parsing with Selectional Branching</a></p>
<p>Author: Jinho D. Choi ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach, called selectional branching, which uses confidence estimates to decide when to employ a beam, providing the accuracy of beam search at speeds close to a greedy transition-based dependency parsing approach. Selectional branching is guaranteed to perform a fewer number of transitions than beam search yet performs as accurately. We also present a new transition-based dependency parsing algorithm that gives a complexity of O(n) for projective parsing and an expected linear time speed for non-projective parsing. With the standard setup, our parser shows an unlabeled attachment score of 92.96% and a parsing speed of 9 milliseconds per sentence, which is faster and more accurate than the current state-of-the-art transitionbased parser that uses beam search.</p><p>6 0.61324203 <a title="325-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Part-of-Speech_Induction_in_Dependency_Trees_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">276 acl-2013-Part-of-Speech Induction in Dependency Trees for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

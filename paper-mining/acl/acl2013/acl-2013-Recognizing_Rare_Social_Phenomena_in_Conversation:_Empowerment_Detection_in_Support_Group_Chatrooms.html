Important behavioral categories, though, are often sparse and often appear only in specific subsections of a conversation. This makes supervised machine learning difficult, through a combination of noisy features and unbalanced class distributions. We propose within-instance content selection, using cue features to selectively suppress sections of text and biasing the remaining representation towards minority classes.

[sent-4, score-0.551]
</p><p>2 We show the effectiveness of this technique in automated annotation of empowerment language in online  ,  support group chatrooms. [sent-5, score-0.679]
</p><p>3 The study of conversational transcripts is a key domain in this new frontier. [sent-9, score-0.162]
</p><p>4 There are certain social and behavioral phenomena in conversation that cannot be easily identified through questionnaire data, self-reported surveys, or easily extracted user metadata. [sent-10, score-0.254]
</p><p>5 Examples of these social phenomena in conversation include overt displays of power (Prabhakaran et al. [sent-11, score-0.254]
</p><p>6 Manually annotating these social phenomena cannot scale to large data, so researchers turn to automated annotation of transcripts (Ros e´ et al. [sent-16, score-0.284]
</p><p>7 While machine learning is highly effective for annotation tasks with relatively balanced labels, such as sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2004), more complex social functions are often rarer. [sent-18, score-0.206]
</p><p>8 This leads to unbalanced class label distributions and a much more difficult machine learning task. [sent-19, score-0.15]
</p><p>9 Moreover, features indicative of rare social annotations tend to be drowned out in favor of features biased towards the majority class. [sent-20, score-0.31]
</p><p>10 The net effect is that classification algorithms tend to bias towards the majority class, giving low accuracy for rare class detection. [sent-21, score-0.246]
</p><p>11 Automated annotation of social phenomena also brings opportunities for real-world applications. [sent-22, score-0.207]
</p><p>12 For example, real-time annotation of conversation can power adaptive intervention in collaborative learning settings (Rummel et al. [sent-23, score-0.295]
</p><p>13 It  is critical to avoid intervening in the case of erroneous annotations, as providing unnecessary or inappropriate support in such a setting has been shown to be harmful to group performance and social cohesion (Dillenbourg, 2002; Stahl, 2012). [sent-26, score-0.189]
</p><p>14 We propose adaptations to existing machine learning algorithms which improve recognition of rare annotations in conversational text data. [sent-27, score-0.251]
</p><p>15 This allows features which predict minority classes to gain prominence, helping to sidestep the frequency of common features pointing to a majority class label. [sent-30, score-0.43]

</p><p>17 Using these techniques, we demonstrate a significant improvement in classifier performance when recognizing the language of empowerment in support group chatrooms, a critical application area for researchers studying conversational interactions in healthcare (Uden-Kraan et al. [sent-36, score-0.727]
</p><p>18 We introduce the domain of empowerment in support contexts, along with previous studies on the challenges that these annotations (and similar others) bring to machine learning. [sent-39, score-0.606]
</p><p>19 2  Background  We ground this paper’s discussion of machine learning with a real problem, turning to the annotation of empowerment language in chat1 . [sent-43, score-0.592]
</p><p>20 Participants in online support groups feel increased empowerment (Uden-Kraan et al. [sent-45, score-0.567]
</p><p>21 Quantitative studies have shown the effect of empowerment through statistical methods such as structural equation modeling (Vauth et al. [sent-48, score-0.52]
</p><p>22 Pioneering work has demonstrated the ability to distinguish empowerment language in written texts, including prompted writ-  ing samples (Pennebaker and Seagal, 1999), nar1Definitions of empowerment are closely related to the notion of self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997). [sent-53, score-1.04]
</p><p>23 Users, of course, do not express empowerment in every thread in which they participate, which leads to a challenge for machine learning. [sent-63, score-0.638]
</p><p>24 3  Data  Our data consists of a set of chatroom conversation transcripts from the Cancer Support Community2. [sent-68, score-0.156]
</p><p>25 This data offers potentially rich insight into coping and social support; however, annotating such a dataset by hand would be prohibitively ex-  pensive, even when it is already transcribed. [sent-71, score-0.158]
</p><p>26 org 3All annotations were found to be adequately reliable between humans, with thread disentanglement f = 0. [sent-76, score-0.199]
</p><p>27 105  Figure 1: An example mapping from a single thread’s chat lines (left) to the per-user, per-thread instances used for classification in this paper (right), with example annotations for self-empowerment indicated. [sent-79, score-0.306]
</p><p>28 A novel peruser, per-thread annotation was then employed for empowerment annotation, following a coding manual based on definitions like those in Section  2. [sent-81, score-0.592]
</p><p>29 Each user was assigned a label of positive or negative empowerment if they exhibited such emotions, or was left blank if they did not do so within the context of that thread. [sent-82, score-0.555]
</p><p>30 However, for our task, a per-user, per-thread annotation is more appropriate, because empowerment is often indicated best through narrative (Hoybye et al. [sent-87, score-0.592]
</p><p>31 Assigning labels based on thread boundaries allows for context to be meaningfully taken into account, without crossing topic boundaries. [sent-94, score-0.165]
</p><p>32 However, this granularity comes with a price: the distribution of class values in these instances is highly skewed. [sent-95, score-0.175]
</p><p>33 Many threads can have multiple lines of contributions that are topically related to an expression of empowerment (and thus belong in the same thread), but which do not indicate any empowerment themselves. [sent-98, score-1.187]
</p><p>34 We know from research in discourse analysis that many sections of conversations are formulaic and rote, like introductions and greetings (Schegloff, 1968). [sent-101, score-0.157]
</p><p>35 While techniques for predicting rare events (Weiss and Hirsh, 1998) and compensating for class imbalance (Frank and 106  Bouckaert, 2006), these approaches generally focus on statistical properties oflarge class sets without taking the nature of their datasets into account. [sent-106, score-0.225]
</p><p>36 In the next section, we propose a new algorithm which takes advantage specifically of the linguistic phenomena in the conversation-based data that we study for empowerment detection. [sent-107, score-0.561]
</p><p>37 4  Cue Discovery for Content Selection  Our algorithm performs content selection by learning a set of cue features. [sent-109, score-0.259]
</p><p>38 Each of these features indicates some linguistic function within the discourse which should downplay the importance of features either before or after that discourse marker. [sent-110, score-0.156]
</p><p>39 Many researchers have attempted to make use of cue phrases (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993), especially for segmentation both in prose (Hearst, 1997) and conversation (Galley et al. [sent-113, score-0.275]
</p><p>40 The approach of content selection, meanwhile, has been explored for sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2004), where individual sentences may be less subjective and there-  fore less relevant to the sentiment classification task. [sent-115, score-0.134]
</p><p>41 While we have coarse-grained annotations of empowerment, there is no direct annotation of what makes a good cue for content selection. [sent-118, score-0.321]
</p><p>42 With our cues, we hope to take advantage of shallow discourse structure in conversation, such as contrastive markers, making use of implicit structure in the conversational domain. [sent-119, score-0.203]

</p><p>44 Our total set of n instances I thus consists of instances {I1, I2, . [sent-127, score-0.212]
</p><p>45 We define a content selection rule as a pairing  r = hc, ti between a cue feature c ∈ X and a selrec =tio hnc ,futinc bteitowne te ∈ aT c. [sent-142, score-0.305]

</p><p>51 2 Algorithm Our ensemble learning follows the paradigm of cross-validated committees (Parmanto et al. [sent-159, score-0.244]
</p><p>52 , 1996), where k ensemble members are trained by subdividing our training data into k subfolds. [sent-160, score-0.195]
</p><p>53 For each ensemble classifier, cue rules R are generated on k 1 subfolds (Trk) and evaluated on the re−  maining 1su sbufboflodld (Tek). [sent-161, score-0.375]
</p><p>54 In practice, with 21 training documents, 7-fold cross-validation, and k = 3 ensemble members, each generation set consists of 12 documents’ instances, while each evaluation set contains instances from 6 documents. [sent-162, score-0.267]
</p><p>55 After training on Trk, we measure the average probability assigned to the correct label of instances in Tek, but only for instances whose correct labels are minority classes (remember, because both Trk and Tek are drawn from the overall Tr, we have access to true class labels). [sent-165, score-0.669]
</p><p>56 We choose this subset of only minority instances, as we are not interested in optimizing to the majority class. [sent-166, score-0.361]
</p><p>57 For each of these candidates, we test its utility by selecting content as if it were an actual rule, then building a new classifier (trained on the generation set) using instances that have been altered in that way. [sent-170, score-0.195]
</p><p>58 In the evaluation set, we measure the difference in probability of minority class labels being assigned correctly between the baseline and this altered space. [sent-171, score-0.422]
</p><p>59 Each ensemble classifier is finally retrained on all training data, after applying the corresponding content selection rules to that data. [sent-177, score-0.357]
</p><p>60 , 1996), whose results are aggregated with a confidence voting method intended to favor rare labels (Erp et al. [sent-179, score-0.253]
</p><p>61 Cross-validated committees are an ensemble technique used to subsample training data to produce multiple hypotheses for classification. [sent-181, score-0.244]
</p><p>62 These values serve as inputs to a voting method to produce a final label for each instance. [sent-184, score-0.154]
</p><p>63 Compared to other ensemble methods, crossvalidated committees as described above are a good fit for our task, because of its unique unit of analysis. [sent-185, score-0.244]
</p><p>64 To aggregate the votes from members of this ensemble into a final prediction, we employ a variant on Selfridge’s Pandemonium (Selfridge, 1958). [sent-188, score-0.195]
</p><p>65 If a minority label is selected as the highestconfidence value in any classifier in our ensemble, it is selected. [sent-189, score-0.376]
</p><p>66 Thus consensus is required to elect the majority class, and the strongest minority candidate is elected otherwise. [sent-191, score-0.361]

</p><p>69 If there is a plausible model that has been trained which recognizes the possibility of a rare label, it is used; the prediction only reverts to the majority class when no plausible minority label could be chosen. [sent-196, score-0.593]
</p><p>70 As validation of this technique, we compare our “minority pandemonium” approach against both typical pandemonium and standard sum-rule confidence voting (Erp et al. [sent-197, score-0.244]
</p><p>71 1 Logistic Model Stumps One characteristic of highly skewed data is that, while minority labels may be expressed in a number of different surface forms, there are many obvious cases in which they do not apply. [sent-200, score-0.394]
</p><p>72 To remove those obvious instances, a very simple screening heuristic is often enough to eliminate frequent phenotypes of instances where the rare annotation is  not present. [sent-203, score-0.316]
</p><p>73 We achieve this instance screening by learning logistic model tree stumps (Landwehr et al. [sent-207, score-0.189]
</p><p>74 First, we define a set of features that split based on the number of lines an instance contains, from 1 to 10 (only a tiny fraction of instances are more than 10 lines long). [sent-212, score-0.254]

</p><p>76 We exhaustively sweep this feature space, and report the most successful stump rules for each annotation task. [sent-218, score-0.192]
</p><p>77 Furthermore, we assume that threads have been disentangled already, and our experiments use gold standard thread structure. [sent-223, score-0.233]
</p><p>78 While this is not a trivial assumption, prior work has shown thread disentanglement to be manageable (Mayfield et al. [sent-224, score-0.16]
</p><p>79 We compare  our methods against baselines including a majority baseline, a baseline logistic regression classifier with L2 regularized features, and two common ensemble methods, AdaBoost (Freund and Schapire, 1996) and bagging (Breiman, 1996) with logistic regression base classifiers5.

</p><p>82 While accuracy remains stable, this is due to predictions shifting away from the majority class and towards minority classes. [sent-240, score-0.465]
</p><p>83 Our  combined model using both logistic model tree stumps and content selection is significantly better than either alone (p < . [sent-241, score-0.241]
</p><p>84 To compare the minority pandemonium voting method against baselines of simple pandemonium and summed confidence voting, Table 3 presents the results of content selection wrappers with each voting method. [sent-243, score-0.897]
</p><p>85 Minority voting is more effective compared to standard confidence voting, improving κ while modestly reducing accuracy; this is typical of a shift towards minority class predictions. [sent-244, score-0.529]

</p><p>87 This is common when tasks have a high cost or carry high risk (for instance, providing real-time conversational supports with an agent, where inappropriate intervention could be disruptive). [sent-253, score-0.183]

</p><p>91 The split on line length corresponds to the observation that longer instances provide greater opportunity for personal narrative self-assessment to occur (95% of single-line instances are labeled NA). [sent-274, score-0.25]
</p><p>92 TheArticle category may serve as a proxy for  content length - article-less instances in our corpus include one-line social greetings and exchanges of contact information. [sent-275, score-0.291]
</p><p>93 Swear words may be a cue for awareness of self-empowerment - a recent study of women coping with illness reported that swearing in the presence of others, but not alone, was related to potentially harmful outcomes (Robbins et al. [sent-276, score-0.363]

</p><p>95 8  Conclusion  We have demonstrated an algorithm for improving automated classification accuracy on highly skewed tasks for conversational data. [sent-280, score-0.206]
</p><p>96 This algorithm, particularly its focus on content selection, is rooted in the structural format of our data, which can generalize to many tasks involving conversational data. [sent-281, score-0.179]
</p><p>97 This has real-world implications for professional intervention in social conversational domains, especially in scenarios where such an intervention is likely to be associated with a high cost or high risk. [sent-288, score-0.335]

<p>Author: Sanjika Hewavitharana ; Dennis Mehay ; Sankaranarayanan Ananthakrishnan ; Prem Natarajan</p><p>Abstract: We describe a translation model adaptation approach for conversational spoken language translation (CSLT), which encourages the use of contextually appropriate translation options from relevant training conversations. Our approach employs a monolingual LDA topic model to derive a similarity measure between the test conversation and the set of training conversations, which is used to bias translation choices towards the current context. A significant novelty of our adaptation technique is its incremental nature; we continuously update the topic distribution on the evolving test conversation as new utterances become available. Thus, our approach is well-suited to the causal constraint of spoken conversations. On an English-to-Iraqi CSLT task, the proposed approach gives significant improvements over a baseline system as measured by BLEU, TER, and NIST. Interestingly, the incremental approach outperforms a non-incremental oracle that has up-front knowledge of the whole conversation.</p><p>3 0.10521031 <a title="298-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-A_Bayesian_Model_for_Joint_Unsupervised_Induction_of_Sentiment%2C_Aspect_and_Discourse_Representations.html">2 acl-2013-A Bayesian Model for Joint Unsupervised Induction of Sentiment, Aspect and Discourse Representations</a></p>
<p>Author: Angeliki Lazaridou ; Ivan Titov ; Caroline Sporleder</p><p>Abstract: We propose a joint model for unsupervised induction of sentiment, aspect and discourse information and show that by incorporating a notion of latent discourse relations in the model, we improve the prediction accuracy for aspect and sentiment polarity on the sub-sentential level. We deviate from the traditional view of discourse, as we induce types of discourse relations and associated discourse cues relevant to the considered opinion analysis task; consequently, the induced discourse relations play the role of opinion and aspect shifters. The quantitative analysis that we conducted indicated that the integration of a discourse model increased the prediction accuracy results with respect to the discourse-agnostic approach and the qualitative analysis suggests that the induced representations encode a meaningful discourse structure.</p><p>4 0.10432609 <a title="298-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Stacking_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">328 acl-2013-Stacking for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Majid Razmara ; Anoop Sarkar</p><p>Abstract: We propose the use of stacking, an ensemble learning technique, to the statistical machine translation (SMT) models. A diverse ensemble of weak learners is created using the same SMT engine (a hierarchical phrase-based system) by manipulating the training data and a strong model is created by combining the weak models on-the-fly. Experimental results on two language pairs and three different sizes of training data show significant improvements of up to 4 BLEU points over a conventionally trained SMT model.</p><p>5 0.086717501 <a title="298-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Collective_Annotation_of_Linguistic_Resources%3A_Basic_Principles_and_a_Formal_Model.html">83 acl-2013-Collective Annotation of Linguistic Resources: Basic Principles and a Formal Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Ulle Endriss ; Raquel Fernandez</p><p>Abstract: Crowdsourcing, which offers new ways of cheaply and quickly gathering large amounts of information contributed by volunteers online, has revolutionised the collection of labelled data. Yet, to create annotated linguistic resources from this data, we face the challenge of having to combine the judgements of a potentially large group of annotators. In this paper we investigate how to aggregate individual annotations into a single collective annotation, taking inspiration from the field of social choice theory. We formulate a general formal model for collective annotation and propose several aggregation methods that go beyond the commonly used majority rule. We test some of our methods on data from a crowdsourcing experiment on textual entailment annotation.</p><p>6 0.083635576 <a title="298-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Sentiment_Relevance.html">318 acl-2013-Sentiment Relevance</a></p>

<p>Author: Elijah Mayfield ; David Adamson ; Carolyn Penstein Rose</p><p>Abstract: Automated annotation of social behavior in conversation is necessary for large-scale analysis of real-world conversational data. Important behavioral categories, though, are often sparse and often appear only in specific subsections of a conversation. This makes supervised machine learning difficult, through a combination of noisy features and unbalanced class distributions. We propose within-instance content selection, using cue features to selectively suppress sections of text and biasing the remaining representation towards minority classes. We show the effectiveness of this technique in automated annotation of empowerment language in online , support group chatrooms. Our technique is significantly more accurate than multiple baselines, especially when prioritizing high precision.</p><p>2 0.72832 <a title="298-lsi-2" href="./acl-2013-A_computational_approach_to_politeness_with_application_to_social_factors.html">30 acl-2013-A computational approach to politeness with application to social factors</a></p>
<p>Author: Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil ; Moritz Sudhof ; Dan Jurafsky ; Jure Leskovec ; Christopher Potts</p><p>Abstract: We propose a computational framework for identifying linguistic aspects of politeness. Our starting point is a new corpus of requests annotated for politeness, which we use to evaluate aspects of politeness theory and to uncover new interactions between politeness markers and context. These findings guide our construction of a classifier with domain-independent lexical and syntactic features operationalizing key components of politeness theory, such as indirection, deference, impersonalization and modality. Our classifier achieves close to human performance and is effective across domains. We use our framework to study the relationship between po- liteness and social power, showing that polite Wikipedia editors are more likely to achieve high status through elections, but, once elevated, they become less polite. We see a similar negative correlation between politeness and power on Stack Exchange, where users at the top of the reputation scale are less polite than those at the bottom. Finally, we apply our classifier to a preliminary analysis of politeness variation by gender and community.</p><p>3 0.69972116 <a title="298-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Automatic_detection_of_deception_in_child-produced_speech_using_syntactic_complexity_features.html">63 acl-2013-Automatic detection of deception in child-produced speech using syntactic complexity features</a></p>
<p>Author: Maria Yancheva ; Frank Rudzicz</p><p>Abstract: It is important that the testimony of children be admissible in court, especially given allegations of abuse. Unfortunately, children can be misled by interrogators or might offer false information, with dire consequences. In this work, we evaluate various parameterizations of five classifiers (including support vector machines, neural networks, and random forests) in deciphering truth from lies given transcripts of interviews with 198 victims of abuse between the ages of 4 and 7. These evaluations are performed using a novel set of syntactic features, including measures of complexity. Our results show that sentence length, the mean number of clauses per utterance, and the StajnerMitkov measure of complexity are highly informative syntactic features, that classification accuracy varies greatly by the age of the speaker, and that accuracy up to 91.7% can be achieved by support vector machines given a sufficient amount of data.</p><p>4 0.68550682 <a title="298-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Patient_Experience_in_Online_Support_Forums%3A_Modeling_Interpersonal_Interactions_and_Medication_Use.html">278 acl-2013-Patient Experience in Online Support Forums: Modeling Interpersonal Interactions and Medication Use</a></p>
<p>Author: Annie Chen</p><p>Abstract: Though there has been substantial research concerning the extraction of information from clinical notes, to date there has been less work concerning the extraction of useful information from patient-generated content. Using a dataset comprised of online support group discussion content, this paper investigates two dimensions that may be important in the extraction of patient-generated experiences from text; significant individuals/groups and medication use. With regard to the former, the paper describes an approach involving the pairing of important figures (e.g. family, husbands, doctors, etc.) and affect, and suggests possible applications of such techniques to research concerning online social support, as well as integration into search interfaces for patients. Additionally, the paper demonstrates the extraction of side effects and sentiment at different phases in patient medication use, e.g. adoption, current use, discontinuation and switching, and demonstrates the utility of such an application for drug safety monitoring in online discussion forums. 1</p><p>5 0.6665507 <a title="298-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Linguistic_Models_for_Analyzing_and_Detecting_Biased_Language.html">232 acl-2013-Linguistic Models for Analyzing and Detecting Biased Language</a></p>
<p>Author: Marta Recasens ; Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil ; Dan Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: Unbiased language is a requirement for reference sources like encyclopedias and scientific texts. Bias is, nonetheless, ubiquitous, making it crucial to understand its nature and linguistic realization and hence detect bias automatically. To this end we analyze real instances of human edits designed to remove bias from Wikipedia articles. The analysis uncovers two classes of bias: framing bias, such as praising or perspective-specific words, which we link to the literature on subjectivity; and epistemological bias, related to whether propositions that are presupposed or entailed in the text are uncontroversially accepted as true. We identify common linguistic cues for these classes, including factive verbs, implicatives, hedges, and subjective inten- cs . sifiers. These insights help us develop features for a model to solve a new prediction task of practical importance: given a biased sentence, identify the bias-inducing word. Our linguistically-informed model performs almost as well as humans tested on the same task.</p><p>6 0.66550255 <a title="298-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Annotating_named_entities_in_clinical_text_by_combining_pre-annotation_and_active_learning.html">52 acl-2013-Annotating named entities in clinical text by combining pre-annotation and active learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Mark Hopkins ; Jonathan May</p><p>Abstract: What do we want to learn from a translation competition and how do we learn it with confidence? We argue that a disproportionate focus on ranking competition participants has led to lots of different rankings, but little insight about which rankings we should trust. In response, we provide the first framework that allows an empirical comparison of different analyses of competition results. We then use this framework to compare several analytical models on data from the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT). 1 The WMT Translation Competition Every year, the Workshop on Machine Transla- , tion (WMT) conducts a competition between machine translation systems. The WMT organizers invite research groups to submit translation systems in eight different tracks: Czech to/from English, French to/from English, German to/from English, and Spanish to/from English. For each track, the organizers also assemble a panel of judges, typically machine translation specialists.1 The role of a judge is to repeatedly rank five different translations of the same source text. Ties are permitted. In Table 1, we show an example2 where a judge (we’ll call him “jdoe”) has ranked five translations of the French sentence “Il ne va pas.” Each such elicitation encodes ten pairwise comparisons, as shown in Table 2. For each competition track, WMT typically elicits between 5000 and 20000 comparisons. Once the elicitation process is complete, WMT faces a large database of comparisons and a question that must be answered: whose system is the best? 1Although in recent competitions, some ofthejudging has also been crowdsourced (Callison-Burch et al., 2010). 2The example does not use actual system output. jmay} @ sdl . com Table21r:a(451tniekW)MsTuycbejskhmtdeiunltmics“Hp r“eHt derfa eongris densolacstneogi tnsog.”bto. y”asking judges to simultaneously rank five translations, with ties permitted. In this (fictional) example, the source sentence is the French “Il ne va pas.” ble 1. A preference of 0 means neither translation was preferred. Otherwise the preference specifies the preferred system. 2 A Ranking Problem For several years, WMT used the following heuristic for ranking the translation systems: ORIGWMT(s) =win(sw)in +(s ti)e( +s t)ie +(s lo)ss(s) For system s, win (s) is the number of pairwise comparisons in which s was preferred, loss(s) is the number of comparisons in which s was dispreferred, and tie(s) is the number of comparisons in which s participated but neither system was preferred. Recently, (Bojar et al., 2011) questioned the adequacy of this heuristic through the following ar1416 Proce dingsS o f ita h,e B 5u1lgsta Arinan,u Aaulg Musete 4ti-n9g 2 o0f1 t3h.e ? Ac s2s0o1ci3a Atiosnso fcoirat Cio nm foprut Caotimonpaulta Lti nognuails Lti cnsg,u piasgteics 1416–1424, gument. Consider a competition with systems A and B. Suppose that the systems are different but equally good, such that one third of the time A is judged better than B, one third of the time B is judged better than A, and one third of the time they are judged to be equal. The expected values of ORIGWMT(A) and ORIGWMT(B) are both 2/3, so the heuristic accurately judges the systems to be equivalently good. Suppose however that we had duplicated B and had submitted it to the competition a second time as system C. Since B and C produce identical translations, they should always tie with one another. The expected value of ORIGWMT(A) would not change, but the expected value of ORIGWMT(B) would increase to 5/6, buoyed by its ties with system C. This vulnerability prompted (Bojar et al., 2011) to offer the following revision: BOJAR(s) =win(sw)in +(s lo)ss(s) The following year, it was BOJAR’s turn to be criticized, this time by (Lopez, 2012): Superficially, this appears to be an improvement....couldn’t a system still be penalized simply by being compared to [good systems] more frequently than its competitors? On the other hand, couldn’t a system be rewarded simply by being compared against a bad system more frequently than its competitors? Lopez’s concern, while reasonable, is less obviously damning than (Bojar et al., 2011)’s criticism of ORIGWMT. It depends on whether the collected set of comparisons is small enough or biased enough to make the variance in competition significant. While this hypothesis is plausible, Lopez makes no attempt to verify it. Instead, he offers a ranking heuristic of his own, based on a Minimum Feedback Arc solver. The proliferation of ranking heuristics continued from there. The WMT 2012 organizers (Callison-Burch et al., 2012) took Lopez’s ranking scheme and provided a variant called Most Proba- ble Ranking. Then, noting some potential pitfalls with that, they created two more, called Monte Carlo Playoffs and Expected Wins. While one could raise philosophical objections about each of these, where would it end? Ultimately, the WMT 2012 findings presented five different rankings for the English-German competition track, with no guidance about which ranking we should pay attention to. How can we know whether one ranking is better than other? Or is this even the right question to ask? 3 A Problem with Rankings Suppose four systems participate in a translation competition. Three of these systems are extremely close in quality. We’ll call these close1, close2, and close3. Nevertheless, close1 is very slightly better3 than close2, and close2 is very slightly better than close3. The fourth system, called terrific, is a really terrific system that far exceeds the other three. Now which is the better ranking? terrific, close3, close1, close2 close1, terrific, close2, close3 (1) (2) Spearman’s rho4 would favor the second ranking, since it is a less disruptive permutation of the gold ranking. But intuition favors the first. While its mistakes are minor, the second ranking makes the hard-to-forgive mistake of placing close1 ahead of the terrific system. The problem is not with Spearman’s rho. The problem is the disconnnect between the knowledge that we want a ranking to reflect and the knowledge that a ranking actually contains. Without this additional knowledge, we cannot determine whether one ranking is better than another, even if we know the gold ranking. We need to determine what information they lack, and define more rigorously what we hope to learn from a translation competition. 4 From Rankings to Relative Ability Ostensibly the purpose of a translation competition is to determine the relative ability of a set of translation systems. Let S be the space of all otrfan trsalnatsiloanti systems. Hereafter, we hwei lslp raecfeer o tfo Sll as nthslea space ostfe smtus.de Hntesr. a Wftee c,h woeos wei ltlh ires teerrm to t So evoke the metaphor of a translation competition as a standardized test, which shares the same goal: to assess the relative abilities of a set of participants. But what exactly do we mean by “ability”? Before formally defining this term, first recognize that it means little without context, namely: 3What does “better” mean? We’ll return to this question. 4Or Pearson’s correlation coefficient. 1417 1. What kind of source text do we want the systems to translate well? Say system A is great at translating travel-related documents, but terrible at translating newswire. Meanwhile, system B is pretty good at both. The question “which system is better?” requires us to state how much we care about travel versus newswire documents otherwise the question is underspecified. – 2. Who are we trying to impress? While it’s tempting to think that translation quality is a universal notion, the 50-60% interannotator agreement in WMT evaluations (CallisonBurch et al., 2012) suggests otherwise. It’s also easy to imagine reasons why one group of judges might have different priorities than another. Think a Fortune 500 company versus web forum users. Lawyers versus laymen. Non-native versus native speakers. Posteditors versus Google Translate users. Different groups have different uses for translation, and therefore different definitions of what “better” means. With this in mind, let’s define some additional elements of a translation competition.

Now assume a joint distribution P(s1, s2, x, j,π) specifying the probability that we ask judge j to evaluate students s1 and s2’s respective translations of source text x, and that judge j’s preference is π. We will further assume that the choice of student pair, source text, and judge are marginally independent of one another. In other words: P(s1, s2, x, j,π) = P(π|s1, s2, x,j) · P(x|s1, s2, j) = ·P(j|s1,s2) · P(s1,s2) P(π|s1, s2, x, j) · P(x) · P(j) · P(s1, s2) = PX(x) · PJ(j) · P(s1, s2) · P(π|s1, s2, x,j) X(x) 5As a reminder, 0 indicates no preference. It will be useful to reserve notation PX and PJ for the marginal distributions over source text and judges. We can marginalize over the source segments and judges to obtain a useful quantity: P(π|s1, s2) = X XPX(x) · PJ(j) · P(π|s1,s2,x,j) Xx∈X Xj∈J We refer to this as the hPX, PJi-relative ability of Wstued reenftesr s1 hanisd a s2. By using d-rifeflearteinvet marginal distributions PX, we can specify what kinds of source text interest us (for instance, PX could focus most of its probability mass on German tweets). Similarly, by using different marginal distributions PJ, we can specify what judges we want to impress (for instance, PJ could focus all of its mass on one important corporate customer or evenly among all fluent bilingual speakers of a language pair). With this machinery, we can express the purpose of a translation competition more clearly: to estimate the hPX, PJi-relative ability of a set toof eststuidmenattes. Ien h Pthe case orefl WMT, PJ presumably6 defines a space of competent source-totarget bilingual speakers, while PX defines a space of newswire documents. We’ll refer to an estimate of P(π|s1 , s2) as a preference rm toode anl. Istni moattheer o words, a prefer- ence model is a distribution Q(π|s1 , s2). Given a cseet moofd pairwise comparisons (e.g., Table 2), the challenge is to estimate a preference model Q(π|s1 , s2) such that Q is “close” to P. For measuring distributional proximity, a natural choice is KL-divergence (Kullback and Leibler, 195 1), but we cannot use it here because P is unknown. Fortunately, ifwe have i.i.d. data drawn from P, then we can do the next best thing and compute the perplexity of preference model Q on this heldout test data. Let D be a sequence of triples hs1, s2, πi wteshter dea tah.e L preferences π are i o.if.d t.r samples fr,oπmi P(π|s1 , s2). The perplexity of preference model Q on stest data D is: perplexity(Q|D) = 2−Phs1,s2,πi∈D |D1|log2Q(π|s1,s2) How do we obtain such a test set from competition data? Recall that a WMT competition produces pairwise comparisons like those in Table 2. 6One could argue that it specifies a space of machine translation specialists, but likely these individuals are thought to be a representative sample of a broader community. 1418 Let C be the set of comparisons hs1, s2, x, j,πi Lobettai Cne bde f trhoem s a t orfan csolamtipoanr competition. ,Cjo,mπipetition data C is not necessarily7 sampled i.i.d. fpreotmiti P(s1, s2, x, j,π) n beeccaeusssaer we may intentionally8 bias data collection towards certain students, judges or source text. Also, because WMT elicits its data in batches (see Table 1), every segment x of source text appears in at least ten comparisons. To create an appropriately-sized test set that closely resembles i.i.d. data, we isolate the subset C0 of comparisons whose source text appears isne ta tC most k comparisons, where k is the smallest positive integer such that |C0| >= 2000. We then cporesaitteiv teh ien tteegste sre stu uDch hfr thomat |CC0: D = {hs1, s2, πi|hs1, s2, x,j, πi ∈ C0} We reserve the remaining comparisons for training preference models. Table 3 shows the resulting dataset sizes for each competition track. Unlike with raw rankings, the claim that one preference model is better than another has testable implications. Given two competing models, we can train them on the same comparisons, and compare their perplexities on the test set. This gives us a quantitative9 answer to the question of which is the better model. We can then publish a system ranking based on the most trustworthy preference model. 5 Baselines Let’s begin then, and create some simple preference models to serve as baselines. 5.1 Uniform The simplest preference model is a uniform distribution over preferences, for any choice of students s1 s2: , Q(π|s1,s2) =31 ∀π ∈ Π This will be our only model that does not require training data, and its perplexity on any test set will be 3 (i.e. equal to number of possible preferences). 5.2 Adjusted Uniform Now suppose we have a set C of comparisons aNvoawilab sluep pfoors training.

C(s1 , s2) denote the subset comparing students s1 aCn(ds s2. Perhaps the simplest thing we can do with the training data is to estimate the probability of ties (i.e. preference 0). We can then distribute the remaining probability mass uniformly among the other two preferences: 6SQim(pπ|lse1B,sa2y)e=sia   n1M−o2d|C Ce0| lsiofthπer=wi0se 6.1 Independent Pairs Another simple model is the direct estimation of each relative ability P(π|s1 , s2) independently. In oetahcher words, f aobri eliatych P pair sof students s1 and s2, we estimate a separate preference distribution. The maximum likelihood estimate of each distribution would be: Q(π|s1,s2) =|C|Cπ((ss11,,ss22))|| ++ | CC πˆ(s(2s,2s,1s)1|)| However the maximum likelihood estimate would test poorly, since any zero probability estimates for test set preferences would result in infinite perplexity. To make this model practical, we assume a symmetric Dirichlet prior with strength α for each preference distribution. This gives us the following Bayesian estimate: Q(π|s1,s2) =α3α + + |C |πC((ss11,,ss22))|| + + | |CC πˆ((ss22,,ss11))|| We call this the Independent model. Pairs preference 6.2 Independent Students The Independent Pairs model makes a strong inde- pendence assumption. It assumes that even if we know that student A is much better than student B, and that student B is much better than student C, we can infer nothing about how student A will fare versus student C. Instead of directly estimating the relative ability P(π|s1 , s2) of students s1 and s2, we ctoivueld a binilsittyead P Ptry tso estimate the universal ability P(π|s1) Ps2∈S P(π|s1, s2) · P(s2|s1) of ietaych P i(nπd|sividual sPtud∈enSt s1 πa|nsd the)n try tso reconstruct the relativeP abilities from these estimates.

QA( dπo|swnside of this approach is that there is no principled way to reconstruct a preference model from the universal ability estimates. We experiment with three ad-hoc reconstructions. The asymmetric reconstruction simply ignores any information we have about student s2: Q(π|s1, s2) = Q(π|s1) The arithmetic and geometric reconstructions compute an arithmetic/geometric average of the two universal abilities: Q(π|s1,s2) Q(π|s1, s2) = Q(π|s1) +2 Q( πˆ|s2) = [Q(π|s1) ∗ Q(ˆ π|s2)]21 We respectively call these the (Asymmetric/Arithmetic/Geometric) Independent Students preference models.

Presuming the students are paired uniformly at random, this issue diminishes as more comparisons are elicited. But preference elicitation is expensive, so it makes sense to assess the relative ability of the students with as few elicitations as possible. Still, WMT 2012’s decision to eliminate references entirely is a bit of a draconian measure, a treatment of the symptom rather than the (perceived) disease. If our models cannot function in the presence of training data variation, then we should change the models, not the data. A model that only works when the students are all about the same level is not one we should rely on. We experiment with a simple model that relaxes some independence assumptions made by previous models, in order to allow training data variation (e.g. who a student has been paired with) to influence the estimation of the student abilities. Figure 1(left) shows plate notation (Koller and Friedman, 2009) for the model’s independence structure. First, each student’s ability distribution is drawn from a common prior distribution. Then a number of translation items are generated. Each item is authored by a student and has a quality drawn from the student’s ability distribution. Then a number of pairwise comparisons are generated. Each comparison has two options, each a translation item. The quality of each item is observed by a judge (possibly noisily) and then the judge states a preference by comparing the two observations. We investigate two parameterizations of this model: Gaussian and categorical. Figure 1(right) shows an example of the Gaussian parameterization. The student ability distributions are Gaussians with a known standard deviation σa, drawn from a zero-mean Gaussian prior with known standard deviation σ0. In the example, we show the ability distributions for students 6 (an aboveaverage student, whose mean is 0.4) and 14 (a poor student, whose mean is -0.6). We also show an item authored by each student. Item 43 has a somewhat low quality of -0.3 (drawn from student 14’s ability distribution), while item 205 is not student 6’s best work (he produces a mean quality of 0.4), but still has a decent quality at 0.2. Comparison 1pits these items against one another. A judge draws noise from a zero-mean Gaussian with known standard deviation σobs, then adds this to the item’s actual quality to get an observed quality. For the first option (item 43), the judge draws a noise of -0.12 to observe a quality of -0.42 (worse than it actually is). For the second option (item 205), the judge draws a noise of 0.15 to observe a quality of 0.35 (better than it actually is). Finally, the judge compares the two observed qualities. If the absolute difference is lower than his decision 1420 Figure 1: Plate notation (left) showing the independence tiated subnetwork structure of the IRT Models.

Shaded ellipses are variables observable from a set of comparisons. radius (which here is 0.5), then he states no preference (i.e. a preference of 0). Otherwise he prefers the item with the higher observed quality. The categorical parameterization is similar to the Gaussian parameterization, with the following differences. Item quality is not continuous, but rather a member of the discrete set {1, 2, ..., Λ}. rTahteh srtau d menetm ability tdhiest rdiibsuctrieotens are categorical distributions over {1, 2, ..., Λ}, and the student ability prior sis o a symmetric ,DΛir}ic,h alnetd dw tihthe strength αa.

Specifically, Pr(ν) is proportional to the value of the probability density function of the zero-mean Gaussian N(0, σobs). aWuses ieasntim Na(0te,dσ the model parameters with Gibbs sampling (Geman and Geman, 1984). We found that Gibbs sampling converged quickly and consistently10 for both parameterizations. Given the parameter estimates, we obtain a preference model Q(π|s1 , s2) through the inference query: Pr(comp.c0.pref = π | item.i0.author = s1, item.i00.author = s2 , comp.c0.opt1 = i0, comp.c0.opt2 = i00) − 10We ran 200 iterations with a burn-in of 50. where c0, i0, i00 are new comparison and item ids that do not appear in the training data. We call these models Item-Response Theoretic (IRT) models, to acknowledge their roots in the psychometrics (Thurstone, 1927; Bradley and Terry, 1952; Luce, 1959) and item-response theory (Hambleton, 1991 ; van der Linden and Hambleton, 1996; Baker, 2001) literature. Itemresponse theory is the basis of modern testing theory and drives adaptive standardized tests like the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). In particular, the Gaussian parameterization of our IRT models strongly resembles11 the Thurstone (Thurstone, 1927) and Bradley-Terry-Luce (Bradley and Terry, 1952; Luce, 1959) models of paired comparison and the 1PL normal-ogive and Rasch (Rasch, 1960) models of student testing. From the testing perspective, we can view each comparison as two students simultaneously posing a test question to the other: “Give me a translation of the source text which is better than mine.” The students can answer the question correctly, incorrectly, or they can provide a translation of analogous quality. An extra dimension of our models is judge noise, not a factor when modeling multiple-choice tests, for which the right answer is not subject to opinion. 11These models are not traditionally expressed using graphical models, although it is not unprecedented (Mislevy and Almond, 1997; Mislevy et al., 1999). 1421 (number of comparisons). Figure 2: WMT10 model perplexities. The perplexity of the uniform preference model is 3.0 for all training sizes. 8 Experiments We organized the competition data as described at the end of Section 4.

For each model and training size, we averaged the perplexities from 5 trials of each competition track. We then plotted average perplexity as a function of training size. These graphs are shown 12If k was greater than the total number of training comparisons, then we took the entire set. Figure 3: WMT1 1model perplexities. Figure 4: WMT12 model perplexities. in Figure 2 (WMT10)13, and Figure 4 (WMT12). For WMT10 and WMT1 1, the best models were the IRT models, with the Gaussian parameterization converging the most rapidly and reaching the lowest perplexity. For WMT12, in which reference translations were excluded from the competition, four models were nearly indistinguishable: the two IRT models and the two averaged Independent Student models. This somewhat validates the organizers’ decision to exclude the references, particularly given WMT’s use of the BOJAR ranking heuristic (the nucleus of the Independent Student models) for its official rankings. 13Results for WMT10 exclude the German-English and English-German tracks, since we used these to tune our model hyperparameters. These were set as follows. The Dirichlet strength for each baseline was 1. For IRT-Gaussian: σ0 = 1.0, σobs = 1.0, σa = 0.5, and the decision radius was 0.4. For IRT-Categorical: Λ = 8, σobs = 1.0, αa = 0.5, and the decision radius was 0. 1422 Figure 6: English-Czech WMT1 1 results (average of 5 trainings on 1600 comparisons). Error bars (left) indicate one stddev of the estimated ability means.

Figure 5: WMT10 model perplexities sourced versus expert training). (crowd- The IRT models proved the most robust at handling judge noise. We repeated the WMT10 experiment using the same test sets, but using the unfiltered crowdsourced comparisons (rather than “expert”14 comparisons) for training. Figure 5 shows the results. Whereas the crowdsourced noise considerably degraded the Geometric Independent Students model, the IRT models were remarkably robust. IRT-Gaussian in particular came close to replicating the performance of Geometric Independent Students trained on the much cleaner expert data. This is rather impressive, since the crowdsourced judges agree only 46.6% of the time, compared to a 65.8% agreement rate among 14I.e., machine translation specialists. expert judges (Callison-Burch et al., 2010). Another nice property of the IRT models is that they explicitly model student ability, so they yield a natural ranking. For training size 1600 of the WMT1 1 English-Czech track, Figure 6 (left) shows the mean student abilities learned by the IRT-Gaussian model. The error bars show one standard deviation of the ability means (recall that we performed 5 trials, each with a random training subset of size 1600). These results provide further insight into a case analyzed by (Lopez, 2012), which raised concern about the relative ordering of online-B, cu-bojar, and cu-marecek. According to IRT-Gaussian’s analysis of the data, these three students are so close in ability that any ordering is essentially arbitrary. Short of a full ranking, the analysis does suggest four strata. Viewing one of IRT-Gaussian’s induced preference models as a heatmap15 (Figure 6, right), four bands are discernable. First, the reference sentences are clearly the darkest (best). Next come students 2-7, followed by the slightly lighter (weaker) students 810, followed by the lightest (weakest) student 11. 9 Conclusion WMT has faced a crisis of confidence lately, with researchers raising (real and conjectured) issues with its analytical methodology.

Estimates of relative ability (the expected head-to-head performance of system pairs over a probability space of judges and source text) can be empirically compared, granting substance to previously nebulous questions like: 1. Is my analysis better than your analysis? Rather than the current anecdotal approach to comparing competition analyses (e.g. presenting example rankings that seem somehow wrong), we can empirically compare the predictive power of the models on test data. 2. How much of an impact does judge noise have on my conclusions? We showed that judge noise can have a significant impact on the quality of our conclusions, if we use the wrong models. However, the IRTGaussian appears to be quite noise-tolerant, giving similar-quality conclusions on both expert and crowdsourced comparisons. 3. How many comparisons should Ielicit? Many of our preference models (including IRT-Gaussian and Geometric Independent Students) are close to convergence at around 1000 comparisons. This suggests that we can elicit far fewer comparisons and still derive confident conclusions. This is the first time a concrete answer to this question has been provided. References F.B.

We propose a new concept, sentiment relevance, to make this distinction and argue that it better reflects the requirements of sentiment analysis systems. We demonstrate experimentally that sentiment relevance and subjectivity are related, but different. Since no large amount of labeled training data for our new notion of sentiment relevance is available, we investigate two semi-supervised methods for creating sentiment relevance classifiers: a distant supervision approach that leverages structured information about the domain of the reviews; and transfer learning on feature representations based on lexical taxonomies that enables knowledge transfer.

However, they are far from containing only interesting semantic relations. As a consequence, improving such thesaurus is an important issue that is mainly tackled indirectly through the improvement of semantic similarity measures. In this article, we propose a more direct approach focusing on the identification of the neighbors of a thesaurus entry that are not semantically linked to this entry. This identification relies on a discriminative classifier trained from unsupervised selected examples for building a distributional model of the entry in texts. Its bad neighbors are found by applying this classifier to a representative set of occurrences of each of these neighbors.

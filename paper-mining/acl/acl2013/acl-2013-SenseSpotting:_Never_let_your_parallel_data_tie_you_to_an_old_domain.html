<p>Author: Mohammad Taher Pilehvar ; David Jurgens ; Roberto Navigli</p><p>Abstract: Semantic similarity is an essential component of many Natural Language Processing applications. However, prior methods for computing semantic similarity often operate at different levels, e.g., single words or entire documents, which requires adapting the method for each data type. We present a unified approach to semantic similarity that operates at multiple levels, all the way from comparing word senses to comparing text documents. Our method leverages a common probabilistic representation over word senses in order to compare different types of linguistic data. This unified representation shows state-ofthe-art performance on three tasks: seman- tic textual similarity, word similarity, and word sense coarsening.</p><p>3 0.19469398 <a title="316-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Density_Maximization_in_Context-Sense_Metric_Space_for_All-words_WSD.html">111 acl-2013-Density Maximization in Context-Sense Metric Space for All-words WSD</a></p>
<p>Author: Koichi Tanigaki ; Mitsuteru Shiba ; Tatsuji Munaka ; Yoshinori Sagisaka</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel smoothing model with a combinatorial optimization scheme for all-words word sense disambiguation from untagged corpora. By generalizing discrete senses to a continuum, we introduce a smoothing in context-sense space to cope with data-sparsity resulting from a large variety of linguistic context and sense, as well as to exploit senseinterdependency among the words in the same text string. Through the smoothing, all the optimal senses are obtained at one time under maximum marginal likelihood criterion, by competitive probabilistic kernels made to reinforce one another among nearby words, and to suppress conflicting sense hypotheses within the same word. Experimental results confirmed the superiority of the proposed method over conventional ones by showing the better performances beyond most-frequent-sense baseline performance where none of SemEval2 unsupervised systems reached.</p><p>4 0.16757913 <a title="316-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Neighbors_Help%3A_Bilingual_Unsupervised_WSD_Using_Context.html">258 acl-2013-Neighbors Help: Bilingual Unsupervised WSD Using Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Sudha Bhingardive ; Samiulla Shaikh ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is one of the toughest problems in NLP, and in WSD, verb disambiguation has proved to be extremely difficult, because of high degree of polysemy, too fine grained senses, absence of deep verb hierarchy and low inter annotator agreement in verb sense annotation. Unsupervised WSD has received widespread attention, but has performed poorly, specially on verbs. Recently an unsupervised bilingual EM based algorithm has been proposed, which makes use only of the raw counts of the translations in comparable corpora (Marathi and Hindi). But the performance of this approach is poor on verbs with accuracy level at 25-38%. We suggest a modifica- tion to this mentioned formulation, using context and semantic relatedness of neighboring words. An improvement of 17% 35% in the accuracy of verb WSD is obtained compared to the existing EM based approach. On a general note, the work can be looked upon as contributing to the framework of unsupervised WSD through context aware expectation maximization.</p><p>5 0.14476179 <a title="316-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Automatic_Term_Ambiguity_Detection.html">62 acl-2013-Automatic Term Ambiguity Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Tyler Baldwin ; Yunyao Li ; Bogdan Alexe ; Ioana R. Stanoi</p><p>Abstract: While the resolution of term ambiguity is important for information extraction (IE) systems, the cost of resolving each instance of an entity can be prohibitively expensive on large datasets. To combat this, this work looks at ambiguity detection at the term, rather than the instance, level. By making a judgment about the general ambiguity of a term, a system is able to handle ambiguous and unambiguous cases differently, improving throughput and quality. To address the term ambiguity detection problem, we employ a model that combines data from language models, ontologies, and topic modeling. Results over a dataset of entities from four product domains show that the proposed approach achieves significantly above baseline F-measure of 0.96.</p><p>6 0.13824283 <a title="316-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Learning_a_Phrase-based_Translation_Model_from_Monolingual_Data_with_Application_to_Domain_Adaptation.html">223 acl-2013-Learning a Phrase-based Translation Model from Monolingual Data with Application to Domain Adaptation</a></p>

<p>Author: Tristan Miller ; Nicolai Erbs ; Hans-Peter Zorn ; Torsten Zesch ; Iryna Gurevych</p><p>Abstract: Implementations of word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithms tend to be tied to a particular test corpus format and sense inventory. This makes it difficult to test their performance on new data sets, or to compare them against past algorithms implemented for different data sets. In this paper we present DKPro WSD, a freely licensed, general-purpose framework for WSD which is both modular and extensible. DKPro WSD abstracts the WSD process in such a way that test corpora, sense inventories, and algorithms can be freely swapped. Its UIMA-based architecture makes it easy to add support for new resources and algorithms. Related tasks such as word sense induction and entity linking are also supported.</p><p>6 0.76212746 <a title="316-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Align%2C_Disambiguate_and_Walk%3A_A_Unified_Approach_for_Measuring_Semantic_Similarity.html">43 acl-2013-Align, Disambiguate and Walk: A Unified Approach for Measuring Semantic Similarity</a></p>

<p>Author: Kavitha Rajan</p><p>Abstract: Natural language can be easily understood by everyone irrespective of their differences in age or region or qualification. The existence of a conceptual base that underlies all natural languages is an accepted claim as pointed out by Schank in his Conceptual Dependency (CD) theory. Inspired by the CD theory and theories in Indian grammatical tradition, we propose a new set of meaning primitives in this paper. We claim that this new set of primitives captures the meaning inherent in verbs and help in forming an inter-lingual and computable ontological classification of verbs. We have identified seven primitive overlapping verb senses which substantiate our claim. The percentage of coverage of these primitives is 100% for all verbs in Sanskrit and Hindi and 3750 verbs in English. 1</p><p>2 0.87665617 <a title="316-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Learning_to_Prune%3A_Context-Sensitive_Pruning_for_Syntactic_MT.html">226 acl-2013-Learning to Prune: Context-Sensitive Pruning for Syntactic MT</a></p>

Source phrases that are unlikely to have aligned target constituents are identified using sequence labellers learned from the parallel corpus, and speed-up is obtained by pruning corresponding chart cells. The proposed method is easy to implement, orthogonal to cube pruning and additive to its pruning power. On a full-scale Englishto-German experiment with a string-totree model, we obtain a speed-up of more than 60% over a strong baseline, with no loss in BLEU.</p><p>3 0.85470766 <a title="316-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Simple%2C_readable_sub-sentences.html">322 acl-2013-Simple, readable sub-sentences</a></p>

Here we approach it as a straightforward machine translation task, and demonstrate that standard machine translation components can be adapted into a semantic parser. In experiments on the multilingual GeoQuery corpus we find that our parser is competitive with the state of the art, and in some cases achieves higher accuracy than recently proposed purpose-built systems. These results support the use of machine translation methods as an informative baseline in semantic parsing evaluations, and suggest that research in semantic parsing could benefit from advances in machine translation.</p><p>5 0.80911458 <a title="316-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Graph_Propagation_for_Paraphrasing_Out-of-Vocabulary_Words_in_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">174 acl-2013-Graph Propagation for Paraphrasing Out-of-Vocabulary Words in Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Majid Razmara ; Maryam Siahbani ; Reza Haffari ; Anoop Sarkar</p><p>Abstract: Out-of-vocabulary (oov) words or phrases still remain a challenge in statistical machine translation especially when a limited amount of parallel text is available for training or when there is a domain shift from training data to test data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to finding translations for oov words. We induce a lexicon by constructing a graph on source language monolingual text and employ a graph propagation technique in order to find translations for all the source language phrases. Our method differs from previous approaches by adopting a graph propagation approach that takes into account not only one-step (from oov directly to a source language phrase that has a translation) but multi-step paraphrases from oov source language words to other source language phrases and eventually to target language translations. Experimental results show that our graph propagation method significantly improves performance over two strong baselines under intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation metrics.</p><p>same-paper 6 0.80847073 <a title="316-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-SenseSpotting%3A_Never_let_your_parallel_data_tie_you_to_an_old_domain.html">316 acl-2013-SenseSpotting: Never let your parallel data tie you to an old domain</a></p>

<p>Author: Karl Moritz Hermann ; Phil Blunsom</p><p>Abstract: Modelling the compositional process by which the meaning of an utterance arises from the meaning of its parts is a fundamental task of Natural Language Processing. In this paper we draw upon recent advances in the learning of vector space representations of sentential semantics and the transparent interface between syntax and semantics provided by Combinatory Categorial Grammar to introduce Combinatory Categorial Autoencoders. This model leverages the CCG combinatory operators to guide a non-linear transformation of meaning within a sentence. We use this model to learn high dimensional embeddings for sentences and evaluate them in a range of tasks, demonstrating that the incorporation of syntax allows a concise model to learn representations that are both effective and general.</p><p>6 0.14081174 <a title="32-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Measuring_semantic_content_in_distributional_vectors.html">238 acl-2013-Measuring semantic content in distributional vectors</a></p>

<p>Author: Aurelie Herbelot ; Mohan Ganesalingam</p><p>Abstract: Some words are more contentful than others: for instance, make is intuitively more general than produce and fifteen is more ‘precise’ than a group. In this paper, we propose to measure the ‘semantic content’ of lexical items, as modelled by distributional representations. We investigate the hypothesis that semantic content can be computed using the KullbackLeibler (KL) divergence, an informationtheoretic measure of the relative entropy of two distributions. In a task focusing on retrieving the correct ordering of hyponym-hypernym pairs, the KL diver- gence achieves close to 80% precision but does not outperform a simpler (linguistically unmotivated) frequency measure. We suggest that this result illustrates the rather ‘intensional’ aspect of distributions.</p><p>6 0.63092417 <a title="32-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-The_Role_of_Syntax_in_Vector_Space_Models_of_Compositional_Semantics.html">347 acl-2013-The Role of Syntax in Vector Space Models of Compositional Semantics</a></p>

<p>Author: Reut Tsarfaty</p><p>Abstract: Stanford Dependencies (SD) provide a functional characterization of the grammatical relations in syntactic parse-trees. The SD representation is useful for parser evaluation, for downstream applications, and, ultimately, for natural language understanding, however, the design of SD focuses on structurally-marked relations and under-represents morphosyntactic realization patterns observed in Morphologically Rich Languages (MRLs). We present a novel extension of SD, called Unified-SD (U-SD), which unifies the annotation of structurally- and morphologically-marked relations via an inheritance hierarchy. We create a new resource composed of U-SDannotated constituency and dependency treebanks for the MRL Modern Hebrew, and present two systems that can automatically predict U-SD annotations, for gold segmented input as well as raw texts, with high baseline accuracy.</p><p>4 0.69443309 <a title="32-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Identifying_Sentiment_Words_Using_an_Optimization-based_Model_without_Seed_Words.html">188 acl-2013-Identifying Sentiment Words Using an Optimization-based Model without Seed Words</a></p>

Most existing researches exploit seed words, and lead to low robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization-based model for SWI. Unlike previous approaches, our model exploits the sentiment labels of documents instead of seed words. Several experiments on real datasets show that WEED is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with seed words.</p><p>5 0.69235897 <a title="32-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Compositional-ly_Derived_Representations_of_Morphologically_Complex_Words_in_Distributional_Semantics.html">87 acl-2013-Compositional-ly Derived Representations of Morphologically Complex Words in Distributional Semantics</a></p>

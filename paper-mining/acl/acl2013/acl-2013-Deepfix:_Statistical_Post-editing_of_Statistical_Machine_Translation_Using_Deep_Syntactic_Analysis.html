<p>Author: Ondrej Dusek ; Filip Jurcicek</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method of statistical morphological generation, i.e. the prediction of inflected word forms given lemma, part-of-speech and morphological features, aimed at robustness to unseen inputs. Our system uses a trainable classifier to predict “edit scripts” that are then used to transform lemmas into inflected word forms. Suffixes of lemmas are included as features to achieve robustness. We evaluate our system on 6 languages with a varying degree of morphological richness. The results show that the system is able to learn most morphological phenomena and generalize to unseen inputs, producing significantly better results than a dictionarybased baseline.</p><p>3 0.10462231 <a title="110-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Improving_machine_translation_by_training_against_an_automatic_semantic_frame_based_evaluation_metric.html">195 acl-2013-Improving machine translation by training against an automatic semantic frame based evaluation metric</a></p>
<p>Author: Chi-kiu Lo ; Karteek Addanki ; Markus Saers ; Dekai Wu</p><p>Abstract: We present the first ever results showing that tuning a machine translation system against a semantic frame based objective function, MEANT, produces more robustly adequate translations than tuning against BLEU or TER as measured across commonly used metrics and human subjective evaluation. Moreover, for informal web forum data, human evaluators preferred MEANT-tuned systems over BLEU- or TER-tuned systems by a significantly wider margin than that for formal newswire—even though automatic semantic parsing might be expected to fare worse on informal language. We argue thatbypreserving the meaning ofthe trans- lations as captured by semantic frames right in the training process, an MT system is constrained to make more accurate choices of both lexical and reordering rules. As a result, MT systems tuned against semantic frame based MT evaluation metrics produce output that is more adequate. Tuning a machine translation system against a semantic frame based objective function is independent ofthe translation model paradigm, so, any translation model can benefit from the semantic knowledge incorporated to improve translation adequacy through our approach.</p><p>4 0.097103909 <a title="110-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-A_Multi-Domain_Translation_Model_Framework_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">11 acl-2013-A Multi-Domain Translation Model Framework for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Rico Sennrich ; Holger Schwenk ; Walid Aransa</p><p>Abstract: While domain adaptation techniques for SMT have proven to be effective at improving translation quality, their practicality for a multi-domain environment is often limited because of the computational and human costs of developing and maintaining multiple systems adapted to different domains. We present an architecture that delays the computation of translation model features until decoding, allowing for the application of mixture-modeling techniques at decoding time. We also de- scribe a method for unsupervised adaptation with development and test data from multiple domains. Experimental results on two language pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of both our translation model architecture and automatic clustering, with gains of up to 1BLEU over unadapted systems and single-domain adaptation.</p><p>5 0.089932241 <a title="110-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Multilingual_Affect_Polarity_and_Valence_Prediction_in_Metaphor-Rich_Texts.html">253 acl-2013-Multilingual Affect Polarity and Valence Prediction in Metaphor-Rich Texts</a></p>
<p>Author: Zornitsa Kozareva</p><p>Abstract: Metaphor is an important way of conveying the affect of people, hence understanding how people use metaphors to convey affect is important for the communication between individuals and increases cohesion if the perceived affect of the concrete example is the same for the two individuals. Therefore, building computational models that can automatically identify the affect in metaphor-rich texts like “The team captain is a rock.”, “Time is money.”, “My lawyer is a shark.” is an important challenging problem, which has been of great interest to the research community. To solve this task, we have collected and manually annotated the affect of metaphor-rich texts for four languages. We present novel algorithms that integrate triggers for cognitive, affective, perceptual and social processes with stylistic and lexical information. By running evaluations on datasets in English, Spanish, Russian and Farsi, we show that the developed affect polarity and valence prediction technology of metaphor-rich texts is portable and works equally well for different languages.</p><p>6 0.088196613 <a title="110-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Dirt_Cheap_Web-Scale_Parallel_Text_from_the_Common_Crawl.html">120 acl-2013-Dirt Cheap Web-Scale Parallel Text from the Common Crawl</a></p>

We combine (i) features on sourceside syntactic subcategorization and (ii) an external knowledge base with quantitative, dependency-based information about target-side subcategorization frames. A manual evaluation of an English-toGerman translation task shows that the subcategorization information has a positive impact on translation quality through better prediction of case.</p><p>3 0.66073012 <a title="110-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Stem_Translation_with_Affix-Based_Rule_Selection_for_Agglutinative_Languages.html">330 acl-2013-Stem Translation with Affix-Based Rule Selection for Agglutinative Languages</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhiyang Wang ; Yajuan Lu ; Meng Sun ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: Current translation models are mainly designed for languages with limited morphology, which are not readily applicable to agglutinative languages as the difference in the way lexical forms are generated. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for translating agglutinative languages by treating stems and affixes differently. We employ stem as the atomic translation unit to alleviate data spareness. In addition, we associate each stemgranularity translation rule with a distribution of related affixes, and select desirable rules according to the similarity of their affix distributions with given spans to be translated. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves the translation performance on tasks of translating from three Turkic languages to Chinese.</p><p>4 0.62940758 <a title="110-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Learning_to_lemmatise_Polish_noun_phrases.html">227 acl-2013-Learning to lemmatise Polish noun phrases</a></p>
<p>Author: Adam Radziszewski</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to noun phrase lemmatisation where the main phase is cast as a tagging problem. The idea draws on the observation that the lemmatisation of almost all Polish noun phrases may be decomposed into transformation of singular words (tokens) that make up each phrase. We perform evaluation, which shows results similar to those obtained earlier by a rule-based system, while our approach allows to separate chunking from lemmatisation.</p><p>5 0.62739807 <a title="110-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Improving_machine_translation_by_training_against_an_automatic_semantic_frame_based_evaluation_metric.html">195 acl-2013-Improving machine translation by training against an automatic semantic frame based evaluation metric</a></p>

<p>Author: Goran Glavas ; Jan Snajder</p><p>Abstract: Identifying news stories that discuss the same real-world events is important for news tracking and retrieval. Most existing approaches rely on the traditional vector space model. We propose an approach for recognizing identical real-world events based on a structured, event-oriented document representation. We structure documents as graphs of event mentions and use graph kernels to measure the similarity between document pairs. Our experiments indicate that the proposed graph-based approach can outperform the traditional vector space model, and is especially suitable for distinguishing between topically similar, yet non-identical events.</p><p>3 0.62499648 <a title="110-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Addressing_Ambiguity_in_Unsupervised_Part-of-Speech_Induction_with_Substitute_Vectors.html">39 acl-2013-Addressing Ambiguity in Unsupervised Part-of-Speech Induction with Substitute Vectors</a></p>
<p>Author: Volkan Cirik</p><p>Abstract: We study substitute vectors to solve the part-of-speech ambiguity problem in an unsupervised setting. Part-of-speech tagging is a crucial preliminary process in many natural language processing applications. Because many words in natural languages have more than one part-of-speech tag, resolving part-of-speech ambiguity is an important task. We claim that partof-speech ambiguity can be solved using substitute vectors. A substitute vector is constructed with possible substitutes of a target word. This study is built on previous work which has proven that word substitutes are very fruitful for part-ofspeech induction. Experiments show that our methodology works for words with high ambiguity.</p><p>4 0.61576265 <a title="110-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-The_Haves_and_the_Have-Nots%3A_Leveraging_Unlabelled_Corpora_for_Sentiment_Analysis.html">345 acl-2013-The Haves and the Have-Nots: Leveraging Unlabelled Corpora for Sentiment Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Kashyap Popat ; Balamurali A.R ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya ; Gholamreza Haffari</p><p>Abstract: Expensive feature engineering based on WordNet senses has been shown to be useful for document level sentiment classification. A plausible reason for such a performance improvement is the reduction in data sparsity. However, such a reduction could be achieved with a lesser effort through the means of syntagma based word clustering. In this paper, the problem of data sparsity in sentiment analysis, both monolingual and cross-lingual, is addressed through the means of clustering. Experiments show that cluster based data sparsity reduction leads to performance better than sense based classification for sentiment analysis at document level. Similar idea is applied to Cross Lingual Sentiment Analysis (CLSA), and it is shown that reduction in data sparsity (after translation or bilingual-mapping) produces accuracy higher than Machine Translation based CLSA and sense based CLSA.</p><p>5 0.61562139 <a title="110-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Learning_to_Extract_International_Relations_from_Political_Context.html">224 acl-2013-Learning to Extract International Relations from Political Context</a></p>

Our unsupervised model brings together familiar components in natural language processing (like parsers and topic models) with contextual political information— temporal and dyad dependence—to infer latent event classes. We quantitatively evaluate the model’s performance on political science benchmarks: recovering expert-assigned event class valences, and detecting real-world conflict.

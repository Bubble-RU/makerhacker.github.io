<p>Author: Xipeng Qiu ; Le Tian ; Xuanjing Huang</p><p>Abstract: Retrieving similar questions is very important in community-based question answering(CQA) . In this paper, we propose a unified question retrieval model based on latent semantic indexing with tensor analysis, which can capture word associations among different parts of CQA triples simultaneously. Thus, our method can reduce lexical chasm of question retrieval with the help of the information of question content and answer parts. The experimental result shows that our method outperforms the traditional methods.</p><p>3 0.15728819 <a title="254-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Word_Alignment_Modeling_with_Context_Dependent_Deep_Neural_Network.html">388 acl-2013-Word Alignment Modeling with Context Dependent Deep Neural Network</a></p>
<p>Author: Nan Yang ; Shujie Liu ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou ; Nenghai Yu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore a novel bilingual word alignment approach based on DNN (Deep Neural Network), which has been proven to be very effective in various machine learning tasks (Collobert et al., 2011). We describe in detail how we adapt and extend the CD-DNNHMM (Dahl et al., 2012) method introduced in speech recognition to the HMMbased word alignment model, in which bilingual word embedding is discriminatively learnt to capture lexical translation information, and surrounding words are leveraged to model context information in bilingual sentences. While being capable to model the rich bilingual correspondence, our method generates a very compact model with much fewer parameters. Experiments on a large scale EnglishChinese word alignment task show that the proposed method outperforms the HMM and IBM model 4 baselines by 2 points in F-score.</p><p>4 0.1524839 <a title="254-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Deceptive_Answer_Prediction_with_User_Preference_Graph.html">107 acl-2013-Deceptive Answer Prediction with User Preference Graph</a></p>
<p>Author: Fangtao Li ; Yang Gao ; Shuchang Zhou ; Xiance Si ; Decheng Dai</p><p>Abstract: In Community question answering (QA) sites, malicious users may provide deceptive answers to promote their products or services. It is important to identify and filter out these deceptive answers. In this paper, we first solve this problem with the traditional supervised learning methods. Two kinds of features, including textual and contextual features, are investigated for this task. We further propose to exploit the user relationships to identify the deceptive answers, based on the hypothesis that similar users will have similar behaviors to post deceptive or authentic answers. To measure the user similarity, we propose a new user preference graph based on the answer preference expressed by users, such as “helpful” voting and “best answer” selection. The user preference graph is incorporated into traditional supervised learning framework with the graph regularization technique. The experiment results demonstrate that the user preference graph can indeed help improve the performance of deceptive answer prediction.</p><p>5 0.14848031 <a title="254-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Question_Answering_Using_Enhanced_Lexical_Semantic_Models.html">291 acl-2013-Question Answering Using Enhanced Lexical Semantic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Wen-tau Yih ; Ming-Wei Chang ; Christopher Meek ; Andrzej Pastusiak</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the answer sentence selection problem for question answering. Unlike previous work, which primarily leverages syntactic analysis through dependency tree matching, we focus on improving the performance using models of lexical semantic resources. Experiments show that our systems can be consistently and significantly improved with rich lexical semantic information, regardless of the choice of learning algorithms. When evaluated on a benchmark dataset, the MAP and MRR scores are increased by 8 to 10 points, compared to one of our baseline systems using only surface-form matching. Moreover, our best system also outperforms pervious work that makes use of the dependency tree structure by a wide margin.</p><p>6 0.1285405 <a title="254-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Automatic_Coupling_of_Answer_Extraction_and_Information_Retrieval.html">60 acl-2013-Automatic Coupling of Answer Extraction and Information Retrieval</a></p>

<p>Author: Nan Duan</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents two minimum Bayes risk (MBR) based Answer Re-ranking (MBRAR) approaches for the question answering (QA) task. The first approach re-ranks single QA system’s outputs by using a traditional MBR model, by measuring correlations between answer candidates; while the second approach reranks the combined outputs of multiple QA systems with heterogenous answer extraction components by using a mixture model-based MBR model. Evaluations are performed on factoid questions selected from two different domains: Jeopardy! and Web, and significant improvements are achieved on all data sets.</p><p>3 0.70731145 <a title="254-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Latent_Semantic_Tensor_Indexing_for_Community-based_Question_Answering.html">218 acl-2013-Latent Semantic Tensor Indexing for Community-based Question Answering</a></p>

<p>Author: Sean Szumlanski ; Fernando Gomez ; Valerie K. Sims</p><p>Abstract: We have elicited human quantitative judgments of semantic relatedness for 122 pairs of nouns and compiled them into a new set of relatedness norms that we call Rel-122. Judgments from individual subjects in our study exhibit high average correlation to the resulting relatedness means (r = 0.77, σ = 0.09, N = 73), although not as high as Resnik’s (1995) upper bound for expected average human correlation to similarity means (r = 0.90). This suggests that human perceptions of relatedness are less strictly constrained than perceptions of similarity and establishes a clearer expectation for what constitutes human-like performance by a computational measure of semantic relatedness. We compare the results of several WordNet-based similarity and relatedness measures to our Rel-122 norms and demonstrate the limitations of WordNet for discovering general indications of semantic relatedness. We also offer a critique of the field’s reliance upon similarity norms to evaluate relatedness measures.</p><p>2 0.8000505 <a title="254-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Shallow_Local_Multi-Bottom-up_Tree_Transducers_in_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">320 acl-2013-Shallow Local Multi-Bottom-up Tree Transducers in Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Britta Zeller ; Jan Snajder ; Sebastian Pado</p><p>Abstract: Derivational models are still an underresearched area in computational morphology. Even for German, a rather resourcerich language, there is a lack of largecoverage derivational knowledge. This paper describes a rule-based framework for inducing derivational families (i.e., clusters of lemmas in derivational relationships) and its application to create a highcoverage German resource, DERIVBASE, mapping over 280k lemmas into more than 17k non-singleton clusters. We focus on the rule component and a qualitative and quantitative evaluation. Our approach achieves up to 93% precision and 71% recall. We attribute the high precision to the fact that our rules are based on information from grammar books.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.78701699 <a title="254-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Multimodal_DBN_for_Predicting_High-Quality_Answers_in_cQA_portals.html">254 acl-2013-Multimodal DBN for Predicting High-Quality Answers in cQA portals</a></p>

<p>Author: Igor Labutov ; Hod Lipson</p><p>Abstract: We present a fast method for re-purposing existing semantic word vectors to improve performance in a supervised task. Recently, with an increase in computing resources, it became possible to learn rich word embeddings from massive amounts of unlabeled data. However, some methods take days or weeks to learn good embeddings, and some are notoriously difficult to train. We propose a method that takes as input an existing embedding, some labeled data, and produces an embedding in the same space, but with a better predictive performance in the supervised task. We show improvement on the task of sentiment classification with re- spect to several baselines, and observe that the approach is most useful when the training set is sufficiently small.</p><p>6 0.74010736 <a title="254-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Social_Text_Normalization_using_Contextual_Graph_Random_Walks.html">326 acl-2013-Social Text Normalization using Contextual Graph Random Walks</a></p>

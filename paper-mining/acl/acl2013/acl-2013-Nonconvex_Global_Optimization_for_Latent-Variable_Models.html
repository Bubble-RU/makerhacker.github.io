<p>Author: Kai Liu ; Yajuan Lu ; Wenbin Jiang ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a novel strategy for automatic induction of a monolingual dependency grammar under the guidance of bilingually-projected dependency. By moderately leveraging the dependency information projected from the parsed counterpart language, and simultaneously mining the underlying syntactic structure of the language considered, it effectively integrates the advantages of bilingual projection and unsupervised induction, so as to induce a monolingual grammar much better than previous models only using bilingual projection or unsupervised induction. We induced dependency gram- mar for five different languages under the guidance of dependency information projected from the parsed English translation, experiments show that the bilinguallyguided method achieves a significant improvement of 28.5% over the unsupervised baseline and 3.0% over the best projection baseline on average.</p><p>3 0.12819368 <a title="260-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Turning_on_the_Turbo%3A_Fast_Third-Order_Non-Projective_Turbo_Parsers.html">362 acl-2013-Turning on the Turbo: Fast Third-Order Non-Projective Turbo Parsers</a></p>

<p>Author: Miguel Almeida ; Andre Martins</p><p>Abstract: We present a dual decomposition framework for multi-document summarization, using a model that jointly extracts and compresses sentences. Compared with previous work based on integer linear programming, our approach does not require external solvers, is significantly faster, and is modular in the three qualities a summary should have: conciseness, informativeness, and grammaticality. In addition, we propose a multi-task learning framework to take advantage of existing data for extractive summarization and sentence compression. Experiments in the TAC2008 dataset yield the highest published ROUGE scores to date, with runtimes that rival those of extractive summarizers.</p><p>5 0.11228058 <a title="260-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-The_effect_of_non-tightness_on_Bayesian_estimation_of_PCFGs.html">348 acl-2013-The effect of non-tightness on Bayesian estimation of PCFGs</a></p>
<p>Author: Shay B. Cohen ; Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic context-free grammars have the unusual property of not always defining tight distributions (i.e., the sum of the “probabilities” of the trees the grammar generates can be less than one). This paper reviews how this non-tightness can arise and discusses its impact on Bayesian estimation of PCFGs. We begin by presenting the notion of “almost everywhere tight grammars” and show that linear CFGs follow it. We then propose three different ways of reinterpreting non-tight PCFGs to make them tight, show that the Bayesian estimators in Johnson et al. (2007) are correct under one of them, and provide MCMC samplers for the other two. We conclude with a discussion of the impact of tightness empirically.</p><p>6 0.10469144 <a title="260-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Supervised_Model_Learning_with_Feature_Grouping_based_on_a_Discrete_Constraint.html">334 acl-2013-Supervised Model Learning with Feature Grouping based on a Discrete Constraint</a></p>

<p>Author: Gourab Kundu ; Vivek Srikumar ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Given that structured output prediction is typically performed over entire datasets, one natural question is whether it is possible to re-use computation from earlier inference instances to speed up inference for future instances. Amortized inference has been proposed as a way to accomplish this. In this paper, first, we introduce a new amortized inference algorithm called the Margin-based Amortized Inference, which uses the notion of structured margin to identify inference problems for which previous solutions are provably optimal. Second, we introduce decomposed amortized inference, which is designed to address very large inference problems, where earlier amortization methods become less ef- fective. This approach works by decomposing the output structure and applying amortization piece-wise, thus increasing the chance that we can re-use previous solutions for parts of the output structure. These parts are then combined to a global coherent solution using Lagrangian relaxation. In our experiments, using the NLP tasks of semantic role labeling and entityrelation extraction, we demonstrate that with the margin-based algorithm, we need to call the inference engine only for a third of the test examples. Further, we show that the decomposed variant of margin-based amortized inference achieves a greater reduction in the number of inference calls.</p><p>3 0.70542794 <a title="260-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Variational_Inference_for_Structured_NLP_Models.html">382 acl-2013-Variational Inference for Structured NLP Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Jun Suzuki ; Masaaki Nagata</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a framework of supervised model learning that realizes feature grouping to obtain lower complexity models. The main idea of our method is to integrate a discrete constraint into model learning with the help of the dual decomposition technique. Experiments on two well-studied NLP tasks, dependency parsing and NER, demonstrate that our method can provide state-of-the-art performance even if the degrees of freedom in trained models are surprisingly small, i.e., 8 or even 2. This significant benefit enables us to provide compact model representation, which is especially useful in actual use.</p><p>5 0.64647579 <a title="260-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Exact_Maximum_Inference_for_the_Fertility_Hidden_Markov_Model.html">143 acl-2013-Exact Maximum Inference for the Fertility Hidden Markov Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Chris Quirk</p><p>Abstract: The notion of fertility in word alignment (the number of words emitted by a single state) is useful but difficult to model. Initial attempts at modeling fertility used heuristic search methods. Recent approaches instead use more principled approximate inference techniques such as Gibbs sampling for parameter estimation. Yet in practice we also need the single best alignment, which is difficult to find using Gibbs. Building on recent advances in dual decomposition, this paper introduces an exact algorithm for finding the single best alignment with a fertility HMM. Finding the best alignment appears important, as this model leads to a substantial improvement in alignment quality.</p><p>6 0.63909268 <a title="260-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Turning_on_the_Turbo%3A_Fast_Third-Order_Non-Projective_Turbo_Parsers.html">362 acl-2013-Turning on the Turbo: Fast Third-Order Non-Projective Turbo Parsers</a></p>

<p>Author: Jinho D. Choi ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach, called selectional branching, which uses confidence estimates to decide when to employ a beam, providing the accuracy of beam search at speeds close to a greedy transition-based dependency parsing approach. Selectional branching is guaranteed to perform a fewer number of transitions than beam search yet performs as accurately. We also present a new transition-based dependency parsing algorithm that gives a complexity of O(n) for projective parsing and an expected linear time speed for non-projective parsing. With the standard setup, our parser shows an unlabeled attachment score of 92.96% and a parsing speed of 9 milliseconds per sentence, which is faster and more accurate than the current state-of-the-art transitionbased parser that uses beam search.</p><p>4 0.79361898 <a title="260-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-A_Lattice-based_Framework_for_Joint_Chinese_Word_Segmentation%2C_POS_Tagging_and_Parsing.html">7 acl-2013-A Lattice-based Framework for Joint Chinese Word Segmentation, POS Tagging and Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhiguo Wang ; Chengqing Zong ; Nianwen Xue</p><p>Abstract: For the cascaded task of Chinese word segmentation, POS tagging and parsing, the pipeline approach suffers from error propagation while the joint learning approach suffers from inefficient decoding due to the large combined search space. In this paper, we present a novel lattice-based framework in which a Chinese sentence is first segmented into a word lattice, and then a lattice-based POS tagger and a lattice-based parser are used to process the lattice from two different viewpoints: sequential POS tagging and hierarchical tree building. A strategy is designed to exploit the complementary strengths of the tagger and parser, and encourage them to predict agreed structures. Experimental results on Chinese Treebank show that our lattice-based framework significantly improves the accuracy of the three sub-tasks. 1</p><p>5 0.79325897 <a title="260-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Crowd_Prefers_the_Middle_Path%3A_A_New_IAA_Metric_for_Crowdsourcing_Reveals_Turker_Biases_in_Query_Segmentation.html">99 acl-2013-Crowd Prefers the Middle Path: A New IAA Metric for Crowdsourcing Reveals Turker Biases in Query Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Rohan Ramanath ; Monojit Choudhury ; Kalika Bali ; Rishiraj Saha Roy</p><p>Abstract: Query segmentation, like text chunking, is the first step towards query understanding. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of crowdsourcing for this task. Through carefully designed control experiments and Inter Annotator Agreement metrics for analysis of experimental data, we show that crowdsourcing may not be a suitable approach for query segmentation because the crowd seems to have a very strong bias towards dividing the query into roughly equal (often only two) parts. Similarly, in the case of hierarchical or nested segmentation, turkers have a strong preference towards balanced binary trees.</p><p>6 0.79220074 <a title="260-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-A_Shift-Reduce_Parsing_Algorithm_for_Phrase-based_String-to-Dependency_Translation.html">19 acl-2013-A Shift-Reduce Parsing Algorithm for Phrase-based String-to-Dependency Translation</a></p>

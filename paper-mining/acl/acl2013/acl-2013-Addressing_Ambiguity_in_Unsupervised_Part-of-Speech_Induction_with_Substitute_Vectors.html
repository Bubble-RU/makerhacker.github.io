<p>Author: Tyler Baldwin ; Yunyao Li ; Bogdan Alexe ; Ioana R. Stanoi</p><p>Abstract: While the resolution of term ambiguity is important for information extraction (IE) systems, the cost of resolving each instance of an entity can be prohibitively expensive on large datasets. To combat this, this work looks at ambiguity detection at the term, rather than the instance, level. By making a judgment about the general ambiguity of a term, a system is able to handle ambiguous and unambiguous cases differently, improving throughput and quality. To address the term ambiguity detection problem, we employ a model that combines data from language models, ontologies, and topic modeling. Results over a dataset of entities from four product domains show that the proposed approach achieves significantly above baseline F-measure of 0.96.</p><p>3 0.14411145 <a title="39-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Improving_Text_Simplification_Language_Modeling_Using_Unsimplified_Text_Data.html">194 acl-2013-Improving Text Simplification Language Modeling Using Unsimplified Text Data</a></p>
<p>Author: David Kauchak</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we examine language modeling for text simplification. Unlike some text-to-text translation tasks, text simplification is a monolingual translation task allowing for text in both the input and output domain to be used for training the language model. We explore the relationship between normal English and simplified English and compare language models trained on varying amounts of text from each. We evaluate the models intrinsically with perplexity and extrinsically on the lexical simplification task from SemEval 2012. We find that a combined model using both simplified and normal English data achieves a 23% improvement in perplexity and a 24% improvement on the lexical simplification task over a model trained only on simple data. Post-hoc analysis shows that the additional unsimplified data provides better coverage for unseen and rare n-grams.</p><p>4 0.14341415 <a title="39-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-A_Multi-Domain_Translation_Model_Framework_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">11 acl-2013-A Multi-Domain Translation Model Framework for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Rico Sennrich ; Holger Schwenk ; Walid Aransa</p><p>Abstract: While domain adaptation techniques for SMT have proven to be effective at improving translation quality, their practicality for a multi-domain environment is often limited because of the computational and human costs of developing and maintaining multiple systems adapted to different domains. We present an architecture that delays the computation of translation model features until decoding, allowing for the application of mixture-modeling techniques at decoding time. We also de- scribe a method for unsupervised adaptation with development and test data from multiple domains. Experimental results on two language pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of both our translation model architecture and automatic clustering, with gains of up to 1BLEU over unadapted systems and single-domain adaptation.</p><p>5 0.13750221 <a title="39-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Cross-lingual_Projections_between_Languages_from_Different_Families.html">97 acl-2013-Cross-lingual Projections between Languages from Different Families</a></p>

However, these methods confronted the difficulty of syntactic differences between languages especially when the pair of languages varies greatly. To make the projection method well-generalize to diverse languages pairs, we enhance the projection method based on word alignments by introducing target-language word representations as features and proposing a novel noise removing method based on these word representations.

Within this context, we propose a new methodology that adapts the classical K-means algorithm to a third-order similarity measure initially developed for NLP tasks.

<p>Author: Young-Bum Kim ; Benjamin Snyder</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a solution to one aspect of the decipherment task: the prediction of consonants and vowels for an unknown language and alphabet. Adopting a classical Bayesian perspective, we performs posterior inference over hundreds of languages, leveraging knowledge of known languages and alphabets to uncover general linguistic patterns of typologically coherent language clusters. We achieve average accuracy in the unsupervised consonant/vowel prediction task of 99% across 503 languages. We further show that our methodology can be used to predict more fine-grained phonetic distinctions. On a three-way classification task between vowels, nasals, and nonnasal consonants, our model yields unsu- pervised accuracy of 89% across the same set of languages.</p><p>5 0.65948176 <a title="39-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-An_Information_Theoretic_Approach_to_Bilingual_Word_Clustering.html">47 acl-2013-An Information Theoretic Approach to Bilingual Word Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Manaal Faruqui ; Chris Dyer</p><p>Abstract: We present an information theoretic objective for bilingual word clustering that incorporates both monolingual distributional evidence as well as cross-lingual evidence from parallel corpora to learn high quality word clusters jointly in any number of languages. The monolingual component of our objective is the average mutual information of clusters of adjacent words in each language, while the bilingual component is the average mutual information of the aligned clusters. To evaluate our method, we use the word clusters in an NER system and demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in F1 score when using bilingual word clusters instead of monolingual clusters.</p><p>6 0.64076018 <a title="39-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Modeling_of_term-distance_and_term-occurrence_information_for_improving_n-gram_language_model_performance.html">247 acl-2013-Modeling of term-distance and term-occurrence information for improving n-gram language model performance</a></p>

Most existing approaches rely on the traditional vector space model. We propose an approach for recognizing identical real-world events based on a structured, event-oriented document representation. We structure documents as graphs of event mentions and use graph kernels to measure the similarity between document pairs. Our experiments indicate that the proposed graph-based approach can outperform the traditional vector space model, and is especially suitable for distinguishing between topically similar, yet non-identical events.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.83977306 <a title="39-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Addressing_Ambiguity_in_Unsupervised_Part-of-Speech_Induction_with_Substitute_Vectors.html">39 acl-2013-Addressing Ambiguity in Unsupervised Part-of-Speech Induction with Substitute Vectors</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiaodong Zeng ; Derek F. Wong ; Lidia S. Chao ; Isabel Trancoso</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a graph-based semisupervised joint model of Chinese word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging. The proposed approach is based on a graph-based label propagation technique. One constructs a nearest-neighbor similarity graph over all trigrams of labeled and unlabeled data for propagating syntactic information, i.e., label distributions. The derived label distributions are regarded as virtual evidences to regularize the learning of linear conditional random fields (CRFs) on unlabeled data. An inductive character-based joint model is obtained eventually. Empirical results on Chinese tree bank (CTB-7) and Microsoft Research corpora (MSR) reveal that the proposed model can yield better results than the supervised baselines and other competitive semi-supervised CRFs in this task.</p><p>5 0.80840003 <a title="39-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Robust_multilingual_statistical_morphological_generation_models.html">303 acl-2013-Robust multilingual statistical morphological generation models</a></p>

Our system uses a trainable classifier to predict “edit scripts” that are then used to transform lemmas into inflected word forms. Suffixes of lemmas are included as features to achieve robustness. We evaluate our system on 6 languages with a varying degree of morphological richness. The results show that the system is able to learn most morphological phenomena and generalize to unseen inputs, producing significantly better results than a dictionarybased baseline.</p><p>6 0.80764616 <a title="39-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Graph_Propagation_for_Paraphrasing_Out-of-Vocabulary_Words_in_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">174 acl-2013-Graph Propagation for Paraphrasing Out-of-Vocabulary Words in Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

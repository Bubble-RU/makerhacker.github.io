We translate the text summarization task into a problem of extracting a set of dependency subtrees in the document cluster. We also encode obligatory case constraints as must-link dependency constraints in order to guarantee the readability of the generated summary. In order to handle the subtree extraction problem, we investigate a new class of submodular maximization problem, and a new algorithm that has the approximation ratio 21 (1 − e−1).

<p>Author: Polina Kuznetsova ; Vicente Ordonez ; Alexander Berg ; Tamara Berg ; Yejin Choi</p><p>Abstract: The ever growing amount of web images and their associated texts offers new opportunities for integrative models bridging natural language processing and computer vision. However, the potential benefits of such data are yet to be fully realized due to the complexity and noise in the alignment between image content and text. We address this challenge with contributions in two folds: first, we introduce the new task of image caption generalization, formulated as visually-guided sentence compression, and present an efficient algorithm based on dynamic beam search with dependency-based constraints. Second, we release a new large-scale corpus with 1 million image-caption pairs achieving tighter content alignment between images and text. Evaluation results show the intrinsic quality of the generalized captions and the extrinsic utility of the new imagetext parallel corpus with respect to a concrete application of image caption transfer.</p><p>6 0.14636515 <a title="18-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-A_Decade_of_Automatic_Content_Evaluation_of_News_Summaries%3A_Reassessing_the_State_of_the_Art.html">5 acl-2013-A Decade of Automatic Content Evaluation of News Summaries: Reassessing the State of the Art</a></p>

<p>Author: Chen Li ; Xian Qian ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a bigram based supervised method for extractive document summarization in the integer linear programming (ILP) framework. For each bigram, a regression model is used to estimate its frequency in the reference summary. The regression model uses a variety ofindicative features and is trained discriminatively to minimize the distance between the estimated and the ground truth bigram frequency in the reference summary. During testing, the sentence selection problem is formulated as an ILP problem to maximize the bigram gains. We demonstrate that our system consistently outperforms the previous ILP method on different TAC data sets, and performs competitively compared to the best results in the TAC evaluations. We also conducted various analysis to show the impact of bigram selection, weight estimation, and ILP setup.</p><p>6 0.62941468 <a title="18-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Summarization_Through_Submodularity_and_Dispersion.html">333 acl-2013-Summarization Through Submodularity and Dispersion</a></p>

<p>Author: Preslav Nakov ; Francisco Guzman ; Stephan Vogel</p><p>Abstract: While experimenting with tuning on long sentences, we made an unexpected discovery: that PRO falls victim to monsters overly long negative examples with very low BLEU+1 scores, which are unsuitable for learning and can cause testing BLEU to drop by several points absolute. We propose several effective ways to address the problem, using length- and BLEU+1based cut-offs, outlier filters, stochastic sampling, and random acceptance. The best of these fixes not only slay and protect against monsters, but also yield higher stability for PRO as well as improved testtime BLEU scores. Thus, we recommend them to anybody using PRO, monsterbeliever or not. – 1 Once Upon a Time... For years, the standard way to do statistical machine translation parameter tuning has been to use minimum error-rate training, or MERT (Och, 2003). However, as researchers started using models with thousands of parameters, new scalable optimization algorithms such as MIRA (Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2008) and PRO (Hopkins and May, 2011) have emerged. As these algorithms are relatively new, they are still not quite well understood, and studying their properties is an active area of research. For example, Nakov et al. (2012) have pointed out that PRO tends to generate translations that are consistently shorter than desired. They have blamed this on inadequate smoothing in PRO’s optimization objective, namely sentencelevel BLEU+1, and they have addressed the problem using more sensible smoothing. We wondered whether the issue could be partially relieved simply by tuning on longer sentences, for which the effect of smoothing would naturally be smaller. To our surprise, tuning on the longer 50% of the tuning sentences had a disastrous effect on PRO, causing an absolute drop of three BLEU points on testing; at the same time, MERT and MIRA did not have such a problem. While investigating the reasons, we discovered hundreds of monsters creeping under PRO’s surface... Our tale continues as follows. We first explain what monsters are in Section 2, then we present a theory about how they can be slayed in Section 3, we put this theory to test in practice in Section 4, and we discuss some related efforts in Section 5. Finally, we present the moral of our tale, and we hint at some planned future battles in Section 6. 2 Monsters, Inc. PRO uses pairwise ranking optimization, where the learning task is to classify pairs of hypotheses into correctly or incorrectly ordered (Hopkins and May, 2011). It searches for a vector of weights w such that higher evaluation metric scores correspond to higher model scores and vice versa. More formally, PRO looks for weights w such that g(i, j) > g(i, j0) ⇔ hw (i, j) > hw (i, j0), where g is a local scoring fu hnction (typically, sentencelevel BLEU+1) and hw are the model scores for a given input sentence i and two candidate hypotheses j and j0 that were obtained using w. If g(i, j) > g(i, j0), we will refer to j and j0 as the positive and the negative example in the pair. Learning good parameter values requires negative examples that are comparable to the positive ones. Instead, tuning on long sentences quickly introduces monsters, i.e., corrupted negative examples that are unsuitable for learning: they are (i) much longer than the respective positive examples and the references, and (ii) have very low BLEU+1 scores compared to the positive examples and in absolute terms. The low BLEU+1 means that PRO effectively has to learn from positive examples only. 12 Proce dinSgosfi oa,f tB huel 5g1arsita, An Anu gauls Mt 4e-e9ti n2g01 o3f. th ?c e2 A0s1s3oc Aiastsio cnia fotiron C fo mrp Cuotmatpiounta tlio Lninaglu Li sntgicusi,s ptaicgses 12–17, Avg.

Table 1shows an optimization run of PRO when tuning on long sentences. We can see monsters after iterations in which positive examples are on average longer than negative ones (e.g., iter. 1). As a result, PRO learns to generate longer sentences, but it overshoots too much (iter. 2), which gives rise to monsters. Ideally, the learning algorithm should be able to recover from overshooting. However, once monsters are encountered, they quickly start dominating, with no chance for PRO to recover since it accumulates n-best lists, and thus also monsters, over iterations. As a result, PRO keeps jumping up and down and converges to random values, as Figure 1 shows. By default, PRO’s parameters are averaged over iterations, and thus the final result is quite mediocre, but selecting the highest tuning score does not solve the problem either: for example, on Figure 1, PRO never achieves a BLEU better than that for the default initialization parameters. iteration Figure 1: PRO tuning results on long sentences across iterations. The dark-gray line shows the tuning BLEU (left axis), the light-gray one is the hypothesis/reference length ratio (right axis). Figure 2 shows the translations after iterations 1, 3 and 4; the last two are monsters. The monster at iteration 3 is potentially useful, but that at iteration 4 is clearly unsuitable as a negative example.

We also checked whether other popular optimizers yield very low BLEU scores at test time when tuned on long sentences. Lines 2-3 in Table 2 show that this is not the case for MERT and MIRA. Since they optimize objectives that are different from PRO’s,1 we further experimented with plugging MIRA’s objective into PRO and PRO’s objective into MIRA. The resulting MIRA scores were not much different from before, while PRO’s score dropped even further; we also found mon- sters. Next, we applied the length fix for PRO proposed in (Nakov et al., 2012); this helped a bit, but still left PRO two BLEU points behind and MIRA, and the monsters did not go away. We can conclude that the monster problem is PRO-specific, cannot be blamed on the objective function, and is different from the length bias. Note also that monsters are not specific to a dataset or language pair. We found them when tuning on the top-50% of WMT10 and testing on WMT1 1 for Spanish-English; this yielded a drop in BLEU from 29.63 (1M2/emEs/RprTes)la to 27.12 n(inPg/RtmOp.)1.1 MERT2 **REF** : but we have to close ranks with each other and realize that in unity there is strength while in division there is weakness . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - **IT1** : but we are that we add our ranks to some of us and that we know that in the strength and weakness in **IT3** : , we are the but of the that that the , and , of ranks the the on the the our the our the some of we can include , and , of to the of we know the the our in of the of some people , force of the that that the in of the that that the the weakness Union the the , and **IT4** : namely Dr Heba Handossah and Dr Mona been pushed aside because a larger story EU Ambassador to Egypt Ian Burg highlighted 've dragged us backwards and dragged our speaking , never balme your defaulting a December 7th 1941 in Pearl Harbor ) we can include ranks will be joined by all 've dragged us backwards and dragged our $ 3 .8 billion in tourism income proceeds Chamber are divided among themselves : some ' ve dragged us backwards and dragged our were exaggerated .

Then, we propose various monster slaying techniques to be applied during PRO’s selection and acceptance steps. 3.1 What is PRO? PRO is a batch optimizer that iterates between (i) translation: using the current parameter values, generate k-best translations, and (ii) optimization: using the translations from all previous iterations, find new parameter values. The optimization step has four substeps: 1. Sampling: For each sentence, sample uniformly at random Γ = 5000 pairs from the set of all candidate translations for that sentence from all previous iterations. 2. Selection: From these sampled pairs, select those for which the absolute difference between their BLEU+1 scores is higher than α = 0.05 (note: this is 5 BLEU+1 points). 3. Acceptance: For each sentence, accept the Ξ = 50 selected pairs with the highest absolute difference in their BLEU+1 scores. 4. Learning: Assemble the accepted pairs for all sentences into a single set and use it to train a ranker to prefer the higher-scoring sentence in each pair. We believe that monsters are nurtured by PRO’s selection and acceptance policies. PRO’s selection step filters pairs involving hypotheses that differ by less than five BLEU+1 points, but it does not cut-off ones that differ too much based on BLEU+1 or length. PRO’s acceptance step selects Ξ = 50 pairs with the highest BLEU+1 differentials, which creates breeding ground for monsters since these pairs are very likely to include one monster and one good hypothesis. Below we discuss monster slaying geared towards the selection and acceptance steps of PRO. 3.2 Slaying at Selection In the selection step, PRO filters pairs for which the difference in BLEU+1 is less than five points, but it has no cut-off on the maximum BLEU+1 differentials nor cut-offs based on absolute length or difference in length. Here, we propose several selection filters, both deterministic and probabilistic. Cut-offs. A cut-off is a deterministic rule that filters out pairs that do not comply with some criteria. We experiment with a maximal cut-off on (a) the difference in BLEU+1 scores and (b) the difference in lengths. These are relative cut-offs because they refer to the pair, but absolute cut-offs that apply to each of the elements in the pair are also possible (not explored here). Cut-offs (a) and (b) slay monsters by not allowing the negative examples to get much worse in BLEU+1 or in length than the positive example in the pair. Filtering outliers. Outliers are rare or extreme observations in a sample. We assume normal distribution of the BLEU+1 scores (or of the lengths) of the translation hypotheses for the same source sentence, and we define as outliers hypotheses whose BLEU+1 (or length) is more than λ standard deviations away from the sample average. We apply the outlier filter to both the positive and the negative example in a pair, but it is more important for the latter. We experiment with values of λ like 2 and 3. This filtering slays monsters because they are likely outliers. However, it will not work if the population gets riddled with monsters, in which case they would become the norm. Stochastic sampling. Instead of filtering extreme examples, we can randomly sample pairs according to their probability of being typical. Let us assume that the values of the local scoring functions, i.e., the BLEU+1 scores, are distributed nor- mally: g(i, j) ∼ N(µ, σ2). Given a sample of hypothesis (tira,nj)sl ∼atio Nn(sµ {j} of the same source sentpeontchee i, we can ensstim {ja}te o σ empirically. Then, the difference ∆ = g(i, j) − g(i, j0) would be tdhisetr diibfufteerde normally w gi(thi, mean zero and variance 2σ2. Now, given a pair of examples, we can calculate their ∆, and we can choose to select the pair with some probability, according to N(0, 2σ2). 3.3 Slaying at Acceptance Another problem is caused by the acceptance mechanism of PRO: among all selected pairs, it accepts the top-Ξ with the highest BLEU+1 differentials. It is easy to see that these differentials are highest for nonmonster–monster pairs if such pairs exist. One way to avoid focusing primarily on such pairs is to accept a random set of pairs, among the ones that survived the selection step. One possible caveat is that we can lose some of the discriminative power of PRO by focusing on examples that are not different enough. Ξ 14 TESTING TUNING (run 1, it. 25, avg.)

A dagger (†) indicates selection fixes that successfully get rid of monsters. 4 Attacking Monsters: Practice Below, we first present our general experimental setup. Then, we present the results for the various selection alternatives, both with the original acceptance strategy and with random acceptance. 4.1 Experimental Setup We used a phrase-based SMT model (Koehn et al., 2003) as implemented in the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007). We trained on all Arabic-English data for NIST 2012 except for UN, we tuned on (the longest-50% of) the MT06 sentences, and we tested on MT09. We used the MADA ATB segmentation for Arabic (Roth et al., 2008) and truecasing for English, phrases of maximal length 7, Kneser-Ney smoothing, and lexicalized reorder- ing (Koehn et al., 2005), and a 5-gram language model, trained on GigaWord v.5 using KenLM (Heafield, 2011). We dropped unknown words both at tuning and testing, and we used minimum Bayes risk decoding at testing (Kumar and Byrne, 2004). We evaluated the output with NIST’s scoring tool v.13a, cased. We used the Moses implementations of MERT, PRO and batch MIRA, with the –return-best-dev parameter for the latter. We ran these optimizers for up to 25 iterations and we used 1000-best lists. For stability (Foster and Kuhn, 2009), we performed three reruns of each experiment (tuning + evaluation), and we report averaged scores. 4.2 Selection Alternatives Table 3 presents the results for different selection alternatives. The first two columns show the testing results: average BLEU and standard deviation over three reruns. The following five columns show statistics about the last iteration (it. 25) of PRO’s tuning for the worst rerun: average lengths of the positive and the negative examples and average effective reference length, followed by average BLEU+1 scores for the positive and the negative examples in the pairs. The last two columns present the results when tuning on the full tuning set. These are included to verify the behavior of PRO in a nonmonster prone environment. We can see in Table 3 that all selection mechanisms considerably improve BLEU compared to the baseline PRO, by 2-3 BLEU points. However, not every selection alternative gets rid of monsters, which can be seen by the large lengths and low BLEU+1 for the negative examples (in bold). The max cut-offs for BLEU+1 and for lengths both slay the monsters, but the latter yields much lower standard deviation (thirteen times lower than for the baseline PRO!), thus considerably increasing PRO’s stability. On the full dataset, BLEU scores are about the same as for the original PRO (with small improvement for BLEU+1 max=20), but the standard deviations are slightly better. Rejecting outliers using BLEU+1 and λ = 3 is not strong enough to filter out monsters, but making this criterion more strict by setting λ = 2, yields competitive BLEU and kills the monsters. Rejecting outliers based on length does not work as effectively though. We can think of two possible reasons: (i) lengths are not normally distributed, they are more Poisson-like, and (ii) the acceptance criterion is based on the top-Ξ differentials based on BLEU+1, not based on length. On the full dataset, rejecting outliers, BLEU+1 and length, yields lower BLEU and less stability. 15 TESTING TUNING (run 1, it. 25, avg.)

The (††) indicates that random acceptance kills monsters. The asterisk (∗) indicates improved stability over random acceptance. Reasons (i) and (ii) arguably also apply to stochastic sampling of differentials (for BLEU+1 or for length), which fails to kill the monsters, maybe because it gives them some probability of being selected by design. To alleviate this, we test the above settings with random acceptance. 4.3 Random Acceptance Table 4 shows the results for accepting training pairs for PRO uniformly at random. To eliminate possible biases, we also removed the min=0.05 BLEU+1 selection criterion. Surprisingly, this setup effectively eliminated the monster problem. Further coupling this with the distributional criteria can also yield increased stability, and even small further increase in test BLEU. For instance, rejecting BLEU outliers with λ = 2 yields comparable average test BLEU, but with only half the standard deviation. On the other hand, using the stochastic sampling of differentials based on either BLEU+1 or lengths improves the test BLEU score while increasing the stability across runs. The random acceptance has a caveat though: it generally decreases the discriminative power of PRO, yielding worse results when tuning on the full, nonmonster prone tuning dataset. Stochastic selection does help to alleviate this problem. Yet, the results are not as good as when using a max cut-off for the length. Therefore, we recommend using the latter as a default setting. 5 Related Work We are not aware of previous work that discusses the issue of monsters, but there has been work on a different, length problem with PRO (Nakov et al., 2012). We have seen that its solution, fix the smoothing in BLEU+1, did not work for us. The stability of MERT has been improved using regularization (Cer et al., 2008), random restarts (Moore and Quirk, 2008), multiple replications (Clark et al., 2011), and parameter aggregation (Cettolo et al., 2011). With the emergence of new optimization techniques, there have been studies that compare stability between MIRA–MERT (Chiang et al., 2008; Chiang et al., 2009; Cherry and Foster, 2012), PRO–MERT (Hopkins and May, 2011), MIRA– PRO–MERT (Cherry and Foster, 2012; Gimpel and Smith, 2012; Nakov et al., 2012). Pathological verbosity can be an issue when tuning MERT on recall-oriented metrics such as METEOR (Lavie and Denkowski, 2009; Denkowski and Lavie, 2011). Large variance between the results obtained with MIRA has also been reported (Simianer et al., 2012). However, none of this work has focused on monsters. 6 Tale’s Moral and Future Battles We have studied a problem with PRO, namely that it can fall victim to monsters, overly long negative examples with very low BLEU+1 scores, which are unsuitable for learning. We have proposed several effective ways to address this problem, based on length- and BLEU+1-based cut-offs, outlier filters and stochastic sampling. The best of these fixes have not only slayed the monsters, but have also brought much higher stability to PRO as well as improved test-time BLEU scores. These benefits are less visible on the full dataset, but we still recommend them to everybody who uses PRO as protection against monsters. Monsters are inherent in PRO; they just do not always take over. In future work, we plan a deeper look at the mechanism of monster creation in PRO and its possible connection to PRO’s length bias. 16 References Daniel Cer, Daniel Jurafsky, and Christopher Manning. 2008.

In this paper we propose a discriminative learning algorithm to take advantage of the linguistic knowledge in large amounts of natural annotations on the Internet. It utilizes the Internet as an external corpus with massive (although slight and sparse) natural annotations, and enables a classifier to evolve on the large-scaled and real-time updated web text. With Chinese word segmentation as a case study, experiments show that the segmenter enhanced with the Chinese wikipedia achieves sig- nificant improvement on a series of testing sets from different domains, even with a single classifier and local features.</p><p>4 0.8087787 <a title="18-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Easy-First_POS_Tagging_and_Dependency_Parsing_with_Beam_Search.html">132 acl-2013-Easy-First POS Tagging and Dependency Parsing with Beam Search</a></p>

We propose a simple variant of “early-update” to ensure valid update in the training process. The proposed solution can also be applied to combine beam search and structured perceptron with other systems that exhibit spurious ambiguity. On CTB, we achieve 94.01% tagging accuracy and 86.33% unlabeled attachment score with a relatively small beam width.

<p>Author: Jinho D.

Selectional branching is guaranteed to perform a fewer number of transitions than beam search yet performs as accurately. We also present a new transition-based dependency parsing algorithm that gives a complexity of O(n) for projective parsing and an expected linear time speed for non-projective parsing. With the standard setup, our parser shows an unlabeled attachment score of 92.96% and a parsing speed of 9 milliseconds per sentence, which is faster and more accurate than the current state-of-the-art transitionbased parser that uses beam search.</p><p>6 0.80794305 <a title="18-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-A_Shift-Reduce_Parsing_Algorithm_for_Phrase-based_String-to-Dependency_Translation.html">19 acl-2013-A Shift-Reduce Parsing Algorithm for Phrase-based String-to-Dependency Translation</a></p>

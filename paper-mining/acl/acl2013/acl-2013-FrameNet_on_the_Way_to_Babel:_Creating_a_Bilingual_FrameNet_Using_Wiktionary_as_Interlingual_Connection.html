</p><p>2 We perform a detailed evaluation of the created resource and a discussion of Wiktionary as an interlingual connection for the cross-language transfer of lexicalsemantic resources. [sent-7, score-0.261]
</p><p>3 Previous cross-lingual transfer of FrameNet used corpus-based approaches, or resource alignment with multilingual expert-built resources, such as EuroWordNet. [sent-15, score-0.208]
</p><p>4 Recently, collaboratively created resources have been investigated for the multilingual extension of resources in NLP, beginning with Wikipedia (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010). [sent-17, score-0.234]
</p><p>5 For FrameNet, information on the predicates associated with a semantic frame mostly verbs, nouns, and adjectives is crucial, for instance gloss or syntactic subcategorization. [sent-24, score-0.272]
</p><p>6 A solution for the problem of multilingual extension of lexical semantic resources is to use Wiktionary, a collaboratively created dictionary, as connection between languages. [sent-25, score-0.212]
</p><p>7 , how alignment algorithms can be adapted to individual resource pairs and different POS, is essential for their effective use in NLP and a prerequisite for later in-task evaluation and application. [sent-33, score-0.167]
</p><p>8 To enhance this understanding for the presented resource pair, we perform a detailed analysis of the created resource and compare it to existing FrameNet resources for German. [sent-34, score-0.23]
</p><p>9 Ac s2s0o1ci3a Atiosnso fcoirat Cio nm foprut Caotimonpaulta Lti nognuails Lti cnsg,u piasgteics 1363–1373, The contributions of our work are the following: (1) We create a novel sense alignment between FrameNet and the English Wiktionary. [sent-37, score-0.242]
</p><p>10 It results  in a multilingual FrameNet FNWKxx, which links FrameNet senses to lemmas in 280 languages. [sent-38, score-0.361]
</p><p>11 It groups word senses in frames that represent particular situations. [sent-44, score-0.409]
</p><p>12 In the first step, we create a novel sense  alignment between FrameNet and the English Wiktionary following Niemann and Gurevych (201 1). [sent-69, score-0.242]
</p><p>13 Thus, the FrameNet sense of to complete with frame Activity finish is assigned to the sense of to complete in Wiktionary meaning to finish. [sent-70, score-0.455]
</p><p>14 This step establishes Wiktionary as an interlingual index between FrameNet senses and lemmas in many languages, and builds the foundation for the bilingual FrameNet extension. [sent-71, score-0.44]
</p><p>15 It results in a basic multilingual FrameNet lexicon FNWKxx with translations to lemmas in 283 languages. [sent-72, score-0.164]
</p><p>16 An example: by aligning the FrameNet sense of the verb complete with gloss to finish with the corresponding English Wiktionary sense, we collect 39 translations to 22 languages, e. [sent-73, score-0.349]
</p><p>17 The second step is the disambiguation of the translated lemmas with respect to the target language Wiktionary in order to retrieve the linguistic information of the corresponding word sense in the target language Wiktionary (Meyer and Gurevych, 2012a). [sent-76, score-0.284]
</p><p>18 For the example sense of complete, we extract lexical information for the word sense of its German translation fertigmachen, for instance a German gloss, an example sentence, register information (colloquial), and synonyms, e. [sent-78, score-0.286]
</p><p>19 The first, corpus-based approach is to automatically extract word senses in the target language based on parallel corpora and frame annotations in the source language. [sent-84, score-0.466]
</p><p>20 Pad o´ and Lapata (2005) observe that their approach suffers from polysemy errors, because lemmas in the source language need to be disambiguated with respect to all the frames they evoke. [sent-87, score-0.199]
</p><p>21 Our approach is based on sense alignments and therefore explicitly aims to avoid such errors. [sent-90, score-0.158]
</p><p>22 The second line of work is resource-based: FrameNet is aligned to multilingual resources in order to extract senses in the target language. [sent-91, score-0.434]
</p><p>23 (2008) map FrameNet frames to WordNet synsets based on the embedding of FrameNet lemmas in WordNet. [sent-95, score-0.208]
</p><p>24 To create MapNet, Tonelli and Pianta (2009)  align FrameNet senses with WordNet synsets by exploiting the textual similarity of their glosses. [sent-97, score-0.331]
</p><p>25 The similarity measure is based on stem overlap of the candidates’ glosses expanded by WordNet domains, the WordNet synset, and the set of senses for a FrameNet frame. [sent-98, score-0.392]
</p><p>26 They report 4,265 new English senses and 6,429 new Italian senses, which were derived via MultiWordNet. [sent-101, score-0.277]
</p><p>27 ExtendedWordFramenet (Laparra and Rigau, 2009; Laparra and Rigau, 2010) is also based on the alignment of FrameNet senses to WordNet synsets. [sent-102, score-0.369]
</p><p>28 For each language, they add more then 10,000 senses to FrameNet. [sent-104, score-0.277]
</p><p>29 They rely on a knowledge-based word sense disambiguation algorithm to establish the alignment  and report F1=0. [sent-105, score-0.271]
</p><p>30 Tonelli and Giuliano (2009) align FrameNet senses to Wikipedia entries with the goal to extract word senses and example sentences in Italian. [sent-107, score-0.579]
</p><p>31 They match the FrameNet senses to Wiktionary lexical entries, thus encountering the problem of polysemy in the target language. [sent-116, score-0.332]
</p><p>32 2  Wiktionary Sense Alignments  Collaboratively created resources have become popular for sense alignments for NLP, starting with the alignment between WordNet and Wikipedia (Ruiz-Casado et al. [sent-123, score-0.33]
</p><p>33 Meyer and Gurevych (201 1) map WordNet synsets to Wiktionary senses and show their complementary domain coverage. [sent-126, score-0.31]
</p><p>34 1 Alignment Technique  We follow the state-of-the-art sense alignment technique introduced by Niemann and Gurevych (201 1). [sent-128, score-0.221]
</p><p>35 They align senses in WordNet to Wikipedia entries in a supervised setting using semantic similarity measures. [sent-129, score-0.302]
</p><p>36 This is crucial for obtaining a high-quality alignment of heterogeneous resources, such as the presented one, because their sense granularity and coverage can diverge a lot. [sent-131, score-0.243]
</p><p>37 In the candidate extraction step, we iterate over all FrameNet senses and match them with all senses from Wiktionary which have the same lemma and thus are likely to describe the same sense. [sent-133, score-0.614]
</p><p>38 This step yields a set of candidate sense pairs Call. [sent-134, score-0.155]
</p><p>39 In the classification step, a similarity score between the textual information associated with the senses in a candidate pair (e. [sent-135, score-0.303]
</p><p>40 The PPR measure (Agirre and Soroa, 2009) maps the glosses of the two senses to a semantic vector space spanned up by WordNet synsets and then compares them using the chi-square measure. [sent-139, score-0.4]
</p><p>41 The semantic vectors ppr are computed using the personalized PageRank algorithm on the WordNet graph. [sent-140, score-0.172]
</p><p>42 2 Candidate Extraction To compile the candidate set, we paired senses from both resources with identical lemma-POS combinations. [sent-150, score-0.358]
</p><p>43 FrameNet senses are defined by a lemma, a gloss, and a frame. [sent-151, score-0.277]
</p><p>44 Wiktionary senses  are defined by a lemma and a gloss. [sent-152, score-0.311]
</p><p>45 For the FrameNet sense Activity finish of the verb complete, we find two candidate senses in Wiktionary (to finish and to make whole). [sent-153, score-0.532]
</p><p>46 The full candidate set Call contains over 44,000 sense pairs and covers 97% of the 11,942 FrameNet senses. [sent-156, score-0.177]
</p><p>47 This ensures that highly polysemous words as well as words with few senses are selected. [sent-160, score-0.277]
</p><p>48 The annotation task consisted in a two-class annotation: Do the presented senses have same meaning - (YES/NO). [sent-162, score-0.277]
</p><p>49 The verb senses are very fine-grained and thus present a difficult alignment task. [sent-181, score-0.391]
</p><p>50 After removing the training set for the raters, the final gold standard contains 2,789 sense pairs. [sent-183, score-0.175]
</p><p>51 For FrameNet senses, we used the lemma-pos, sense gloss, example sentences, frame name and frame definition as textual features; for Wiktionary senses, we considered lemma-pos, sense gloss, example sentences, hyponyms and synonyms. [sent-188, score-0.597]
</p><p>52 Adding the frame name and frame definition to the often short glosses provides a richer sense representation for the COS measure. [sent-263, score-0.535]
</p><p>53 The best-performing PPR configuration uses sense gloss and lemma-pos. [sent-264, score-0.215]
</p><p>54 For the joint model, we employed the best single PPR configuration, and a COS configuration that uses sense gloss extended by Wiktionary hypernyms, synonyms and FrameNet frame name and frame definition, to achieve the highest score, an F1-score of 0. [sent-265, score-0.554]
</p><p>55 5 Gold Standard Evaluation We compared the performance of our alignment  on the gold standard to a baseline which randomly selects one target sense from the candidate set of each source sense (Random-1). [sent-268, score-0.453]
</p><p>56 It is guided by the heuristic that more frequent senses are listed first in Wiktionary (Meyer and Gurevych, 2010). [sent-270, score-0.277]
</p><p>57 This is in line with the reported higher complexity of lexical resources with respect to verbs and greater difficulty in alignments and word sense disambiguation (Laparra and Rigau, 2010). [sent-280, score-0.285]
</p><p>58 Aligning senses with such glosses is difficult for a system based on semantic similarity. [sent-290, score-0.367]
</p><p>59 enlarge: make large) were explicitly stressed in the definitions and thus annotated as different senses by the annotators. [sent-294, score-0.277]
</p><p>60 The first meaning of enlarge belongs to the frame Expansion, the second to Cause expansion. [sent-296, score-0.18]
</p><p>61 It connects more than 9,800 unique FrameNet senses with more than 10,000 unique Wiktionary senses, which shows that both non-alignments and multiple alignments occur for some source senses. [sent-311, score-0.306]
</p><p>62 In order to verify the quality of the alignment, we performed a detailed post-hoc analysis on a sample of 270 aligned sense pairs  randomly drawn from the set of aligned senses. [sent-314, score-0.189]
</p><p>63 Because sense granularity was an issue in the error analysis, we considered two alignment decisions: (a) fine-grained alignment: the two glosses describe the same sense; (b) coarse-grained alignment. [sent-315, score-0.333]
</p><p>64 3 Resource Analysis For each of the aligned senses in the 12,094 aligned sense pairs, we extracted glosses from Wiktionary. [sent-328, score-0.556]
</p><p>65 Because FrameNet glosses are often very brief, the additional glosses will benefit algorithms such as frame detection for SRL. [sent-329, score-0.338]
</p><p>66 We can extract 2,15 1 new lemma-POS for FrameNet frames from the synonyms of the aligned senses in Wiktionary. [sent-331, score-0.462]
</p><p>67 This step establishes Wiktionary as an interlingual connection between FrameNet and a large number of languages, including low-resource ones: via Wiktionary, we connect FrameNet senses to translations in 283 languages, e. [sent-333, score-0.454]
</p><p>68 , we translate the sense of the verb complete associ-  ated with the frame Activity Finish to the German colloquial fertigmachen, the Spanish terminar, the Turkish tamamlamak, and 19 other languages. [sent-335, score-0.336]
</p><p>69 We use the sense-disambiguated Wiktionary resulting from a recently published approach for the disambiguation of relations and translations in Wiktionary (Meyer and Gurevych, 2012a) to create our new bilingual (German-English) FrameNet lexicon FNWKde. [sent-346, score-0.178]
</p><p>70 Their approach combines information on the source sense and all potential target senses in order to determine the best target sense in a rule-based disambiguation strategy. [sent-347, score-0.647]
</p><p>71 The information is encoded as binary features, which are ordered in a back-off hierarchy: if the first feature applies, the target sense is selected, otherwise the second feature is considered, and so forth. [sent-348, score-0.16]
</p><p>72 , the source lemma occurs on the translation list of the target sense); relation overlap; Lesk measure between original and translated glosses in source and target language; and finally, backing off to the first target sense. [sent-354, score-0.217]
</p><p>73 We use the latter to identify target senses of synonyms in FNWKxx. [sent-358, score-0.331]
</p><p>74 It contains 5,897 pairs of German Wiktionary senses and FrameNet senses, i. [sent-361, score-0.277]
</p><p>75 The number of Wiktionary senses aligned to FrameNet senses is increased by 50%. [sent-367, score-0.584]
</p><p>76 We will discuss whether and how they can be integrated as FrameNet senses in our resource below. [sent-371, score-0.352]
</p><p>77 There are 115 senses associated with these frames in our resource. [sent-376, score-0.409]
</p><p>78 For 17 of the evaluated sense pairs, redundancy confirms their quality: they were obtained indepen-  dently by two or three alignment-and-translation paths and do not contain alignment errors. [sent-380, score-0.221]
</p><p>79 The automatically developed resources, including FNWKde, provide a larger number of senses than SALSA. [sent-386, score-0.277]
</p><p>80 The annotated corpora contain a large number of examples, but they do not provide any glosses, which are useful for frame detection in SRL, nor do they contain any other lexicalsemantic information. [sent-387, score-0.193]
</p><p>81 The numbers on frame overlap show that our resource covers the frames in the other  senses3  3Note that the senses in SALSA and P&L05; are defined by frame, lemma, and POS. [sent-391, score-0.689]
</p><p>82 In Table 6, FNWKde senses with identical frame, lemma, and POS, but different gloss are therefore conflated to one sense. [sent-392, score-0.363]
</p><p>83 resources well (89% and 90% coverage respectively), and that it adds frames not covered in the other resources: P&L05; only covers 55% of the frames in FNWKde. [sent-394, score-0.341]
</p><p>84 The sense overlap shows that the resources have senses in common, which  confirms the quality of the automatically developed resources, but they also complement each other. [sent-395, score-0.486]
</p><p>85 The approach is in theory applicable to any language, but there are some obstacles: first, it relies on the availability of the target sense in the target language Wiktionary. [sent-401, score-0.191]
</p><p>86 For languages, where such a tool is not available, we could default to the first-sense-heuristic, or encourage the Wiktionary community to link the translations to their target Wiktionary senses inspired by Sajous et al. [sent-405, score-0.359]
</p><p>87 Boas (2005) reports that, while many frames are largely 4see  overview table at tu-darmst adt . [sent-408, score-0.164]
</p><p>88 Also, fine-grained sense and frame distinctions may be more relevant in one language than in another  language. [sent-413, score-0.287]
</p><p>89 The quality of the multilingual FNWKxx depends on i) the translations in the interlingual connection Wiktionary, which are manually created, controlled by the community, and therefore reliable, and ii) on the FrameNet–Wiktionary alignment. [sent-418, score-0.218]
</p><p>90 Therefore, we evaluated our sense alignment method in detail. [sent-419, score-0.221]
</p><p>91 The post-hoc analysis raised the question of  FrameNet frame granularity. [sent-423, score-0.158]
</p><p>92 Do separate frames exist for causative/inchoative alternations (as Being dry and Cause to be dry for to dry), or do they belong to the same frame (Make noise for to creak and to creak something)? [sent-424, score-0.398]
</p><p>93 Alternatively, we could map Wiktionary senses directly to frames, and include features that cover the granularity distinctions, e. [sent-426, score-0.299]
</p><p>94 , whether the existing senses of a frame show the semantic alternation. [sent-428, score-0.435]
</p><p>95 We could use the same approach to assign senses to a frame which are derived via sense relations other than synonymy, i. [sent-429, score-0.564]
</p><p>96 We present a simple, but effective approach to solve this problem using the English Wiktionary as an interlingual representation and subsequent translation disambiguation in the target language. [sent-440, score-0.174]
</p><p>97 As part of this work, we created the first sense alignment between FrameNet and the English Wiktionary. [sent-442, score-0.246]
</p><p>98 The resulting resource FNWKxx con-  nects FrameNet senses to over 280 languages. [sent-443, score-0.352]
</p><p>99 We also extended FrameNet by several thousand new English senses from Wiktionary which are provided as part of FNWKde. [sent-450, score-0.277]

<p>Author: Mohammad Taher Pilehvar ; David Jurgens ; Roberto Navigli</p><p>Abstract: Semantic similarity is an essential component of many Natural Language Processing applications. However, prior methods for computing semantic similarity often operate at different levels, e.g., single words or entire documents, which requires adapting the method for each data type. We present a unified approach to semantic similarity that operates at multiple levels, all the way from comparing word senses to comparing text documents. Our method leverages a common probabilistic representation over word senses in order to compare different types of linguistic data. This unified representation shows state-ofthe-art performance on three tasks: seman- tic textual similarity, word similarity, and word sense coarsening.</p><p>5 0.12793033 <a title="162-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-DKPro_WSD%3A_A_Generalized_UIMA-based_Framework_for_Word_Sense_Disambiguation.html">105 acl-2013-DKPro WSD: A Generalized UIMA-based Framework for Word Sense Disambiguation</a></p>
<p>Author: Tristan Miller ; Nicolai Erbs ; Hans-Peter Zorn ; Torsten Zesch ; Iryna Gurevych</p><p>Abstract: Implementations of word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithms tend to be tied to a particular test corpus format and sense inventory. This makes it difficult to test their performance on new data sets, or to compare them against past algorithms implemented for different data sets. In this paper we present DKPro WSD, a freely licensed, general-purpose framework for WSD which is both modular and extensible. DKPro WSD abstracts the WSD process in such a way that test corpora, sense inventories, and algorithms can be freely swapped. Its UIMA-based architecture makes it easy to add support for new resources and algorithms. Related tasks such as word sense induction and entity linking are also supported.</p><p>6 0.12174355 <a title="162-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Neighbors_Help%3A_Bilingual_Unsupervised_WSD_Using_Context.html">258 acl-2013-Neighbors Help: Bilingual Unsupervised WSD Using Context</a></p>

<p>Author: Silvana Hartmann ; Iryna Gurevych</p><p>Abstract: We present a new bilingual FrameNet lexicon for English and German. It is created through a simple, but powerful approach to construct a FrameNet in any language using Wiktionary as an interlingual representation. Our approach is based on a sense alignment of FrameNet and Wiktionary, and subsequent translation disambiguation into the target language. We perform a detailed evaluation of the created resource and a discussion of Wiktionary as an interlingual connection for the cross-language transfer of lexicalsemantic resources.

We compare two approaches: the first one is the standard annotation methodology of lexical units and frame elements in two steps, while the second is a novel approach aimed at acquiring frames in a bottom-up fashion, starting from frame element annotation. We show that our methodology, relying on a single annotation step and on simplified role definitions, outperforms the standard one both in terms of accuracy and time.</p><p>4 0.61653835 <a title="162-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Neighbors_Help%3A_Bilingual_Unsupervised_WSD_Using_Context.html">258 acl-2013-Neighbors Help: Bilingual Unsupervised WSD Using Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Sudha Bhingardive ; Samiulla Shaikh ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is one of the toughest problems in NLP, and in WSD, verb disambiguation has proved to be extremely difficult, because of high degree of polysemy, too fine grained senses, absence of deep verb hierarchy and low inter annotator agreement in verb sense annotation. Unsupervised WSD has received widespread attention, but has performed poorly, specially on verbs. Recently an unsupervised bilingual EM based algorithm has been proposed, which makes use only of the raw counts of the translations in comparable corpora (Marathi and Hindi). But the performance of this approach is poor on verbs with accuracy level at 25-38%. We suggest a modifica- tion to this mentioned formulation, using context and semantic relatedness of neighboring words. An improvement of 17% 35% in the accuracy of verb WSD is obtained compared to the existing EM based approach. On a general note, the work can be looked upon as contributing to the framework of unsupervised WSD through context aware expectation maximization.</p><p>5 0.61365205 <a title="162-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Understanding_Verbs_based_on_Overlapping_Verbs_Senses.html">366 acl-2013-Understanding Verbs based on Overlapping Verbs Senses</a></p>
<p>Author: Kavitha Rajan</p><p>Abstract: Natural language can be easily understood by everyone irrespective of their differences in age or region or qualification. The existence of a conceptual base that underlies all natural languages is an accepted claim as pointed out by Schank in his Conceptual Dependency (CD) theory. Inspired by the CD theory and theories in Indian grammatical tradition, we propose a new set of meaning primitives in this paper. We claim that this new set of primitives captures the meaning inherent in verbs and help in forming an inter-lingual and computable ontological classification of verbs. We have identified seven primitive overlapping verb senses which substantiate our claim. The percentage of coverage of these primitives is 100% for all verbs in Sanskrit and Hindi and 3750 verbs in English. 1</p><p>6 0.61346614 <a title="162-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-IndoNet%3A_A_Multilingual_Lexical_Knowledge_Network_for_Indian_Languages.html">198 acl-2013-IndoNet: A Multilingual Lexical Knowledge Network for Indian Languages</a></p>

<p>Author: Chi-kiu Lo ; Karteek Addanki ; Markus Saers ; Dekai Wu</p><p>Abstract: We present the first ever results showing that tuning a machine translation system against a semantic frame based objective function, MEANT, produces more robustly adequate translations than tuning against BLEU or TER as measured across commonly used metrics and human subjective evaluation. Moreover, for informal web forum data, human evaluators preferred MEANT-tuned systems over BLEU- or TER-tuned systems by a significantly wider margin than that for formal newswire—even though automatic semantic parsing might be expected to fare worse on informal language. We argue thatbypreserving the meaning ofthe trans- lations as captured by semantic frames right in the training process, an MT system is constrained to make more accurate choices of both lexical and reordering rules. As a result, MT systems tuned against semantic frame based MT evaluation metrics produce output that is more adequate. Tuning a machine translation system against a semantic frame based objective function is independent ofthe translation model paradigm, so, any translation model can benefit from the semantic knowledge incorporated to improve translation adequacy through our approach.</p><p>2 0.99026555 <a title="162-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Named_Entity_Recognition_using_Cross-lingual_Resources%3A_Arabic_as_an_Example.html">256 acl-2013-Named Entity Recognition using Cross-lingual Resources: Arabic as an Example</a></p>
<p>Author: Kareem Darwish</p><p>Abstract: Some languages lack large knowledge bases and good discriminative features for Name Entity Recognition (NER) that can generalize to previously unseen named entities. One such language is Arabic, which: a) lacks a capitalization feature; and b) has relatively small knowledge bases, such as Wikipedia. In this work we address both problems by incorporating cross-lingual features and knowledge bases from English using cross-lingual links. We show that such features have a dramatic positive effect on recall. We show the effectiveness of cross-lingual features and resources on a standard dataset as well as on two new test sets that cover both news and microblogs. On the standard dataset, we achieved a 4.1% relative improvement in Fmeasure over the best reported result in the literature. The features led to improvements of 17.1% and 20.5% on the new news and mi- croblogs test sets respectively.</p><p>3 0.98978537 <a title="162-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Translating_Dialectal_Arabic_to_English.html">359 acl-2013-Translating Dialectal Arabic to English</a></p>
<p>Author: Hassan Sajjad ; Kareem Darwish ; Yonatan Belinkov</p><p>Abstract: We present a dialectal Egyptian Arabic to English statistical machine translation system that leverages dialectal to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) adaptation. In contrast to previous work, we first narrow down the gap between Egyptian and MSA by applying an automatic characterlevel transformational model that changes Egyptian to EG0, which looks similar to MSA. The transformations include morphological, phonological and spelling changes. The transformation reduces the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words from 5.2% to 2.6% and gives a gain of 1.87 BLEU points. Further, adapting large MSA/English parallel data increases the lexical coverage, reduces OOVs to 0.7% and leads to an absolute BLEU improvement of 2.73 points.</p><p>4 0.98860306 <a title="162-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Syntactic_Patterns_versus_Word_Alignment%3A_Extracting_Opinion_Targets_from_Online_Reviews.html">336 acl-2013-Syntactic Patterns versus Word Alignment: Extracting Opinion Targets from Online Reviews</a></p>
<p>Author: Kang Liu ; Liheng Xu ; Jun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: Mining opinion targets is a fundamental and important task for opinion mining from online reviews. To this end, there are usually two kinds of methods: syntax based and alignment based methods. Syntax based methods usually exploited syntactic patterns to extract opinion targets, which were however prone to suffer from parsing errors when dealing with online informal texts. In contrast, alignment based methods used word alignment model to fulfill this task, which could avoid parsing errors without using parsing. However, there is no research focusing on which kind of method is more better when given a certain amount of reviews. To fill this gap, this paper empiri- cally studies how the performance of these two kinds of methods vary when changing the size, domain and language of the corpus. We further combine syntactic patterns with alignment model by using a partially supervised framework and investigate whether this combination is useful or not. In our experiments, we verify that our combination is effective on the corpus with small and medium size.</p><p>5 0.98662496 <a title="162-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Latent_Semantic_Matching%3A_Application_to_Cross-language_Text_Categorization_without_Alignment_Information.html">217 acl-2013-Latent Semantic Matching: Application to Cross-language Text Categorization without Alignment Information</a></p>
<p>Author: Tsutomu Hirao ; Tomoharu Iwata ; Masaaki Nagata</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised object matching (UOM) is a promising approach to cross-language natural language processing such as bilingual lexicon acquisition, parallel corpus construction, and cross-language text categorization, because it does not require labor-intensive linguistic resources. However, UOM only finds one-to-one correspondences from data sets with the same number of instances in source and target domains, and this prevents us from applying UOM to real-world cross-language natural language processing tasks. To alleviate these limitations, we proposes latent semantic matching, which embeds objects in both source and target language domains into a shared latent topic space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on cross-language text categorization. The results show that our method outperforms conventional unsupervised object matching methods.</p><p>6 0.97954857 <a title="162-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Adaptive_Parser-Centric_Text_Normalization.html">37 acl-2013-Adaptive Parser-Centric Text Normalization</a></p>

<p>Author: Anoop Kunchukuttan ; Rajen Chatterjee ; Shourya Roy ; Abhijit Mishra ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: Large amount of parallel corpora is required for building Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems. We describe the TransDoop system for gathering translations to create parallel corpora from online crowd workforce who have familiarity with multiple languages but are not expert translators. Our system uses a Map-Reduce-like approach to translation crowdsourcing where sentence translation is decomposed into the following smaller tasks: (a) translation ofconstituent phrases of the sentence; (b) validation of quality of the phrase translations; and (c) composition of complete sentence translations from phrase translations. Trans- Doop incorporates quality control mechanisms and easy-to-use worker user interfaces designed to address issues with translation crowdsourcing. We have evaluated the crowdâ€™s output using the METEOR metric. For a complex domain like judicial proceedings, the higher scores obtained by the map-reduce based approach compared to complete sentence translation establishes the efficacy of our work.</p><p>3 0.12832804 <a title="385-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Development_and_Analysis_of_NLP_Pipelines_in_Argo.html">118 acl-2013-Development and Analysis of NLP Pipelines in Argo</a></p>
<p>Author: Rafal Rak ; Andrew Rowley ; Jacob Carter ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: Developing sophisticated NLP pipelines composed of multiple processing tools and components available through different providers may pose a challenge in terms of their interoperability. The Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) is an industry standard whose aim is to ensure such interoperability by defining common data structures and interfaces. The architecture has been gaining attention from industry and academia alike, resulting in a large volume ofUIMA-compliant processing components. In this paper, we demonstrate Argo, a Web-based workbench for the development and processing of NLP pipelines/workflows. The workbench is based upon UIMA, and thus has the potential of using many of the existing UIMA resources. We present features, and show examples, offacilitating the distributed development of components and the analysis of processing results. The latter includes annotation visualisers and editors, as well as serialisation to RDF format, which enables flexible querying in addition to data manipulation thanks to the semantic query language SPARQL. The distributed development feature allows users to seamlessly connect their tools to workflows running in Argo, and thus take advantage of both the available library of components (without the need of installing them locally) and the analytical tools.</p><p>4 0.10760126 <a title="385-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-DKPro_Similarity%3A_An_Open_Source_Framework_for_Text_Similarity.html">104 acl-2013-DKPro Similarity: An Open Source Framework for Text Similarity</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Bar ; Torsten Zesch ; Iryna Gurevych</p><p>Abstract: We present DKPro Similarity, an open source framework for text similarity. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive repository of text similarity measures which are implemented using standardized interfaces. DKPro Similarity comprises a wide variety of measures ranging from ones based on simple n-grams and common subsequences to high-dimensional vector comparisons and structural, stylistic, and phonetic measures. In order to promote the reproducibility of experimental results and to provide reliable, permanent experimental conditions for future studies, DKPro Similarity additionally comes with a set of full-featured experimental setups which can be run out-of-the-box and be used for future systems to built upon.</p><p>5 0.1001808 <a title="385-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Annotating_named_entities_in_clinical_text_by_combining_pre-annotation_and_active_learning.html">52 acl-2013-Annotating named entities in clinical text by combining pre-annotation and active learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Maria Skeppstedt</p><p>Abstract: For expanding a corpus of clinical text, annotated for named entities, a method that combines pre-tagging with a version of active learning is proposed. In order to facilitate annotation and to avoid bias, two alternative automatic pre-taggings are presented to the annotator, without revealing which of them is given a higher confidence by the pre-tagging system. The task of the annotator is to select the correct version among these two alternatives. To minimise the instances in which none of the presented pre-taggings is correct, the texts presented to the annotator are actively selected from a pool of unlabelled text, with the selection criterion that one of the presented pre-taggings should have a high probability of being correct, while still being useful for improving the result of an automatic classifier.</p><p>6 0.099023715 <a title="385-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Extending_an_interoperable_platform_to_facilitate_the_creation_of_multilingual_and_multimodal_NLP_applications.html">150 acl-2013-Extending an interoperable platform to facilitate the creation of multilingual and multimodal NLP applications</a></p>

<p>Author: Valentin Tablan ; Kalina Bontcheva ; Ian Roberts ; Hamish Cunningham ; Marin Dimitrov</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents AnnoMarket, an open cloud-based platform which enables researchers to deploy, share, and use language processing components and resources, following the data-as-a-service and software-as-a-service paradigms. The focus is on multilingual text analysis resources and services, based on an opensource infrastructure and compliant with relevant NLP standards. We demonstrate how the AnnoMarket platform can be used to develop NLP applications with little or no programming, to index the results for enhanced browsing and search, and to evaluate performance. Utilising AnnoMarket is straightforward, since cloud infrastructural issues are dealt with by the platform, completely transparently to the user: load balancing, efficient data upload and storage, deployment on the virtual machines, security, and fault tolerance.</p><p>4 0.83380532 <a title="385-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Extending_an_interoperable_platform_to_facilitate_the_creation_of_multilingual_and_multimodal_NLP_applications.html">150 acl-2013-Extending an interoperable platform to facilitate the creation of multilingual and multimodal NLP applications</a></p>
<p>Author: Georgios Kontonatsios ; Paul Thompson ; Riza Theresa Batista-Navarro ; Claudiu Mihaila ; Ioannis Korkontzelos ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: U-Compare is a UIMA-based workflow construction platform for building natural language processing (NLP) applications from heterogeneous language resources (LRs), without the need for programming skills. U-Compare has been adopted within the context of the METANET Network of Excellence, and over 40 LRs that process 15 European languages have been added to the U-Compare component library. In line with METANETâ€™s aims of increasing communication between citizens of different European countries, U-Compare has been extended to facilitate the development of a wider range of applications, including both mul- tilingual and multimodal workflows. The enhancements exploit the UIMA Subject of Analysis (Sofa) mechanism, that allows different facets of the input data to be represented. We demonstrate how our customised extensions to U-Compare allow the construction and testing of NLP applications that transform the input data in different ways, e.g., machine translation, automatic summarisation and text-to-speech.</p><p>5 0.76640242 <a title="385-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Crowdsourcing_Interaction_Logs_to_Understand_Text_Reuse_from_the_Web.html">100 acl-2013-Crowdsourcing Interaction Logs to Understand Text Reuse from the Web</a></p>

The distributed development feature allows users to seamlessly connect their tools to workflows running in Argo, and thus take advantage of both the available library of components (without the need of installing them locally) and the analytical tools.</p><p>3 0.68788552 <a title="385-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Towards_Accurate_Distant_Supervision_for_Relational_Facts_Extraction.html">352 acl-2013-Towards Accurate Distant Supervision for Relational Facts Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Xingxing Zhang ; Jianwen Zhang ; Junyu Zeng ; Jun Yan ; Zheng Chen ; Zhifang Sui</p><p>Abstract: Distant supervision (DS) is an appealing learning method which learns from existing relational facts to extract more from a text corpus. However, the accuracy is still not satisfying. In this paper, we point out and analyze some critical factors in DS which have great impact on accuracy, including valid entity type detection, negative training examples construction and ensembles. We propose an approach to handle these factors. By experimenting on Wikipedia articles to extract the facts in Freebase (the top 92 relations), we show the impact of these three factors on the accuracy of DS and the remarkable improvement led by the proposed approach.</p><p>4 0.68738413 <a title="385-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Efficient_Implementation_of_Beam-Search_Incremental_Parsers.html">133 acl-2013-Efficient Implementation of Beam-Search Incremental Parsers</a></p>
<p>Author: Yoav Goldberg ; Kai Zhao ; Liang Huang</p><p>Abstract: Beam search incremental parsers are accurate, but not as fast as they could be. We demonstrate that, contrary to popular belief, most current implementations of beam parsers in fact run in O(n2), rather than linear time, because each statetransition is actually implemented as an O(n) operation. We present an improved implementation, based on Tree Structured Stack (TSS), in which a transition is performed in O(1), resulting in a real lineartime algorithm, which is verified empiri- cally. We further improve parsing speed by sharing feature-extraction and dotproduct across beam items. Practically, our methods combined offer a speedup of âˆ¼2x over strong baselines on Penn Treebâˆ¼a2nxk sentences, a bnads are eosrd oenrs P eofn magnitude faster on much longer sentences.</p><p>5 0.68636984 <a title="385-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-DKPro_WSD%3A_A_Generalized_UIMA-based_Framework_for_Word_Sense_Disambiguation.html">105 acl-2013-DKPro WSD: A Generalized UIMA-based Framework for Word Sense Disambiguation</a></p>
<p>Author: Tristan Miller ; Nicolai Erbs ; Hans-Peter Zorn ; Torsten Zesch ; Iryna Gurevych</p><p>Abstract: Implementations of word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithms tend to be tied to a particular test corpus format and sense inventory. This makes it difficult to test their performance on new data sets, or to compare them against past algorithms implemented for different data sets. In this paper we present DKPro WSD, a freely licensed, general-purpose framework for WSD which is both modular and extensible. DKPro WSD abstracts the WSD process in such a way that test corpora, sense inventories, and algorithms can be freely swapped. Its UIMA-based architecture makes it easy to add support for new resources and algorithms. Related tasks such as word sense induction and entity linking are also supported.</p><p>6 0.68608385 <a title="385-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Annotating_named_entities_in_clinical_text_by_combining_pre-annotation_and_active_learning.html">52 acl-2013-Annotating named entities in clinical text by combining pre-annotation and active learning</a></p>

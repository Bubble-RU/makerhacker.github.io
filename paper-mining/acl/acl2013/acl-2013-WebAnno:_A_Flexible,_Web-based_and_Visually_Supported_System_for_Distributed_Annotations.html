</p><p>2 WebAnno offers annotation project management, freely configurable tagsets and the management of users in different roles. [sent-6, score-0.524]
</p><p>3 WebAnno uses modern web technology for visualizing and editing annotations in a web browser. [sent-7, score-0.119]
</p><p>4 It supports arbitrarily large documents, pluggable import/export filters, the curation of annotations across various users, and an interface to farming out annotations to a crowdsourcing platform. [sent-8, score-0.643]
</p><p>5 Currently WebAnno allows part-ofspeech, named entity, dependency parsing and co-reference chain annotations. [sent-9, score-0.079]
</p><p>6 The  architecture design allows adding additional modes of visualization and editing, when new kinds of annotations are to be supported. [sent-10, score-0.168]
</p><p>7 Linguistic annotation is a process whereby linguistic information is added to a document, such as part-of-speech, lemmata, named entities, or dependency relations. [sent-12, score-0.301]
</p><p>8 In the past, platforms for linguistic annotations were mostly developed ad-hoc for the given annotation task at hand, used proprietary formats for data exchange, or required local installation effort. [sent-13, score-0.463]
</p><p>9 We present WebAnno, a browser-based tool that is immediately usable by any annotator with internet access. [sent-14, score-0.133]
</p><p>10 de Furthermore, an interface to crowdsourcing platforms enables scaling out simple annotation tasks to a large numbers of micro-workers. [sent-17, score-0.492]
</p><p>11 The added value of WebAnno, as compared to previous annotation tools, is on the one hand its web-based interface targeted at skilled as well as unskilled annotators, which unlocks a potentially very large workforce. [sent-18, score-0.333]
</p><p>12 On the other hand, it is the support for quality control, annotator management, and adjudication/curation, which lowers the entrance barrier for new annotation projects. [sent-19, score-0.371]
</p><p>13 We created WebAnno to fulfill the following requirements: •  •  •  Web-based: Distributed work, no installation effort, aisncerde:a Dseidst availability. [sent-20, score-0.057]
</p><p>14 Quality and user management: Integrated dQiuffaelrietnyt user e rrol emsa support (administrator, annotator, and curator), inter-annotator agreement measurement, data curation, and  progress monitoring. [sent-22, score-0.233]
</p><p>15 •  •  •  Flexibility: Support of multiple annotation layers, pluggable import manudlt export formats, and extensibility to other front ends. [sent-23, score-0.378]
</p><p>16 Permissive open source: Usability of our tool iPne rfmutiusrseiv projects owuritcheo:u Ut restrictions, urn todoelr the Apache 2. [sent-25, score-0.057]
</p><p>17 In the following section, we revisit related work on annotation tools, which only partially fulfill the aforementioned requirements. [sent-27, score-0.278]
</p><p>18 In Section 3, the architecture as well as usage aspects of our tool are lined out. [sent-28, score-0.099]
</p><p>19 The scope and functionality summary 1  Proce diSnogfsia, of B thuleg5a r1iast, A Anungu aslt M4-9e t2in01g3 o. [sent-29, score-0.055]
</p><p>20 Section 5 elaborates on several use cases of WebAnno, and Section 6 concludes and gives an outlook to fur-  ther directions. [sent-32, score-0.058]
</p><p>21 , 2010) is probably the tool that closely matches our requirements regarding quality management, annotator management, and support of a large set of annotation layers and formats. [sent-34, score-0.606]
</p><p>22 It is mostly web-based, but the annotation is carried out with locally downloaded software. [sent-35, score-0.251]
</p><p>23 It sets a focus on the integration of automatic annotation components rather than on the interface for manual annotation. [sent-38, score-0.333]
</p><p>24 Besides, the overall application is rather complex for average users, requires considerable training and does not offer an alternative simplified interface as it would be required for crowdsourcing. [sent-39, score-0.082]
</p><p>25 General-purpose annotation tools like MMAX2 (M¨ uller and Strube, 2006) or WordFreak (Morton and LaCivita, 2003) are not web-based and do not provide annotation project management. [sent-40, score-0.631]
</p><p>26 The same holds for specialized tools for single annotation layers, which we cannot list here for the sake of brevity. [sent-42, score-0.284]
</p><p>27 With the brat rapid annotation tool (Stenetorp et al. [sent-43, score-0.533]
</p><p>28 , 2012), for the first time a web-based opensource annotation tool was introduced, which supports collaborative annotation for multiple annotation layers simultaneously on a single copy of the document, and is based on a client-server architecture. [sent-44, score-1.051]
</p><p>29 However, the current version of brat has limitations such as: (i) slowness for documents of more than 100 sentences, (ii) limits regarding file formats, (iii) web-based configuration of tagsets/tags is not possible and (iv) configuring the display of multiple layers is not yet supported. [sent-45, score-0.496]
</p><p>30 While we use brat’s excellent visualization front end in WebAnno, we decided to replace the server layer to support the user and quality management, and monitoring tools as well as to add the interface to crowdsourcing. [sent-46, score-0.488]
</p><p>31 The modularity of the architecture,  2  Figure 1: System architecture, organized in user, front end, back end and persistent data storage. [sent-48, score-0.213]
</p><p>32 which is mirrored in its open-source implementation1, makes it possible to easily extend the tool or add alternative user interfaces for annotation layers that brat is less suited for, e. [sent-49, score-0.714]
</p><p>33 1, we illustrate how different user roles are provided with different graphical user interfaces, and show the expressiveness of the  annotation model. [sent-53, score-0.391]
</p><p>34 2 elaborates on the functionality of the back end, and describes how data is imported and exported, as well as our implementation of the persistent data storage. [sent-55, score-0.176]
</p><p>35 1 Front End All functionality of WebAnno is accessible via a web browser. [sent-57, score-0.055]
</p><p>36 For annotation and visualization of annotated documents, we adapted the brat rapid annotation tool. [sent-58, score-0.766]
</p><p>37 Changes had to be made to make brat interoperate with the Apache Wicket, on which WebAnno is built, and to better integrate into the WebAnno experience. [sent-59, score-0.204]
</p><p>38 1  Project Definition  The definition and the monitoring of an annotation project is conducted by a project manager (cf. [sent-62, score-0.532]
</p><p>39 It supports creating a project, loading un-annotated or preannotated documents in different formats2, adding annotator and curator users, defining tagsets, and configuring the annotation layers. [sent-64, score-0.675]
</p><p>40 Only a project  manager can administer a project. [sent-65, score-0.108]
</p><p>41 Figure 2 illustrates the project definition page with the tagset editor highlighted. [sent-66, score-0.171]
</p><p>42 , 2010), UIMA XMI (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004)  Figure 2: The tagset editor  on  the project definition  page  3. [sent-73, score-0.171]
</p><p>43 2 Annotation Annotation is carried out with an adapted version of the brat editor, which communicates with the server via Ajax (Wang et al. [sent-75, score-0.227]
</p><p>44 We use a paging mechanism that limits the number of sentences displayed at a time to make the performance independent of the document size. [sent-80, score-0.078]
</p><p>45 Overloading the annotation page by displaying all annotation layers makes the annotation and visualization process slower. [sent-82, score-1.008]
</p><p>46 WebAnno provides an option to configure visible/editable annotation layers. [sent-83, score-0.295]
</p><p>47 Immediate persistence: Every annotation is sImenmt etdoi atthee p bearcskis eenncde immediately atnatdio persisted there. [sent-84, score-0.29]
</p><p>48 An explicit interaction by the user to save changes is not required. [sent-85, score-0.07]
</p><p>49 Every annotator works on a 3 separate version of the document, which is set to the state in progress the first time a document is opened by the annotator. [sent-89, score-0.184]
</p><p>50 The annotator can then mark it as complete at the end of annotation at which point it is locked for further annotation and can be used for curation. [sent-90, score-0.612]
</p><p>51 4 Curation The curation interface allows the curator to open a document and compare annotations made by the annotators that already marked the document as complete. [sent-95, score-0.565]
</p><p>52 The curator can either decide on one of the presented alternatives, or freely reannotate. [sent-97, score-0.174]
</p><p>53 Figure 3 illustrates how the curation interface detects sentences with annotation disagreement (left side of Figure 3) which can be used to navigate to the sentences for curation. [sent-98, score-0.486]
</p><p>54 5 Monitoring WebAnno provides a monitoring component, to track the progress of a project. [sent-101, score-0.144]
</p><p>55 The project manager can check the progress and compute agreement with Kappa and Tau (Carletta, 1996) measures. [sent-102, score-0.177]
</p><p>56 The progress is visualized using a matrix of annotators and documents displaying which documents the annotators have marked as complete and which documents the curator adjudicated. [sent-103, score-0.528]
</p><p>57 Figure 4 shows the project progress, progress of individual annotator and completion statistics. [sent-104, score-0.214]
</p><p>58 Figure 3: Curation user interface (left: sentences with disagreement; right: merging editor) 3. [sent-105, score-0.152]
</p><p>59 6 Crowdsourcing Crowdsourcing is a way to quickly scale annotation projects. [sent-107, score-0.251]
</p><p>60 Distributing a task that otherwise will be performed by a controlled user group has become much easier. [sent-108, score-0.07]
</p><p>61 Hence, if quality can be ensured, it is an alternative to high quality annotation using a large number of arbitrary redundant annotations (Wang et al. [sent-109, score-0.378]
</p><p>62 The crowdsourcing component is a separate module that handles the communication via CrowdFlower’s API, the definition of test items and job parameters, and the aggregation of results. [sent-112, score-0.157]
</p><p>63 The crowdsourced annotation appears as a virtual annotator in the tool. [sent-113, score-0.349]
</p><p>64 Since it is not trivial to express complex annotation tasks in comparably simple templates suitable for crowdsourcing (Biemann, 2013), we proceed by working out crowdsourcing templates and strategies per annotation layer. [sent-114, score-0.758]
</p><p>65 We currently only support named entity annotation with predefined templates. [sent-115, score-0.327]
</p><p>66 However, the open and modular architecture allows to add more crowdsourced annotation layers. [sent-116, score-0.315]
</p><p>67 In memory and on the file system, annotations are stored 3www . [sent-119, score-0.141]
</p><p>68 com 4  Figure 4: Project monitoring as UIMA CAS objects (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004). [sent-121, score-0.075]
</p><p>69 1  Data Conversion  WebAnno supports different data models that reflect the different communication of data between the front end, back end, and the persistent data storage. [sent-125, score-0.266]
</p><p>70 The brat data model serves exchanging data between the front end and the back end. [sent-126, score-0.361]
</p><p>71 This is converted to the brat model for visualization. [sent-129, score-0.204]
</p><p>72 Importing documents and exporting annotations is implemented using UIMA reader and writer components from DKPro Core as plug-ins. [sent-130, score-0.186]
</p><p>73 Thus, support for new formats can easily be added. [sent-131, score-0.088]
</p><p>74 To provide quick reaction times in the user interface, WebAnno internally stores annotations in a binary format, using the SerializedCasReader and SerializedCasWriter components. [sent-132, score-0.157]
</p><p>75 2 Persistent Project definitions scriptions, tagsets kept in a database,  Data Storage including project name and deand tags, and user details are whereas the documents and an-  notations are stored in the file system. [sent-135, score-0.303]
</p><p>76 WebAnno supports limited versioning of annotations, to protect against the unforeseen loss of data. [sent-136, score-0.087]
</p><p>77 com/p / dkpro-core-as  4  Figure 5: WebAnno database scheme Scope and Functionality Summary  /  l  WebAnno supports the production oflinguistically annotated corpora for different natural language processing applications. [sent-140, score-0.087]
</p><p>78 WebAnno implements ease of usage and simplicity for untrained users, and provides: • Annotation via a fast, and easy-to-use webbAansnedot user nin vtiearf aac faes. [sent-141, score-0.09]
</p><p>79 • Interactive curation by adjudicating disagreeing arnacntiovteati counras firoonm b multiple users. [sent-144, score-0.133]
</p><p>80 5 Use Cases WebAnno currently allows to configure different span and arc annotations. [sent-147, score-0.143]
</p><p>81 It comes pre-configured with the following annotation layers from the DKPro Core type system: Span annotations • Part-of-Speech (POS) tags: an annotation tPaasrkt on Stopkeeencsh. [sent-148, score-0.721]
</p><p>82 POS annotation is a prerequisite of dependency annotation (Figure 6). [sent-150, score-0.524]
</p><p>83 5  Figure 6: Parts-of-speech & dependency relations  Figure 7: Co-reference & named entites •  Named entities: a multiple span annotation tNasakm. [sent-151, score-0.334]
</p><p>84 The co-reference relation annotation can cross multiple sentences and is represented in co-reference chains (Figure 7). [sent-155, score-0.275]
</p><p>85 The brat front end supports tokens and subtokens as a span annotation. [sent-156, score-0.446]
</p><p>86 However, tokens are currently the minimal annotation units in WebAnno, due to a requirement of supporting the TCF file format (Heid et al. [sent-157, score-0.334]
</p><p>87 Part-of-speech annotation is limited to singles token, while named entity and co-reference chain annotations may span multiple tokens. [sent-159, score-0.428]
</p><p>88 Dependency relations are implemented in such a way that the arc is drawn from the governor to the dependent (or the other way around, configurable), while co-reference  chains are unidirectional and a chain is formed by referents that are transitively connected by arcs. [sent-160, score-0.095]
</p><p>89 Based on common practice in manual annotation, every user works on their own copy of the same document so that no concurrent editing occurs. [sent-161, score-0.163]
</p><p>90 We also found that displaying all annotation layers at the same time is inconvenient for annotators. [sent-162, score-0.446]
</p><p>91 This is why WebAnno supports showing and hiding of individual annotation layers. [sent-163, score-0.338]
</p><p>92 The WebAnno curation component displays all annotation documents from all users for a given source document, enabling the curator to visualize all of the annotations with differences at a time. [sent-164, score-0.717]
</p><p>93 Unlike most of the annotation tools which rely on configuration files, WebAnno enables to freely configure all parameters directly in the browser. [sent-165, score-0.348]
</p><p>94 6  Conclusion and Outlook  WebAnno is a new web-based linguistic annotation tool. [sent-166, score-0.251]
</p><p>95 Besides, WebAnno supports project definition, import/export of tag and tagsets. [sent-168, score-0.156]
</p><p>96 Flexible support for importing and exporting different data formats is handled through UIMA components from the DKPro Core project. [sent-169, score-0.161]
</p><p>97 The monitoring component of WebAnno helps the administrator to control the progress of annotators. [sent-170, score-0.178]
</p><p>98 The crowdsourcing component of WebAnno provides a unique functionality to distribute the annotation to a large workforce and automatically integrate the results back into the tool via the crowdsourcing server. [sent-171, score-0.654]
</p><p>99 The WebAnno annotation tool supports curation of different annotation documents, displaying annotation documents created by users in a given project with annotation disagreements. [sent-172, score-1.505]
</p><p>100 In future work, WebAnno will be enhanced to support several other front ends to handle even more annotation layers, and to provide more crowdsourcing templates. [sent-173, score-0.491]

<p>Author: Rafal Rak ; Andrew Rowley ; Jacob Carter ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: Developing sophisticated NLP pipelines composed of multiple processing tools and components available through different providers may pose a challenge in terms of their interoperability. The Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) is an industry standard whose aim is to ensure such interoperability by defining common data structures and interfaces. The architecture has been gaining attention from industry and academia alike, resulting in a large volume ofUIMA-compliant processing components. In this paper, we demonstrate Argo, a Web-based workbench for the development and processing of NLP pipelines/workflows. The workbench is based upon UIMA, and thus has the potential of using many of the existing UIMA resources. We present features, and show examples, offacilitating the distributed development of components and the analysis of processing results. The latter includes annotation visualisers and editors, as well as serialisation to RDF format, which enables flexible querying in addition to data manipulation thanks to the semantic query language SPARQL. The distributed development feature allows users to seamlessly connect their tools to workflows running in Argo, and thus take advantage of both the available library of components (without the need of installing them locally) and the analytical tools.</p><p>3 0.10381298 <a title="385-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-TransDoop%3A_A_Map-Reduce_based_Crowdsourced_Translation_for_Complex_Domain.html">355 acl-2013-TransDoop: A Map-Reduce based Crowdsourced Translation for Complex Domain</a></p>
<p>Author: Anoop Kunchukuttan ; Rajen Chatterjee ; Shourya Roy ; Abhijit Mishra ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: Large amount of parallel corpora is required for building Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems. We describe the TransDoop system for gathering translations to create parallel corpora from online crowd workforce who have familiarity with multiple languages but are not expert translators. Our system uses a Map-Reduce-like approach to translation crowdsourcing where sentence translation is decomposed into the following smaller tasks: (a) translation ofconstituent phrases of the sentence; (b) validation of quality of the phrase translations; and (c) composition of complete sentence translations from phrase translations. Trans- Doop incorporates quality control mechanisms and easy-to-use worker user interfaces designed to address issues with translation crowdsourcing. We have evaluated the crowd’s output using the METEOR metric. For a complex domain like judicial proceedings, the higher scores obtained by the map-reduce based approach compared to complete sentence translation establishes the efficacy of our work.</p><p>4 0.10155258 <a title="385-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-AnnoMarket%3A_An_Open_Cloud_Platform_for_NLP.html">51 acl-2013-AnnoMarket: An Open Cloud Platform for NLP</a></p>
<p>Author: Valentin Tablan ; Kalina Bontcheva ; Ian Roberts ; Hamish Cunningham ; Marin Dimitrov</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents AnnoMarket, an open cloud-based platform which enables researchers to deploy, share, and use language processing components and resources, following the data-as-a-service and software-as-a-service paradigms.

<p>Author: Ulle Endriss ; Raquel Fernandez</p><p>Abstract: Crowdsourcing, which offers new ways of cheaply and quickly gathering large amounts of information contributed by volunteers online, has revolutionised the collection of labelled data. Yet, to create annotated linguistic resources from this data, we face the challenge of having to combine the judgements of a potentially large group of annotators. In this paper we investigate how to aggregate individual annotations into a single collective annotation, taking inspiration from the field of social choice theory. We formulate a general formal model for collective annotation and propose several aggregation methods that go beyond the commonly used majority rule. We test some of our methods on data from a crowdsourcing experiment on textual entailment annotation.</p><p>6 0.099658296 <a title="385-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Annotating_named_entities_in_clinical_text_by_combining_pre-annotation_and_active_learning.html">52 acl-2013-Annotating named entities in clinical text by combining pre-annotation and active learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Georgios Kontonatsios ; Paul Thompson ; Riza Theresa Batista-Navarro ; Claudiu Mihaila ; Ioannis Korkontzelos ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: U-Compare is a UIMA-based workflow construction platform for building natural language processing (NLP) applications from heterogeneous language resources (LRs), without the need for programming skills. U-Compare has been adopted within the context of the METANET Network of Excellence, and over 40 LRs that process 15 European languages have been added to the U-Compare component library. In line with METANET’s aims of increasing communication between citizens of different European countries, U-Compare has been extended to facilitate the development of a wider range of applications, including both mul- tilingual and multimodal workflows. The enhancements exploit the UIMA Subject of Analysis (Sofa) mechanism, that allows different facets of the input data to be represented. We demonstrate how our customised extensions to U-Compare allow the construction and testing of NLP applications that transform the input data in different ways, e.g., machine translation, automatic summarisation and text-to-speech.</p><p>5 0.59369498 <a title="385-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Annotating_named_entities_in_clinical_text_by_combining_pre-annotation_and_active_learning.html">52 acl-2013-Annotating named entities in clinical text by combining pre-annotation and active learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Maria Skeppstedt</p><p>Abstract: For expanding a corpus of clinical text, annotated for named entities, a method that combines pre-tagging with a version of active learning is proposed. In order to facilitate annotation and to avoid bias, two alternative automatic pre-taggings are presented to the annotator, without revealing which of them is given a higher confidence by the pre-tagging system. The task of the annotator is to select the correct version among these two alternatives. To minimise the instances in which none of the presented pre-taggings is correct, the texts presented to the annotator are actively selected from a pool of unlabelled text, with the selection criterion that one of the presented pre-taggings should have a high probability of being correct, while still being useful for improving the result of an automatic classifier.</p><p>6 0.58432853 <a title="385-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Collective_Annotation_of_Linguistic_Resources%3A_Basic_Principles_and_a_Formal_Model.html">83 acl-2013-Collective Annotation of Linguistic Resources: Basic Principles and a Formal Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Vasileios Lampos ; Daniel PreoÅ£iuc-Pietro ; Trevor Cohn</p><p>Abstract: Social Media contain a multitude of user opinions which can be used to predict realworld phenomena in many domains including politics, finance and health. Most existing methods treat these problems as linear regression, learning to relate word frequencies and other simple features to a known response variable (e.g., voting intention polls or financial indicators). These techniques require very careful filtering of the input texts, as most Social Media posts are irrelevant to the task. In this paper, we present a novel approach which performs high quality filtering automatically, through modelling not just words but also users, framed as a bilinear model with a sparse regulariser. We also consider the problem of modelling groups of related output variables, using a structured multi-task regularisation method. Our experiments on voting intention prediction demonstrate strong performance over large-scale input from Twitter on two distinct case studies, outperforming competitive baselines.</p><p>3 0.71052092 <a title="385-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Joint_Apposition_Extraction_with_Syntactic_and_Semantic_Constraints.html">205 acl-2013-Joint Apposition Extraction with Syntactic and Semantic Constraints</a></p>

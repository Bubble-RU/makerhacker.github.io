</p><p>2 s g Abstract Resource scarcity along with diversity– both in dialect and script–are the two primary challenges in Kurdish language processing. [sent-3, score-0.105]
</p><p>3 1 Introduction Despite having 20 to 30 millions of native speak-  ers (Haig and Matras, 2002; Hassanpour et al. [sent-5, score-0.012]
</p><p>4 , 2012; Thackston, 2006b; Thackston, 2006a), Kurdish is among the less-resourced languages for which the only linguistic resource available on the Web is raw text (Walther and Sagot, 2010). [sent-6, score-0.012]
</p><p>5 Apart from the resource-scarcity problem, its diversity –in both dialect and writing systems– is another primary challenge in Kurdish language processing (Gautier, 1998; Gautier, 1996; Esmaili, 2012). [sent-7, score-0.121]
</p><p>6 , 2012): the Sorani dialect written in an Arabic-based alphabet and the Kurmanji dialect written in a Latinbased alphabet. [sent-9, score-0.135]
</p><p>7 The features distinguishing these two dialects are phonological, lexical, and morphological. [sent-10, score-0.117]
</p><p>8 In this paper we report on the first outcomes of a project1 at University of Kurdistan (UoK) that aims at addressing these two challenges of the Kurdish language processing. [sent-11, score-0.031]

</p><p>10 we present some insights into the orthographic, phonological, and morphological differences between Sorani Kurdish and Kurmanji Kurdish. [sent-20, score-0.048]
</p><p>11 In Section 2, we first briefly introduce the Kurdish language and its two main dialects then underline their differences from a rule-based (a. [sent-22, score-0.144]
</p><p>12 Next, after presenting the Pewan text corpus in Section 3, we use it to conduct a statistical comparison ofthe two dialects in Section 4. [sent-26, score-0.117]
</p><p>13 It is one of the two official languages of Iraq and has a regional status in Iran. [sent-31, score-0.027]
</p><p>14 Kurdish is a dialect-rich language, sometimes referred to as a dialect continuum (Matras and Akin, 2012; Shahsavari, 2010). [sent-32, score-0.061]
</p><p>15 In this paper, however, we focus on Sorani and Kurmanji which are the two closely-related and widely-spoken dialects of the Kurdish language. [sent-33, score-0.117]
</p><p>16 Together, they account for more than 75% of native Kurdish speakers (Walther and Sagot, 2010). [sent-34, score-0.028]
</p><p>17 As summarized below, these two dialects differ not only in some linguistics aspects, but also in their writing systems. [sent-35, score-0.148]
</p><p>18 1 Morphological Differences The important morphological differences are (MacKenzie, 1961 ; Haig and Matras,  2002; Samvelian, 2007): 1. [sent-37, score-0.048]

</p><p>22 2 Scriptural Differences Due to geopolitical reasons (Matras and Reershemius, 1991), each of the two dialects has been using its own writing system: while Sorani uses an Arabic-based alphabet, Kurmanji is written in a Latin-based one. [sent-46, score-0.148]
</p><p>23 2Although there is evidence of gender distinctions weakening in some varieties of Kurmanji (Haig and Matras, 2002). [sent-50, score-0.021]
</p><p>24 3Recent research suggests that ergativity in Kurmanji is weakening due to either internally-induced change or contact with Turkish (Dixon, 1994; Dorleijn, 1996; Mahalingappa, 2010), perhaps moving towards a full nominative-accusative system. [sent-51, score-0.045]
</p><p>25 It should be noted that both of these writing systems are phonetic (Gautier, 1998); that is, vowels are explicitly represented and their use is mandatory. [sent-53, score-0.031]
</p><p>26 At UoK, we followed TREC (TREC, 2013)’s common practice and used news articles to build a text corpus for the Kurdish language. [sent-56, score-0.024]
</p><p>27 For each agency, we developed a crawler to fetch the articles and extract their textual content. [sent-59, score-0.024]
</p><p>28 In case of Peyamner, since articles have no language label, we additionally implemented a simple classifier that decides each page’s language 4Although there Kurmanji too. [sent-60, score-0.024]
</p><p>29 Overall, 115,340 Sorani articles and 25,572 Kurmanji articles were collected5 . [sent-66, score-0.048]
</p><p>30 The articles are dated between 2003 and 2012 and their sizes range from 1KB to 154KB (on average 2. [sent-67, score-0.024]
</p><p>31 The final Sorani and Kurmanji lists contain 157 and 152 words respectively, and as in other languages, they mainly consist of prepositions. [sent-74, score-0.017]
</p><p>32 Pewan, as well as the stopword lists can be obtained from (Pewan, 2013). [sent-75, score-0.032]
</p><p>33 4  Empirical Study  In the first part of this section, we first look at the character and word frequencies and try to obtain some insights about the phonological and lexical correlations and discrepancies between Sorani and Kurmanji. [sent-77, score-0.136]
</p><p>34 In the second part, we investigate two wellknown linguistic laws –Heaps’ and Zipf’s. [sent-78, score-0.05]
</p><p>35 Although these laws have been observed in many of the Indo-European languages (L¨ u et al. [sent-79, score-0.062]
</p><p>36 , 2013), the their coefficients depend on language (Gelbukh and Sidorov, 2001) and therefore they can be  5The relatively small size of the Kurmanji collection is part of a more general trend. [sent-80, score-0.027]
</p><p>37 In fact, despite having a larger number of speakers, Kurmanji has far fewer online sources with raw text readily available and even those sources do not strictly follow its writing standards. [sent-81, score-0.031]
</p><p>38 This is partly a result of decades of severe restrictions on use of Kurdish language in Turkey, where the majority of Kurmanji speakers live (Hassanpour et al. [sent-82, score-0.016]
</p><p>39 It should also be noted that in practice, knowing the coefficients of these laws is important in, for example, full-text database design, since it allows predicting some properties of the index as a function of the size of the database. [sent-85, score-0.077]
</p><p>40 1 Character Frequencies In this experiment we measure the character frequencies, as a phonological property of the language. [sent-87, score-0.088]
</p><p>41 Figure 2 shows the frequency-ranked lists (from left to right, in decreasing order) of characters of both dialects in the Pewan corpus. [sent-88, score-0.169]
</p><p>42 Note that for a fairer comparison, we have excluded characters with 1-to-0 and 1-to-2 mappings as well as three characters from the list of 1-to-1 mappings: A, Eˆ, and Uˆ. [sent-89, score-0.112]
</p><p>43 Overall, the relative positions of the equivalent characters in these two lists are comparable (Fig-  ure 2). [sent-92, score-0.052]
</p><p>44 However, there are two notable discrepancies which further exhibit the intrinsic phonological differences between Sorani and Kurmanji: •  • •  use of the character J is far more common iuns Kurmanji (e. [sent-93, score-0.138]

</p><p>52 In a logarithmic scale, it is a straight line with about 45◦ angle (Gelbukh and Sidorov, 2001). [sent-124, score-0.051]
</p><p>53 We carried out an experiment to measure the growth rate of distinct words for both of the Kurdish dialects as well as the Persian and English languages. [sent-125, score-0.162]
</p><p>54 , 2009) and The English corpus consisted of the Editorial articles of The Guardian newspaper7 (Guardian, 2013). [sent-127, score-0.024]
</p><p>55 As the curves in Figure 4 and the linear regression coefficients in Table 2 show, the growth rate of distinct words in both Sorani and Kurmanji Kurdish are higher than Persian and English. [sent-128, score-0.104]
</p><p>56 This result demonstrates the morphological complexity of the Kurdish language (Samvelian, 2007; Walther, 2011). [sent-129, score-0.021]
</p><p>57 Another important observation from this experiment is that Sorani has a higher growth rate compared to Kurmanji (h = 0. [sent-131, score-0.028]

</p><p>60 5  Conclusions and Future Work  In this paper we took the first steps towards addressing the two main challenges in Kurdish language processing, namely, resource scarcity and diversity. [sent-147, score-0.046]
</p><p>61 We presented Pewan, a text corpus for Sorani and Kurmanji, the two principal dialects of the Kurdish language. [sent-148, score-0.117]
</p><p>62 We also highlighted a range  of differences between these two dialects and their writing systems. [sent-149, score-0.175]
</p><p>63 Some of the discrepancies are due to the existence of a generic preposition ( ) in Sorani, as well as the general tendency in its writing system and style to use prepositions as suffix. [sent-154, score-0.12]
</p><p>64 In future, we plan to first develop stemming algorithms for both Sorani and Kurmanji and then leverage those algorithms to examine the lexical differences between the two dialects. [sent-158, score-0.027]

<p>Author: Hassan Sajjad ; Kareem Darwish ; Yonatan Belinkov</p><p>Abstract: We present a dialectal Egyptian Arabic to English statistical machine translation system that leverages dialectal to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) adaptation. In contrast to previous work, we first narrow down the gap between Egyptian and MSA by applying an automatic characterlevel transformational model that changes Egyptian to EG0, which looks similar to MSA. The transformations include morphological, phonological and spelling changes. The transformation reduces the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words from 5.2% to 2.6% and gives a gain of 1.87 BLEU points. Further, adapting large MSA/English parallel data increases the lexical coverage, reduces OOVs to 0.7% and leads to an absolute BLEU improvement of 2.73 points.</p><p>3 0.030803787 <a title="327-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Sentence_Level_Dialect_Identification_in_Arabic.html">317 acl-2013-Sentence Level Dialect Identification in Arabic</a></p>

We use token level labels to derive sentence-level features. These features are then used with other core and meta features to train a generative classifier that predicts the correct label for each sentence in the given input text. The system achieves an accuracy of 85.5% on an Arabic online-commentary dataset outperforming a previously proposed approach achieving 80.9% and reflecting a significant gain over a majority baseline of 5 1.9% and two strong baseline systems of 78.5% and 80.4%, respectively.</p><p>4 0.028444575 <a title="327-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Categorization_of_Turkish_News_Documents_with_Morphological_Analysis.html">78 acl-2013-Categorization of Turkish News Documents with Morphological Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Ahmed El Kholy ; Nizar Habash ; Gregor Leusch ; Evgeny Matusov ; Hassan Sawaf</p><p>Abstract: An important challenge to statistical machine translation (SMT) is the lack of parallel data for many language pairs. One common solution is to pivot through a third language for which there exist parallel corpora with the source and target languages. Although pivoting is a robust technique, it introduces some low quality translations. In this paper, we present two language-independent features to improve the quality of phrase-pivot based SMT. The features, source connectivity strength and target connectivity strength reflect the quality of projected alignments between the source and target phrases in the pivot phrase table. We show positive results (0.6 BLEU points) on Persian-Arabic SMT as a case study.</p><p>6 0.022497596 <a title="327-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Unsupervised_Consonant-Vowel_Prediction_over_Hundreds_of_Languages.html">369 acl-2013-Unsupervised Consonant-Vowel Prediction over Hundreds of Languages</a></p>

<p>Author: Kyumars Sheykh Esmaili ; Shahin Salavati</p><p>Abstract: Resource scarcity along with diversity– both in dialect and script–are the two primary challenges in Kurdish language processing. In this paper we aim at addressing these two problems by (i) building a text corpus for Sorani and Kurmanji, the two main dialects of Kurdish, and (ii) highlighting some of the orthographic, phonological, and morphological differences between these two dialects from statistical and rule-based perspectives.</p><p>2 0.69922954 <a title="327-lsi-2" href="./acl-2013-Sentence_Level_Dialect_Identification_in_Arabic.html">317 acl-2013-Sentence Level Dialect Identification in Arabic</a></p>
<p>Author: Heba Elfardy ; Mona Diab</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a supervised approach for performing sentence level dialect identification between Modern Standard Arabic and Egyptian Dialectal Arabic. We use token level labels to derive sentence-level features. These features are then used with other core and meta features to train a generative classifier that predicts the correct label for each sentence in the given input text. The system achieves an accuracy of 85.5% on an Arabic online-commentary dataset outperforming a previously proposed approach achieving 80.9% and reflecting a significant gain over a majority baseline of 5 1.9% and two strong baseline systems of 78.5% and 80.4%, respectively.</p><p>3 0.61966807 <a title="327-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Translating_Dialectal_Arabic_to_English.html">359 acl-2013-Translating Dialectal Arabic to English</a></p>
<p>Author: Hassan Sajjad ; Kareem Darwish ; Yonatan Belinkov</p><p>Abstract: We present a dialectal Egyptian Arabic to English statistical machine translation system that leverages dialectal to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) adaptation. In contrast to previous work, we first narrow down the gap between Egyptian and MSA by applying an automatic characterlevel transformational model that changes Egyptian to EG0, which looks similar to MSA. The transformations include morphological, phonological and spelling changes. The transformation reduces the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words from 5.2% to 2.6% and gives a gain of 1.87 BLEU points. Further, adapting large MSA/English parallel data increases the lexical coverage, reduces OOVs to 0.7% and leads to an absolute BLEU improvement of 2.73 points.</p><p>4 0.46250612 <a title="327-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Named_Entity_Recognition_using_Cross-lingual_Resources%3A_Arabic_as_an_Example.html">256 acl-2013-Named Entity Recognition using Cross-lingual Resources: Arabic as an Example</a></p>
<p>Author: Kareem Darwish</p><p>Abstract: Some languages lack large knowledge bases and good discriminative features for Name Entity Recognition (NER) that can generalize to previously unseen named entities. One such language is Arabic, which: a) lacks a capitalization feature; and b) has relatively small knowledge bases, such as Wikipedia. In this work we address both problems by incorporating cross-lingual features and knowledge bases from English using cross-lingual links. We show that such features have a dramatic positive effect on recall. We show the effectiveness of cross-lingual features and resources on a standard dataset as well as on two new test sets that cover both news and microblogs. On the standard dataset, we achieved a 4.1% relative improvement in Fmeasure over the best reported result in the literature. The features led to improvements of 17.1% and 20.5% on the new news and mi- croblogs test sets respectively.</p><p>5 0.437327 <a title="327-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Categorization_of_Turkish_News_Documents_with_Morphological_Analysis.html">78 acl-2013-Categorization of Turkish News Documents with Morphological Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Burak Kerim AkkuÅ� ; Ruket Cakici</p><p>Abstract: Morphologically rich languages such as Turkish may benefit from morphological analysis in natural language tasks. In this study, we examine the effects of morphological analysis on text categorization task in Turkish. We use stems and word categories that are extracted with morphological analysis as main features and compare them with fixed length stemmers in a bag of words approach with several learning algorithms. We aim to show the effects of using varying degrees of morphological information.</p><p>6 0.42925614 <a title="327-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-An_Open_Source_Toolkit_for_Quantitative_Historical_Linguistics.html">48 acl-2013-An Open Source Toolkit for Quantitative Historical Linguistics</a></p>

<p>Author: Greg Durrett ; David Hall ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Efficiently incorporating entity-level information is a challenge for coreference resolution systems due to the difficulty of exact inference over partitions. We describe an end-to-end discriminative probabilistic model for coreference that, along with standard pairwise features, enforces structural agreement constraints between specified properties of coreferent mentions. This model can be represented as a factor graph for each document that admits efficient inference via belief propagation. We show that our method can use entity-level information to outperform a basic pairwise system.</p><p>2 0.91246027 <a title="327-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Evaluating_a_City_Exploration_Dialogue_System_with_Integrated_Question-Answering_and_Pedestrian_Navigation.html">141 acl-2013-Evaluating a City Exploration Dialogue System with Integrated Question-Answering and Pedestrian Navigation</a></p>
<p>Author: Srinivasan Janarthanam ; Oliver Lemon ; Phil Bartie ; Tiphaine Dalmas ; Anna Dickinson ; Xingkun Liu ; William Mackaness ; Bonnie Webber</p><p>Abstract: We present a city navigation and tourist information mobile dialogue app with integrated question-answering (QA) and geographic information system (GIS) modules that helps pedestrian users to navigate in and learn about urban environments. In contrast to existing mobile apps which treat these problems independently, our Android app addresses the problem of navigation and touristic questionanswering in an integrated fashion using a shared dialogue context. We evaluated our system in comparison with Samsung S-Voice (which interfaces to Google navigation and Google search) with 17 users and found that users judged our system to be significantly more interesting to interact with and learn from. They also rated our system above Google search (with the Samsung S-Voice interface) for tourist information tasks.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.8759535 <a title="327-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Sorani_Kurdish_versus_Kurmanji_Kurdish%3A_An_Empirical_Comparison.html">327 acl-2013-Sorani Kurdish versus Kurmanji Kurdish: An Empirical Comparison</a></p>

<p>Author: Ryo Nagata ; Edward Whittaker</p><p>Abstract: Mother tongue interference is the phenomenon where linguistic systems of a mother tongue are transferred to another language. Although there has been plenty of work on mother tongue interference, very little is known about how strongly it is transferred to another language and about what relation there is across mother tongues. To address these questions, this paper explores and visualizes mother tongue interference preserved in English texts written by Indo-European language speakers. This paper further explores linguistic features that explain why certain relations are preserved in English writing, and which contribute to related tasks such as native language identification.</p><p>5 0.7812866 <a title="327-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Enhanced_and_Portable_Dependency_Projection_Algorithms_Using_Interlinear_Glossed_Text.html">136 acl-2013-Enhanced and Portable Dependency Projection Algorithms Using Interlinear Glossed Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan Georgi ; Fei Xia ; William D. Lewis</p><p>Abstract: As most of the world’s languages are under-resourced, projection algorithms offer an enticing way to bootstrap the resources available for one resourcepoor language from a resource-rich language by means of parallel text and word alignment. These algorithms, however, make the strong assumption that the language pairs share common structures and that the parse trees will resemble one another. This assumption is useful but often leads to errors in projection. In this paper, we will address this weakness by using trees created from instances of Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT) to discover patterns of divergence between the lan- guages. We will show that this method improves the performance of projection algorithms significantly in some languages by accounting for divergence between languages using only the partial supervision of a few corrected trees.</p><p>6 0.75957781 <a title="327-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Aggregated_Word_Pair_Features_for_Implicit_Discourse_Relation_Disambiguation.html">41 acl-2013-Aggregated Word Pair Features for Implicit Discourse Relation Disambiguation</a></p>

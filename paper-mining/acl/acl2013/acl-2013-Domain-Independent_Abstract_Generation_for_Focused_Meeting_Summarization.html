</p><p>5 Consequently, automatically generated meeting summaries could be of great value to people and businesses alike by providing quick access to the essential content of past meetings. [sent-9, score-0.483]
</p><p>6 Focused meeting summaries have been proposed as particularly useful; in contrast to summaries of a meeting as a whole, they refer to summaries of a specific aspect of a meeting, such as the DECISIONS reached, PROBLEMS discussed, PROGRESS made or ACTION ITEMS that emerged (Carenini et al. [sent-10, score-1.164]
</p><p>7 Our goal is to provide an automatic summarization system that can generate abstract-style focused meeting summaries to help users digest the vast amount of meeting content in an easy manner. [sent-12, score-0.765]
</p><p>8 Existing meeting summarization systems remain largely extractive: their summaries are comprised exclusively of patchworks of utterances selected directly from the meetings to be summa-  rized (Riedhammer et al. [sent-13, score-0.859]
</p><p>9 Although relatively easy to construct, extractive approaches fall short of producing concise and readable summaries, largely due Claire Cardie Department of Computer Science Cornell University Ithaca, NY 14853 cardie @ c s . [sent-17, score-0.191]

</p><p>21 We instantiate the abstract generation framework on two corpora from disparate domains the AMI Meeting Corpus (Mccowan et al. [sent-54, score-0.143]
</p><p>22 , 2003) and produce systems to generate focused summaries with regard to four types of meeting elements: DECISIONs, PROBLEMs, ACTION ITEMSs, and PROGRESS. [sent-56, score-0.488]

</p><p>40 Given the DA cluster to be summarized, the Content Selection module identifies a set of summary-worthy rela—  —  tion instances represented as indicator-argument pairs (i. [sent-106, score-0.141]
</p><p>41 In the first step, each relation instance is filled into templates with disparate structures that are learned automatically from the training set (Template Filling). [sent-110, score-0.302]
</p><p>42 A statistical ranker then selects one best abstract per relation instance (Statistical Ranking). [sent-111, score-0.169]
</p><p>43 Finally, selected abstracts are processed for redundancy removal in Post-Selection. [sent-112, score-0.329]
</p><p>44 4  Content Selection  Phrase-based content selection approaches have been shown to support better meeting summaries (Fern ´andez et al. [sent-114, score-0.52]
</p><p>45 Therefore, we chose a content selection representation of a finer granularity than an utterance: we identify relation instances that can both effectively detect the crucial content and incorporate enough syntactic information to facilitate the downstream surface re-  alization. [sent-116, score-0.332]
</p><p>46 A valid indicator-argument pair should have at least one content word and satisfy one of the following constraints: •  •  When the indicator is a noun, the argument hWash eton b teh a imndoidciafitoerr or complement aorfg uthme einn-t dicator. [sent-125, score-0.154]
</p><p>47 5  Surface Realization  In this section, we describe surface realization, which renders the relation instances into natural language abstracts. [sent-133, score-0.163]
</p><p>48 Once the templates are learned, the relation instances from Section 4 are filled into the templates to generate an abstract (see Section 5. [sent-136, score-0.414]
</p><p>49 Every basic or content feature is concatenated with the constituent tags of indicator and argument to compose a new one. [sent-142, score-0.224]
</p><p>50 Template extraction starts with clustering the sentences that constitute the manually generated abstracts in the training data according to their lexical and structural similarity. [sent-148, score-0.271]
</p><p>51 Intuitively, desirable templates are those that can be applied in different domains to generate the same type of focused summary (e. [sent-150, score-0.279]
</p><p>52 We also replace words that appear in both the abstract and supporting dialogue acts by a label indicating its phrase type. [sent-157, score-0.143]
</p><p>53 (4) Figure 3: Example of template extraction by MultipleSequence Alignment for problem abstracts from AMI. [sent-168, score-0.412]
</p><p>54 To transform the resulting MSAs into templates, we need to decide whether a word in the sentence should be retained to comprise the template or ab-  stracted. [sent-188, score-0.141]

</p><p>56 We also create a COARSE template that only preserves the nodes shared by all of the cluster’s sentences. [sent-193, score-0.141]
</p><p>57 Since filling the relation instances into templates of dis-  tinct structures may result in abstracts of varying quality, we rank the abstracts based on the features of the template, the transformation conducted, and the generated abstract. [sent-201, score-0.83]

<p>Author: Chen Li ; Xian Qian ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a bigram based supervised method for extractive document summarization in the integer linear programming (ILP) framework. For each bigram, a regression model is used to estimate its frequency in the reference summary. The regression model uses a variety ofindicative features and is trained discriminatively to minimize the distance between the estimated and the ground truth bigram frequency in the reference summary. During testing, the sentence selection problem is formulated as an ILP problem to maximize the bigram gains. We demonstrate that our system consistently outperforms the previous ILP method on different TAC data sets, and performs competitively compared to the best results in the TAC evaluations. We also conducted various analysis to show the impact of bigram selection, weight estimation, and ILP setup.</p><p>3 0.16187538 <a title="129-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Towards_Robust_Abstractive_Multi-Document_Summarization%3A_A_Caseframe_Analysis_of_Centrality_and_Domain.html">353 acl-2013-Towards Robust Abstractive Multi-Document Summarization: A Caseframe Analysis of Centrality and Domain</a></p>
<p>Author: Jackie Chi Kit Cheung ; Gerald Penn</p><p>Abstract: In automatic summarization, centrality is the notion that a summary should contain the core parts of the source text. Current systems use centrality, along with redundancy avoidance and some sentence compression, to produce mostly extractive summaries. In this paper, we investigate how summarization can advance past this paradigm towards robust abstraction by making greater use of the domain of the source text. We conduct a series of studies comparing human-written model summaries to system summaries at the semantic level of caseframes. We show that model summaries (1) are more abstractive and make use of more sentence aggregation, (2) do not contain as many topical caseframes as system summaries, and (3) cannot be reconstructed solely from the source text, but can be if texts from in-domain documents are added. These results suggest that substantial improvements are unlikely to result from better optimizing centrality-based criteria, but rather more domain knowledge is needed.</p><p>4 0.14599527 <a title="129-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-A_Decade_of_Automatic_Content_Evaluation_of_News_Summaries%3A_Reassessing_the_State_of_the_Art.html">5 acl-2013-A Decade of Automatic Content Evaluation of News Summaries: Reassessing the State of the Art</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter A. Rankel ; John M. Conroy ; Hoa Trang Dang ; Ani Nenkova</p><p>Abstract: How good are automatic content metrics for news summary evaluation? Here we provide a detailed answer to this question, with a particular focus on assessing the ability of automatic evaluations to identify statistically significant differences present in manual evaluation of content. Using four years of data from the Text Analysis Conference, we analyze the performance of eight ROUGE variants in terms of accuracy, precision and recall in finding significantly different systems. Our experiments show that some of the neglected variants of ROUGE, based on higher order n-grams and syntactic dependencies, are most accurate across the years; the commonly used ROUGE-1 scores find too many significant differences between systems which manual evaluation would deem comparable. We also test combinations ofROUGE variants and find that they considerably improve the accuracy of automatic prediction.</p><p>5 0.14412877 <a title="129-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-A_Sentence_Compression_Based_Framework_to_Query-Focused_Multi-Document_Summarization.html">18 acl-2013-A Sentence Compression Based Framework to Query-Focused Multi-Document Summarization</a></p>

<p>Author: Jackie Chi Kit Cheung ; Gerald Penn</p><p>Abstract: In automatic summarization, centrality is the notion that a summary should contain the core parts of the source text. Current systems use centrality, along with redundancy avoidance and some sentence compression, to produce mostly extractive summaries. In this paper, we investigate how summarization can advance past this paradigm towards robust abstraction by making greater use of the domain of the source text. We conduct a series of studies comparing human-written model summaries to system summaries at the semantic level of caseframes. We show that model summaries (1) are more abstractive and make use of more sentence aggregation, (2) do not contain as many topical caseframes as system summaries, and (3) cannot be reconstructed solely from the source text, but can be if texts from in-domain documents are added. These results suggest that substantial improvements are unlikely to result from better optimizing centrality-based criteria, but rather more domain knowledge is needed.</p><p>3 0.82787848 <a title="129-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-A_Decade_of_Automatic_Content_Evaluation_of_News_Summaries%3A_Reassessing_the_State_of_the_Art.html">5 acl-2013-A Decade of Automatic Content Evaluation of News Summaries: Reassessing the State of the Art</a></p>

<p>Author: Chen Li ; Xian Qian ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a bigram based supervised method for extractive document summarization in the integer linear programming (ILP) framework. For each bigram, a regression model is used to estimate its frequency in the reference summary. The regression model uses a variety ofindicative features and is trained discriminatively to minimize the distance between the estimated and the ground truth bigram frequency in the reference summary. During testing, the sentence selection problem is formulated as an ILP problem to maximize the bigram gains. We demonstrate that our system consistently outperforms the previous ILP method on different TAC data sets, and performs competitively compared to the best results in the TAC evaluations. We also conducted various analysis to show the impact of bigram selection, weight estimation, and ILP setup.</p><p>5 0.76165664 <a title="129-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Summarization_Through_Submodularity_and_Dispersion.html">333 acl-2013-Summarization Through Submodularity and Dispersion</a></p>

In our framework the summarization desideratum is expressed as a sum of a submodular function and a nonsubmodular function, which we call dispersion; the latter uses inter-sentence dissimilarities in different ways in order to ensure non-redundancy of the summary. We consider three natural dispersion functions and show that a greedy algorithm can obtain an approximately optimal summary in all three cases.

<p>Author: Trevor Cohn ; Gholamreza Haffari</p><p>Abstract: Modern phrase-based machine translation systems make extensive use of wordbased translation models for inducing alignments from parallel corpora. This is problematic, as the systems are incapable of accurately modelling many translation phenomena that do not decompose into word-for-word translation. This paper presents a novel method for inducing phrase-based translation units directly from parallel data, which we frame as learning an inverse transduction grammar (ITG) using a recursive Bayesian prior. Overall this leads to a model which learns translations of entire sentences, while also learning their decomposition into smaller units (phrase-pairs) recursively, terminating at word translations. Our experiments on Arabic, Urdu and Farsi to English demonstrate improvements over competitive baseline systems.</p><p>3 0.54785508 <a title="129-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Collective_Annotation_of_Linguistic_Resources%3A_Basic_Principles_and_a_Formal_Model.html">83 acl-2013-Collective Annotation of Linguistic Resources: Basic Principles and a Formal Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Ulle Endriss ; Raquel Fernandez</p><p>Abstract: Crowdsourcing, which offers new ways of cheaply and quickly gathering large amounts of information contributed by volunteers online, has revolutionised the collection of labelled data. Yet, to create annotated linguistic resources from this data, we face the challenge of having to combine the judgements of a potentially large group of annotators. In this paper we investigate how to aggregate individual annotations into a single collective annotation, taking inspiration from the field of social choice theory. We formulate a general formal model for collective annotation and propose several aggregation methods that go beyond the commonly used majority rule. We test some of our methods on data from a crowdsourcing experiment on textual entailment annotation.</p><p>4 0.54655939 <a title="129-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-A_Sentence_Compression_Based_Framework_to_Query-Focused_Multi-Document_Summarization.html">18 acl-2013-A Sentence Compression Based Framework to Query-Focused Multi-Document Summarization</a></p>

<p>Author: Alessandro Valitutti ; Hannu Toivonen ; Antoine Doucet ; Jukka M. Toivanen</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for automated generation of adult humor by lexical replacement and present empirical evaluation results of the obtained humor. We propose three types of lexical constraints as building blocks of humorous word substitution: constraints concerning the similarity of sounds or spellings of the original word and the substitute, a constraint requiring the substitute to be a taboo word, and constraints concerning the position and context of the replacement. Empirical evidence from extensive user studies indicates that these constraints can increase the effectiveness of humor generation significantly.</p><p>3 0.05727319 <a title="371-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Models_of_Semantic_Representation_with_Visual_Attributes.html">249 acl-2013-Models of Semantic Representation with Visual Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Carina Silberer ; Vittorio Ferrari ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of grounding the meaning of words in the physical world and focus on the visual modality which we represent by visual attributes. We create a new large-scale taxonomy of visual attributes covering more than 500 concepts and their corresponding 688K images. We use this dataset to train attribute classifiers and integrate their predictions with text-based distributional models of word meaning. We show that these bimodal models give a better fit to human word association data compared to amodal models and word representations based on handcrafted norming data.</p><p>4 0.0564043 <a title="371-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Using_Conceptual_Class_Attributes_to_Characterize_Social_Media_Users.html">373 acl-2013-Using Conceptual Class Attributes to Characterize Social Media Users</a></p>
<p>Author: Shane Bergsma ; Benjamin Van Durme</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel approach for automatically predicting the hidden demographic properties of social media users. Building on prior work in common-sense knowledge acquisition from third-person text, we first learn the distinguishing attributes of certain classes of people. For example, we learn that people in the Female class tend to have maiden names and engagement rings. We then show that this knowledge can be used in the analysis of first-person communication; knowledge of distinguishing attributes allows us to both classify users and to bootstrap new training examples. Our novel approach enables substantial improvements on the widelystudied task of user gender prediction, ob- taining a 20% relative error reduction over the current state-of-the-art.</p><p>5 0.039230652 <a title="371-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Random_Walk_Factoid_Annotation_for_Collective_Discourse.html">293 acl-2013-Random Walk Factoid Annotation for Collective Discourse</a></p>
<p>Author: Ben King ; Rahul Jha ; Dragomir Radev ; Robert Mankoff</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of automatically annotating the factoids present in collective discourse. Factoids are information units that are shared between instances of collective discourse and may have many different ways ofbeing realized in words. Our approach divides this problem into two steps, using a graph-based approach for each step: (1) factoid discovery, finding groups of words that correspond to the same factoid, and (2) factoid assignment, using these groups of words to mark collective discourse units that contain the respective factoids. We study this on two novel data sets: the New Yorker caption contest data set, and the crossword clues data set.</p><p>6 0.0351207 <a title="371-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Align%2C_Disambiguate_and_Walk%3A_A_Unified_Approach_for_Measuring_Semantic_Similarity.html">43 acl-2013-Align, Disambiguate and Walk: A Unified Approach for Measuring Semantic Similarity</a></p>

<p>Author: Sean Szumlanski ; Fernando Gomez ; Valerie K. Sims</p><p>Abstract: We have elicited human quantitative judgments of semantic relatedness for 122 pairs of nouns and compiled them into a new set of relatedness norms that we call Rel-122. Judgments from individual subjects in our study exhibit high average correlation to the resulting relatedness means (r = 0.77, σ = 0.09, N = 73), although not as high as Resnik’s (1995) upper bound for expected average human correlation to similarity means (r = 0.90). This suggests that human perceptions of relatedness are less strictly constrained than perceptions of similarity and establishes a clearer expectation for what constitutes human-like performance by a computational measure of semantic relatedness. We compare the results of several WordNet-based similarity and relatedness measures to our Rel-122 norms and demonstrate the limitations of WordNet for discovering general indications of semantic relatedness. We also offer a critique of the field’s reliance upon similarity norms to evaluate relatedness measures.</p><p>4 0.55892444 <a title="371-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Offspring_from_Reproduction_Problems%3A_What_Replication_Failure_Teaches_Us.html">262 acl-2013-Offspring from Reproduction Problems: What Replication Failure Teaches Us</a></p>
<p>Author: Antske Fokkens ; Marieke van Erp ; Marten Postma ; Ted Pedersen ; Piek Vossen ; Nuno Freire</p><p>Abstract: Repeating experiments is an important instrument in the scientific toolbox to validate previous work and build upon existing work. We present two concrete use cases involving key techniques in the NLP domain for which we show that reproducing results is still difficult. We show that the deviation that can be found in reproduction efforts leads to questions about how our results should be interpreted. Moreover, investigating these deviations provides new insights and a deeper understanding of the examined techniques. We identify five aspects that can influence the outcomes of experiments that are typically not addressed in research papers. Our use cases show that these aspects may change the answer to research questions leading us to conclude that more care should be taken in interpreting our results and more research involving systematic testing of methods is required in our field.</p><p>5 0.55181837 <a title="371-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Identifying_Bad_Semantic_Neighbors_for_Improving_Distributional_Thesauri.html">185 acl-2013-Identifying Bad Semantic Neighbors for Improving Distributional Thesauri</a></p>
<p>Author: Olivier Ferret</p><p>Abstract: Distributional thesauri are now widely used in a large number of Natural Language Processing tasks. However, they are far from containing only interesting semantic relations. As a consequence, improving such thesaurus is an important issue that is mainly tackled indirectly through the improvement of semantic similarity measures. In this article, we propose a more direct approach focusing on the identification of the neighbors of a thesaurus entry that are not semantically linked to this entry. This identification relies on a discriminative classifier trained from unsupervised selected examples for building a distributional model of the entry in texts. Its bad neighbors are found by applying this classifier to a representative set of occurrences of each of these neighbors. We evaluate the interest of this method for a large set of English nouns with various frequencies.</p><p>6 0.54027623 <a title="371-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-PLIS%3A_a_Probabilistic_Lexical_Inference_System.html">269 acl-2013-PLIS: a Probabilistic Lexical Inference System</a></p>

<p>Author: Anoop Kunchukuttan ; Rajen Chatterjee ; Shourya Roy ; Abhijit Mishra ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: Large amount of parallel corpora is required for building Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems. We describe the TransDoop system for gathering translations to create parallel corpora from online crowd workforce who have familiarity with multiple languages but are not expert translators. Our system uses a Map-Reduce-like approach to translation crowdsourcing where sentence translation is decomposed into the following smaller tasks: (a) translation ofconstituent phrases of the sentence; (b) validation of quality of the phrase translations; and (c) composition of complete sentence translations from phrase translations. Trans- Doop incorporates quality control mechanisms and easy-to-use worker user interfaces designed to address issues with translation crowdsourcing. We have evaluated the crowd’s output using the METEOR metric. For a complex domain like judicial proceedings, the higher scores obtained by the map-reduce based approach compared to complete sentence translation establishes the efficacy of our work.</p><p>5 0.58645242 <a title="371-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Stop-probability_estimates_computed_on_a_large_corpus_improve_Unsupervised_Dependency_Parsing.html">331 acl-2013-Stop-probability estimates computed on a large corpus improve Unsupervised Dependency Parsing</a></p>

By incorporating this knowledge into Dependency Model with Valence, we managed to considerably outperform the state-of-theart results in terms of average attachment score over 20 treebanks from CoNLL 2006 and 2007 shared tasks.</p><p>6 0.55107039 <a title="371-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-%22Let_Everything_Turn_Well_in_Your_Wife%22%3A_Generation_of_Adult_Humor_Using_Lexical_Constraints.html">1 acl-2013-"Let Everything Turn Well in Your Wife": Generation of Adult Humor Using Lexical Constraints</a></p>

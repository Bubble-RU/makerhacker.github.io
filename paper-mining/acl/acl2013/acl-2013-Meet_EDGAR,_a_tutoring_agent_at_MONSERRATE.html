<p>Author: Veronica Perez-Rosas ; Rada Mihalcea ; Louis-Philippe Morency</p><p>Abstract: During real-life interactions, people are naturally gesturing and modulating their voice to emphasize specific points or to express their emotions. With the recent growth of social websites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Amazon, video reviews are emerging as a new source of multimodal and natural opinions that has been left almost untapped by automatic opinion analysis techniques. This paper presents a method for multimodal sentiment classification, which can identify the sentiment expressed in utterance-level visual datastreams. Using a new multimodal dataset consisting of sentiment annotated utterances extracted from video reviews, we show that multimodal sentiment analysis can be effectively performed, and that the joint use of visual, acoustic, and linguistic modalities can lead to error rate reductions of up to 10.5% as compared to the best performing individual modality.</p><p>3 0.11525829 <a title="239-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-AnnoMarket%3A_An_Open_Cloud_Platform_for_NLP.html">51 acl-2013-AnnoMarket: An Open Cloud Platform for NLP</a></p>
<p>Author: Valentin Tablan ; Kalina Bontcheva ; Ian Roberts ; Hamish Cunningham ; Marin Dimitrov</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents AnnoMarket, an open cloud-based platform which enables researchers to deploy, share, and use language processing components and resources, following the data-as-a-service and software-as-a-service paradigms. The focus is on multilingual text analysis resources and services, based on an opensource infrastructure and compliant with relevant NLP standards. We demonstrate how the AnnoMarket platform can be used to develop NLP applications with little or no programming, to index the results for enhanced browsing and search, and to evaluate performance. Utilising AnnoMarket is straightforward, since cloud infrastructural issues are dealt with by the platform, completely transparently to the user: load balancing, efficient data upload and storage, deployment on the virtual machines, security, and fault tolerance.</p><p>4 0.099340677 <a title="239-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Parsing_Graphs_with_Hyperedge_Replacement_Grammars.html">274 acl-2013-Parsing Graphs with Hyperedge Replacement Grammars</a></p>
<p>Author: David Chiang ; Jacob Andreas ; Daniel Bauer ; Karl Moritz Hermann ; Bevan Jones ; Kevin Knight</p><p>Abstract: Hyperedge replacement grammar (HRG) is a formalism for generating and transforming graphs that has potential applications in natural language understanding and generation. A recognition algorithm due to Lautemann is known to be polynomial-time for graphs that are connected and of bounded degree. We present a more precise characterization of the algorithm’s complexity, an optimization analogous to binarization of contextfree grammars, and some important implementation details, resulting in an algorithm that is practical for natural-language applications. The algorithm is part of Bolinas, a new software toolkit for HRG processing.</p><p>5 0.09547428 <a title="239-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Incremental_Topic-Based_Translation_Model_Adaptation_for_Conversational_Spoken_Language_Translation.html">197 acl-2013-Incremental Topic-Based Translation Model Adaptation for Conversational Spoken Language Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Sanjika Hewavitharana ; Dennis Mehay ; Sankaranarayanan Ananthakrishnan ; Prem Natarajan</p><p>Abstract: We describe a translation model adaptation approach for conversational spoken language translation (CSLT), which encourages the use of contextually appropriate translation options from relevant training conversations. Our approach employs a monolingual LDA topic model to derive a similarity measure between the test conversation and the set of training conversations, which is used to bias translation choices towards the current context. A significant novelty of our adaptation technique is its incremental nature; we continuously update the topic distribution on the evolving test conversation as new utterances become available. Thus, our approach is well-suited to the causal constraint of spoken conversations. On an English-to-Iraqi CSLT task, the proposed approach gives significant improvements over a baseline system as measured by BLEU, TER, and NIST. Interestingly, the incremental approach outperforms a non-incremental oracle that has up-front knowledge of the whole conversation.</p><p>6 0.088516101 <a title="239-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Is_word-to-phone_mapping_better_than_phone-phone_mapping_for_handling_English_words%3F.html">203 acl-2013-Is word-to-phone mapping better than phone-phone mapping for handling English words?</a></p>

<p>Author: Georgios Kontonatsios ; Paul Thompson ; Riza Theresa Batista-Navarro ; Claudiu Mihaila ; Ioannis Korkontzelos ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: U-Compare is a UIMA-based workflow construction platform for building natural language processing (NLP) applications from heterogeneous language resources (LRs), without the need for programming skills. U-Compare has been adopted within the context of the METANET Network of Excellence, and over 40 LRs that process 15 European languages have been added to the U-Compare component library. In line with METANET’s aims of increasing communication between citizens of different European countries, U-Compare has been extended to facilitate the development of a wider range of applications, including both mul- tilingual and multimodal workflows. The enhancements exploit the UIMA Subject of Analysis (Sofa) mechanism, that allows different facets of the input data to be represented. We demonstrate how our customised extensions to U-Compare allow the construction and testing of NLP applications that transform the input data in different ways, e.g., machine translation, automatic summarisation and text-to-speech.</p><p>3 0.59650141 <a title="239-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Evaluating_a_City_Exploration_Dialogue_System_with_Integrated_Question-Answering_and_Pedestrian_Navigation.html">141 acl-2013-Evaluating a City Exploration Dialogue System with Integrated Question-Answering and Pedestrian Navigation</a></p>
<p>Author: Srinivasan Janarthanam ; Oliver Lemon ; Phil Bartie ; Tiphaine Dalmas ; Anna Dickinson ; Xingkun Liu ; William Mackaness ; Bonnie Webber</p><p>Abstract: We present a city navigation and tourist information mobile dialogue app with integrated question-answering (QA) and geographic information system (GIS) modules that helps pedestrian users to navigate in and learn about urban environments. In contrast to existing mobile apps which treat these problems independently, our Android app addresses the problem of navigation and touristic questionanswering in an integrated fashion using a shared dialogue context. We evaluated our system in comparison with Samsung S-Voice (which interfaces to Google navigation and Google search) with 17 users and found that users judged our system to be significantly more interesting to interact with and learn from. They also rated our system above Google search (with the Samsung S-Voice interface) for tourist information tasks.</p><p>4 0.58226383 <a title="239-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-PAL%3A_A_Chatterbot_System_for_Answering_Domain-specific_Questions.html">266 acl-2013-PAL: A Chatterbot System for Answering Domain-specific Questions</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuanchao Liu ; Ming Liu ; Xiaolong Wang ; Limin Wang ; Jingjing Li</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose PAL, a prototype chatterbot for answering non-obstructive psychological domain-specific questions. This system focuses on providing primary suggestions or helping people relieve pressure by extracting knowledge from online forums, based on which the chatterbot system is constructed. The strategies used by PAL, including semantic-extension-based question matching, solution management with personal information consideration, and XML-based knowledge pattern construction, are described and discussed. We also conduct a primary test for the feasibility of our system.</p><p>5 0.58154839 <a title="239-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Development_and_Analysis_of_NLP_Pipelines_in_Argo.html">118 acl-2013-Development and Analysis of NLP Pipelines in Argo</a></p>
<p>Author: Rafal Rak ; Andrew Rowley ; Jacob Carter ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: Developing sophisticated NLP pipelines composed of multiple processing tools and components available through different providers may pose a challenge in terms of their interoperability. The Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) is an industry standard whose aim is to ensure such interoperability by defining common data structures and interfaces. The architecture has been gaining attention from industry and academia alike, resulting in a large volume ofUIMA-compliant processing components. In this paper, we demonstrate Argo, a Web-based workbench for the development and processing of NLP pipelines/workflows. The workbench is based upon UIMA, and thus has the potential of using many of the existing UIMA resources. We present features, and show examples, offacilitating the distributed development of components and the analysis of processing results. The latter includes annotation visualisers and editors, as well as serialisation to RDF format, which enables flexible querying in addition to data manipulation thanks to the semantic query language SPARQL. The distributed development feature allows users to seamlessly connect their tools to workflows running in Argo, and thus take advantage of both the available library of components (without the need of installing them locally) and the analytical tools.</p><p>6 0.57121897 <a title="239-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Sign_Language_Lexical_Recognition_With_Propositional_Dynamic_Logic.html">321 acl-2013-Sign Language Lexical Recognition With Propositional Dynamic Logic</a></p>

<p>Author: Huanhuan Liu ; Shoushan Li ; Guodong Zhou ; Chu-ren Huang ; Peifeng Li</p><p>Abstract: Emotion classification can be generally done from both the writer’s and reader’s perspectives. In this study, we find that two foundational tasks in emotion classification, i.e., reader’s emotion classification on the news and writer’s emotion classification on the comments, are strongly related to each other in terms of coarse-grained emotion categories, i.e., negative and positive. On the basis, we propose a respective way to jointly model these two tasks. In particular, a cotraining algorithm is proposed to improve semi-supervised learning of the two tasks.

A diverse ensemble of weak learners is created using the same SMT engine (a hierarchical phrase-based system) by manipulating the training data and a strong model is created by combining the weak models on-the-fly. Experimental results on two language pairs and three different sizes of training data show significant improvements of up to 4 BLEU points over a conventionally trained SMT model.</p><p>4 0.53299999 <a title="239-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Arguments_and_Modifiers_from_the_Learner%27s_Perspective.html">57 acl-2013-Arguments and Modifiers from the Learner's Perspective</a></p>
<p>Author: Leon Bergen ; Edward Gibson ; Timothy J. O'Donnell</p><p>Abstract: We present a model for inducing sentential argument structure, which distinguishes arguments from optional modifiers. We use this model to study whether representing an argument/modifier distinction helps in learning argument structure, and whether a linguistically-natural argument/modifier distinction can be induced from distributional data alone. Our results provide evidence for both hypotheses.</p><p>5 0.51096839 <a title="239-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Generating_Synthetic_Comparable_Questions_for_News_Articles.html">169 acl-2013-Generating Synthetic Comparable Questions for News Articles</a></p>
<p>Author: Oleg Rokhlenko ; Idan Szpektor</p><p>Abstract: We introduce the novel task of automatically generating questions that are relevant to a text but do not appear in it. One motivating example of its application is for increasing user engagement around news articles by suggesting relevant comparable questions, such as “is Beyonce a better singer than Madonna?”, for the user to answer. We present the first algorithm for the task, which consists of: (a) offline construction of a comparable question template database; (b) ranking of relevant templates to a given article; and (c) instantiation of templates only with entities in the article whose comparison under the template’s relation makes sense. We tested the suggestions generated by our algorithm via a Mechanical Turk experiment, which showed a significant improvement over the strongest baseline of more than 45% in all metrics.</p><p>6 0.47133043 <a title="239-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Dual_Training_and_Dual_Prediction_for_Polarity_Classification.html">131 acl-2013-Dual Training and Dual Prediction for Polarity Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Arjun Mukherjee ; Vivek Venkataraman ; Bing Liu ; Sharon Meraz</p><p>Abstract: Social media platforms have enabled people to freely express their views and discuss issues of interest with others. While it is important to discover the topics in discussions, it is equally useful to mine the nature of such discussions or debates and the behavior of the participants. There are many questions that can be asked. One key question is whether the participants give reasoned arguments with justifiable claims via constructive debates or exhibit dogmatism and egotistic clashes of ideologies. The central idea of this question is tolerance, which is a key concept in the field of communications. In this work, we perform a computational study of tolerance in the context of online discussions. We aim to identify tolerant vs. intolerant participants and investigate how disagreement affects tolerance in discussions in a quantitative framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such study. Our experiments using real-life discussions demonstrate the effective- ness of the proposed technique and also provide some key insights into the psycholinguistic phenomenon of tolerance in online discussions.</p><p>3 0.28942594 <a title="121-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Extra-Linguistic_Constraints_on_Stance_Recognition_in_Ideological_Debates.html">151 acl-2013-Extra-Linguistic Constraints on Stance Recognition in Ideological Debates</a></p>
<p>Author: Kazi Saidul Hasan ; Vincent Ng</p><p>Abstract: Determining the stance expressed by an author from a post written for a twosided debate in an online debate forum is a relatively new problem. We seek to improve Anand et al.’s (201 1) approach to debate stance classification by modeling two types of soft extra-linguistic constraints on the stance labels of debate posts, user-interaction constraints and ideology constraints. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of these inter-post constraints in improving debate stance classification.</p><p>4 0.21284378 <a title="121-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Sentiment_Relevance.html">318 acl-2013-Sentiment Relevance</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian Scheible ; Hinrich Schutze</p><p>Abstract: A number of different notions, including subjectivity, have been proposed for distinguishing parts of documents that convey sentiment from those that do not. We propose a new concept, sentiment relevance, to make this distinction and argue that it better reflects the requirements of sentiment analysis systems. We demonstrate experimentally that sentiment relevance and subjectivity are related, but different. Since no large amount of labeled training data for our new notion of sentiment relevance is available, we investigate two semi-supervised methods for creating sentiment relevance classifiers: a distant supervision approach that leverages structured information about the domain of the reviews; and transfer learning on feature representations based on lexical taxonomies that enables knowledge transfer. We show that both methods learn sentiment relevance classifiers that perform well.</p><p>5 0.21162018 <a title="121-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Identifying_Opinion_Subgroups_in_Arabic_Online_Discussions.html">187 acl-2013-Identifying Opinion Subgroups in Arabic Online Discussions</a></p>
<p>Author: Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Ben King ; Mona Diab ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we use Arabic natural language processing techniques to analyze Arabic debates. The goal is to identify how the participants in a discussion split into subgroups with contrasting opinions. The members of each subgroup share the same opinion with respect to the discussion topic and an opposing opinion to the members of other subgroups. We use opinion mining techniques to identify opinion expressions and determine their polarities and their targets. We opinion predictions to represent the discussion in one of two formal representations: signed attitude network or a space of attitude vectors. We identify opinion subgroups by partitioning the signed network representation or by clustering the vector space representation. We evaluate the system using a data set of labeled discussions and show that it achieves good results.</p><p>6 0.20216711 <a title="121-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-A_Bayesian_Model_for_Joint_Unsupervised_Induction_of_Sentiment%2C_Aspect_and_Discourse_Representations.html">2 acl-2013-A Bayesian Model for Joint Unsupervised Induction of Sentiment, Aspect and Discourse Representations</a></p>

<p>Author: Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil ; Moritz Sudhof ; Dan Jurafsky ; Jure Leskovec ; Christopher Potts</p><p>Abstract: We propose a computational framework for identifying linguistic aspects of politeness. Our starting point is a new corpus of requests annotated for politeness, which we use to evaluate aspects of politeness theory and to uncover new interactions between politeness markers and context. These findings guide our construction of a classifier with domain-independent lexical and syntactic features operationalizing key components of politeness theory, such as indirection, deference, impersonalization and modality. Our classifier achieves close to human performance and is effective across domains. We use our framework to study the relationship between po- liteness and social power, showing that polite Wikipedia editors are more likely to achieve high status through elections, but, once elevated, they become less polite. We see a similar negative correlation between politeness and power on Stack Exchange, where users at the top of the reputation scale are less polite than those at the bottom. Finally, we apply our classifier to a preliminary analysis of politeness variation by gender and community.</p><p>5 0.68134439 <a title="121-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-An_annotated_corpus_of_quoted_opinions_in_news_articles.html">49 acl-2013-An annotated corpus of quoted opinions in news articles</a></p>
<p>Author: Tim O'Keefe ; James R. Curran ; Peter Ashwell ; Irena Koprinska</p><p>Abstract: Quotes are used in news articles as evidence of a person’s opinion, and thus are a useful target for opinion mining. However, labelling each quote with a polarity score directed at a textually-anchored target can ignore the broader issue that the speaker is commenting on. We address this by instead labelling quotes as supporting or opposing a clear expression of a point of view on a topic, called a position statement. Using this we construct a corpus covering 7 topics with 2,228 quotes.</p><p>6 0.61421645 <a title="121-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Linguistic_Models_for_Analyzing_and_Detecting_Biased_Language.html">232 acl-2013-Linguistic Models for Analyzing and Detecting Biased Language</a></p>

<p>Author: Abhijit Mishra ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya ; Michael Carl</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce Translation Difficulty Index (TDI), a measure of difficulty in text translation. We first define and quantify translation difficulty in terms of TDI. We realize that any measure of TDI based on direct input by translators is fraught with subjectivity and adhocism. We, rather, rely on cognitive evidences from eye tracking. TDI is measured as the sum of fixation (gaze) and saccade (rapid eye movement) times of the eye. We then establish that TDI is correlated with three properties of the input sentence, viz. length (L), degree of polysemy (DP) and structural complexity (SC). We train a Support Vector Regression (SVR) system to predict TDIs for new sentences using these features as input. The prediction done by our framework is well correlated with the empirical gold standard data, which is a repository of < L, DP, SC > and TDI pairs for a set of sentences. The primary use of our work is a way of “binning” sentences (to be translated) in “easy”, “medium” and “hard” categories as per their predicted TDI. This can decide pricing of any translation task, especially useful in a scenario where parallel corpora for Machine Translation are built through translation crowdsourcing/outsourcing. This can also provide a way of monitoring progress of second language learners.</p><p>2 0.91720527 <a title="121-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Detecting_Metaphor_by_Contextual_Analogy.html">116 acl-2013-Detecting Metaphor by Contextual Analogy</a></p>

<p>Author: Zornitsa Kozareva</p><p>Abstract: Metaphor is an important way of conveying the affect of people, hence understanding how people use metaphors to convey affect is important for the communication between individuals and increases cohesion if the perceived affect of the concrete example is the same for the two individuals. Therefore, building computational models that can automatically identify the affect in metaphor-rich texts like “The team captain is a rock.”, “Time is money.”, “My lawyer is a shark.” is an important challenging problem, which has been of great interest to the research community. To solve this task, we have collected and manually annotated the affect of metaphor-rich texts for four languages. We present novel algorithms that integrate triggers for cognitive, affective, perceptual and social processes with stylistic and lexical information. By running evaluations on datasets in English, Spanish, Russian and Farsi, we show that the developed affect polarity and valence prediction technology of metaphor-rich texts is portable and works equally well for different languages.</p><p>4 0.89788675 <a title="121-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Beam_Search_for_Solving_Substitution_Ciphers.html">66 acl-2013-Beam Search for Solving Substitution Ciphers</a></p>

We show experiments with 1:1 substitution ciphers in which the guaranteed optimal solution for 3-gram language models has 38.6% decipherment error, while our approach achieves 4.13% decipherment error in a fraction of time by using a 6-gram language model. We also apply our approach to the famous Zodiac-408 cipher and obtain slightly bet- ter (and near to optimal) results than previously published. Unlike the previous state-of-the-art approach that uses additional word lists to evaluate possible decipherments, our approach only uses a letterbased 6-gram language model. Furthermore we use our algorithm to solve large vocabulary substitution ciphers and improve the best published decipherment error rate based on the Gigaword corpus of 7.8% to 6.0% error rate.</p><p>same-paper 5 0.88964266 <a title="121-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Discovering_User_Interactions_in_Ideological_Discussions.html">121 acl-2013-Discovering User Interactions in Ideological Discussions</a></p>
<p>Author: Arjun Mukherjee ; Bing Liu</p><p>Abstract: Online discussion forums are a popular platform for people to voice their opinions on any subject matter and to discuss or debate any issue of interest. In forums where users discuss social, political, or religious issues, there are often heated debates among users or participants. Existing research has studied mining of user stances or camps on certain issues, opposing perspectives, and contention points. In this paper, we focus on identifying the nature of interactions among user pairs. The central questions are: How does each pair of users interact with each other? Does the pair of users mostly agree or disagree? What is the lexicon that people often use to express agreement and disagreement? We present a topic model based approach to answer these questions. Since agreement and disagreement expressions are usually multiword phrases, we propose to employ a ranking method to identify highly relevant phrases prior to topic modeling. After modeling, we use the modeling results to classify the nature of interaction of each user pair. Our evaluation results using real-life discussion/debate posts demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.</p><p>6 0.88907391 <a title="121-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Joint_Word_Alignment_and_Bilingual_Named_Entity_Recognition_Using_Dual_Decomposition.html">210 acl-2013-Joint Word Alignment and Bilingual Named Entity Recognition Using Dual Decomposition</a></p>

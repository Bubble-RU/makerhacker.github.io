<p>Author: Angeliki Lazaridou ; Ivan Titov ; Caroline Sporleder</p><p>Abstract: We propose a joint model for unsupervised induction of sentiment, aspect and discourse information and show that by incorporating a notion of latent discourse relations in the model, we improve the prediction accuracy for aspect and sentiment polarity on the sub-sentential level. We deviate from the traditional view of discourse, as we induce types of discourse relations and associated discourse cues relevant to the considered opinion analysis task; consequently, the induced discourse relations play the role of opinion and aspect shifters. The quantitative analysis that we conducted indicated that the integration of a discourse model increased the prediction accuracy results with respect to the discourse-agnostic approach and the qualitative analysis suggests that the induced representations encode a meaningful discourse structure.</p><p>3 0.41483709 <a title="188-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Sentiment_Relevance.html">318 acl-2013-Sentiment Relevance</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian Scheible ; Hinrich Schutze</p><p>Abstract: A number of different notions, including subjectivity, have been proposed for distinguishing parts of documents that convey sentiment from those that do not. We propose a new concept, sentiment relevance, to make this distinction and argue that it better reflects the requirements of sentiment analysis systems. We demonstrate experimentally that sentiment relevance and subjectivity are related, but different. Since no large amount of labeled training data for our new notion of sentiment relevance is available, we investigate two semi-supervised methods for creating sentiment relevance classifiers: a distant supervision approach that leverages structured information about the domain of the reviews; and transfer learning on feature representations based on lexical taxonomies that enables knowledge transfer. We show that both methods learn sentiment relevance classifiers that perform well.</p><p>4 0.35784781 <a title="188-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Exploring_Sentiment_in_Social_Media%3A_Bootstrapping_Subjectivity_Clues_from_Multilingual_Twitter_Streams.html">148 acl-2013-Exploring Sentiment in Social Media: Bootstrapping Subjectivity Clues from Multilingual Twitter Streams</a></p>

<p>Author: Ankit Ramteke ; Akshat Malu ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya ; J. Saketha Nath</p><p>Abstract: Thwarting and sarcasm are two uncharted territories in sentiment analysis, the former because of the lack of training corpora and the latter because of the enormous amount of world knowledge it demands. In this paper, we propose a working definition of thwarting amenable to machine learning and create a system that detects if the document is thwarted or not. We focus on identifying thwarting in product reviews, especially in the camera domain. An ontology of the camera domain is created. Thwarting is looked upon as the phenomenon of polarity reversal at a higher level of ontology compared to the polarity expressed at the lower level. This notion of thwarting defined with respect to an ontology is novel, to the best of our knowledge. A rule based implementation building upon this idea forms our baseline. We show that machine learning with annotated corpora (thwarted/nonthwarted) is more effective than the rule based system. Because of the skewed distribution of thwarting, we adopt the Areaunder-the-Curve measure of performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at the difficult problem of thwarting detection, which we hope will at Akshat Malu Dept. of Computer Science & Engg., Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India. akshatmalu@ cse .i itb .ac .in J.

<p>Author: Reut Tsarfaty</p><p>Abstract: Stanford Dependencies (SD) provide a functional characterization of the grammatical relations in syntactic parse-trees. The SD representation is useful for parser evaluation, for downstream applications, and, ultimately, for natural language understanding, however, the design of SD focuses on structurally-marked relations and under-represents morphosyntactic realization patterns observed in Morphologically Rich Languages (MRLs). We present a novel extension of SD, called Unified-SD (U-SD), which unifies the annotation of structurally- and morphologically-marked relations via an inheritance hierarchy. We create a new resource composed of U-SDannotated constituency and dependency treebanks for the MRL Modern Hebrew, and present two systems that can automatically predict U-SD annotations, for gold segmented input as well as raw texts, with high baseline accuracy.</p><p>2 0.76569605 <a title="188-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-A_Novel_Classifier_Based_on_Quantum_Computation.html">14 acl-2013-A Novel Classifier Based on Quantum Computation</a></p>

<p>Author: Vidhya Govindaraju ; Ce Zhang ; Christopher Re</p><p>Abstract: Tabular information in text documents contains a wealth of information, and so tables are a natural candidate for information extraction. There are many cues buried in both a table and its surrounding text that allow us to understand the meaning of the data in a table. We study how natural-language tools, such as part-of-speech tagging, dependency paths, and named-entity recognition, can be used to improve the quality of relation extraction from tables. In three domains we show that (1) a model that performs joint probabilistic inference across tabular and natural language features achieves an F1 score that is twice as high as either a puretable or pure-text system, and (2) using only shallower features or non-joint inference results in lower quality.</p><p>5 0.70440471 <a title="188-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Adaptive_Parser-Centric_Text_Normalization.html">37 acl-2013-Adaptive Parser-Centric Text Normalization</a></p>
<p>Author: Congle Zhang ; Tyler Baldwin ; Howard Ho ; Benny Kimelfeld ; Yunyao Li</p><p>Abstract: Text normalization is an important first step towards enabling many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks over informal text. While many of these tasks, such as parsing, perform the best over fully grammatically correct text, most existing text normalization approaches narrowly define the task in the word-to-word sense; that is, the task is seen as that of mapping all out-of-vocabulary non-standard words to their in-vocabulary standard forms. In this paper, we take a parser-centric view of normalization that aims to convert raw informal text into grammatically correct text. To understand the real effect of normalization on the parser, we tie normal- ization performance directly to parser performance. Additionally, we design a customizable framework to address the often overlooked concept of domain adaptability, and illustrate that the system allows for transfer to new domains with a minimal amount of data and effort. Our experimental study over datasets from three domains demonstrates that our approach outperforms not only the state-of-the-art wordto-word normalization techniques, but also manual word-to-word annotations.</p><p>6 0.68094957 <a title="188-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Compositional-ly_Derived_Representations_of_Morphologically_Complex_Words_in_Distributional_Semantics.html">87 acl-2013-Compositional-ly Derived Representations of Morphologically Complex Words in Distributional Semantics</a></p>

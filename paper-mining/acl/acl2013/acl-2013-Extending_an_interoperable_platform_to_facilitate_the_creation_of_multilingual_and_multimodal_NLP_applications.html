</p><p>5 We demonstrate how our customised extensions to U-Compare allow the construction and testing of NLP applications that transform the input data in different ways, e. [sent-8, score-0.327]
</p><p>6 1 Introduction Currently, there are many repositories that contain a range of NLP components, e. [sent-11, score-0.068]
</p><p>7 The ability to chain components from these repositories into pipelines is a prerequisite to facilitate the development of ∗The authors have contributed equally to the development complex NLP applications. [sent-14, score-0.311]
</p><p>8 Combining together heterogeneous components is not, however, always straightforward. [sent-15, score-0.204]
</p><p>9 The various components  used in a pipeline may be implemented using different programming languages, may have incompatible input/output formats, e. [sent-16, score-0.167]
</p><p>10 It is a framework that facilitates the straightforward combination of LRs, i. [sent-23, score-0.06]
</p><p>11 UIMA is an OASIS standard that enables interoperability of LRs by defining a standard workflow metadata format and standard input/output representations. [sent-26, score-0.512]
</p><p>12 , 2011) is a graphical NLP workflow construction platform built on top  of UIMA. [sent-28, score-0.53]
</p><p>13 It facilitates the rapid construction, testing and evaluation of NLP workflows using dragand-drop actions within its graphical user interface (GUI). [sent-29, score-0.358]
</p><p>14 U-Compare enhances interoperability among UIMA-compliant LRs, by defining a common and sharable Type System, i. [sent-30, score-0.195]
</p><p>15 The aim is for all components in U-Compare’s library to be compliant with this  ofth321h ist p w: o/ r /onwklp wae. [sent-35, score-0.236]
</p><p>16 php  which are compliant  with the same type system. [sent-49, score-0.06]
</p><p>17 c e2 A0s1s3oc Aiastsioocnia fotiron C foomrp Cuotmatpiountaatlio Lninaglu Liisntgicusi,s ptaicgses 43–48,  This makes U-Compare the world’s largest repository of type system-compatible LRs, allowing users to seamlessly combine together resources to create a range of NLP applications. [sent-52, score-0.063]
</p><p>18 Previously, U-Compare was able to support the development of a wide range of monolingual lexical, syntactic and semantic processing tasks applications that enriched textual input documents  by adding annotations of various types. [sent-53, score-0.265]
</p><p>19 However, not all NLP applications operate in this way; some workflows transform the input data to create new “views” ofthe input data. [sent-54, score-0.46]
</p><p>20 This aim implies the development of both multilingual applications, which transform input data from one language into another, or multimodal applications, in which text may be transformed into speech, or vice versa. [sent-56, score-0.411]
</p><p>21 U-Compare has been extended in several ways to support the construction of these more complex workflow types. [sent-57, score-0.433]
</p><p>22 Secondly, workflows that output audio as well as textual views, e. [sent-61, score-0.537]
</p><p>23 2  Related work  Over the past few years, an increasing numbers of researchers have begun to create and distribute their own workflow construction architectures (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004; Cunningham et al. [sent-64, score-0.433]
</p><p>24 , 2002) is a workflow construction framework that has been used to develop several types of NLP applications, including summarisation systems. [sent-71, score-0.612]
</p><p>25 It facilitates the development of a wide range of NLP applications by providing a collection of components that can process various languages, together with Java libraries that handle character encoding for approximately 100  languages. [sent-72, score-0.409]
</p><p>26 However, GATE does not formally define any standards to model multilingual or multimodal applications, but rather aims to boost the development process of NLP applications. [sent-73, score-0.303]
</p><p>27 , 1997) is a generic framework for the development of NLP applications. [sent-75, score-0.052]
</p><p>28 TIPSTER provides multilingual functionalities by associating text segments of a parallel document with one or more languages. [sent-76, score-0.139]
</p><p>29 This allows language-dependent NLP components to process only the appropriate mono-lingual subdocuments. [sent-77, score-0.138]
</p><p>30 This lack of a common and sharable system of annotation types discourages interoperability between LRs. [sent-79, score-0.227]
</p><p>31 However, TIPSTER does not provide a mechanism that facilitates the development of multilingual or multimodal NLP applications. [sent-80, score-0.418]
</p><p>32 Heart of Gold (Sch a¨fer, 2006) is an XMLbased workflow construction architecture that enables interoperability of tools developed in different programming languages to be combined  into pipelines. [sent-81, score-0.706]
</p><p>33 Heart of Gold contains a rich library of shallow and deep parsing components supporting several languages, e. [sent-82, score-0.211]
</p><p>34 Nonetheless, Heart of Gold does not specifically support the construction of multilingual or multimodal workflows. [sent-85, score-0.29]
</p><p>35 In contrast to the other frameworks introduced above, UIMA (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004) provides an abstract-level mechanism that can be used to support the development of workflows that carry out transformations of the input data. [sent-86, score-0.532]
</p><p>36 This mechanism is called the Subject of Analysis or Sofa. [sent-87, score-0.084]
</p><p>37 Multiple Sofas can be linked with an input file, each of which stores different data and associated annotations. [sent-88, score-0.091]
</p><p>38 This mechanism can thus be exploited to represent alternative “views” of the input data, such as a source text and its translation. [sent-89, score-0.166]
</p><p>39 The data stored in different Sofas is not restricted to textual information; it can also correspond to other modalities, such as audio data. [sent-90, score-0.272]
</p><p>40 This makes the Sofa mechanism equally suitable for storing the output of text-to-speech workflows. [sent-91, score-0.11]
</p><p>41 Our extensions to U-Compare are thus implemented by  reading and displaying the contents of different types of Sofas. [sent-92, score-0.078]
</p><p>42 The Sofa mechanism has previously been 44  under-exploited by UIMA developers, despite its power in allowing more complex NLP workflows to be constructed. [sent-93, score-0.323]
</p><p>43 Indeed, no other existing UIMA-based platform (Kano et al. [sent-94, score-0.067]
</p><p>44 , 2008) has demonstrated the use of Sofas to construct multilingual or multimodal applications. [sent-98, score-0.222]
</p><p>45 Thus, to our knowledge, our enhancements to U-Compare constitute the first attempt to make the construction of workflows that carry out transformations of input data more readily available to UIMA users, without the need for programming skills. [sent-99, score-0.638]
</p><p>46 3  METANET4U Components in U-Compare  The two dozen national and many regional languages of Europe present linguistic barriers that can severely limit the free flow of goods, infor-  mation and services. [sent-100, score-0.046]
</p><p>47 Consisting of 60 research centres from 34 countries, META-NET has aimed to stimulate a concerted, substantial and continent-wide effort to push forward language technology research and engineering, in order to ensure equal access to information and knowledge for all European citizens. [sent-102, score-0.055]
</p><p>48 META-NET’s aims are dependent on the ready availability of LRs that can carry out NLP and text mining (TM) on a range of European languages. [sent-103, score-0.172]
</p><p>49 Such resources constitute the building blocks for constructing language technology applications that can help European citizens to gain easy access to the information they require. [sent-104, score-0.136]
</p><p>50 One of the major outcomes of META-NET has been the development of META-SHARE, an open, distributed facility for sharing and exchange of LRs in a large number of European languages. [sent-105, score-0.052]
</p><p>51 Within the context of META-NET, interoperability of LRs is clearly of utmost importance, to expedite the process of developing new NLP ap-  plications. [sent-106, score-0.147]
</p><p>52 In order to provide a concrete demonstration of the utility and power of promoting interoperability within META-SHARE, one of the sub-projects of META-NET, i. [sent-107, score-0.147]
</p><p>53 It is in this context that a set of 46 new LRs, available in META-SHARE, were wrapped as UIMA components and made available in U-Compare. [sent-110, score-0.138]
</p><p>54 Of these components, 37 operate on one or more specific languages other than English and 4 are language-independent. [sent-111, score-0.046]
</p><p>55 Table 1 shows the full set of categories of UIMA components created during the METANET4U project, together with the languages supported. [sent-112, score-0.246]
</p><p>56 Several of these new components output multiple Sofas, i. [sent-113, score-0.164]
</p><p>57 , two machine translation components, two automatic summarisation components and a text-to-speech component. [sent-115, score-0.334]
</p><p>58 It is hoped that our U-Compare extensions will help to stimulate the development of a greater number of related UIMA components, and thus promote a new level of complexity for future UIMA workflows. [sent-116, score-0.153]
</p><p>59 , Sofas, that carry different artefacts with their linked annotations. [sent-124, score-0.078]
</p><p>60 Figure 1 illustrates the different types of Sofas that are created by the three types of workflows that we will demonstrate. [sent-125, score-0.337]
</p><p>61 Firstly, for a machine translation workflow, at least 45  Figure 1: UIMA based multilingual and multimodal workflow architecture two CAS views, i. [sent-126, score-0.687]
</p><p>62 , Sofas, are created, the first corresponding to the text in the source language, and the other Sofas corresponding to the translation(s) of the source text into target language(s). [sent-128, score-0.06]
</p><p>63 , automatic summarisation, is related to the former workflow, in that the two Sofas produced by the workflow are  both textual, one containing the input text and one containing a summary of the original text. [sent-131, score-0.48]
</p><p>64 The third type of workflow is different, in that a Sofa containing audio data is used to represent the output of a multimodal workflow. [sent-132, score-0.748]
</p><p>65 Two specific extensions have been made to UCompare to handle both textual and audio Sofas. [sent-133, score-0.352]
</p><p>66 When the output of a workflow consists of multiple textual views (Sofas), the default annotation viewer is automatically split to allow multiple views of the text to be displayed and sideby-side. [sent-134, score-0.76]
</p><p>67 , to allow careful comparison of a source text and target translation in a machine translation workflow. [sent-137, score-0.128]
</p><p>68 To handle audio Sofas, we have developed a new, customised viewer that can visualise and play audio data. [sent-138, score-0.567]
</p><p>69 The visualisation consists of a graphical display of the waveform, power information and spectrogram, as well as segmentation of the audio data into regions (such as individual tokens) and transcriptions, if such information is present in the audio Sofa. [sent-139, score-0.474]
</p><p>70 The viewer makes use the open-source library Java Speech Toolkit (JSTK)5. [sent-140, score-0.111]
</p><p>71 5  Workflow applications  In order to provide a practical demonstration of the enhanced capabilities of U-Compare, we show 5http://code. [sent-141, score-0.062]
</p><p>72 com/p/jstk three different workflows that transform the input data in different ways, namely translation, automatic summarisation and speech synthesis. [sent-143, score-0.521]
</p><p>73 1 Machine translation The University of Manchester has created UIMA wrapper components corresponding to different modules of Apertium (Corb ´ı-Bellot et al. [sent-146, score-0.221]
</p><p>74 These components consist of a morphological analyser, POS tagger and translator. [sent-148, score-0.138]
</p><p>75 The three components must be run in sequence to carry out translation, although the first two components can be used in other workflows to carry out monolingual analyses. [sent-149, score-0.671]
</p><p>76 The UIMA components currently handle a subset of the 27 languages dealt with  by the complete Apertium system, corresponding to the languages of the METANET4U partners, i. [sent-150, score-0.264]
</p><p>77 aOlu lra sample workflow includes as its initial component the Language Identifier from the Romanian Academy Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence (RACAI), to automatically detect the language of the text in the input Sofa. [sent-155, score-0.483]
</p><p>78 The subsequent components in the workflow are the Apertium modules. [sent-156, score-0.503]
</p><p>79 The workflow demonstrates how heterogeneous components from different research groups can be combined into workflows to create new NLP applications. [sent-157, score-0.78]
</p><p>80 A sample output from running the workflow is shown in Figure 2. [sent-158, score-0.391]
</p><p>81 The input text was detected as English by the RACAI Language Identifier. [sent-159, score-0.082]
</p><p>82 The English text was subsequently analysed by the morphological analyser and POS Tagger, and translated to Spanish by the translator. [sent-160, score-0.07]
</p><p>83 2 Automatic summarisation Automatic summarisation for Romanian text can be carried out by creating a workflow consisting of two components developed by the Universitatea “Alexandru Ioan Cuza” din Ias ¸i (UAIC). [sent-163, score-0.827]
</p><p>84 Firstly, a segmenter (UAICSeg) splits the input text into fragments, which are in turn used as input to the summariser component (UAICSum). [sent-164, score-0.17]
</p><p>85 The length of the output summary (percentage of the whole document) is parameterised. [sent-165, score-0.059]
</p><p>86 As can be seen in 46  Figure 2: Translation of English text to Spanish  Figure 3: Summarisation of Romanian text  Figure 3, the output of this workflow is displayed using the same parallel Sofa viewer. [sent-166, score-0.525]
</p><p>87 In this case, the full text is displayed in the left-hand pane and the summary is shown in the right-hand pane. [sent-167, score-0.137]
</p><p>88 3 Speech synthesis The Universitat Polit `ecnica de Catalunya (UPC) developed a speech synthesiser component that is based around their Ogmios text-to-speech system (Bonafonte et al. [sent-169, score-0.105]
</p><p>89 4 shows how the textual Sofa information is displayed in U-Compare’s default annotation viewer, whilst the audio Sofa information is shown in the new audio visualiser mentioned above. [sent-173, score-0.594]
</p><p>90 The three different types of visual information are displayed below each other, and the segments (tokens) of the  audio file, together with their transcriptions, are displayed at the bottom of the window. [sent-174, score-0.416]
</p><p>91 A “Play” button allows either the complete file or a selected segment to be played. [sent-175, score-0.047]
</p><p>92 In 47  Figure 4: Speech Synthesis  addition, our enhancements to U-Compare mean that various types of multilingual and multimodal workflows can now be created with the minimum effort. [sent-178, score-0.646]
</p><p>93 These enhancements are intended to make U-Compare more attractive to users, and to help stimulate the development of a new generation of more complex UIMA-based NLP applications. [sent-179, score-0.226]
</p><p>94 As future work, we intend to extend the library of components that output multiple Sofas, and further extend the functionalities of U-Compare to handle other data modalities, e. [sent-180, score-0.272]

<p>Author: Rafal Rak ; Andrew Rowley ; Jacob Carter ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: Developing sophisticated NLP pipelines composed of multiple processing tools and components available through different providers may pose a challenge in terms of their interoperability. The Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) is an industry standard whose aim is to ensure such interoperability by defining common data structures and interfaces. The architecture has been gaining attention from industry and academia alike, resulting in a large volume ofUIMA-compliant processing components. In this paper, we demonstrate Argo, a Web-based workbench for the development and processing of NLP pipelines/workflows. The workbench is based upon UIMA, and thus has the potential of using many of the existing UIMA resources. We present features, and show examples, offacilitating the distributed development of components and the analysis of processing results. The latter includes annotation visualisers and editors, as well as serialisation to RDF format, which enables flexible querying in addition to data manipulation thanks to the semantic query language SPARQL. The distributed development feature allows users to seamlessly connect their tools to workflows running in Argo, and thus take advantage of both the available library of components (without the need of installing them locally) and the analytical tools.</p><p>3 0.12671794 <a title="150-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Propminer%3A_A_Workflow_for_Interactive_Information_Extraction_and_Exploration_using_Dependency_Trees.html">285 acl-2013-Propminer: A Workflow for Interactive Information Extraction and Exploration using Dependency Trees</a></p>

Despite this potential, the process of manually creating rule-based information extractors that operate on dependency trees is not intuitive for persons without an extensive NLP background. In this system demonstration, we present a tool and a workflow designed to enable initiate users to interactively explore the effect and expressivity of creating Information Extraction rules over dependency trees.

<p>Author: Valentin Tablan ; Kalina Bontcheva ; Ian Roberts ; Hamish Cunningham ; Marin Dimitrov</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents AnnoMarket, an open cloud-based platform which enables researchers to deploy, share, and use language processing components and resources, following the data-as-a-service and software-as-a-service paradigms. The focus is on multilingual text analysis resources and services, based on an opensource infrastructure and compliant with relevant NLP standards. We demonstrate how the AnnoMarket platform can be used to develop NLP applications with little or no programming, to index the results for enhanced browsing and search, and to evaluate performance. Utilising AnnoMarket is straightforward, since cloud infrastructural issues are dealt with by the platform, completely transparently to the user: load balancing, efficient data upload and storage, deployment on the virtual machines, security, and fault tolerance.</p><p>5 0.10605069 <a title="150-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-DKPro_WSD%3A_A_Generalized_UIMA-based_Framework_for_Word_Sense_Disambiguation.html">105 acl-2013-DKPro WSD: A Generalized UIMA-based Framework for Word Sense Disambiguation</a></p>
<p>Author: Tristan Miller ; Nicolai Erbs ; Hans-Peter Zorn ; Torsten Zesch ; Iryna Gurevych</p><p>Abstract: Implementations of word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithms tend to be tied to a particular test corpus format and sense inventory. This makes it difficult to test their performance on new data sets, or to compare them against past algorithms implemented for different data sets. In this paper we present DKPro WSD, a freely licensed, general-purpose framework for WSD which is both modular and extensible. DKPro WSD abstracts the WSD process in such a way that test corpora, sense inventories, and algorithms can be freely swapped. Its UIMA-based architecture makes it easy to add support for new resources and algorithms. Related tasks such as word sense induction and entity linking are also supported.</p><p>6 0.095639326 <a title="150-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-DKPro_Similarity%3A_An_Open_Source_Framework_for_Text_Similarity.html">104 acl-2013-DKPro Similarity: An Open Source Framework for Text Similarity</a></p>

<p>Author: Georgios Kontonatsios ; Paul Thompson ; Riza Theresa Batista-Navarro ; Claudiu Mihaila ; Ioannis Korkontzelos ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: U-Compare is a UIMA-based workflow construction platform for building natural language processing (NLP) applications from heterogeneous language resources (LRs), without the need for programming skills. U-Compare has been adopted within the context of the METANET Network of Excellence, and over 40 LRs that process 15 European languages have been added to the U-Compare component library. In line with METANET’s aims of increasing communication between citizens of different European countries, U-Compare has been extended to facilitate the development of a wider range of applications, including both mul- tilingual and multimodal workflows. The enhancements exploit the UIMA Subject of Analysis (Sofa) mechanism, that allows different facets of the input data to be represented. We demonstrate how our customised extensions to U-Compare allow the construction and testing of NLP applications that transform the input data in different ways, e.g., machine translation, automatic summarisation and text-to-speech.</p><p>2 0.9291479 <a title="150-lsi-2" href="./acl-2013-Development_and_Analysis_of_NLP_Pipelines_in_Argo.html">118 acl-2013-Development and Analysis of NLP Pipelines in Argo</a></p>
<p>Author: Rafal Rak ; Andrew Rowley ; Jacob Carter ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: Developing sophisticated NLP pipelines composed of multiple processing tools and components available through different providers may pose a challenge in terms of their interoperability. The Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) is an industry standard whose aim is to ensure such interoperability by defining common data structures and interfaces. The architecture has been gaining attention from industry and academia alike, resulting in a large volume ofUIMA-compliant processing components. In this paper, we demonstrate Argo, a Web-based workbench for the development and processing of NLP pipelines/workflows. The workbench is based upon UIMA, and thus has the potential of using many of the existing UIMA resources. We present features, and show examples, offacilitating the distributed development of components and the analysis of processing results. The latter includes annotation visualisers and editors, as well as serialisation to RDF format, which enables flexible querying in addition to data manipulation thanks to the semantic query language SPARQL. The distributed development feature allows users to seamlessly connect their tools to workflows running in Argo, and thus take advantage of both the available library of components (without the need of installing them locally) and the analytical tools.</p><p>3 0.81003302 <a title="150-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-AnnoMarket%3A_An_Open_Cloud_Platform_for_NLP.html">51 acl-2013-AnnoMarket: An Open Cloud Platform for NLP</a></p>

<p>Author: Pedro Fialho ; Luisa Coheur ; Sergio Curto ; Pedro Claudio ; Angela Costa ; Alberto Abad ; Hugo Meinedo ; Isabel Trancoso</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we describe a platform for embodied conversational agents with tutoring goals, which takes as input written and spoken questions and outputs answers in both forms. The platform is developed within a game environment, and currently allows speech recognition and synthesis in Portuguese, English and Spanish. In this paper we focus on its understanding component that supports in-domain interactions, and also small talk. Most indomain interactions are answered using different similarity metrics, which compare the perceived utterances with questions/sentences in the agent’s knowledge base; small-talk capabilities are mainly due to AIML, a language largely used by the chatbots’ community. In this paper we also introduce EDGAR, the butler of MONSERRATE, which was developed in the aforementioned platform, and that answers tourists’ questions about MONSERRATE.</p><p>6 0.4283905 <a title="150-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Propminer%3A_A_Workflow_for_Interactive_Information_Extraction_and_Exploration_using_Dependency_Trees.html">285 acl-2013-Propminer: A Workflow for Interactive Information Extraction and Exploration using Dependency Trees</a></p>

<p>Author: Eyal Shnarch ; Erel Segal-haLevi ; Jacob Goldberger ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents PLIS, an open source Probabilistic Lexical Inference System which combines two functionalities: (i) a tool for integrating lexical inference knowledge from diverse resources, and (ii) a framework for scoring textual inferences based on the integrated knowledge. We provide PLIS with two probabilistic implementation of this framework. PLIS is available for download and developers of text processing applications can use it as an off-the-shelf component for injecting lexical knowledge into their applications. PLIS is easily configurable, components can be extended or replaced with user generated ones to enable system customization and further research. PLIS includes an online interactive viewer, which is a powerful tool for investigating lexical inference processes. 1 Introduction and background Semantic Inference is the process by which machines perform reasoning over natural language texts. A semantic inference system is expected to be able to infer the meaning of one text from the meaning of another, identify parts of texts which convey a target meaning, and manipulate text units in order to deduce new meanings. Semantic inference is needed for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. For instance, a Question Answering (QA) system may encounter the following question and candidate answer (Example 1): Q: which explorer discovered the New World? A: Christopher Columbus revealed America. As there are no overlapping words between the two sentences, to identify that A holds an answer for Q, background world knowledge is needed to link Christopher Columbus with explorer and America with New World. Linguistic knowledge is also needed to identify that reveal and discover refer to the same concept. Knowledge is needed in order to bridge the gap between text fragments, which may be dissimilar on their surface form but share a common meaning. For the purpose of semantic inference, such knowledge can be derived from various resources (e.g. WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and others, detailed in Section 2.1) in a form which we denote as inference links (often called inference/entailment rules), each is an ordered pair of elements in which the first implies the meaning of the second. For instance, the link ship→vessel can be derived from tshtaen hypernym rkel sahtiiopn→ ovfe Wsseolr cdNanet b. Other applications can benefit from utilizing inference links to identify similarity between language expressions. In Information Retrieval, the user’s information need may be expressed in relevant documents differently than it is expressed in the query. Summarization systems should identify text snippets which convey the same meaning. Our work addresses a generic, application in- dependent, setting of lexical inference. We therefore adopt the terminology of Textual Entailment (Dagan et al., 2006), a generic paradigm for applied semantic inference which captures inference needs of many NLP applications in a common underlying task: given two textual fragments, termed hypothesis (H) and text (T), the task is to recognize whether T implies the meaning of H, denoted T→H. For instance, in a QA application, H reprTe→seHnts. Fthoer question, a innd a T Q a c aanpdpilidcaattei answer. pInthis setting, T is likely to hold an answer for the question if it entails the question. It is challenging to properly extract the needed inference knowledge from available resources, and to effectively utilize it within the inference process. The integration of resources, each has its own format, is technically complex and the quality 97 ProceedingSsof oiaf, th Beu 5lg1asrtia A,n Anuuaglu Mst 4ee-9tin 2g0 o1f3. th ?ec A20ss1o3ci Aastisoonci faotrio Cno fomrp Cuotamtipountaalti Loinnaglu Lisitnigcsu,is patigcess 97–102, Figure 1: PLIS schema - a text-hypothesis pair is processed by the Lexical Integrator which uses a set of lexical resources to extract inference chains which connect the two. The Lexical Inference component provides probability estimations for the validity of each level of the process. ofthe resulting inference links is often unknown in advance and varies considerably. For coping with this challenge we developed PLIS, a Probabilistic Lexical Inference System1 . PLIS, illustrated in Fig 1, has two main modules: the Lexical Integra- tor (Section 2) accepts a set of lexical resources and a text-hypothesis pair, and finds all the lexical inference relations between any pair of text term ti and hypothesis term hj, based on the available lexical relations found in the resources (and their combination). The Lexical Inference module (Section 3) provides validity scores for these relations. These term-level scores are used to estimate the sentence-level likelihood that the meaning of the hypothesis can be inferred from the text, thus making PLIS a complete lexical inference system. Lexical inference systems do not look into the structure of texts but rather consider them as bag ofterms (words or multi-word expressions). These systems are easy to implement, fast to run, practical across different genres and languages, while maintaining a competitive level of performance. PLIS can be used as a stand-alone efficient inference system or as the lexical component of any NLP application. PLIS is a flexible system, allowing users to choose the set of knowledge resources as well as the model by which inference 1The complete software package is available at http:// www.cs.biu.ac.il/nlp/downloads/PLIS.html and an online interactive viewer is available for examination at http://irsrv2. cs.biu.ac.il/nlp-net/PLIS.html. is done. PLIS can be easily extended with new knowledge resources and new inference models. It comes with a set of ready-to-use plug-ins for many common lexical resources (Section 2.1) as well as two implementation of the scoring framework. These implementations, described in (Shnarch et al., 2011; Shnarch et al., 2012), provide probability estimations for inference. PLIS has an interactive online viewer (Section 4) which provides a visualization of the entire inference process, and is very helpful for analysing lexical inference models and lexical resources usability. 2 Lexical integrator The input for the lexical integrator is a set of lexical resources and a pair of text T and hypothesis H. The lexical integrator extracts lexical inference links from the various lexical resources to connect each text term ti ∈ T with each hypothesis term hj ∈ H2. A lexical i∈nfTer wenicthe elianckh hinydpicoathteess a semantic∈ rHelation between two terms. It could be a directional relation (Columbus→navigator) or a bai ddiirreeccttiioonnaall one (car ←→ automobile). dSirinecceti knowledge resources vary lien) their representation methods, the lexical integrator wraps each lexical resource in a common plug-in interface which encapsulates resource’s inner representation method and exposes its knowledge as a list of inference links. The implemented plug-ins that come with PLIS are described in Section 2.1. Adding a new lexical resource and integrating it with the others only demands the implementation of the plug-in interface. As the knowledge needed to connect a pair of terms, ti and hj, may be scattered across few resources, the lexical integrator combines inference links into lexical inference chains to deduce new pieces of knowledge, such as Columbus −r −e −so −u −rc −e →2 −r −e −so −u −rc −e →1 navigator explorer. Therefore, the only assumption −t −he − l−e −x →ica elx integrator makes, regarding its input lexical resources, is that the inferential lexical relations they provide are transitive. The lexical integrator generates lexical infer- ence chains by expanding the text and hypothesis terms with inference links. These links lead to new terms (e.g. navigator in the above chain example and t0 in Fig 1) which can be further expanded, as all inference links are transitive. A transitivity 2Where iand j run from 1 to the length of the text and hypothesis respectively. 98 limit is set by the user to determine the maximal length for inference chains. The lexical integrator uses a graph-based representation for the inference chains, as illustrates in Fig 1. A node holds the lemma, part-of-speech and sense of a single term. The sense is the ordinal number of WordNet sense. Whenever we do not know the sense of a term we implement the most frequent sense heuristic.3 An edge represents an inference link and is labeled with the semantic relation of this link (e.g. cytokine→protein is larbeellaetdio wni othf tt hheis sW linokrd (Nee.gt .re clayttiookni hypernym). 2.1 Available plug-ins for lexical resources We have implemented plug-ins for the follow- ing resources: the English lexicon WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998)(based on either JWI, JWNL or extJWNL java APIs4), CatVar (Habash and Dorr, 2003), a categorial variations database, Wikipedia-based resource (Shnarch et al., 2009), which applies several extraction methods to derive inference links from the text and structure of Wikipedia, VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), a knowledge base of fine-grained semantic relations between verbs, Lin’s distributional similarity thesaurus (Lin, 1998), and DIRECT (Kotlerman et al., 2010), a directional distributional similarity thesaurus geared for lexical inference. To summarize, the lexical integrator finds all possible inference chains (of a predefined length), resulting from any combination of inference links extracted from lexical resources, which link any t, h pair of a given text-hypothesis. Developers can use this tool to save the hassle of interfacing with the different lexical knowledge resources, and spare the labor of combining their knowledge via inference chains. The lexical inference model, described next, provides a mean to decide whether a given hypothesis is inferred from a given text, based on weighing the lexical inference chains extracted by the lexical integrator. 3 Lexical inference There are many ways to implement an inference model which identifies inference relations between texts. A simple model may consider the 3This disambiguation policy was better than considering all senses of an ambiguous term in preliminary experiments. However, it is a matter of changing a variable in the configuration of PLIS to switch between these two policies. 4http://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/related-projects/ number of hypothesis terms for which inference chains, originated from text terms, were found. In PLIS, the inference model is a plug-in, similar to the lexical knowledge resources, and can be easily replaced to change the inference logic. We provide PLIS with two implemented baseline lexical inference models which are mathematically based. These are two Probabilistic Lexical Models (PLMs), HN-PLM and M-PLM which are described in (Shnarch et al., 2011; Shnarch et al., 2012) respectively. A PLM provides probability estimations for the three parts of the inference process (as shown in Fig 1): the validity probability of each inference chain (i.e. the probability for a valid inference relation between its endpoint terms) P(ti → hj), the probability of each hypothesis term to →b e i hnferred by the entire text P(T → hj) (term-level probability), eanntdir teh tee probability o hf the entire hypothesis to be inferred by the text P(T → H) (sentencelteov eble probability). HN-PLM describes a generative process by which the hypothesis is generated from the text. Its parameters are the reliability level of each of the resources it utilizes (that is, the prior probability that applying an arbitrary inference link derived from each resource corresponds to a valid inference). For learning these parameters HN-PLM applies a schema of the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977). Its performance on the recognizing textual entailment task, RTE (Bentivogli et al., 2009; Bentivogli et al., 2010), are in line with the state of the art inference systems, including complex systems which perform syntactic analysis. This model is improved by M-PLM, which deduces sentence-level probability from term-level probabilities by a Markovian process. PLIS with this model was used for a passage retrieval for a question answering task (Wang et al., 2007), and outperformed state of the art inference systems. Both PLMs model the following prominent aspects of the lexical inference phenomenon: (i) considering the different reliability levels of the input knowledge resources, (ii) reducing inference chain probability as its length increases, and (iii) increasing term-level probability as we have more inference chains which suggest that the hypothesis term is inferred by the text. Both PLMs only need sentence-level annotations from which they derive term-level inference probabilities. To summarize, the lexical inference module 99 ?(? → ?) Figure 2: PLIS interactive viewer with Example 1 demonstrates knowledge integration of multiple inference chains and resource combination (additional explanations, which are not part of the demo, are provided in orange). provides the setting for interfacing with the lexical integrator. Additionally, the module provides the framework for probabilistic inference models which estimate term-level probabilities and integrate them into a sentence-level inference decision, while implementing prominent aspects of lexical inference. The user can choose to apply another inference logic, not necessarily probabilistic, by plugging a different lexical inference model into the provided inference infrastructure. 4 The PLIS interactive system PLIS comes with an online interactive viewer5 in which the user sets the parameters of PLIS, inserts a text-hypothesis pair and gets a visualization of the entire inference process. This is a powerful tool for investigating knowledge integration and lexical inference models. Fig 2 presents a screenshot of the processing of Example 1. On the right side, the user configures the system by selecting knowledge resources, adjusting their configuration, setting the transitivity limit, and choosing the lexical inference model to be applied by PLIS. After inserting a text and a hypothesis to the appropriate text boxes, the user clicks on the infer button and PLIS generates all lexical inference chains, of length up to the transitivity limit, that connect text terms with hypothesis terms, as available from the combination of the selected input re5http://irsrv2.cs.biu.ac.il/nlp-net/PLIS.html sources. Each inference chain is presented in a line between the text and hypothesis. PLIS also displays the probability estimations for all inference levels; the probability of each chain is presented at the end of its line. For each hypothesis term, term-level probability, which weighs all inference chains found for it, is given below the dashed line. The overall sentence-level probability integrates the probabilities of all hypothesis terms and is displayed in the box at the bottom right corner. Next, we detail the inference process of Example 1, as presented in Fig 2. In this QA example, the probability of the candidate answer (set as the text) to be relevant for the given question (the hypothesis) is estimated. When utilizing only two knowledge resources (WordNet and Wikipedia), PLIS is able to recognize that explorer is inferred by Christopher Columbus and that New World is inferred by America. Each one of these pairs has two independent inference chains, numbered 1–4, as evidence for its inference relation. Both inference chains 1 and 3 include a single inference link, each derived from a different relation of the Wikipedia-based resource. The inference model assigns a higher probability for chain 1since the BeComp relation is much more reliable than the Link relation. This comparison illustrates the ability of the inference model to learn how to differ knowledge resources by their reliability. Comparing the probability assigned by the in100 ference model for inference chain 2 with the probabilities assigned for chains 1 and 3, reveals the sophisticated way by which the inference model integrates lexical knowledge. Inference chain 2 is longer than chain 1, therefore its probability is lower. However, the inference model assigns chain 2 a higher probability than chain 3, even though the latter is shorter, since the model is sensitive enough to consider the difference in reliability levels between the two highly reliable hypernym relations (from WordNet) of chain 2 and the less reliable Link relation (from Wikipedia) of chain 3. Another aspect of knowledge integration is exemplified in Fig 2 by the three circled probabilities. The inference model takes into consideration the multiple pieces of evidence for the inference of New World (inference chains 3 and 4, whose probabilities are circled). This results in a termlevel probability estimation for New World (the third circled probability) which is higher than the probabilities of each chain separately. The third term of the hypothesis, discover, remains uncovered by the text as no inference chain was found for it. Therefore, the sentence-level inference probability is very low, 37%. In order to identify that the hypothesis is indeed inferred from the text, the inference model should be provided with indications for the inference of discover. To that end, the user may increase the transitivity limit in hope that longer inference chains provide the needed information. In addition, the user can examine other knowledge resources in search for the missing inference link. In this example, it is enough to add VerbOcean to the input of PLIS to expose two inference chains which connect reveal with discover by combining an inference link from WordNet and another one from VerbOcean. With this additional information, the sentence-level probability increases to 76%. This is a typical scenario of utilizing PLIS, either via the interactive system or via the software, for analyzing the usability of the different knowledge resources and their combination. A feature of the interactive system, which is useful for lexical resources analysis, is that each term in a chain is clickable and links to another screen which presents all the terms that are inferred from it and those from which it is inferred. Additionally, the interactive system communicates with a server which runs PLIS, in a fullduplex WebSocket connection6. This mode of operation is publicly available and provides a method for utilizing PLIS, without having to install it or the lexical resources it uses. Finally, since PLIS is a lexical system it can easily be adjusted to other languages. One only needs to replace the basic lexical text processing tools and plug in knowledge resources in the target language. If PLIS is provided with bilingual resources,7 it can operate also as a cross-lingual inference system (Negri et al., 2012). For instance, the text in Fig 3 is given in English, while the hypothesis is written in Spanish (given as a list of lemma:part-of-speech). The left side of the figure depicts a cross-lingual inference process in which the only lexical knowledge resource used is a man- ually built English-Spanish dictionary. As can be seen, two Spanish terms, jugador and casa remain uncovered since the dictionary alone cannot connect them to any of the English terms in the text. As illustrated in the right side of Fig 3, PLIS enables the combination of the bilingual dictionary with monolingual resources to produce cross-lingual inference chains, such as footballer−h −y −p −er−n y −m →player− −m −a −nu − →aljugador. Such inferenc−e − c−h −a −in − →s hpalavey trh− e− capability otro. overcome monolingual language variability (the first link in this chain) as well as to provide cross-lingual translation (the second link). 5 Conclusions To utilize PLIS one should gather lexical resources, obtain sentence-level annotations and train the inference model. Annotations are available in common data sets for task such as QA, Information Retrieval (queries are hypotheses and snippets are texts) and Student Response Analysis (reference answers are the hypotheses that should be inferred by the student answers). For developers of NLP applications, PLIS offers a ready-to-use lexical knowledge integrator which can interface with many common lexical knowledge resources and constructs lexical inference chains which combine the knowledge in them. A developer who wants to overcome lexical language variability, or to incorporate background knowledge, can utilize PLIS to inject lex6We used the socket.io implementation. 7A bilingual resource holds inference links which connect terms in different languages (e.g. an English-Spanish dictionary can provide the inference link explorer→explorador). 101 Figure 3 : PLIS as a cross-lingual inference system. Left: the process with a single manual bilingual resource. Right: PLIS composes cross-lingual inference chains to increase hypothesis coverage and increase sentence-level inference probability. ical knowledge into any text understanding application. PLIS can be used as a lightweight inference system or as the lexical component of larger, more complex inference systems. Additionally, PLIS provides scores for infer- ence chains and determines the way to combine them in order to recognize sentence-level inference. PLIS comes with two probabilistic lexical inference models which achieved competitive performance levels in the tasks of recognizing textual entailment and passage retrieval for QA. All aspects of PLIS are configurable. The user can easily switch between the built-in lexical resources, inference models and even languages, or extend the system with additional lexical resources and new inference models.

<p>Author: Sean Szumlanski ; Fernando Gomez ; Valerie K. Sims</p><p>Abstract: We have elicited human quantitative judgments of semantic relatedness for 122 pairs of nouns and compiled them into a new set of relatedness norms that we call Rel-122. Judgments from individual subjects in our study exhibit high average correlation to the resulting relatedness means (r = 0.77, σ = 0.09, N = 73), although not as high as Resnik’s (1995) upper bound for expected average human correlation to similarity means (r = 0.90). This suggests that human perceptions of relatedness are less strictly constrained than perceptions of similarity and establishes a clearer expectation for what constitutes human-like performance by a computational measure of semantic relatedness. We compare the results of several WordNet-based similarity and relatedness measures to our Rel-122 norms and demonstrate the limitations of WordNet for discovering general indications of semantic relatedness. We also offer a critique of the field’s reliance upon similarity norms to evaluate relatedness measures.</p><p>5 0.94839931 <a title="150-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Turning_on_the_Turbo%3A_Fast_Third-Order_Non-Projective_Turbo_Parsers.html">362 acl-2013-Turning on the Turbo: Fast Third-Order Non-Projective Turbo Parsers</a></p>

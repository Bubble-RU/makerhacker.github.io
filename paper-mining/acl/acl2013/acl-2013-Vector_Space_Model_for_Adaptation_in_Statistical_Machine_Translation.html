</p><p>7 1 Introduction The translation models of a statistical machine translation (SMT) system are trained on parallel data. [sent-14, score-0.183]
</p><p>8 Unless there is a perfect match between the training data domain and the (test) domain in which the SMT system will be used, one can often get better performance by adapting the system to the test domain. [sent-16, score-0.178]
</p><p>9 Domain adaptation is an active topic in the natural language processing (NLP) research community. [sent-17, score-0.251]
</p><p>10 Approaches that have been tried for SMT model adaptation include mixture models, transductive learning, data selection, instance weighting, and phrase sense disambiguation, etc. [sent-19, score-0.676]
</p><p>11 Research on mixture models has considered both linear and log-linear mixtures. [sent-20, score-0.299]
</p><p>12 In transductive learning, an MT system trained on general domain data is used to translate indomain monolingual data. [sent-23, score-0.137]
</p><p>13 Ac s2s0o1ci3a Atiosnso fcoirat Cioonm foprut Caotimonpaulta Lti nognuails Lti cnsg,u piasgteics 1285–1293, typically use a rich feature set to decide on weights for the training data, at the sentence or phrase pair level. [sent-36, score-0.209]
</p><p>14 For example, a sentence from a subcorpus whose domain is far from that of the dev set would typically receive a low weight, but sentences in this subcorpus that appear to be of a general na-  ture might receive higher weights. [sent-37, score-0.586]
</p><p>15 The 2012 JHU workshop on Domain Adaptation for MT 1 proposed phrase sense disambiguation (PSD) for translation model adaptation. [sent-38, score-0.181]
</p><p>16 In this approach, the context of a phrase helps the system to find the appropriate translation. [sent-39, score-0.147]
</p><p>17 In this paper, we propose a new instance weighting approach to domain adaptation based on a vector space model (VSM). [sent-40, score-0.485]
</p><p>18 Instead of using word-based features and a computationally expensive training procedure, we capture the distributional properties of each phrase pair directly, representing it as a vector in a space which also contains a representation of the dev set. [sent-44, score-0.698]
</p><p>19 The similarity between a given phrase pair’s vector and the dev set vector becomes a feature for the decoder. [sent-45, score-0.696]
</p><p>20 It rewards phrase pairs that are in some sense closer to those found in the dev set, and punishes the rest. [sent-46, score-0.525]
</p><p>21 They all enabled VSM adaptation to beat the non-adaptive baseline, but Bhattacharyya similarity worked best, so we adopted it for the remaining experiments. [sent-48, score-0.352]
</p><p>22 The vector space used by VSM adaptation can be defined in various ways. [sent-49, score-0.357]
</p><p>23 In the experiments described below, we chose a definition that measures the contribution (to counts of a given phrase pair, or to counts of all phrase pairs in the dev set) of each training subcorpus. [sent-50, score-0.745]
</p><p>24 Thus, the variant of VSM adaptation tested here bears a superficial resemblance to domain adaptation based on mixture models for TMs, as in (Foster and Kuhn, 2007), in that both approaches rely on information about the subcorpora from which the data originate. [sent-51, score-0.975]
</p><p>25 However, a key difference is that in this paper we explicitly capture each phrase pair’s distribution across subcorpora, and compare it to the aggregated distribution of phrase pairs in the dev set. [sent-52, score-0.643]
</p><p>26 edu/workshops/archive/ws12/groups/dasmt  tion across subcorpora is captured only implicitly, by probabilities that reflect the prevalence of the pair within each subcorpus. [sent-56, score-0.283]
</p><p>27 Thus, VSM adaptation occurs at a much finer granularity than mixture model adaptation. [sent-57, score-0.457]
</p><p>28 The (dev, phrase pair) similarity would then be independent of the subcorpora. [sent-61, score-0.175]
</p><p>29 Thus, VSM adaptation is not limited to the variant of it that we tested in our experiments. [sent-63, score-0.251]
</p><p>30 2  Vector space model adaptation  Vector space models (VSMs) have been widely applied in many information retrieval and natural language processing applications. [sent-64, score-0.325]
</p><p>31 For instance, to compute the sense similarity between terms, many researchers extract features for each term from its context in a corpus, define a VSM and then apply similarity functions (Hindle, 1990; Lund and Burgess, 1996; Lin, 1998; Turney, 2001). [sent-65, score-0.159]
</p><p>32 For instance, the Chinese-English training data are made up of 14 subcorpora (see section 3 below). [sent-67, score-0.252]
</p><p>33 (2)  To avoid a bias towards longer corpora, we normalize the raw joint count ci (f, e) in the corpus si by dividing by the maximum raw count of any  12p86hrase pair extracted in the corpus si. [sent-78, score-0.141]
</p><p>34 ,  (4)  where df(f, e) is the number of subcorpora that (f, e) appears in, and λ is an empirically determined smoothing term. [sent-83, score-0.254]
</p><p>35 For the in-domain dev set, we first run word alignment and phrases extracting in the usual way for the dev set, then sum the distribution of each phrase pair (fj , ek) extracted from the dev data across subcorpora to represent its domain information. [sent-84, score-1.595]
</p><p>36 , wC(dev) >,  (5)  = X X cdev(fj,ek)wi(fj,ek)  (6)  w1  where Xj=J  wi(dev)  Xj=0  kX=K  Xk=0  J, K are the total numbers of source/target phrases extracted from the dev data respectively. [sent-88, score-0.383]
</p><p>37 cdev (fj , ek) is the joint count of phrase pair fj , ek found in the dev set. [sent-89, score-0.705]
</p><p>38 The vector can also be built with other features of the phrase pair. [sent-90, score-0.187]
</p><p>39 For instance, we could replace the raw joint count ci(f, e) in Equation 3 with the raw marginal count of phrase pairs (f, e). [sent-91, score-0.278]
</p><p>40 Therefore, even within the variant of VSM adaptation we focus on in this paper, where the definition of the vector space is based on the existence of subcorpora, one could utilize other definitions of the vectors ofthe similarity function than those we utilized in our experiments. [sent-92, score-0.414]
</p><p>41 1 Vector similarity functions  VSM uses the similarity score between the vector representing the in-domain dev set and the vector representing each phrase pair as a decoder feature. [sent-94, score-0.859]
</p><p>42 The Bhattacharyya coefficient (BC) is defined as follows: Xi=C  BC(dev;f,e) =  X ppi(dev) · pi(f,e)  (9)  Xi=0  The other two similarity functions we also tested are JSD and cosine (Cos). [sent-105, score-0.132]
</p><p>43 Table 1 summarizes information about the training, development and test sets; we show the sizes of the training subcorpora in number of words as a percentage of all training data. [sent-113, score-0.282]
</p><p>44 Each corpus was word-aligned using IBM2, HMM, and IBM4 models, and the phrase table was the union of phrase pairs extracted from these separate alignments, with a length limit of 7. [sent-129, score-0.26]
</p><p>45 cfm  12t8o8 two widely used TM domain adaptation ap-  proaches. [sent-140, score-0.296]
</p><p>46 One is the log-linear combination of TMs trained on each subcorpus (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007), with weights of each model tuned under minimal error rate training using MIRA. [sent-141, score-0.133]
</p><p>47 The other is a linear combination of TMs trained on each subcorpus, with the weights of each model learned with an EM algorithm to maximize the likelihood of joint empirical phrase pair counts for in-domain dev data. [sent-142, score-0.691]
</p><p>48 1)  are determined by the performance on the dev set of the Arabic-to-English system. [sent-145, score-0.383]
</p><p>49 For both Arabic-to-English and Chinese-to-English experiment, these values obtained on Arabic dev were used to obtain the results below: λ was set to 8, and α was set to 0. [sent-146, score-0.383]
</p><p>50 The Bhattacharyya coefficient is explicitly designed to measure the overlap between the probability distributions of two statistical samples or populations, which is precisely what we are trying to do here: we are trying to reward phrase pairs whose distribution is similar to that of the dev set. [sent-159, score-0.583]
</p><p>51 In the next set of experiments, we compared VSM adaptation using the BC similarity function with the baseline which concatenates all training data and with log-linear and linear TM mixtures  JsbCBySaOsDteSlimne3 C123h. [sent-161, score-0.477]
</p><p>52 Table 4 shows that log-linear combination performs worse than the baseline: the tuning algorithm failed to optimize the log-linear combination even on dev set. [sent-171, score-0.383]
</p><p>53 For Chinese, the BLEU score of the dev set on the baseline system is 27. [sent-172, score-0.458]
</p><p>54 0; for Arabic, the BLEU score of the dev set on the baseline system is 46. [sent-174, score-0.458]
</p><p>55 Linear mixture was significantly better than the baseline at the p < 0. [sent-178, score-0.252]
</p><p>56 Since our approach, VSM, performed better than the linear mixture for both pairs, it is of course also significantly better than the baseline at the p < 0. [sent-180, score-0.345]
</p><p>57 This raises the question: is VSM performance significantly better than that of a linear mixture of TMs? [sent-182, score-0.299]
</p><p>58 The answer (not shown in the table) is that for Arabic to English, VSM performance is better than linear mixture at the p < 0. [sent-183, score-0.299]
</p><p>59 For Chinese to English, the argument for the superiority of VSM over linear mixture is less convincing: there is significance at the p < 0. [sent-185, score-0.325]
</p><p>60 At any rate, these results establish that VSM adaptation is clearly superior to linear mixture TM adaptation, for one of the two language pairs. [sent-187, score-0.586]
</p><p>61 In Table 4, the VSM results are based on the 1289  Table 5: Results for adaptation based on joint or maginal counts. [sent-188, score-0.251]
</p><p>62 In Table 5, we first show the results based on source and target marginal counts, then the results of using feature sets drawn from three decoder VSM features: a joint count feature, a source marginal count feature, and a target marginal count feature. [sent-191, score-0.288]
</p><p>63 When we compared two sets of results in Table 4, the joint count version of VSM and linear mixture of TMs, we found that for Arabic to English, VSM performance is better than linear mixture at the p < 0. [sent-198, score-0.638]
</p><p>64 01 level; the Chinese to English significance test was inconclusive (VSM found to be superior to linear mixture at p < 0. [sent-199, score-0.361]
</p><p>65 For Chinese, 3-feature VSM is now superior to linear mixture at p < 0. [sent-205, score-0.335]
</p><p>66 01 on NIST06 test set, but 3-feature VSM still doesn’t have a statistically significant edge over linear mixture on  NIST08 test set. [sent-206, score-0.324]
</p><p>67 A fair summary would be that 3feature VSM adaptation is decisively superior to linear mixture adaptation for Arabic to English, tation for Chinese to English. [sent-207, score-0.837]
</p><p>68 Our last set of experiments examined the question: when added to a system that already has some form of linear mixture model adaptation, does VSM improve performance? [sent-208, score-0.328]
</p><p>69 In (Foster and Kuhn, 2007), two kinds of linear mixture were described: linear mixture of language models (LMs), and linear mixture of translation models (TMs). [sent-209, score-0.96]
</p><p>70 Some of the results reported above involved linear TM mixtures, but none of them involved linear LM mixtures. [sent-210, score-0.186]

</p><p>72 * and ** denote significant gains over the row no vsm at p < 0. [sent-212, score-0.674]
</p><p>73 For instance, with an initial Chinese system that employs linear mixture LM adaptation (lin-lm) and has a BLEU of 32. [sent-216, score-0.579]
</p><p>74 1, adding 1-feature VSM adaptation (+vsm, joint)  improves performance to 33. [sent-217, score-0.251]
</p><p>75 For Arabic, including either form of VSM adaptation always improves performance with significance at p < 0. [sent-223, score-0.277]
</p><p>76 01, even over a system including both linear TM and linear LM adaptation. [sent-224, score-0.215]
</p><p>77 For Chinese, adding VSM still always yields an improvement, but the improvement is not significant if linear TM adaptation is already in the system. [sent-225, score-0.369]
</p><p>78 These results show that combining VSM adaptation and either or both kinds of linear mixture adaptation never hurts performance, and often improves it by a significant amount. [sent-226, score-0.826]
</p><p>79 4  Informal Data Analysis  To get an intuition for how VSM adaptation improves BLEU scores, we compared outputs from the baseline and VSM-adapted system (“vsm, joint” in Table 5) on the Chinese test data. [sent-228, score-0.326]
</p><p>80 Thus, we ignored differences in the two translations that might have been due to the secondary and highly competitive with linear mixture adap-  Table  6:  12e90ffects of VSM adaptation (such as a different tar-  CAhraibnecs+ vo s vm sm, j3oifenat. [sent-230, score-0.55]

</p><p>83 get phrase being preferred by the language model in the VSM-adapted system from the one preferred in the baseline system because of a Bhattacharyyamediated change in the phrase preceding it). [sent-240, score-0.34]
</p><p>84 An interesting pattern soon emerged: the VSMadapted system seems to be better than the baseline at choosing among synonyms in a way that is appropriate to the genre or style of a text. [sent-241, score-0.197]
</p><p>85 For instance, where the text to be translated is from an informal genre such as weblog, the VSM-adapted  system will often pick an informal word where the baseline picks a formal word with the same or similar meaning, and vice versa where the text to be translated is from a more formal genre. [sent-242, score-0.259]
</p><p>86 In the first example, the first two lines show that VSM finds that the Chinese-English phrase pair (殴打, assaulted) has a Bhattacharyya (BC) similarity of 0. [sent-245, score-0.236]
</p><p>87 556163 to the dev set, while the phrase pair (殴 打, beat) has a BC similarity of 0. [sent-246, score-0.619]
</p><p>88 Note that the result of VSM adaptation is that the rather formal word “assaulted” is replaced by its informal near-synonym “beat” in the translation of an informal weblog text. [sent-250, score-0.481]
</p><p>89 However, it looks as though the VSM-adapted system has learned from the dev that among synonyms, those more characteristic of news stories than of legal texts should be chosen: it therefore picks “arrest” over its synonym “apprehend”. [sent-252, score-0.436]
</p><p>90 4  Conclusions and future work  This paper proposed a new approach to domain adaptation in statistical machine translation, based on vector space models (VSMs). [sent-256, score-0.43]
</p><p>91 This approach measures the similarity between a vector representing a particular phrase pair in the phrase table and a vector representing the dev set, yielding a feature associated with that phrase pair that will be used by the decoder. [sent-257, score-1.054]
</p><p>92 Furthermore, VSM adaptation can be exploited in a number of different ways, which we have only begun to explore. [sent-275, score-0.251]
</p><p>93 In our experiments, we based the vector space on subcorpora defined by the nature of the training data. [sent-276, score-0.358]

<p>Author: Boxing Chen ; Roland Kuhn ; George Foster</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to domain adaptation in statistical machine translation (SMT) based on a vector space model (VSM). The general idea is first to create a vector profile for the in-domain development (“dev”) set. This profile might, for instance, be a vector with a dimensionality equal to the number of training subcorpora; each entry in the vector reflects the contribution of a particular subcorpus to all the phrase pairs that can be extracted from the dev set. Then, for each phrase pair extracted from the training data, we create a vector with features defined in the same way, and calculate its similarity score with the vector representing the dev set. Thus, we obtain a de- coding feature whose value represents the phrase pair’s closeness to the dev. This is a simple, computationally cheap form of instance weighting for phrase pairs. Experiments on large scale NIST evaluation data show improvements over strong baselines: +1.8 BLEU on Arabic to English and +1.4 BLEU on Chinese to English over a non-adapted baseline, and significant improvements in most circumstances over baselines with linear mixture model adaptation. An informal analysis suggests that VSM adaptation may help in making a good choice among words with the same meaning, on the basis of style and genre.</p><p>2 0.21285853 <a title="383-tfidf-2" href="./acl-2013-A_Multi-Domain_Translation_Model_Framework_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">11 acl-2013-A Multi-Domain Translation Model Framework for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Rico Sennrich ; Holger Schwenk ; Walid Aransa</p><p>Abstract: While domain adaptation techniques for SMT have proven to be effective at improving translation quality, their practicality for a multi-domain environment is often limited because of the computational and human costs of developing and maintaining multiple systems adapted to different domains. We present an architecture that delays the computation of translation model features until decoding, allowing for the application of mixture-modeling techniques at decoding time. We also de- scribe a method for unsupervised adaptation with development and test data from multiple domains. Experimental results on two language pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of both our translation model architecture and automatic clustering, with gains of up to 1BLEU over unadapted systems and single-domain adaptation.</p><p>3 0.15211621 <a title="383-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Recognizing_Identical_Events_with_Graph_Kernels.html">296 acl-2013-Recognizing Identical Events with Graph Kernels</a></p>
<p>Author: Goran Glavas ; Jan Snajder</p><p>Abstract: Identifying news stories that discuss the same real-world events is important for news tracking and retrieval. Most existing approaches rely on the traditional vector space model. We propose an approach for recognizing identical real-world events based on a structured, event-oriented document representation. We structure documents as graphs of event mentions and use graph kernels to measure the similarity between document pairs. Our experiments indicate that the proposed graph-based approach can outperform the traditional vector space model, and is especially suitable for distinguishing between topically similar, yet non-identical events.</p><p>4 0.15052074 <a title="383-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Learning_a_Phrase-based_Translation_Model_from_Monolingual_Data_with_Application_to_Domain_Adaptation.html">223 acl-2013-Learning a Phrase-based Translation Model from Monolingual Data with Application to Domain Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiajun Zhang ; Chengqing Zong</p><p>Abstract: Currently, almost all of the statistical machine translation (SMT) models are trained with the parallel corpora in some specific domains. However, when it comes to a language pair or a different domain without any bilingual resources, the traditional SMT loses its power. Recently, some research works study the unsupervised SMT for inducing a simple word-based translation model from the monolingual corpora. It successfully bypasses the constraint of bitext for SMT and obtains a relatively promising result. In this paper, we take a step forward and propose a simple but effective method to induce a phrase-based model from the monolingual corpora given an automatically-induced translation lexicon or a manually-edited translation dictionary. We apply our method for the domain adaptation task and the extensive experiments show that our proposed method can substantially improve the translation quality. 1</p><p>5 0.13457392 <a title="383-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Hierarchical_Phrase_Table_Combination_for_Machine_Translation.html">181 acl-2013-Hierarchical Phrase Table Combination for Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Boxing Chen ; Roland Kuhn ; George Foster</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to domain adaptation in statistical machine translation (SMT) based on a vector space model (VSM). The general idea is first to create a vector profile for the in-domain development (“dev”) set. This profile might, for instance, be a vector with a dimensionality equal to the number of training subcorpora; each entry in the vector reflects the contribution of a particular subcorpus to all the phrase pairs that can be extracted from the dev set. Then, for each phrase pair extracted from the training data, we create a vector with features defined in the same way, and calculate its similarity score with the vector representing the dev set. Thus, we obtain a de- coding feature whose value represents the phrase pair’s closeness to the dev. This is a simple, computationally cheap form of instance weighting for phrase pairs. Experiments on large scale NIST evaluation data show improvements over strong baselines: +1.8 BLEU on Arabic to English and +1.4 BLEU on Chinese to English over a non-adapted baseline, and significant improvements in most circumstances over baselines with linear mixture model adaptation. An informal analysis suggests that VSM adaptation may help in making a good choice among words with the same meaning, on the basis of style and genre.</p><p>2 0.80939788 <a title="383-lsi-2" href="./acl-2013-A_Multi-Domain_Translation_Model_Framework_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">11 acl-2013-A Multi-Domain Translation Model Framework for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Majid Razmara ; Anoop Sarkar</p><p>Abstract: We propose the use of stacking, an ensemble learning technique, to the statistical machine translation (SMT) models. A diverse ensemble of weak learners is created using the same SMT engine (a hierarchical phrase-based system) by manipulating the training data and a strong model is created by combining the weak models on-the-fly. Experimental results on two language pairs and three different sizes of training data show significant improvements of up to 4 BLEU points over a conventionally trained SMT model.</p><p>5 0.67372477 <a title="383-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Integrating_Translation_Memory_into_Phrase-Based_Machine_Translation_during_Decoding.html">201 acl-2013-Integrating Translation Memory into Phrase-Based Machine Translation during Decoding</a></p>
<p>Author: Kun Wang ; Chengqing Zong ; Keh-Yih Su</p><p>Abstract: Since statistical machine translation (SMT) and translation memory (TM) complement each other in matched and unmatched regions, integrated models are proposed in this paper to incorporate TM information into phrase-based SMT. Unlike previous multi-stage pipeline approaches, which directly merge TM result into the final output, the proposed models refer to the corresponding TM information associated with each phrase at SMT decoding. On a Chinese–English TM database, our experiments show that the proposed integrated Model-III is significantly better than either the SMT or the TM systems when the fuzzy match score is above 0.4. Furthermore, integrated Model-III achieves overall 3.48 BLEU points improvement and 2.62 TER points reduction in comparison with the pure SMT system.

<p>Author: Kevin Duh ; Graham Neubig ; Katsuhito Sudoh ; Hajime Tsukada</p><p>Abstract: Data selection is an effective approach to domain adaptation in statistical machine translation. The idea is to use language models trained on small in-domain text to select similar sentences from large general-domain corpora, which are then incorporated into the training data. Substantial gains have been demonstrated in previous works, which employ standard ngram language models. Here, we explore the use of neural language models for data selection. We hypothesize that the continuous vector representation of words in neural language models makes them more effective than n-grams for modeling un- known word contexts, which are prevalent in general-domain text. In a comprehensive evaluation of 4 language pairs (English to German, French, Russian, Spanish), we found that neural language models are indeed viable tools for data selection: while the improvements are varied (i.e. 0.1 to 1.7 gains in BLEU), they are fast to train on small in-domain data and can sometimes substantially outperform conventional n-grams.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.85421097 <a title="383-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Vector_Space_Model_for_Adaptation_in_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">383 acl-2013-Vector Space Model for Adaptation in Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

There has been much work on semantic frame parsers, but less that applies them to general NLP problems. We address a task to predict change in stock price from financial news. Semantic frames help to generalize from specific sentences to scenarios, and to detect the (positive or negative) roles of specific companies. We introduce a novel tree representation, and use it to train predictive models with tree kernels using support vector machines. Our experiments test multiple text representations on two binary classification tasks, change of price and polarity. Experiments show that features derived from semantic frame parsing have significantly better performance across years on the polarity task.</p><p>4 0.83317864 <a title="383-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Integrating_Translation_Memory_into_Phrase-Based_Machine_Translation_during_Decoding.html">201 acl-2013-Integrating Translation Memory into Phrase-Based Machine Translation during Decoding</a></p>

Source phrases that are unlikely to have aligned target constituents are identified using sequence labellers learned from the parallel corpus, and speed-up is obtained by pruning corresponding chart cells.

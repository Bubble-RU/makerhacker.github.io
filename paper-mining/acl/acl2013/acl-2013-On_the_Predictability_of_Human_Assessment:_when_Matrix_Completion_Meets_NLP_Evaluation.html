<p>Author: Daniel Beck ; Lucia Specia ; Trevor Cohn</p><p>Abstract: Quality estimation models provide feedback on the quality of machine translated texts. They are usually trained on humanannotated datasets, which are very costly due to its task-specific nature. We investigate active learning techniques to reduce the size of these datasets and thus annotation effort. Experiments on a number of datasets show that with as little as 25% of the training instances it is possible to obtain similar or superior performance compared to that of the complete datasets. In other words, our active learning query strategies can not only reduce annotation effort but can also result in better quality predictors. ,t .</p><p>3 0.17687109 <a title="263-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-English-to-Russian_MT_evaluation_campaign.html">135 acl-2013-English-to-Russian MT evaluation campaign</a></p>

<p>Author: Guangyou Zhou ; Fang Liu ; Yang Liu ; Shizhu He ; Jun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: Community question answering (CQA) has become an increasingly popular research topic. In this paper, we focus on the problem of question retrieval. Question retrieval in CQA can automatically find the most relevant and recent questions that have been solved by other users. However, the word ambiguity and word mismatch problems bring about new challenges for question retrieval in CQA. State-of-the-art approaches address these issues by implicitly expanding the queried questions with additional words or phrases using monolingual translation models. While useful, the effectiveness of these models is highly dependent on the availability of quality parallel monolingual corpora (e.g., question-answer pairs) in the absence of which they are troubled by noise issue. In this work, we propose an alternative way to address the word ambiguity and word mismatch problems by taking advantage of potentially rich semantic information drawn from other languages. Our proposed method employs statistical machine translation to improve question retrieval and enriches the question representation with the translated words from other languages via matrix factorization. Experiments conducted on a real CQA data show that our proposed approach is promising.</p><p>5 0.1708768 <a title="263-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Models_of_Translation_Competitions.html">250 acl-2013-Models of Translation Competitions</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark Hopkins ; Jonathan May</p><p>Abstract: What do we want to learn from a translation competition and how do we learn it with confidence? We argue that a disproportionate focus on ranking competition participants has led to lots of different rankings, but little insight about which rankings we should trust. In response, we provide the first framework that allows an empirical comparison of different analyses of competition results. We then use this framework to compare several analytical models on data from the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT). 1 The WMT Translation Competition Every year, the Workshop on Machine Transla- , tion (WMT) conducts a competition between machine translation systems. The WMT organizers invite research groups to submit translation systems in eight different tracks: Czech to/from English, French to/from English, German to/from English, and Spanish to/from English. For each track, the organizers also assemble a panel of judges, typically machine translation specialists.1 The role of a judge is to repeatedly rank five different translations of the same source text. Ties are permitted. In Table 1, we show an example2 where a judge (we’ll call him “jdoe”) has ranked five translations of the French sentence “Il ne va pas.” Each such elicitation encodes ten pairwise comparisons, as shown in Table 2. For each competition track, WMT typically elicits between 5000 and 20000 comparisons. Once the elicitation process is complete, WMT faces a large database of comparisons and a question that must be answered: whose system is the best? 1Although in recent competitions, some ofthejudging has also been crowdsourced (Callison-Burch et al., 2010). 2The example does not use actual system output. jmay} @ sdl . com Table21r:a(451tniekW)MsTuycbejskhmtdeiunltmics“Hp r“eHt derfa eongris densolacstneogi tnsog.”bto. y”asking judges to simultaneously rank five translations, with ties permitted. In this (fictional) example, the source sentence is the French “Il ne va pas.” ble 1. A preference of 0 means neither translation was preferred. Otherwise the preference specifies the preferred system. 2 A Ranking Problem For several years, WMT used the following heuristic for ranking the translation systems: ORIGWMT(s) =win(sw)in +(s ti)e( +s t)ie +(s lo)ss(s) For system s, win (s) is the number of pairwise comparisons in which s was preferred, loss(s) is the number of comparisons in which s was dispreferred, and tie(s) is the number of comparisons in which s participated but neither system was preferred. Recently, (Bojar et al., 2011) questioned the adequacy of this heuristic through the following ar1416 Proce dingsS o f ita h,e B 5u1lgsta Arinan,u Aaulg Musete 4ti-n9g 2 o0f1 t3h.e ? Ac s2s0o1ci3a Atiosnso fcoirat Cio nm foprut Caotimonpaulta Lti nognuails Lti cnsg,u piasgteics 1416–1424, gument. Consider a competition with systems A and B. Suppose that the systems are different but equally good, such that one third of the time A is judged better than B, one third of the time B is judged better than A, and one third of the time they are judged to be equal. The expected values of ORIGWMT(A) and ORIGWMT(B) are both 2/3, so the heuristic accurately judges the systems to be equivalently good. Suppose however that we had duplicated B and had submitted it to the competition a second time as system C. Since B and C produce identical translations, they should always tie with one another. The expected value of ORIGWMT(A) would not change, but the expected value of ORIGWMT(B) would increase to 5/6, buoyed by its ties with system C. This vulnerability prompted (Bojar et al., 2011) to offer the following revision: BOJAR(s) =win(sw)in +(s lo)ss(s) The following year, it was BOJAR’s turn to be criticized, this time by (Lopez, 2012): Superficially, this appears to be an improvement....couldn’t a system still be penalized simply by being compared to [good systems] more frequently than its competitors? On the other hand, couldn’t a system be rewarded simply by being compared against a bad system more frequently than its competitors? Lopez’s concern, while reasonable, is less obviously damning than (Bojar et al., 2011)’s criticism of ORIGWMT. It depends on whether the collected set of comparisons is small enough or biased enough to make the variance in competition significant. While this hypothesis is plausible, Lopez makes no attempt to verify it. Instead, he offers a ranking heuristic of his own, based on a Minimum Feedback Arc solver. The proliferation of ranking heuristics continued from there. The WMT 2012 organizers (Callison-Burch et al., 2012) took Lopez’s ranking scheme and provided a variant called Most Proba- ble Ranking. Then, noting some potential pitfalls with that, they created two more, called Monte Carlo Playoffs and Expected Wins. While one could raise philosophical objections about each of these, where would it end? Ultimately, the WMT 2012 findings presented five different rankings for the English-German competition track, with no guidance about which ranking we should pay attention to. How can we know whether one ranking is better than other? Or is this even the right question to ask? 3 A Problem with Rankings Suppose four systems participate in a translation competition. Three of these systems are extremely close in quality. We’ll call these close1, close2, and close3. Nevertheless, close1 is very slightly better3 than close2, and close2 is very slightly better than close3. The fourth system, called terrific, is a really terrific system that far exceeds the other three. Now which is the better ranking? terrific, close3, close1, close2 close1, terrific, close2, close3 (1) (2) Spearman’s rho4 would favor the second ranking, since it is a less disruptive permutation of the gold ranking. But intuition favors the first. While its mistakes are minor, the second ranking makes the hard-to-forgive mistake of placing close1 ahead of the terrific system. The problem is not with Spearman’s rho. The problem is the disconnnect between the knowledge that we want a ranking to reflect and the knowledge that a ranking actually contains. Without this additional knowledge, we cannot determine whether one ranking is better than another, even if we know the gold ranking. We need to determine what information they lack, and define more rigorously what we hope to learn from a translation competition. 4 From Rankings to Relative Ability Ostensibly the purpose of a translation competition is to determine the relative ability of a set of translation systems. Let S be the space of all otrfan trsalnatsiloanti systems. Hereafter, we hwei lslp raecfeer o tfo Sll as nthslea space ostfe smtus.de Hntesr. a Wftee c,h woeos wei ltlh ires teerrm to t So evoke the metaphor of a translation competition as a standardized test, which shares the same goal: to assess the relative abilities of a set of participants. But what exactly do we mean by “ability”? Before formally defining this term, first recognize that it means little without context, namely: 3What does “better” mean? We’ll return to this question. 4Or Pearson’s correlation coefficient. 1417 1. What kind of source text do we want the systems to translate well? Say system A is great at translating travel-related documents, but terrible at translating newswire. Meanwhile, system B is pretty good at both. The question “which system is better?” requires us to state how much we care about travel versus newswire documents otherwise the question is underspecified. – 2. Who are we trying to impress? While it’s tempting to think that translation quality is a universal notion, the 50-60% interannotator agreement in WMT evaluations (CallisonBurch et al., 2012) suggests otherwise. It’s also easy to imagine reasons why one group of judges might have different priorities than another. Think a Fortune 500 company versus web forum users. Lawyers versus laymen. Non-native versus native speakers. Posteditors versus Google Translate users. Different groups have different uses for translation, and therefore different definitions of what “better” means. With this in mind, let’s define some additional elements of a translation competition. Let X be the space osf o afll a possible segments toitfi source text, J h bee tshpea space lolf p paolls possible judges, fa snodu rΠc = {0, 1, 2} bthee tshpea space ol fp pairwise d pgreesf,e arenndc Πes=. 5 W0,e1 assume all spaces are countable. Unless stated otherwise, variables s1 and s2 represent students from S, variable x represents a segment from X, variaSb,l ev j represents a judge af sroemgm J, ta fnrod mva Xria,b vlea π represents a preference fero fmro mΠ. J Moreover, adbelfein πe the negation ˆπ of preference π such that ˆπ = 2 (if π = 1), ˆπ = 1(if π = 2), and ˆπ = 0 (if π = 0). Now assume a joint distribution P(s1, s2, x, j,π) specifying the probability that we ask judge j to evaluate students s1 and s2’s respective translations of source text x, and that judge j’s preference is π. We will further assume that the choice of student pair, source text, and judge are marginally independent of one another. In other words: P(s1, s2, x, j,π) = P(π|s1, s2, x,j) · P(x|s1, s2, j) = ·P(j|s1,s2) · P(s1,s2) P(π|s1, s2, x, j) · P(x) · P(j) · P(s1, s2) = PX(x) · PJ(j) · P(s1, s2) · P(π|s1, s2, x,j) X(x) 5As a reminder, 0 indicates no preference. It will be useful to reserve notation PX and PJ for the marginal distributions over source text and judges. We can marginalize over the source segments and judges to obtain a useful quantity: P(π|s1, s2) = X XPX(x) · PJ(j) · P(π|s1,s2,x,j) Xx∈X Xj∈J We refer to this as the hPX, PJi-relative ability of Wstued reenftesr s1 hanisd a s2. By using d-rifeflearteinvet marginal distributions PX, we can specify what kinds of source text interest us (for instance, PX could focus most of its probability mass on German tweets). Similarly, by using different marginal distributions PJ, we can specify what judges we want to impress (for instance, PJ could focus all of its mass on one important corporate customer or evenly among all fluent bilingual speakers of a language pair). With this machinery, we can express the purpose of a translation competition more clearly: to estimate the hPX, PJi-relative ability of a set toof eststuidmenattes. Ien h Pthe case orefl WMT, PJ presumably6 defines a space of competent source-totarget bilingual speakers, while PX defines a space of newswire documents. We’ll refer to an estimate of P(π|s1 , s2) as a preference rm toode anl. Istni moattheer o words, a prefer- ence model is a distribution Q(π|s1 , s2). Given a cseet moofd pairwise comparisons (e.g., Table 2), the challenge is to estimate a preference model Q(π|s1 , s2) such that Q is “close” to P. For measuring distributional proximity, a natural choice is KL-divergence (Kullback and Leibler, 195 1), but we cannot use it here because P is unknown. Fortunately, ifwe have i.i.d. data drawn from P, then we can do the next best thing and compute the perplexity of preference model Q on this heldout test data. Let D be a sequence of triples hs1, s2, πi wteshter dea tah.e L preferences π are i o.if.d t.r samples fr,oπmi P(π|s1 , s2). The perplexity of preference model Q on stest data D is: perplexity(Q|D) = 2−Phs1,s2,πi∈D |D1|log2Q(π|s1,s2) How do we obtain such a test set from competition data? Recall that a WMT competition produces pairwise comparisons like those in Table 2. 6One could argue that it specifies a space of machine translation specialists, but likely these individuals are thought to be a representative sample of a broader community. 1418 Let C be the set of comparisons hs1, s2, x, j,πi Lobettai Cne bde f trhoem s a t orfan csolamtipoanr competition. ,Cjo,mπipetition data C is not necessarily7 sampled i.i.d. fpreotmiti P(s1, s2, x, j,π) n beeccaeusssaer we may intentionally8 bias data collection towards certain students, judges or source text. Also, because WMT elicits its data in batches (see Table 1), every segment x of source text appears in at least ten comparisons. To create an appropriately-sized test set that closely resembles i.i.d. data, we isolate the subset C0 of comparisons whose source text appears isne ta tC most k comparisons, where k is the smallest positive integer such that |C0| >= 2000. We then cporesaitteiv teh ien tteegste sre stu uDch hfr thomat |CC0: D = {hs1, s2, πi|hs1, s2, x,j, πi ∈ C0} We reserve the remaining comparisons for training preference models. Table 3 shows the resulting dataset sizes for each competition track. Unlike with raw rankings, the claim that one preference model is better than another has testable implications. Given two competing models, we can train them on the same comparisons, and compare their perplexities on the test set. This gives us a quantitative9 answer to the question of which is the better model. We can then publish a system ranking based on the most trustworthy preference model. 5 Baselines Let’s begin then, and create some simple preference models to serve as baselines. 5.1 Uniform The simplest preference model is a uniform distribution over preferences, for any choice of students s1 s2: , Q(π|s1,s2) =31 ∀π ∈ Π This will be our only model that does not require training data, and its perplexity on any test set will be 3 (i.e. equal to number of possible preferences). 5.2 Adjusted Uniform Now suppose we have a set C of comparisons aNvoawilab sluep pfoors training.

C(s1 , s2) denote the subset comparing students s1 aCn(ds s2. Perhaps the simplest thing we can do with the training data is to estimate the probability of ties (i.e. preference 0). We can then distribute the remaining probability mass uniformly among the other two preferences: 6SQim(pπ|lse1B,sa2y)e=sia   n1M−o2d|C Ce0| lsiofthπer=wi0se 6.1 Independent Pairs Another simple model is the direct estimation of each relative ability P(π|s1 , s2) independently. In oetahcher words, f aobri eliatych P pair sof students s1 and s2, we estimate a separate preference distribution. The maximum likelihood estimate of each distribution would be: Q(π|s1,s2) =|C|Cπ((ss11,,ss22))|| ++ | CC πˆ(s(2s,2s,1s)1|)| However the maximum likelihood estimate would test poorly, since any zero probability estimates for test set preferences would result in infinite perplexity. To make this model practical, we assume a symmetric Dirichlet prior with strength α for each preference distribution. This gives us the following Bayesian estimate: Q(π|s1,s2) =α3α + + |C |πC((ss11,,ss22))|| + + | |CC πˆ((ss22,,ss11))|| We call this the Independent model. Pairs preference 6.2 Independent Students The Independent Pairs model makes a strong inde- pendence assumption. It assumes that even if we know that student A is much better than student B, and that student B is much better than student C, we can infer nothing about how student A will fare versus student C. Instead of directly estimating the relative ability P(π|s1 , s2) of students s1 and s2, we ctoivueld a binilsittyead P Ptry tso estimate the universal ability P(π|s1) Ps2∈S P(π|s1, s2) · P(s2|s1) of ietaych P i(nπd|sividual sPtud∈enSt s1 πa|nsd the)n try tso reconstruct the relativeP abilities from these estimates.

QA( dπo|swnside of this approach is that there is no principled way to reconstruct a preference model from the universal ability estimates. We experiment with three ad-hoc reconstructions. The asymmetric reconstruction simply ignores any information we have about student s2: Q(π|s1, s2) = Q(π|s1) The arithmetic and geometric reconstructions compute an arithmetic/geometric average of the two universal abilities: Q(π|s1,s2) Q(π|s1, s2) = Q(π|s1) +2 Q( πˆ|s2) = [Q(π|s1) ∗ Q(ˆ π|s2)]21 We respectively call these the (Asymmetric/Arithmetic/Geometric) Independent Students preference models.

Presuming the students are paired uniformly at random, this issue diminishes as more comparisons are elicited. But preference elicitation is expensive, so it makes sense to assess the relative ability of the students with as few elicitations as possible. Still, WMT 2012’s decision to eliminate references entirely is a bit of a draconian measure, a treatment of the symptom rather than the (perceived) disease. If our models cannot function in the presence of training data variation, then we should change the models, not the data. A model that only works when the students are all about the same level is not one we should rely on. We experiment with a simple model that relaxes some independence assumptions made by previous models, in order to allow training data variation (e.g. who a student has been paired with) to influence the estimation of the student abilities. Figure 1(left) shows plate notation (Koller and Friedman, 2009) for the model’s independence structure. First, each student’s ability distribution is drawn from a common prior distribution. Then a number of translation items are generated. Each item is authored by a student and has a quality drawn from the student’s ability distribution. Then a number of pairwise comparisons are generated. Each comparison has two options, each a translation item. The quality of each item is observed by a judge (possibly noisily) and then the judge states a preference by comparing the two observations. We investigate two parameterizations of this model: Gaussian and categorical. Figure 1(right) shows an example of the Gaussian parameterization. The student ability distributions are Gaussians with a known standard deviation σa, drawn from a zero-mean Gaussian prior with known standard deviation σ0. In the example, we show the ability distributions for students 6 (an aboveaverage student, whose mean is 0.4) and 14 (a poor student, whose mean is -0.6). We also show an item authored by each student. Item 43 has a somewhat low quality of -0.3 (drawn from student 14’s ability distribution), while item 205 is not student 6’s best work (he produces a mean quality of 0.4), but still has a decent quality at 0.2. Comparison 1pits these items against one another. A judge draws noise from a zero-mean Gaussian with known standard deviation σobs, then adds this to the item’s actual quality to get an observed quality. For the first option (item 43), the judge draws a noise of -0.12 to observe a quality of -0.42 (worse than it actually is). For the second option (item 205), the judge draws a noise of 0.15 to observe a quality of 0.35 (better than it actually is). Finally, the judge compares the two observed qualities. If the absolute difference is lower than his decision 1420 Figure 1: Plate notation (left) showing the independence tiated subnetwork structure of the IRT Models.

Shaded ellipses are variables observable from a set of comparisons. radius (which here is 0.5), then he states no preference (i.e. a preference of 0). Otherwise he prefers the item with the higher observed quality. The categorical parameterization is similar to the Gaussian parameterization, with the following differences. Item quality is not continuous, but rather a member of the discrete set {1, 2, ..., Λ}. rTahteh srtau d menetm ability tdhiest rdiibsuctrieotens are categorical distributions over {1, 2, ..., Λ}, and the student ability prior sis o a symmetric ,DΛir}ic,h alnetd dw tihthe strength αa.

Specifically, Pr(ν) is proportional to the value of the probability density function of the zero-mean Gaussian N(0, σobs). aWuses ieasntim Na(0te,dσ the model parameters with Gibbs sampling (Geman and Geman, 1984). We found that Gibbs sampling converged quickly and consistently10 for both parameterizations. Given the parameter estimates, we obtain a preference model Q(π|s1 , s2) through the inference query: Pr(comp.c0.pref = π | item.i0.author = s1, item.i00.author = s2 , comp.c0.opt1 = i0, comp.c0.opt2 = i00) − 10We ran 200 iterations with a burn-in of 50. where c0, i0, i00 are new comparison and item ids that do not appear in the training data. We call these models Item-Response Theoretic (IRT) models, to acknowledge their roots in the psychometrics (Thurstone, 1927; Bradley and Terry, 1952; Luce, 1959) and item-response theory (Hambleton, 1991 ; van der Linden and Hambleton, 1996; Baker, 2001) literature. Itemresponse theory is the basis of modern testing theory and drives adaptive standardized tests like the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). In particular, the Gaussian parameterization of our IRT models strongly resembles11 the Thurstone (Thurstone, 1927) and Bradley-Terry-Luce (Bradley and Terry, 1952; Luce, 1959) models of paired comparison and the 1PL normal-ogive and Rasch (Rasch, 1960) models of student testing. From the testing perspective, we can view each comparison as two students simultaneously posing a test question to the other: “Give me a translation of the source text which is better than mine.” The students can answer the question correctly, incorrectly, or they can provide a translation of analogous quality. An extra dimension of our models is judge noise, not a factor when modeling multiple-choice tests, for which the right answer is not subject to opinion. 11These models are not traditionally expressed using graphical models, although it is not unprecedented (Mislevy and Almond, 1997; Mislevy et al., 1999). 1421 (number of comparisons).

For each model and training size, we averaged the perplexities from 5 trials of each competition track. We then plotted average perplexity as a function of training size.

For WMT10 and WMT1 1, the best models were the IRT models, with the Gaussian parameterization converging the most rapidly and reaching the lowest perplexity. For WMT12, in which reference translations were excluded from the competition, four models were nearly indistinguishable: the two IRT models and the two averaged Independent Student models. This somewhat validates the organizers’ decision to exclude the references, particularly given WMT’s use of the BOJAR ranking heuristic (the nucleus of the Independent Student models) for its official rankings. 13Results for WMT10 exclude the German-English and English-German tracks, since we used these to tune our model hyperparameters. These were set as follows. The Dirichlet strength for each baseline was 1. For IRT-Gaussian: σ0 = 1.0, σobs = 1.0, σa = 0.5, and the decision radius was 0.4. For IRT-Categorical: Λ = 8, σobs = 1.0, αa = 0.5, and the decision radius was 0. 1422 Figure 6: English-Czech WMT1 1 results (average of 5 trainings on 1600 comparisons).

We repeated the WMT10 experiment using the same test sets, but using the unfiltered crowdsourced comparisons (rather than “expert”14 comparisons) for training. Figure 5 shows the results. Whereas the crowdsourced noise considerably degraded the Geometric Independent Students model, the IRT models were remarkably robust. IRT-Gaussian in particular came close to replicating the performance of Geometric Independent Students trained on the much cleaner expert data. This is rather impressive, since the crowdsourced judges agree only 46.6% of the time, compared to a 65.8% agreement rate among 14I.e., machine translation specialists. expert judges (Callison-Burch et al., 2010). Another nice property of the IRT models is that they explicitly model student ability, so they yield a natural ranking. For training size 1600 of the WMT1 1 English-Czech track, Figure 6 (left) shows the mean student abilities learned by the IRT-Gaussian model. The error bars show one standard deviation of the ability means (recall that we performed 5 trials, each with a random training subset of size 1600). These results provide further insight into a case analyzed by (Lopez, 2012), which raised concern about the relative ordering of online-B, cu-bojar, and cu-marecek. According to IRT-Gaussian’s analysis of the data, these three students are so close in ability that any ordering is essentially arbitrary. Short of a full ranking, the analysis does suggest four strata. Viewing one of IRT-Gaussian’s induced preference models as a heatmap15 (Figure 6, right), four bands are discernable. First, the reference sentences are clearly the darkest (best). Next come students 2-7, followed by the slightly lighter (weaker) students 810, followed by the lightest (weakest) student 11. 9 Conclusion WMT has faced a crisis of confidence lately, with researchers raising (real and conjectured) issues with its analytical methodology. In this paper, we showed how WMT can restore confidence in 15In the heatmap, cell (s1, s2) is darker ifpreference model Q(π|s1 , s2) skews in favor of student s1, lighter if it skews iQn (fπa|vsor of student s2. 1423 its conclusions – by shifting the focus from rank- ings to relative ability. Estimates of relative ability (the expected head-to-head performance of system pairs over a probability space of judges and source text) can be empirically compared, granting substance to previously nebulous questions like: 1. Is my analysis better than your analysis? Rather than the current anecdotal approach to comparing competition analyses (e.g. presenting example rankings that seem somehow wrong), we can empirically compare the predictive power of the models on test data. 2. How much of an impact does judge noise have on my conclusions? We showed that judge noise can have a significant impact on the quality of our conclusions, if we use the wrong models. However, the IRTGaussian appears to be quite noise-tolerant, giving similar-quality conclusions on both expert and crowdsourced comparisons. 3. How many comparisons should Ielicit? Many of our preference models (including IRT-Gaussian and Geometric Independent Students) are close to convergence at around 1000 comparisons. This suggests that we can elicit far fewer comparisons and still derive confident conclusions. This is the first time a concrete answer to this question has been provided. References F.B.

<p>Author: Guillaume Wisniewski</p><p>Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of collecting reliable human assessments. We show that knowing multiple scores for each example instead of a single score results in a more reliable estimation of a system quality. To reduce the cost of collecting these multiple ratings, we propose to use matrix completion techniques to predict some scores knowing only scores of other judges and some common ratings. Even if prediction performance is pretty low, decisions made using the predicted score proved to be more reliable than decision based on a single rating of each example.</p><p>2 0.77748346 <a title="263-lsi-2" href="./acl-2013-Models_of_Translation_Competitions.html">250 acl-2013-Models of Translation Competitions</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark Hopkins ; Jonathan May</p><p>Abstract: What do we want to learn from a translation competition and how do we learn it with confidence? We argue that a disproportionate focus on ranking competition participants has led to lots of different rankings, but little insight about which rankings we should trust. In response, we provide the first framework that allows an empirical comparison of different analyses of competition results. We then use this framework to compare several analytical models on data from the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT). 1 The WMT Translation Competition Every year, the Workshop on Machine Transla- , tion (WMT) conducts a competition between machine translation systems. The WMT organizers invite research groups to submit translation systems in eight different tracks: Czech to/from English, French to/from English, German to/from English, and Spanish to/from English. For each track, the organizers also assemble a panel of judges, typically machine translation specialists.1 The role of a judge is to repeatedly rank five different translations of the same source text. Ties are permitted. In Table 1, we show an example2 where a judge (we’ll call him “jdoe”) has ranked five translations of the French sentence “Il ne va pas.” Each such elicitation encodes ten pairwise comparisons, as shown in Table 2. For each competition track, WMT typically elicits between 5000 and 20000 comparisons. Once the elicitation process is complete, WMT faces a large database of comparisons and a question that must be answered: whose system is the best? 1Although in recent competitions, some ofthejudging has also been crowdsourced (Callison-Burch et al., 2010). 2The example does not use actual system output. jmay} @ sdl . com Table21r:a(451tniekW)MsTuycbejskhmtdeiunltmics“Hp r“eHt derfa eongris densolacstneogi tnsog.”bto. y”asking judges to simultaneously rank five translations, with ties permitted. In this (fictional) example, the source sentence is the French “Il ne va pas.” ble 1. A preference of 0 means neither translation was preferred. Otherwise the preference specifies the preferred system. 2 A Ranking Problem For several years, WMT used the following heuristic for ranking the translation systems: ORIGWMT(s) =win(sw)in +(s ti)e( +s t)ie +(s lo)ss(s) For system s, win (s) is the number of pairwise comparisons in which s was preferred, loss(s) is the number of comparisons in which s was dispreferred, and tie(s) is the number of comparisons in which s participated but neither system was preferred. Recently, (Bojar et al., 2011) questioned the adequacy of this heuristic through the following ar1416 Proce dingsS o f ita h,e B 5u1lgsta Arinan,u Aaulg Musete 4ti-n9g 2 o0f1 t3h.e ? Ac s2s0o1ci3a Atiosnso fcoirat Cio nm foprut Caotimonpaulta Lti nognuails Lti cnsg,u piasgteics 1416–1424, gument. Consider a competition with systems A and B. Suppose that the systems are different but equally good, such that one third of the time A is judged better than B, one third of the time B is judged better than A, and one third of the time they are judged to be equal. The expected values of ORIGWMT(A) and ORIGWMT(B) are both 2/3, so the heuristic accurately judges the systems to be equivalently good. Suppose however that we had duplicated B and had submitted it to the competition a second time as system C. Since B and C produce identical translations, they should always tie with one another. The expected value of ORIGWMT(A) would not change, but the expected value of ORIGWMT(B) would increase to 5/6, buoyed by its ties with system C. This vulnerability prompted (Bojar et al., 2011) to offer the following revision: BOJAR(s) =win(sw)in +(s lo)ss(s) The following year, it was BOJAR’s turn to be criticized, this time by (Lopez, 2012): Superficially, this appears to be an improvement....couldn’t a system still be penalized simply by being compared to [good systems] more frequently than its competitors? On the other hand, couldn’t a system be rewarded simply by being compared against a bad system more frequently than its competitors? Lopez’s concern, while reasonable, is less obviously damning than (Bojar et al., 2011)’s criticism of ORIGWMT. It depends on whether the collected set of comparisons is small enough or biased enough to make the variance in competition significant. While this hypothesis is plausible, Lopez makes no attempt to verify it. Instead, he offers a ranking heuristic of his own, based on a Minimum Feedback Arc solver. The proliferation of ranking heuristics continued from there. The WMT 2012 organizers (Callison-Burch et al., 2012) took Lopez’s ranking scheme and provided a variant called Most Proba- ble Ranking. Then, noting some potential pitfalls with that, they created two more, called Monte Carlo Playoffs and Expected Wins. While one could raise philosophical objections about each of these, where would it end? Ultimately, the WMT 2012 findings presented five different rankings for the English-German competition track, with no guidance about which ranking we should pay attention to. How can we know whether one ranking is better than other? Or is this even the right question to ask? 3 A Problem with Rankings Suppose four systems participate in a translation competition. Three of these systems are extremely close in quality. We’ll call these close1, close2, and close3. Nevertheless, close1 is very slightly better3 than close2, and close2 is very slightly better than close3. The fourth system, called terrific, is a really terrific system that far exceeds the other three. Now which is the better ranking? terrific, close3, close1, close2 close1, terrific, close2, close3 (1) (2) Spearman’s rho4 would favor the second ranking, since it is a less disruptive permutation of the gold ranking. But intuition favors the first. While its mistakes are minor, the second ranking makes the hard-to-forgive mistake of placing close1 ahead of the terrific system. The problem is not with Spearman’s rho. The problem is the disconnnect between the knowledge that we want a ranking to reflect and the knowledge that a ranking actually contains. Without this additional knowledge, we cannot determine whether one ranking is better than another, even if we know the gold ranking. We need to determine what information they lack, and define more rigorously what we hope to learn from a translation competition. 4 From Rankings to Relative Ability Ostensibly the purpose of a translation competition is to determine the relative ability of a set of translation systems. Let S be the space of all otrfan trsalnatsiloanti systems. Hereafter, we hwei lslp raecfeer o tfo Sll as nthslea space ostfe smtus.de Hntesr. a Wftee c,h woeos wei ltlh ires teerrm to t So evoke the metaphor of a translation competition as a standardized test, which shares the same goal: to assess the relative abilities of a set of participants. But what exactly do we mean by “ability”? Before formally defining this term, first recognize that it means little without context, namely: 3What does “better” mean? We’ll return to this question. 4Or Pearson’s correlation coefficient. 1417 1. What kind of source text do we want the systems to translate well? Say system A is great at translating travel-related documents, but terrible at translating newswire. Meanwhile, system B is pretty good at both. The question “which system is better?” requires us to state how much we care about travel versus newswire documents otherwise the question is underspecified. – 2. Who are we trying to impress? While it’s tempting to think that translation quality is a universal notion, the 50-60% interannotator agreement in WMT evaluations (CallisonBurch et al., 2012) suggests otherwise. It’s also easy to imagine reasons why one group of judges might have different priorities than another. Think a Fortune 500 company versus web forum users. Lawyers versus laymen. Non-native versus native speakers. Posteditors versus Google Translate users. Different groups have different uses for translation, and therefore different definitions of what “better” means. With this in mind, let’s define some additional elements of a translation competition. Let X be the space osf o afll a possible segments toitfi source text, J h bee tshpea space lolf p paolls possible judges, fa snodu rΠc = {0, 1, 2} bthee tshpea space ol fp pairwise d pgreesf,e arenndc Πes=. 5 W0,e1 assume all spaces are countable. Unless stated otherwise, variables s1 and s2 represent students from S, variable x represents a segment from X, variaSb,l ev j represents a judge af sroemgm J, ta fnrod mva Xria,b vlea π represents a preference fero fmro mΠ. J Moreover, adbelfein πe the negation ˆπ of preference π such that ˆπ = 2 (if π = 1), ˆπ = 1(if π = 2), and ˆπ = 0 (if π = 0). Now assume a joint distribution P(s1, s2, x, j,π) specifying the probability that we ask judge j to evaluate students s1 and s2’s respective translations of source text x, and that judge j’s preference is π. We will further assume that the choice of student pair, source text, and judge are marginally independent of one another. In other words: P(s1, s2, x, j,π) = P(π|s1, s2, x,j) · P(x|s1, s2, j) = ·P(j|s1,s2) · P(s1,s2) P(π|s1, s2, x, j) · P(x) · P(j) · P(s1, s2) = PX(x) · PJ(j) · P(s1, s2) · P(π|s1, s2, x,j) X(x) 5As a reminder, 0 indicates no preference. It will be useful to reserve notation PX and PJ for the marginal distributions over source text and judges. We can marginalize over the source segments and judges to obtain a useful quantity: P(π|s1, s2) = X XPX(x) · PJ(j) · P(π|s1,s2,x,j) Xx∈X Xj∈J We refer to this as the hPX, PJi-relative ability of Wstued reenftesr s1 hanisd a s2. By using d-rifeflearteinvet marginal distributions PX, we can specify what kinds of source text interest us (for instance, PX could focus most of its probability mass on German tweets). Similarly, by using different marginal distributions PJ, we can specify what judges we want to impress (for instance, PJ could focus all of its mass on one important corporate customer or evenly among all fluent bilingual speakers of a language pair). With this machinery, we can express the purpose of a translation competition more clearly: to estimate the hPX, PJi-relative ability of a set toof eststuidmenattes. Ien h Pthe case orefl WMT, PJ presumably6 defines a space of competent source-totarget bilingual speakers, while PX defines a space of newswire documents. We’ll refer to an estimate of P(π|s1 , s2) as a preference rm toode anl. Istni moattheer o words, a prefer- ence model is a distribution Q(π|s1 , s2). Given a cseet moofd pairwise comparisons (e.g., Table 2), the challenge is to estimate a preference model Q(π|s1 , s2) such that Q is “close” to P. For measuring distributional proximity, a natural choice is KL-divergence (Kullback and Leibler, 195 1), but we cannot use it here because P is unknown. Fortunately, ifwe have i.i.d. data drawn from P, then we can do the next best thing and compute the perplexity of preference model Q on this heldout test data. Let D be a sequence of triples hs1, s2, πi wteshter dea tah.e L preferences π are i o.if.d t.r samples fr,oπmi P(π|s1 , s2). The perplexity of preference model Q on stest data D is: perplexity(Q|D) = 2−Phs1,s2,πi∈D |D1|log2Q(π|s1,s2) How do we obtain such a test set from competition data? Recall that a WMT competition produces pairwise comparisons like those in Table 2. 6One could argue that it specifies a space of machine translation specialists, but likely these individuals are thought to be a representative sample of a broader community. 1418 Let C be the set of comparisons hs1, s2, x, j,πi Lobettai Cne bde f trhoem s a t orfan csolamtipoanr competition. ,Cjo,mπipetition data C is not necessarily7 sampled i.i.d. fpreotmiti P(s1, s2, x, j,π) n beeccaeusssaer we may intentionally8 bias data collection towards certain students, judges or source text. Also, because WMT elicits its data in batches (see Table 1), every segment x of source text appears in at least ten comparisons. To create an appropriately-sized test set that closely resembles i.i.d. data, we isolate the subset C0 of comparisons whose source text appears isne ta tC most k comparisons, where k is the smallest positive integer such that |C0| >= 2000. We then cporesaitteiv teh ien tteegste sre stu uDch hfr thomat |CC0: D = {hs1, s2, πi|hs1, s2, x,j, πi ∈ C0} We reserve the remaining comparisons for training preference models. Table 3 shows the resulting dataset sizes for each competition track. Unlike with raw rankings, the claim that one preference model is better than another has testable implications. Given two competing models, we can train them on the same comparisons, and compare their perplexities on the test set. This gives us a quantitative9 answer to the question of which is the better model. We can then publish a system ranking based on the most trustworthy preference model. 5 Baselines Let’s begin then, and create some simple preference models to serve as baselines. 5.1 Uniform The simplest preference model is a uniform distribution over preferences, for any choice of students s1 s2: , Q(π|s1,s2) =31 ∀π ∈ Π This will be our only model that does not require training data, and its perplexity on any test set will be 3 (i.e. equal to number of possible preferences). 5.2 Adjusted Uniform Now suppose we have a set C of comparisons aNvoawilab sluep pfoors training.

C(s1 , s2) denote the subset comparing students s1 aCn(ds s2. Perhaps the simplest thing we can do with the training data is to estimate the probability of ties (i.e. preference 0). We can then distribute the remaining probability mass uniformly among the other two preferences: 6SQim(pπ|lse1B,sa2y)e=sia   n1M−o2d|C Ce0| lsiofthπer=wi0se 6.1 Independent Pairs Another simple model is the direct estimation of each relative ability P(π|s1 , s2) independently. In oetahcher words, f aobri eliatych P pair sof students s1 and s2, we estimate a separate preference distribution. The maximum likelihood estimate of each distribution would be: Q(π|s1,s2) =|C|Cπ((ss11,,ss22))|| ++ | CC πˆ(s(2s,2s,1s)1|)| However the maximum likelihood estimate would test poorly, since any zero probability estimates for test set preferences would result in infinite perplexity. To make this model practical, we assume a symmetric Dirichlet prior with strength α for each preference distribution. This gives us the following Bayesian estimate: Q(π|s1,s2) =α3α + + |C |πC((ss11,,ss22))|| + + | |CC πˆ((ss22,,ss11))|| We call this the Independent model. Pairs preference 6.2 Independent Students The Independent Pairs model makes a strong inde- pendence assumption. It assumes that even if we know that student A is much better than student B, and that student B is much better than student C, we can infer nothing about how student A will fare versus student C. Instead of directly estimating the relative ability P(π|s1 , s2) of students s1 and s2, we ctoivueld a binilsittyead P Ptry tso estimate the universal ability P(π|s1) Ps2∈S P(π|s1, s2) · P(s2|s1) of ietaych P i(nπd|sividual sPtud∈enSt s1 πa|nsd the)n try tso reconstruct the relativeP abilities from these estimates.

QA( dπo|swnside of this approach is that there is no principled way to reconstruct a preference model from the universal ability estimates. We experiment with three ad-hoc reconstructions. The asymmetric reconstruction simply ignores any information we have about student s2: Q(π|s1, s2) = Q(π|s1) The arithmetic and geometric reconstructions compute an arithmetic/geometric average of the two universal abilities: Q(π|s1,s2) Q(π|s1, s2) = Q(π|s1) +2 Q( πˆ|s2) = [Q(π|s1) ∗ Q(ˆ π|s2)]21 We respectively call these the (Asymmetric/Arithmetic/Geometric) Independent Students preference models.

Presuming the students are paired uniformly at random, this issue diminishes as more comparisons are elicited. But preference elicitation is expensive, so it makes sense to assess the relative ability of the students with as few elicitations as possible. Still, WMT 2012’s decision to eliminate references entirely is a bit of a draconian measure, a treatment of the symptom rather than the (perceived) disease. If our models cannot function in the presence of training data variation, then we should change the models, not the data. A model that only works when the students are all about the same level is not one we should rely on. We experiment with a simple model that relaxes some independence assumptions made by previous models, in order to allow training data variation (e.g. who a student has been paired with) to influence the estimation of the student abilities. Figure 1(left) shows plate notation (Koller and Friedman, 2009) for the model’s independence structure. First, each student’s ability distribution is drawn from a common prior distribution. Then a number of translation items are generated. Each item is authored by a student and has a quality drawn from the student’s ability distribution. Then a number of pairwise comparisons are generated. Each comparison has two options, each a translation item. The quality of each item is observed by a judge (possibly noisily) and then the judge states a preference by comparing the two observations. We investigate two parameterizations of this model: Gaussian and categorical. Figure 1(right) shows an example of the Gaussian parameterization. The student ability distributions are Gaussians with a known standard deviation σa, drawn from a zero-mean Gaussian prior with known standard deviation σ0. In the example, we show the ability distributions for students 6 (an aboveaverage student, whose mean is 0.4) and 14 (a poor student, whose mean is -0.6). We also show an item authored by each student. Item 43 has a somewhat low quality of -0.3 (drawn from student 14’s ability distribution), while item 205 is not student 6’s best work (he produces a mean quality of 0.4), but still has a decent quality at 0.2. Comparison 1pits these items against one another. A judge draws noise from a zero-mean Gaussian with known standard deviation σobs, then adds this to the item’s actual quality to get an observed quality. For the first option (item 43), the judge draws a noise of -0.12 to observe a quality of -0.42 (worse than it actually is). For the second option (item 205), the judge draws a noise of 0.15 to observe a quality of 0.35 (better than it actually is). Finally, the judge compares the two observed qualities. If the absolute difference is lower than his decision 1420 Figure 1: Plate notation (left) showing the independence tiated subnetwork structure of the IRT Models.

Shaded ellipses are variables observable from a set of comparisons. radius (which here is 0.5), then he states no preference (i.e. a preference of 0). Otherwise he prefers the item with the higher observed quality. The categorical parameterization is similar to the Gaussian parameterization, with the following differences. Item quality is not continuous, but rather a member of the discrete set {1, 2, ..., Λ}. rTahteh srtau d menetm ability tdhiest rdiibsuctrieotens are categorical distributions over {1, 2, ..., Λ}, and the student ability prior sis o a symmetric ,DΛir}ic,h alnetd dw tihthe strength αa.

We found that Gibbs sampling converged quickly and consistently10 for both parameterizations. Given the parameter estimates, we obtain a preference model Q(π|s1 , s2) through the inference query: Pr(comp.c0.pref = π | item.i0.author = s1, item.i00.author = s2 , comp.c0.opt1 = i0, comp.c0.opt2 = i00) − 10We ran 200 iterations with a burn-in of 50. where c0, i0, i00 are new comparison and item ids that do not appear in the training data. We call these models Item-Response Theoretic (IRT) models, to acknowledge their roots in the psychometrics (Thurstone, 1927; Bradley and Terry, 1952; Luce, 1959) and item-response theory (Hambleton, 1991 ; van der Linden and Hambleton, 1996; Baker, 2001) literature. Itemresponse theory is the basis of modern testing theory and drives adaptive standardized tests like the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). In particular, the Gaussian parameterization of our IRT models strongly resembles11 the Thurstone (Thurstone, 1927) and Bradley-Terry-Luce (Bradley and Terry, 1952; Luce, 1959) models of paired comparison and the 1PL normal-ogive and Rasch (Rasch, 1960) models of student testing. From the testing perspective, we can view each comparison as two students simultaneously posing a test question to the other: “Give me a translation of the source text which is better than mine.” The students can answer the question correctly, incorrectly, or they can provide a translation of analogous quality. An extra dimension of our models is judge noise, not a factor when modeling multiple-choice tests, for which the right answer is not subject to opinion. 11These models are not traditionally expressed using graphical models, although it is not unprecedented (Mislevy and Almond, 1997; Mislevy et al., 1999). 1421 (number of comparisons). Figure 2: WMT10 model perplexities. The perplexity of the uniform preference model is 3.0 for all training sizes. 8 Experiments We organized the competition data as described at the end of Section 4.

For each model and training size, we averaged the perplexities from 5 trials of each competition track. We then plotted average perplexity as a function of training size. These graphs are shown 12If k was greater than the total number of training comparisons, then we took the entire set. Figure 3: WMT1 1model perplexities. Figure 4: WMT12 model perplexities. in Figure 2 (WMT10)13, and Figure 4 (WMT12). For WMT10 and WMT1 1, the best models were the IRT models, with the Gaussian parameterization converging the most rapidly and reaching the lowest perplexity. For WMT12, in which reference translations were excluded from the competition, four models were nearly indistinguishable: the two IRT models and the two averaged Independent Student models. This somewhat validates the organizers’ decision to exclude the references, particularly given WMT’s use of the BOJAR ranking heuristic (the nucleus of the Independent Student models) for its official rankings. 13Results for WMT10 exclude the German-English and English-German tracks, since we used these to tune our model hyperparameters. These were set as follows. The Dirichlet strength for each baseline was 1. For IRT-Gaussian: σ0 = 1.0, σobs = 1.0, σa = 0.5, and the decision radius was 0.4. For IRT-Categorical: Λ = 8, σobs = 1.0, αa = 0.5, and the decision radius was 0. 1422 Figure 6: English-Czech WMT1 1 results (average of 5 trainings on 1600 comparisons). Error bars (left) indicate one stddev of the estimated ability means.

Figure 5: WMT10 model perplexities sourced versus expert training). (crowd- The IRT models proved the most robust at handling judge noise. We repeated the WMT10 experiment using the same test sets, but using the unfiltered crowdsourced comparisons (rather than “expert”14 comparisons) for training. Figure 5 shows the results. Whereas the crowdsourced noise considerably degraded the Geometric Independent Students model, the IRT models were remarkably robust. IRT-Gaussian in particular came close to replicating the performance of Geometric Independent Students trained on the much cleaner expert data. This is rather impressive, since the crowdsourced judges agree only 46.6% of the time, compared to a 65.8% agreement rate among 14I.e., machine translation specialists. expert judges (Callison-Burch et al., 2010). Another nice property of the IRT models is that they explicitly model student ability, so they yield a natural ranking. For training size 1600 of the WMT1 1 English-Czech track, Figure 6 (left) shows the mean student abilities learned by the IRT-Gaussian model. The error bars show one standard deviation of the ability means (recall that we performed 5 trials, each with a random training subset of size 1600). These results provide further insight into a case analyzed by (Lopez, 2012), which raised concern about the relative ordering of online-B, cu-bojar, and cu-marecek. According to IRT-Gaussian’s analysis of the data, these three students are so close in ability that any ordering is essentially arbitrary. Short of a full ranking, the analysis does suggest four strata. Viewing one of IRT-Gaussian’s induced preference models as a heatmap15 (Figure 6, right), four bands are discernable. First, the reference sentences are clearly the darkest (best). Next come students 2-7, followed by the slightly lighter (weaker) students 810, followed by the lightest (weakest) student 11. 9 Conclusion WMT has faced a crisis of confidence lately, with researchers raising (real and conjectured) issues with its analytical methodology.

Estimates of relative ability (the expected head-to-head performance of system pairs over a probability space of judges and source text) can be empirically compared, granting substance to previously nebulous questions like: 1. Is my analysis better than your analysis? Rather than the current anecdotal approach to comparing competition analyses (e.g. presenting example rankings that seem somehow wrong), we can empirically compare the predictive power of the models on test data. 2. How much of an impact does judge noise have on my conclusions? We showed that judge noise can have a significant impact on the quality of our conclusions, if we use the wrong models. However, the IRTGaussian appears to be quite noise-tolerant, giving similar-quality conclusions on both expert and crowdsourced comparisons. 3. How many comparisons should Ielicit? Many of our preference models (including IRT-Gaussian and Geometric Independent Students) are close to convergence at around 1000 comparisons. This suggests that we can elicit far fewer comparisons and still derive confident conclusions. This is the first time a concrete answer to this question has been provided. References F.B.

They are usually trained on humanannotated datasets, which are very costly due to its task-specific nature. We investigate active learning techniques to reduce the size of these datasets and thus annotation effort. Experiments on a number of datasets show that with as little as 25% of the training instances it is possible to obtain similar or superior performance compared to that of the complete datasets. In other words, our active learning query strategies can not only reduce annotation effort but can also result in better quality predictors. ,t .</p><p>5 0.68019241 <a title="263-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Modelling_Annotator_Bias_with_Multi-task_Gaussian_Processes%3A_An_Application_to_Machine_Translation_Quality_Estimation.html">248 acl-2013-Modelling Annotator Bias with Multi-task Gaussian Processes: An Application to Machine Translation Quality Estimation</a></p>

Even with strict annotation guidelines, human subjects often deviate in their analyses, each bringing different biases, interpretations of the task and levels of consistency. We present novel techniques for learning from the outputs of multiple annotators while accounting for annotator specific behaviour. These techniques use multi-task Gaussian Processes to learn jointly a series of annotator and metadata specific models, while explicitly representing correlations between models which can be learned directly from data.

<p>Author: Tirthankar Dasgupta</p><p>Abstract: In this work we present psycholinguistically motivated computational models for the organization and processing of Bangla morphologically complex words in the mental lexicon. Our goal is to identify whether morphologically complex words are stored as a whole or are they organized along the morphological line. For this, we have conducted a series of psycholinguistic experiments to build up hypothesis on the possible organizational structure of the mental lexicon. Next, we develop computational models based on the collected dataset. We observed that derivationally suffixed Bangla words are in general decomposed during processing and compositionality between the stem . and the suffix plays an important role in the decomposition process. We observed the same phenomena for Bangla verb sequences where experiments showed noncompositional verb sequences are in general stored as a whole in the ML and low traces of compositional verbs are found in the mental lexicon. 1 IInnttrroodduuccttiioonn Mental lexicon is the representation of the words in the human mind and their associations that help fast retrieval and comprehension (Aitchison, 1987). Words are known to be associated with each other in terms of, orthography, phonology, morphology and semantics. However, the precise nature of these relations is unknown. An important issue that has been a subject of study for a long time is to identify the fundamental units in terms of which the mental lexicon is i itkgp .ernet . in organized. That is, whether lexical representations in the mental lexicon are word based or are they organized along morphological lines. For example, whether a word such as “unimaginable” is stored in the mental lexicon as a whole word or do we break it up “un-” , “imagine” and “able”, understand the meaning of each of these constituent and then recombine the units to comprehend the whole word. Such questions are typically answered by designing appropriate priming experiments (Marslen-Wilson et al., 1994) or other lexical decision tasks. The reaction time of the subjects for recognizing various lexical items under appropriate conditions reveals important facts about their organization in the brain. (See Sec. 2 for models of morphological organization and access and related experiments). A clear understanding of the structure and the processing mechanism of the mental lexicon will further our knowledge of how the human brain processes language. Further, these linguistically important and interesting questions are also highly significant for computational linguistics (CL) and natural language processing (NLP) applications. Their computational significance arises from the issue of their storage in lexical resources like WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and raises the questions like, how to store morphologically complex words, in a lexical resource like WordNet keeping in mind the storage and access efficiency. There is a rich literature on organization and lexical access of morphologically complex words where experiments have been conducted mainly for derivational suffixed words of English, Hebrew, Italian, French, Dutch, and few other languages (Marslen-Wilson et al., 2008; Frost et al., 1997; Grainger, et al., 1991 ; Drews and Zwitserlood, 1995). However, we do not know of any such investigations for Indian languages, which 123 Sofia, BuPrlgoacreiead, iAngusgu osft 4h-e9 A 2C01L3 S.tu ?c d2en0t1 3Re Ases aorc hiat Wio nrk fsohro Cp,om papguesta 1ti2o3n–a1l2 L9in,guistics are morphologically richer than many of their Indo-European cousins. Moreover, Indian languages show some distinct phenomena like, compound and composite verbs for which no such investigations have been conducted yet. On the other hand, experiments indicate that mental representation and processing of morphologically complex words are not quite language independent (Taft, 2004). Therefore, the findings from experiments in one language cannot be generalized to all languages making it important to conduct similar experimentations in other languages. This work aims to design cognitively motivated computational models that can explain the organization and processing of Bangla morphologically complex words in the mental lexicon. Presently we will concentrate on the following two aspects:   OOrrggaanniizzaattiioonn aanndd pprroocceessssiinngg ooff BBaannggllaa PPo o l yy-mmoorrpphheemmiicc wwoorrddss:: our objective here is to determine whether the mental lexicon decomposes morphologically complex words into its constituent morphemes or does it represent the unanalyzed surface form of a word. OOrrggaanniizzaattiioonn aanndd pprroocceessssiinngg ooff BBaannggllaa ccoomm-ppoouunndd vveerrbbss ((CCVV)) :: compound verbs are the subject of much debate in linguistic theory. No consensus has been reached yet with respect to the issue that whether to consider them as unitary lexical units or are they syntactically assembled combinations of two independent lexical units. As linguistic arguments have so far not led to a consensus, we here use cognitive experiments to probe the brain signatures of verb-verb combinations and propose cognitive as well as computational models regarding the possible organization and processing of Bangla CVs in the mental lexicon (ML). With respect to this, we apply the different priming and other lexical decision experiments, described in literature (Marslen-Wilson et al., 1994; Bentin, S. and Feldman, 1990) specifically for derivationally suffixed polymorphemic words and compound verbs of Bangla. Our cross-modal and masked priming experiment on Bangla derivationally suffixed words shows that morphological relatedness between lexical items triggers a significant priming effect, even when the forms are phonologically/orthographically unrelated. These observations are similar to those reported for English and indicate that derivationally suffixed words in Bangla are in general accessed through decomposition of the word into its constituent morphemes. Further, based on the experimental data we have developed a series of computational models that can be used to predict the decomposition of Bangla polymorphemic words. Our evaluation result shows that decom- position of a polymorphemic word depends on several factors like, frequency, productivity of the suffix and the compositionality between the stem and the suffix. The organization of the paper is as follows: Sec. 2 presents related works; Sec. 3 describes experiment design and procedure; Sec. 4 presents the processing of CVs; and finally, Sec. 5 concludes the paper by presenting the future direction of the work. 2 RReellaatteedd WWoorrkkss 2. . 11 RReepprreesseennttaattiioonn ooff ppoollyymmoorrpphheemmiicc wwoorrddss Over the last few decades many studies have attempted to understand the representation and processing of morphologically complex words in the brain for various languages. Most of the studies are designed to support one of the two mutually exclusive paradigms: the full-listing and the morphemic model. The full-listing model claims that polymorphic words are represented as a whole in the human mental lexicon (Bradley, 1980; Butterworth, 1983). On the other hand, morphemic model argues that morphologically complex words are decomposed and represented in terms of the smaller morphemic units. The affixes are stripped away from the root form, which in turn are used to access the mental lexicon (Taft and Forster, 1975; Taft, 1981 ; MacKay, 1978). Intermediate to these two paradigms is the partial decomposition model that argues that different types of morphological forms are processed separately. For instance, the derived morphological forms are believed to be represented as a whole, whereas the representation of the inflected forms follows the morphemic model (Caramazza et al., 1988). Traditionally, priming experiments have been used to study the effects of morphology in language processing. Priming is a process that results in increase in speed or accuracy of response to a stimulus, called the target, based on the occurrence of a prior exposure of another stimulus, called the prime (Tulving et al., 1982). Here, subjects are exposed to a prime word for a short duration, and are subsequently shown a target word. The prime and target words may be morphologically, phonologically or semantically re124 lated. An analysis of the effect of the reaction time of subjects reveals the actual organization and representation of the lexicon at the relevant level. See Pulvermüller (2002) for a detailed account of such phenomena. It has been argued that frequency of a word influences the speed of lexical processing and thus, can serve as a diagnostic tool to observe the nature and organization of lexical representations. (Taft, 1975) with his experiment on English inflected words, argued that lexical decision responses of polymorphemic words depends upon the base word frequency. Similar observation for surface word frequency was also observed by (Bertram et al., 2000;Bradley, 1980;Burani et al., 1987;Burani et al., 1984;Schreuder et al., 1997; Taft 1975;Taft, 2004) where it has been claimed that words having low surface frequency tends to decompose. Later, Baayen(2000) proposed the dual processing race model that proposes that a specific morphologically complex form is accessed via its parts if the frequency of that word is above a certain threshold of frequency, then the direct route will win, and the word will be accessed as a whole. If it is below that same threshold of frequency, the parsing route will win, and the word will be accessed via its parts. 2. . 22 RReepprreesseennttaattiioonn ooff CCoommppoouunndd A compound verb (CV) consists of two verbs (V1 and V2) acting as and expresses a single expression For example, in the sentence VVeerrbbss a sequence of a single verb of meaning. রুটিগুল ো খেল খেল ো (/ruTigulo kheYe phela/) ―bread-plural-the eat and drop-pres. Imp‖ ―Eat the breads‖ the verb sequence “খেল খেল ো (eat drop)” is an example of CV. Compound verbs are a special phenomena that are abundantly found in IndoEuropean languages like Indian languages. A plethora of works has been done to provide linguistic explanations on the formation of such word, yet none so far has led to any consensus. Hook (1981) considers the second verb V2 as an aspectual complex comparable to the auxiliaries. Butt (1993) argues CV formations in Hindi and Urdu are either morphological or syntactical and their formation take place at the argument struc- ture. Bashir (1993) tried to construct a semantic analysis based on “prepared” and “unprepared mind”. Similar findings have been proposed by Pandharipande (1993) that points out V1 and V2 are paired on the basis of their semantic compatibility, which is subject to syntactic constraints. Paul (2004) tried to represent Bangla CVs in terms of HPSG formalism. She proposes that the selection of a V2 by a V1 is determined at the semantic level because the two verbs will unify if and only if they are semantically compatible. Since none of the linguistic formalism could satisfactorily explain the unique phenomena of CV formation, we here for the first time drew our attention towards psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic studies to model the processing of verb-verb combinations in the ML and compare these responses with that of the existing models. 3 TThhee PPrrooppoosseedd AApppprrooaacchheess 3. . 11 TThhee ppssyycchhoolliinngguuiissttiicc eexxppeerriimmeennttss We apply two different priming experiments namely, the cross modal priming and masked priming experiment discussed in (Forster and Davis, 1984; Rastle et al., 2000;Marslen-Wilson et al., 1994; Marslen-Wilson et al., 2008) for Bangla morphologically complex words. Here, the prime is morphologically derived form of the target presented auditorily (for cross modal priming) or visually (for masked priming). The subjects were asked to make a lexical decision whether the given target is a valid word in that language. The same target word is again probed but with a different audio or visual probe called the control word. The control shows no relationship with the target. For example, baYaska (aged) and baYasa (age) is a prime-target pair, for which the corresponding control-target pair could be naYana (eye) and baYasa (age). Similar to (Marslen-Wilson et al., 2008) the masked priming has been conducted for three different SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony), 48ms, 72ms and 120ms. The SOA is measured as the amount of time between the start the first stimulus till the start of the next stimulus.

There were 500 prime-target and controltarget pairs classified into five classes. Depending on the class, the prime is related to the target 125 either in terms of morphology, semantics, orthography and/or Phonology (See Table 1). The experiments were conducted on 24 highly educated native Bangla speakers. Nineteen of them have a graduate degree and five hold a post graduate degree. The age of the subjects varies between 22 to 35 years. RReessuullttss:: The RTs with extreme values and incorrect decisions were excluded from the data. The data has been analyzed using two ways ANOVA with three factors: priming (prime and control), conditions (five classes) and prime durations (three different SOA). We observe strong priming effects (p<0.05) when the target word is morphologically derived and has a recognizable suffix, semantically and orthographically related with respect to the prime; no priming effects are observed when the prime and target words are orthographically related but share no morphological or semantic relationship; although not statistically significant (p>0.07), but weak priming is observed for prime target pairs that are only semantically related. We see no significant difference between the prime and control RTs for other classes. We also looked at the RTs for each of the 500 target words. We observe that maximum priming occurs for words in [M+S+O+](69%), some priming is evident in [M+S+O-](51%) and [M'+S-O+](48%), but for most of the words in [M-S+O-](86%) and [M-S-O+](92%) no priming effect was observed. 3. . 22 FFrreeqquueennccyy DDiissttrriibbuuttiioonn MMooddeellss ooff MMoo rrpphhoo-llooggiiccaall PPrroocceessssiinngg From the above results we saw that not all polymorphemic words tend to decompose during processing, thus we need to further investigate the processing phenomena of Bangla derived words. One notable means is to identify whether the stem or suffix frequency is involved in the processing stage of that word. For this, we apply different frequency based models to the Bangla polymorphemic words and try to evaluate their performance by comparing their predicted results with the result obtained through the priming experiment. MMooddeell --11:: BBaassee aanndd SSuurrffaaccee wwoorrdd ffrreeqquueennccyy ee ff-ffeecctt -- It states that the probability of decomposition of a Bangla polymorphemic word depends upon the frequency of its base word. Thus, if the stem frequency of a polymorphemic word crosses a given threshold value, then the word will decomposed into its constituent morpheme. Similar claim has been made for surface word frequency model where decomposition depends upon the frequency of the surface word itself. We have evaluated both the models with the 500 words used in the priming experiments discussed above. We have achieved an accuracy of 62% and 49% respectively for base and surface word frequency models. MMooddeell --22:: CCoommbbiinniinngg tthhee bbaassee aanndd ssuurrffaaccee wwoorrdd ffrreeq quueennccyy -- In a pursuit towards an extended model, we combine model 1 and 2 together. We took the log frequencies of both the base and the derived words and plotted the best-fit regression curve over the given dataset. The evaluation of this model over the same set of 500 target words returns an accuracy of 68% which is better than the base and surface word frequency models. However, the proposed model still fails to predict processing of around 32% of words. This led us to further enhance the model. For this, we analyze the role of suffixes in morphological processing. MMooddeell -- 33:: DDeeggrreeee ooff AAffffiixxaattiioonn aanndd SSuuffffiixx PPrroodd-uuccttiivviittyy:: we examine whether the regression analysis between base and derived frequency of Bangla words varies between suffixes and how these variations affect morphological decomposition. With respect to this, we try to compute the degree of affixation between the suffix and the base word. For this, we perform regression analysis on sixteen different Bangla suffixes with varying degree of type and token frequencies. For each suffix, we choose 100 different derived words. We observe that those suffixes having high value of intercept are forming derived words whose base frequencies are substantially high as compared to their derived forms. Moreover we also observe that high intercept value for a given suffix indicates higher inclination towards decomposition. Next, we try to analyze the role of suffix type/token ratio and compare them with the base/derived frequency ratio model. This has been done by regression analysis between the suffix type-token ratios with the base-surface frequency ratio. We further tried to observe the role of suffix productivity in morphological processing. For this, we computed the three components of productivity P, P* and V as discussed in (Hay and Plag, 2004). P is the “conditioned degree of productivity” and is the probability that we are encountering a word with an affix and it is representing a new type. P* is the “hapaxedconditioned degree of productivity”. It expresses the probability that when an entirely new word is 126 encountered it will contain the suffix. V is the “type frequency”. Finally, we computed the productivity of a suffix through its P, P* and V values. We found that decomposition of Bangla polymorphemic word is directly proportional to the productivity of the suffix. Therefore, words that are composed of productive suffixes (P value ranges between 0.6 and 0.9) like “-oYAlA”, “-giri”, “-tba” and “-panA” are highly decomposable than low productive suffixes like “-Ani”, “-lA”, “-k”, and “-tama”. The evaluation of the proposed model returns an accuracy of 76% which comes to be 8% better than the preceding models. CCoommbbiinniinngg MMooddeell --22 aanndd MMooddeell -- 33:: One important observation that can be made from the above results is that, model-3 performs best in determining the true negative values. It also possesses a high recall value of (85%) but having a low precision of (50%). In other words, the model can predict those words for which decomposition will not take place. On the other hand, results of Model-2 posses a high precision of 70%. Thus, we argue that combining the above two models can better predict the decomposition of Bangla polymorphemic words. Hence, we combine the two models together and finally achieved an overall accuracy of 80% with a precision of 87% and a recall of 78%. This surpasses the performance of the other models discussed earlier. However, around 22% of the test words were wrongly classified which the model fails to justify. Thus, a more rigorous set of experiments and data analysis are required to predict access mechanisms of such Bangla polymorphemic words. 3. . 33 SStteemm- -SSuuffffiixx CCoommppoossiittiioonnaalliittyy Compositionality refers to the fact that meaning of a complex expression is inferred from the meaning of its constituents. Therefore, the cost of retrieving a word from the secondary memory is directly proportional to the cost of retrieving the individual parts (i.e the stem and the suffix). Thus, following the work of (Milin et al., 2009) we define the compositionality of a morphologically complex word (We) as: C(We)=α 1H(We)+α α2H(e)+α α3H(W|e)+ α4H(e|W) Where, H(x) is entropy of an expression x, H(W|e) is the conditional entropy between the stem W and suffix e and is the proportionality factor whose value is computed through regression analysis. Next, we tried to compute the compositionality of the stem and suffixes in terms of relative entropy D(W||e) and Point wise mutual information (PMI). The relative entropy is the measure of the distance between the probability distribution of the stem W and the suffix e. The PMI measures the amount of information that one random variable (the stem) contains about the other (the suffix). We have compared the above three techniques with the actual reaction time data collected through the priming and lexical decision experiment. We observed that all the three information theoretic models perform much better than the frequency based models discussed in the earlier section, for predicting the decomposability of Bangla polymorphemic words. However, we think it is still premature to claim anything concrete at this stage of our work. We believe much more rigorous experiments are needed to be per- formed in order to validate our proposed models. Further, the present paper does not consider factors related to age of acquisition, and word familiarity effects that plays important role in the processing of morphologically complex words. Moreover, it is also very interesting to see how stacking of multiple suffixes in a word are processed by the human brain. 44 OOrrggaanniizzaattiioonn aanndd PPrroocceessssiinngg ooff CCoomm-ppoouunndd VVeerrbbss iinn tthhee MMeennttaall LLeexxiiccoonn Compound verbs, as discussed above, are special type of verb sequences consisting of two or more verbs acting as a single verb and express a single expression of meaning. The verb V1 is known as pole and V2 is called as vector. For example, “ওঠে পড়া ” (getting up) is a compound verb where individual words do not entirely reflects the meaning of the whole expression. However, not all V1+V2 combinations are CVs. For example, expressions like, “নিঠে য়াও ”(take and then go) and “ নিঠে আঠ ়া” (return back) are the examples of verb sequences where meaning of the whole expression can be derived from the mean- ing of the individual component and thus, these verb sequences are not considered as CV. The key question linguists are trying to identify for a long time and debating a lot is whether to consider CVs as a single lexical units or consider them as two separate units. Since linguistic rules fails to explain the process, we for the first time tried to perform cognitive experiments to understand the organization and processing of such verb sequences in the human mind. A clear understanding about these phenomena may help us to classify or extract actual CVs from other verb 127 sequences. In order to do so, presently we have applied three different techniques to collect user data. In the first technique, we annotated 4500 V1+V2 sequences, along with their example sentences, using a group of three linguists (the expert subjects). We asked the experts to classify the verb sequences into three classes namely, CV, not a CV and not sure. Each linguist has received 2000 verb pairs along with their respective example sentences. Out of this, 1500 verb sequences are unique to each of them and rest 500 are overlapping. We measure the inter annotator agreement using the Fleiss Kappa (Fleiss et al., 1981) measure (κ) where the agreement lies around 0.79. Next, out of the 500 common verb sequences that were annotated by all the three linguists, we randomly choose 300 V1+V2 pairs and presented them to 36 native Bangla speakers. We ask each subjects to give a compositionality score of each verb sequences under 1-10 point scale, 10 being highly compositional and 1 for noncompositional. We found an agreement of κ=0.69 among the subjects. We also observe a continuum of compositionality score among the verb sequences. This reflects that it is difficult to classify Bangla verb sequences discretely into the classes of CV and not a CV. We then, compare the compositionality score with that of the expert user’s annotation. We found a significant correlation between the expert annotation and the compositionality score. We observe verb sequences that are annotated as CVs (like, খেঠে খিল )কঠে খি ,ওঠে পড ,have got low compositionality score (average score ranges between 1-4) on the other hand high compositional values are in general tagged as not a cv (নিঠে য়া (come and get), নিঠে আে (return back), তুঠল খেঠেনি (kept), গনিঠে পিল (roll on floor)). This reflects that verb sequences which are not CV shows high degree of compositionality. In other words non CV verbs can directly interpret from their constituent verbs. This leads us to the possibility that compositional verb sequences requires individual verbs to be recognized separately and thus the time to recognize such expressions must be greater than the non-compositional verbs which maps to a single expression of meaning. In order to validate such claim we perform a lexical decision experiment using 32 native Bangla speakers with 92 different verb sequences. We followed the same experimental procedure as discussed in (Taft, 2004) for English polymorphemic words. However, rather than derived words, the subjects were shown a verb sequence and asked whether they recognize them as a valid combination. The reaction time (RT) of each subject is recorded. Our preliminarily observation from the RT analysis shows that as per our claim, RT of verb sequences having high compositionality value is significantly higher than the RTs for low or noncompositional verbs. This proves our hypothesis that Bangla compound verbs that show less compositionality are stored as a hole in the mental lexicon and thus follows the full-listing model whereas compositional verb phrases are individually parsed. However, we do believe that our experiment is composed of a very small set of data and it is premature to conclude anything concrete based only on the current experimental results. 5 FFuuttuurree DDiirreeccttiioonnss In the next phase of our work we will focus on the following aspects of Bangla morphologically complex words: TThhee WWoorrdd FFaammiilliiaarriittyy EEffffeecctt:: Here, our aim is to study the role of familiarity of a word during its processing.

<p>Author: Boxing Chen ; Roland Kuhn ; George Foster</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to domain adaptation in statistical machine translation (SMT) based on a vector space model (VSM). The general idea is first to create a vector profile for the in-domain development (“dev”) set. This profile might, for instance, be a vector with a dimensionality equal to the number of training subcorpora; each entry in the vector reflects the contribution of a particular subcorpus to all the phrase pairs that can be extracted from the dev set. Then, for each phrase pair extracted from the training data, we create a vector with features defined in the same way, and calculate its similarity score with the vector representing the dev set. Thus, we obtain a de- coding feature whose value represents the phrase pair’s closeness to the dev. This is a simple, computationally cheap form of instance weighting for phrase pairs. Experiments on large scale NIST evaluation data show improvements over strong baselines: +1.8 BLEU on Arabic to English and +1.4 BLEU on Chinese to English over a non-adapted baseline, and significant improvements in most circumstances over baselines with linear mixture model adaptation. An informal analysis suggests that VSM adaptation may help in making a good choice among words with the same meaning, on the basis of style and genre.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.90320587 <a title="263-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-On_the_Predictability_of_Human_Assessment%3A_when_Matrix_Completion_Meets_NLP_Evaluation.html">263 acl-2013-On the Predictability of Human Assessment: when Matrix Completion Meets NLP Evaluation</a></p>

We show that knowing multiple scores for each example instead of a single score results in a more reliable estimation of a system quality. To reduce the cost of collecting these multiple ratings, we propose to use matrix completion techniques to predict some scores knowing only scores of other judges and some common ratings. Even if prediction performance is pretty low, decisions made using the predicted score proved to be more reliable than decision based on a single rating of each example.</p><p>4 0.90027601 <a title="263-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Patient_Experience_in_Online_Support_Forums%3A_Modeling_Interpersonal_Interactions_and_Medication_Use.html">278 acl-2013-Patient Experience in Online Support Forums: Modeling Interpersonal Interactions and Medication Use</a></p>
<p>Author: Annie Chen</p><p>Abstract: Though there has been substantial research concerning the extraction of information from clinical notes, to date there has been less work concerning the extraction of useful information from patient-generated content. Using a dataset comprised of online support group discussion content, this paper investigates two dimensions that may be important in the extraction of patient-generated experiences from text; significant individuals/groups and medication use. With regard to the former, the paper describes an approach involving the pairing of important figures (e.g. family, husbands, doctors, etc.) and affect, and suggests possible applications of such techniques to research concerning online social support, as well as integration into search interfaces for patients.

We argue that a disproportionate focus on ranking competition participants has led to lots of different rankings, but little insight about which rankings we should trust. In response, we provide the first framework that allows an empirical comparison of different analyses of competition results. We then use this framework to compare several analytical models on data from the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT). 1 The WMT Translation Competition Every year, the Workshop on Machine Transla- , tion (WMT) conducts a competition between machine translation systems. The WMT organizers invite research groups to submit translation systems in eight different tracks: Czech to/from English, French to/from English, German to/from English, and Spanish to/from English. For each track, the organizers also assemble a panel of judges, typically machine translation specialists.1 The role of a judge is to repeatedly rank five different translations of the same source text. Ties are permitted. In Table 1, we show an example2 where a judge (we’ll call him “jdoe”) has ranked five translations of the French sentence “Il ne va pas.” Each such elicitation encodes ten pairwise comparisons, as shown in Table 2. For each competition track, WMT typically elicits between 5000 and 20000 comparisons. Once the elicitation process is complete, WMT faces a large database of comparisons and a question that must be answered: whose system is the best? 1Although in recent competitions, some ofthejudging has also been crowdsourced (Callison-Burch et al., 2010). 2The example does not use actual system output. jmay} @ sdl . com Table21r:a(451tniekW)MsTuycbejskhmtdeiunltmics“Hp r“eHt derfa eongris densolacstneogi tnsog.”bto. y”asking judges to simultaneously rank five translations, with ties permitted. In this (fictional) example, the source sentence is the French “Il ne va pas.” ble 1. A preference of 0 means neither translation was preferred. Otherwise the preference specifies the preferred system. 2 A Ranking Problem For several years, WMT used the following heuristic for ranking the translation systems: ORIGWMT(s) =win(sw)in +(s ti)e( +s t)ie +(s lo)ss(s) For system s, win (s) is the number of pairwise comparisons in which s was preferred, loss(s) is the number of comparisons in which s was dispreferred, and tie(s) is the number of comparisons in which s participated but neither system was preferred. Recently, (Bojar et al., 2011) questioned the adequacy of this heuristic through the following ar1416 Proce dingsS o f ita h,e B 5u1lgsta Arinan,u Aaulg Musete 4ti-n9g 2 o0f1 t3h.e ? Ac s2s0o1ci3a Atiosnso fcoirat Cio nm foprut Caotimonpaulta Lti nognuails Lti cnsg,u piasgteics 1416–1424, gument. Consider a competition with systems A and B. Suppose that the systems are different but equally good, such that one third of the time A is judged better than B, one third of the time B is judged better than A, and one third of the time they are judged to be equal. The expected values of ORIGWMT(A) and ORIGWMT(B) are both 2/3, so the heuristic accurately judges the systems to be equivalently good. Suppose however that we had duplicated B and had submitted it to the competition a second time as system C. Since B and C produce identical translations, they should always tie with one another. The expected value of ORIGWMT(A) would not change, but the expected value of ORIGWMT(B) would increase to 5/6, buoyed by its ties with system C. This vulnerability prompted (Bojar et al., 2011) to offer the following revision: BOJAR(s) =win(sw)in +(s lo)ss(s) The following year, it was BOJAR’s turn to be criticized, this time by (Lopez, 2012): Superficially, this appears to be an improvement....couldn’t a system still be penalized simply by being compared to [good systems] more frequently than its competitors? On the other hand, couldn’t a system be rewarded simply by being compared against a bad system more frequently than its competitors? Lopez’s concern, while reasonable, is less obviously damning than (Bojar et al., 2011)’s criticism of ORIGWMT. It depends on whether the collected set of comparisons is small enough or biased enough to make the variance in competition significant. While this hypothesis is plausible, Lopez makes no attempt to verify it. Instead, he offers a ranking heuristic of his own, based on a Minimum Feedback Arc solver. The proliferation of ranking heuristics continued from there. The WMT 2012 organizers (Callison-Burch et al., 2012) took Lopez’s ranking scheme and provided a variant called Most Proba- ble Ranking. Then, noting some potential pitfalls with that, they created two more, called Monte Carlo Playoffs and Expected Wins. While one could raise philosophical objections about each of these, where would it end? Ultimately, the WMT 2012 findings presented five different rankings for the English-German competition track, with no guidance about which ranking we should pay attention to. How can we know whether one ranking is better than other? Or is this even the right question to ask? 3 A Problem with Rankings Suppose four systems participate in a translation competition. Three of these systems are extremely close in quality. We’ll call these close1, close2, and close3. Nevertheless, close1 is very slightly better3 than close2, and close2 is very slightly better than close3. The fourth system, called terrific, is a really terrific system that far exceeds the other three. Now which is the better ranking? terrific, close3, close1, close2 close1, terrific, close2, close3 (1) (2) Spearman’s rho4 would favor the second ranking, since it is a less disruptive permutation of the gold ranking. But intuition favors the first. While its mistakes are minor, the second ranking makes the hard-to-forgive mistake of placing close1 ahead of the terrific system. The problem is not with Spearman’s rho. The problem is the disconnnect between the knowledge that we want a ranking to reflect and the knowledge that a ranking actually contains. Without this additional knowledge, we cannot determine whether one ranking is better than another, even if we know the gold ranking. We need to determine what information they lack, and define more rigorously what we hope to learn from a translation competition. 4 From Rankings to Relative Ability Ostensibly the purpose of a translation competition is to determine the relative ability of a set of translation systems. Let S be the space of all otrfan trsalnatsiloanti systems. Hereafter, we hwei lslp raecfeer o tfo Sll as nthslea space ostfe smtus.de Hntesr. a Wftee c,h woeos wei ltlh ires teerrm to t So evoke the metaphor of a translation competition as a standardized test, which shares the same goal: to assess the relative abilities of a set of participants. But what exactly do we mean by “ability”? Before formally defining this term, first recognize that it means little without context, namely: 3What does “better” mean? We’ll return to this question. 4Or Pearson’s correlation coefficient. 1417 1. What kind of source text do we want the systems to translate well? Say system A is great at translating travel-related documents, but terrible at translating newswire. Meanwhile, system B is pretty good at both. The question “which system is better?” requires us to state how much we care about travel versus newswire documents otherwise the question is underspecified. – 2. Who are we trying to impress? While it’s tempting to think that translation quality is a universal notion, the 50-60% interannotator agreement in WMT evaluations (CallisonBurch et al., 2012) suggests otherwise. It’s also easy to imagine reasons why one group of judges might have different priorities than another. Think a Fortune 500 company versus web forum users. Lawyers versus laymen. Non-native versus native speakers. Posteditors versus Google Translate users. Different groups have different uses for translation, and therefore different definitions of what “better” means. With this in mind, let’s define some additional elements of a translation competition. Let X be the space osf o afll a possible segments toitfi source text, J h bee tshpea space lolf p paolls possible judges, fa snodu rΠc = {0, 1, 2} bthee tshpea space ol fp pairwise d pgreesf,e arenndc Πes=. 5 W0,e1 assume all spaces are countable. Unless stated otherwise, variables s1 and s2 represent students from S, variable x represents a segment from X, variaSb,l ev j represents a judge af sroemgm J, ta fnrod mva Xria,b vlea π represents a preference fero fmro mΠ. J Moreover, adbelfein πe the negation ˆπ of preference π such that ˆπ = 2 (if π = 1), ˆπ = 1(if π = 2), and ˆπ = 0 (if π = 0). Now assume a joint distribution P(s1, s2, x, j,π) specifying the probability that we ask judge j to evaluate students s1 and s2’s respective translations of source text x, and that judge j’s preference is π. We will further assume that the choice of student pair, source text, and judge are marginally independent of one another. In other words: P(s1, s2, x, j,π) = P(π|s1, s2, x,j) · P(x|s1, s2, j) = ·P(j|s1,s2) · P(s1,s2) P(π|s1, s2, x, j) · P(x) · P(j) · P(s1, s2) = PX(x) · PJ(j) · P(s1, s2) · P(π|s1, s2, x,j) X(x) 5As a reminder, 0 indicates no preference. It will be useful to reserve notation PX and PJ for the marginal distributions over source text and judges. We can marginalize over the source segments and judges to obtain a useful quantity: P(π|s1, s2) = X XPX(x) · PJ(j) · P(π|s1,s2,x,j) Xx∈X Xj∈J We refer to this as the hPX, PJi-relative ability of Wstued reenftesr s1 hanisd a s2. By using d-rifeflearteinvet marginal distributions PX, we can specify what kinds of source text interest us (for instance, PX could focus most of its probability mass on German tweets). Similarly, by using different marginal distributions PJ, we can specify what judges we want to impress (for instance, PJ could focus all of its mass on one important corporate customer or evenly among all fluent bilingual speakers of a language pair). With this machinery, we can express the purpose of a translation competition more clearly: to estimate the hPX, PJi-relative ability of a set toof eststuidmenattes. Ien h Pthe case orefl WMT, PJ presumably6 defines a space of competent source-totarget bilingual speakers, while PX defines a space of newswire documents. We’ll refer to an estimate of P(π|s1 , s2) as a preference rm toode anl. Istni moattheer o words, a prefer- ence model is a distribution Q(π|s1 , s2). Given a cseet moofd pairwise comparisons (e.g., Table 2), the challenge is to estimate a preference model Q(π|s1 , s2) such that Q is “close” to P. For measuring distributional proximity, a natural choice is KL-divergence (Kullback and Leibler, 195 1), but we cannot use it here because P is unknown. Fortunately, ifwe have i.i.d. data drawn from P, then we can do the next best thing and compute the perplexity of preference model Q on this heldout test data. Let D be a sequence of triples hs1, s2, πi wteshter dea tah.e L preferences π are i o.if.d t.r samples fr,oπmi P(π|s1 , s2). The perplexity of preference model Q on stest data D is: perplexity(Q|D) = 2−Phs1,s2,πi∈D |D1|log2Q(π|s1,s2) How do we obtain such a test set from competition data? Recall that a WMT competition produces pairwise comparisons like those in Table 2. 6One could argue that it specifies a space of machine translation specialists, but likely these individuals are thought to be a representative sample of a broader community. 1418 Let C be the set of comparisons hs1, s2, x, j,πi Lobettai Cne bde f trhoem s a t orfan csolamtipoanr competition. ,Cjo,mπipetition data C is not necessarily7 sampled i.i.d. fpreotmiti P(s1, s2, x, j,π) n beeccaeusssaer we may intentionally8 bias data collection towards certain students, judges or source text. Also, because WMT elicits its data in batches (see Table 1), every segment x of source text appears in at least ten comparisons. To create an appropriately-sized test set that closely resembles i.i.d. data, we isolate the subset C0 of comparisons whose source text appears isne ta tC most k comparisons, where k is the smallest positive integer such that |C0| >= 2000. We then cporesaitteiv teh ien tteegste sre stu uDch hfr thomat |CC0: D = {hs1, s2, πi|hs1, s2, x,j, πi ∈ C0} We reserve the remaining comparisons for training preference models. Table 3 shows the resulting dataset sizes for each competition track. Unlike with raw rankings, the claim that one preference model is better than another has testable implications. Given two competing models, we can train them on the same comparisons, and compare their perplexities on the test set. This gives us a quantitative9 answer to the question of which is the better model. We can then publish a system ranking based on the most trustworthy preference model. 5 Baselines Let’s begin then, and create some simple preference models to serve as baselines. 5.1 Uniform The simplest preference model is a uniform distribution over preferences, for any choice of students s1 s2: , Q(π|s1,s2) =31 ∀π ∈ Π This will be our only model that does not require training data, and its perplexity on any test set will be 3 (i.e. equal to number of possible preferences). 5.2 Adjusted Uniform Now suppose we have a set C of comparisons aNvoawilab sluep pfoors training.

C(s1 , s2) denote the subset comparing students s1 aCn(ds s2. Perhaps the simplest thing we can do with the training data is to estimate the probability of ties (i.e. preference 0). We can then distribute the remaining probability mass uniformly among the other two preferences: 6SQim(pπ|lse1B,sa2y)e=sia   n1M−o2d|C Ce0| lsiofthπer=wi0se 6.1 Independent Pairs Another simple model is the direct estimation of each relative ability P(π|s1 , s2) independently. In oetahcher words, f aobri eliatych P pair sof students s1 and s2, we estimate a separate preference distribution. The maximum likelihood estimate of each distribution would be: Q(π|s1,s2) =|C|Cπ((ss11,,ss22))|| ++ | CC πˆ(s(2s,2s,1s)1|)| However the maximum likelihood estimate would test poorly, since any zero probability estimates for test set preferences would result in infinite perplexity. To make this model practical, we assume a symmetric Dirichlet prior with strength α for each preference distribution. This gives us the following Bayesian estimate: Q(π|s1,s2) =α3α + + |C |πC((ss11,,ss22))|| + + | |CC πˆ((ss22,,ss11))|| We call this the Independent model. Pairs preference 6.2 Independent Students The Independent Pairs model makes a strong inde- pendence assumption. It assumes that even if we know that student A is much better than student B, and that student B is much better than student C, we can infer nothing about how student A will fare versus student C. Instead of directly estimating the relative ability P(π|s1 , s2) of students s1 and s2, we ctoivueld a binilsittyead P Ptry tso estimate the universal ability P(π|s1) Ps2∈S P(π|s1, s2) · P(s2|s1) of ietaych P i(nπd|sividual sPtud∈enSt s1 πa|nsd the)n try tso reconstruct the relativeP abilities from these estimates.

QA( dπo|swnside of this approach is that there is no principled way to reconstruct a preference model from the universal ability estimates. We experiment with three ad-hoc reconstructions. The asymmetric reconstruction simply ignores any information we have about student s2: Q(π|s1, s2) = Q(π|s1) The arithmetic and geometric reconstructions compute an arithmetic/geometric average of the two universal abilities: Q(π|s1,s2) Q(π|s1, s2) = Q(π|s1) +2 Q( πˆ|s2) = [Q(π|s1) ∗ Q(ˆ π|s2)]21 We respectively call these the (Asymmetric/Arithmetic/Geometric) Independent Students preference models.

Presuming the students are paired uniformly at random, this issue diminishes as more comparisons are elicited. But preference elicitation is expensive, so it makes sense to assess the relative ability of the students with as few elicitations as possible. Still, WMT 2012’s decision to eliminate references entirely is a bit of a draconian measure, a treatment of the symptom rather than the (perceived) disease. If our models cannot function in the presence of training data variation, then we should change the models, not the data. A model that only works when the students are all about the same level is not one we should rely on. We experiment with a simple model that relaxes some independence assumptions made by previous models, in order to allow training data variation (e.g. who a student has been paired with) to influence the estimation of the student abilities. Figure 1(left) shows plate notation (Koller and Friedman, 2009) for the model’s independence structure. First, each student’s ability distribution is drawn from a common prior distribution. Then a number of translation items are generated. Each item is authored by a student and has a quality drawn from the student’s ability distribution. Then a number of pairwise comparisons are generated. Each comparison has two options, each a translation item. The quality of each item is observed by a judge (possibly noisily) and then the judge states a preference by comparing the two observations. We investigate two parameterizations of this model: Gaussian and categorical. Figure 1(right) shows an example of the Gaussian parameterization. The student ability distributions are Gaussians with a known standard deviation σa, drawn from a zero-mean Gaussian prior with known standard deviation σ0. In the example, we show the ability distributions for students 6 (an aboveaverage student, whose mean is 0.4) and 14 (a poor student, whose mean is -0.6). We also show an item authored by each student. Item 43 has a somewhat low quality of -0.3 (drawn from student 14’s ability distribution), while item 205 is not student 6’s best work (he produces a mean quality of 0.4), but still has a decent quality at 0.2. Comparison 1pits these items against one another. A judge draws noise from a zero-mean Gaussian with known standard deviation σobs, then adds this to the item’s actual quality to get an observed quality. For the first option (item 43), the judge draws a noise of -0.12 to observe a quality of -0.42 (worse than it actually is). For the second option (item 205), the judge draws a noise of 0.15 to observe a quality of 0.35 (better than it actually is). Finally, the judge compares the two observed qualities. If the absolute difference is lower than his decision 1420 Figure 1: Plate notation (left) showing the independence tiated subnetwork structure of the IRT Models.

Shaded ellipses are variables observable from a set of comparisons. radius (which here is 0.5), then he states no preference (i.e. a preference of 0). Otherwise he prefers the item with the higher observed quality. The categorical parameterization is similar to the Gaussian parameterization, with the following differences. Item quality is not continuous, but rather a member of the discrete set {1, 2, ..., Λ}. rTahteh srtau d menetm ability tdhiest rdiibsuctrieotens are categorical distributions over {1, 2, ..., Λ}, and the student ability prior sis o a symmetric ,DΛir}ic,h alnetd dw tihthe strength αa.

Specifically, Pr(ν) is proportional to the value of the probability density function of the zero-mean Gaussian N(0, σobs). aWuses ieasntim Na(0te,dσ the model parameters with Gibbs sampling (Geman and Geman, 1984). We found that Gibbs sampling converged quickly and consistently10 for both parameterizations. Given the parameter estimates, we obtain a preference model Q(π|s1 , s2) through the inference query: Pr(comp.c0.pref = π | item.i0.author = s1, item.i00.author = s2 , comp.c0.opt1 = i0, comp.c0.opt2 = i00) − 10We ran 200 iterations with a burn-in of 50. where c0, i0, i00 are new comparison and item ids that do not appear in the training data. We call these models Item-Response Theoretic (IRT) models, to acknowledge their roots in the psychometrics (Thurstone, 1927; Bradley and Terry, 1952; Luce, 1959) and item-response theory (Hambleton, 1991 ; van der Linden and Hambleton, 1996; Baker, 2001) literature. Itemresponse theory is the basis of modern testing theory and drives adaptive standardized tests like the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). In particular, the Gaussian parameterization of our IRT models strongly resembles11 the Thurstone (Thurstone, 1927) and Bradley-Terry-Luce (Bradley and Terry, 1952; Luce, 1959) models of paired comparison and the 1PL normal-ogive and Rasch (Rasch, 1960) models of student testing. From the testing perspective, we can view each comparison as two students simultaneously posing a test question to the other: “Give me a translation of the source text which is better than mine.” The students can answer the question correctly, incorrectly, or they can provide a translation of analogous quality. An extra dimension of our models is judge noise, not a factor when modeling multiple-choice tests, for which the right answer is not subject to opinion. 11These models are not traditionally expressed using graphical models, although it is not unprecedented (Mislevy and Almond, 1997; Mislevy et al., 1999). 1421 (number of comparisons). Figure 2: WMT10 model perplexities. The perplexity of the uniform preference model is 3.0 for all training sizes. 8 Experiments We organized the competition data as described at the end of Section 4.

For each model and training size, we averaged the perplexities from 5 trials of each competition track. We then plotted average perplexity as a function of training size. These graphs are shown 12If k was greater than the total number of training comparisons, then we took the entire set. Figure 3: WMT1 1model perplexities. Figure 4: WMT12 model perplexities. in Figure 2 (WMT10)13, and Figure 4 (WMT12). For WMT10 and WMT1 1, the best models were the IRT models, with the Gaussian parameterization converging the most rapidly and reaching the lowest perplexity. For WMT12, in which reference translations were excluded from the competition, four models were nearly indistinguishable: the two IRT models and the two averaged Independent Student models. This somewhat validates the organizers’ decision to exclude the references, particularly given WMT’s use of the BOJAR ranking heuristic (the nucleus of the Independent Student models) for its official rankings. 13Results for WMT10 exclude the German-English and English-German tracks, since we used these to tune our model hyperparameters. These were set as follows. The Dirichlet strength for each baseline was 1. For IRT-Gaussian: σ0 = 1.0, σobs = 1.0, σa = 0.5, and the decision radius was 0.4. For IRT-Categorical: Λ = 8, σobs = 1.0, αa = 0.5, and the decision radius was 0. 1422 Figure 6: English-Czech WMT1 1 results (average of 5 trainings on 1600 comparisons).

Figure 5: WMT10 model perplexities sourced versus expert training). (crowd- The IRT models proved the most robust at handling judge noise. We repeated the WMT10 experiment using the same test sets, but using the unfiltered crowdsourced comparisons (rather than “expert”14 comparisons) for training. Figure 5 shows the results. Whereas the crowdsourced noise considerably degraded the Geometric Independent Students model, the IRT models were remarkably robust. IRT-Gaussian in particular came close to replicating the performance of Geometric Independent Students trained on the much cleaner expert data. This is rather impressive, since the crowdsourced judges agree only 46.6% of the time, compared to a 65.8% agreement rate among 14I.e., machine translation specialists. expert judges (Callison-Burch et al., 2010). Another nice property of the IRT models is that they explicitly model student ability, so they yield a natural ranking. For training size 1600 of the WMT1 1 English-Czech track, Figure 6 (left) shows the mean student abilities learned by the IRT-Gaussian model. The error bars show one standard deviation of the ability means (recall that we performed 5 trials, each with a random training subset of size 1600). These results provide further insight into a case analyzed by (Lopez, 2012), which raised concern about the relative ordering of online-B, cu-bojar, and cu-marecek. According to IRT-Gaussian’s analysis of the data, these three students are so close in ability that any ordering is essentially arbitrary. Short of a full ranking, the analysis does suggest four strata. Viewing one of IRT-Gaussian’s induced preference models as a heatmap15 (Figure 6, right), four bands are discernable. First, the reference sentences are clearly the darkest (best). Next come students 2-7, followed by the slightly lighter (weaker) students 810, followed by the lightest (weakest) student 11. 9 Conclusion WMT has faced a crisis of confidence lately, with researchers raising (real and conjectured) issues with its analytical methodology.

Estimates of relative ability (the expected head-to-head performance of system pairs over a probability space of judges and source text) can be empirically compared, granting substance to previously nebulous questions like: 1. Is my analysis better than your analysis? Rather than the current anecdotal approach to comparing competition analyses (e.g. presenting example rankings that seem somehow wrong), we can empirically compare the predictive power of the models on test data. 2. How much of an impact does judge noise have on my conclusions? We showed that judge noise can have a significant impact on the quality of our conclusions, if we use the wrong models. However, the IRTGaussian appears to be quite noise-tolerant, giving similar-quality conclusions on both expert and crowdsourced comparisons. 3. How many comparisons should Ielicit? Many of our preference models (including IRT-Gaussian and Geometric Independent Students) are close to convergence at around 1000 comparisons. This suggests that we can elicit far fewer comparisons and still derive confident conclusions. This is the first time a concrete answer to this question has been provided. References F.B.

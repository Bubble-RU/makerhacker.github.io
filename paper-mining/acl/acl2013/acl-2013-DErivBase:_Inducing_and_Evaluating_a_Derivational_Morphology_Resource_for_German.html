</p><p>4 Part of the reason for the relative lack→ of attention lies in the morphological properties of English, such as the presence of many zero derivations (the fish → to fish), the dominance of suffixation, and the r→elative absence of stem changes in derivation. [sent-20, score-0.31]

</p><p>8 In this paper, we describe the project of obtain-  ing derivational knowledge for German to enable similar applications. [sent-44, score-0.693]
</p><p>9 Even though there are two derivational resources for this language, IMSLEX (Fitschen, 2004) and CELEX (Baayen et al. [sent-45, score-0.693]
</p><p>10 The former does not appear to be publicly available, and the latter has a limited coverage (50k lemmas) and does not explicitly represent derivational relationships within families, which are necessary for fine-grained optimization of families. [sent-47, score-0.732]
</p><p>11 For this reason, we look into building a novel derivational resource for German. [sent-48, score-0.727]
</p><p>12 Instead, we employ a rule-based framework to define derivation rules that cover both suffixation and prefixation and describes stem changes. [sent-51, score-0.707]
</p><p>13 Following the work of Šnajder and Dalbelo Baši c´ (2010), we define the derivational processes using derivational rules and higher-order string transformation functions. [sent-52, score-1.649]
</p><p>14 The derivational rules induce  a partition of the language’s lemmas into derivational families. [sent-53, score-1.764]
</p><p>15 Our method is applicable to many languages if the following are available: (1) a comprehensive set of lemmas (optionally including gender information); (2) knowledge about admissible derivational patterns, which can be gathered, for example, from linguistics textbooks. [sent-54, score-0.987]
</p><p>16 The result is a freely available high-precision high-coverage resource for German derivational morphology that has a structure parallel to CatVar, but was obtained without using manually constructed lexical-semantic resources. [sent-55, score-0.815]
</p><p>17 We conduct a thorough evaluation of the induced derivational families both regarding precision and recall. [sent-56, score-0.972]
</p><p>18 They are either based solely on corpus statistics (Déjean, 1998), measure semantic similarity between input and output lemma (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000), or bootstrap derivation rules starting from seed examples (Piasecki et al. [sent-66, score-0.361]
</p><p>19 An exception is the work by Gaussier (1999),  who applies an unsupervised model to construct derivational families for French. [sent-71, score-0.876]
</p><p>20 The site canoonet1 offers broad-coverage information about the German language including derivational word formation. [sent-78, score-0.693]
</p><p>21 3  Framework  In this section, we describe our rule-based model of derivation, its operation to define derivational families, and the application of the model to German. [sent-79, score-0.693]
</p><p>22 We begin by outlining the characteristics of German derivational morphology. [sent-83, score-0.693]
</p><p>23 1 German Derivational Morphology As German is a morphologically complex language, we analyzed its derivation processes before implementing our rule-based model. [sent-85, score-0.233]
</p><p>24 We concentrate on German derivational processes that involve nouns, verbs, and adjectives. [sent-90, score-0.733]
</p><p>25 An example of a derived verb isfestA –festigen (tight to tighten), where -ig is the derivational suffix. [sent-93, score-0.72]
</p><p>26 This example shows that derivation can also involve stem changes in the form of umlaut (e. [sent-95, score-0.333]
</p><p>27 Other frequent processes in German derivation are circumfixation (HaftN inhaftieren (arrest to arrest)) and prefixation (heben V beheben V (to raise to remedy)). [sent-100, score-0.433]
</p><p>28 As this analysis shows, derivation in German involves transformation as well as affixation processes, which has to be taken into account when modeling a derivational resource. [sent-107, score-0.897]
</p><p>29 2 A Rule-based Derivation Model The purpose of a derivational model is to define a set of transformations that correspond to valid derivational word formation rules. [sent-109, score-1.414]
</p><p>30 Rule-based frameworks offer convenient representations for derivational morphology because they can take advantage of linguistic knowledge about derivation, have interpretable representations, and can be fine-  tuned for high precision. [sent-110, score-0.781]
</p><p>31 The choice of the framework is in principle arbitrary, as long as it can conveniently express the derivational phenomena of a language. [sent-111, score-0.693]
</p><p>32 Typically used for this purpose are two-level formalism rules (Karttunen and Beesley, 1992) or XFST replace rules (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003). [sent-112, score-0.256]
</p><p>33 The expressiveness of the formalism is equivalent to the replacement rules commonly used in finite state frameworks, thus the rules can be compiled into FSTs for efficient processing. [sent-117, score-0.285]
</p><p>34 The framework makes a clear distinction between inflectional and derivational morphology and provides separate modeling components for these two; we only make use of the derivation modeling  component. [sent-118, score-1.006]
</p><p>35 The building blocks of the derivational component are derivational rules (patterns) and transformation functions. [sent-121, score-1.571]
</p><p>36 A derivational rule describes the derivation of a derived word from a basis word. [sent-122, score-0.951]
</p><p>37 The framework then uses the notion of higher-order functions functions that take other transformations as arguments and return new transformations as results to succinctly define common derivational processes such as prefixation, suffixation, and stem change. [sent-127, score-0.903]
</p><p>38 More complex word-formation rules, such as those combining prefixation and suffixation, can be obtained straightforwardly by functional composition. [sent-128, score-0.203]
</p><p>39 Table 1 summarizes the syntax we use for transformation functions and shows two example derivational rules. [sent-129, score-0.75]
</p><p>40 optional umlaut creation”  Table 1: Transformation functions and exemplary derivational rules in the framework by and Dalbelo Baši c´ (2010)  Šnajder  N and A denote the paradigms for nouns (without gender restriction) and adjectives, respectively. [sent-148, score-1.042]
</p><p>41 3  Induction of Derivational Families  Recall that our goal is to induce derivational families, that is, classes of derivationally related words. [sent-150, score-0.776]
</p><p>42 We define derivational families on the basis of  derivational rules as follows. [sent-151, score-1.73]
</p><p>43 Given a lemma-paradigm pair (l,p) as input, a single derivational rule d = (t, P1, P2) generates a set of possible dedriv =atio (tn,sP Ld(l, p) = {(l1,p1) , . [sent-152, score-0.744]
</p><p>44 Given a set o)f} derivatipon ∈al P rules D, we Pdefine a binary derivation relation →D betwDeen two lemma-paradigm pairs that holds →if the second pair can be derived from the first one as:  iff  (l1, p1) →D (l2, p2) ∃d ∈ D. [sent-156, score-0.347]
</p><p>45 The set oLf derivational families defined by D on L is given by the equivalence classes of theD transitive, symmetric, and reflexive closure of →D over L. [sent-158, score-0.876]
</p><p>46 High coverage of L is important because the transitivity of →D ranges only over lemmas in L, so low coverage →of L may result in fragmented dLerivational families. [sent-160, score-0.328]
</p><p>47 The reason is that the derivational rules only define admissible derivations, which need not be morphologically valid, and therefore routinely overgenerate; L plays an important role in filtering out derivationLs that are not attested in the data. [sent-162, score-0.867]
</p><p>48 1 Derivational Rules We implemented the derivational rules from Hoeppner (1980) for verbs, nouns, and adjectives, covering all processes described in Section 3. [sent-164, score-0.861]
</p><p>49 We found many derivational patterns in German to be conceptually simple (e. [sent-166, score-0.693]
</p><p>50 , suffixation combined with optional stem changes) that in sum also affect a considerable number of lemmas, which required us to either implement low-coverage rules or generalize existing rules. [sent-171, score-0.357]
</p><p>51 In order to preserve  precision as much as possible, we restricted rule application by using try instead of opt, and by using gender information from the noun paradigms (for example, some rules only apply to masculine nouns and produce female nouns). [sent-172, score-0.383]
</p><p>52 As a result, we end up with high-coverage rules, such as derivations of person-denoting nouns (SchuleN SchülerN (school pupil)) as well as high-accuracy rules such as negation prefixes (PolN GegenpolN (pole antipole)). [sent-173, score-0.311]
</p><p>53 We had to resort to heuristics mostly for words with derivational transformations that are motivated by Latin or Greek morphology and do not occur regularly in German, e. [sent-175, score-0.809]
</p><p>54 To this end, –  –  –  –  V  –  –  we constructed a development set comprised of a sample of 1,000 derivational families induced using our rules. [sent-180, score-0.917]
</p><p>55 On this set, we inspected the derivational families for false positives, identified the problematic rules, and identified unused and redundant rules. [sent-181, score-0.924]
</p><p>56 In order to identify the false negatives, we additionally sampled a list of 1,000 lemmas and used string distance measures (cf. [sent-182, score-0.336]
</p><p>57 Table 2 shows the distribution of rules with respect to the derivational processes they implement and the part of speech combinations for the basis and the derived words. [sent-187, score-0.921]
</p><p>58 Suffixation is by far the most frequently used derivation process, and noun-verb derivation is most diverse in terms of derivational processes. [sent-189, score-0.987]
</p><p>59 We also estimated the reliability of derivational rules by analyzing the accuracy of each rule on the development set. [sent-190, score-0.872]
</p><p>60 We manually analyzed the correctness of rule applications for 100 derivational families of different size (counting 2 up to 114 lemmas), and assigned 55, 79, and 24 rules to L3, L2 and L1, respectively. [sent-192, score-1.055]
</p><p>61 2 Data and Preprocessing For an accurate application of nominal derivation rules, we need a lemma list with POS and gender information. [sent-194, score-0.277]
</p><p>62 Second, we deleted verbal lemmas not ending in verb suffixes. [sent-202, score-0.25]
</p><p>63 Third, we removed frequently occurring erroneous comparative forms of adjectives (usually formed by adding -er, like neuer / newer) by checking for the presence of lemmas without -er (neu / new). [sent-203, score-0.25]
</p><p>64 Since most prefixes double as prepositions, the correct lemmas can only be reconstructed by parsing. [sent-206, score-0.293]
</p><p>65 Since SDEWAC, as a web corpus, still contains errors, we only take into account lemmas that occur three times or more in the corpus. [sent-209, score-0.25]
</p><p>66 After preprocessing and filtering, we run the induction of the derivational families as explained in Section 3 to obtain the DERIVBASE resource. [sent-211, score-0.876]
</p><p>67 We induced a total of 239,680 derivational families from this data, with 17,799 non-singletons and 221,881 sin-  gletons (most of them due to compound nouns). [sent-215, score-0.917]
</p><p>68 11,039 of the families consist of two lemmas, while the biggest contains 116 lemmas (an overgenerated family). [sent-216, score-0.433]
</p><p>69 1 contains only 82,676 lemmas in 13,368 non-singleton clusters and 38,604 singletons. [sent-223, score-0.287]
</p><p>70 1 Baselines  We use two baselines against which we compare the induced derivational families: (1) clusters obtained with the German version of Porter’s stemmer (Porter, 1980)3 and (2) clusters obtained using string distance-based clustering. [sent-225, score-0.846]
</p><p>71 To reduce the computational complexity, we performed a preclustering step by recursively partitioning the set of lemmas sharing the same prefix into partitions of manageable size (1000 lemmas). [sent-235, score-0.283]
</p><p>72 Initially, we set the number of clusters to be roughly equal to the number of induced derivational families. [sent-236, score-0.771]
</p><p>73 org We obtain the gold standard for this evaluation by sampling lemmas from the lemma list. [sent-247, score-0.336]
</p><p>74 With random sampling, the evaluation would be unrealistic because a vast majority of pairs would be derivationally unrelated and count as true negatives in our analysis. [sent-248, score-0.223]
</p><p>75 Moreover, in order to reliably estimate the overall precision of the obtained derivational families, we need to evaluate on pairs sampled from these families. [sent-249, score-0.793]
</p><p>76 On the other hand, in order to assess recall, we need to sample from pairs that are not included in our derivational families. [sent-250, score-0.738]
</p><p>77 In both cases, pairs (l1, l2) are sampled in two steps: first a lemma l1  is drawn from a non-singleton family, then the second lemma l2 is drawn from the derivational family of l1 (P-sample) or the set of lemmas possibly related to l1 (R-sample). [sent-252, score-1.203]
</p><p>78 The set of possibly related lemmas is a union of the derivational family of l1, the clusters of l1obtained with the baseline methods, and k lemmas most similar to l1 according to the two string distance measures. [sent-253, score-1.311]
</p><p>79 1), which showed that k = 7 retrieves about 92% of the related lemmas retrieved for k = 20 with a much smaller number of true negatives. [sent-257, score-0.25]
</p><p>80 However, the more 4Ambiguous lemmas are categorized as positive (R or M) if there is a matching sense. [sent-268, score-0.25]
</p><p>81 The separation between R and M gives a deeper insight into the semantics of the derivational families. [sent-274, score-0.693]
</p><p>82 For the baselines, precision was also computed on the R-sample  (computing it on P-sample, which is obtained from the induced derivational families, would severely underestimate the number of false positives). [sent-305, score-0.837]
</p><p>83 DERIVBASE reaches 83% precision when using all rules and 93% precision when using only highly reliable rules. [sent-307, score-0.269]
</p><p>84 We cross-classified our rules according to high/low accuracy and high/low  coverage based on the pairs in the P-sample. [sent-328, score-0.212]
</p><p>85 We only considered directly derivationally related (→D) pairs and defined “high accuracy” and “high coverage” as all rules above the 25th percentile in terms of accuracy and coverage, respectively. [sent-329, score-0.256]
</p><p>86 The recall is lowest for V-V derivations, suggesting that the derivational phenomena for this POS combination are not yet covered satisfactorily. [sent-336, score-0.737]
</p><p>87 2 Error analysis Table 8 shows the frequencies of true positives and false positives on the P-sample and false negatives on the R-sample for each annotated category. [sent-338, score-0.262]
</p><p>88 In both pairs, the two lemmas share a common semantic concept i. [sent-351, score-0.25]
</p><p>89 Among the M true positives, we observe prefixation derivations in 66% of the cases, often involving prefixation at both lemmas, e. [sent-354, score-0.485]
</p><p>90 About 20% out of these unrelated lemma pairs is due to derivations between proper nouns (PNs) and common nouns. [sent-372, score-0.318]
</p><p>91 They cannot be blamed on our derivational model, but of course form part of the output. [sent-379, score-0.693]
</p><p>92 Errors of this type are due to missing derivation rules, erroneous rules that leave some lemmas undiscovered, or the absence of lem-  mas in the corpus required for transitive closure. [sent-381, score-0.555]
</p><p>93 About half of these pairs result from a lack of prefixation rules mainly affecting verbs with a wide variety of prefixes (zu-, um-, etc. [sent-383, score-0.419]
</p><p>94 Apart from the lack of prefixation coverage and a few other, rather infrequent rules, we did not find any substantial deficits. [sent-389, score-0.242]
</p><p>95 We collected derivational families for over 280,000 lemmas with high accuracy as well as solid coverage. [sent-395, score-1.126]
</p><p>96 5 Our approach for compiling a derivational resource is not restricted to German. [sent-397, score-0.727]
</p><p>97 Its main requirements are a large list of lemmas for the language (optionally with further morphological features) and linguistic literature on morphological patterns. [sent-399, score-0.37]
</p><p>98 Finally, we plan to employ distributional semantics methods (Turney and Pantel, 2010) to help remove semantically unrelated pairs as well as distinguish automatically between only morphologically (M) or both morphologically and semantically (R) related pairs. [sent-404, score-0.246]
</p><p>99 Last, but not least, this allows us to group derivation rules according to their semantic properties. [sent-405, score-0.275]

However, they are also sparse, with resulting reliability and coverage problems. We address this problem by derivational smoothing, which uses knowledge about derivationally related words (oldish → old) to improve semantic similarity est→imates. We develop a set of derivational smoothing methods and evaluate them on two lexical semantics tasks in German.

<p>Author: Angeliki Lazaridou ; Marco Marelli ; Roberto Zamparelli ; Marco Baroni</p><p>Abstract: Speakers of a language can construct an unlimited number of new words through morphological derivation. This is a major cause of data sparseness for corpus-based approaches to lexical semantics, such as distributional semantic models of word meaning. We adapt compositional methods originally developed for phrases to the task of deriving the distributional meaning of morphologically complex words from their parts. Semantic representations constructed in this way beat a strong baseline and can be of higher quality than representations directly constructed from corpus data. Our results constitute a novel evaluation of the proposed composition methods, in which the full additive model achieves the best performance, and demonstrate the usefulness of a compositional morphology component in distributional semantics.</p><p>4 0.10895385 <a title="102-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Robust_multilingual_statistical_morphological_generation_models.html">303 acl-2013-Robust multilingual statistical morphological generation models</a></p>

Our system uses a trainable classifier to predict “edit scripts” that are then used to transform lemmas into inflected word forms. Suffixes of lemmas are included as features to achieve robustness. We evaluate our system on 6 languages with a varying degree of morphological richness. The results show that the system is able to learn most morphological phenomena and generalize to unseen inputs, producing significantly better results than a dictionarybased baseline.</p><p>5 0.095858611 <a title="102-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Psycholinguistically_Motivated_Computational_Models_on_the_Organization_and_Processing_of_Morphologically_Complex_Words.html">286 acl-2013-Psycholinguistically Motivated Computational Models on the Organization and Processing of Morphologically Complex Words</a></p>
<p>Author: Tirthankar Dasgupta</p><p>Abstract: In this work we present psycholinguistically motivated computational models for the organization and processing of Bangla morphologically complex words in the mental lexicon. Our goal is to identify whether morphologically complex words are stored as a whole or are they organized along the morphological line. For this, we have conducted a series of psycholinguistic experiments to build up hypothesis on the possible organizational structure of the mental lexicon. Next, we develop computational models based on the collected dataset. We observed that derivationally suffixed Bangla words are in general decomposed during processing and compositionality between the stem . and the suffix plays an important role in the decomposition process. We observed the same phenomena for Bangla verb sequences where experiments showed noncompositional verb sequences are in general stored as a whole in the ML and low traces of compositional verbs are found in the mental lexicon. 1 IInnttrroodduuccttiioonn Mental lexicon is the representation of the words in the human mind and their associations that help fast retrieval and comprehension (Aitchison, 1987). Words are known to be associated with each other in terms of, orthography, phonology, morphology and semantics. However, the precise nature of these relations is unknown. An important issue that has been a subject of study for a long time is to identify the fundamental units in terms of which the mental lexicon is i itkgp .ernet . in organized. That is, whether lexical representations in the mental lexicon are word based or are they organized along morphological lines. For example, whether a word such as “unimaginable” is stored in the mental lexicon as a whole word or do we break it up “un-” , “imagine” and “able”, understand the meaning of each of these constituent and then recombine the units to comprehend the whole word. Such questions are typically answered by designing appropriate priming experiments (Marslen-Wilson et al., 1994) or other lexical decision tasks. The reaction time of the subjects for recognizing various lexical items under appropriate conditions reveals important facts about their organization in the brain. (See Sec. 2 for models of morphological organization and access and related experiments). A clear understanding of the structure and the processing mechanism of the mental lexicon will further our knowledge of how the human brain processes language. Further, these linguistically important and interesting questions are also highly significant for computational linguistics (CL) and natural language processing (NLP) applications. Their computational significance arises from the issue of their storage in lexical resources like WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and raises the questions like, how to store morphologically complex words, in a lexical resource like WordNet keeping in mind the storage and access efficiency. There is a rich literature on organization and lexical access of morphologically complex words where experiments have been conducted mainly for derivational suffixed words of English, Hebrew, Italian, French, Dutch, and few other languages (Marslen-Wilson et al., 2008; Frost et al., 1997; Grainger, et al., 1991 ; Drews and Zwitserlood, 1995). However, we do not know of any such investigations for Indian languages, which 123 Sofia, BuPrlgoacreiead, iAngusgu osft 4h-e9 A 2C01L3 S.tu ?c d2en0t1 3Re Ases aorc hiat Wio nrk fsohro Cp,om papguesta 1ti2o3n–a1l2 L9in,guistics are morphologically richer than many of their Indo-European cousins. Moreover, Indian languages show some distinct phenomena like, compound and composite verbs for which no such investigations have been conducted yet. On the other hand, experiments indicate that mental representation and processing of morphologically complex words are not quite language independent (Taft, 2004). Therefore, the findings from experiments in one language cannot be generalized to all languages making it important to conduct similar experimentations in other languages. This work aims to design cognitively motivated computational models that can explain the organization and processing of Bangla morphologically complex words in the mental lexicon. Presently we will concentrate on the following two aspects:   OOrrggaanniizzaattiioonn aanndd pprroocceessssiinngg ooff BBaannggllaa PPo o l yy-mmoorrpphheemmiicc wwoorrddss:: our objective here is to determine whether the mental lexicon decomposes morphologically complex words into its constituent morphemes or does it represent the unanalyzed surface form of a word. OOrrggaanniizzaattiioonn aanndd pprroocceessssiinngg ooff BBaannggllaa ccoomm-ppoouunndd vveerrbbss ((CCVV)) :: compound verbs are the subject of much debate in linguistic theory. No consensus has been reached yet with respect to the issue that whether to consider them as unitary lexical units or are they syntactically assembled combinations of two independent lexical units. As linguistic arguments have so far not led to a consensus, we here use cognitive experiments to probe the brain signatures of verb-verb combinations and propose cognitive as well as computational models regarding the possible organization and processing of Bangla CVs in the mental lexicon (ML). With respect to this, we apply the different priming and other lexical decision experiments, described in literature (Marslen-Wilson et al., 1994; Bentin, S. and Feldman, 1990) specifically for derivationally suffixed polymorphemic words and compound verbs of Bangla. Our cross-modal and masked priming experiment on Bangla derivationally suffixed words shows that morphological relatedness between lexical items triggers a significant priming effect, even when the forms are phonologically/orthographically unrelated. These observations are similar to those reported for English and indicate that derivationally suffixed words in Bangla are in general accessed through decomposition of the word into its constituent morphemes. Further, based on the experimental data we have developed a series of computational models that can be used to predict the decomposition of Bangla polymorphemic words. Our evaluation result shows that decom- position of a polymorphemic word depends on several factors like, frequency, productivity of the suffix and the compositionality between the stem and the suffix. The organization of the paper is as follows: Sec. 2 presents related works; Sec. 3 describes experiment design and procedure; Sec. 4 presents the processing of CVs; and finally, Sec. 5 concludes the paper by presenting the future direction of the work. 2 RReellaatteedd WWoorrkkss 2. . 11 RReepprreesseennttaattiioonn ooff ppoollyymmoorrpphheemmiicc wwoorrddss Over the last few decades many studies have attempted to understand the representation and processing of morphologically complex words in the brain for various languages. Most of the studies are designed to support one of the two mutually exclusive paradigms: the full-listing and the morphemic model. The full-listing model claims that polymorphic words are represented as a whole in the human mental lexicon (Bradley, 1980; Butterworth, 1983). On the other hand, morphemic model argues that morphologically complex words are decomposed and represented in terms of the smaller morphemic units. The affixes are stripped away from the root form, which in turn are used to access the mental lexicon (Taft and Forster, 1975; Taft, 1981 ; MacKay, 1978). Intermediate to these two paradigms is the partial decomposition model that argues that different types of morphological forms are processed separately. For instance, the derived morphological forms are believed to be represented as a whole, whereas the representation of the inflected forms follows the morphemic model (Caramazza et al., 1988). Traditionally, priming experiments have been used to study the effects of morphology in language processing. Priming is a process that results in increase in speed or accuracy of response to a stimulus, called the target, based on the occurrence of a prior exposure of another stimulus, called the prime (Tulving et al., 1982). Here, subjects are exposed to a prime word for a short duration, and are subsequently shown a target word. The prime and target words may be morphologically, phonologically or semantically re124 lated. An analysis of the effect of the reaction time of subjects reveals the actual organization and representation of the lexicon at the relevant level. See Pulvermüller (2002) for a detailed account of such phenomena. It has been argued that frequency of a word influences the speed of lexical processing and thus, can serve as a diagnostic tool to observe the nature and organization of lexical representations. (Taft, 1975) with his experiment on English inflected words, argued that lexical decision responses of polymorphemic words depends upon the base word frequency. Similar observation for surface word frequency was also observed by (Bertram et al., 2000;Bradley, 1980;Burani et al., 1987;Burani et al., 1984;Schreuder et al., 1997; Taft 1975;Taft, 2004) where it has been claimed that words having low surface frequency tends to decompose. Later, Baayen(2000) proposed the dual processing race model that proposes that a specific morphologically complex form is accessed via its parts if the frequency of that word is above a certain threshold of frequency, then the direct route will win, and the word will be accessed as a whole. If it is below that same threshold of frequency, the parsing route will win, and the word will be accessed via its parts. 2. . 22 RReepprreesseennttaattiioonn ooff CCoommppoouunndd A compound verb (CV) consists of two verbs (V1 and V2) acting as and expresses a single expression For example, in the sentence VVeerrbbss a sequence of a single verb of meaning. রুটিগুল ো খেল খেল ো (/ruTigulo kheYe phela/) ―bread-plural-the eat and drop-pres. Imp‖ ―Eat the breads‖ the verb sequence “খেল খেল ো (eat drop)” is an example of CV. Compound verbs are a special phenomena that are abundantly found in IndoEuropean languages like Indian languages. A plethora of works has been done to provide linguistic explanations on the formation of such word, yet none so far has led to any consensus. Hook (1981) considers the second verb V2 as an aspectual complex comparable to the auxiliaries. Butt (1993) argues CV formations in Hindi and Urdu are either morphological or syntactical and their formation take place at the argument struc- ture. Bashir (1993) tried to construct a semantic analysis based on “prepared” and “unprepared mind”. Similar findings have been proposed by Pandharipande (1993) that points out V1 and V2 are paired on the basis of their semantic compatibility, which is subject to syntactic constraints. Paul (2004) tried to represent Bangla CVs in terms of HPSG formalism. She proposes that the selection of a V2 by a V1 is determined at the semantic level because the two verbs will unify if and only if they are semantically compatible. Since none of the linguistic formalism could satisfactorily explain the unique phenomena of CV formation, we here for the first time drew our attention towards psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic studies to model the processing of verb-verb combinations in the ML and compare these responses with that of the existing models. 3 TThhee PPrrooppoosseedd AApppprrooaacchheess 3. . 11 TThhee ppssyycchhoolliinngguuiissttiicc eexxppeerriimmeennttss We apply two different priming experiments namely, the cross modal priming and masked priming experiment discussed in (Forster and Davis, 1984; Rastle et al., 2000;Marslen-Wilson et al., 1994; Marslen-Wilson et al., 2008) for Bangla morphologically complex words. Here, the prime is morphologically derived form of the target presented auditorily (for cross modal priming) or visually (for masked priming). The subjects were asked to make a lexical decision whether the given target is a valid word in that language. The same target word is again probed but with a different audio or visual probe called the control word. The control shows no relationship with the target. For example, baYaska (aged) and baYasa (age) is a prime-target pair, for which the corresponding control-target pair could be naYana (eye) and baYasa (age). Similar to (Marslen-Wilson et al., 2008) the masked priming has been conducted for three different SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony), 48ms, 72ms and 120ms. The SOA is measured as the amount of time between the start the first stimulus till the start of the next stimulus.

There were 500 prime-target and controltarget pairs classified into five classes. Depending on the class, the prime is related to the target 125 either in terms of morphology, semantics, orthography and/or Phonology (See Table 1). The experiments were conducted on 24 highly educated native Bangla speakers. Nineteen of them have a graduate degree and five hold a post graduate degree. The age of the subjects varies between 22 to 35 years. RReessuullttss:: The RTs with extreme values and incorrect decisions were excluded from the data. The data has been analyzed using two ways ANOVA with three factors: priming (prime and control), conditions (five classes) and prime durations (three different SOA). We observe strong priming effects (p<0.05) when the target word is morphologically derived and has a recognizable suffix, semantically and orthographically related with respect to the prime; no priming effects are observed when the prime and target words are orthographically related but share no morphological or semantic relationship; although not statistically significant (p>0.07), but weak priming is observed for prime target pairs that are only semantically related. We see no significant difference between the prime and control RTs for other classes. We also looked at the RTs for each of the 500 target words. We observe that maximum priming occurs for words in [M+S+O+](69%), some priming is evident in [M+S+O-](51%) and [M'+S-O+](48%), but for most of the words in [M-S+O-](86%) and [M-S-O+](92%) no priming effect was observed. 3. . 22 FFrreeqquueennccyy DDiissttrriibbuuttiioonn MMooddeellss ooff MMoo rrpphhoo-llooggiiccaall PPrroocceessssiinngg From the above results we saw that not all polymorphemic words tend to decompose during processing, thus we need to further investigate the processing phenomena of Bangla derived words. One notable means is to identify whether the stem or suffix frequency is involved in the processing stage of that word. For this, we apply different frequency based models to the Bangla polymorphemic words and try to evaluate their performance by comparing their predicted results with the result obtained through the priming experiment. MMooddeell --11:: BBaassee aanndd SSuurrffaaccee wwoorrdd ffrreeqquueennccyy ee ff-ffeecctt -- It states that the probability of decomposition of a Bangla polymorphemic word depends upon the frequency of its base word. Thus, if the stem frequency of a polymorphemic word crosses a given threshold value, then the word will decomposed into its constituent morpheme. Similar claim has been made for surface word frequency model where decomposition depends upon the frequency of the surface word itself. We have evaluated both the models with the 500 words used in the priming experiments discussed above. We have achieved an accuracy of 62% and 49% respectively for base and surface word frequency models. MMooddeell --22:: CCoommbbiinniinngg tthhee bbaassee aanndd ssuurrffaaccee wwoorrdd ffrreeq quueennccyy -- In a pursuit towards an extended model, we combine model 1 and 2 together. We took the log frequencies of both the base and the derived words and plotted the best-fit regression curve over the given dataset. The evaluation of this model over the same set of 500 target words returns an accuracy of 68% which is better than the base and surface word frequency models. However, the proposed model still fails to predict processing of around 32% of words. This led us to further enhance the model. For this, we analyze the role of suffixes in morphological processing. MMooddeell -- 33:: DDeeggrreeee ooff AAffffiixxaattiioonn aanndd SSuuffffiixx PPrroodd-uuccttiivviittyy:: we examine whether the regression analysis between base and derived frequency of Bangla words varies between suffixes and how these variations affect morphological decomposition. With respect to this, we try to compute the degree of affixation between the suffix and the base word. For this, we perform regression analysis on sixteen different Bangla suffixes with varying degree of type and token frequencies. For each suffix, we choose 100 different derived words. We observe that those suffixes having high value of intercept are forming derived words whose base frequencies are substantially high as compared to their derived forms. Moreover we also observe that high intercept value for a given suffix indicates higher inclination towards decomposition. Next, we try to analyze the role of suffix type/token ratio and compare them with the base/derived frequency ratio model. This has been done by regression analysis between the suffix type-token ratios with the base-surface frequency ratio. We further tried to observe the role of suffix productivity in morphological processing. For this, we computed the three components of productivity P, P* and V as discussed in (Hay and Plag, 2004). P is the “conditioned degree of productivity” and is the probability that we are encountering a word with an affix and it is representing a new type. P* is the “hapaxedconditioned degree of productivity”. It expresses the probability that when an entirely new word is 126 encountered it will contain the suffix. V is the “type frequency”. Finally, we computed the productivity of a suffix through its P, P* and V values. We found that decomposition of Bangla polymorphemic word is directly proportional to the productivity of the suffix. Therefore, words that are composed of productive suffixes (P value ranges between 0.6 and 0.9) like “-oYAlA”, “-giri”, “-tba” and “-panA” are highly decomposable than low productive suffixes like “-Ani”, “-lA”, “-k”, and “-tama”. The evaluation of the proposed model returns an accuracy of 76% which comes to be 8% better than the preceding models. CCoommbbiinniinngg MMooddeell --22 aanndd MMooddeell -- 33:: One important observation that can be made from the above results is that, model-3 performs best in determining the true negative values. It also possesses a high recall value of (85%) but having a low precision of (50%). In other words, the model can predict those words for which decomposition will not take place. On the other hand, results of Model-2 posses a high precision of 70%. Thus, we argue that combining the above two models can better predict the decomposition of Bangla polymorphemic words. Hence, we combine the two models together and finally achieved an overall accuracy of 80% with a precision of 87% and a recall of 78%. This surpasses the performance of the other models discussed earlier. However, around 22% of the test words were wrongly classified which the model fails to justify. Thus, a more rigorous set of experiments and data analysis are required to predict access mechanisms of such Bangla polymorphemic words. 3. . 33 SStteemm- -SSuuffffiixx CCoommppoossiittiioonnaalliittyy Compositionality refers to the fact that meaning of a complex expression is inferred from the meaning of its constituents. Therefore, the cost of retrieving a word from the secondary memory is directly proportional to the cost of retrieving the individual parts (i.e the stem and the suffix). Thus, following the work of (Milin et al., 2009) we define the compositionality of a morphologically complex word (We) as: C(We)=α 1H(We)+α α2H(e)+α α3H(W|e)+ α4H(e|W) Where, H(x) is entropy of an expression x, H(W|e) is the conditional entropy between the stem W and suffix e and is the proportionality factor whose value is computed through regression analysis. Next, we tried to compute the compositionality of the stem and suffixes in terms of relative entropy D(W||e) and Point wise mutual information (PMI). The relative entropy is the measure of the distance between the probability distribution of the stem W and the suffix e. The PMI measures the amount of information that one random variable (the stem) contains about the other (the suffix). We have compared the above three techniques with the actual reaction time data collected through the priming and lexical decision experiment. We observed that all the three information theoretic models perform much better than the frequency based models discussed in the earlier section, for predicting the decomposability of Bangla polymorphemic words. However, we think it is still premature to claim anything concrete at this stage of our work. We believe much more rigorous experiments are needed to be per- formed in order to validate our proposed models. Further, the present paper does not consider factors related to age of acquisition, and word familiarity effects that plays important role in the processing of morphologically complex words. Moreover, it is also very interesting to see how stacking of multiple suffixes in a word are processed by the human brain. 44 OOrrggaanniizzaattiioonn aanndd PPrroocceessssiinngg ooff CCoomm-ppoouunndd VVeerrbbss iinn tthhee MMeennttaall LLeexxiiccoonn Compound verbs, as discussed above, are special type of verb sequences consisting of two or more verbs acting as a single verb and express a single expression of meaning. The verb V1 is known as pole and V2 is called as vector. For example, “ওঠে পড়া ” (getting up) is a compound verb where individual words do not entirely reflects the meaning of the whole expression. However, not all V1+V2 combinations are CVs. For example, expressions like, “নিঠে য়াও ”(take and then go) and “ নিঠে আঠ ়া” (return back) are the examples of verb sequences where meaning of the whole expression can be derived from the mean- ing of the individual component and thus, these verb sequences are not considered as CV. The key question linguists are trying to identify for a long time and debating a lot is whether to consider CVs as a single lexical units or consider them as two separate units. Since linguistic rules fails to explain the process, we for the first time tried to perform cognitive experiments to understand the organization and processing of such verb sequences in the human mind. A clear understanding about these phenomena may help us to classify or extract actual CVs from other verb 127 sequences. In order to do so, presently we have applied three different techniques to collect user data. In the first technique, we annotated 4500 V1+V2 sequences, along with their example sentences, using a group of three linguists (the expert subjects). We asked the experts to classify the verb sequences into three classes namely, CV, not a CV and not sure. Each linguist has received 2000 verb pairs along with their respective example sentences. Out of this, 1500 verb sequences are unique to each of them and rest 500 are overlapping. We measure the inter annotator agreement using the Fleiss Kappa (Fleiss et al., 1981) measure (κ) where the agreement lies around 0.79. Next, out of the 500 common verb sequences that were annotated by all the three linguists, we randomly choose 300 V1+V2 pairs and presented them to 36 native Bangla speakers. We ask each subjects to give a compositionality score of each verb sequences under 1-10 point scale, 10 being highly compositional and 1 for noncompositional. We found an agreement of κ=0.69 among the subjects. We also observe a continuum of compositionality score among the verb sequences. This reflects that it is difficult to classify Bangla verb sequences discretely into the classes of CV and not a CV. We then, compare the compositionality score with that of the expert user’s annotation. We found a significant correlation between the expert annotation and the compositionality score. We observe verb sequences that are annotated as CVs (like, খেঠে খিল )কঠে খি ,ওঠে পড ,have got low compositionality score (average score ranges between 1-4) on the other hand high compositional values are in general tagged as not a cv (নিঠে য়া (come and get), নিঠে আে (return back), তুঠল খেঠেনি (kept), গনিঠে পিল (roll on floor)). This reflects that verb sequences which are not CV shows high degree of compositionality. In other words non CV verbs can directly interpret from their constituent verbs. This leads us to the possibility that compositional verb sequences requires individual verbs to be recognized separately and thus the time to recognize such expressions must be greater than the non-compositional verbs which maps to a single expression of meaning. In order to validate such claim we perform a lexical decision experiment using 32 native Bangla speakers with 92 different verb sequences. We followed the same experimental procedure as discussed in (Taft, 2004) for English polymorphemic words. However, rather than derived words, the subjects were shown a verb sequence and asked whether they recognize them as a valid combination. The reaction time (RT) of each subject is recorded. Our preliminarily observation from the RT analysis shows that as per our claim, RT of verb sequences having high compositionality value is significantly higher than the RTs for low or noncompositional verbs. This proves our hypothesis that Bangla compound verbs that show less compositionality are stored as a hole in the mental lexicon and thus follows the full-listing model whereas compositional verb phrases are individually parsed. However, we do believe that our experiment is composed of a very small set of data and it is premature to conclude anything concrete based only on the current experimental results. 5 FFuuttuurree DDiirreeccttiioonnss In the next phase of our work we will focus on the following aspects of Bangla morphologically complex words: TThhee WWoorrdd FFaammiilliiaarriittyy EEffffeecctt:: Here, our aim is to study the role of familiarity of a word during its processing.

Even for German, a rather resourcerich language, there is a lack of largecoverage derivational knowledge. This paper describes a rule-based framework for inducing derivational families (i.e., clusters of lemmas in derivational relationships) and its application to create a highcoverage German resource, DERIVBASE, mapping over 280k lemmas into more than 17k non-singleton clusters. We focus on the rule component and a qualitative and quantitative evaluation. Our approach achieves up to 93% precision and 71% recall.

<p>Author: Tirthankar Dasgupta</p><p>Abstract: In this work we present psycholinguistically motivated computational models for the organization and processing of Bangla morphologically complex words in the mental lexicon. Our goal is to identify whether morphologically complex words are stored as a whole or are they organized along the morphological line. For this, we have conducted a series of psycholinguistic experiments to build up hypothesis on the possible organizational structure of the mental lexicon. Next, we develop computational models based on the collected dataset. We observed that derivationally suffixed Bangla words are in general decomposed during processing and compositionality between the stem . and the suffix plays an important role in the decomposition process. We observed the same phenomena for Bangla verb sequences where experiments showed noncompositional verb sequences are in general stored as a whole in the ML and low traces of compositional verbs are found in the mental lexicon. 1 IInnttrroodduuccttiioonn Mental lexicon is the representation of the words in the human mind and their associations that help fast retrieval and comprehension (Aitchison, 1987). Words are known to be associated with each other in terms of, orthography, phonology, morphology and semantics. However, the precise nature of these relations is unknown. An important issue that has been a subject of study for a long time is to identify the fundamental units in terms of which the mental lexicon is i itkgp .ernet . in organized. That is, whether lexical representations in the mental lexicon are word based or are they organized along morphological lines. For example, whether a word such as “unimaginable” is stored in the mental lexicon as a whole word or do we break it up “un-” , “imagine” and “able”, understand the meaning of each of these constituent and then recombine the units to comprehend the whole word. Such questions are typically answered by designing appropriate priming experiments (Marslen-Wilson et al., 1994) or other lexical decision tasks. The reaction time of the subjects for recognizing various lexical items under appropriate conditions reveals important facts about their organization in the brain. (See Sec. 2 for models of morphological organization and access and related experiments). A clear understanding of the structure and the processing mechanism of the mental lexicon will further our knowledge of how the human brain processes language. Further, these linguistically important and interesting questions are also highly significant for computational linguistics (CL) and natural language processing (NLP) applications. Their computational significance arises from the issue of their storage in lexical resources like WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and raises the questions like, how to store morphologically complex words, in a lexical resource like WordNet keeping in mind the storage and access efficiency. There is a rich literature on organization and lexical access of morphologically complex words where experiments have been conducted mainly for derivational suffixed words of English, Hebrew, Italian, French, Dutch, and few other languages (Marslen-Wilson et al., 2008; Frost et al., 1997; Grainger, et al., 1991 ; Drews and Zwitserlood, 1995). However, we do not know of any such investigations for Indian languages, which 123 Sofia, BuPrlgoacreiead, iAngusgu osft 4h-e9 A 2C01L3 S.tu ?c d2en0t1 3Re Ases aorc hiat Wio nrk fsohro Cp,om papguesta 1ti2o3n–a1l2 L9in,guistics are morphologically richer than many of their Indo-European cousins. Moreover, Indian languages show some distinct phenomena like, compound and composite verbs for which no such investigations have been conducted yet. On the other hand, experiments indicate that mental representation and processing of morphologically complex words are not quite language independent (Taft, 2004). Therefore, the findings from experiments in one language cannot be generalized to all languages making it important to conduct similar experimentations in other languages. This work aims to design cognitively motivated computational models that can explain the organization and processing of Bangla morphologically complex words in the mental lexicon. Presently we will concentrate on the following two aspects:   OOrrggaanniizzaattiioonn aanndd pprroocceessssiinngg ooff BBaannggllaa PPo o l yy-mmoorrpphheemmiicc wwoorrddss:: our objective here is to determine whether the mental lexicon decomposes morphologically complex words into its constituent morphemes or does it represent the unanalyzed surface form of a word. OOrrggaanniizzaattiioonn aanndd pprroocceessssiinngg ooff BBaannggllaa ccoomm-ppoouunndd vveerrbbss ((CCVV)) :: compound verbs are the subject of much debate in linguistic theory. No consensus has been reached yet with respect to the issue that whether to consider them as unitary lexical units or are they syntactically assembled combinations of two independent lexical units. As linguistic arguments have so far not led to a consensus, we here use cognitive experiments to probe the brain signatures of verb-verb combinations and propose cognitive as well as computational models regarding the possible organization and processing of Bangla CVs in the mental lexicon (ML). With respect to this, we apply the different priming and other lexical decision experiments, described in literature (Marslen-Wilson et al., 1994; Bentin, S. and Feldman, 1990) specifically for derivationally suffixed polymorphemic words and compound verbs of Bangla. Our cross-modal and masked priming experiment on Bangla derivationally suffixed words shows that morphological relatedness between lexical items triggers a significant priming effect, even when the forms are phonologically/orthographically unrelated. These observations are similar to those reported for English and indicate that derivationally suffixed words in Bangla are in general accessed through decomposition of the word into its constituent morphemes. Further, based on the experimental data we have developed a series of computational models that can be used to predict the decomposition of Bangla polymorphemic words. Our evaluation result shows that decom- position of a polymorphemic word depends on several factors like, frequency, productivity of the suffix and the compositionality between the stem and the suffix. The organization of the paper is as follows: Sec. 2 presents related works; Sec. 3 describes experiment design and procedure; Sec. 4 presents the processing of CVs; and finally, Sec. 5 concludes the paper by presenting the future direction of the work. 2 RReellaatteedd WWoorrkkss 2. . 11 RReepprreesseennttaattiioonn ooff ppoollyymmoorrpphheemmiicc wwoorrddss Over the last few decades many studies have attempted to understand the representation and processing of morphologically complex words in the brain for various languages. Most of the studies are designed to support one of the two mutually exclusive paradigms: the full-listing and the morphemic model. The full-listing model claims that polymorphic words are represented as a whole in the human mental lexicon (Bradley, 1980; Butterworth, 1983). On the other hand, morphemic model argues that morphologically complex words are decomposed and represented in terms of the smaller morphemic units. The affixes are stripped away from the root form, which in turn are used to access the mental lexicon (Taft and Forster, 1975; Taft, 1981 ; MacKay, 1978). Intermediate to these two paradigms is the partial decomposition model that argues that different types of morphological forms are processed separately. For instance, the derived morphological forms are believed to be represented as a whole, whereas the representation of the inflected forms follows the morphemic model (Caramazza et al., 1988). Traditionally, priming experiments have been used to study the effects of morphology in language processing. Priming is a process that results in increase in speed or accuracy of response to a stimulus, called the target, based on the occurrence of a prior exposure of another stimulus, called the prime (Tulving et al., 1982). Here, subjects are exposed to a prime word for a short duration, and are subsequently shown a target word. The prime and target words may be morphologically, phonologically or semantically re124 lated. An analysis of the effect of the reaction time of subjects reveals the actual organization and representation of the lexicon at the relevant level. See Pulvermüller (2002) for a detailed account of such phenomena. It has been argued that frequency of a word influences the speed of lexical processing and thus, can serve as a diagnostic tool to observe the nature and organization of lexical representations. (Taft, 1975) with his experiment on English inflected words, argued that lexical decision responses of polymorphemic words depends upon the base word frequency. Similar observation for surface word frequency was also observed by (Bertram et al., 2000;Bradley, 1980;Burani et al., 1987;Burani et al., 1984;Schreuder et al., 1997; Taft 1975;Taft, 2004) where it has been claimed that words having low surface frequency tends to decompose. Later, Baayen(2000) proposed the dual processing race model that proposes that a specific morphologically complex form is accessed via its parts if the frequency of that word is above a certain threshold of frequency, then the direct route will win, and the word will be accessed as a whole. If it is below that same threshold of frequency, the parsing route will win, and the word will be accessed via its parts. 2. . 22 RReepprreesseennttaattiioonn ooff CCoommppoouunndd A compound verb (CV) consists of two verbs (V1 and V2) acting as and expresses a single expression For example, in the sentence VVeerrbbss a sequence of a single verb of meaning. রুটিগুল ো খেল খেল ো (/ruTigulo kheYe phela/) ―bread-plural-the eat and drop-pres. Imp‖ ―Eat the breads‖ the verb sequence “খেল খেল ো (eat drop)” is an example of CV. Compound verbs are a special phenomena that are abundantly found in IndoEuropean languages like Indian languages. A plethora of works has been done to provide linguistic explanations on the formation of such word, yet none so far has led to any consensus. Hook (1981) considers the second verb V2 as an aspectual complex comparable to the auxiliaries. Butt (1993) argues CV formations in Hindi and Urdu are either morphological or syntactical and their formation take place at the argument struc- ture. Bashir (1993) tried to construct a semantic analysis based on “prepared” and “unprepared mind”. Similar findings have been proposed by Pandharipande (1993) that points out V1 and V2 are paired on the basis of their semantic compatibility, which is subject to syntactic constraints. Paul (2004) tried to represent Bangla CVs in terms of HPSG formalism. She proposes that the selection of a V2 by a V1 is determined at the semantic level because the two verbs will unify if and only if they are semantically compatible. Since none of the linguistic formalism could satisfactorily explain the unique phenomena of CV formation, we here for the first time drew our attention towards psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic studies to model the processing of verb-verb combinations in the ML and compare these responses with that of the existing models. 3 TThhee PPrrooppoosseedd AApppprrooaacchheess 3. . 11 TThhee ppssyycchhoolliinngguuiissttiicc eexxppeerriimmeennttss We apply two different priming experiments namely, the cross modal priming and masked priming experiment discussed in (Forster and Davis, 1984; Rastle et al., 2000;Marslen-Wilson et al., 1994; Marslen-Wilson et al., 2008) for Bangla morphologically complex words. Here, the prime is morphologically derived form of the target presented auditorily (for cross modal priming) or visually (for masked priming). The subjects were asked to make a lexical decision whether the given target is a valid word in that language. The same target word is again probed but with a different audio or visual probe called the control word. The control shows no relationship with the target. For example, baYaska (aged) and baYasa (age) is a prime-target pair, for which the corresponding control-target pair could be naYana (eye) and baYasa (age). Similar to (Marslen-Wilson et al., 2008) the masked priming has been conducted for three different SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony), 48ms, 72ms and 120ms. The SOA is measured as the amount of time between the start the first stimulus till the start of the next stimulus.

There were 500 prime-target and controltarget pairs classified into five classes. Depending on the class, the prime is related to the target 125 either in terms of morphology, semantics, orthography and/or Phonology (See Table 1). The experiments were conducted on 24 highly educated native Bangla speakers. Nineteen of them have a graduate degree and five hold a post graduate degree. The age of the subjects varies between 22 to 35 years. RReessuullttss:: The RTs with extreme values and incorrect decisions were excluded from the data. The data has been analyzed using two ways ANOVA with three factors: priming (prime and control), conditions (five classes) and prime durations (three different SOA). We observe strong priming effects (p<0.05) when the target word is morphologically derived and has a recognizable suffix, semantically and orthographically related with respect to the prime; no priming effects are observed when the prime and target words are orthographically related but share no morphological or semantic relationship; although not statistically significant (p>0.07), but weak priming is observed for prime target pairs that are only semantically related. We see no significant difference between the prime and control RTs for other classes. We also looked at the RTs for each of the 500 target words. We observe that maximum priming occurs for words in [M+S+O+](69%), some priming is evident in [M+S+O-](51%) and [M'+S-O+](48%), but for most of the words in [M-S+O-](86%) and [M-S-O+](92%) no priming effect was observed. 3. . 22 FFrreeqquueennccyy DDiissttrriibbuuttiioonn MMooddeellss ooff MMoo rrpphhoo-llooggiiccaall PPrroocceessssiinngg From the above results we saw that not all polymorphemic words tend to decompose during processing, thus we need to further investigate the processing phenomena of Bangla derived words. One notable means is to identify whether the stem or suffix frequency is involved in the processing stage of that word. For this, we apply different frequency based models to the Bangla polymorphemic words and try to evaluate their performance by comparing their predicted results with the result obtained through the priming experiment. MMooddeell --11:: BBaassee aanndd SSuurrffaaccee wwoorrdd ffrreeqquueennccyy ee ff-ffeecctt -- It states that the probability of decomposition of a Bangla polymorphemic word depends upon the frequency of its base word. Thus, if the stem frequency of a polymorphemic word crosses a given threshold value, then the word will decomposed into its constituent morpheme. Similar claim has been made for surface word frequency model where decomposition depends upon the frequency of the surface word itself. We have evaluated both the models with the 500 words used in the priming experiments discussed above. We have achieved an accuracy of 62% and 49% respectively for base and surface word frequency models. MMooddeell --22:: CCoommbbiinniinngg tthhee bbaassee aanndd ssuurrffaaccee wwoorrdd ffrreeq quueennccyy -- In a pursuit towards an extended model, we combine model 1 and 2 together. We took the log frequencies of both the base and the derived words and plotted the best-fit regression curve over the given dataset. The evaluation of this model over the same set of 500 target words returns an accuracy of 68% which is better than the base and surface word frequency models. However, the proposed model still fails to predict processing of around 32% of words. This led us to further enhance the model. For this, we analyze the role of suffixes in morphological processing. MMooddeell -- 33:: DDeeggrreeee ooff AAffffiixxaattiioonn aanndd SSuuffffiixx PPrroodd-uuccttiivviittyy:: we examine whether the regression analysis between base and derived frequency of Bangla words varies between suffixes and how these variations affect morphological decomposition. With respect to this, we try to compute the degree of affixation between the suffix and the base word. For this, we perform regression analysis on sixteen different Bangla suffixes with varying degree of type and token frequencies. For each suffix, we choose 100 different derived words. We observe that those suffixes having high value of intercept are forming derived words whose base frequencies are substantially high as compared to their derived forms. Moreover we also observe that high intercept value for a given suffix indicates higher inclination towards decomposition. Next, we try to analyze the role of suffix type/token ratio and compare them with the base/derived frequency ratio model. This has been done by regression analysis between the suffix type-token ratios with the base-surface frequency ratio. We further tried to observe the role of suffix productivity in morphological processing. For this, we computed the three components of productivity P, P* and V as discussed in (Hay and Plag, 2004). P is the “conditioned degree of productivity” and is the probability that we are encountering a word with an affix and it is representing a new type. P* is the “hapaxedconditioned degree of productivity”. It expresses the probability that when an entirely new word is 126 encountered it will contain the suffix. V is the “type frequency”. Finally, we computed the productivity of a suffix through its P, P* and V values. We found that decomposition of Bangla polymorphemic word is directly proportional to the productivity of the suffix. Therefore, words that are composed of productive suffixes (P value ranges between 0.6 and 0.9) like “-oYAlA”, “-giri”, “-tba” and “-panA” are highly decomposable than low productive suffixes like “-Ani”, “-lA”, “-k”, and “-tama”. The evaluation of the proposed model returns an accuracy of 76% which comes to be 8% better than the preceding models. CCoommbbiinniinngg MMooddeell --22 aanndd MMooddeell -- 33:: One important observation that can be made from the above results is that, model-3 performs best in determining the true negative values. It also possesses a high recall value of (85%) but having a low precision of (50%). In other words, the model can predict those words for which decomposition will not take place. On the other hand, results of Model-2 posses a high precision of 70%. Thus, we argue that combining the above two models can better predict the decomposition of Bangla polymorphemic words. Hence, we combine the two models together and finally achieved an overall accuracy of 80% with a precision of 87% and a recall of 78%. This surpasses the performance of the other models discussed earlier. However, around 22% of the test words were wrongly classified which the model fails to justify. Thus, a more rigorous set of experiments and data analysis are required to predict access mechanisms of such Bangla polymorphemic words. 3. . 33 SStteemm- -SSuuffffiixx CCoommppoossiittiioonnaalliittyy Compositionality refers to the fact that meaning of a complex expression is inferred from the meaning of its constituents. Therefore, the cost of retrieving a word from the secondary memory is directly proportional to the cost of retrieving the individual parts (i.e the stem and the suffix). Thus, following the work of (Milin et al., 2009) we define the compositionality of a morphologically complex word (We) as: C(We)=α 1H(We)+α α2H(e)+α α3H(W|e)+ α4H(e|W) Where, H(x) is entropy of an expression x, H(W|e) is the conditional entropy between the stem W and suffix e and is the proportionality factor whose value is computed through regression analysis. Next, we tried to compute the compositionality of the stem and suffixes in terms of relative entropy D(W||e) and Point wise mutual information (PMI). The relative entropy is the measure of the distance between the probability distribution of the stem W and the suffix e. The PMI measures the amount of information that one random variable (the stem) contains about the other (the suffix). We have compared the above three techniques with the actual reaction time data collected through the priming and lexical decision experiment. We observed that all the three information theoretic models perform much better than the frequency based models discussed in the earlier section, for predicting the decomposability of Bangla polymorphemic words. However, we think it is still premature to claim anything concrete at this stage of our work. We believe much more rigorous experiments are needed to be per- formed in order to validate our proposed models. Further, the present paper does not consider factors related to age of acquisition, and word familiarity effects that plays important role in the processing of morphologically complex words. Moreover, it is also very interesting to see how stacking of multiple suffixes in a word are processed by the human brain. 44 OOrrggaanniizzaattiioonn aanndd PPrroocceessssiinngg ooff CCoomm-ppoouunndd VVeerrbbss iinn tthhee MMeennttaall LLeexxiiccoonn Compound verbs, as discussed above, are special type of verb sequences consisting of two or more verbs acting as a single verb and express a single expression of meaning. The verb V1 is known as pole and V2 is called as vector. For example, “ওঠে পড়া ” (getting up) is a compound verb where individual words do not entirely reflects the meaning of the whole expression. However, not all V1+V2 combinations are CVs. For example, expressions like, “নিঠে য়াও ”(take and then go) and “ নিঠে আঠ ়া” (return back) are the examples of verb sequences where meaning of the whole expression can be derived from the mean- ing of the individual component and thus, these verb sequences are not considered as CV. The key question linguists are trying to identify for a long time and debating a lot is whether to consider CVs as a single lexical units or consider them as two separate units. Since linguistic rules fails to explain the process, we for the first time tried to perform cognitive experiments to understand the organization and processing of such verb sequences in the human mind. A clear understanding about these phenomena may help us to classify or extract actual CVs from other verb 127 sequences. In order to do so, presently we have applied three different techniques to collect user data. In the first technique, we annotated 4500 V1+V2 sequences, along with their example sentences, using a group of three linguists (the expert subjects). We asked the experts to classify the verb sequences into three classes namely, CV, not a CV and not sure. Each linguist has received 2000 verb pairs along with their respective example sentences. Out of this, 1500 verb sequences are unique to each of them and rest 500 are overlapping. We measure the inter annotator agreement using the Fleiss Kappa (Fleiss et al., 1981) measure (κ) where the agreement lies around 0.79. Next, out of the 500 common verb sequences that were annotated by all the three linguists, we randomly choose 300 V1+V2 pairs and presented them to 36 native Bangla speakers. We ask each subjects to give a compositionality score of each verb sequences under 1-10 point scale, 10 being highly compositional and 1 for noncompositional. We found an agreement of κ=0.69 among the subjects. We also observe a continuum of compositionality score among the verb sequences. This reflects that it is difficult to classify Bangla verb sequences discretely into the classes of CV and not a CV. We then, compare the compositionality score with that of the expert user’s annotation. We found a significant correlation between the expert annotation and the compositionality score. We observe verb sequences that are annotated as CVs (like, খেঠে খিল )কঠে খি ,ওঠে পড ,have got low compositionality score (average score ranges between 1-4) on the other hand high compositional values are in general tagged as not a cv (নিঠে য়া (come and get), নিঠে আে (return back), তুঠল খেঠেনি (kept), গনিঠে পিল (roll on floor)). This reflects that verb sequences which are not CV shows high degree of compositionality. In other words non CV verbs can directly interpret from their constituent verbs. This leads us to the possibility that compositional verb sequences requires individual verbs to be recognized separately and thus the time to recognize such expressions must be greater than the non-compositional verbs which maps to a single expression of meaning. In order to validate such claim we perform a lexical decision experiment using 32 native Bangla speakers with 92 different verb sequences. We followed the same experimental procedure as discussed in (Taft, 2004) for English polymorphemic words. However, rather than derived words, the subjects were shown a verb sequence and asked whether they recognize them as a valid combination. The reaction time (RT) of each subject is recorded. Our preliminarily observation from the RT analysis shows that as per our claim, RT of verb sequences having high compositionality value is significantly higher than the RTs for low or noncompositional verbs. This proves our hypothesis that Bangla compound verbs that show less compositionality are stored as a hole in the mental lexicon and thus follows the full-listing model whereas compositional verb phrases are individually parsed. However, we do believe that our experiment is composed of a very small set of data and it is premature to conclude anything concrete based only on the current experimental results. 5 FFuuttuurree DDiirreeccttiioonnss In the next phase of our work we will focus on the following aspects of Bangla morphologically complex words: TThhee WWoorrdd FFaammiilliiaarriittyy EEffffeecctt:: Here, our aim is to study the role of familiarity of a word during its processing.

Our system uses a trainable classifier to predict “edit scripts” that are then used to transform lemmas into inflected word forms. Suffixes of lemmas are included as features to achieve robustness. We evaluate our system on 6 languages with a varying degree of morphological richness. The results show that the system is able to learn most morphological phenomena and generalize to unseen inputs, producing significantly better results than a dictionarybased baseline.</p><p>6 0.45092475 <a title="102-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Compositional-ly_Derived_Representations_of_Morphologically_Complex_Words_in_Distributional_Semantics.html">87 acl-2013-Compositional-ly Derived Representations of Morphologically Complex Words in Distributional Semantics</a></p>

<p>Author: Sasa Petrovic ; David Matthews</p><p>Abstract: Humor generation is a very hard problem. It is difficult to say exactly what makes a joke funny, and solving this problem algorithmically is assumed to require deep semantic understanding, as well as cultural and other contextual cues. We depart from previous work that tries to model this knowledge using ad-hoc manually created databases and labeled training examples. Instead we present a model that uses large amounts of unannotated data to generate I like my X like I like my Y, Z jokes, where X, Y, and Z are variables to be filled in. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first fully unsupervised humor generation system. Our model significantly outperforms a competitive baseline and generates funny jokes 16% of the time, compared to 33% for human-generated jokes.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.83338946 <a title="102-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-DErivBase%3A_Inducing_and_Evaluating_a_Derivational_Morphology_Resource_for_German.html">102 acl-2013-DErivBase: Inducing and Evaluating a Derivational Morphology Resource for German</a></p>

Even for German, a rather resourcerich language, there is a lack of largecoverage derivational knowledge. This paper describes a rule-based framework for inducing derivational families (i.e., clusters of lemmas in derivational relationships) and its application to create a highcoverage German resource, DERIVBASE, mapping over 280k lemmas into more than 17k non-singleton clusters. We focus on the rule component and a qualitative and quantitative evaluation. Our approach achieves up to 93% precision and 71% recall. We attribute the high precision to the fact that our rules are based on information from grammar books.</p><p>3 0.82676017 <a title="102-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Grammatical_Error_Correction_Using_Integer_Linear_Programming.html">171 acl-2013-Grammatical Error Correction Using Integer Linear Programming</a></p>

The toolkit focuses in particular on compositional meaning, and implements a number of composition methods that have been proposed in the literature. Furthermore, DISSECT can be useful to researchers and practitioners who need models of word meaning (without composition) as well, as it supports various methods to construct distributional semantic spaces, assessing similarity and even evaluating against benchmarks, that are independent of the composition infrastructure.</p><p>5 0.65352917 <a title="102-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-A_Random_Walk_Approach_to_Selectional_Preferences_Based_on_Preference_Ranking_and_Propagation.html">17 acl-2013-A Random Walk Approach to Selectional Preferences Based on Preference Ranking and Propagation</a></p>

Based on the measure of preferences between predicates and arguments, the model aggregates all the transitions from a given predicate to its nearby predicates, and propagates their argument preferences as the given predicate’s smoothed preferences. Experimental results show that this approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on the pseudo-disambiguation task, and it better correlates with human plausibility judgements.</p><p>6 0.651842 <a title="102-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Identifying_Bad_Semantic_Neighbors_for_Improving_Distributional_Thesauri.html">185 acl-2013-Identifying Bad Semantic Neighbors for Improving Distributional Thesauri</a></p>

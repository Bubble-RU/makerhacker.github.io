<p>Author: Xiaodong Zeng ; Derek F. Wong ; Lidia S. Chao ; Isabel Trancoso</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation (CWS) approach that co-regularizes character-based and word-based models. Similarly to multi-view learning, the “segmentation agreements” between the two different types of view are used to overcome the scarcity of the label information on unlabeled data. The proposed approach trains a character-based and word-based model on labeled data, respectively, as the initial models. Then, the two models are constantly updated using unlabeled examples, where the learning objective is maximizing their segmentation agreements. The agreements are regarded as a set of valuable constraints for regularizing the learning of both models on unlabeled data. The segmentation for an input sentence is decoded by using a joint scoring function combining the two induced models. The evaluation on the Chinese tree bank reveals that our model results in better gains over the state-of-the-art semi-supervised models reported in the literature.</p><p>3 0.051341813 <a title="171-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Recognizing_Identical_Events_with_Graph_Kernels.html">296 acl-2013-Recognizing Identical Events with Graph Kernels</a></p>
<p>Author: Goran Glavas ; Jan Snajder</p><p>Abstract: Identifying news stories that discuss the same real-world events is important for news tracking and retrieval. Most existing approaches rely on the traditional vector space model. We propose an approach for recognizing identical real-world events based on a structured, event-oriented document representation. We structure documents as graphs of event mentions and use graph kernels to measure the similarity between document pairs. Our experiments indicate that the proposed graph-based approach can outperform the traditional vector space model, and is especially suitable for distinguishing between topically similar, yet non-identical events.</p><p>4 0.040585354 <a title="171-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Topic_Modeling_Based_Classification_of_Clinical_Reports.html">351 acl-2013-Topic Modeling Based Classification of Clinical Reports</a></p>

Some of these data are in the form of free text and require preprocessing to be able to used in automated systems. Efficient and effective use of this data could be vital to the speed and quality of health care. As a case study, we analyzed classification of CT imaging reports into binary categories. In addition to regular text classification, we utilized topic modeling of the entire dataset in various ways. Topic modeling of the corpora provides interpretable themes that exist in these reports. Representing reports according to their topic distributions is more compact than bag-of-words representation and can be processed faster than raw text in subsequent automated processes. A binary topic model was also built as an unsupervised classification approach with the assumption that each topic corresponds to a class. And, finally an aggregate topic classifier was built where reports are classified based on a single discriminative topic that is determined from the training dataset. Our proposed topic based classifier system is shown to be competitive with existing text classification techniques and provides a more efficient and interpretable representation.</p><p>5 0.02678174 <a title="171-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-An_Open_Source_Toolkit_for_Quantitative_Historical_Linguistics.html">48 acl-2013-An Open Source Toolkit for Quantitative Historical Linguistics</a></p>
<p>Author: Johann-Mattis List ; Steven Moran</p><p>Abstract: Given the increasing interest and development of computational and quantitative methods in historical linguistics, it is important that scholars have a basis for documenting, testing, evaluating, and sharing complex workflows. We present a novel open-source toolkit for quantitative tasks in historical linguistics that offers these features. This toolkit also serves as an interface between existing software packages and frequently used data formats, and it provides implementations of new and existing algorithms within a homogeneous framework. We illustrate the toolkit’s functionality with an exemplary workflow that starts with raw language data and ends with automatically calculated phonetic alignments, cognates and borrowings. We then illustrate evaluation metrics on gold standard datasets that are provided with the toolkit.</p><p>6 0.026219768 <a title="171-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Incremental_Topic-Based_Translation_Model_Adaptation_for_Conversational_Spoken_Language_Translation.html">197 acl-2013-Incremental Topic-Based Translation Model Adaptation for Conversational Spoken Language Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Fumiyo Fukumoto ; Yoshimi Suzuki ; Suguru Matsuyoshi</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of dealing with a collection of labeled training documents, especially annotating negative training documents and presents a method of text classification from positive and unlabeled data. We applied an error detection and correction technique to the results of positive and negative documents classified by the Support Vector Machines (SVM). The results using Reuters documents showed that the method was comparable to the current state-of-the-art biasedSVM method as the F-score obtained by our method was 0.627 and biased-SVM was 0.614.</p><p>3 0.3877396 <a title="171-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Scaling_Semi-supervised_Naive_Bayes_with_Feature_Marginals.html">309 acl-2013-Scaling Semi-supervised Naive Bayes with Feature Marginals</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Lucas ; Doug Downey</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods augment standard machine learning (ML) techniques to leverage unlabeled data. SSL techniques are often effective in text classification, where labeled data is scarce but large unlabeled corpora are readily available. However, existing SSL techniques typically require multiple passes over the entirety of the unlabeled data, meaning the techniques are not applicable to large corpora being produced today. In this paper, we show that improving marginal word frequency estimates using unlabeled data can enable semi-supervised text classification that scales to massive unlabeled data sets. We present a novel learning algorithm, which optimizes a Naive Bayes model to accord with statistics calculated from the unlabeled corpus. In experiments with text topic classification and sentiment analysis, we show that our method is both more scalable and more accurate than SSL techniques from previous work.</p><p>4 0.37484249 <a title="171-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Extracting_Events_with_Informal_Temporal_References_in_Personal_Histories_in_Online_Communities.html">153 acl-2013-Extracting Events with Informal Temporal References in Personal Histories in Online Communities</a></p>
<p>Author: Miaomiao Wen ; Zeyu Zheng ; Hyeju Jang ; Guang Xiang ; Carolyn Penstein Rose</p><p>Abstract: We present a system for extracting the dates of illness events (year and month of the event occurrence) from posting histories in the context of an online medical support community. A temporal tagger retrieves and normalizes dates mentioned informally in social media to actual month and year referents. Building on this, an event date extraction system learns to integrate the likelihood of candidate dates extracted from time-rich sentences with temporal constraints extracted from eventrelated sentences. Our integrated model achieves 89.7% of the maximum performance given the performance of the temporal expression retrieval step.</p><p>5 0.3632662 <a title="171-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Temporal_Signals_Help_Label_Temporal_Relations.html">339 acl-2013-Temporal Signals Help Label Temporal Relations</a></p>
<p>Author: Leon Derczynski ; Robert Gaizauskas</p><p>Abstract: Automatically determining the temporal order of events and times in a text is difficult, though humans can readily perform this task. Sometimes events and times are related through use of an explicit co-ordination which gives information about the temporal relation: expressions like “before ” and “as soon as”. We investigate the r oˆle that these co-ordinating temporal signals have in determining the type of temporal relations in discourse. Using machine learning, we improve upon prior approaches to the problem, achieving over 80% accuracy at labelling the types of temporal relation between events and times that are related by temporal signals.</p><p>6 0.33993655 <a title="171-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Topic_Modeling_Based_Classification_of_Clinical_Reports.html">351 acl-2013-Topic Modeling Based Classification of Clinical Reports</a></p>

Experiments on two learner corpora show that the candidate sets increase the coverage of error patterns and domain adaptation improves the performance for verb suggestion.</p><p>4 0.25581944 <a title="171-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Bi-directional_Inter-dependencies_of_Subjective_Expressions_and_Targets_and_their_Value_for_a_Joint_Model.html">67 acl-2013-Bi-directional Inter-dependencies of Subjective Expressions and Targets and their Value for a Joint Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Roman Klinger ; Philipp Cimiano</p><p>Abstract: Opinion mining is often regarded as a classification or segmentation task, involving the prediction of i) subjective expressions, ii) their target and iii) their polarity. Intuitively, these three variables are bidirectionally interdependent, but most work has either attempted to predict them in isolation or proposing pipeline-based approaches that cannot model the bidirectional interaction between these variables. Towards better understanding the interaction between these variables, we propose a model that allows for analyzing the relation of target and subjective phrases in both directions, thus providing an upper bound for the impact of a joint model in comparison to a pipeline model. We report results on two public datasets (cameras and cars), showing that our model outperforms state-ofthe-art models, as well as on a new dataset consisting of Twitter posts.</p><p>5 0.24706839 <a title="171-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Combining_Referring_Expression_Generation_and_Surface_Realization%3A_A_Corpus-Based_Investigation_of_Architectures.html">86 acl-2013-Combining Referring Expression Generation and Surface Realization: A Corpus-Based Investigation of Architectures</a></p>

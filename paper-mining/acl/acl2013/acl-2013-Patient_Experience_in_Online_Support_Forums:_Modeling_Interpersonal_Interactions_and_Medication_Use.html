<p>Author: Huanhuan Liu ; Shoushan Li ; Guodong Zhou ; Chu-ren Huang ; Peifeng Li</p><p>Abstract: Emotion classification can be generally done from both the writer’s and reader’s perspectives. In this study, we find that two foundational tasks in emotion classification, i.e., reader’s emotion classification on the news and writer’s emotion classification on the comments, are strongly related to each other in terms of coarse-grained emotion categories, i.e., negative and positive. On the basis, we propose a respective way to jointly model these two tasks. In particular, a cotraining algorithm is proposed to improve semi-supervised learning of the two tasks. Experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of our joint modeling approach. . 1</p><p>3 0.22383545 <a title="278-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Predicting_and_Eliciting_Addressee%27s_Emotion_in_Online_Dialogue.html">282 acl-2013-Predicting and Eliciting Addressee's Emotion in Online Dialogue</a></p>
<p>Author: Takayuki Hasegawa ; Nobuhiro Kaji ; Naoki Yoshinaga ; Masashi Toyoda</p><p>Abstract: While there have been many attempts to estimate the emotion of an addresser from her/his utterance, few studies have explored how her/his utterance affects the emotion of the addressee. This has motivated us to investigate two novel tasks: predicting the emotion of the addressee and generating a response that elicits a specific emotion in the addressee’s mind. We target Japanese Twitter posts as a source of dialogue data and automatically build training data for learning the predictors and generators. The feasibility of our approaches is assessed by using 1099 utterance-response pairs that are built by . five human workers.</p><p>4 0.18470921 <a title="278-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Probabilistic_Sense_Sentiment_Similarity_through_Hidden_Emotions.html">284 acl-2013-Probabilistic Sense Sentiment Similarity through Hidden Emotions</a></p>
<p>Author: Mitra Mohtarami ; Man Lan ; Chew Lim Tan</p><p>Abstract: Sentiment Similarity of word pairs reflects the distance between the words regarding their underlying sentiments. This paper aims to infer the sentiment similarity between word pairs with respect to their senses. To achieve this aim, we propose a probabilistic emotionbased approach that is built on a hidden emotional model. The model aims to predict a vector of basic human emotions for each sense of the words. The resultant emotional vectors are then employed to infer the sentiment similarity of word pairs. We apply the proposed approach to address two main NLP tasks, namely, Indirect yes/no Question Answer Pairs inference and Sentiment Orientation prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p><p>5 0.15141226 <a title="278-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Utterance-Level_Multimodal_Sentiment_Analysis.html">379 acl-2013-Utterance-Level Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Veronica Perez-Rosas ; Rada Mihalcea ; Louis-Philippe Morency</p><p>Abstract: During real-life interactions, people are naturally gesturing and modulating their voice to emphasize specific points or to express their emotions. With the recent growth of social websites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Amazon, video reviews are emerging as a new source of multimodal and natural opinions that has been left almost untapped by automatic opinion analysis techniques. This paper presents a method for multimodal sentiment classification, which can identify the sentiment expressed in utterance-level visual datastreams. Using a new multimodal dataset consisting of sentiment annotated utterances extracted from video reviews, we show that multimodal sentiment analysis can be effectively performed, and that the joint use of visual, acoustic, and linguistic modalities can lead to error rate reductions of up to 10.5% as compared to the best performing individual modality.</p><p>6 0.14465661 <a title="278-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Character-to-Character_Sentiment_Analysis_in_Shakespeare%27s_Plays.html">79 acl-2013-Character-to-Character Sentiment Analysis in Shakespeare's Plays</a></p>

This literary format’s structured dialogue allows us to make assumptions about who is participating in a conversation. Once we have an idea of who a character is speaking to, the sentiment in his or her speech can be attributed accordingly, allowing us to generate lists of a character’s enemies and allies as well as pinpoint scenes critical to a character’s emotional development.

<p>Author: Arturo Curiel ; Christophe Collet</p><p>Abstract: . This paper explores the use of Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL) as a suitable formal framework for describing Sign Language (SL) , the language of deaf people, in the context of natural language processing. SLs are visual, complete, standalone languages which are just as expressive as oral languages. Signs in SL usually correspond to sequences of highly specific body postures interleaved with movements, which make reference to real world objects, characters or situations. Here we propose a formal representation of SL signs, that will help us with the analysis of automatically-collected hand tracking data from French Sign Language (FSL) video corpora. We further show how such a representation could help us with the design of computer aided SL verification tools, which in turn would bring us closer to the development of an automatic recognition system for these languages.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.75919408 <a title="278-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Patient_Experience_in_Online_Support_Forums%3A_Modeling_Interpersonal_Interactions_and_Medication_Use.html">278 acl-2013-Patient Experience in Online Support Forums: Modeling Interpersonal Interactions and Medication Use</a></p>

<p>Author: Kang Liu ; Liheng Xu ; Jun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: Mining opinion targets is a fundamental and important task for opinion mining from online reviews. To this end, there are usually two kinds of methods: syntax based and alignment based methods. Syntax based methods usually exploited syntactic patterns to extract opinion targets, which were however prone to suffer from parsing errors when dealing with online informal texts. In contrast, alignment based methods used word alignment model to fulfill this task, which could avoid parsing errors without using parsing. However, there is no research focusing on which kind of method is more better when given a certain amount of reviews. To fill this gap, this paper empiri- cally studies how the performance of these two kinds of methods vary when changing the size, domain and language of the corpus. We further combine syntactic patterns with alignment model by using a partially supervised framework and investigate whether this combination is useful or not. In our experiments, we verify that our combination is effective on the corpus with small and medium size.</p><p>4 0.66662878 <a title="278-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Detecting_Turnarounds_in_Sentiment_Analysis%3A_Thwarting.html">117 acl-2013-Detecting Turnarounds in Sentiment Analysis: Thwarting</a></p>
<p>Author: Ankit Ramteke ; Akshat Malu ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya ; J. Saketha Nath</p><p>Abstract: Thwarting and sarcasm are two uncharted territories in sentiment analysis, the former because of the lack of training corpora and the latter because of the enormous amount of world knowledge it demands. In this paper, we propose a working definition of thwarting amenable to machine learning and create a system that detects if the document is thwarted or not. We focus on identifying thwarting in product reviews, especially in the camera domain. An ontology of the camera domain is created. Thwarting is looked upon as the phenomenon of polarity reversal at a higher level of ontology compared to the polarity expressed at the lower level. This notion of thwarting defined with respect to an ontology is novel, to the best of our knowledge. A rule based implementation building upon this idea forms our baseline. We show that machine learning with annotated corpora (thwarted/nonthwarted) is more effective than the rule based system. Because of the skewed distribution of thwarting, we adopt the Areaunder-the-Curve measure of performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at the difficult problem of thwarting detection, which we hope will at Akshat Malu Dept. of Computer Science & Engg., Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India. akshatmalu@ cse .i itb .ac .in J.

<p>Author: Ulle Endriss ; Raquel Fernandez</p><p>Abstract: Crowdsourcing, which offers new ways of cheaply and quickly gathering large amounts of information contributed by volunteers online, has revolutionised the collection of labelled data. Yet, to create annotated linguistic resources from this data, we face the challenge of having to combine the judgements of a potentially large group of annotators. In this paper we investigate how to aggregate individual annotations into a single collective annotation, taking inspiration from the field of social choice theory. We formulate a general formal model for collective annotation and propose several aggregation methods that go beyond the commonly used majority rule. We test some of our methods on data from a crowdsourcing experiment on textual entailment annotation.</p><p>6 0.66322505 <a title="278-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Mining_Opinion_Words_and_Opinion_Targets_in_a_Two-Stage_Framework.html">244 acl-2013-Mining Opinion Words and Opinion Targets in a Two-Stage Framework</a></p>

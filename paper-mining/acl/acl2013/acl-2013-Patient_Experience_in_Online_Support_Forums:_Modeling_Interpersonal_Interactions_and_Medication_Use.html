</p><p>6 1  Introduction  Online support groups are a rich source of information concerning patient experiences, but they are far different from clinical content. [sent-13, score-0.328]
</p><p>7 Instead of “The patient presents with… ” and “denies vomiting,” patients may speak of their “doc” and “rheumy. [sent-14, score-0.438]
</p><p>8 ” Patients may raise issues that they may be reticent to speak with health care practitioners about, day-to-day condition management issues, or personal strategies that they have for taking medicine. [sent-16, score-0.149]
</p><p>9 In recent years, it has been observed that patients may be a valuable source of expertise to other patients, and that they provide information that is different from the expertise of clinicians (Civan & Pratt, 2007; Hartzler & Pratt, 201 1). [sent-17, score-0.369]
</p><p>10 …  This content can be extremely valuable to clinicians and patients alike; however, to date most interfaces for patient-generated content offer few features tailored to the unique nature of the content in these support forums. [sent-19, score-0.509]
</p><p>11 Thus, the objective of the current paper was to explore techniques for extracting and visualizing dimensions of patient experience. [sent-20, score-0.219]
</p><p>12 For this preliminary work, two specific dimensions were selected: interpersonal interactions and medication use. [sent-21, score-0.905]
</p><p>13 Interpersonal interactions are an important dimension to consider because others have such a profound impact on patient experience. [sent-22, score-0.307]
</p><p>14 Thus, automatic identification of patient experiences with others, e. [sent-24, score-0.294]
</p><p>15 Scientists could use this to study social support, physician-patient communication and other types of interpersonal interactions. [sent-28, score-0.226]
</p><p>16 Integrated into a search interface, patients could search for others with similar experiences, and see if there are strategies that they could use to address their own problem. [sent-29, score-0.281]
</p><p>17 Medication use is another important dimension of patient experience. [sent-30, score-0.19]
</p><p>18 There has also been an increased interest in the use of online discussion content to predict adverse events and monitor off-label prescription practices (e. [sent-31, score-0.207]
</p><p>19 This work differs from previous literature in that the method identifies and visually contextualizes patient medication experiences, particularly in terms of stages of use and affect. [sent-37, score-0.808]
</p><p>20 With regard to the former, a large number of studies have employed the software, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), to compare emotional expression in communities or associations between emotional expression and health outcomes (e. [sent-41, score-0.443]
</p><p>21 Other studies of online support groups have focused on social support. [sent-46, score-0.187]
</p><p>22 (2010) examined the effects of exchanging treatment information within computer-mediated breast cancer support groups on emotional wellbeing. [sent-49, score-0.573]
</p><p>23 For example, the 2009 i2b2 medication challenge focused on the extraction of medica-  tion-related information from discharge summaries including: medication name, dosage, mode, frequency, duration and reason (Spasic et al. [sent-52, score-1.266]
</p><p>24 This study differs from previous work in that, the focus is not on the time of day or the frequency of medication use, but rather, the stage in the adoption/discontinuation of a medication an individual is at. [sent-54, score-1.236]
</p><p>25 An affective lexicon, WordNet-Affect was used to identify words with emotional content in the text (Strapparava & Valitutti, 2004). [sent-63, score-0.17]
</p><p>26 However, forum participants wrote in ways that often departed from medical terminology; thus, it was decided that manually constructed lexicons of medication names, side effects and people would be more effective. [sent-65, score-0.955]
</p><p>27 4  Results  The results are reported in three parts: descriptive statistics for the corpus, interaction with others and medication information. [sent-66, score-0.651]
</p><p>28 1 Corpus The corpus is comprised of discussion posts for three conditions. [sent-68, score-0.167]
</p><p>29 Since the first part of this study examines interpersonal interactions, three conditions were selected in which key support interactions and level of affect were expected to differ. [sent-69, score-0.413]
</p><p>30 2 Modeling Interpersonal Interactions This work first addresses the challenge of modeling interpersonal interactions. [sent-71, score-0.174]
</p><p>31 In order to extract these relations, the researcher manually compiled a list of terms indicating such relations through review of social support literature pertaining to the focal conditions and manual analysis of the text. [sent-74, score-0.196]
</p><p>32 Many of the instances of the word “family” appeared were references to family doctors or family history; these references were excluded from the estimates (Table 2). [sent-76, score-0.275]
</p><p>33 These results show that certain types of individuals tend to appear in forum conversations for certain conditions over others: mothers, family and friends in breast cancer; sons, daughters, and “people” in Type 1 diabetes; and doctors in fi17  bromyalgia. [sent-77, score-0.479]
</p><p>34 As can be seen, many posts do not include references to other people, but rather, focus on other areas such as patients’ own experiences. [sent-78, score-0.111]
</p><p>35 Many lexicons classify words as positive or negative or by a limited set of emotions; however, with complex issues like health and interpersonal interactions, there may be multiple dimensions. [sent-83, score-0.251]
</p><p>36 Following a re-  view of emotion research and preliminary content analysis of the corpus, seven emotions were selected on the basis of frequency and relevance to the conditions (Table 3). [sent-85, score-0.197]
</p><p>37 Table 3: Examples of Emotional Expression The percentage of posts expressing various affect types was calculated (Table 4). [sent-86, score-0.166]
</p><p>38 The highest proportion of fear, happiness and hope were seen in the breast cancer forum. [sent-88, score-0.257]
</p><p>39 Though anger and frustration were not as common as other emotions, higher levels of these emotions in diabetes are perhaps worthy of note. [sent-89, score-0.179]
</p><p>40 Table 4: Percentage of Posts Expressing Emotions Radar graphs illustrating the extent of emotional expression for the various roles were generated to facilitate comparison (Fig. [sent-90, score-0.167]
</p><p>41 The light blue line, representing “doctor,” is the innermost ring in all cases, demonstrating that emotional expression occurs least often in posts that men-  tion doctors. [sent-92, score-0.278]
</p><p>42 Posts mentioning family (dark blue lines) were generally associated with higher degrees of emotional expression. [sent-93, score-0.217]
</p><p>43 Moreover, it is interesting that the patterns of emotional expression are quite different across conditions. [sent-94, score-0.167]
</p><p>44 For this preliminary work, this action was undertaken with the fibromyalgia forum. [sent-96, score-0.227]
</p><p>45 Arranging person-verb pairings together in an interface could be a convenient way to acquire a sense of what patients are being told, and what medications doctors are prescribing. [sent-100, score-0.62]
</p><p>46 For example, with regard to patient experiences with doctors prescribing Lyrica, the system might retrieve: “Recently my doctor put me on  Lyrica which did help but had me… ,” “My doctor gave me a ‘taper down’ schedule,” “My doctor prescribed Lyrica which Irefused to take. [sent-102, score-0.857]
</p><p>47 ” Patients could use such a system to acquire a sense of the range of experiences that others have had with the drug. [sent-103, score-0.137]
</p><p>48 , breast cancer discussion more commonly focuses on treatments, and fibromyalgia discussions tend to focus more on medications (Chen, 2012). [sent-109, score-0.748]
</p><p>49 Thus, in this study, the researcher selected fibromyalgia as a case study for modeling discussion or comments about medication use. [sent-110, score-0.945]
</p><p>50 The researcher created a lexicon of drug names for use in this study, drawn from a review of fibromyalgia literature and information resources, as well as manual review of corpus content. [sent-111, score-0.34]
</p><p>51 The most common medications are listed in Table 3. [sent-112, score-0.246]
</p><p>52 ” Discontinuation referred to when an individual stopped using one medication, and switching to when an individual changed from using one medication to another. [sent-118, score-0.647]
</p><p>53 Information such as whether side effects were temporary, withdrawal symptoms and interactions/contraindications was also extracted. [sent-119, score-0.204]
</p><p>54 These rules were implemented at the sentence level to prevent misattributions of side effects when multiple medications are mentioned in the same post. [sent-120, score-0.419]
</p><p>55 Table 6: Medication Phase Extraction Rules Using an interface designed for this study, the researcher investigated the reporting of side effects during each phase. [sent-121, score-0.26]
</p><p>56 Though the most common side effects for a drug were generally reported in multiple phases, certain side effects were reported in a given phase but not another. [sent-122, score-0.467]
</p><p>57 The last column, “no stage,” depicts posts that did not contain explicit refer-  ences to a specific phase of medication use. [sent-123, score-0.781]
</p><p>58 Figure 2: Mentions of Side Effects for Lyrica, Distinguished by Phase Figure 2 shows that, for Lyrica, the predominant symptom that was reported by patients was weight gain, which appeared in almost all phases. [sent-124, score-0.248]
</p><p>59 Figure 3 : Mentions of Side Effects for Savella, Distinguished by Phase Another important aspect of patients’ experience with certain medications is their attitude towards it. [sent-127, score-0.32]
</p><p>60 In the previous section, the focus was on emotions because they are important for understanding interpersonal interaction. [sent-128, score-0.248]
</p><p>61 In the case of medications, rather than tracking the appearance of emotion, it may be useful to consider positive/negative polarity, whether the medication works or not, and side effects. [sent-129, score-0.693]
</p><p>62 Thus, in addition to side effects, sentences with positive and negative sentiment were ex-  tracted using WordNet-Affect. [sent-130, score-0.129]
</p><p>63 A rule-based system was implemented to identify instances in which participants mentioned whether a medication worked or not. [sent-133, score-0.646]
</p><p>64 These do not add up to the number of medication mentions, as many times when medications appear, sentiment is neutral or ambiguous, and perception of efficacy is not the topic of the post. [sent-136, score-0.966]
</p><p>65 For example, the text might say, “The doctor started me on Savella yesterday. [sent-137, score-0.139]
</p><p>66 ” These results illustrate the utility of extract-  ing multiple facets of patient medication experience, e. [sent-138, score-0.808]
</p><p>67 positive/negative valence, efficacy and side effects, in order to better understand these experiences. [sent-140, score-0.123]
</p><p>68 For example, overall sentiment towards many medications is negative, but they are reported as working more often than not. [sent-142, score-0.3]
</p><p>69 The side effects tell yet another story; in many cases, the side effects are different in different phases. [sent-143, score-0.346]
</p><p>70 Reading the content, one comes to understand that, in an overwhelming number of cases, it is not that patients have found medications that solve all their problems, but that they are selecting ones that work and weighing the costs of the side effects. [sent-144, score-0.569]

</p><p>72 ” Doing so would retrieve advice such as: “Ask ur doctor about Elavil and Lyrica combination,” “She suggested staying on the Lyrica… . [sent-149, score-0.177]
</p><p>73 ” …  …  …  …  Forum posts are valuable because they are rich troves of patient experience; however, their richness means that it is also possible to get lost in the story. [sent-151, score-0.301]
</p><p>74 5  Discussion and Implications  This study employed NLP techniques in order to model two dimensions of patient experience in online support forums: interpersonal interactions and medication use. [sent-153, score-1.271]
</p><p>75 With regard to interactions with others, the prominence of different individuals and associated affect differed depending on condition. [sent-154, score-0.234]
</p><p>76 With regard to medication use, patients’ experiences of medication use differed along phase of adoption. [sent-155, score-1.455]
</p><p>77 For example, in posts about family that contained fear and anxiety, certain topics tended to occur often: family history, families being supportive or non-supportive, and concerns of worrying the family. [sent-157, score-0.348]
</p><p>78 In particular, the prominence of doctors, and relatively infrequent mention of family and friends was worthy of note. [sent-161, score-0.16]
</p><p>79 Previous research has found that fibromyalgia patients report a lack of understanding from medical practitioners and others around them (e. [sent-162, score-0.614]
</p><p>80 These reports of interactions with medical practitioners could help researchers to understand where gaps in knowledge and communication exist in both parties, and attempt to rectify them. [sent-165, score-0.19]
</p><p>81 The content from online support forums may also be helpful for researchers seeking to understand patients’ patterns of interpersonal interaction. [sent-166, score-0.357]
</p><p>82 The framework presented here for modeling medication use could be useful in many settings. [sent-167, score-0.618]
</p><p>83 Visualizing side effects at various points in the adoption, use and perhaps discontinua21 tion of a medication could avert potential mis-  understandings. [sent-168, score-0.791]
</p><p>84 For example, sentiment analysis on a medication X might be favorable overall; however, decomposing the posts by phase might show that users initially react favorably, but develop problems with it over time. [sent-169, score-0.835]
</p><p>85 Of course, the converse, that individuals experience certain side effects initially, but that these disappear over time, could also be true. [sent-170, score-0.308]
</p><p>86 First, in the case of interpersonal interactions, affect was modeled as dichotomous variable indicating presence or absence. [sent-174, score-0.229]
</p><p>87 However, the level of emotional expression in a post could vary substantially. [sent-175, score-0.167]
</p><p>88 In the case of medication use, extraction of  relevant sentences was based on presence of the medication name; thus, the system would not have identified sentences in which pronouns were used. [sent-177, score-1.266]
</p><p>89 Because previous research has indicated that medications are a common topic in fibromyalgia-related discussion, medication use was a natural target for modeling discussion content. [sent-179, score-0.92]
</p><p>90 Treatments such as massage and aqua therapy are often used in fibromyalgia, and treatments are the foci for many other conditions, such as breast cancer. [sent-181, score-0.173]
</p><p>91 Rather than considering phases of medication use, one might consider psychological state and expectations prior to, during and after treatment. [sent-182, score-0.666]
</p><p>92 Lastly, the interface that was developed for exploring medication use was specific to fibromyalgia; moving forward, it would be useful to expand the interface to other conditions. [sent-183, score-0.704]

<p>Author: Mitra Mohtarami ; Man Lan ; Chew Lim Tan</p><p>Abstract: Sentiment Similarity of word pairs reflects the distance between the words regarding their underlying sentiments. This paper aims to infer the sentiment similarity between word pairs with respect to their senses. To achieve this aim, we propose a probabilistic emotionbased approach that is built on a hidden emotional model. The model aims to predict a vector of basic human emotions for each sense of the words. The resultant emotional vectors are then employed to infer the sentiment similarity of word pairs. We apply the proposed approach to address two main NLP tasks, namely, Indirect yes/no Question Answer Pairs inference and Sentiment Orientation prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p><p>3 0.081360251 <a title="278-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Discovering_User_Interactions_in_Ideological_Discussions.html">121 acl-2013-Discovering User Interactions in Ideological Discussions</a></p>
<p>Author: Arjun Mukherjee ; Bing Liu</p><p>Abstract: Online discussion forums are a popular platform for people to voice their opinions on any subject matter and to discuss or debate any issue of interest. In forums where users discuss social, political, or religious issues, there are often heated debates among users or participants. Existing research has studied mining of user stances or camps on certain issues, opposing perspectives, and contention points. In this paper, we focus on identifying the nature of interactions among user pairs. The central questions are: How does each pair of users interact with each other? Does the pair of users mostly agree or disagree? What is the lexicon that people often use to express agreement and disagreement? We present a topic model based approach to answer these questions. Since agreement and disagreement expressions are usually multiword phrases, we propose to employ a ranking method to identify highly relevant phrases prior to topic modeling. After modeling, we use the modeling results to classify the nature of interaction of each user pair. Our evaluation results using real-life discussion/debate posts demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.</p><p>4 0.07744246 <a title="278-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Predicting_and_Eliciting_Addressee%27s_Emotion_in_Online_Dialogue.html">282 acl-2013-Predicting and Eliciting Addressee's Emotion in Online Dialogue</a></p>

This has motivated us to investigate two novel tasks: predicting the emotion of the addressee and generating a response that elicits a specific emotion in the addressee’s mind.

<p>Author: Annie Chen</p><p>Abstract: Though there has been substantial research concerning the extraction of information from clinical notes, to date there has been less work concerning the extraction of useful information from patient-generated content. Using a dataset comprised of online support group discussion content, this paper investigates two dimensions that may be important in the extraction of patient-generated experiences from text; significant individuals/groups and medication use. With regard to the former, the paper describes an approach involving the pairing of important figures (e.g. family, husbands, doctors, etc.) and affect, and suggests possible applications of such techniques to research concerning online social support, as well as integration into search interfaces for patients. Additionally, the paper demonstrates the extraction of side effects and sentiment at different phases in patient medication use, e.g. adoption, current use, discontinuation and switching, and demonstrates the utility of such an application for drug safety monitoring in online discussion forums. 1</p><p>2 0.63470763 <a title="278-lsi-2" href="./acl-2013-Predicting_and_Eliciting_Addressee%27s_Emotion_in_Online_Dialogue.html">282 acl-2013-Predicting and Eliciting Addressee's Emotion in Online Dialogue</a></p>

This has motivated us to investigate two novel tasks: predicting the emotion of the addressee and generating a response that elicits a specific emotion in the addressee’s mind. We target Japanese Twitter posts as a source of dialogue data and automatically build training data for learning the predictors and generators.

<p>Author: Huanhuan Liu ; Shoushan Li ; Guodong Zhou ; Chu-ren Huang ; Peifeng Li</p><p>Abstract: Emotion classification can be generally done from both the writer’s and reader’s perspectives. In this study, we find that two foundational tasks in emotion classification, i.e., reader’s emotion classification on the news and writer’s emotion classification on the comments, are strongly related to each other in terms of coarse-grained emotion categories, i.e., negative and positive. On the basis, we propose a respective way to jointly model these two tasks. In particular, a cotraining algorithm is proposed to improve semi-supervised learning of the two tasks. Experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of our joint modeling approach. . 1</p><p>4 0.58594096 <a title="278-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Character-to-Character_Sentiment_Analysis_in_Shakespeare%27s_Plays.html">79 acl-2013-Character-to-Character Sentiment Analysis in Shakespeare's Plays</a></p>

<p>Author: Veronica Perez-Rosas ; Rada Mihalcea ; Louis-Philippe Morency</p><p>Abstract: During real-life interactions, people are naturally gesturing and modulating their voice to emphasize specific points or to express their emotions. With the recent growth of social websites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Amazon, video reviews are emerging as a new source of multimodal and natural opinions that has been left almost untapped by automatic opinion analysis techniques. This paper presents a method for multimodal sentiment classification, which can identify the sentiment expressed in utterance-level visual datastreams. Using a new multimodal dataset consisting of sentiment annotated utterances extracted from video reviews, we show that multimodal sentiment analysis can be effectively performed, and that the joint use of visual, acoustic, and linguistic modalities can lead to error rate reductions of up to 10.5% as compared to the best performing individual modality.</p><p>6 0.55060714 <a title="278-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-A_computational_approach_to_politeness_with_application_to_social_factors.html">30 acl-2013-A computational approach to politeness with application to social factors</a></p>

<p>Author: Romain Deveaud ; Eric SanJuan ; Patrice Bellot</p><p>Abstract: The current topic modeling approaches for Information Retrieval do not allow to explicitly model query-oriented latent topics. More, the semantic coherence of the topics has never been considered in this field. We propose a model-based feedback approach that learns Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic models on the top-ranked pseudo-relevant feedback, and we measure the semantic coherence of those topics. We perform a first experimental evaluation using two major TREC test collections. Results show that retrieval perfor- mances tend to be better when using topics with higher semantic coherence.</p><p>3 0.97207612 <a title="278-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Fine-grained_Semantic_Typing_of_Emerging_Entities.html">160 acl-2013-Fine-grained Semantic Typing of Emerging Entities</a></p>
<p>Author: Ndapandula Nakashole ; Tomasz Tylenda ; Gerhard Weikum</p><p>Abstract: Methods for information extraction (IE) and knowledge base (KB) construction have been intensively studied. However, a largely under-explored case is tapping into highly dynamic sources like news streams and social media, where new entities are continuously emerging. In this paper, we present a method for discovering and semantically typing newly emerging out-ofKB entities, thus improving the freshness and recall of ontology-based IE and improving the precision and semantic rigor of open IE. Our method is based on a probabilistic model that feeds weights into integer linear programs that leverage type signatures of relational phrases and type correlation or disjointness constraints. Our experimental evaluation, based on crowdsourced user studies, show our method performing significantly better than prior work.</p><p>4 0.97015595 <a title="278-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Building_and_Evaluating_a_Distributional_Memory_for_Croatian.html">76 acl-2013-Building and Evaluating a Distributional Memory for Croatian</a></p>

<p>Author: Chris Quirk ; Pallavi Choudhury</p><p>Abstract: Ambiguity preserving representations such as lattices are very useful in a number of NLP tasks, including paraphrase generation, paraphrase recognition, and machine translation evaluation. Lattices compactly represent lexical variation, but word order variation leads to a combinatorial explosion of states. We advocate hypergraphs as compact representations for sets of utterances describing the same event or object. We present a method to construct hypergraphs from sets of utterances, and evaluate this method on a simple recognition task. Given a set of utterances that describe a single object or event, we construct such a hypergraph, and demonstrate that it can recognize novel descriptions of the same event with high accuracy.</p><p>6 0.95439988 <a title="278-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-A_relatedness_benchmark_to_test_the_role_of_determiners_in_compositional_distributional_semantics.html">32 acl-2013-A relatedness benchmark to test the role of determiners in compositional distributional semantics</a></p>

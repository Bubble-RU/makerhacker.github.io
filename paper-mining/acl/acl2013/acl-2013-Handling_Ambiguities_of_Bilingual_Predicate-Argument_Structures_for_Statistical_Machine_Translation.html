</p><p>5 In this way, we incorporate rich context information of PAS for disambiguation. [sent-8, score-0.076]
</p><p>6 Then we integrate the two methods into a PASbased translation framework. [sent-9, score-0.089]
</p><p>7 Experiments show that our approach helps to achieve significant improvements on translation quality. [sent-10, score-0.066]
</p><p>8 1  Introduction  Predicate-argument structure (PAS) depicts the relationship between a predicate and its associated arguments, which indicates the skeleton structure of a sentence on semantic level. [sent-11, score-0.133]
</p><p>9 Basically, PAS agrees much better between two languages than syntax structure (Fung et al. [sent-12, score-0.047]
</p><p>10 Considering that current syntaxbased translation models are always impaired by cross-lingual structure divergence (Eisner, 2003; Zhang et al. [sent-14, score-0.166]
</p><p>11 , 2010), PAS is really a better representation of a sentence pair to model the bilingual structure mapping. [sent-15, score-0.07]
</p><p>12 However, since a source-side PAS might correspond to multiple different target-side PASs, there usually exist many PAS ambiguities during translation. [sent-16, score-0.229]
</p><p>13 For example, in Figure 1, (a) and (b) carry the same source-side PAS <[A0]1 [Pred(是)]2 [A1]3> for Chinese predicate “是”. [sent-17, score-0.044]
</p><p>14 However, in Figure 1(a), the corresponding target-side-like PAS is <[X1] [X2] [X3]>, while in Figure 1(b), the counterpart target-side-like PAS 1 is <[X2] [X3] [X1]>. [sent-18, score-0.022]
</p><p>15 This is because the two PASs play different roles in their corresponding sentences. [sent-19, score-0.026]
</p><p>16 Actually, Figure 1(a) is an independ-  ent PAS, while Figure 1(b) is a modifier of the noun phrase “中  国 和 俄罗斯”. [sent-20, score-0.036]
</p><p>17 We call this kind  of PAS ambiguity role ambiguity. [sent-21, score-0.169]
</p><p>18 Meanwhile, Figure 1 also depicts another kind of PAS ambiguity. [sent-24, score-0.065]
</p><p>19 However, they are different because in Figure 1(c), there is a gap string “对 运动员” between [A0] and [Pred]. [sent-26, score-0.139]
</p><p>20 Generally, the gap strings are due to the low recall of automatic semantic role labeling (SRL) or complex sentence structures. [sent-27, score-0.185]
</p><p>21 For example, in Figure 1(c), the gap string “对 运动员 ” is actually an argument “AM-PRP” of the PAS, but the SRL system has 1We use target-side-like PAS to refer to a list of general non-terminals in target language order, where a nonterminal aligns to a source argument.

</p><p>24 We call this kind of PAS ambiguity gap ambiguity. [sent-32, score-0.252]
</p><p>25 During translation, these PAS ambiguities will greatly affect the PAS-based translation models. [sent-33, score-0.244]
</p><p>26 Therefore, in order to incorporate the bilingual PAS into machine translation effectively, we need to decide which target-side-like PAS should be chosen for a specific source-side PAS. [sent-34, score-0.126]
</p><p>27 In this paper, we propose two novel methods to incorporate rich context information to handle PAS ambiguities. [sent-36, score-0.132]
</p><p>28 Towards the gap ambiguity, we adopt a method called inside context integration to extend PAS to IC-PAS. [sent-37, score-0.237]
</p><p>29 In terms of IC-PAS, the gap strings are combined effectively to deal with the gap ambiguities. [sent-38, score-0.29]
</p><p>30 As to the role ambiguity, we design a novel maximum entropy PAS disambiguation (MEPD) model to combine various context features, such as context words of PAS. [sent-39, score-0.2]
</p><p>31 For each ambiguous source-side PAS, we build a specific MEPD model to select appropriate target-side-like PAS for translation. [sent-40, score-0.024]
</p><p>32 We will detail the two methods in Section 3 and 4 respectively. [sent-41, score-0.012]
</p><p>33 Finally, we integrate the above two methods into a PAS-based translation framework (Zhai et al. [sent-42, score-0.105]
</p><p>34 Experiments show that the two PAS disambiguation methods significantly improve the baseline translation system. [sent-44, score-0.108]
</p><p>35 The main contribution of this work can be concluded as follows: 1) We define two kinds of PAS ambiguities: role ambiguity and gap ambiguity. [sent-45, score-0.256]
</p><p>36 To our  best knowledge, we are the first to handle these PAS ambiguities for SMT. [sent-46, score-0.193]
</p><p>37 2) Towards the two different ambiguities, we design two specific methods for PAS disambiguation: inside context integration and the novel MEPD model. [sent-47, score-0.163]
</p><p>38 2  PAS-based Translation Framework  PAS-based translation framework is to perform translation based on PAS transformation (Zhai et al. [sent-48, score-0.21]
</p><p>39 In the framework, a source-side PAS is first converted into target-side-like PASs by PAS transformation rules, and then perform translation based on the obtained target-side-like PASs. [sent-50, score-0.141]
</p><p>40 1  PAS Transformation Rules  PAS transformation rules (PASTR) are used to convert a source-side PAS into a target one. [sent-52, score-0.095]

<p>Author: ThuyLinh Nguyen ; Stephan Vogel</p><p>Abstract: Hiero translation models have two limitations compared to phrase-based models: 1) Limited hypothesis space; 2) No lexicalized reordering model. We propose an extension of Hiero called PhrasalHiero to address Hiero’s second problem. Phrasal-Hiero still has the same hypothesis space as the original Hiero but incorporates a phrase-based distance cost feature and lexicalized reodering features into the chart decoder. The work consists of two parts: 1) for each Hiero translation derivation, find its corresponding dis- continuous phrase-based path. 2) Extend the chart decoder to incorporate features from the phrase-based path. We achieve significant improvement over both Hiero and phrase-based baselines for ArabicEnglish, Chinese-English and GermanEnglish translation.</p><p>3 0.092721045 <a title="180-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Using_Conceptual_Class_Attributes_to_Characterize_Social_Media_Users.html">373 acl-2013-Using Conceptual Class Attributes to Characterize Social Media Users</a></p>
<p>Author: Shane Bergsma ; Benjamin Van Durme</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel approach for automatically predicting the hidden demographic properties of social media users. Building on prior work in common-sense knowledge acquisition from third-person text, we first learn the distinguishing attributes of certain classes of people. For example, we learn that people in the Female class tend to have maiden names and engagement rings. We then show that this knowledge can be used in the analysis of first-person communication; knowledge of distinguishing attributes allows us to both classify users and to bootstrap new training examples. Our novel approach enables substantial improvements on the widelystudied task of user gender prediction, ob- taining a 20% relative error reduction over the current state-of-the-art.</p><p>4 0.059522048 <a title="180-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Semantic_Roles_for_String_to_Tree_Machine_Translation.html">314 acl-2013-Semantic Roles for String to Tree Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jiajun Zhang ; Chengqing Zong</p><p>Abstract: Currently, almost all of the statistical machine translation (SMT) models are trained with the parallel corpora in some specific domains. However, when it comes to a language pair or a different domain without any bilingual resources, the traditional SMT loses its power. Recently, some research works study the unsupervised SMT for inducing a simple word-based translation model from the monolingual corpora. It successfully bypasses the constraint of bitext for SMT and obtains a relatively promising result. In this paper, we take a step forward and propose a simple but effective method to induce a phrase-based model from the monolingual corpora given an automatically-induced translation lexicon or a manually-edited translation dictionary. We apply our method for the domain adaptation task and the extensive experiments show that our proposed method can substantially improve the translation quality. 1</p><p>6 0.054483328 <a title="180-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Automatic_Term_Ambiguity_Detection.html">62 acl-2013-Automatic Term Ambiguity Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Mei Tu ; Yu Zhou ; Chengqing Zong</p><p>Abstract: Rhetorical structure theory (RST) is widely used for discourse understanding, which represents a discourse as a hierarchically semantic structure. In this paper, we propose a novel translation framework with the help of RST. In our framework, the translation process mainly includes three steps: 1) Source RST-tree acquisition: a source sentence is parsed into an RST tree; 2) Rule extraction: translation rules are extracted from the source tree and the target string via bilingual word alignment; 3) RST-based translation: the source RST-tree is translated with translation rules. Experiments on Chinese-to-English show that our RST-based approach achieves improvements of 2.3/0.77/1.43 BLEU points on NIST04/NIST05/CWMT2008 respectively. 1</p><p>5 0.51251978 <a title="180-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-A_Markov_Model_of_Machine_Translation_using_Non-parametric_Bayesian_Inference.html">10 acl-2013-A Markov Model of Machine Translation using Non-parametric Bayesian Inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Yang Feng ; Trevor Cohn</p><p>Abstract: Most modern machine translation systems use phrase pairs as translation units, allowing for accurate modelling of phraseinternal translation and reordering. However phrase-based approaches are much less able to model sentence level effects between different phrase-pairs. We propose a new model to address this imbalance, based on a word-based Markov model of translation which generates target translations left-to-right. Our model encodes word and phrase level phenomena by conditioning translation decisions on previous decisions and uses a hierarchical Pitman-Yor Process prior to provide dynamic adaptive smoothing. This mechanism implicitly supports not only traditional phrase pairs, but also gapping phrases which are non-consecutive in the source. Our experiments on Chinese to English and Arabic to English translation show consistent improvements over competitive baselines, of up to +3.4 BLEU.</p><p>6 0.50901884 <a title="180-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Travatar%3A_A_Forest-to-String_Machine_Translation_Engine_based_on_Tree_Transducers.html">361 acl-2013-Travatar: A Forest-to-String Machine Translation Engine based on Tree Transducers</a></p>

<p>Author: Feifei Zhai ; Jiajun Zhang ; Yu Zhou ; Chengqing Zong</p><p>Abstract: Predicate-argument structure (PAS) has been demonstrated to be very effective in improving SMT performance. However, since a sourceside PAS might correspond to multiple different target-side PASs, there usually exist many PAS ambiguities during translation. In this paper, we group PAS ambiguities into two types: role ambiguity and gap ambiguity. Then we propose two novel methods to handle the two PAS ambiguities for SMT accordingly: 1) inside context integration; 2) a novel maximum entropy PAS disambiguation (MEPD) model. In this way, we incorporate rich context information of PAS for disambiguation. Then we integrate the two methods into a PASbased translation framework. Experiments show that our approach helps to achieve significant improvements on translation quality. 1</p><p>2 0.70474917 <a title="180-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-AnnoMarket%3A_An_Open_Cloud_Platform_for_NLP.html">51 acl-2013-AnnoMarket: An Open Cloud Platform for NLP</a></p>
<p>Author: Valentin Tablan ; Kalina Bontcheva ; Ian Roberts ; Hamish Cunningham ; Marin Dimitrov</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents AnnoMarket, an open cloud-based platform which enables researchers to deploy, share, and use language processing components and resources, following the data-as-a-service and software-as-a-service paradigms. The focus is on multilingual text analysis resources and services, based on an opensource infrastructure and compliant with relevant NLP standards. We demonstrate how the AnnoMarket platform can be used to develop NLP applications with little or no programming, to index the results for enhanced browsing and search, and to evaluate performance. Utilising AnnoMarket is straightforward, since cloud infrastructural issues are dealt with by the platform, completely transparently to the user: load balancing, efficient data upload and storage, deployment on the virtual machines, security, and fault tolerance.</p><p>3 0.48090681 <a title="180-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Social_Text_Normalization_using_Contextual_Graph_Random_Walks.html">326 acl-2013-Social Text Normalization using Contextual Graph Random Walks</a></p>
<p>Author: Hany Hassan ; Arul Menezes</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a social media text normalization system that can be deployed as a preprocessing step for Machine Translation and various NLP applications to handle social media text. The proposed system is based on unsupervised learning of the normalization equivalences from unlabeled text. The proposed approach uses Random Walks on a contextual similarity bipartite graph constructed from n-gram sequences on large unlabeled text corpus. We show that the proposed approach has a very high precision of (92.43) and a reasonable recall of (56.4). When used as a preprocessing step for a state-of-the-art machine translation system, the translation quality on social media text improved by 6%. The proposed approach is domain and language independent and can be deployed as a preprocessing step for any NLP application to handle social media text.</p><p>4 0.4663215 <a title="180-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Co-regularizing_character-based_and_word-based_models_for_semi-supervised_Chinese_word_segmentation.html">82 acl-2013-Co-regularizing character-based and word-based models for semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaodong Zeng ; Derek F. Wong ; Lidia S. Chao ; Isabel Trancoso</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation (CWS) approach that co-regularizes character-based and word-based models. Similarly to multi-view learning, the “segmentation agreements” between the two different types of view are used to overcome the scarcity of the label information on unlabeled data. The proposed approach trains a character-based and word-based model on labeled data, respectively, as the initial models. Then, the two models are constantly updated using unlabeled examples, where the learning objective is maximizing their segmentation agreements. The agreements are regarded as a set of valuable constraints for regularizing the learning of both models on unlabeled data. The segmentation for an input sentence is decoded by using a joint scoring function combining the two induced models. The evaluation on the Chinese tree bank reveals that our model results in better gains over the state-of-the-art semi-supervised models reported in the literature.</p><p>5 0.45865816 <a title="180-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Models_of_Semantic_Representation_with_Visual_Attributes.html">249 acl-2013-Models of Semantic Representation with Visual Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Carina Silberer ; Vittorio Ferrari ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of grounding the meaning of words in the physical world and focus on the visual modality which we represent by visual attributes. We create a new large-scale taxonomy of visual attributes covering more than 500 concepts and their corresponding 688K images. We use this dataset to train attribute classifiers and integrate their predictions with text-based distributional models of word meaning. We show that these bimodal models give a better fit to human word association data compared to amodal models and word representations based on handcrafted norming data.</p><p>6 0.45683527 <a title="180-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Statistical_Machine_Translation_Improves_Question_Retrieval_in_Community_Question_Answering_via_Matrix_Factorization.html">329 acl-2013-Statistical Machine Translation Improves Question Retrieval in Community Question Answering via Matrix Factorization</a></p>

<p>Author: Svitlana Volkova ; Pallavi Choudhury ; Chris Quirk ; Bill Dolan ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: Procedural dialog systems can help users achieve a wide range of goals. However, such systems are challenging to build, currently requiring manual engineering of substantial domain-specific task knowledge and dialog management strategies. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn procedural dialog systems given only light supervision, of the type that can be provided by non-experts. We consider domains where the required task knowledge exists in textual form (e.g., instructional web pages) and where system builders have access to statements of user intent (e.g., search query logs or dialog interactions). To learn from such textual resources, we describe a novel approach that first automatically extracts task knowledge from instructions, then learns a dialog manager over this task knowledge to provide assistance. Evaluation in a Microsoft Office domain shows that the individual components are highly accurate and can be integrated into a dialog system that provides effective help to users.</p><p>3 0.29052278 <a title="168-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Conditional_Random_Fields_for_Responsive_Surface_Realisation_using_Global_Features.html">90 acl-2013-Conditional Random Fields for Responsive Surface Realisation using Global Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Nina Dethlefs ; Helen Hastie ; Heriberto Cuayahuitl ; Oliver Lemon</p><p>Abstract: Surface realisers in spoken dialogue systems need to be more responsive than conventional surface realisers. They need to be sensitive to the utterance context as well as robust to partial or changing generator inputs. We formulate surface realisation as a sequence labelling task and combine the use of conditional random fields (CRFs) with semantic trees. Due to their extended notion of context, CRFs are able to take the global utterance context into account and are less constrained by local features than other realisers. This leads to more natural and less repetitive surface realisation. It also allows generation from partial and modified inputs and is therefore applicable to incremental surface realisation. Results from a human rating study confirm that users are sensitive to this extended notion of context and assign ratings that are significantly higher (up to 14%) than those for taking only local context into account.</p><p>4 0.26194069 <a title="168-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Discriminative_state_tracking_for_spoken_dialog_systems.html">124 acl-2013-Discriminative state tracking for spoken dialog systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Angeliki Metallinou ; Dan Bohus ; Jason Williams</p><p>Abstract: In spoken dialog systems, statistical state tracking aims to improve robustness to speech recognition errors by tracking a posterior distribution over hidden dialog states. Current approaches based on generative or discriminative models have different but important shortcomings that limit their accuracy. In this paper we discuss these limitations and introduce a new approach for discriminative state tracking that overcomes them by leveraging the problem structure. An offline evaluation with dialog data collected from real users shows improvements in both state tracking accuracy and the quality of the posterior probabilities. Features that encode speech recognition error patterns are particularly helpful, and training requires rel- atively few dialogs.</p><p>5 0.22599681 <a title="168-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-A_Bayesian_Model_for_Joint_Unsupervised_Induction_of_Sentiment%2C_Aspect_and_Discourse_Representations.html">2 acl-2013-A Bayesian Model for Joint Unsupervised Induction of Sentiment, Aspect and Discourse Representations</a></p>
<p>Author: Angeliki Lazaridou ; Ivan Titov ; Caroline Sporleder</p><p>Abstract: We propose a joint model for unsupervised induction of sentiment, aspect and discourse information and show that by incorporating a notion of latent discourse relations in the model, we improve the prediction accuracy for aspect and sentiment polarity on the sub-sentential level. We deviate from the traditional view of discourse, as we induce types of discourse relations and associated discourse cues relevant to the considered opinion analysis task; consequently, the induced discourse relations play the role of opinion and aspect shifters. The quantitative analysis that we conducted indicated that the integration of a discourse model increased the prediction accuracy results with respect to the discourse-agnostic approach and the qualitative analysis suggests that the induced representations encode a meaningful discourse structure.</p><p>6 0.21244743 <a title="168-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Sentiment_Relevance.html">318 acl-2013-Sentiment Relevance</a></p>

<p>Author: Srinivasan Janarthanam ; Oliver Lemon ; Phil Bartie ; Tiphaine Dalmas ; Anna Dickinson ; Xingkun Liu ; William Mackaness ; Bonnie Webber</p><p>Abstract: We present a city navigation and tourist information mobile dialogue app with integrated question-answering (QA) and geographic information system (GIS) modules that helps pedestrian users to navigate in and learn about urban environments. In contrast to existing mobile apps which treat these problems independently, our Android app addresses the problem of navigation and touristic questionanswering in an integrated fashion using a shared dialogue context. We evaluated our system in comparison with Samsung S-Voice (which interfaces to Google navigation and Google search) with 17 users and found that users judged our system to be significantly more interesting to interact with and learn from. They also rated our system above Google search (with the Samsung S-Voice interface) for tourist information tasks.</p><p>6 0.51769263 <a title="168-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Character-to-Character_Sentiment_Analysis_in_Shakespeare%27s_Plays.html">79 acl-2013-Character-to-Character Sentiment Analysis in Shakespeare's Plays</a></p>

<p>Author: Jiwei Li ; Sujian Li</p><p>Abstract: Timeline summarization aims at generating concise summaries and giving readers a faster and better access to understand the evolution of news. It is a new challenge which combines salience ranking problem with novelty detection. Previous researches in this field seldom explore the evolutionary pattern of topics such as birth, splitting, merging, developing and death. In this paper, we develop a novel model called Evolutionary Hierarchical Dirichlet Process(EHDP) to capture the topic evolution pattern in time- line summarization. In EHDP, time varying information is formulated as a series of HDPs by considering time-dependent information. Experiments on 6 different datasets which contain 3 156 documents demonstrates the good performance of our system with regard to ROUGE scores.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.88485301 <a title="168-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Generating_Recommendation_Dialogs_by_Extracting_Information_from_User_Reviews.html">168 acl-2013-Generating Recommendation Dialogs by Extracting Information from User Reviews</a></p>

<p>Author: Adrien Barbaresi</p><p>Abstract: We present a way to extract links from messages published on microblogging platforms and we classify them according to the language and possible relevance of their target in order to build a text corpus. Three platforms are taken into consideration: FriendFeed, identi.ca and Reddit, as they account for a relative diversity of user profiles and more importantly user languages. In order to explore them, we introduce a traversal algorithm based on user pages. As we target lesser-known languages, we try to focus on non-English posts by filtering out English text. Using mature open-source software from the NLP research field, a spell checker (as- pell) and a language identification system (langid .py), our case study and our benchmarks give an insight into the linguistic structure of the considered services.</p><p>4 0.84187663 <a title="168-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-The_Role_of_Syntax_in_Vector_Space_Models_of_Compositional_Semantics.html">347 acl-2013-The Role of Syntax in Vector Space Models of Compositional Semantics</a></p>
<p>Author: Karl Moritz Hermann ; Phil Blunsom</p><p>Abstract: Modelling the compositional process by which the meaning of an utterance arises from the meaning of its parts is a fundamental task of Natural Language Processing. In this paper we draw upon recent advances in the learning of vector space representations of sentential semantics and the transparent interface between syntax and semantics provided by Combinatory Categorial Grammar to introduce Combinatory Categorial Autoencoders. This model leverages the CCG combinatory operators to guide a non-linear transformation of meaning within a sentence. We use this model to learn high dimensional embeddings for sentences and evaluate them in a range of tasks, demonstrating that the incorporation of syntax allows a concise model to learn representations that are both effective and general.</p><p>5 0.84000427 <a title="168-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Exploring_Sentiment_in_Social_Media%3A_Bootstrapping_Subjectivity_Clues_from_Multilingual_Twitter_Streams.html">148 acl-2013-Exploring Sentiment in Social Media: Bootstrapping Subjectivity Clues from Multilingual Twitter Streams</a></p>
<p>Author: Svitlana Volkova ; Theresa Wilson ; David Yarowsky</p><p>Abstract: We study subjective language media and create Twitter-specific lexicons via bootstrapping sentiment-bearing terms from multilingual Twitter streams. Starting with a domain-independent, highprecision sentiment lexicon and a large pool of unlabeled data, we bootstrap Twitter-specific sentiment lexicons, using a small amount of labeled data to guide the process. Our experiments on English, Spanish and Russian show that the resulting lexicons are effective for sentiment classification for many underexplored languages in social media.</p><p>6 0.83979064 <a title="168-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Generalizing_Image_Captions_for_Image-Text_Parallel_Corpus.html">167 acl-2013-Generalizing Image Captions for Image-Text Parallel Corpus</a></p>

<p>Author: Xuchen Yao ; Benjamin Van Durme ; Peter Clark</p><p>Abstract: Information Retrieval (IR) and Answer Extraction are often designed as isolated or loosely connected components in Question Answering (QA), with repeated overengineering on IR, and not necessarily performance gain for QA. We propose to tightly integrate them by coupling automatically learned features for answer extraction to a shallow-structured IR model. Our method is very quick to implement, and significantly improves IR for QA (measured in Mean Average Precision and Mean Reciprocal Rank) by 10%-20% against an uncoupled retrieval baseline in both document and passage retrieval, which further leads to a downstream 20% improvement in QA F1.</p><p>3 0.2781696 <a title="241-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Deceptive_Answer_Prediction_with_User_Preference_Graph.html">107 acl-2013-Deceptive Answer Prediction with User Preference Graph</a></p>
<p>Author: Fangtao Li ; Yang Gao ; Shuchang Zhou ; Xiance Si ; Decheng Dai</p><p>Abstract: In Community question answering (QA) sites, malicious users may provide deceptive answers to promote their products or services. It is important to identify and filter out these deceptive answers. In this paper, we first solve this problem with the traditional supervised learning methods. Two kinds of features, including textual and contextual features, are investigated for this task. We further propose to exploit the user relationships to identify the deceptive answers, based on the hypothesis that similar users will have similar behaviors to post deceptive or authentic answers. To measure the user similarity, we propose a new user preference graph based on the answer preference expressed by users, such as “helpful” voting and “best answer” selection. The user preference graph is incorporated into traditional supervised learning framework with the graph regularization technique. The experiment results demonstrate that the user preference graph can indeed help improve the performance of deceptive answer prediction.</p><p>4 0.23307957 <a title="241-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Question_Answering_Using_Enhanced_Lexical_Semantic_Models.html">291 acl-2013-Question Answering Using Enhanced Lexical Semantic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Wen-tau Yih ; Ming-Wei Chang ; Christopher Meek ; Andrzej Pastusiak</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the answer sentence selection problem for question answering. Unlike previous work, which primarily leverages syntactic analysis through dependency tree matching, we focus on improving the performance using models of lexical semantic resources. Experiments show that our systems can be consistently and significantly improved with rich lexical semantic information, regardless of the choice of learning algorithms. When evaluated on a benchmark dataset, the MAP and MRR scores are increased by 8 to 10 points, compared to one of our baseline systems using only surface-form matching. Moreover, our best system also outperforms pervious work that makes use of the dependency tree structure by a wide margin.</p><p>5 0.21530442 <a title="241-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Question_Classification_Transfer.html">292 acl-2013-Question Classification Transfer</a></p>
<p>Author: Anne-Laure Ligozat</p><p>Abstract: Question answering systems have been developed for many languages, but most resources were created for English, which can be a problem when developing a system in another language such as French. In particular, for question classification, no labeled question corpus is available for French, so this paper studies the possibility to use existing English corpora and transfer a classification by translating the question and their labels. By translating the training corpus, we obtain results close to a monolingual setting.</p><p>6 0.14064813 <a title="241-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Paraphrase-Driven_Learning_for_Open_Question_Answering.html">272 acl-2013-Paraphrase-Driven Learning for Open Question Answering</a></p>

<p>Author: Kevin Knight</p><p>Abstract: The first natural language processing systems had a straightforward goal: decipher coded messages sent by the enemy. This tutorial explores connections between early decipherment research and today’s NLP work. We cover classic military and diplomatic ciphers, automatic decipherment algorithms, unsolved ciphers, language translation as decipherment, and analyzing ancient writing as decipherment. 1 Tutorial Overview The first natural language processing systems had a straightforward goal: decipher coded messages sent by the enemy. Sixty years later, we have many more applications, including web search, question answering, summarization, speech recognition, and language translation. This tutorial explores connections between early decipherment research and today’s NLP work. We find that many ideas from the earlier era have become core to the field, while others still remain to be picked up and developed. We first cover classic military and diplomatic cipher types, including complex substitution ciphers implemented in the first electro-mechanical encryption machines. We look at mathematical tools (language recognition, frequency counting, smoothing) developed to decrypt such ciphers on proto-computers. We show algorithms and extensive empirical results for solving different types of ciphers, and we show the role of algorithms in recent decipherments of historical documents. We then look at how foreign language can be viewed as a code for English, a concept developed by Alan Turing and Warren Weaver. We describe recently published work on building automatic translation systems from non-parallel data. We also demonstrate how some of the same algorithmic tools can be applied to natural language tasks like part-of-speech tagging and word alignment. Turning back to historical ciphers, we explore a number of unsolved ciphers, giving results of initial computer experiments on several of them. Finally, we look briefly at writing as a way to encipher phoneme sequences, covering ancient scripts and modern applications. 2 Outline 1.

<p>Author: Zhengyan He ; Shujie Liu ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou ; Longkai Zhang ; Houfeng Wang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel entity disambiguation model, based on Deep Neural Network (DNN). Instead of utilizing simple similarity measures and their disjoint combinations, our method directly optimizes document and entity representations for a given similarity measure. Stacked Denoising Auto-encoders are first employed to learn an initial document representation in an unsupervised pre-training stage. A supervised fine-tuning stage follows to optimize the representation towards the similarity measure. Experiment results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets without any manually designed features, even beating complex collective approaches.</p><p>4 0.99779427 <a title="241-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-A_Two_Level_Model_for_Context_Sensitive_Inference_Rules.html">27 acl-2013-A Two Level Model for Context Sensitive Inference Rules</a></p>
<p>Author: Oren Melamud ; Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan ; Jacob Goldberger ; Idan Szpektor</p><p>Abstract: Automatic acquisition of inference rules for predicates has been commonly addressed by computing distributional similarity between vectors of argument words, operating at the word space level. A recent line of work, which addresses context sensitivity of rules, represented contexts in a latent topic space and computed similarity over topic vectors. We propose a novel two-level model, which computes similarities between word-level vectors that are biased by topic-level context representations. Evaluations on a naturallydistributed dataset show that our model significantly outperforms prior word-level and topic-level models. We also release a first context-sensitive inference rule set.</p><p>5 0.99741697 <a title="241-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Unsupervised_Consonant-Vowel_Prediction_over_Hundreds_of_Languages.html">369 acl-2013-Unsupervised Consonant-Vowel Prediction over Hundreds of Languages</a></p>
<p>Author: Young-Bum Kim ; Benjamin Snyder</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a solution to one aspect of the decipherment task: the prediction of consonants and vowels for an unknown language and alphabet. Adopting a classical Bayesian perspective, we performs posterior inference over hundreds of languages, leveraging knowledge of known languages and alphabets to uncover general linguistic patterns of typologically coherent language clusters. We achieve average accuracy in the unsupervised consonant/vowel prediction task of 99% across 503 languages. We further show that our methodology can be used to predict more fine-grained phonetic distinctions. On a three-way classification task between vowels, nasals, and nonnasal consonants, our model yields unsu- pervised accuracy of 89% across the same set of languages.</p><p>same-paper 6 0.99739617 <a title="241-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Minimum_Bayes_Risk_based_Answer_Re-ranking_for_Question_Answering.html">241 acl-2013-Minimum Bayes Risk based Answer Re-ranking for Question Answering</a></p>

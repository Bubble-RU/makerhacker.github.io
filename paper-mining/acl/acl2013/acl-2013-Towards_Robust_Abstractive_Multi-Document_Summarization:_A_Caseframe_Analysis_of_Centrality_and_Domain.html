<p>Author: Peter A. Rankel ; John M. Conroy ; Hoa Trang Dang ; Ani Nenkova</p><p>Abstract: How good are automatic content metrics for news summary evaluation? Here we provide a detailed answer to this question, with a particular focus on assessing the ability of automatic evaluations to identify statistically significant differences present in manual evaluation of content. Using four years of data from the Text Analysis Conference, we analyze the performance of eight ROUGE variants in terms of accuracy, precision and recall in finding significantly different systems. Our experiments show that some of the neglected variants of ROUGE, based on higher order n-grams and syntactic dependencies, are most accurate across the years; the commonly used ROUGE-1 scores find too many significant differences between systems which manual evaluation would deem comparable. We also test combinations ofROUGE variants and find that they considerably improve the accuracy of automatic prediction.</p><p>3 0.095499612 <a title="353-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Probabilistic_Domain_Modelling_With_Contextualized_Distributional_Semantic_Vectors.html">283 acl-2013-Probabilistic Domain Modelling With Contextualized Distributional Semantic Vectors</a></p>
<p>Author: Jackie Chi Kit Cheung ; Gerald Penn</p><p>Abstract: Generative probabilistic models have been used for content modelling and template induction, and are typically trained on small corpora in the target domain. In contrast, vector space models of distributional semantics are trained on large corpora, but are typically applied to domaingeneral lexical disambiguation tasks. We introduce Distributional Semantic Hidden Markov Models, a novel variant of a hidden Markov model that integrates these two approaches by incorporating contextualized distributional semantic vectors into a generative model as observed emissions. Experiments in slot induction show that our approach yields improvements in learning coherent entity clusters in a domain. In a subsequent extrinsic evaluation, we show that these improvements are also reflected in multi-document summarization.</p><p>4 0.08913967 <a title="353-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Fast_and_Robust_Compressive_Summarization_with_Dual_Decomposition_and_Multi-Task_Learning.html">157 acl-2013-Fast and Robust Compressive Summarization with Dual Decomposition and Multi-Task Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Miguel Almeida ; Andre Martins</p><p>Abstract: We present a dual decomposition framework for multi-document summarization, using a model that jointly extracts and compresses sentences. Compared with previous work based on integer linear programming, our approach does not require external solvers, is significantly faster, and is modular in the three qualities a summary should have: conciseness, informativeness, and grammaticality. In addition, we propose a multi-task learning framework to take advantage of existing data for extractive summarization and sentence compression. Experiments in the TAC2008 dataset yield the highest published ROUGE scores to date, with runtimes that rival those of extractive summarizers.</p><p>5 0.088870913 <a title="353-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-A_Sentence_Compression_Based_Framework_to_Query-Focused_Multi-Document_Summarization.html">18 acl-2013-A Sentence Compression Based Framework to Query-Focused Multi-Document Summarization</a></p>
<p>Author: Lu Wang ; Hema Raghavan ; Vittorio Castelli ; Radu Florian ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of using sentence compression techniques to facilitate queryfocused multi-document summarization. We present a sentence-compression-based framework for the task, and design a series of learning-based compression models built on parse trees. An innovative beam search decoder is proposed to efficiently find highly probable compressions. Under this framework, we show how to integrate various indicative metrics such as linguistic motivation and query relevance into the compression process by deriving a novel formulation of a compression scoring function. Our best model achieves statistically significant improvement over the state-of-the-art systems on several metrics (e.g. 8.0% and 5.4% improvements in ROUGE-2 respectively) for the DUC 2006 and 2007 summarization task. ,</p><p>6 0.075153463 <a title="353-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Domain-Independent_Abstract_Generation_for_Focused_Meeting_Summarization.html">129 acl-2013-Domain-Independent Abstract Generation for Focused Meeting Summarization</a></p>

<p>Author: Chen Li ; Xian Qian ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a bigram based supervised method for extractive document summarization in the integer linear programming (ILP) framework. For each bigram, a regression model is used to estimate its frequency in the reference summary. The regression model uses a variety ofindicative features and is trained discriminatively to minimize the distance between the estimated and the ground truth bigram frequency in the reference summary. During testing, the sentence selection problem is formulated as an ILP problem to maximize the bigram gains. We demonstrate that our system consistently outperforms the previous ILP method on different TAC data sets, and performs competitively compared to the best results in the TAC evaluations. We also conducted various analysis to show the impact of bigram selection, weight estimation, and ILP setup.</p><p>4 0.73011458 <a title="353-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Summarization_Through_Submodularity_and_Dispersion.html">333 acl-2013-Summarization Through Submodularity and Dispersion</a></p>
<p>Author: Anirban Dasgupta ; Ravi Kumar ; Sujith Ravi</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new optimization framework for summarization by generalizing the submodular framework of (Lin and Bilmes, 2011). In our framework the summarization desideratum is expressed as a sum of a submodular function and a nonsubmodular function, which we call dispersion; the latter uses inter-sentence dissimilarities in different ways in order to ensure non-redundancy of the summary. We consider three natural dispersion functions and show that a greedy algorithm can obtain an approximately optimal summary in all three cases. We conduct experiments on two corpora—DUC 2004 and user comments on news articles—and show that the performance of our algorithm outperforms those that rely only on submodularity.</p><p>5 0.72305161 <a title="353-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Domain-Independent_Abstract_Generation_for_Focused_Meeting_Summarization.html">129 acl-2013-Domain-Independent Abstract Generation for Focused Meeting Summarization</a></p>
<p>Author: Lu Wang ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: We address the challenge of generating natural language abstractive summaries for spoken meetings in a domain-independent fashion. We apply Multiple-Sequence Alignment to induce abstract generation templates that can be used for different domains. An Overgenerateand-Rank strategy is utilized to produce and rank candidate abstracts. Experiments using in-domain and out-of-domain training on disparate corpora show that our system uniformly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised extract-based approaches. In addition, human judges rate our system summaries significantly higher than compared systems in fluency and overall quality.</p><p>6 0.70185035 <a title="353-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Automated_Pyramid_Scoring_of_Summaries_using_Distributional_Semantics.html">59 acl-2013-Automated Pyramid Scoring of Summaries using Distributional Semantics</a></p>

<p>Author: Nadir Durrani ; Alexander Fraser ; Helmut Schmid ; Hieu Hoang ; Philipp Koehn</p><p>Abstract: The phrase-based and N-gram-based SMT frameworks complement each other. While the former is better able to memorize, the latter provides a more principled model that captures dependencies across phrasal boundaries. Some work has been done to combine insights from these two frameworks. A recent successful attempt showed the advantage of using phrasebased search on top of an N-gram-based model. We probe this question in the reverse direction by investigating whether integrating N-gram-based translation and reordering models into a phrase-based decoder helps overcome the problematic phrasal independence assumption. A large scale evaluation over 8 language pairs shows that performance does significantly improve.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.81029171 <a title="353-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Towards_Robust_Abstractive_Multi-Document_Summarization%3A_A_Caseframe_Analysis_of_Centrality_and_Domain.html">353 acl-2013-Towards Robust Abstractive Multi-Document Summarization: A Caseframe Analysis of Centrality and Domain</a></p>

<p>Author: Adam Vogel ; Christopher Potts ; Dan Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: Conversational implicatures involve reasoning about multiply nested belief structures. This complexity poses significant challenges for computational models of conversation and cognition. We show that agents in the multi-agent DecentralizedPOMDP reach implicature-rich interpretations simply as a by-product of the way they reason about each other to maximize joint utility. Our simulations involve a reference game of the sort studied in psychology and linguistics as well as a dynamic, interactional scenario involving implemented artificial agents.</p><p>5 0.76678163 <a title="353-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Multilingual_Affect_Polarity_and_Valence_Prediction_in_Metaphor-Rich_Texts.html">253 acl-2013-Multilingual Affect Polarity and Valence Prediction in Metaphor-Rich Texts</a></p>
<p>Author: Zornitsa Kozareva</p><p>Abstract: Metaphor is an important way of conveying the affect of people, hence understanding how people use metaphors to convey affect is important for the communication between individuals and increases cohesion if the perceived affect of the concrete example is the same for the two individuals. Therefore, building computational models that can automatically identify the affect in metaphor-rich texts like “The team captain is a rock.”, “Time is money.”, “My lawyer is a shark.” is an important challenging problem, which has been of great interest to the research community. To solve this task, we have collected and manually annotated the affect of metaphor-rich texts for four languages. We present novel algorithms that integrate triggers for cognitive, affective, perceptual and social processes with stylistic and lexical information. By running evaluations on datasets in English, Spanish, Russian and Farsi, we show that the developed affect polarity and valence prediction technology of metaphor-rich texts is portable and works equally well for different languages.</p><p>6 0.76635349 <a title="353-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Mapping_Source_to_Target_Strings_without_Alignment_by_Analogical_Learning%3A_A_Case_Study_with_Transliteration.html">236 acl-2013-Mapping Source to Target Strings without Alignment by Analogical Learning: A Case Study with Transliteration</a></p>

<p>Author: Peifeng Li ; Qiaoming Zhu ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: As a paratactic language, sentence-level argument extraction in Chinese suffers much from the frequent occurrence of ellipsis with regard to inter-sentence arguments. To resolve such problem, this paper proposes a novel global argument inference model to explore specific relationships, such as Coreference, Sequence and Parallel, among relevant event mentions to recover those intersentence arguments in the sentence, discourse and document layers which represent the cohesion of an event or a topic. Evaluation on the ACE 2005 Chinese corpus justifies the effectiveness of our global argument inference model over a state-of-the-art baseline. 1</p><p>3 0.23066594 <a title="69-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Joint_Event_Extraction_via_Structured_Prediction_with_Global_Features.html">206 acl-2013-Joint Event Extraction via Structured Prediction with Global Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Qi Li ; Heng Ji ; Liang Huang</p><p>Abstract: Traditional approaches to the task of ACE event extraction usually rely on sequential pipelines with multiple stages, which suffer from error propagation since event triggers and arguments are predicted in isolation by independent local classifiers. By contrast, we propose a joint framework based on structured prediction which extracts triggers and arguments together so that the local predictions can be mutually improved. In addition, we propose to incorporate global features which explicitly capture the dependencies of multiple triggers and arguments. Experimental results show that our joint approach with local features outperforms the pipelined baseline, and adding global features further improves the performance significantly. Our approach advances state-ofthe-art sentence-level event extraction, and even outperforms previous argument labeling methods which use external knowledge from other sentences and documents.</p><p>4 0.19873343 <a title="69-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-What_causes_a_causal_relation%3F_Detecting_Causal_Triggers_in_Biomedical_Scientific_Discourse.html">386 acl-2013-What causes a causal relation? Detecting Causal Triggers in Biomedical Scientific Discourse</a></p>
<p>Author: Claudiu Mihaila ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: Current domain-specific information extraction systems represent an important resource for biomedical researchers, who need to process vaster amounts of knowledge in short times. Automatic discourse causality recognition can further improve their workload by suggesting possible causal connections and aiding in the curation of pathway models. We here describe an approach to the automatic identification of discourse causality triggers in the biomedical domain using machine learning. We create several baselines and experiment with various parameter settings for three algorithms, i.e., Conditional Random Fields (CRF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF). Also, we evaluate the impact of lexical, syntactic and semantic features on each of the algorithms and look at er- rors. The best performance of 79.35% F-score is achieved by CRFs when using all three feature types.</p><p>5 0.10842697 <a title="69-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Word_Association_Profiles_and_their_Use_for_Automated_Scoring_of_Essays.html">389 acl-2013-Word Association Profiles and their Use for Automated Scoring of Essays</a></p>
<p>Author: Beata Beigman Klebanov ; Michael Flor</p><p>Abstract: We describe a new representation of the content vocabulary of a text we call word association profile that captures the proportions of highly associated, mildly associated, unassociated, and dis-associated pairs of words that co-exist in the given text. We illustrate the shape of the distirbution and observe variation with genre and target audience. We present a study of the relationship between quality of writing and word association profiles. For a set of essays written by college graduates on a number of general topics, we show that the higher scoring essays tend to have higher percentages of both highly associated and dis-associated pairs, and lower percentages of mildly associated pairs of words. Finally, we use word association profiles to improve a system for automated scoring of essays.</p><p>6 0.10768008 <a title="69-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Broadcast_News_Story_Segmentation_Using_Manifold_Learning_on_Latent_Topic_Distributions.html">73 acl-2013-Broadcast News Story Segmentation Using Manifold Learning on Latent Topic Distributions</a></p>

<p>Author: Tze Yuang Chong ; Rafael E. Banchs ; Eng Siong Chng ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of distance and co-occurrence information of word-pairs for language modeling. We attempt to extract this information from history-contexts of up to ten words in size, and found it complements well the n-gram model, which inherently suffers from data scarcity in learning long history-contexts. Evaluated on the WSJ corpus, bigram and trigram model perplexity were reduced up to 23.5% and 14.0%, respectively. Compared to the distant bigram, we show that word-pairs can be more effectively modeled in terms of both distance and occurrence. 1</p><p>6 0.32279187 <a title="69-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Vector_Space_Model_for_Adaptation_in_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">383 acl-2013-Vector Space Model for Adaptation in Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Song Feng ; Jun Seok Kang ; Polina Kuznetsova ; Yejin Choi</p><p>Abstract: Understanding the connotation of words plays an important role in interpreting subtle shades of sentiment beyond denotative or surface meaning of text, as seemingly objective statements often allude nuanced sentiment of the writer, and even purposefully conjure emotion from the readers’ minds. The focus of this paper is drawing nuanced, connotative sentiments from even those words that are objective on the surface, such as “intelligence ”, “human ”, and “cheesecake ”. We propose induction algorithms encoding a diverse set of linguistic insights (semantic prosody, distributional similarity, semantic parallelism of coordination) and prior knowledge drawn from lexical resources, resulting in the first broad-coverage connotation lexicon.</p><p>2 0.85115778 <a title="69-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Temporal_Signals_Help_Label_Temporal_Relations.html">339 acl-2013-Temporal Signals Help Label Temporal Relations</a></p>
<p>Author: Leon Derczynski ; Robert Gaizauskas</p><p>Abstract: Automatically determining the temporal order of events and times in a text is difficult, though humans can readily perform this task. Sometimes events and times are related through use of an explicit co-ordination which gives information about the temporal relation: expressions like “before ” and “as soon as”. We investigate the r oˆle that these co-ordinating temporal signals have in determining the type of temporal relations in discourse. Using machine learning, we improve upon prior approaches to the problem, achieving over 80% accuracy at labelling the types of temporal relation between events and times that are related by temporal signals.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.82976753 <a title="69-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Bilingual_Lexical_Cohesion_Trigger_Model_for_Document-Level_Machine_Translation.html">69 acl-2013-Bilingual Lexical Cohesion Trigger Model for Document-Level Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Kang Liu ; Liheng Xu ; Jun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: Mining opinion targets is a fundamental and important task for opinion mining from online reviews. To this end, there are usually two kinds of methods: syntax based and alignment based methods. Syntax based methods usually exploited syntactic patterns to extract opinion targets, which were however prone to suffer from parsing errors when dealing with online informal texts. In contrast, alignment based methods used word alignment model to fulfill this task, which could avoid parsing errors without using parsing. However, there is no research focusing on which kind of method is more better when given a certain amount of reviews. To fill this gap, this paper empiri- cally studies how the performance of these two kinds of methods vary when changing the size, domain and language of the corpus. We further combine syntactic patterns with alignment model by using a partially supervised framework and investigate whether this combination is useful or not. In our experiments, we verify that our combination is effective on the corpus with small and medium size.</p><p>5 0.80069202 <a title="69-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Mining_Opinion_Words_and_Opinion_Targets_in_a_Two-Stage_Framework.html">244 acl-2013-Mining Opinion Words and Opinion Targets in a Two-Stage Framework</a></p>
<p>Author: Liheng Xu ; Kang Liu ; Siwei Lai ; Yubo Chen ; Jun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel two-stage method for mining opinion words and opinion targets. In the first stage, we propose a Sentiment Graph Walking algorithm, which naturally incorporates syntactic patterns in a Sentiment Graph to extract opinion word/target candidates. Then random walking is employed to estimate confidence of candidates, which improves extraction accuracy by considering confidence of patterns. In the second stage, we adopt a self-learning strategy to refine the results from the first stage, especially for filtering out high-frequency noise terms and capturing the long-tail terms, which are not investigated by previous methods. The experimental results on three real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared with stateof-the-art unsupervised methods.</p><p>6 0.79873401 <a title="69-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Typesetting_for_Improved_Readability_using_Lexical_and_Syntactic_Information.html">364 acl-2013-Typesetting for Improved Readability using Lexical and Syntactic Information</a></p>

<h1>323 acl-2013-Simpler unsupervised POS tagging with bilingual projections</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-323-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-2112.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Long Duong ; Paul Cook ; Steven Bird ; Pavel Pecina</p><p>Abstract: We present an unsupervised approach to part-of-speech tagging based on projections of tags in a word-aligned bilingual parallel corpus. In contrast to the existing state-of-the-art approach of Das and Petrov, we have developed a substantially simpler method by automatically identifying “good” training sentences from the parallel corpus and applying self-training. In experimental results on eight languages, our method achieves state-of-the-art results. 1 Unsupervised part-of-speech tagging Currently, part-of-speech (POS) taggers are available for many highly spoken and well-resourced languages such as English, French, German, Italian, and Arabic. For example, Petrov et al. (2012) build supervised POS taggers for 22 languages using the TNT tagger (Brants, 2000), with an average accuracy of 95.2%. However, many widelyspoken languages including Bengali, Javanese, and Lahnda have little data manually labelled for POS, limiting supervised approaches to POS tagging for these languages. However, with the growing quantity of text available online, and in particular, multilingual parallel texts from sources such as multilingual websites, government documents and large archives ofhuman translations ofbooks, news, and so forth, unannotated parallel data is becoming more widely available. This parallel data can be exploited to bridge languages, and in particular, transfer information from a highly-resourced language to a lesser-resourced language, to build unsupervised POS taggers. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to POS tagging in a similar vein to the work of Das and Petrov (201 1). In this approach, — — pecina@ ufal .mff .cuni . c z a parallel corpus for a more-resourced language having a POS tagger, and a lesser-resourced language, is word-aligned. These alignments are exploited to infer an unsupervised tagger for the target language (i.e., a tagger not requiring manuallylabelled data in the target language). Our approach is substantially simpler than that of Das and Petrov, the current state-of-the art, yet performs comparably well. 2 Related work There is a wealth of prior research on building unsupervised POS taggers. Some approaches have exploited similarities between typologically similar languages (e.g., Czech and Russian, or Telugu and Kannada) to estimate the transition probabilities for an HMM tagger for one language based on a corpus for another language (e.g., Hana et al., 2004; Feldman et al., 2006; Reddy and Sharoff, 2011). Other approaches have simultaneously tagged two languages based on alignments in a parallel corpus (e.g., Snyder et al., 2008). A number of studies have used tag projection to copy tag information from a resource-rich to a resource-poor language, based on word alignments in a parallel corpus. After alignment, the resource-rich language is tagged, and tags are projected from the source language to the target language based on the alignment (e.g., Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001 ; Das and Petrov, 2011). Das and Petrov (201 1) achieved the current state-of-the-art for unsupervised tagging by exploiting high confidence alignments to copy tags from the source language to the target language. Graph-based label propagation was used to automatically produce more labelled training data. First, a graph was constructed in which each vertex corresponds to a unique trigram, and edge weights represent the syntactic similarity between vertices. Labels were then propagated by optimizing a convex function to favor the same tags for closely related nodes 634 Proce dingSsof oifa, th Beu 5l1gsarti Aan,An u aglu Mste 4e-ti9n2g 0 o1f3 t.he ?c A2s0s1o3ci Aatsiosonc fioartio Cno fmorpu Ctoamtiopnuatalt Lioin gauli Lsitnicgsu,i psatgices 634–639, ModelCoverageAccuracy Many-to-1 alignments88%68% 1-to-1 alignments 68% 78% 1-to-1 alignments: Top 60k sents 91% 80% Table 1: Token coverage and accuracy of manyto-one and 1-to-1 alignments, as well as the top 60k sentences based on alignment score for 1-to-1 alignments, using directly-projected labels only. while keeping a uniform tag distribution for unrelated nodes. A tag dictionary was then extracted from the automatically labelled data, and this was used to constrain a feature-based HMM tagger. The method we propose here is simpler to that of Das and Petrov in that it does not require convex optimization for label propagation or a feature based HMM, yet it achieves comparable results. 3 Tagset Our tagger exploits the idea ofprojecting tag information from a resource-rich to resource-poor language. To facilitate this mapping, we adopt Petrov et al.’s (2012) twelve universal tags: NOUN, VERB, ADJ, ADV, PRON (pronouns), DET (de- terminers and articles), ADP (prepositions and postpositions), NUM (numerals), CONJ (conjunctions), PRT (particles), “.” (punctuation), and X (all other categories, e.g., foreign words, abbreviations). These twelve basic tags are common across taggers for most languages. Adopting a universal tagset avoids the need to map between a variety of different, languagespecific tagsets. Furthermore, it makes it possible to apply unsupervised tagging methods to languages for which no tagset is available, such as Telugu and Vietnamese. 4 A Simpler Unsupervised POS Tagger Here we describe our proposed tagger. The key idea is to maximize the amount of information gleaned from the source language, while limiting the amount of noise. We describe the seed model and then explain how it is successively refined through self-training and revision. 4.1 Seed Model The first step is to construct a seed tagger from directly-projected labels. Given a parallel corpus for a source and target language, Algorithm 1provides a method for building an unsupervised tagger for the target language. In typical applications, the source language would be a better-resourced language having a tagger, while the target language would be lesser-resourced, lacking a tagger and large amounts of manually POS-labelled data. Algorithm 1 Build seed model Algorithm 1Build seed model 1:Tag source side. 2: Word align the corpus with Giza++ and remove the many-to-one mappings. 3: Project tags from source to target using the remaining 1-to-1 alignments. 4: Select the top n sentences based on sentence alignment score. 5: Estimate emission and transition probabilities. 6: Build seed tagger T. We eliminate many-to-one alignments (Step 2). Keeping these would give more POS-tagged tokens for the target side, but also introduce noise. For example, suppose English and French were the source and target language, respectively. In this case alignments such as English laws (NNS) to French les (DT) lois (NNS) would be expected (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001). However, in Step 3, where tags are projected from the source to target language, this would incorrectly tag French les as NN. We build a French tagger based on English– French data from the Europarl Corpus (Koehn, 2005). We also compare the accuracy and coverage of the tags obtained through direct projection using the French Melt POS tagger (Denis and Sagot, 2009). Table 1confirms that the one-to-one alignments indeed give higher accuracy but lower coverage than the many-to-one alignments. At this stage of the model we hypothesize that highconfidence tags are important, and hence eliminate the many-to-one alignments. In Step 4, in an effort to again obtain higher quality target language tags from direct projection, we eliminate all but the top n sentences based on their alignment scores, as provided by the aligner via IBM model 3. We heuristically set this cutoff × to 60k to balance the accuracy and size of the seed model.1 Returning to our preliminary English– French experiments in Table 1, this process gives improvements in both accuracy and coverage.2 1We considered values in the range 60–90k, but this choice had little impact on the accuracy of the model. 2We also considered using all projected labels for the top 60k sentences, not just 1-to-1 alignments, but in preliminary experiments this did not perform as well, possibly due to the previously-observed problems with many-to-one alignments. 635 The number of parameters for the emission probability is |V | |T| where V is the vocabulary and aTb iilsi ttyh eis tag |s e×t. TTh| ew htrearnesi Vtio ins probability, on atnhed other hand, has only |T|3 parameters for the trigram hmaondde,l we use. TB|ecause of this difference in number of parameters, in step 5, we use different strategies to estimate the emission and transition probabilities. The emission probability is estimated from all 60k selected sentences. However, for the transition probability, which has less parameters, we again focus on “better” sentences, by estimating this probability from only those sen- tences that have (1) token coverage > 90% (based on direct projection of tags from the source language), and (2) length > 4 tokens. These criteria aim to identify longer, mostly-tagged sentences, which we hypothesize are particularly useful as training data. In the case of our preliminary English–French experiments, roughly 62% of the 60k selected sentences meet these criteria and are used to estimate the transition probability. For unaligned words, we simply assign a random POS and very low probability, which does not substantially affect transition probability estimates. In Step 6 we build a tagger by feeding the estimated emission and transition probabilities into the TNT tagger (Brants, 2000), an implementation of a trigram HMM tagger. 4.2 Self training and revision For self training and revision, we use the seed model, along with the large number of target language sentences available that have been partially tagged through direct projection, in order to build a more accurate tagger. Algorithm 2 describes this process of self training and revision, and assumes that the parallel source–target corpus has been word aligned, with many-to-one alignments removed, and that the sentences are sorted by alignment score. In contrast to Algorithm 1, all sentences are used, not just the 60k sentences with the highest alignment scores. We believe that sentence alignment score might correspond to difficulty to tag. By sorting the sentences by alignment score, sentences which are more difficult to tag are tagged using a more mature model. Following Algorithm 1, we divide sentences into blocks of 60k. In step 3 the tagged block is revised by comparing the tags from the tagger with those obtained through direct projection. Suppose source Algorithm 2 Self training and revision 1:Divide target language sentences into blocks of n sentences. 2: Tag the first block with the seed tagger. 3: Revise the tagged block. 4: Train a new tagger on the tagged block. 5: Add the previous tagger’s lexicon to the new tagger. 6: Use the new tagger to tag the next block. 7: Goto 3 and repeat until all blocks are tagged. language word wis is aligned with target language word wjt with probability p(wjt |wsi), Tis is the tag for wis using the tagger availa|bwle for the source language, and Tjt is the tag for wjt using the tagger learned for the > S, where S is a threshold which we heuristically set to 0.7, we replace Tjt by Tis. Self-training can suffer from over-fitting, in which errors in the original model are repeated and amplified in the new model (McClosky et al., 2006). To avoid this, we remove the tag of any token that the model is uncertain of, i.e., if p(wjt |wsi) < S and Tjt Tis then Tjt = Null. So, on th|ew target side, aligned words have a tag from direct projection or no tag, and unaligned words have a tag assigned by our model. Step 4 estimates the emission and transition target language. If p(wtj|wis) = probabilities as in Algorithm 1. In Step 5, emission probabilities for lexical items in the previous model, but missing from the current model, are added to the current model. Later models therefore take advantage of information from earlier models, and have wider coverage. 5 Experimental Results Using parallel data from Europarl (Koehn, 2005) we apply our method to build taggers for the same eight target languages as Das and Petrov (201 1) Danish, Dutch, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish with English as the source language. Our training data (Europarl) is a subset of the training data of Das and Petrov (who also used the ODS United Nations dataset which we were unable to obtain). The evaluation metric and test data are the same as that used by Das and Petrov. Our results are comparable to theirs, although our system is penalized by having less training data. We tag the source language with the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003). — — 636 DanishDutchGermanGreekItalianPortugueseSpanishSwedishAverage Seed model83.781.183.677.878.684.981.478.981.3 Self training + revision 85.6 84.0 85.4 80.4 81.4 86.3 83.3 81.0 83.4 Das and Petrov (2011) 83.2 79.5 82.8 82.5 86.8 87.9 84.2 80.5 83.4 Table 2: Token-level POS tagging accuracy for our seed model, self training and revision, and the method of Das and Petrov (201 1).

Table 2 shows results for our seed model, self training and revision, and the results reported by Das and Petrov. Self training and revision improve the accuracy for every language over the seed model, and gives an average improvement of roughly two percentage points. The average accuracy of self training and revision is on par with that reported by Das and Petrov. On individual languages, self training and revision and the method of Das and Petrov are split each performs better on half of the cases. Interestingly, our method achieves higher accuracies on Germanic languages the family of our source language, English while Das and Petrov perform better on Romance languages. This might be because our model relies on alignments, which might be more accurate for more-related languages, whereas Das and Petrov additionally rely on label propagation. Compared to Das and Petrov, our model performs poorest on Italian, in terms of percentage point difference in accuracy. Figure 1 (left panel) shows accuracy, accuracy on known words, accuracy on unknown words, and proportion of known tokens for each iteration of our model for Italian; iteration 0 is the seed model, and iteration 3 1 is the final model. Our model performs poorly on unknown words as indicated by the low accuracy on unknown words, and high accuracy on known — — — words compared to the overall accuracy. The poor performance on unknown words is expected because we do not use any language-specific rules to handle this case. Moreover, on average for the final model, approximately 10% of the test data tokens are unknown. One way to improve the performance of our tagger might be to reduce the proportion of unknown words by using a larger training corpus, as Das and Petrov did. We examine the impact of self-training and revision over training iterations. We find that for all languages, accuracy rises quickly in the first 5–6 iterations, and then subsequently improves only slightly. We exemplify this in Figure 1 (right panel) for Dutch. (Findings are similar for other languages.) Although accuracy does not increase much in later iterations, they may still have some benefit as the vocabulary size continues to grow. 6 Conclusion We have proposed a method for unsupervised POS tagging that performs on par with the current state- of-the-art (Das and Petrov, 2011), but is substantially less-sophisticated (specifically not requiring convex optimization or a feature-based HMM). The complexity of our algorithm is O(nlogn) compared to O(n2) for that of Das and Petrov 637 (201 1) where n is the size of training data.3 We made our code are available for download.4 In future work we intend to consider using a larger training corpus to reduce the proportion of unknown tokens and improve accuracy. Given the improvements of our model over that of Das and Petrov on languages from the same family as our source language, and the observation of Snyder et al. (2008) that a better tagger can be learned from a more-closely related language, we also plan to consider strategies for selecting an appropriate source language for a given target language. Using our final model with unsupervised HMM methods might improve the final performance too, i.e. use our final model as the initial state for HMM, then experiment with differ- ent inference algorithms such as Expectation Maximization (EM), Variational Bayers (VB) or Gibbs sampling (GS).5 Gao and Johnson (2008) compare EM, VB and GS for unsupervised English POS tagging. In many cases, GS outperformed other methods, thus we would like to try GS first for our model. 7 Acknowledgements This work is funded by Erasmus Mundus European Masters Program in Language and Communication Technologies (EM-LCT) and by the Czech Science Foundation (grant no.

<p>Author: Long Duong ; Paul Cook ; Steven Bird ; Pavel Pecina</p><p>Abstract: We present an unsupervised approach to part-of-speech tagging based on projections of tags in a word-aligned bilingual parallel corpus. In contrast to the existing state-of-the-art approach of Das and Petrov, we have developed a substantially simpler method by automatically identifying “good” training sentences from the parallel corpus and applying self-training. In experimental results on eight languages, our method achieves state-of-the-art results. 1 Unsupervised part-of-speech tagging Currently, part-of-speech (POS) taggers are available for many highly spoken and well-resourced languages such as English, French, German, Italian, and Arabic. For example, Petrov et al. (2012) build supervised POS taggers for 22 languages using the TNT tagger (Brants, 2000), with an average accuracy of 95.2%. However, many widelyspoken languages including Bengali, Javanese, and Lahnda have little data manually labelled for POS, limiting supervised approaches to POS tagging for these languages. However, with the growing quantity of text available online, and in particular, multilingual parallel texts from sources such as multilingual websites, government documents and large archives ofhuman translations ofbooks, news, and so forth, unannotated parallel data is becoming more widely available. This parallel data can be exploited to bridge languages, and in particular, transfer information from a highly-resourced language to a lesser-resourced language, to build unsupervised POS taggers. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to POS tagging in a similar vein to the work of Das and Petrov (201 1). In this approach, — — pecina@ ufal .mff .cuni . c z a parallel corpus for a more-resourced language having a POS tagger, and a lesser-resourced language, is word-aligned. These alignments are exploited to infer an unsupervised tagger for the target language (i.e., a tagger not requiring manuallylabelled data in the target language). Our approach is substantially simpler than that of Das and Petrov, the current state-of-the art, yet performs comparably well. 2 Related work There is a wealth of prior research on building unsupervised POS taggers. Some approaches have exploited similarities between typologically similar languages (e.g., Czech and Russian, or Telugu and Kannada) to estimate the transition probabilities for an HMM tagger for one language based on a corpus for another language (e.g., Hana et al., 2004; Feldman et al., 2006; Reddy and Sharoff, 2011). Other approaches have simultaneously tagged two languages based on alignments in a parallel corpus (e.g., Snyder et al., 2008). A number of studies have used tag projection to copy tag information from a resource-rich to a resource-poor language, based on word alignments in a parallel corpus. After alignment, the resource-rich language is tagged, and tags are projected from the source language to the target language based on the alignment (e.g., Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001 ; Das and Petrov, 2011). Das and Petrov (201 1) achieved the current state-of-the-art for unsupervised tagging by exploiting high confidence alignments to copy tags from the source language to the target language. Graph-based label propagation was used to automatically produce more labelled training data. First, a graph was constructed in which each vertex corresponds to a unique trigram, and edge weights represent the syntactic similarity between vertices. Labels were then propagated by optimizing a convex function to favor the same tags for closely related nodes 634 Proce dingSsof oifa, th Beu 5l1gsarti Aan,An u aglu Mste 4e-ti9n2g 0 o1f3 t.he ?c A2s0s1o3ci Aatsiosonc fioartio Cno fmorpu Ctoamtiopnuatalt Lioin gauli Lsitnicgsu,i psatgices 634–639, ModelCoverageAccuracy Many-to-1 alignments88%68% 1-to-1 alignments 68% 78% 1-to-1 alignments: Top 60k sents 91% 80% Table 1: Token coverage and accuracy of manyto-one and 1-to-1 alignments, as well as the top 60k sentences based on alignment score for 1-to-1 alignments, using directly-projected labels only. while keeping a uniform tag distribution for unrelated nodes. A tag dictionary was then extracted from the automatically labelled data, and this was used to constrain a feature-based HMM tagger. The method we propose here is simpler to that of Das and Petrov in that it does not require convex optimization for label propagation or a feature based HMM, yet it achieves comparable results. 3 Tagset Our tagger exploits the idea ofprojecting tag information from a resource-rich to resource-poor language. To facilitate this mapping, we adopt Petrov et al.’s (2012) twelve universal tags: NOUN, VERB, ADJ, ADV, PRON (pronouns), DET (de- terminers and articles), ADP (prepositions and postpositions), NUM (numerals), CONJ (conjunctions), PRT (particles), “.” (punctuation), and X (all other categories, e.g., foreign words, abbreviations). These twelve basic tags are common across taggers for most languages. Adopting a universal tagset avoids the need to map between a variety of different, languagespecific tagsets. Furthermore, it makes it possible to apply unsupervised tagging methods to languages for which no tagset is available, such as Telugu and Vietnamese. 4 A Simpler Unsupervised POS Tagger Here we describe our proposed tagger. The key idea is to maximize the amount of information gleaned from the source language, while limiting the amount of noise. We describe the seed model and then explain how it is successively refined through self-training and revision. 4.1 Seed Model The first step is to construct a seed tagger from directly-projected labels. Given a parallel corpus for a source and target language, Algorithm 1provides a method for building an unsupervised tagger for the target language. In typical applications, the source language would be a better-resourced language having a tagger, while the target language would be lesser-resourced, lacking a tagger and large amounts of manually POS-labelled data. Algorithm 1 Build seed model Algorithm 1Build seed model 1:Tag source side. 2: Word align the corpus with Giza++ and remove the many-to-one mappings. 3: Project tags from source to target using the remaining 1-to-1 alignments. 4: Select the top n sentences based on sentence alignment score. 5: Estimate emission and transition probabilities. 6: Build seed tagger T. We eliminate many-to-one alignments (Step 2). Keeping these would give more POS-tagged tokens for the target side, but also introduce noise. For example, suppose English and French were the source and target language, respectively. In this case alignments such as English laws (NNS) to French les (DT) lois (NNS) would be expected (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001). However, in Step 3, where tags are projected from the source to target language, this would incorrectly tag French les as NN. We build a French tagger based on English– French data from the Europarl Corpus (Koehn, 2005). We also compare the accuracy and coverage of the tags obtained through direct projection using the French Melt POS tagger (Denis and Sagot, 2009). Table 1confirms that the one-to-one alignments indeed give higher accuracy but lower coverage than the many-to-one alignments. At this stage of the model we hypothesize that highconfidence tags are important, and hence eliminate the many-to-one alignments. In Step 4, in an effort to again obtain higher quality target language tags from direct projection, we eliminate all but the top n sentences based on their alignment scores, as provided by the aligner via IBM model 3. We heuristically set this cutoff × to 60k to balance the accuracy and size of the seed model.1 Returning to our preliminary English– French experiments in Table 1, this process gives improvements in both accuracy and coverage.2 1We considered values in the range 60–90k, but this choice had little impact on the accuracy of the model. 2We also considered using all projected labels for the top 60k sentences, not just 1-to-1 alignments, but in preliminary experiments this did not perform as well, possibly due to the previously-observed problems with many-to-one alignments. 635 The number of parameters for the emission probability is |V | |T| where V is the vocabulary and aTb iilsi ttyh eis tag |s e×t. TTh| ew htrearnesi Vtio ins probability, on atnhed other hand, has only |T|3 parameters for the trigram hmaondde,l we use. TB|ecause of this difference in number of parameters, in step 5, we use different strategies to estimate the emission and transition probabilities. The emission probability is estimated from all 60k selected sentences. However, for the transition probability, which has less parameters, we again focus on “better” sentences, by estimating this probability from only those sen- tences that have (1) token coverage > 90% (based on direct projection of tags from the source language), and (2) length > 4 tokens. These criteria aim to identify longer, mostly-tagged sentences, which we hypothesize are particularly useful as training data. In the case of our preliminary English–French experiments, roughly 62% of the 60k selected sentences meet these criteria and are used to estimate the transition probability. For unaligned words, we simply assign a random POS and very low probability, which does not substantially affect transition probability estimates. In Step 6 we build a tagger by feeding the estimated emission and transition probabilities into the TNT tagger (Brants, 2000), an implementation of a trigram HMM tagger. 4.2 Self training and revision For self training and revision, we use the seed model, along with the large number of target language sentences available that have been partially tagged through direct projection, in order to build a more accurate tagger. Algorithm 2 describes this process of self training and revision, and assumes that the parallel source–target corpus has been word aligned, with many-to-one alignments removed, and that the sentences are sorted by alignment score. In contrast to Algorithm 1, all sentences are used, not just the 60k sentences with the highest alignment scores. We believe that sentence alignment score might correspond to difficulty to tag. By sorting the sentences by alignment score, sentences which are more difficult to tag are tagged using a more mature model. Following Algorithm 1, we divide sentences into blocks of 60k. In step 3 the tagged block is revised by comparing the tags from the tagger with those obtained through direct projection. Suppose source Algorithm 2 Self training and revision 1:Divide target language sentences into blocks of n sentences. 2: Tag the first block with the seed tagger. 3: Revise the tagged block. 4: Train a new tagger on the tagged block. 5: Add the previous tagger’s lexicon to the new tagger. 6: Use the new tagger to tag the next block. 7: Goto 3 and repeat until all blocks are tagged. language word wis is aligned with target language word wjt with probability p(wjt |wsi), Tis is the tag for wis using the tagger availa|bwle for the source language, and Tjt is the tag for wjt using the tagger learned for the > S, where S is a threshold which we heuristically set to 0.7, we replace Tjt by Tis. Self-training can suffer from over-fitting, in which errors in the original model are repeated and amplified in the new model (McClosky et al., 2006). To avoid this, we remove the tag of any token that the model is uncertain of, i.e., if p(wjt |wsi) < S and Tjt Tis then Tjt = Null. So, on th|ew target side, aligned words have a tag from direct projection or no tag, and unaligned words have a tag assigned by our model. Step 4 estimates the emission and transition target language. If p(wtj|wis) = probabilities as in Algorithm 1. In Step 5, emission probabilities for lexical items in the previous model, but missing from the current model, are added to the current model. Later models therefore take advantage of information from earlier models, and have wider coverage. 5 Experimental Results Using parallel data from Europarl (Koehn, 2005) we apply our method to build taggers for the same eight target languages as Das and Petrov (201 1) Danish, Dutch, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish with English as the source language. Our training data (Europarl) is a subset of the training data of Das and Petrov (who also used the ODS United Nations dataset which we were unable to obtain). The evaluation metric and test data are the same as that used by Das and Petrov. Our results are comparable to theirs, although our system is penalized by having less training data. We tag the source language with the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003). — — 636 DanishDutchGermanGreekItalianPortugueseSpanishSwedishAverage Seed model83.781.183.677.878.684.981.478.981.3 Self training + revision 85.6 84.0 85.4 80.4 81.4 86.3 83.3 81.0 83.4 Das and Petrov (2011) 83.2 79.5 82.8 82.5 86.8 87.9 84.2 80.5 83.4 Table 2: Token-level POS tagging accuracy for our seed model, self training and revision, and the method of Das and Petrov (201 1).

Table 2 shows results for our seed model, self training and revision, and the results reported by Das and Petrov. Self training and revision improve the accuracy for every language over the seed model, and gives an average improvement of roughly two percentage points. The average accuracy of self training and revision is on par with that reported by Das and Petrov. On individual languages, self training and revision and the method of Das and Petrov are split each performs better on half of the cases. Interestingly, our method achieves higher accuracies on Germanic languages the family of our source language, English while Das and Petrov perform better on Romance languages. This might be because our model relies on alignments, which might be more accurate for more-related languages, whereas Das and Petrov additionally rely on label propagation. Compared to Das and Petrov, our model performs poorest on Italian, in terms of percentage point difference in accuracy. Figure 1 (left panel) shows accuracy, accuracy on known words, accuracy on unknown words, and proportion of known tokens for each iteration of our model for Italian; iteration 0 is the seed model, and iteration 3 1 is the final model. Our model performs poorly on unknown words as indicated by the low accuracy on unknown words, and high accuracy on known — — — words compared to the overall accuracy. The poor performance on unknown words is expected because we do not use any language-specific rules to handle this case. Moreover, on average for the final model, approximately 10% of the test data tokens are unknown. One way to improve the performance of our tagger might be to reduce the proportion of unknown words by using a larger training corpus, as Das and Petrov did. We examine the impact of self-training and revision over training iterations. We find that for all languages, accuracy rises quickly in the first 5–6 iterations, and then subsequently improves only slightly. We exemplify this in Figure 1 (right panel) for Dutch. (Findings are similar for other languages.) Although accuracy does not increase much in later iterations, they may still have some benefit as the vocabulary size continues to grow. 6 Conclusion We have proposed a method for unsupervised POS tagging that performs on par with the current state- of-the-art (Das and Petrov, 2011), but is substantially less-sophisticated (specifically not requiring convex optimization or a feature-based HMM). The complexity of our algorithm is O(nlogn) compared to O(n2) for that of Das and Petrov 637 (201 1) where n is the size of training data.3 We made our code are available for download.4 In future work we intend to consider using a larger training corpus to reduce the proportion of unknown tokens and improve accuracy. Given the improvements of our model over that of Das and Petrov on languages from the same family as our source language, and the observation of Snyder et al. (2008) that a better tagger can be learned from a more-closely related language, we also plan to consider strategies for selecting an appropriate source language for a given target language. Using our final model with unsupervised HMM methods might improve the final performance too, i.e. use our final model as the initial state for HMM, then experiment with differ- ent inference algorithms such as Expectation Maximization (EM), Variational Bayers (VB) or Gibbs sampling (GS).5 Gao and Johnson (2008) compare EM, VB and GS for unsupervised English POS tagging. In many cases, GS outperformed other methods, thus we would like to try GS first for our model. 7 Acknowledgements This work is funded by Erasmus Mundus European Masters Program in Language and Communication Technologies (EM-LCT) and by the Czech Science Foundation (grant no.

<p>Author: Mikhail Kozhevnikov ; Ivan Titov</p><p>Abstract: Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) has become one of the standard tasks of natural language processing and proven useful as a source of information for a number of other applications. We address the problem of transferring an SRL model from one language to another using a shared feature representation. This approach is then evaluated on three language pairs, demonstrating competitive performance as compared to a state-of-the-art unsupervised SRL system and a cross-lingual annotation projection baseline. We also consider the contribution of different aspects of the feature representation to the performance of the model and discuss practical applicability of this method. 1 Background and Motivation Semantic role labeling has proven useful in many natural language processing tasks, such as question answering (Shen and Lapata, 2007; Kaisser and Webber, 2007), textual entailment (Sammons et al., 2009), machine translation (Wu and Fung, 2009; Liu and Gildea, 2010; Gao and Vogel, 2011) and dialogue systems (Basili et al., 2009; van der Plas et al., 2009). Multiple models have been designed to automatically predict semantic roles, and a considerable amount of data has been annotated to train these models, if only for a few more popular languages. As the annotation is costly, one would like to leverage existing resources to minimize the human effort required to construct a model for a new language. A number of approaches to the construction of semantic role labeling models for new languages have been proposed. On one end of the scale is unsupervised SRL, such as Grenager and Manning (2006), which requires some expert knowledge, but no labeled data. It clusters together arguments that should bear the same semantic role, but does not assign a particular role to each cluster. On the other end is annotating a new dataset from scratch. There are also intermediate options, which often make use of similarities between languages. This way, if an accurate model exists for one language, it should help simplify the construction of a model for another, related language. The approaches in this third group often use parallel data to bridge the gap between languages. Cross-lingual annotation projection systems (Pad o´ and Lapata, 2009), for example, propagate information directly via word alignment links. However, they are very sensitive to the quality of parallel data, as well as the accuracy of a sourcelanguage model on it. An alternative approach, known as cross-lingual model transfer, or cross-lingual model adaptation, consists of modifying a source-language model to make it directly applicable to a new language. This usually involves constructing a shared feature representation across the two languages. McDonald et al. (201 1) successfully apply this idea to the transfer of dependency parsers, using part-of- speech tags as the shared representation of words. A later extension of T ¨ackstr o¨m et al. (2012) enriches this representation with cross-lingual word clusters, considerably improving the performance. In the case of SRL, a shared representation that is purely syntactic is likely to be insufficient, since structures with different semantics may be realized by the same syntactic construct, for example “in August” vs “in Britain”. However with the help of recently introduced cross-lingual word represen1190 Proce dingsS o f ita h,e B 5u1lgsta Arinan,u Aaulg Musete 4ti-n9g 2 o0f1 t3h.e ? Ac s2s0o1ci3a Atiosnso fcoirat Cio nm foprut Caotimonpaulta Lti nognuails Lti cnsg,u piasgteics 1 90–120 , tations, such as the cross-lingual clustering mentioned above or cross-lingual distributed word representations of Klementiev et al. (2012), we may be able to transfer models of shallow semantics in a similar fashion. In this work we construct a shared feature representation for a pair of languages, employing crosslingual representations of syntactic and lexical information, train a semantic role labeling model on one language and apply it to the other one. This approach yields an SRL model for a new language at a very low cost, effectively requiring only a source language model and parallel data. We evaluate on five (directed) language pairs EN-ZH, ZH-EN, EN-CZ, CZ-EN and EN-FR, where EN, FR, CZ and ZH denote English, French, Czech and Chinese, respectively. The transferred model is compared against two baselines: an unsupervised SRL system and a model trained on the output of a cross-lingual annotation projection system. In the next section we will describe our setup, then in section 3 present the shared feature representation we use, discuss the evaluation data and other technical aspects in section 4, present the results and conclude with an overview of related work. – 2 Setup The purpose of the study is not to develop a yet another semantic role labeling system any existing SRL system can (after some modification) be used in this setup but to assess the practical applicability of cross-lingual model transfer to this – – problem, compare it against the alternatives and identify its strong/weak points depending on a particular setup. 2.1 Semantic Role Labeling Model We consider the dependency-based version of semantic role labeling as described in Haji cˇ et al. (2009) and transfer an SRL model from one language to another. We only consider verbal predicates and ignore the predicate disambiguation stage. We also assume that the predicate identification information is available in most languages it can be obtained using a relatively simple heuristic based on part-of-speech tags. The model performs argument identification and classification (Johansson and Nugues, 2008) separately in a pipeline first each candidate is classified as being or not being a head of an argument phrase with respect to the predicate in question and then each of the arguments is assigned a role from a given inventory. The model is factorized over arguments the decisions regarding the classification of different arguments are made in– – – dependently of each other. With respect to the use of syntactic annotation we consider two options: using an existing dependency parser for the target language and obtaining one by means of cross-lingual transfer (see section 4.2). Following McDonald et al. (201 1), we assume that a part-of-speech tagger is available for the target language. 2.2 SRL in the Low-resource Setting Several approaches have been proposed to obtain an SRL model for a new language with little or no manual annotation. Unsupervised SRL models (Lang and Lapata, 2010) cluster the arguments of predicates in a given corpus according to their semantic roles. The performance of such models can be impressive, especially for those languages where semantic roles correlate strongly with syntactic relation of the argument to its predicate. However, assigning meaningful role labels to the resulting clusters requires additional effort and the model’s parameters generally need some adjustment for every language. If the necessary resources are already available for a closely related language, they can be utilized to facilitate the construction of a model for the target language. This can be achieved either by means of cross-lingual annotation projection (Yarowsky et al., 2001) or by cross-lingual model transfer (Zeman and Resnik, 2008). This last approach is the one we are considering in this work, and the other two options are treated as baselines. The unsupervised model will be further referred to as UNSUP and the projection baseline as PROJ. 2.3 Evaluation Measures We use the F1 measure as a metric for the argument identification stage and accuracy as an aggregate measure of argument classification performance. When comparing to the unsupervised SRL system the clustering evaluation measures are used instead. These are purity and collocation 1191 N1Ximajx|Gj∩ Ci| CO =N1Xjmiax|Gj∩ Ci|, PU = where Ci is the set of arguments in the i-th induced cluster, Gj is the set of arguments in the jth gold cluster and N is the total number of arguments. We report the harmonic mean ofthe two (Lang and Lapata, 2011) and denote it F1c to avoid confusing it with the supervised metric. 3 Model Transfer The idea of this work is to abstract the model away from the particular source language and apply it to a new one. This setup requires that we use the same feature representation for both languages, for example part-of-speech tags and dependency relation labels should be from the same inventory. Some features are not applicable to certain lan- guages because the corresponding phenomena are absent in them. For example, consider a strongly inflected language and an analytic one. While the latter can usually convey the information encoded in the word form in the former one (number, gender, etc.), finding a shared feature representation for such information is non-trivial. In this study we will confine ourselves to those features that are applicable to all languages in question, namely: part-of-speech tags, syntactic dependency structures and representations of the word’s identity. 3.1 Lexical Information We train a model on one language and apply it to a different one. In order for this to work, the words of the two languages have to be mapped into a common feature space. It is also desirable that closely related words from both languages have similar representations in this space. Word mapping. The first option is simply to use the source language words as the shared representation. Here every source language word would have itself as its representation and every target word would map into a source word that corresponds to it. In other words, we supply the model with a gloss of the target sentence. The mapping (bilingual dictionary) we use is derived from a word-aligned parallel corpus, by identifying, for each word in the target language, the word in the source language it is most often aligned to. Cross-lingual clusters. There is no guarantee that each of the words in the evaluation data is present in our dictionary, nor that the corresponding source-language word is present in the training data, so the model would benefit from the ability to generalize over closely related words. This can, for example, be achieved by using cross-lingual word clusters induced in T ¨ackstr o¨m et al. (2012). We incorporate these clusters as features into our model. 3.2 Syntactic Information Part-of-speech Tags. We map part-of-speech tags into the universal tagset following Petrov et al. (2012). This may have a negative effect on the performance of a monolingual model, since most part-of-speech tagsets are more fine-grained than the universal POS tags considered here. For example Penn Treebank inventory contains 36 tags and the universal POS tagset only 12. Since the finergrained POS tags often reflect more languagespecific phenomena, however, they would only be useful for very closely related languages in the cross-lingual setting. The universal part-of-speech tags used in evaluation are derived from gold-standard annotation for all languages except French, where predicted ones had to be used instead. Dependency Structure. Another important aspect of syntactic information is the dependency structure. Most dependency relation inventories are language-specific, and finding a shared representation for them is a challenging problem. One could map dependency relations into a simplified form that would be shared between languages, as it is done for part-of-speech tags in Petrov et al. (2012). The extent to which this would be useful, however, depends on the similarity of syntactic-semantic in– terfaces of the languages in question. In this work we discard the dependency relation labels where the inventories do not match and only consider the unlabeled syntactic dependency graph. Some discrepancies, such as variations in attachment order, may be present even there, but this does not appear to be the case with the datasets we use for evaluation. If a target language is poor in resources, one can obtain a dependency parser for the target language by means of cross-lingual model transfer (Zeman and Resnik, 2008). We 1192 take this into account and evaluate both using the original dependency structures and the ones obtained by means of cross-lingual model transfer. 3.3 The Model The model we use is based on that of Bj ¨orkelund et al. (2009). It is comprised of a set of linear classifiers trained using Liblinear (Fan et al., 2008). The feature model was modified to accommodate the cross-lingual cluster features and the reranker component was not used. We do not model the interaction between different argument roles in the same predicate. While this has been found useful, in the cross-lingual setup one has to be careful with the assumptions made. For example, modeling the sequence of roles using a Markov chain (Thompson et al., 2003) may not work well in the present setting, especially between distant languages, as the order or arguments is not necessarily preserved. Most constraints that prove useful for SRL (Chang et al., 2007) also require customization when applied to a new language, and some rely on languagespecific resources, such as a valency lexicon. Taking into account the interaction between different arguments of a predicate is likely to improve the performance of the transferred model, but this is outside the scope of this work. 3.4 Feature Selection Compatibility of feature representations is necessary but not sufficient for successful model transfer. We have to make sure that the features we use are predictive of similar outcomes in the two languages as well. Depending on the pair of languages in question, different aspects of the feature representation will retain or lose their predictive power. We can be reasonably certain that the identity of an argument word is predictive of its semantic role in any language, but it might or might not be true of, for example, the word directly preceding the argument word. It is therefore important to pre- SCPDGylOespoSntreslTabunc1lra:obsFel-daitnguplrdoaeusntpagd-elronwfu-dcsopeyrnsd c.eylafguhtorsia mepgnrhs vent the model from capturing overly specific aspects of the source language, which we do by confining the model to first-order features. We also avoid feature selection, which, performed on the source language, is unlikely to help the model to better generalize to the target one. The experiments confirm that feature selection and the use of second-order features degrade the performance of the transferred model. 3.5 Feature Groups For each word, we use its part-of-speech tag, cross-lingual cluster id, word identity (glossed, when evaluating on the target language) and its dependency relation to its parent. Features associated with an argument word include the attributes of the predicate word, the argument word, its parent, siblings and children, and the words directly preceding and following it. Also included are the sequences of part-of-speech tags and dependency relations on the path between the predicate and the argument. Since we are also interested in the impact of different aspects of the feature representation, we divide the features into groups as summarized in table 1 and evaluate their respective contributions to the performance of the model. If a feature group is enabled the model has access to the corre– sponding source of information. For example, if only POS group is enabled, the model relies on the part-of-speech tags of the argument, the predicate and the words to the right and left of the argument word. If Synt is enabled too, it also uses the POS tags of the argument’s parent, children and siblings. Word order information constitutes an implicit group that is always available. It includes the Pos it ion feature, which indicates whether the argument is located to the left or to the right of the predicate, and allows the model to look up the attributes of the words directly preceding and following the argument word. The model we compare against the baselines uses all applicable feature groups (Deprel is only used in EN-CZ and CZ-EN experiments with original syntax). 4 Evaluation 4.1 Datasets and Preprocessing Evaluation of the cross-lingual model transfer requires a rather specific kind of dataset. Namely, the data in both languages has to be annotated 1193 with the same set of semantic roles following the same (or compatible) guidelines, which is seldom the case. We have identified three language pairs for which such resources are available: EnglishChinese, English-Czech and English-French. The evaluation datasets for English and Chinese are those from the CoNLL Shared Task 2009 (Haji ˇc et al., 2009) (henceforth CoNLL-ST). Their annotation in the CoNLL-ST is not identical, but the guidelines for “core” semantic roles are similar (Kingsbury et al., 2004), so we evaluate only on core roles here. The data for the second language pair is drawn from the Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0 (Haji ˇc et al., 2012), which we converted to a format similar to that of CoNLL-ST1 . The original annotation uses the tectogrammatical representation (Haji ˇc, 2002) and an inventory of semantic roles (or functors), most of which are interpretable across various predicates. Also note that the syntactic anno- tation of English and Czech in PCEDT 2.0 is quite similar (to the extent permitted by the difference in the structure of the two languages) and we can use the dependency relations in our experiments. For English-French, the English CoNLL-ST dataset was used as a source and the model was evaluated on the manually annotated dataset from van der Plas et al. (201 1). The latter contains one thousand sentences from the French part ofthe Europarl (Koehn, 2005) corpus, annotated with semantic roles following an adapted version of PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) guidelines. The authors perform annotation projection from English to French, using a joint model of syntax and semantics and employing heuristics for filtering. We use a model trained on the output of this projection system as one of the baselines. The evaluation dataset is relatively small in this case, so we perform the transfer only one-way, from English to French. The part-of-speech tags in all datasets were replaced with the universal POS tags of Petrov et al. (2012). For Czech, we have augmented the map- pings to account for the tags that were not present in the datasets from which the original mappings were derived. Namely, tag “t” is mapped to “VERB” and “Y” to “PRON”. We use parallel data to construct a bilingual dictionary used in word mapping, as well as in the projection baseline. For English-Czech – 1see http://www.ml4nlp.de/code-and-data/treex2conll and English-French, the data is drawn from Europarl (Koehn, 2005), for English-Chinese from MultiUN (Eisele and Chen, 2010). The word alignments were obtained using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) and the intersection heuristic. – 4.2 Syntactic Transfer In the low-resource setting, we cannot always rely on the availability of an accurate dependency parser for the target language. If one is not available, the natural solution would be to use crosslingual model transfer to obtain it. Unfortunately, the models presented in the previous work, such as Zeman and Resnik (2008), McDonald et al. (201 1) and T ¨ackstr o¨m et al. (2012), were not made available, so we reproduced the direct transfer algorithm of McDonald et al. (201 1), using Malt parser (Nivre, 2008) and the same set of features. We did not reimplement the projected transfer algorithm, however, and used the default training procedure instead of perceptron-based learning. The dependency structure thus obtained is, of course, only a rough approximation even a much more sophisticated algorithm may not perform well when transferring syntax between such languages as Czech and English, given the inherent difference in their structure. The scores are shown in table 2. We will henceforth refer to the syntactic annotations that were provided with the datasets as original, as opposed to the annotations obtained by means of syntactic transfer. – 4.3 Baselines Unsupervised Baseline: We are using a version of the unsupervised semantic role induction system of Titov and Klementiev (2012a) adapted to SetupUAS, % Table2:SyntaciE C ZcN HNt- rE ZaCFnN HZRsfer34 692567acuracy,unlabe dat- tachment score (percent). Note that in case of French we evaluate against the output of a supervised system, since manual annotation is not available for this dataset. This score does not reflect the true performance of syntactic transfer. 1194 the shared feature representation considered in order to make the scores comparable with those of the transfer model and, more importantly, to enable evaluation on transferred syntax. Note that the original system, tailored to a more expressive language-specific syntactic representation and equipped with heuristics to identify active/passive voice and other phenomena, achieves higher scores than those we report here. Projection Baseline: The projection baseline we use for English-Czech and English-Chinese is a straightforward one: we label the source side of a parallel corpus using the source-language model, then identify those verbs on the target side that are aligned to a predicate, mark them as predicates and propagate the argument roles in the same fashion. A model is then trained on the resulting training data and applied to the test set. For English-French we instead use the output of a fully featured projection model of van der Plas et al. (201 1), published in the CLASSiC project. 5 Results In order to ensure that the results are consistent, the test sets, except for the French one, were partitioned into five equal parts (of 5 to 10 thousand sentences each, depending on the dataset) and the evaluation performed separately on each one. All evaluation figures for English, Czech or Chinese below are the average values over the five subsets. In case of French, the evaluation dataset is too small to split it further, so instead we ran the evaluation five times on a randomly selected 80% sample of the evaluation data and averaged over those. In both cases the results are consistent over the subsets, the standard deviation does not exceed 0.5% for the transfer system and projection baseline and 1% for the unsupervised system. 5.1 Argument Identification We summarize the results in table 3. Argument identification is known to rely heavily on syntactic information, so it is unsurprising that it proves inaccurate when transferred syntax is used. Our simple projection baseline suffers from the same problem. Even with original syntactic information available, the performance of argument identification is moderate. Note that the model of (van der Plas et al., 2011), though relying on more expressive syntax, only outperforms the transferred system by 3% (F1) on this task.

Most unsupervised SRL approaches assume that the argument identification is performed by some external means, for example heuristically (Lang and Lapata, 2011). Such heuristics or unsupervised approaches to argument identification (Abend et al., 2009) can also be used in the present setup. 5.2 Argument Classification In the following tables, TRANS column contains the results for the transferred system, UNSUP for the unsupervised baseline and PROJ for projection baseline.

In the more realistic scenario with transferred syn- tax, however, the transferred model proves more accurate. In table 5 we compare the transferred system with the projection baseline. It is easy to see that the scores vary strongly depending on the language pair, due to both the difference in the annotation scheme used and the degree of relatedness between the languages. The drop in performance when transferring the model to another language is large in every case, though, see table 6.

Table 8 contains the results for English-French. FeaturesOrigTrans ferent feature subsets, using original and transferred syntactic information. The fact that the model performs slightly better with transferred syntax may be explained by two factors. Firstly, as we already mentioned, the original syntactic annotation is also produced automatically. Secondly, in the model transfer setup it is more important how closely the syntacticsemantic interface on the target side resembles that on the source side than how well it matches the “true” structure of the target language, and in this respect a transferred dependency parser may have an advantage over one trained on target-language data. The high impact of the Glos s features here 1196 may be partly attributed to the fact that the mapping is derived from the same corpus as the evaluation data Europarl (Koehn, 2005) and partly by the similarity between English and French in terms of word order, usage of articles and prepositions. The moderate contribution of the crosslingual cluster features are likely due to the insufficient granularity of the clustering for this task. For more distant language pairs, the contributions of individual feature groups are less interpretable, so we only highlight a few observations. First of all, both EN-CZ and CZ-EN benefit noticeably from the use of the original syntactic annotation, including dependency relations, but not from the transferred syntax, most likely due to the low syntactic transfer performance. Both perform better when lexical information is available, although – – the improvement is not as significant as in the case of French only up to 5%. The situation with Chinese is somewhat complicated in that adding lexical information here fails to yield an improvement in terms of the metric considered. This is likely due to the fact that we consider only the core roles, which can usually be predicted with high accuracy based on syntactic information alone. – 6 Related Work Development of robust statistical models for core NLP tasks is a challenging problem, and adaptation of existing models to new languages presents a viable alternative to exhaustive annotation for each language. Although the models thus obtained are generally imperfect, they can be further refined for a particular language and domain using techniques such as active learning (Settles, 2010; Chen et al., 2011). Cross-lingual annotation projection (Yarowsky et al., 2001) approaches have been applied ex- tensively to a variety of tasks, including POS tagging (Xi and Hwa, 2005; Das and Petrov, 2011), morphology segmentation (Snyder and Barzilay, 2008), verb classification (Merlo et al., 2002), mention detection (Zitouni and Florian, 2008), LFG parsing (Wr o´blewska and Frank, 2009), information extraction (Kim et al., 2010), SRL (Pad o´ and Lapata, 2009; van der Plas et al., 2011; Annesi and Basili, 2010; Tonelli and Pianta, 2008), dependency parsing (Naseem et al., 2012; Ganchev et al., 2009; Smith and Eisner, 2009; Hwa et al., 2005) or temporal relation prediction (Spreyer and Frank, 2008). Interestingly, it has also been used to propagate morphosyntactic information between old and modern versions of the same language (Meyer, 2011). Cross-lingual model transfer methods (McDonald et al., 2011; Zeman and Resnik, 2008; Durrett et al., 2012; Søgaard, 2011; Lopez et al., 2008) have also been receiving much attention recently. The basic idea behind model transfer is similar to that of cross-lingual annotation projection, as we can see from the way parallel data is used in, for example, McDonald et al. (201 1). A crucial component of direct transfer approaches is the unified feature representation. There are at least two such representations of lexical information (Klementiev et al., 2012; T ¨ackstr o¨m et al., 2012), but both work on word level. This makes it hard to account for phenomena that are expressed differently in the languages considered, for example the syntactic function of a certain word may be indicated by a preposition, inflection or word order, depending on the language. Accurate representation of such information would require an extra level of abstraction (Haji ˇc, 2002). A side-effect ofusing adaptation methods is that we are forced to use the same annotation scheme for the task in question (SRL, in our case), which in turn simplifies the development of cross-lingual tools for downstream tasks. Such representations are also likely to be useful in machine translation. Unsupervised semantic role labeling methods (Lang and Lapata, 2010; Lang and Lapata, 2011; Titov and Klementiev, 2012a; Lorenzo and Cerisara, 2012) also constitute an alternative to cross-lingual model transfer. For an overview of of semi-supervised approaches we refer the reader to Titov and Klementiev (2012b). 7 Conclusion We have considered the cross-lingual model transfer approach as applied to the task of semantic role labeling and observed that for closely related languages it performs comparably to annotation projection approaches. It allows one to quickly construct an SRL model for a new language without manual annotation or language-specific heuristics, provided an accurate model is available for one of the related languages along with a certain amount of parallel data for the two languages. While an1197 notation projection approaches require sentenceand word-aligned parallel data and crucially depend on the accuracy of the syntactic parsing and SRL on the source side of the parallel corpus, cross-lingual model transfer can be performed using only a bilingual dictionary. Unsupervised SRL approaches have their advantages, in particular when no annotated data is available for any of the related languages and there is a syntactic parser available for the target one, but the annotation they produce is not always sufficient. In applications such as Information Retrieval it is preferable to have precise labels, rather than just clusters of arguments, for example. Also note that when applying cross-lingual model transfer in practice, one can improve upon the performance of the simplistic model we use for evaluation, for example by picking the features manually, taking into account the properties of the target language. Domain adaptation techniques can also be employed to adjust the model to the target language.

<p>Author: Zhiguo Wang ; Chengqing Zong ; Nianwen Xue</p><p>Abstract: For the cascaded task of Chinese word segmentation, POS tagging and parsing, the pipeline approach suffers from error propagation while the joint learning approach suffers from inefficient decoding due to the large combined search space. In this paper, we present a novel lattice-based framework in which a Chinese sentence is first segmented into a word lattice, and then a lattice-based POS tagger and a lattice-based parser are used to process the lattice from two different viewpoints: sequential POS tagging and hierarchical tree building. A strategy is designed to exploit the complementary strengths of the tagger and parser, and encourage them to predict agreed structures. Experimental results on Chinese Treebank show that our lattice-based framework significantly improves the accuracy of the three sub-tasks. 1</p><p>5 0.16061963 <a title="323-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Universal_Dependency_Annotation_for_Multilingual_Parsing.html">368 acl-2013-Universal Dependency Annotation for Multilingual Parsing</a></p>

<p>Author: Long Duong ; Paul Cook ; Steven Bird ; Pavel Pecina</p><p>Abstract: We present an unsupervised approach to part-of-speech tagging based on projections of tags in a word-aligned bilingual parallel corpus. In contrast to the existing state-of-the-art approach of Das and Petrov, we have developed a substantially simpler method by automatically identifying “good” training sentences from the parallel corpus and applying self-training. In experimental results on eight languages, our method achieves state-of-the-art results. 1 Unsupervised part-of-speech tagging Currently, part-of-speech (POS) taggers are available for many highly spoken and well-resourced languages such as English, French, German, Italian, and Arabic. For example, Petrov et al. (2012) build supervised POS taggers for 22 languages using the TNT tagger (Brants, 2000), with an average accuracy of 95.2%. However, many widelyspoken languages including Bengali, Javanese, and Lahnda have little data manually labelled for POS, limiting supervised approaches to POS tagging for these languages. However, with the growing quantity of text available online, and in particular, multilingual parallel texts from sources such as multilingual websites, government documents and large archives ofhuman translations ofbooks, news, and so forth, unannotated parallel data is becoming more widely available. This parallel data can be exploited to bridge languages, and in particular, transfer information from a highly-resourced language to a lesser-resourced language, to build unsupervised POS taggers. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to POS tagging in a similar vein to the work of Das and Petrov (201 1). In this approach, — — pecina@ ufal .mff .cuni . c z a parallel corpus for a more-resourced language having a POS tagger, and a lesser-resourced language, is word-aligned. These alignments are exploited to infer an unsupervised tagger for the target language (i.e., a tagger not requiring manuallylabelled data in the target language). Our approach is substantially simpler than that of Das and Petrov, the current state-of-the art, yet performs comparably well. 2 Related work There is a wealth of prior research on building unsupervised POS taggers. Some approaches have exploited similarities between typologically similar languages (e.g., Czech and Russian, or Telugu and Kannada) to estimate the transition probabilities for an HMM tagger for one language based on a corpus for another language (e.g., Hana et al., 2004; Feldman et al., 2006; Reddy and Sharoff, 2011). Other approaches have simultaneously tagged two languages based on alignments in a parallel corpus (e.g., Snyder et al., 2008). A number of studies have used tag projection to copy tag information from a resource-rich to a resource-poor language, based on word alignments in a parallel corpus. After alignment, the resource-rich language is tagged, and tags are projected from the source language to the target language based on the alignment (e.g., Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001 ; Das and Petrov, 2011). Das and Petrov (201 1) achieved the current state-of-the-art for unsupervised tagging by exploiting high confidence alignments to copy tags from the source language to the target language. Graph-based label propagation was used to automatically produce more labelled training data. First, a graph was constructed in which each vertex corresponds to a unique trigram, and edge weights represent the syntactic similarity between vertices. Labels were then propagated by optimizing a convex function to favor the same tags for closely related nodes 634 Proce dingSsof oifa, th Beu 5l1gsarti Aan,An u aglu Mste 4e-ti9n2g 0 o1f3 t.he ?c A2s0s1o3ci Aatsiosonc fioartio Cno fmorpu Ctoamtiopnuatalt Lioin gauli Lsitnicgsu,i psatgices 634–639, ModelCoverageAccuracy Many-to-1 alignments88%68% 1-to-1 alignments 68% 78% 1-to-1 alignments: Top 60k sents 91% 80% Table 1: Token coverage and accuracy of manyto-one and 1-to-1 alignments, as well as the top 60k sentences based on alignment score for 1-to-1 alignments, using directly-projected labels only. while keeping a uniform tag distribution for unrelated nodes. A tag dictionary was then extracted from the automatically labelled data, and this was used to constrain a feature-based HMM tagger. The method we propose here is simpler to that of Das and Petrov in that it does not require convex optimization for label propagation or a feature based HMM, yet it achieves comparable results. 3 Tagset Our tagger exploits the idea ofprojecting tag information from a resource-rich to resource-poor language. To facilitate this mapping, we adopt Petrov et al.’s (2012) twelve universal tags: NOUN, VERB, ADJ, ADV, PRON (pronouns), DET (de- terminers and articles), ADP (prepositions and postpositions), NUM (numerals), CONJ (conjunctions), PRT (particles), “.” (punctuation), and X (all other categories, e.g., foreign words, abbreviations). These twelve basic tags are common across taggers for most languages. Adopting a universal tagset avoids the need to map between a variety of different, languagespecific tagsets. Furthermore, it makes it possible to apply unsupervised tagging methods to languages for which no tagset is available, such as Telugu and Vietnamese. 4 A Simpler Unsupervised POS Tagger Here we describe our proposed tagger. The key idea is to maximize the amount of information gleaned from the source language, while limiting the amount of noise. We describe the seed model and then explain how it is successively refined through self-training and revision. 4.1 Seed Model The first step is to construct a seed tagger from directly-projected labels. Given a parallel corpus for a source and target language, Algorithm 1provides a method for building an unsupervised tagger for the target language. In typical applications, the source language would be a better-resourced language having a tagger, while the target language would be lesser-resourced, lacking a tagger and large amounts of manually POS-labelled data. Algorithm 1 Build seed model Algorithm 1Build seed model 1:Tag source side. 2: Word align the corpus with Giza++ and remove the many-to-one mappings. 3: Project tags from source to target using the remaining 1-to-1 alignments. 4: Select the top n sentences based on sentence alignment score. 5: Estimate emission and transition probabilities. 6: Build seed tagger T. We eliminate many-to-one alignments (Step 2). Keeping these would give more POS-tagged tokens for the target side, but also introduce noise. For example, suppose English and French were the source and target language, respectively. In this case alignments such as English laws (NNS) to French les (DT) lois (NNS) would be expected (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001). However, in Step 3, where tags are projected from the source to target language, this would incorrectly tag French les as NN. We build a French tagger based on English– French data from the Europarl Corpus (Koehn, 2005). We also compare the accuracy and coverage of the tags obtained through direct projection using the French Melt POS tagger (Denis and Sagot, 2009). Table 1confirms that the one-to-one alignments indeed give higher accuracy but lower coverage than the many-to-one alignments. At this stage of the model we hypothesize that highconfidence tags are important, and hence eliminate the many-to-one alignments. In Step 4, in an effort to again obtain higher quality target language tags from direct projection, we eliminate all but the top n sentences based on their alignment scores, as provided by the aligner via IBM model 3. We heuristically set this cutoff × to 60k to balance the accuracy and size of the seed model.1 Returning to our preliminary English– French experiments in Table 1, this process gives improvements in both accuracy and coverage.2 1We considered values in the range 60–90k, but this choice had little impact on the accuracy of the model. 2We also considered using all projected labels for the top 60k sentences, not just 1-to-1 alignments, but in preliminary experiments this did not perform as well, possibly due to the previously-observed problems with many-to-one alignments. 635 The number of parameters for the emission probability is |V | |T| where V is the vocabulary and aTb iilsi ttyh eis tag |s e×t. TTh| ew htrearnesi Vtio ins probability, on atnhed other hand, has only |T|3 parameters for the trigram hmaondde,l we use. TB|ecause of this difference in number of parameters, in step 5, we use different strategies to estimate the emission and transition probabilities. The emission probability is estimated from all 60k selected sentences. However, for the transition probability, which has less parameters, we again focus on “better” sentences, by estimating this probability from only those sen- tences that have (1) token coverage > 90% (based on direct projection of tags from the source language), and (2) length > 4 tokens. These criteria aim to identify longer, mostly-tagged sentences, which we hypothesize are particularly useful as training data. In the case of our preliminary English–French experiments, roughly 62% of the 60k selected sentences meet these criteria and are used to estimate the transition probability. For unaligned words, we simply assign a random POS and very low probability, which does not substantially affect transition probability estimates. In Step 6 we build a tagger by feeding the estimated emission and transition probabilities into the TNT tagger (Brants, 2000), an implementation of a trigram HMM tagger. 4.2 Self training and revision For self training and revision, we use the seed model, along with the large number of target language sentences available that have been partially tagged through direct projection, in order to build a more accurate tagger. Algorithm 2 describes this process of self training and revision, and assumes that the parallel source–target corpus has been word aligned, with many-to-one alignments removed, and that the sentences are sorted by alignment score. In contrast to Algorithm 1, all sentences are used, not just the 60k sentences with the highest alignment scores. We believe that sentence alignment score might correspond to difficulty to tag. By sorting the sentences by alignment score, sentences which are more difficult to tag are tagged using a more mature model. Following Algorithm 1, we divide sentences into blocks of 60k. In step 3 the tagged block is revised by comparing the tags from the tagger with those obtained through direct projection. Suppose source Algorithm 2 Self training and revision 1:Divide target language sentences into blocks of n sentences. 2: Tag the first block with the seed tagger. 3: Revise the tagged block. 4: Train a new tagger on the tagged block. 5: Add the previous tagger’s lexicon to the new tagger. 6: Use the new tagger to tag the next block. 7: Goto 3 and repeat until all blocks are tagged. language word wis is aligned with target language word wjt with probability p(wjt |wsi), Tis is the tag for wis using the tagger availa|bwle for the source language, and Tjt is the tag for wjt using the tagger learned for the > S, where S is a threshold which we heuristically set to 0.7, we replace Tjt by Tis. Self-training can suffer from over-fitting, in which errors in the original model are repeated and amplified in the new model (McClosky et al., 2006). To avoid this, we remove the tag of any token that the model is uncertain of, i.e., if p(wjt |wsi) < S and Tjt Tis then Tjt = Null. So, on th|ew target side, aligned words have a tag from direct projection or no tag, and unaligned words have a tag assigned by our model. Step 4 estimates the emission and transition target language. If p(wtj|wis) = probabilities as in Algorithm 1. In Step 5, emission probabilities for lexical items in the previous model, but missing from the current model, are added to the current model. Later models therefore take advantage of information from earlier models, and have wider coverage. 5 Experimental Results Using parallel data from Europarl (Koehn, 2005) we apply our method to build taggers for the same eight target languages as Das and Petrov (201 1) Danish, Dutch, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish with English as the source language. Our training data (Europarl) is a subset of the training data of Das and Petrov (who also used the ODS United Nations dataset which we were unable to obtain). The evaluation metric and test data are the same as that used by Das and Petrov. Our results are comparable to theirs, although our system is penalized by having less training data. We tag the source language with the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003). — — 636 DanishDutchGermanGreekItalianPortugueseSpanishSwedishAverage Seed model83.781.183.677.878.684.981.478.981.3 Self training + revision 85.6 84.0 85.4 80.4 81.4 86.3 83.3 81.0 83.4 Das and Petrov (2011) 83.2 79.5 82.8 82.5 86.8 87.9 84.2 80.5 83.4 Table 2: Token-level POS tagging accuracy for our seed model, self training and revision, and the method of Das and Petrov (201 1).

Table 2 shows results for our seed model, self training and revision, and the results reported by Das and Petrov. Self training and revision improve the accuracy for every language over the seed model, and gives an average improvement of roughly two percentage points. The average accuracy of self training and revision is on par with that reported by Das and Petrov. On individual languages, self training and revision and the method of Das and Petrov are split each performs better on half of the cases. Interestingly, our method achieves higher accuracies on Germanic languages the family of our source language, English while Das and Petrov perform better on Romance languages. This might be because our model relies on alignments, which might be more accurate for more-related languages, whereas Das and Petrov additionally rely on label propagation. Compared to Das and Petrov, our model performs poorest on Italian, in terms of percentage point difference in accuracy. Figure 1 (left panel) shows accuracy, accuracy on known words, accuracy on unknown words, and proportion of known tokens for each iteration of our model for Italian; iteration 0 is the seed model, and iteration 3 1 is the final model. Our model performs poorly on unknown words as indicated by the low accuracy on unknown words, and high accuracy on known — — — words compared to the overall accuracy. The poor performance on unknown words is expected because we do not use any language-specific rules to handle this case. Moreover, on average for the final model, approximately 10% of the test data tokens are unknown. One way to improve the performance of our tagger might be to reduce the proportion of unknown words by using a larger training corpus, as Das and Petrov did. We examine the impact of self-training and revision over training iterations. We find that for all languages, accuracy rises quickly in the first 5–6 iterations, and then subsequently improves only slightly. We exemplify this in Figure 1 (right panel) for Dutch. (Findings are similar for other languages.) Although accuracy does not increase much in later iterations, they may still have some benefit as the vocabulary size continues to grow. 6 Conclusion We have proposed a method for unsupervised POS tagging that performs on par with the current state- of-the-art (Das and Petrov, 2011), but is substantially less-sophisticated (specifically not requiring convex optimization or a feature-based HMM). The complexity of our algorithm is O(nlogn) compared to O(n2) for that of Das and Petrov 637 (201 1) where n is the size of training data.3 We made our code are available for download.4 In future work we intend to consider using a larger training corpus to reduce the proportion of unknown tokens and improve accuracy. Given the improvements of our model over that of Das and Petrov on languages from the same family as our source language, and the observation of Snyder et al. (2008) that a better tagger can be learned from a more-closely related language, we also plan to consider strategies for selecting an appropriate source language for a given target language. Using our final model with unsupervised HMM methods might improve the final performance too, i.e. use our final model as the initial state for HMM, then experiment with differ- ent inference algorithms such as Expectation Maximization (EM), Variational Bayers (VB) or Gibbs sampling (GS).5 Gao and Johnson (2008) compare EM, VB and GS for unsupervised English POS tagging. In many cases, GS outperformed other methods, thus we would like to try GS first for our model. 7 Acknowledgements This work is funded by Erasmus Mundus European Masters Program in Language and Communication Technologies (EM-LCT) and by the Czech Science Foundation (grant no.

<p>Author: Mo Yu ; Tiejun Zhao ; Yalong Bai ; Hao Tian ; Dianhai Yu</p><p>Abstract: Cross-lingual projection methods can benefit from resource-rich languages to improve performances of NLP tasks in resources-scarce languages. However, these methods confronted the difficulty of syntactic differences between languages especially when the pair of languages varies greatly. To make the projection method well-generalize to diverse languages pairs, we enhance the projection method based on word alignments by introducing target-language word representations as features and proposing a novel noise removing method based on these word representations. Experiments showed that our methods improve the performances greatly on projections between English and Chinese.</p><p>3 0.74162745 <a title="323-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Enhanced_and_Portable_Dependency_Projection_Algorithms_Using_Interlinear_Glossed_Text.html">136 acl-2013-Enhanced and Portable Dependency Projection Algorithms Using Interlinear Glossed Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan Georgi ; Fei Xia ; William D. Lewis</p><p>Abstract: As most of the world’s languages are under-resourced, projection algorithms offer an enticing way to bootstrap the resources available for one resourcepoor language from a resource-rich language by means of parallel text and word alignment. These algorithms, however, make the strong assumption that the language pairs share common structures and that the parse trees will resemble one another. This assumption is useful but often leads to errors in projection. In this paper, we will address this weakness by using trees created from instances of Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT) to discover patterns of divergence between the lan- guages. We will show that this method improves the performance of projection algorithms significantly in some languages by accounting for divergence between languages using only the partial supervision of a few corrected trees.</p><p>4 0.69062662 <a title="323-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Part-of-Speech_Induction_in_Dependency_Trees_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">276 acl-2013-Part-of-Speech Induction in Dependency Trees for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

In particular, we extend the monolingual infinite tree model (Finkel et al., 2007) to a bilingual scenario: each hidden state (POS tag) of a source-side dependency tree emits a source word together with its aligned target word, either jointly (joint model), or independently (independent model). Evaluations of Japanese-to-English translation on the NTCIR-9 data show that our induced Japanese POS tags for dependency trees improve the performance of a forest- to-string SMT system. Our independent model gains over 1 point in BLEU by resolving the sparseness problem introduced in the joint model.</p><p>5 0.68284297 <a title="323-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Addressing_Ambiguity_in_Unsupervised_Part-of-Speech_Induction_with_Substitute_Vectors.html">39 acl-2013-Addressing Ambiguity in Unsupervised Part-of-Speech Induction with Substitute Vectors</a></p>
<p>Author: Volkan Cirik</p><p>Abstract: We study substitute vectors to solve the part-of-speech ambiguity problem in an unsupervised setting. Part-of-speech tagging is a crucial preliminary process in many natural language processing applications. Because many words in natural languages have more than one part-of-speech tag, resolving part-of-speech ambiguity is an important task. We claim that partof-speech ambiguity can be solved using substitute vectors. A substitute vector is constructed with possible substitutes of a target word. This study is built on previous work which has proven that word substitutes are very fruitful for part-ofspeech induction. Experiments show that our methodology works for words with high ambiguity.</p><p>6 0.68212837 <a title="323-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Real-World_Semi-Supervised_Learning_of_POS-Taggers_for_Low-Resource_Languages.html">295 acl-2013-Real-World Semi-Supervised Learning of POS-Taggers for Low-Resource Languages</a></p>

<p>Author: Alexandra Balahur ; Hristo Tanev</p><p>Abstract: Nowadays, the importance of Social Media is constantly growing, as people often use such platforms to share mainstream media news and comment on the events that they relate to. As such, people no loger remain mere spectators to the events that happen in the world, but become part of them, commenting on their developments and the entities involved, sharing their opinions and distributing related content. This paper describes a system that links the main events detected from clusters of newspaper articles to tweets related to them, detects complementary information sources from the links they contain and subsequently applies sentiment analysis to classify them into positive, negative and neutral. In this manner, readers can follow the main events happening in the world, both from the perspective of mainstream as well as social media and the public’s perception on them. This system will be part of the EMM media monitoring framework working live and it will be demonstrated using Google Earth.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.95418471 <a title="323-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Simpler_unsupervised_POS_tagging_with_bilingual_projections.html">323 acl-2013-Simpler unsupervised POS tagging with bilingual projections</a></p>
<p>Author: Long Duong ; Paul Cook ; Steven Bird ; Pavel Pecina</p><p>Abstract: We present an unsupervised approach to part-of-speech tagging based on projections of tags in a word-aligned bilingual parallel corpus. In contrast to the existing state-of-the-art approach of Das and Petrov, we have developed a substantially simpler method by automatically identifying “good” training sentences from the parallel corpus and applying self-training. In experimental results on eight languages, our method achieves state-of-the-art results. 1 Unsupervised part-of-speech tagging Currently, part-of-speech (POS) taggers are available for many highly spoken and well-resourced languages such as English, French, German, Italian, and Arabic. For example, Petrov et al. (2012) build supervised POS taggers for 22 languages using the TNT tagger (Brants, 2000), with an average accuracy of 95.2%. However, many widelyspoken languages including Bengali, Javanese, and Lahnda have little data manually labelled for POS, limiting supervised approaches to POS tagging for these languages. However, with the growing quantity of text available online, and in particular, multilingual parallel texts from sources such as multilingual websites, government documents and large archives ofhuman translations ofbooks, news, and so forth, unannotated parallel data is becoming more widely available. This parallel data can be exploited to bridge languages, and in particular, transfer information from a highly-resourced language to a lesser-resourced language, to build unsupervised POS taggers. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to POS tagging in a similar vein to the work of Das and Petrov (201 1). In this approach, — — pecina@ ufal .mff .cuni . c z a parallel corpus for a more-resourced language having a POS tagger, and a lesser-resourced language, is word-aligned. These alignments are exploited to infer an unsupervised tagger for the target language (i.e., a tagger not requiring manuallylabelled data in the target language). Our approach is substantially simpler than that of Das and Petrov, the current state-of-the art, yet performs comparably well. 2 Related work There is a wealth of prior research on building unsupervised POS taggers. Some approaches have exploited similarities between typologically similar languages (e.g., Czech and Russian, or Telugu and Kannada) to estimate the transition probabilities for an HMM tagger for one language based on a corpus for another language (e.g., Hana et al., 2004; Feldman et al., 2006; Reddy and Sharoff, 2011). Other approaches have simultaneously tagged two languages based on alignments in a parallel corpus (e.g., Snyder et al., 2008). A number of studies have used tag projection to copy tag information from a resource-rich to a resource-poor language, based on word alignments in a parallel corpus. After alignment, the resource-rich language is tagged, and tags are projected from the source language to the target language based on the alignment (e.g., Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001 ; Das and Petrov, 2011). Das and Petrov (201 1) achieved the current state-of-the-art for unsupervised tagging by exploiting high confidence alignments to copy tags from the source language to the target language. Graph-based label propagation was used to automatically produce more labelled training data. First, a graph was constructed in which each vertex corresponds to a unique trigram, and edge weights represent the syntactic similarity between vertices. Labels were then propagated by optimizing a convex function to favor the same tags for closely related nodes 634 Proce dingSsof oifa, th Beu 5l1gsarti Aan,An u aglu Mste 4e-ti9n2g 0 o1f3 t.he ?c A2s0s1o3ci Aatsiosonc fioartio Cno fmorpu Ctoamtiopnuatalt Lioin gauli Lsitnicgsu,i psatgices 634–639, ModelCoverageAccuracy Many-to-1 alignments88%68% 1-to-1 alignments 68% 78% 1-to-1 alignments: Top 60k sents 91% 80% Table 1: Token coverage and accuracy of manyto-one and 1-to-1 alignments, as well as the top 60k sentences based on alignment score for 1-to-1 alignments, using directly-projected labels only. while keeping a uniform tag distribution for unrelated nodes. A tag dictionary was then extracted from the automatically labelled data, and this was used to constrain a feature-based HMM tagger. The method we propose here is simpler to that of Das and Petrov in that it does not require convex optimization for label propagation or a feature based HMM, yet it achieves comparable results. 3 Tagset Our tagger exploits the idea ofprojecting tag information from a resource-rich to resource-poor language. To facilitate this mapping, we adopt Petrov et al.’s (2012) twelve universal tags: NOUN, VERB, ADJ, ADV, PRON (pronouns), DET (de- terminers and articles), ADP (prepositions and postpositions), NUM (numerals), CONJ (conjunctions), PRT (particles), “.” (punctuation), and X (all other categories, e.g., foreign words, abbreviations). These twelve basic tags are common across taggers for most languages. Adopting a universal tagset avoids the need to map between a variety of different, languagespecific tagsets. Furthermore, it makes it possible to apply unsupervised tagging methods to languages for which no tagset is available, such as Telugu and Vietnamese. 4 A Simpler Unsupervised POS Tagger Here we describe our proposed tagger. The key idea is to maximize the amount of information gleaned from the source language, while limiting the amount of noise. We describe the seed model and then explain how it is successively refined through self-training and revision. 4.1 Seed Model The first step is to construct a seed tagger from directly-projected labels. Given a parallel corpus for a source and target language, Algorithm 1provides a method for building an unsupervised tagger for the target language. In typical applications, the source language would be a better-resourced language having a tagger, while the target language would be lesser-resourced, lacking a tagger and large amounts of manually POS-labelled data. Algorithm 1 Build seed model Algorithm 1Build seed model 1:Tag source side. 2: Word align the corpus with Giza++ and remove the many-to-one mappings. 3: Project tags from source to target using the remaining 1-to-1 alignments. 4: Select the top n sentences based on sentence alignment score. 5: Estimate emission and transition probabilities. 6: Build seed tagger T. We eliminate many-to-one alignments (Step 2). Keeping these would give more POS-tagged tokens for the target side, but also introduce noise. For example, suppose English and French were the source and target language, respectively. In this case alignments such as English laws (NNS) to French les (DT) lois (NNS) would be expected (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001). However, in Step 3, where tags are projected from the source to target language, this would incorrectly tag French les as NN. We build a French tagger based on English– French data from the Europarl Corpus (Koehn, 2005). We also compare the accuracy and coverage of the tags obtained through direct projection using the French Melt POS tagger (Denis and Sagot, 2009). Table 1confirms that the one-to-one alignments indeed give higher accuracy but lower coverage than the many-to-one alignments. At this stage of the model we hypothesize that highconfidence tags are important, and hence eliminate the many-to-one alignments. In Step 4, in an effort to again obtain higher quality target language tags from direct projection, we eliminate all but the top n sentences based on their alignment scores, as provided by the aligner via IBM model 3. We heuristically set this cutoff × to 60k to balance the accuracy and size of the seed model.1 Returning to our preliminary English– French experiments in Table 1, this process gives improvements in both accuracy and coverage.2 1We considered values in the range 60–90k, but this choice had little impact on the accuracy of the model. 2We also considered using all projected labels for the top 60k sentences, not just 1-to-1 alignments, but in preliminary experiments this did not perform as well, possibly due to the previously-observed problems with many-to-one alignments. 635 The number of parameters for the emission probability is |V | |T| where V is the vocabulary and aTb iilsi ttyh eis tag |s e×t. TTh| ew htrearnesi Vtio ins probability, on atnhed other hand, has only |T|3 parameters for the trigram hmaondde,l we use. TB|ecause of this difference in number of parameters, in step 5, we use different strategies to estimate the emission and transition probabilities. The emission probability is estimated from all 60k selected sentences. However, for the transition probability, which has less parameters, we again focus on “better” sentences, by estimating this probability from only those sen- tences that have (1) token coverage > 90% (based on direct projection of tags from the source language), and (2) length > 4 tokens. These criteria aim to identify longer, mostly-tagged sentences, which we hypothesize are particularly useful as training data. In the case of our preliminary English–French experiments, roughly 62% of the 60k selected sentences meet these criteria and are used to estimate the transition probability. For unaligned words, we simply assign a random POS and very low probability, which does not substantially affect transition probability estimates. In Step 6 we build a tagger by feeding the estimated emission and transition probabilities into the TNT tagger (Brants, 2000), an implementation of a trigram HMM tagger. 4.2 Self training and revision For self training and revision, we use the seed model, along with the large number of target language sentences available that have been partially tagged through direct projection, in order to build a more accurate tagger. Algorithm 2 describes this process of self training and revision, and assumes that the parallel source–target corpus has been word aligned, with many-to-one alignments removed, and that the sentences are sorted by alignment score. In contrast to Algorithm 1, all sentences are used, not just the 60k sentences with the highest alignment scores. We believe that sentence alignment score might correspond to difficulty to tag. By sorting the sentences by alignment score, sentences which are more difficult to tag are tagged using a more mature model. Following Algorithm 1, we divide sentences into blocks of 60k. In step 3 the tagged block is revised by comparing the tags from the tagger with those obtained through direct projection. Suppose source Algorithm 2 Self training and revision 1:Divide target language sentences into blocks of n sentences. 2: Tag the first block with the seed tagger. 3: Revise the tagged block. 4: Train a new tagger on the tagged block. 5: Add the previous tagger’s lexicon to the new tagger. 6: Use the new tagger to tag the next block. 7: Goto 3 and repeat until all blocks are tagged. language word wis is aligned with target language word wjt with probability p(wjt |wsi), Tis is the tag for wis using the tagger availa|bwle for the source language, and Tjt is the tag for wjt using the tagger learned for the > S, where S is a threshold which we heuristically set to 0.7, we replace Tjt by Tis. Self-training can suffer from over-fitting, in which errors in the original model are repeated and amplified in the new model (McClosky et al., 2006). To avoid this, we remove the tag of any token that the model is uncertain of, i.e., if p(wjt |wsi) < S and Tjt Tis then Tjt = Null. So, on th|ew target side, aligned words have a tag from direct projection or no tag, and unaligned words have a tag assigned by our model. Step 4 estimates the emission and transition target language. If p(wtj|wis) = probabilities as in Algorithm 1. In Step 5, emission probabilities for lexical items in the previous model, but missing from the current model, are added to the current model. Later models therefore take advantage of information from earlier models, and have wider coverage. 5 Experimental Results Using parallel data from Europarl (Koehn, 2005) we apply our method to build taggers for the same eight target languages as Das and Petrov (201 1) Danish, Dutch, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish with English as the source language. Our training data (Europarl) is a subset of the training data of Das and Petrov (who also used the ODS United Nations dataset which we were unable to obtain). The evaluation metric and test data are the same as that used by Das and Petrov. Our results are comparable to theirs, although our system is penalized by having less training data. We tag the source language with the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003). — — 636 DanishDutchGermanGreekItalianPortugueseSpanishSwedishAverage Seed model83.781.183.677.878.684.981.478.981.3 Self training + revision 85.6 84.0 85.4 80.4 81.4 86.3 83.3 81.0 83.4 Das and Petrov (2011) 83.2 79.5 82.8 82.5 86.8 87.9 84.2 80.5 83.4 Table 2: Token-level POS tagging accuracy for our seed model, self training and revision, and the method of Das and Petrov (201 1).

Table 2 shows results for our seed model, self training and revision, and the results reported by Das and Petrov. Self training and revision improve the accuracy for every language over the seed model, and gives an average improvement of roughly two percentage points. The average accuracy of self training and revision is on par with that reported by Das and Petrov. On individual languages, self training and revision and the method of Das and Petrov are split each performs better on half of the cases. Interestingly, our method achieves higher accuracies on Germanic languages the family of our source language, English while Das and Petrov perform better on Romance languages. This might be because our model relies on alignments, which might be more accurate for more-related languages, whereas Das and Petrov additionally rely on label propagation. Compared to Das and Petrov, our model performs poorest on Italian, in terms of percentage point difference in accuracy. Figure 1 (left panel) shows accuracy, accuracy on known words, accuracy on unknown words, and proportion of known tokens for each iteration of our model for Italian; iteration 0 is the seed model, and iteration 3 1 is the final model. Our model performs poorly on unknown words as indicated by the low accuracy on unknown words, and high accuracy on known — — — words compared to the overall accuracy. The poor performance on unknown words is expected because we do not use any language-specific rules to handle this case. Moreover, on average for the final model, approximately 10% of the test data tokens are unknown. One way to improve the performance of our tagger might be to reduce the proportion of unknown words by using a larger training corpus, as Das and Petrov did. We examine the impact of self-training and revision over training iterations. We find that for all languages, accuracy rises quickly in the first 5–6 iterations, and then subsequently improves only slightly. We exemplify this in Figure 1 (right panel) for Dutch. (Findings are similar for other languages.) Although accuracy does not increase much in later iterations, they may still have some benefit as the vocabulary size continues to grow. 6 Conclusion We have proposed a method for unsupervised POS tagging that performs on par with the current state- of-the-art (Das and Petrov, 2011), but is substantially less-sophisticated (specifically not requiring convex optimization or a feature-based HMM). The complexity of our algorithm is O(nlogn) compared to O(n2) for that of Das and Petrov 637 (201 1) where n is the size of training data.3 We made our code are available for download.4 In future work we intend to consider using a larger training corpus to reduce the proportion of unknown tokens and improve accuracy. Given the improvements of our model over that of Das and Petrov on languages from the same family as our source language, and the observation of Snyder et al. (2008) that a better tagger can be learned from a more-closely related language, we also plan to consider strategies for selecting an appropriate source language for a given target language. Using our final model with unsupervised HMM methods might improve the final performance too, i.e. use our final model as the initial state for HMM, then experiment with differ- ent inference algorithms such as Expectation Maximization (EM), Variational Bayers (VB) or Gibbs sampling (GS).5 Gao and Johnson (2008) compare EM, VB and GS for unsupervised English POS tagging. In many cases, GS outperformed other methods, thus we would like to try GS first for our model. 7 Acknowledgements This work is funded by Erasmus Mundus European Masters Program in Language and Communication Technologies (EM-LCT) and by the Czech Science Foundation (grant no.

<p>Author: Reut Tsarfaty</p><p>Abstract: Stanford Dependencies (SD) provide a functional characterization of the grammatical relations in syntactic parse-trees. The SD representation is useful for parser evaluation, for downstream applications, and, ultimately, for natural language understanding, however, the design of SD focuses on structurally-marked relations and under-represents morphosyntactic realization patterns observed in Morphologically Rich Languages (MRLs). We present a novel extension of SD, called Unified-SD (U-SD), which unifies the annotation of structurally- and morphologically-marked relations via an inheritance hierarchy. We create a new resource composed of U-SDannotated constituency and dependency treebanks for the MRL Modern Hebrew, and present two systems that can automatically predict U-SD annotations, for gold segmented input as well as raw texts, with high baseline accuracy.</p><p>4 0.94188696 <a title="323-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Learning_Non-linear_Features_for_Machine_Translation_Using_Gradient_Boosting_Machines.html">221 acl-2013-Learning Non-linear Features for Machine Translation Using Gradient Boosting Machines</a></p>

<p>Author: Dana Movshovitz-Attias ; William W. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: Statistical language models have successfully been used to describe and analyze natural language documents. Recent work applying language models to programming languages is focused on the task of predicting code, while mainly ignoring the prediction of programmer comments. In this work, we predict comments from JAVA source files of open source projects, using topic models and n-grams, and we analyze the performance of the models given varying amounts of background data on the project being predicted. We evaluate models on their comment-completion capability in a setting similar to codecompletion tools built into standard code editors, and show that using a comment completion tool can save up to 47% of the comment typing. 1 Introduction and Related Work Statistical language models have traditionally been used to describe and analyze natural language documents. Recently, software engineering researchers have adopted the use of language models for modeling software code. Hindle et al. (2012) observe that, as code is created by humans it is likely to be repetitive and predictable, similar to natural language. NLP models have thus been used for a variety of software development tasks such as code token completion (Han et al., 2009; Jacob and Tairas, 2010), analysis of names in code (Lawrie et al., 2006; Binkley et al., 2011) and mining software repositories (Gabel and Su, 2008). An important part of software programming and maintenance lies in documentation, which may come in the form of tutorials describing the code, or inline comments provided by the programmer. The documentation provides a high level description of the task performed by the code, and may William W. Cohen Computer Science Department Carnegie Mellon University wcohen @ c s .cmu .edu include examples of use-cases for specific code segments or identifiers such as classes, methods and variables. Well documented code is easier to read and maintain in the long-run but writing comments is a laborious task that is often overlooked or at least postponed by many programmers. Code commenting not only provides a summarization of the conceptual idea behind the code (Sridhara et al., 2010), but can also be viewed as a form of document expansion where the comment contains significant terms relevant to the described code. Accurately predicted comment words can therefore be used for a variety of linguistic uses including improved search over code bases using natural language queries, code categorization, and locating parts of the code that are relevant to a specific topic or idea (Tseng and Juang, 2003; Wan et al., 2007; Kumar and Carterette, 2013; Shepherd et al., 2007; Rastkar et al., 2011). A related and well studied NLP task is that of predicting natural language caption and commentary for images and videos (Blei and Jordan, 2003; Feng and Lapata, 2010; Feng and Lapata, 2013; Wu and Li, 2011). In this work, our goal is to apply statistical language models for predicting class comments. We show that n-gram models are extremely successful in this task, and can lead to a saving of up to 47% in comment typing. This is expected as n-grams have been shown as a strong model for language and speech prediction that is hard to improve upon (Rosenfeld, 2000). In some cases however, for example in a document expansion task, we wish to extract important terms relevant to the code regardless of local syntactic dependencies. We hence also evaluate the use of LDA (Blei et al., 2003) and link-LDA (Erosheva et al., 2004) topic models, which are more relevant for the term ex- traction scenario. We find that the topic model performance can be improved by distinguishing code and text tokens in the code. 35 Proce dinSgosfi oa,f tB huel 5g1arsita, An Anu gauls Mt 4e-e9ti n2g01 o3f. th ?c e2 A0s1s3oc Aiastsio cnia fotiron C fo mrp Cuotmatpiounta tlio Lninaglu Li sntgicusi,s ptaicgses 35–40, 2 Method 2.1 Models We train n-gram models (n = 1, 2, 3) over source code documents containing sequences of combined code and text tokens from multiple training datasets (described below). We use the Berkeley Language Model package (Pauls and Klein, 2011) with absolute discounting (Kneser-Ney smoothing; (1995)) which includes a backoff strategy to lower-order n-grams. Next, we use LDA topic models (Blei et al., 2003) trained on the same data, with 1, 5, 10 and 20 topics. The joint distribution of a topic mixture θ, and a set of N topics z, for a single source code document with N observed word tokens, d = {wi}iN=1, given the Dirichlet parameters α sa,n dd β, {isw th}erefore p(θ, z, w|α, β) = p(θ|α) Yp(z|θ)p(w|z, (1) β) Yw Under the models described so far, there is no distinction between text and code tokens. Finally, we consider documents as having a mixed membership of two entity types, code and text tokens, d = where tthexet text ws,o drd =s are tok}ens f,r{owm comment and string literals, and the code words include the programming language syntax tokens (e.g., publ ic, private, for, etc’ ) and all identifiers. In this case, we train link-LDA models (Erosheva et al., 2004) with 1, 5, 10 and 20 topics. Under the linkLDA model, the mixed-membership joint distribution of a topic mixture, words and topics is then ({wciode}iC=n1, {witext}iT=n1), p(θ, z, w|α, β) = p(θ|α) Y wYtext · p(ztext|θ)p(wtext|ztext,β)· (2) Y p(zcode|θ)p(wcode|zcode,β) wYcode where θ is the joint topic distribution, w is the set of observed document words, ztext is a topic associated with a text word, and zcode a topic associated with a code word. The LDA and link-LDA models use Gibbs sampling (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004) for topic inference, based on the implementation of Balasubramanyan and Cohen (201 1) with single or multiple entities per document, respectively. 2.2 Testing Methodology Our goal is to predict the tokens of the JAVA class comment (the one preceding the class definition) in each of the test files. Each of the models described above assigns a probability to the next comment token. In the case of n-grams, the probability of a token word wi is given by considering previous words p(wi |wi−1 , . . . , w0). This probability is estimated given the previous n 1tokens as p(wi|wi−1, wi−(n−1)). For t|hwe topic models, we separate the docu- ..., − ment tokens into the class definition and the comment we wish to predict. The set of tokens of the class comment are all considered as text tokens. The rest of the tokens in the document are considered to be the class definition, and they may contain both code and text tokens (from string literals and other comments in the source file). We then compute the posterior probability of document topics by solving the following inference problem conditioned on the tokens wc, wr, wr p(θ,zr|wr,α,β) =p(θp,(zwr,rw|αr,|αβ),β) (3) This gives us an estimate of the document distribution, θ, with which we infer the probability of the comment tokens as p(wc|θ,β) = Xp(wc|z,β)p(z|θ) (4) Xz Following Blei et al. (2003), for the case of a single entity LDA, the inference problem from equation (3) can be solved by considering p(θ, z, w|α, β), as in equation (1), and by taking tph(eθ marginal )di,s atrsib iunti eoqnu aotfio othne ( 1d)o,c aunmde bnyt t toakkeinngs as a continuous mixture distribution for the set w = by integrating over θ and summing over the set of topics z wr, p(w|α,β) =Zp(θ|α)· (5) YwXzp(z|θ)p(w|z,β)!dθ For the case of link-LDA where the document is comprised of two entities, in our case code tokens and text tokens, we can consider the mixedmembership joint distribution θ, as in equation (2), and similarly the marginal distribution p(w|α, β) over bimoithla rclyod teh ean mda tregxint tlok deisntsri bfruotmion w pr(.w |Sαi,nβce) comment words in are all considered as text tokens they are sampled using text topics, namely ztext, in equation (4). wc 36 3 Experimental Settings 3.1 Data and Training Methodology We use source code from nine open source JAVA projects: Ant, Cassandra, Log4j, Maven, MinorThird, Batik, Lucene, Xalan and Xerces. For each project, we divide the source files into a training and testing dataset. Then, for each project in turn, we consider the following three main training scenarios, leading to using three training datasets. To emulate a scenario in which we are predicting comments in the middle of project development, we can use data (documented code) from the same project. In this case, we use the in-project training dataset (IN). Alternatively, if we train a comment prediction model at the beginning of the development, we need to use source files from other, possibly related projects. To analyze this scenario, for each of the projects above we train models using an out-of-project dataset (OUT) containing data from the other eight projects. Typically, source code files contain a greater amount ofcode versus comment text. Since we are interested in predicting comments, we consider a third training data source which contains more English text as well as some code segments. We use data from the popular Q&A; website StackOverflow (SO) where users ask and answer technical questions about software development, tools, algorithms, etc’ . We downloaded a dataset of all actions performed on the site since it was launched in August 2008 until August 2012. The data includes 3,453,742 questions and 6,858,133 answers posted by 1,295,620 users. We used only posts that are tagged as JAVA related questions and answers. All the models for each project are then tested on the testing set of that project. We report results averaged over all projects in Table 1. Source files were tokenized using the Eclipse JDT compiler tools, separating code tokens and identifiers. Identifier names (of classes, methods and variables), were further tokenized by camel case notation (e.g., ’minMargin’ was converted to ’min margin’). Non alpha-numeric tokens (e.g., dot, semicolon) were discarded from the code, as well as numeric and single character literals. Text from comments or any string literals within the code were further tokenized with the Mallet statistical natural language processing package (Mc- Callum, 2002). Posts from SO were parsed using the Apache Tika toolkit1 and then tokenized with the Mallet package. We considered as raw code tokens anything labeled using a   markup (as indicated by the SO users who wrote the post). 3.2 Evaluation Since our models are trained using various data sources the vocabularies used by each of them are different, making the comment likelihood given by each model incomparable due to different sets of out-of-vocabulary tokens. We thus evaluate models using a character saving metric which aims at quantifying the percentage of characters that can be saved by using the model in a word-completion settings, similar to standard code completion tools built into code editors. For a comment word with n characters, w = w1, . . . , wn, we predict the two most likely words given each model filtered by the first 0, . . . , n characters ofw. Let k be the minimal ki for which w is in the top two predicted word tokens where tokens are filtered by the first ki characters. Then, the number of saved characters for w is n k. In Table 1we report the average percentage o−f ksa.v Iend T Tcahbalera 1cte wrse per ocrotm thmee avnet using eearcchen not-f the above models. The final results are also averaged over the nine input projects. As an example, in the predicted comment shown in Table 2, taken from the project Minor-Third, the token entity is the most likely token according to the model SO trigram, out of tokens starting with the prefix ’en’ . The saved characters in this case are ’tity’ . − 4 Results Table 1 displays the average percentage of characters saved per class comment using each of the models. Models trained on in-project data (IN) perform significantly better than those trained on another data source, regardless of the model type, with an average saving of 47. 1% characters using a trigram model. This is expected, as files from the same project are likely to contain similar comments, and identifier names that appear in the comment of one class may appear in the code of another class in the same project. Clearly, in-project data should be used when available as it improves comment prediction leading to an average increase of between 6% for the worst model (26.6 for OUT unigram versus 33.05 for IN) and 14% for the best (32.96 for OUT trigram versus 47. 1for IN). 1http://tika.apache.org/ 37 Model n / topics n-gram LDA Link-LDA 1 2 3 20 10 5 1 20 10 5 1 IN 33.05 (3.62) 43.27 (5.79) 47.1 (6.87) 34.20 (3.63) 33.93 (3.67) 33.63 (3.67) 33.05 (3.62) 35.76 (3.95) 35.81 (4.12) 35.37 (3.98) 34.59 (3.92) OUT 26.6 (3.37) 31.52 (4.17) 32.96 (4.33) 26.79 (3.26) 26.8 (3.36) 26.86 (3.44) 26.6 (3.37) 28.03 (3.60) 28 (3.56) 28 (3.67) 27.82 (3.62) SO 27.8 (3.51) 33.29 (4.40) 34.56 (4.78) 27.25 (3.67) 27.22 (3.44) 27.34 (3.55) 27.8 (3.51) 28.08 (3.48) 28.12 (3.58) 27.94 (3.56) 27.9 (3.45) Table 1: Average percentage of characters saved per comment using n-gram, LDA and link-LDA models trained on three training sets: IN, OUT, and SO.

Saved characters are underlined. Of the out-of-project data sources, models using a greater amount of text (SO) mostly outperformed models based on more code (OUT). This increase in performance, however, comes at a cost of greater run-time due to the larger word dictionary associated with the SO data. Note that in the scope of this work we did not investigate the contribution of each of the background projects used in OUT, and how their relevance to the target prediction project effects their performance. The trigram model shows the best performance across all training data sources (47% for IN, 32% for OUT and 34% for SO). Amongst the tested topic models, link-LDA models which distinguish code and text tokens perform consistently better than simple LDA models in which all tokens are considered as text. We did not however find a correlation between the number of latent topics learned by a topic model and its performance. In fact, for each of the data sources, a different num- ber of topics gave the optimal character saving results. Note that in this work, all topic models are based on unigram tokens, therefore their results are most comparable with that of the unigram in Dataset n-gram link-LDA IN 2778.35 574.34 OUT 1865.67 670.34 SO 1898.43 638.55 Table 3: Average words per project for which each tested model completes the word better than the other. This indicates that each of the models is better at predicting a different set of comment words. Table 1, which does not benefit from the backoff strategy used by the bigram and trigram models. By this comparison, the link-LDA topic model proves more successful in the comment prediction task than the simpler models which do not distin- guish code and text tokens. Using n-grams without backoff leads to results significantly worse than any of the presented models (not shown). Table 2 shows a sample comment segment for which words were predicted using trigram models from all training sources and an in-project linkLDA. The comment is taken from the TrainExtractor class in the Minor-Third project, a machine learning library for annotating and categorizing text. Both IN models show a clear advantage in completing the project-specific word Train, compared to models based on out-of-project data (OUT and SO). Interestingly, in this example the trigram is better at completing the term namedentity given the prefix named. However, the topic model is better at completing the word extractor which refers to the target class. This example indicates that each model type may be more successful in predicting different comment words, and that combining multiple models may be advantageous. 38 This can also be seen by the analysis in Table 3 where we compare the average number of words completed better by either the best n-gram or topic model given each training dataset. Again, while n-grams generally complete more words better, a considerable portion of the words is better completed using a topic model, further motivating a hybrid solution. 5 Conclusions We analyze the use of language models for predicting class comments for source file documents containing a mixture of code and text tokens. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of using language models for comment completion, showing a saving of up to 47% of the comment characters. When available, using in-project training data proves significantly more successful than using out-of-project data. However, we find that when using out-of-project data, a dataset based on more words than code performs consistently better. The results also show that different models are better at predicting different comment words, which motivates a hybrid solution combining the advantages of multiple models.

</p><p>3 1 Introduction Text segmentation is the task of splitting text into segments by placing boundaries within it. [sent-6, score-0.515]

</p><p>8 This work addresses how to best select an automatic segmenter and which segmentation metrics are most appropriate to do so. [sent-35, score-0.514]
</p><p>9 To select an automatic segmenter for a particular task, a variety of segmentation evaluation metrics have been proposed, including Pk (Beeferman and Berger, 1999, pp. [sent-36, score-0.514]
</p><p>10 Each of these metrics have a variety of flaws: Pk and WindowDiff both under-penalize errors at the beginning of segmentations (Lamprier et al. [sent-40, score-0.341]
</p><p>11 , 2007) and have a bias towards favouring segmentations with few or tightly-clustered boundaries (Niekrasz and Moore, 2010), while S produces overly optimistic values  due to its normalization (shown later). [sent-41, score-0.447]
</p><p>12 To overcome the flaws of existing text segmentation metrics, this work proposes a new series of metrics derived from an adaptation of boundary edit distance (Fournier and Inkpen, 2012, p. [sent-42, score-1.074]
</p><p>13 A confusion matrix to interpret segmentation as a classification problem is also proposed, allowing for the computation of information retrieval (IR) metrics such as precision and recall. [sent-45, score-0.54]

</p><p>15 1 Segmentation Evaluation Many early studies evaluated automatic segmenters using information retrieval (IR) metrics such as precision, recall, etc. [sent-53, score-0.344]
</p><p>16 These metrics looked at segmentation as a binary classification problem and were very harsh in their comparisons—no credit was awarded for nearly missing a boundary. [sent-54, score-0.508]
</p><p>17 Near misses occur frequently in segmentation— although manual coders often agree upon the bulk of where segment lie, they frequently disagree upon the exact position of boundaries (Artstein and Poesio, 2008, p. [sent-55, score-0.69]
</p><p>18 To attempt to overcome this issue, both Passonneau and Litman (1993) and Hearst (1993) conflated multiple manual segmentations into one that contained only those boundaries which the majority of coders agreed upon. [sent-57, score-0.6]

</p><p>21 A penalty is awarded if the window’s edges are found to be in differing or the same segments within the manual segmentation and the automatic segmentation disagrees. [sent-69, score-0.821]
</p><p>22 Measuring the proportion of windows in error allows Pk to penalize a fully missed boundary by k windows, whereas a nearly missed boundary is penalized by the distance that it is offset. [sent-71, score-0.953]
</p><p>23 5–10) identified that Pk: i) penalizes false negatives (FNs)2 more than false positives (FPs); ii) does not penalize full misses within k units of a reference boundary; iii) penalize near misses too harshly in some situations; and iv) is sensitive to internal segment size variance. [sent-74, score-1.021]
</p><p>24 Its major difference is in how it decides to penalized windows: within a window, ifthe number ofboundaries in the manual segmentation (Mij) differs from the number of boundaries in the automatic segmentation (Aij), then a penalty is given. [sent-77, score-0.88]
</p><p>25 This change better allowed WD to: i) penalize FPs and FNs more equally;3 ii) Not skip full misses; iii) Less harshly penalize near misses; and iv) Reduce its sensitivity to internal segment size variance. [sent-79, score-0.417]

</p><p>31 An n-wise trans-  position is the act of swapping the position of a boundary with an empty position such that it matches a boundary in the segmentation compared against (up to a spanning distance of nt). [sent-98, score-1.18]

<p>Author: Rohan Ramanath ; Monojit Choudhury ; Kalika Bali ; Rishiraj Saha Roy</p><p>Abstract: Query segmentation, like text chunking, is the first step towards query understanding. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of crowdsourcing for this task. Through carefully designed control experiments and Inter Annotator Agreement metrics for analysis of experimental data, we show that crowdsourcing may not be a suitable approach for query segmentation because the crowd seems to have a very strong bias towards dividing the query into roughly equal (often only two) parts. Similarly, in the case of hierarchical or nested segmentation, turkers have a strong preference towards balanced binary trees.</p><p>3 0.19523375 <a title="140-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Discriminative_Learning_with_Natural_Annotations%3A_Word_Segmentation_as_a_Case_Study.html">123 acl-2013-Discriminative Learning with Natural Annotations: Word Segmentation as a Case Study</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenbin Jiang ; Meng Sun ; Yajuan Lu ; Yating Yang ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: Structural information in web text provides natural annotations for NLP problems such as word segmentation and parsing. In this paper we propose a discriminative learning algorithm to take advantage of the linguistic knowledge in large amounts of natural annotations on the Internet. It utilizes the Internet as an external corpus with massive (although slight and sparse) natural annotations, and enables a classifier to evolve on the large-scaled and real-time updated web text. With Chinese word segmentation as a case study, experiments show that the segmenter enhanced with the Chinese wikipedia achieves sig- nificant improvement on a series of testing sets from different domains, even with a single classifier and local features.</p><p>4 0.16913214 <a title="140-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Co-regularizing_character-based_and_word-based_models_for_semi-supervised_Chinese_word_segmentation.html">82 acl-2013-Co-regularizing character-based and word-based models for semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaodong Zeng ; Derek F. Wong ; Lidia S. Chao ; Isabel Trancoso</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation (CWS) approach that co-regularizes character-based and word-based models. Similarly to multi-view learning, the “segmentation agreements” between the two different types of view are used to overcome the scarcity of the label information on unlabeled data. The proposed approach trains a character-based and word-based model on labeled data, respectively, as the initial models. Then, the two models are constantly updated using unlabeled examples, where the learning objective is maximizing their segmentation agreements. The agreements are regarded as a set of valuable constraints for regularizing the learning of both models on unlabeled data. The segmentation for an input sentence is decoded by using a joint scoring function combining the two induced models. The evaluation on the Chinese tree bank reveals that our model results in better gains over the state-of-the-art semi-supervised models reported in the literature.</p><p>5 0.16098922 <a title="140-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Parsing_Graphs_with_Hyperedge_Replacement_Grammars.html">274 acl-2013-Parsing Graphs with Hyperedge Replacement Grammars</a></p>
<p>Author: David Chiang ; Jacob Andreas ; Daniel Bauer ; Karl Moritz Hermann ; Bevan Jones ; Kevin Knight</p><p>Abstract: Hyperedge replacement grammar (HRG) is a formalism for generating and transforming graphs that has potential applications in natural language understanding and generation. A recognition algorithm due to Lautemann is known to be polynomial-time for graphs that are connected and of bounded degree. We present a more precise characterization of the algorithm’s complexity, an optimization analogous to binarization of contextfree grammars, and some important implementation details, resulting in an algorithm that is practical for natural-language applications. The algorithm is part of Bolinas, a new software toolkit for HRG processing.</p><p>6 0.15445901 <a title="140-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Does_Korean_defeat_phonotactic_word_segmentation%3F.html">128 acl-2013-Does Korean defeat phonotactic word segmentation?</a></p>

Instead of utilizing simple similarity measures and their disjoint combinations, our method directly optimizes document and entity representations for a given similarity measure. Stacked Denoising Auto-encoders are first employed to learn an initial document representation in an unsupervised pre-training stage. A supervised fine-tuning stage follows to optimize the representation towards the similarity measure. Experiment results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets without any manually designed features, even beating complex collective approaches.</p><p>4 0.69710141 <a title="140-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Identifying_Sentiment_Words_Using_an_Optimization-based_Model_without_Seed_Words.html">188 acl-2013-Identifying Sentiment Words Using an Optimization-based Model without Seed Words</a></p>

Most existing researches exploit seed words, and lead to low robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization-based model for SWI.

The goal is to identify how the participants in a discussion split into subgroups with contrasting opinions. The members of each subgroup share the same opinion with respect to the discussion topic and an opposing opinion to the members of other subgroups. We use opinion mining techniques to identify opinion expressions and determine their polarities and their targets. We opinion predictions to represent the discussion in one of two formal representations: signed attitude network or a space of attitude vectors. We identify opinion subgroups by partitioning the signed network representation or by clustering the vector space representation. We evaluate the system using a data set of labeled discussions and show that it achieves good results.</p><p>6 0.57225227 <a title="140-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-An_annotated_corpus_of_quoted_opinions_in_news_articles.html">49 acl-2013-An annotated corpus of quoted opinions in news articles</a></p>

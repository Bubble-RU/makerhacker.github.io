<p>Author: Sumire Uematsu ; Takuya Matsuzaki ; Hiroki Hanaoka ; Yusuke Miyao ; Hideki Mima</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a method of inducing wide-coverage CCG resources for Japanese. While deep parsers with corpusinduced grammars have been emerging for some languages, those for Japanese have not been widely studied, mainly because most Japanese syntactic resources are dependency-based. Our method first integrates multiple dependency-based corpora into phrase structure trees and then converts the trees into CCG derivations. The method is empirically evaluated in terms of the coverage of the obtained lexi- con and the accuracy of parsing.</p><p>3 0.30196562 <a title="347-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Using_CCG_categories_to_improve_Hindi_dependency_parsing.html">372 acl-2013-Using CCG categories to improve Hindi dependency parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Bharat Ram Ambati ; Tejaswini Deoskar ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: We show that informative lexical categories from a strongly lexicalised formalism such as Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) can improve dependency parsing of Hindi, a free word order language. We first describe a novel way to obtain a CCG lexicon and treebank from an existing dependency treebank, using a CCG parser. We use the output of a supertagger trained on the CCGbank as a feature for a state-of-the-art Hindi dependency parser (Malt). Our results show that using CCG categories improves the accuracy of Malt on long distance dependencies, for which it is known to have weak rates of recovery.</p><p>4 0.23761636 <a title="347-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Transfer_Learning_for_Constituency-Based_Grammars.html">357 acl-2013-Transfer Learning for Constituency-Based Grammars</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuan Zhang ; Regina Barzilay ; Amir Globerson</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of cross-formalism transfer in parsing. We are interested in parsing constituencybased grammars such as HPSG and CCG using a small amount of data specific for the target formalism, and a large quantity of coarse CFG annotations from the Penn Treebank. While all of the target formalisms share a similar basic syntactic structure with Penn Treebank CFG, they also encode additional constraints and semantic features. To handle this apparent discrepancy, we design a probabilistic model that jointly generates CFG and target formalism parses. The model includes features of both parses, allowing trans- fer between the formalisms, while preserving parsing efficiency. We evaluate our approach on three constituency-based grammars CCG, HPSG, and LFG, augmented with the Penn Treebank-1. Our experiments show that across all three formalisms, the target parsers significantly benefit from the coarse annotations.1 â€”</p><p>5 0.21502684 <a title="347-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Compositional-ly_Derived_Representations_of_Morphologically_Complex_Words_in_Distributional_Semantics.html">87 acl-2013-Compositional-ly Derived Representations of Morphologically Complex Words in Distributional Semantics</a></p>
<p>Author: Angeliki Lazaridou ; Marco Marelli ; Roberto Zamparelli ; Marco Baroni</p><p>Abstract: Speakers of a language can construct an unlimited number of new words through morphological derivation. This is a major cause of data sparseness for corpus-based approaches to lexical semantics, such as distributional semantic models of word meaning. We adapt compositional methods originally developed for phrases to the task of deriving the distributional meaning of morphologically complex words from their parts. Semantic representations constructed in this way beat a strong baseline and can be of higher quality than representations directly constructed from corpus data. Our results constitute a novel evaluation of the proposed composition methods, in which the full additive model achieves the best performance, and demonstrate the usefulness of a compositional morphology component in distributional semantics.</p><p>6 0.19729981 <a title="347-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Parsing_with_Compositional_Vector_Grammars.html">275 acl-2013-Parsing with Compositional Vector Grammars</a></p>

The toolkit focuses in particular on compositional meaning, and implements a number of composition methods that have been proposed in the literature. Furthermore, DISSECT can be useful to researchers and practitioners who need models of word meaning (without composition) as well, as it supports various methods to construct distributional semantic spaces, assessing similarity and even evaluating against benchmarks, that are independent of the composition infrastructure.</p><p>5 0.5533039 <a title="347-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-A_relatedness_benchmark_to_test_the_role_of_determiners_in_compositional_distributional_semantics.html">32 acl-2013-A relatedness benchmark to test the role of determiners in compositional distributional semantics</a></p>
<p>Author: Raffaella Bernardi ; Georgiana Dinu ; Marco Marelli ; Marco Baroni</p><p>Abstract: Distributional models of semantics capture word meaning very effectively, and they have been recently extended to account for compositionally-obtained representations of phrases made of content words. We explore whether compositional distributional semantic models can also handle a construction in which grammatical terms play a crucial role, namely determiner phrases (DPs). We introduce a new publicly available dataset to test distributional representations of DPs, and we evaluate state-of-the-art models on this set.</p><p>6 0.54877627 <a title="347-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Transfer_Learning_for_Constituency-Based_Grammars.html">357 acl-2013-Transfer Learning for Constituency-Based Grammars</a></p>

<p>Author: Jiajun Zhang ; Chengqing Zong</p><p>Abstract: Currently, almost all of the statistical machine translation (SMT) models are trained with the parallel corpora in some specific domains. However, when it comes to a language pair or a different domain without any bilingual resources, the traditional SMT loses its power. Recently, some research works study the unsupervised SMT for inducing a simple word-based translation model from the monolingual corpora. It successfully bypasses the constraint of bitext for SMT and obtains a relatively promising result. In this paper, we take a step forward and propose a simple but effective method to induce a phrase-based model from the monolingual corpora given an automatically-induced translation lexicon or a manually-edited translation dictionary. We apply our method for the domain adaptation task and the extensive experiments show that our proposed method can substantially improve the translation quality. 1</p><p>4 0.79419959 <a title="347-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Named_Entity_Recognition_using_Cross-lingual_Resources%3A_Arabic_as_an_Example.html">256 acl-2013-Named Entity Recognition using Cross-lingual Resources: Arabic as an Example</a></p>
<p>Author: Kareem Darwish</p><p>Abstract: Some languages lack large knowledge bases and good discriminative features for Name Entity Recognition (NER) that can generalize to previously unseen named entities. One such language is Arabic, which: a) lacks a capitalization feature; and b) has relatively small knowledge bases, such as Wikipedia. In this work we address both problems by incorporating cross-lingual features and knowledge bases from English using cross-lingual links. We show that such features have a dramatic positive effect on recall. We show the effectiveness of cross-lingual features and resources on a standard dataset as well as on two new test sets that cover both news and microblogs. On the standard dataset, we achieved a 4.1% relative improvement in Fmeasure over the best reported result in the literature. The features led to improvements of 17.1% and 20.5% on the new news and mi- croblogs test sets respectively.</p><p>5 0.7924093 <a title="347-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Translating_Dialectal_Arabic_to_English.html">359 acl-2013-Translating Dialectal Arabic to English</a></p>

In contrast to previous work, we first narrow down the gap between Egyptian and MSA by applying an automatic characterlevel transformational model that changes Egyptian to EG0, which looks similar to MSA. The transformations include morphological, phonological and spelling changes. The transformation reduces the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words from 5.2% to 2.6% and gives a gain of 1.87 BLEU points.

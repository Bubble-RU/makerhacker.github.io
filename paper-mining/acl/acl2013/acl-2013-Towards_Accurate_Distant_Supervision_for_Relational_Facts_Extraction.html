<p>Author: Wei Xu ; Raphael Hoffmann ; Le Zhao ; Ralph Grishman</p><p>Abstract: Distant supervision has attracted recent interest for training information extraction systems because it does not require any human annotation but rather employs existing knowledge bases to heuristically label a training corpus. However, previous work has failed to address the problem of false negative training examples mislabeled due to the incompleteness of knowledge bases. To tackle this problem, we propose a simple yet novel framework that combines a passage retrieval model using coarse features into a state-of-the-art relation extractor using multi-instance learning with fine features. We adapt the information retrieval technique of pseudo- relevance feedback to expand knowledge bases, assuming entity pairs in top-ranked passages are more likely to express a relation. Our proposed technique significantly improves the quality of distantly supervised relation extraction, boosting recall from 47.7% to 61.2% with a consistently high level of precision of around 93% in the experiments.</p><p>3 0.24235632 <a title="352-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-HYENA-live%3A_Fine-Grained_Online_Entity_Type_Classification_from_Natural-language_Text.html">179 acl-2013-HYENA-live: Fine-Grained Online Entity Type Classification from Natural-language Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohamed Amir Yosef ; Sandro Bauer ; Johannes Hoffart ; Marc Spaniol ; Gerhard Weikum</p><p>Abstract: Recent research has shown progress in achieving high-quality, very fine-grained type classification in hierarchical taxonomies. Within such a multi-level type hierarchy with several hundreds of types at different levels, many entities naturally belong to multiple types. In order to achieve high-precision in type classification, current approaches are either limited to certain domains or require time consuming multistage computations. As a consequence, existing systems are incapable of performing ad-hoc type classification on arbitrary input texts. In this demo, we present a novel Webbased tool that is able to perform domain independent entity type classification under real time conditions. Thanks to its efficient implementation and compacted feature representation, the system is able to process text inputs on-the-fly while still achieving equally high precision as leading state-ofthe-art implementations. Our system offers an online interface where natural-language text can be inserted, which returns semantic type labels for entity mentions. Further more, the user interface allows users to explore the assigned types by visualizing and navigating along the type-hierarchy.</p><p>4 0.22284564 <a title="352-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Fine-grained_Semantic_Typing_of_Emerging_Entities.html">160 acl-2013-Fine-grained Semantic Typing of Emerging Entities</a></p>
<p>Author: Ndapandula Nakashole ; Tomasz Tylenda ; Gerhard Weikum</p><p>Abstract: Methods for information extraction (IE) and knowledge base (KB) construction have been intensively studied. However, a largely under-explored case is tapping into highly dynamic sources like news streams and social media, where new entities are continuously emerging. In this paper, we present a method for discovering and semantically typing newly emerging out-ofKB entities, thus improving the freshness and recall of ontology-based IE and improving the precision and semantic rigor of open IE. Our method is based on a probabilistic model that feeds weights into integer linear programs that leverage type signatures of relational phrases and type correlation or disjointness constraints. Our experimental evaluation, based on crowdsourced user studies, show our method performing significantly better than prior work.</p><p>5 0.14686142 <a title="352-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Entity_Linking_for_Tweets.html">139 acl-2013-Entity Linking for Tweets</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaohua Liu ; Yitong Li ; Haocheng Wu ; Ming Zhou ; Furu Wei ; Yi Lu</p><p>Abstract: We study the task of entity linking for tweets, which tries to associate each mention in a tweet with a knowledge base entry. Two main challenges of this task are the dearth of information in a single tweet and the rich entity mention variations. To address these challenges, we propose a collective inference method that simultaneously resolves a set of mentions. Particularly, our model integrates three kinds of similarities, i.e., mention-entry similarity, entry-entry similarity, and mention-mention similarity, to enrich the context for entity linking, and to address irregular mentions that are not covered by the entity-variation dictionary. We evaluate our method on a publicly available data set and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p><p>6 0.13737544 <a title="352-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Joint_Word_Alignment_and_Bilingual_Named_Entity_Recognition_Using_Dual_Decomposition.html">210 acl-2013-Joint Word Alignment and Bilingual Named Entity Recognition Using Dual Decomposition</a></p>

WebAnno offers annotation project management, freely configurable tagsets and the management of users in different roles. WebAnno uses modern web technology for visualizing and editing annotations in a web browser. It supports arbitrarily large documents, pluggable import/export filters, the curation of annotations across various users, and an interface to farming out annotations to a crowdsourcing platform. Currently WebAnno allows part-ofspeech, named entity, dependency parsing and co-reference chain annotations. The architecture design allows adding additional modes of visualization and editing, when new kinds of annotations are to be supported.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.83789974 <a title="352-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Towards_Accurate_Distant_Supervision_for_Relational_Facts_Extraction.html">352 acl-2013-Towards Accurate Distant Supervision for Relational Facts Extraction</a></p>

<p>Author: Claudiu Mihaila ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: Current domain-specific information extraction systems represent an important resource for biomedical researchers, who need to process vaster amounts of knowledge in short times. Automatic discourse causality recognition can further improve their workload by suggesting possible causal connections and aiding in the curation of pathway models. We here describe an approach to the automatic identification of discourse causality triggers in the biomedical domain using machine learning. We create several baselines and experiment with various parameter settings for three algorithms, i.e., Conditional Random Fields (CRF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF). Also, we evaluate the impact of lexical, syntactic and semantic features on each of the algorithms and look at er- rors. The best performance of 79.35% F-score is achieved by CRFs when using all three feature types.</p><p>6 0.80932873 <a title="352-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Domain-Specific_Coreference_Resolution_with_Lexicalized_Features.html">130 acl-2013-Domain-Specific Coreference Resolution with Lexicalized Features</a></p>

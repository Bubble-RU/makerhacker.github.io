</p><p>4 Using biomedical text mining technology, text can now be enriched via the addition of semantic metadata and thus can support tasks such as analysing molecular pathways (Rzhetsky et al. [sent-26, score-0.401]
</p><p>5 The notion of discourse can be defined as a coherent sequence of clauses and sentences. [sent-30, score-0.176]
</p><p>6 These are connected in a logical manner by discourse relations, such as causal, temporal and conditional, which characterise how facts in text are related. [sent-31, score-0.176]
</p><p>7 These relations can be either explicit or implicit, depending whether or not they are expressed in text using overt discourse connectives (also known as triggers). [sent-33, score-0.295]

</p><p>11 Thus, by identifying this causal relation, search engines become able to discover relations between biomedical entities and events or between experimental evidence and associated conclusions. [sent-39, score-0.919]
</p><p>12 However, phrases acting as causal triggers in certain contexts may not denote causality in all cases. [sent-40, score-1.03]
</p><p>13 In this paper, we explore several supervised machinelearning approaches to the automatic identification of triggers that actually denote causality. [sent-42, score-0.349]
</p><p>14 2  Related Work  A large amount of work related to discourse pars-  ing and discourse relation identification exists in the general domain, where researchers have not only identified discourse connectives, but also developed end-to-end discourse parsers (Pitler and Nenkova, 2009; Lin et al. [sent-43, score-0.735]
</p><p>15 , 2008), a corpus of lexically-grounded annotations of discourse relations. [sent-46, score-0.176]
</p><p>16 Until now, comparatively little work has been carried out on causal discourse relations in the biomedical domain, although causal associations between biological entities, events and processes are central to most claims of interest (Kleinberg and Hripcsak, 2011). [sent-47, score-1.682]
</p><p>17 The equivalent of the PDTB for the biomedical domain is the BioDRB corpus (Prasad et al. [sent-48, score-0.309]
</p><p>18 The number of purely causal relations annotated in this corpus is 542. [sent-52, score-0.61]
</p><p>19 There are another 23 relations which are a mixture between causality and one ofeither background, temporal, conjunction or reinforcement relations. [sent-53, score-0.202]
</p><p>20 , 2013), containing over 850 manually annotated causal discourse relations in 19 full-text open-access  journal articles from the infectious diseases domain. [sent-55, score-0.918]
</p><p>21 Using the BioDRB corpus as data, some researchers explored the identification of discourse connectives (Ramesh et al. [sent-56, score-0.276]
</p><p>22 However, they do not distinguish between the types of discourse relations. [sent-58, score-0.215]
</p><p>23 Also, they prove that there exist differences in discourse triggers between the biomedical and general domains by training a model on the BioDRB and evaluating it against PDTB and viceversa. [sent-63, score-0.803]
</p><p>24 3  Methodology  In this section, we describe our data and the features of causal triggers. [sent-64, score-0.591]
</p><p>25 BioCause is a collection of 19 openaccess full-text journal articles pertaining to the  biomedical subdomain of infectious diseases, manually annotated with causal relationships. [sent-68, score-0.94]
</p><p>26 Two types of spans of text are marked in the text, namely causal triggers and causal arguments. [sent-69, score-1.508]
</p><p>27 Each causal relation is composed of three text-bound annotations: a trigger, a cause or evidence argument and an effect argument. [sent-70, score-0.56]
</p><p>28 Some causal relations have implicit triggers, so these are excluded from the current research. [sent-71, score-0.61]
</p><p>29 Figure 1 shows an example of discourse causality from BioCause, marking the causal trigger and the two arguments with their respective relation. [sent-72, score-1.101]
</p><p>30 BioCause contains 381 unique explicit triggers in the corpus, each being used, on average, only 2. [sent-74, score-0.318]
</p><p>31 The number decreases to 347 unique triggers when they are lemmatised, corresponding to an average usage of 2. [sent-76, score-0.318]
</p><p>32 Both count settings show the diversity of causality-triggering phrases that are used in the biomedical domain. [sent-78, score-0.309]
</p><p>33 2 Features Three types of features have been employed in the development ofthis causality trigger model, i. [sent-80, score-0.435]
</p><p>34 1 Lexical features The lexical features are built from the actual tokens present in text. [sent-86, score-0.148]
</p><p>35 We included the token immediately to the left and the one immediately to the right of the current token. [sent-92, score-0.096]
</p><p>36 Firstly, in the case of tokens to the left, most triggers are found either at the beginning of the sentence (3 11instances) or are preceded by a comma (238 instances). [sent-94, score-0.365]
</p><p>37 Secondly, for the tokens to the right, almost 45% of triggers are followed by a determiner, such as the, a or an, (281 instances) or a comma (71  instances). [sent-96, score-0.396]
</p><p>38 Figure 2 depicts a partial lexical parse tree of a sentence which starts with a causal trigger, namely Our results suggest that. [sent-100, score-0.67]
</p><p>39 From the lexical parse trees, several types of features have been generated. [sent-101, score-0.15]
</p><p>40 For instance, the figure shows that the token that has the part-ofspeech IN. [sent-103, score-0.096]
</p><p>41 These features are included due to the fact that either many triggers are lexicalised as an adverb or conjunction, or are part of a verb phrase. [sent-104, score-0.349]
</p><p>42 For the same reason, the syntactical category path from the root of the lexical parse tree to the token is also included. [sent-105, score-0.235]
</p><p>43 The path also encodes, for each parent constituent, the position of the token in its subtree, i. [sent-106, score-0.096]
</p><p>44 , beginning (B), inside (I) or end (E); if the token is the only leaf node of the constituent, this is marked differently, using a C. [sent-108, score-0.127]
</p><p>45 Secondly, for each token, we extracted the pred-  Figure 2: Partial lexical parse tree of a sentence starting with a causal trigger. [sent-110, score-0.67]
</p><p>46 icate argument structure and checked whether a relation exista between the token and the previous and following tokens. [sent-111, score-0.096]
</p><p>47 Thirdly, the ancestors of each token to the third  degree are instantiated as three different features. [sent-113, score-0.154]
</p><p>48 , the root of the lexical parse tree is less than three nodes away), a ”none” value is given. [sent-116, score-0.11]
</p><p>49 For instance, the token that in Figure 2 has as its first three ancestors the constituents marked with CX, CP and VP. [sent-117, score-0.185]
</p><p>50 Finally, the lowest common ancestor in the lexical parse tree between the current token and its left neighbour has been included. [sent-118, score-0.339]
</p><p>51 In the example, the lowest common ancestor for that and suggest is VP. [sent-119, score-0.133]
</p><p>52 These last two feature types have been produced on the observation that the lowest common ancestor for all tokens in a causal trigger is S or VP in over 70% of instances. [sent-120, score-0.992]
</p><p>53 Furthermore, the percentage of cases of triggers with V or ADV as lowest common ancestor is almost 9% in each case. [sent-121, score-0.482]
</p><p>54 Also, the aver40  age distance to the lowest common ancestor is 3. [sent-122, score-0.133]
</p><p>55 3 Semantic features We have exploited several semantic knowledge sources to identify causal triggers more accurately, as a mapping to concepts and named entities acts as a back-off smoothing, thus increasing performance. [sent-125, score-0.986]
</p><p>56 All documents annotated for causality in BioCause had been previously manually annotated with biomedical named entity and event information. [sent-127, score-0.58]
</p><p>57 Moreover, another advantage of having a gold standard annotation is the fact that it is now possible to separate the task of automatic causal trigger recognition from automatic named entity recognition and event extraction. [sent-131, score-0.892]
</p><p>58 The named entity and event annotation in the BioCause corpus is used to extract information about whether a token is part of a named entity or event trigger. [sent-132, score-0.334]
</p><p>59 Furthermore, the type of the named entity or event is included as a separate feature. [sent-133, score-0.119]
</p><p>60 Using this resource, the hypernym of every token in the text has been included as a feature. [sent-135, score-0.096]
</p><p>61 Only the first sense of every token has been considered, as no sense disambiguation technique has been employed. [sent-136, score-0.096]
</p><p>62 Thus, we included a feature to say whether a token is part of a UMLS type and another for its semantic type if the previous is true. [sent-138, score-0.128]
</p><p>63 3 Experimental setup We explored with various machine learning algorithms and various settings for the task ofidentifying causal triggers. [sent-140, score-0.56]
</p><p>64 org/  s o ftware  /  crfsuit e  On the other hand, we modelled trigger detection as a classification task, using Support Vector Machines and Random Forests. [sent-146, score-0.213]
</p><p>65 A lexicon is populated with all annotated causal triggers and then this is used to tag all instances of its entries in the text as connectives. [sent-156, score-0.878]
</p><p>66 This is mainly due to triggers which are rarely used as causal triggers, such as and, by and that. [sent-160, score-0.878]
</p><p>67 Building on the previously mentioned observation about the lowest common ancestor for all tokens in a causal trigger, we built a baseline system that checks all constituent nodes in the lexical parse tree for the S, V, VP and ADV tags and marks them as causal 41  triggers. [sent-161, score-1.41]
</p><p>68 68%, largely due to the high number of intermediate nodes in the lexical parse tree that have VP  as their category. [sent-165, score-0.11]
</p><p>69 The third baseline is a combination of Dict and Dep: we consider only constituents that have the necessary category (S, V, VP or ADV) and include a trigger from the dictionary. [sent-166, score-0.213]
</p><p>70 Although the recall decreases slightly, the precision increases to almost twice that of both Dict and Dep. [sent-167, score-0.09]
</p><p>71 2 Sequence labelling task As a sequence labelling task, we have modelled causal trigger detection as two separate tasks. [sent-171, score-0.839]
</p><p>72 Firstly, each trigger is represented in the B-I-O format (further mentioned as the 3-way model). [sent-172, score-0.213]
</p><p>73 Thus, the first word of every trigger is tagged as B (begin), whilst the following words in the trigger are tagged as I(inside). [sent-173, score-0.53]
</p><p>74 Hence, a sequence of contiguous tokens  marked as part of a trigger form one trigger. [sent-177, score-0.291]
</p><p>75 sion is obtained by using the syntactic features only, reaching over 92%, almost 3% higher than when all three feature types are used. [sent-191, score-0.101]
</p><p>76 In the three-way model, syntactic and semantic features produce the best recall (almost 65%), which is just under 1% higher  than the recall when all features are used. [sent-192, score-0.154]
</p><p>77 3 Classification task As a classification task, an algorithm has to decide whether a token is part of a trigger or not, similarly to the previous two-way subtask in the case of CRF. [sent-194, score-0.309]
</p><p>78 Due to the fact that causal triggers do not have a semantic mapping to concepts in the named entity and UMLS annotations, the trees in the random forest classifier can easily produce rules that distinguish triggers from non-triggers. [sent-199, score-1.303]
</p><p>79 As such, the use of semantic features alone produce a very good precision of 84. [sent-200, score-0.092]
</p><p>80 Also, in all cases where semantic features are combined with other feature types, the precision increases by 0. [sent-202, score-0.092]
</p><p>81 Secondly, we explored the performance of SVMs in detecting causal triggers. [sent-207, score-0.56]
</p><p>82 As can be observed, the best performance is obtained when combining the lexical and semantic feature types (69. [sent-212, score-0.11]
</p><p>83 The combination of all features produces the best precision, whilst the best recall is obtained by combining lexical and semantic features. [sent-214, score-0.18]
</p><p>84 This applies to 107 trigger types, whose number offalse positives (FP) is higher  than the number of true positives (TP). [sent-217, score-0.213]
</p><p>85 In fact, 64 trigger types occur only once as a causal instance, whilst the average number of FPs for these types is 14. [sent-218, score-0.899]
</p><p>86 One such example is and, for which the number of non-causal instances (2305) is much greater than that of causal instances (1). [sent-220, score-0.56]
</p><p>87 Other examples of trigger types more commonly used as causal triggers, are suggesting (9 TP, 54 FP), indicating (8 TP, 41 FP) and resulting in (6 TP, 14 FP). [sent-221, score-0.841]
</p><p>88 (2) Buffer treated control cells showed intense green staining with syto9 (indicating viability) and a lack of PI staining (indicating no dead/dying cells or DNA release). [sent-223, score-0.088]
</p><p>89 5  Conclusions and Future Work  We have presented an approach to the automatic identification of triggers of causal discourse relations in biomedical scientific text. [sent-224, score-1.444]
</p><p>90 Shallow approaches, such as dictionary  matching and lexical parse tree matching, perform very poorly, due to the high ambiguity of causal triggers (with F-scores of approximately 15% each and 24% when combined). [sent-226, score-0.988]
</p><p>91 We have explored various machine learning algorithms that automatically classify tokens into triggers or non-triggers and we have evaluated the impact of multiple lexical, syntactic and semantic features. [sent-227, score-0.397]
</p><p>92 The performance of SVMs prove that the task of identifying causal triggers is indeed complex. [sent-228, score-0.878]
</p><p>93 As future work, integrating the causal relations in the BioDRB corpus is necessary to check whether a data insufficiency problem exists and, if so, estimate the optimal amount of necessary data. [sent-231, score-0.61]
</p><p>94 Furthermore, evaluations against the general domain need to be performed, in order to establish any differences in expressing causality in the biomedical domain. [sent-232, score-0.461]
</p><p>95 Finally, our system needs to be extended in order to identify the two arguments of  43  causal relations, the cause and effect, thus allowing the creation of a complete discourse causality parser. [sent-235, score-0.888]

<p>Author: Jong-Hoon Oh ; Kentaro Torisawa ; Chikara Hashimoto ; Motoki Sano ; Stijn De Saeger ; Kiyonori Ohtake</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore the utility of intra- and inter-sentential causal relations between terms or clauses as evidence for answering why-questions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses both intra- and inter-sentential causal relations for why-QA. We also propose a method for assessing the appropriateness of causal relations as answers to a given question using the semantic orientation of excitation proposed by Hashimoto et al. (2012). By applying these ideas to Japanese why-QA, we improved precision by 4.4% against all the questions in our test set over the current state-of-theart system for Japanese why-QA. In addi- tion, unlike the state-of-the-art system, our system could achieve very high precision (83.2%) for 25% of all the questions in the test set by restricting its output to the confident answers only.</p><p>3 0.21602362 <a title="386-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Joint_Event_Extraction_via_Structured_Prediction_with_Global_Features.html">206 acl-2013-Joint Event Extraction via Structured Prediction with Global Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Qi Li ; Heng Ji ; Liang Huang</p><p>Abstract: Traditional approaches to the task of ACE event extraction usually rely on sequential pipelines with multiple stages, which suffer from error propagation since event triggers and arguments are predicted in isolation by independent local classifiers. By contrast, we propose a joint framework based on structured prediction which extracts triggers and arguments together so that the local predictions can be mutually improved. In addition, we propose to incorporate global features which explicitly capture the dependencies of multiple triggers and arguments. Experimental results show that our joint approach with local features outperforms the pipelined baseline, and adding global features further improves the performance significantly. Our approach advances state-ofthe-art sentence-level event extraction, and even outperforms previous argument labeling methods which use external knowledge from other sentences and documents.</p><p>4 0.20345193 <a title="386-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Argument_Inference_from_Relevant_Event_Mentions_in_Chinese_Argument_Extraction.html">56 acl-2013-Argument Inference from Relevant Event Mentions in Chinese Argument Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Peifeng Li ; Qiaoming Zhu ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: As a paratactic language, sentence-level argument extraction in Chinese suffers much from the frequent occurrence of ellipsis with regard to inter-sentence arguments.

<p>Author: Man Lan ; Yu Xu ; Zhengyu Niu</p><p>Abstract: To overcome the shortage of labeled data for implicit discourse relation recognition, previous works attempted to automatically generate training data by removing explicit discourse connectives from sentences and then built models on these synthetic implicit examples. However, a previous study (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008) showed that models trained on these synthetic data do not generalize very well to natural (i.e. genuine) implicit discourse data. In this work we revisit this issue and present a multi-task learning based system which can effectively use synthetic data for implicit discourse relation recognition. Results on PDTB data show that under the multi-task learning framework our models with the use of the prediction of explicit discourse connectives as auxiliary learning tasks, can achieve an averaged F1 improvement of 5.86% over baseline models.</p><p>6 0.14306951 <a title="386-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Aggregated_Word_Pair_Features_for_Implicit_Discourse_Relation_Disambiguation.html">41 acl-2013-Aggregated Word Pair Features for Implicit Discourse Relation Disambiguation</a></p>

<p>Author: Claudiu Mihaila ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: Current domain-specific information extraction systems represent an important resource for biomedical researchers, who need to process vaster amounts of knowledge in short times. Automatic discourse causality recognition can further improve their workload by suggesting possible causal connections and aiding in the curation of pathway models. We here describe an approach to the automatic identification of discourse causality triggers in the biomedical domain using machine learning. We create several baselines and experiment with various parameter settings for three algorithms, i.e., Conditional Random Fields (CRF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF). Also, we evaluate the impact of lexical, syntactic and semantic features on each of the algorithms and look at er- rors. The best performance of 79.35% F-score is achieved by CRFs when using all three feature types.</p><p>2 0.78194529 <a title="386-lsi-2" href="./acl-2013-Why-Question_Answering_using_Intra-_and_Inter-Sentential_Causal_Relations.html">387 acl-2013-Why-Question Answering using Intra- and Inter-Sentential Causal Relations</a></p>
<p>Author: Jong-Hoon Oh ; Kentaro Torisawa ; Chikara Hashimoto ; Motoki Sano ; Stijn De Saeger ; Kiyonori Ohtake</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore the utility of intra- and inter-sentential causal relations between terms or clauses as evidence for answering why-questions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses both intra- and inter-sentential causal relations for why-QA. We also propose a method for assessing the appropriateness of causal relations as answers to a given question using the semantic orientation of excitation proposed by Hashimoto et al. (2012). By applying these ideas to Japanese why-QA, we improved precision by 4.4% against all the questions in our test set over the current state-of-theart system for Japanese why-QA. In addi- tion, unlike the state-of-the-art system, our system could achieve very high precision (83.2%) for 25% of all the questions in the test set by restricting its output to the confident answers only.</p><p>3 0.55617082 <a title="386-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Argument_Inference_from_Relevant_Event_Mentions_in_Chinese_Argument_Extraction.html">56 acl-2013-Argument Inference from Relevant Event Mentions in Chinese Argument Extraction</a></p>

<p>Author: Qi Li ; Heng Ji ; Liang Huang</p><p>Abstract: Traditional approaches to the task of ACE event extraction usually rely on sequential pipelines with multiple stages, which suffer from error propagation since event triggers and arguments are predicted in isolation by independent local classifiers. By contrast, we propose a joint framework based on structured prediction which extracts triggers and arguments together so that the local predictions can be mutually improved. In addition, we propose to incorporate global features which explicitly capture the dependencies of multiple triggers and arguments. Experimental results show that our joint approach with local features outperforms the pipelined baseline, and adding global features further improves the performance significantly. Our approach advances state-ofthe-art sentence-level event extraction, and even outperforms previous argument labeling methods which use external knowledge from other sentences and documents.</p><p>5 0.49984002 <a title="386-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Bilingual_Lexical_Cohesion_Trigger_Model_for_Document-Level_Machine_Translation.html">69 acl-2013-Bilingual Lexical Cohesion Trigger Model for Document-Level Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Sigrid Klerke ; Anders Sgaard</p><p>Abstract: We present experiments using a new unsupervised approach to automatic text simplification, which builds on sampling and ranking via a loss function informed by readability research. The main idea is that a loss function can distinguish good simplification candidates among randomly sampled sub-sentences of the input sentence. Our approach is rated as equally grammatical and beginner reader appropriate as a supervised SMT-based baseline system by native speakers, but our setup performs more radical changes that better resembles the variation observed in human generated simplifications.</p><p>3 0.74884516 <a title="386-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Identifying_English_and_Hungarian_Light_Verb_Constructions%3A_A_Contrastive_Approach.html">186 acl-2013-Identifying English and Hungarian Light Verb Constructions: A Contrastive Approach</a></p>

We also present the results of our experiments on the SzegedParalellFX English–Hungarian parallel corpus where LVCs were manually annotated in both languages. With our approach, we were able to contrast the performance of our method and define language-specific features for these typologically different languages. Our presented method proved to be sufficiently robust as it achieved approximately the same scores on the two typologically different languages.</p><p>4 0.6507498 <a title="386-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Bilingual_Data_Cleaning_for_SMT_using_Graph-based_Random_Walk.html">68 acl-2013-Bilingual Data Cleaning for SMT using Graph-based Random Walk</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Cui ; Dongdong Zhang ; Shujie Liu ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: The quality of bilingual data is a key factor in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). Low-quality bilingual data tends to produce incorrect translation knowledge and also degrades translation modeling performance. Previous work often used supervised learning methods to filter lowquality data, but a fair amount of human labeled examples are needed which are not easy to obtain. To reduce the reliance on labeled examples, we propose an unsupervised method to clean bilingual data. The method leverages the mutual reinforcement between the sentence pairs and the extracted phrase pairs, based on the observation that better sentence pairs often lead to better phrase extraction and vice versa. End-to-end experiments show that the proposed method substantially improves the performance in largescale Chinese-to-English translation tasks.</p><p>5 0.55014807 <a title="386-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Argument_Inference_from_Relevant_Event_Mentions_in_Chinese_Argument_Extraction.html">56 acl-2013-Argument Inference from Relevant Event Mentions in Chinese Argument Extraction</a></p>

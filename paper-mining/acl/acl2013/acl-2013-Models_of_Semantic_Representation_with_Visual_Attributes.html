<p>Author: Polina Kuznetsova ; Vicente Ordonez ; Alexander Berg ; Tamara Berg ; Yejin Choi</p><p>Abstract: The ever growing amount of web images and their associated texts offers new opportunities for integrative models bridging natural language processing and computer vision. However, the potential benefits of such data are yet to be fully realized due to the complexity and noise in the alignment between image content and text. We address this challenge with contributions in two folds: first, we introduce the new task of image caption generalization, formulated as visually-guided sentence compression, and present an efficient algorithm based on dynamic beam search with dependency-based constraints. Second, we release a new large-scale corpus with 1 million image-caption pairs achieving tighter content alignment between images and text. Evaluation results show the intrinsic quality of the generalized captions and the extrinsic utility of the new imagetext parallel corpus with respect to a concrete application of image caption transfer.</p><p>4 0.31410316 <a title="249-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-VSEM%3A_An_open_library_for_visual_semantics_representation.html">380 acl-2013-VSEM: An open library for visual semantics representation</a></p>

<p>Author: Shane Bergsma ; Benjamin Van Durme</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel approach for automatically predicting the hidden demographic properties of social media users. Building on prior work in common-sense knowledge acquisition from third-person text, we first learn the distinguishing attributes of certain classes of people. For example, we learn that people in the Female class tend to have maiden names and engagement rings. We then show that this knowledge can be used in the analysis of first-person communication; knowledge of distinguishing attributes allows us to both classify users and to bootstrap new training examples. Our novel approach enables substantial improvements on the widelystudied task of user gender prediction, ob- taining a 20% relative error reduction over the current state-of-the-art.</p><p>6 0.20820211 <a title="249-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-A_Visual_Analytics_System_for_Cluster_Exploration.html">29 acl-2013-A Visual Analytics System for Cluster Exploration</a></p>

<p>Author: Andreas Lamprecht ; Annette Hautli ; Christian Rohrdantz ; Tina Bogel</p><p>Abstract: This paper offers a new way of representing the results of automatic clustering algorithms by employing a Visual Analytics system which maps members of a cluster and their distance to each other onto a twodimensional space. A case study on Urdu complex predicates shows that the system allows for an appropriate investigation of linguistically motivated data. 1 Motivation In recent years, Visual Analytics systems have increasingly been used for the investigation of linguistic phenomena in a number of different areas, starting from literary analysis (Keim and Oelke, 2007) to the cross-linguistic comparison of language features (Mayer et al., 2010a; Mayer et al., 2010b; Rohrdantz et al., 2012a) and lexical semantic change (Rohrdantz et al., 2011; Heylen et al., 2012; Rohrdantz et al., 2012b). Visualization has also found its way into the field of computational linguistics by providing insights into methods such as machine translation (Collins et al., 2007; Albrecht et al., 2009) or discourse parsing (Zhao et al., 2012). One issue in computational linguistics is the interpretability of results coming from machine learning algorithms and the lack of insight they offer on the underlying data. This drawback often prevents theoretical linguists, who work with computational models and need to see patterns on large data sets, from drawing detailed conclusions. The present paper shows that a Visual Analytics system facilitates “analytical reasoning [...] by an interactive visual interface” (Thomas and Cook, 2006) and helps resolving this issue by offering a customizable, in-depth view on the statistically generated result and simultaneously an at-a-glance overview of the overall data set. In particular, we focus on the visual representa- tion of automatically generated clusters, in itself not a novel idea as it has been applied in other fields like the financial sector, biology or geography (Schreck et al., 2009). But as far as the literature is concerned, interactive systems are still less common, particularly in computational linguistics, and they have not been designed for the specific needs of theoretical linguists. This paper offers a method of visually encoding clusters and their internal coherence with an interactive user interface, which allows users to adjust underlying parameters and their views on the data depending on the particular research question. By this, we partly open up the “black box” of machine learning. The linguistic phenomenon under investigation, for which the system has originally been designed, is the varied behavior of nouns in N+V CP complex predicates in Urdu (e.g., memory+do = ‘to remember’) (Mohanan, 1994; Ahmed and Butt, 2011), where, depending on the lexical semantics of the noun, a set of different light verbs is chosen to form a complex predicate. The aim is an automatic detection of the different groups of nouns, based on their light verb distribution. Butt et al. (2012) present a static visualization for the phenomenon, whereas the present paper proposes an interactive system which alleviates some of the previous issues with respect to noise detection, filtering, data interaction and cluster coherence. For this, we proceed as follows: section 2 explains the proposed Visual Analytics system, followed by the linguistic case study in section 3. Section 4 concludes the paper. 2 The system The system requires a plain text file as input, where each line corresponds to one data object.In our case, each line corresponds to one Urdu noun (data object) and contains its unique ID (the name of the noun) and its bigram frequencies with the 109 Proce dingSsof oifa, th Beu 5l1gsarti Aan,An u aglu Mste 4e-ti9n2g 0 o1f3 t.he ?c A2s0s1o3ci Aatsiosonc fioartio Cno fmorpu Ctoamtiopnuatalt Lioin gauli Lsitnicgsu,i psatgices 109–1 4, four light verbs under investigation, namely kar ‘do’, ho ‘be’, hu ‘become’ and rakH ‘put’ ; an exemplary input file is shown in Figure 1. From a data analysis perspective, we have four- dimensional data objects, where each dimension corresponds to a bigram frequency previously extracted from a corpus. Note that more than four dimensions can be loaded and analyzed, but for the sake of simplicity we focus on the fourdimensional Urdu example for the remainder of this paper. Moreover, it is possible to load files containing absolute bigram frequencies and relative frequencies. When loading absolute frequencies, the program will automatically calculate the relative frequencies as they are the input for the clustering. The absolute frequencies, however, are still available and can be used for further processing (e.g. filtering). Figure 1: preview of appropriate file structures 2.1 Initial opening and processing of a file It is necessary to define a metric distance function between data objects for both clustering and visualization. Thus, each data object is represented through a high dimensional (in our example fourdimensional) numerical vector and we use the Euclidean distance to calculate the distances between pairs of data objects. The smaller the distance between two data objects, the more similar they are. For visualization, the high dimensional data is projected onto the two-dimensional space of a computer screen using a principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm1 . In the 2D projection, the distances between data objects in the highdimensional space, i.e. the dissimilarities of the bigram distributions, are preserved as accurately as possible. However, when projecting a highdimensional data space onto a lower dimension, some distinctions necessarily level out: two data objects may be far apart in the high-dimensional space, but end up closely together in the 2D projection. It is important to bear in mind that the 2D visualization is often quite insightful, but interpre1http://workshop.mkobos.com/201 1/java-pca- transformation-library/ tations have to be verified by interactively investigating the data. The initial clusters are calculated (in the highdimensional data space) using a default k-Means algorithm2 with k being a user-defined parameter. There is also the option of selecting another clustering algorithm, called the Greedy Variance Minimization3 (GVM), and an extension to include further algorithms is under development. 2.2 Configuration & Interaction 2.2.1 The main window The main window in Figure 2 consists of three areas, namely the configuration area (a), the visualization area (b) and the description area (c). The visualization area is mainly built with the piccolo2d library4 and initially shows data objects as colored circles with a variable diameter, where color indicates cluster membership (four clusters in this example). Hovering over a dot displays information on the particular noun, the cluster membership and the light verb distribution in the de- scription area to the right. By using the mouse wheel, the user can zoom in and out of the visualization. A very important feature for the task at hand is the possibility to select multiple data objects for further processing or for filtering, with a list of selected data objects shown in the description area. By right-clicking on these data objects, the user can assign a unique class (and class color) to them. Different clustering methods can be employed using the options item in the menu bar. Another feature of the system is that the user can fade in the cluster centroids (illustrated by a larger dot in the respective cluster color in Figure 2), where the overall feature distribution of the cluster can be examined in a tooltip hovering over the corresponding centroid. 2.2.2 Visually representing data objects To gain further insight into the data distribution based on the 2D projection, the user can choose between several ways to visualize the individual data objects, all of which are shown in Figure 3. The standard visualization type is shown on the left and consists of a circle which encodes cluster membership via color. 2http://java-ml.sourceforge.net/api/0.1.7/ (From the JML library) 3http://www.tomgibara.com/clustering/fast-spatial/ 4http://www.piccolo2d.org/ 110 Figure 2: Overview of the main window of the system, including the configuration area (a), the visualization area (b) and the description area (c). Large circles are cluster centroids. Figure 3: Different visualizations of data points Alternatively, normal glyphs and star glyphs can be displayed.

As in the representation with the glyphs, this makes similar data objects easily recognizable and comparable with each other. 2.2.3 Filtering options Our systems offers options for filtering data ac- cording to different criteria. Filter by means of bigram occurrence By activating the bigram occurrence filtering, it is possible to only show those nouns, which occur in bigrams with a certain selected subset of all features (light verbs) only. This is especially useful when examining possible commonalities. Filter selected words Another opportunity of showing only items of interest is to select and display them separately. The PCA is recalculated for these data objects and the visualization is stretched to the whole area. 111 Filter selected cluster Additionally, the user can visualize a specific cluster of interest. Again, the PCA is recalculated and the visualization stretched to the whole area. The cluster can then be manually fine-tuned and cleaned, for instance by removing wrongly assigned items. 2.2.4 Options to handle overplotting Due to the nature of the data, much overplotting occurs. For example, there are many words, which only occur with one light verb. The PCA assigns the same position to these words and, as a consequence, only the top bigram can be viewed in the visualization. In order to improve visual access to overplotted data objects, several methods that allow for a more differentiated view of the data have been included and are described in the following paragraphs. Change transparency of data objects By modifying the transparency with the given slider, areas with a dense data population can be readily identified, as shown in the following example: Repositioning of data objects To reduce the overplotting in densely populated areas, data objects can be repositioned randomly having a fixed deviation from their initial position. The degree of deviation can be interactively determined by the user employing the corresponding slider: The user has the option to reposition either all data objects or only those that are selected in advance. Frequency filtering If the initial data contains absolute bigram frequencies, the user can filter the visualized words by frequency. For example, many nouns occur only once and therefore have an observed probability of 100% for co-occurring with one of the light verbs. In most cases it is useful to filter such data out. Scaling data objects If the user zooms beyond the maximum zoom factor, the data objects are scaled down. This is especially useful, if data objects are only partly covered by many other objects. In this case, they become fully visible, as shown in the following example: 2.3 Alternative views on the data In order to enable a holistic analysis it is often valuable to provide the user with different views on the data. Consequently, we have integrated the option to explore the data with further standard visualization methods. 2.3.1 Correlation matrix The correlation matrix in Figure 4 shows the correlations between features, which are visualized by circles using the following encoding: The size of a circle represents the correlation strength and the color indicates whether the corresponding features are negatively (white) or positively (black) correlated. Figure 4: example of a correlation matrix 2.3.2 Parallel coordinates The parallel coordinates diagram shows the distribution of the bigram frequencies over the different dimensions (Figure 5). Every noun is represented with a line, and shows, when hovered over, a tooltip with the most important information. To filter the visualized words, the user has the option of displaying previously selected data objects, or s/he can restrict the value range for a feature and show only the items which lie within this range. 2.3.3 Scatter plot matrix To further examine the relation between pairs of features, a scatter plot matrix can be used (Figure 6). The individual scatter plots give further insight into the correlation details of pairs of features. 112 Figure 5: Parallel coordinates diagram Figure 6: Example showing a scatter plot matrix. 3 Case study In principle, the Visual Analytics system presented above can be used for any kind of cluster visualization, but the built-in options and add-ons are particularly designed for the type of work that linguists tend to be interested in: on the one hand, the user wants to get a quick overview of the overall patterns in the phenomenon, but on the same time, the system needs to allow for an in-depth data inspection. Both is given in the system: The overall cluster result shown in Figure 2 depicts the coherence of clusters and therefore the overall pattern of the data set. The different glyph visualizations in Figure 3 illustrate the properties of each cluster. Single data points can be inspected in the description area. The randomization of overplotted data points helps to see concentrated cluster patterns where light verbs behave very similarly in different noun+verb complex predicates. The biggest advantage of the system lies in the ability for interaction: Figure 7 shows an example of the visualization used in Butt et al. (2012), the input being the same text file as shown in Figure 1. In this system, the relative frequencies of each noun with each light verb is correlated with color saturation the more saturated the color to the right of the noun, the higher the relative frequency of the light verb occurring with it. The number of the cluster (here, 3) and the respective nouns (e.g. kAm ‘work’) is shown to the left. The user does — not get information on the coherence of the cluster, nor does the visualization show prototypical cluster patterns. Figure 7: Cluster visualization in Butt et al. (2012) Moreover, the system in Figure 7 only has a limited set of interaction choices, with the consequence that the user is not able to adjust the underlying data set, e.g. by filtering out noise. However, Butt et al. (2012) report that the Urdu data is indeed very noisy and requires a manual cleaning of the data set before the actual clustering. In the system presented here, the user simply marks conspicuous regions in the visualization panel and removes the respective data points from the original data set. Other filtering mechanisms, e.g. the removal of low frequency items which occur due to data sparsity issues, can be removed from the overall data set by adjusting the parameters. A linguistically-relevant improvement lies in the display of cluster centroids, in other words the typical noun + light verb distribution of a cluster. This is particularly helpful when the linguist wants to pick out prototypical examples for the cluster in order to stipulate generalizations over the other cluster members. 113 4 Conclusion In this paper, we present a novel visual analytics system that helps to automatically analyze bigrams extracted from corpora. The main purpose is to enable a more informed and steered cluster analysis than currently possible with standard methods. This includes rich options for interaction, e.g. display configuration or data manipulation. Initially, the approach was motivated by a concrete research problem, but has much wider applicability as any kind of high-dimensional numerical data objects can be loaded and analyzed. However, the system still requires some basic understanding about the algorithms applied for clustering and projection in order to prevent the user to draw wrong conclusions based on artifacts. Bearing this potential pitfall in mind when performing the analysis, the system enables a much more insightful and informed analysis than standard noninteractive methods. In the future, we aim to conduct user experiments in order to learn more about how the functionality and usability could be further enhanced.

<p>Author: Ahmed Salama ; Kemal Oflazer ; Susan Hagan</p><p>Abstract: We present results from our study ofwhich uses syntactically and semantically motivated information to group segments of sentences into unbreakable units for the purpose of typesetting those sentences in a region of a fixed width, using an otherwise standard dynamic programming line breaking algorithm, to minimize raggedness. In addition to a rule-based baseline segmenter, we use a very modest size text, manually annotated with positions of breaks, to train a maximum entropy classifier, relying on an extensive set of lexical and syntactic features, which can then predict whether or not to break after a certain word position in a sentence. We also use a simple genetic algorithm to search for a subset of the features optimizing F1, to arrive at a set of features that delivers 89.2% Precision, 90.2% Recall (89.7% F1) on a test set, improving the rule-based baseline by about 11points and the classifier trained on all features by about 1point in F1. 1 Introduction and Motivation Current best practice in typography focuses on several interrelated factors (Humar et al., 2008; Tinkel, 1996). These factors include typeface selection, the color of the type and its contrast with the background, the size of the type, the length of the lines of type in the body of the text, the media in which the type will live, the distance between each line of type, and the appearance of the justified or ragged right side edge of the paragraphs, which should maintain either the appearance of a straight line on both sides of the block of type (justified) or create a gentle wave on the ragged right side edge. cmu .edu hagan @ cmu .edu This paper addresses one aspect of current “best practice,” concerning the alignment of text in a paragraph. While current practice values that gentle “wave,” which puts the focus on the elegant look of the overall paragraph, it does so at the expense of meaning-making features. Meaningmaking features enable typesetting to maintain the integrity of phrases within sentences, giving those interests equal consideration with the overall look of the paragraph. Figure 1 (a) shows a text fragment typeset without any regard to natural breaks while (b) shows an example of a typesetting that we would like to get, where many natural breaks are respected. While current practice works well enough for native speakers, fluency problems for non-native speakers lead to uncertainty when the beginning and end of English phrases are interrupted by the need to move to the next line of the text before completing the phrase. This pause is a potential problem for readers because they try to interpret content words, relate them to their referents and anticipate the role of the next word, as they encounter them in the text (Just and Carpenter, 1980). While incorrect anticipation might not be problematic for native speakers, who can quickly re-adjust, non-native speakers may find inaccurate anticipation more troublesome. This problem could be more significant because English as a second language (ESL) readers are engaged not only in understanding a foreign language, but also in processing the “anticipated text” as they read a partial phrase, and move to the next line in the text, only to discover that they anticipated meaning incorrectly. Even native speakers with less skill may experience difficulty comprehending text and work with young readers suggests that ”[c]omprehension difficulties may be localized at points of high processing demands whether from syntax or other sources” (Perfetti et al., 2005). As ESL readers process a partial phrase, and move to 719 ProceedingSsof oifa, th Beu 5l1gsarti Aan,An uuaglu Mste 4e-ti9n2g 0 o1f3 t.he ?c A2s0s1o3ci Aatsiosonc fioartio Cno fmorpu Ctoamtiopnuatalt Lioinngauli Lsitnicgsu,i psatgices 719–724, the next line in the text, instances of incorrectly anticipated meaning would logically increase processing demands to a greater degree. Additionally, as readers make meaning, we assume that they don’t parse their thoughts using the same phrasal divisions “needed to diagram a sentence.” Our perspective not only relies on the immediacy assumption, but also develops as an outgrowth of other ways that we make meaning outside of the form or function rules of grammar. Specifically, Halliday and Hasan (1976) found that rules of grammar do not explain how cohesive principals engage readers in meaning making across sentences. In order to make meaning across sentences, readers must be able to refer anaphorically backward to the previous sentence, and cataphorically forward to the next sentence. Along similar lines, readers of a single sentence assume that transitive verbs will include a direct object, and will therefore speculate about what that object might be, and sometimes get it wrong. Thus proper typesetting of a segment of text must explore ways to help readers avoid incorrect anticipation, while also considering those moments in the text where readers tend to pause in order to integrate the meaning of a phrase. Those decisions depend on the context. A phrasal break between a one-word subject and its verb tends to be more unattractive, because the reader does not have to make sense of relationships between the noun/subject and related adjectives before moving on to the verb. In this case, the reader will be more likely to anticipate the verb to come. However, a break between a subject preceded by multiple adjectives and its verb is likely to be more useful to a reader (if not ideal), because the relationships between the noun and its related adjectives are more likely to have thematic importance leading to longer gaze time on the relevant words in the subject phrase (Just and Carpenter, 1980). We are not aware of any prior work for bringing computational linguistic techniques to bear on this problem. A relatively recent study (Levasseur et al., 2006) that accounted only for breaks at commas and ends of sentences, found that even those breaks improved reading fluency. While the participants in that study were younger (7 to 9+ years old), the study is relevant because the challenges those young participants face, are faced again when readers of any age encounter new and complicated texts that present words they do not know, and ideas they have never considered. On the other hand, there is ample work on the basic algorithm to place a sequence of words in a typesetting area with a certain width, commonly known as the optimal line breaking problem (e.g., Plass (1981), Knuth and Plass (1981)). This problem is quite well-understood and basic variants are usually studied as an elementary example application of dynamic programming. In this paper we explore the problem of learning where to break sentences in order to avoid the problems discussed above. Once such unbreakable segments are identified, a simple application of the dynamic programming algorithm for optimal line breaking, using unbreakable segments as “words”, easily typesets the text to a given width area. 2 Text Breaks The rationale for content breaks is linked to our interest in preventing inaccurate anticipation, which is based on the immediacy assumption. The immediacy assumption (Just and Carpenter, 1980) considers, among other things, the reader’s interest in trying to relate content words to their referents as soon as possible. Prior context also encourages the reader to anticipate a particular role or case for the next word, such as agent or the manner in which something is done.Therefore, in defining our breaks, we consider not only the need to maintain the syntactic integrity of phrases, such as the prepositional phrase, but also the semantic integrity across syntactical divisions. For example, semantic integrity is important when transitive verbs anticipate direct objects. Strictly speaking, we define a bad break as one that will cause (i) unintended anaphoric collocation, (ii) unintended cataphoric collocation, or (iii) incorrect anticipation. Using these broad constraints, we derived a set of about 30 rules that define acceptable and nonacceptable breaks, with exceptions based on context and other special cases. Some of the rules are very simple and are only related to the word posi- tion in the sentence: • • Break at the end of a sentence. Keep the first and last words of a sentence wKietehp pth teh rest sotf a aint.d The rest of the rule set are more complex and depend on the structure of the sentence in question, 720 . s anct ions and UN charge s o f gro s s right s abuse s Mi l ary tens i it ons on the Korean peninsula have risen to the i highe st level for years r with the communi st st ate under the youthful Kim threatening nuclear war in re sponse t o UN s anct i s impo s ed a ft e r it s thi rd at omi c t e st l on ast month .

Keep an appositive phrase with the noun it renames. Do not break inside a prepositional phrase. • • • Keep marooned prepositions with the word they modify. Keep the verb, the object and the preposition together ei nv a phrasal bvjeercbt phrase. Keep a gerund clause with its adverbial complement. There are exceptions to these rules in certain cases such as overly long phrases. 3 Experimental Setup Our data set consists of a modest set of 150 sentences (3918 tokens) selected from four different documents and manually annotated by a human expert relying on the 30 or so rules. The annotation consists of marking after each token whether one is allowed to break at that position or not.1 We developed three systems for predicting breaks: a rule-based baseline system, a maximumentropy classifier that learns to classify breaks us- ing about 100 lexical, syntactic and collocational features, and a maximum entropy classifier that uses a subset of these features selected by a simple genetic algorithm in a hill-climbing fashion. We evaluated our classifiers intrinsically using the usual measures: 1We expect to make our annotated data available upon the publication of the paper. • Precision: Percentage of the breaks posited tPhraetc were actually ctaogrere octf bthreeak bsre aink tshe p goldstandard hand-annotated data. It is possible to get 100% precision by putting a single break at the end. • Recall: Percentage of the actual breaks correctly posited. tIatg ies possible ttou get 1e0ak0%s c recall by positing a break after each token. F1: The geometric mean of precision and recFall divided by their average. It should be noted that when a text is typeset into an area of width of a certain number of characters, an erroneous break need not necessarily lead to an actual break in the final output, that is an error may • not be too bad. On the other hand, a missed break while not hurting the readability of the text may actually lead to a long segment that may eventually worsen raggedness in the final typesetting. Baseline Classifier We implemented a subset of the rules (those that rely only on lexical and partof-speech information), as a baseline rule-based break classifier. The baseline classifier avoids breaks: • • • after the first word in a sentence, quote or parentheses, before the last word in a sentence, quote or parentheses, asntd w between a punctuation mark following a bweotrwde or b aet wpueennct two nco nmsearckuti vfoel punctuation marks. It posits breaks (i) before a word following a punctuation, and (ii) before prepositions, auxiliary verbs, coordinating conjunctions, subordinate conjunctions, relative pronouns, relative adverbs, conjunctive adverbs, and correlative conjunctions. 721 Maximum Entropy Classifier We used the CRF++ Tool2 but with the option to run it only as a maximum entropy classifier (Berger et al., 1996), to train a classifier. We used a large set of about 100 features grouped into the following categories: • • Lexical features: These features include the tLoekxeinca aln fde athtuer ePsO:S T tag efo fre athtuer previous, current and the next word. We also encode whether the word is part of a compound noun or a verb, or is an adjective that subcategorizes a specific preposition in WordNet, (e.g., familiar with). Constituency structure features: These are Cunolnesxtiictauleinzecdy f setarutucrtuers eth faeat ttaurkees i:nt To aecsecou anret in the parse tree, for a word and its previous and next words, the labels of the parent, the grandparent and their siblings, and number of siblings they have. We also consider the label of the closest common ancestor for a word and its next word. • • Dependency structure features: These are unlDeexipceanldizeendc yfe satrtuurcteus eth faeat essentially capture the number of dependency relation links that cross-over a given word boundary. The motivation for these comes from the desire to limit the amount of information that would need to be carried over that boundary, assuming this would be captured by the number of dependency links over the break point. Baseline feature: This feature reflects Bwahseethlienre the rule-based baseline break classifier posits a break at this point or not. We use the following tools to process the sentences to extract some of these features: • Stanford constituency and dependency parsers, (De Marneffe et al., 2006; Klein and Manning, 2002; Klein and Manning, 2003), • • lemmatization tool in NLTK (Bird, 2006), WordNet for compound (Fellbaum, 1998). nouns and verbs 2Available at http : / / crfpp . googlecode .com/ svn /t runk / doc / index . html .

Basically, we start with a randomly selected set of features and through mutation and crossover try to obtain feature combinations that perform better over the development set in terms of F1 score. After a few hundred generations of this kind of hill-climbing, we get a subset of features that perform the best. 4 Results Our current evaluation is only intrinsic in that we measure our performance in getting the break and no-break points correctly in a test set. The results are shown in Table 1. The column ME-All shows the results for a maximum entropy classifier using all the features and the column ME-GA shows the results for a maximum entropy classifier using about 50 of the about 100 features available, as selected by the genetic algorithm. Our best system delivers 89.2% precision and 90.2% recall (with 89.7% F1), improving the rulebased baseline by about 11points and the classifier trained on all features by about 1point in F1. After processing our test set with the ME-GA classifier, we can feed the segments into a standard word-wrapping dynamic programming algorithm (along with a maximum width) and obtain a typeset version with minimum raggedness on the right margin. This algorithm is fast enough to use even dynamically when resizing a window if the text is displayed in a browser on a screen. Figure 1 (b) displays an example of a small fragment of text typeset using the output of our best break classifier. One can immediately note that this typesetting has more raggedness overall, but avoids the bad breaks in (a). We are currently in the process of designing a series of experiments for extrinsic evaluation to determine if such typeset text helps comprehension for secondary language learners. 722 4.1 Error Analysis An analysis of the errors our best classifier makes (which may or may not be translated into an actual error in the final typesetting) shows that the majority of the errors basically can be categorized into the following groups: • Incorrect breaks posited for multiword colloIcnatcioornrse (e.g., akcst *po of weda fr,o3r rmuulel*ti of law, far ahead* of, raining cats* and dogs, etc.) • Missed breaks after a verb (e.g., calls | an act of war, proceeded to | implement, etc.) Missed breaks before or after prepositions or aMdvisesrebdia blsre (e.g., ethfoer day after | tehpeo wsitoiroldns realized, every .kgi.n,d th | of interference) We expect to overcome such cases by increasing our training data size significantly by using our classifier to break new texts and then have a human annotator to manually correct the breaks. • 5 Conclusions and Future Work We have used syntactically motivated information to help in typesetting text to facilitate better understanding of English text especially by secondary language learners, by avoiding breaks which may cause unnecessary anticipation errors. We have cast this as a classification problem to indicate whether to break after a certain word or not, by taking into account a variety of features. Our best system maximum entropy framework uses about 50 such features, which were selected using a genetic algorithm and performs significantly better than a rule-based break classifier and better than a maximum entropy classifier that uses all available features. We are currently working on extending this work in two main directions: We are designing a set of experiments to extrinsically test whether typesetting by our system improves reading ease and comprehension. We are also looking into a break labeling scheme that is not binary but based on a notion of “badness” perhaps quantized into 3-4 grades, that would allow flexibility between preventing bad breaks and minimizing raggedness. For instance, breaking a noun-phrase right after an initial the may be considered very bad. On the other hand, although it is desirable to keep an object NP together with the preceding transitive verb, – 3* indicates a spurious incorrect break, | indicates a misse*d i nbrdeiacka.t breaking before the object NP, could be OK, if not doing so causes an inordinate amount of raggedness. Then the final typesetting stage can optimize a combination of raggedness and the total “bad- ness” of all the breaks it posits.

The toolkit focuses in particular on compositional meaning, and implements a number of composition methods that have been proposed in the literature. Furthermore, DISSECT can be useful to researchers and practitioners who need models of word meaning (without composition) as well, as it supports various methods to construct distributional semantic spaces, assessing similarity and even evaluating against benchmarks, that are independent of the composition infrastructure.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.80132473 <a title="249-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Models_of_Semantic_Representation_with_Visual_Attributes.html">249 acl-2013-Models of Semantic Representation with Visual Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Carina Silberer ; Vittorio Ferrari ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of grounding the meaning of words in the physical world and focus on the visual modality which we represent by visual attributes. We create a new large-scale taxonomy of visual attributes covering more than 500 concepts and their corresponding 688K images. We use this dataset to train attribute classifiers and integrate their predictions with text-based distributional models of word meaning. We show that these bimodal models give a better fit to human word association data compared to amodal models and word representations based on handcrafted norming data.</p><p>4 0.77021611 <a title="249-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-VSEM%3A_An_open_library_for_visual_semantics_representation.html">380 acl-2013-VSEM: An open library for visual semantics representation</a></p>
<p>Author: Elia Bruni ; Ulisse Bordignon ; Adam Liska ; Jasper Uijlings ; Irina Sergienya</p><p>Abstract: VSEM is an open library for visual semantics. Starting from a collection of tagged images, it is possible to automatically construct an image-based representation of concepts by using off-theshelf VSEM functionalities. VSEM is entirely written in MATLAB and its objectoriented design allows a large flexibility and reusability. The software is accompanied by a website with supporting documentation and examples.</p><p>5 0.76429892 <a title="249-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Dual_Training_and_Dual_Prediction_for_Polarity_Classification.html">131 acl-2013-Dual Training and Dual Prediction for Polarity Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui Xia ; Tao Wang ; Xuelei Hu ; Shoushan Li ; Chengqing Zong</p><p>Abstract: Bag-of-words (BOW) is now the most popular way to model text in machine learning based sentiment classification. However, the performance of such approach sometimes remains rather limited due to some fundamental deficiencies of the BOW model. In this paper, we focus on the polarity shift problem, and propose a novel approach, called dual training and dual prediction (DTDP), to address it. The basic idea of DTDP is to first generate artificial samples that are polarity-opposite to the original samples by polarity reversion, and then leverage both the original and opposite samples for (dual) training and (dual) prediction. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for polarity classification. 1</p><p>6 0.76373476 <a title="249-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Implicatures_and_Nested_Beliefs_in_Approximate_Decentralized-POMDPs.html">190 acl-2013-Implicatures and Nested Beliefs in Approximate Decentralized-POMDPs</a></p>

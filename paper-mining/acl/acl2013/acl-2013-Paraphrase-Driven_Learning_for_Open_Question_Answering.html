<p>Author: Chenguang Wang ; Nan Duan ; Ming Zhou ; Ming Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Mismatch between queries and documents is a key issue for the web search task. In order to narrow down such mismatch, in this paper, we present an in-depth investigation on adapting a paraphrasing technique to web search from three aspects: a search-oriented paraphrasing model; an NDCG-based parameter optimization algorithm; an enhanced ranking model leveraging augmented features computed on paraphrases of original queries. Ex- periments performed on the large scale query-document data set show that, the search performance can be significantly improved, with +3.28% and +1.14% NDCG gains on dev and test sets respectively.</p><p>3 0.23104307 <a title="272-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Question_Answering_Using_Enhanced_Lexical_Semantic_Models.html">291 acl-2013-Question Answering Using Enhanced Lexical Semantic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Wen-tau Yih ; Ming-Wei Chang ; Christopher Meek ; Andrzej Pastusiak</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the answer sentence selection problem for question answering. Unlike previous work, which primarily leverages syntactic analysis through dependency tree matching, we focus on improving the performance using models of lexical semantic resources. Experiments show that our systems can be consistently and significantly improved with rich lexical semantic information, regardless of the choice of learning algorithms. When evaluated on a benchmark dataset, the MAP and MRR scores are increased by 8 to 10 points, compared to one of our baseline systems using only surface-form matching. Moreover, our best system also outperforms pervious work that makes use of the dependency tree structure by a wide margin.</p><p>4 0.22419247 <a title="272-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Automatic_Coupling_of_Answer_Extraction_and_Information_Retrieval.html">60 acl-2013-Automatic Coupling of Answer Extraction and Information Retrieval</a></p>

<p>Author: K. Tamsin Maxwell ; Jon Oberlander ; W. Bruce Croft</p><p>Abstract: Techniques that compare short text segments using dependency paths (or simply, paths) appear in a wide range of automated language processing applications including question answering (QA). However, few models in ad hoc information retrieval (IR) use paths for document ranking due to the prohibitive cost of parsing a retrieval collection. In this paper, we introduce a flexible notion of paths that describe chains of words on a dependency path. These chains, or catenae, are readily applied in standard IR models. Informative catenae are selected using supervised machine learning with linguistically informed features and compared to both non-linguistic terms and catenae selected heuristically with filters derived from work on paths. Automatically selected catenae of 1-2 words deliver significant performance gains on three TREC collections.</p><p>6 0.68713957 <a title="272-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Question_Answering_Using_Enhanced_Lexical_Semantic_Models.html">291 acl-2013-Question Answering Using Enhanced Lexical Semantic Models</a></p>

Offline approaches have been proposed to split them using word statistics, but they rely on static lexicon, limiting their use.

<p>Author: Anne-Laure Ligozat</p><p>Abstract: Question answering systems have been developed for many languages, but most resources were created for English, which can be a problem when developing a system in another language such as French. In particular, for question classification, no labeled question corpus is available for French, so this paper studies the possibility to use existing English corpora and transfer a classification by translating the question and their labels. By translating the training corpus, we obtain results close to a monolingual setting.</p><p>5 0.83771348 <a title="272-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Non-Monotonic_Sentence_Alignment_via_Semisupervised_Learning.html">259 acl-2013-Non-Monotonic Sentence Alignment via Semisupervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaojun Quan ; Chunyu Kit ; Yan Song</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of nonmonotonic sentence alignment, motivated by the observation that coupled sentences in real bitexts do not necessarily occur monotonically, and proposes a semisupervised learning approach based on two assumptions: (1) sentences with high affinity in one language tend to have their counterparts with similar relatedness in the other; and (2) initial alignment is readily available with existing alignment techniques. They are incorporated as two constraints into a semisupervised learning framework for optimization to produce a globally optimal solution. The evaluation with realworld legal data from a comprehensive legislation corpus shows that while exist- ing alignment algorithms suffer severely from non-monotonicity, this approach can work effectively on both monotonic and non-monotonic data.</p><p>6 0.83716828 <a title="272-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-The_Role_of_Syntax_in_Vector_Space_Models_of_Compositional_Semantics.html">347 acl-2013-The Role of Syntax in Vector Space Models of Compositional Semantics</a></p>

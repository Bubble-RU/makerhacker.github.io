<p>Author: Veronika Vincze ; Istvan Nagy T. ; Richard Farkas</p><p>Abstract: Here, we introduce a machine learningbased approach that allows us to identify light verb constructions (LVCs) in Hungarian and English free texts. We also present the results of our experiments on the SzegedParalellFX English–Hungarian parallel corpus where LVCs were manually annotated in both languages. With our approach, we were able to contrast the performance of our method and define language-specific features for these typologically different languages. Our presented method proved to be sufficiently robust as it achieved approximately the same scores on the two typologically different languages.</p><p>3 0.061795767 <a title="302-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Automated_Collocation_Suggestion_for_Japanese_Second_Language_Learners.html">58 acl-2013-Automated Collocation Suggestion for Japanese Second Language Learners</a></p>
<p>Author: Lis Pereira ; Erlyn Manguilimotan ; Yuji Matsumoto</p><p>Abstract: This study addresses issues of Japanese language learning concerning word combinations (collocations). Japanese learners may be able to construct grammatically correct sentences, however, these may sound “unnatural”. In this work, we analyze correct word combinations using different collocation measures and word similarity methods. While other methods use well-formed text, our approach makes use of a large Japanese language learner corpus for generating collocation candidates, in order to build a system that is more sensitive to constructions that are difficult for learners. Our results show that we get better results compared to other methods that use only wellformed text. 1</p><p>4 0.03946685 <a title="302-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Multilingual_Affect_Polarity_and_Valence_Prediction_in_Metaphor-Rich_Texts.html">253 acl-2013-Multilingual Affect Polarity and Valence Prediction in Metaphor-Rich Texts</a></p>
<p>Author: Zornitsa Kozareva</p><p>Abstract: Metaphor is an important way of conveying the affect of people, hence understanding how people use metaphors to convey affect is important for the communication between individuals and increases cohesion if the perceived affect of the concrete example is the same for the two individuals. Therefore, building computational models that can automatically identify the affect in metaphor-rich texts like “The team captain is a rock.”, “Time is money.”, “My lawyer is a shark.” is an important challenging problem, which has been of great interest to the research community. To solve this task, we have collected and manually annotated the affect of metaphor-rich texts for four languages. We present novel algorithms that integrate triggers for cognitive, affective, perceptual and social processes with stylistic and lexical information. By running evaluations on datasets in English, Spanish, Russian and Farsi, we show that the developed affect polarity and valence prediction technology of metaphor-rich texts is portable and works equally well for different languages.</p><p>5 0.037103087 <a title="302-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Language_Acquisition_and_Probabilistic_Models%3A_keeping_it_simple.html">213 acl-2013-Language Acquisition and Probabilistic Models: keeping it simple</a></p>
<p>Author: Aline Villavicencio ; Marco Idiart ; Robert Berwick ; Igor Malioutov</p><p>Abstract: Hierarchical Bayesian Models (HBMs) have been used with some success to capture empirically observed patterns of under- and overgeneralization in child language acquisition. However, as is well known, HBMs are “ideal”learningsystems, assumingaccess to unlimited computational resources that may not be available to child language learners. Consequently, it remains crucial to carefully assess the use of HBMs along with alternative, possibly simpler, candidate models. This paper presents such an evaluation for a language acquisi- tion domain where explicit HBMs have been proposed: the acquisition of English dative constructions. In particular, we present a detailed, empiricallygrounded model-selection comparison of HBMs vs. a simpler alternative based on clustering along with maximum likelihood estimation that we call linear competition learning (LCL). Our results demonstrate that LCL can match HBM model performance without incurring on the high computational costs associated with HBMs.</p><p>6 0.036978703 <a title="302-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Exploiting_Social_Media_for_Natural_Language_Processing%3A_Bridging_the_Gap_between_Language-centric_and_Real-world_Applications.html">146 acl-2013-Exploiting Social Media for Natural Language Processing: Bridging the Gap between Language-centric and Real-world Applications</a></p>

<p>Author: Yu Sawai ; Mamoru Komachi ; Yuji Matsumoto</p><p>Abstract: We propose a verb suggestion method which uses candidate sets and domain adaptation to incorporate error patterns produced by ESL learners. The candidate sets are constructed from a large scale learner corpus to cover various error patterns made by learners. Furthermore, the model is trained using both a native corpus and the learner corpus via a domain adaptation technique. Experiments on two learner corpora show that the candidate sets increase the coverage of error patterns and domain adaptation improves the performance for verb suggestion.</p><p>4 0.63800853 <a title="302-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Automated_Collocation_Suggestion_for_Japanese_Second_Language_Learners.html">58 acl-2013-Automated Collocation Suggestion for Japanese Second Language Learners</a></p>

<p>Author: Eric T. Nalisnick ; Henry S. Baird</p><p>Abstract: We present an automatic method for analyzing sentiment dynamics between characters in plays. This literary format’s structured dialogue allows us to make assumptions about who is participating in a conversation. Once we have an idea of who a character is speaking to, the sentiment in his or her speech can be attributed accordingly, allowing us to generate lists of a character’s enemies and allies as well as pinpoint scenes critical to a character’s emotional development. Results of experiments on Shakespeare’s plays are presented along with discussion of how this work can be extended to unstructured texts (i.e. novels).</p><p>3 0.56645274 <a title="302-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Efficient_Implementation_of_Beam-Search_Incremental_Parsers.html">133 acl-2013-Efficient Implementation of Beam-Search Incremental Parsers</a></p>
<p>Author: Yoav Goldberg ; Kai Zhao ; Liang Huang</p><p>Abstract: Beam search incremental parsers are accurate, but not as fast as they could be. We demonstrate that, contrary to popular belief, most current implementations of beam parsers in fact run in O(n2), rather than linear time, because each statetransition is actually implemented as an O(n) operation. We present an improved implementation, based on Tree Structured Stack (TSS), in which a transition is performed in O(1), resulting in a real lineartime algorithm, which is verified empiri- cally. We further improve parsing speed by sharing feature-extraction and dotproduct across beam items. Practically, our methods combined offer a speedup of ∼2x over strong baselines on Penn Treeb∼a2nxk sentences, a bnads are eosrd oenrs P eofn magnitude faster on much longer sentences.</p><p>4 0.48308727 <a title="302-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Understanding_Verbs_based_on_Overlapping_Verbs_Senses.html">366 acl-2013-Understanding Verbs based on Overlapping Verbs Senses</a></p>

<p>Author: Angeliki Lazaridou ; Marco Marelli ; Roberto Zamparelli ; Marco Baroni</p><p>Abstract: Speakers of a language can construct an unlimited number of new words through morphological derivation. This is a major cause of data sparseness for corpus-based approaches to lexical semantics, such as distributional semantic models of word meaning. We adapt compositional methods originally developed for phrases to the task of deriving the distributional meaning of morphologically complex words from their parts. Semantic representations constructed in this way beat a strong baseline and can be of higher quality than representations directly constructed from corpus data. Our results constitute a novel evaluation of the proposed composition methods, in which the full additive model achieves the best performance, and demonstrate the usefulness of a compositional morphology component in distributional semantics.</p><p>6 0.48164374 <a title="302-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Generalized_Reordering_Rules_for_Improved_SMT.html">166 acl-2013-Generalized Reordering Rules for Improved SMT</a></p>

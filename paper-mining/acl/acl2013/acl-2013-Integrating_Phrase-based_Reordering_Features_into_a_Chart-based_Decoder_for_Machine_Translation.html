<p>Author: Karthik Visweswariah ; Mitesh M. Khapra ; Ananthakrishnan Ramanathan</p><p>Abstract: Preordering of a source language sentence to match target word order has proved to be useful for improving machine translation systems. Previous work has shown that a reordering model can be learned from high quality manual word alignments to improve machine translation performance. In this paper, we focus on further improving the performance of the reordering model (and thereby machine translation) by using a larger corpus of sentence aligned data for which manual word alignments are not available but automatic machine generated alignments are available. The main challenge we tackle is to generate quality data for training the reordering model in spite of the machine align- ments being noisy. To mitigate the effect of noisy machine alignments, we propose a novel approach that improves reorderings produced given noisy alignments and also improves word alignments using information from the reordering model. This approach generates alignments that are 2.6 f-Measure points better than a baseline supervised aligner. The data generated allows us to train a reordering model that gives an improvement of 1.8 BLEU points on the NIST MT-08 Urdu-English evaluation set over a reordering model that only uses manual word alignments, and a gain of 5.2 BLEU points over a standard phrase-based baseline.</p><p>4 0.23467368 <a title="200-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Advancements_in_Reordering_Models_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">40 acl-2013-Advancements in Reordering Models for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Minwei Feng ; Jan-Thorsten Peter ; Hermann Ney</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel reordering model based on sequence labeling techniques. Our model converts the reordering problem into a sequence labeling problem, i.e. a tagging task. Results on five Chinese-English NIST tasks show that our model improves the baseline system by 1.32 BLEU and 1.53 TER on average. Results of comparative study with other seven widely used reordering models will also be reported.</p><p>5 0.18366256 <a title="200-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Learning_to_Prune%3A_Context-Sensitive_Pruning_for_Syntactic_MT.html">226 acl-2013-Learning to Prune: Context-Sensitive Pruning for Syntactic MT</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenduan Xu ; Yue Zhang ; Philip Williams ; Philipp Koehn</p><p>Abstract: We present a context-sensitive chart pruning method for CKY-style MT decoding. Source phrases that are unlikely to have aligned target constituents are identified using sequence labellers learned from the parallel corpus, and speed-up is obtained by pruning corresponding chart cells. The proposed method is easy to implement, orthogonal to cube pruning and additive to its pruning power. On a full-scale Englishto-German experiment with a string-totree model, we obtain a speed-up of more than 60% over a strong baseline, with no loss in BLEU.</p><p>6 0.17588082 <a title="200-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Travatar%3A_A_Forest-to-String_Machine_Translation_Engine_based_on_Tree_Transducers.html">361 acl-2013-Travatar: A Forest-to-String Machine Translation Engine based on Tree Transducers</a></p>

<p>Author: Hendra Setiawan ; Bowen Zhou ; Bing Xiang ; Libin Shen</p><p>Abstract: Long distance reordering remains one of the greatest challenges in statistical machine translation research as the key contextual information may well be beyond the confine of translation units. In this paper, we propose Two-Neighbor Orientation (TNO) model that jointly models the orientation decisions between anchors and two neighboring multi-unit chunks which may cross phrase or rule boundaries. We explicitly model the longest span of such chunks, referred to as Maximal Orientation Span, to serve as a global parameter that constrains underlying local decisions. We integrate our proposed model into a state-of-the-art string-to-dependency translation system and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposal in a large-scale Chinese-to-English translation task. On NIST MT08 set, our most advanced model brings around +2.0 BLEU and -1.0 TER improvement.</p><p>4 0.76974821 <a title="200-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Advancements_in_Reordering_Models_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">40 acl-2013-Advancements in Reordering Models for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Nadir Durrani ; Alexander Fraser ; Helmut Schmid ; Hieu Hoang ; Philipp Koehn</p><p>Abstract: The phrase-based and N-gram-based SMT frameworks complement each other. While the former is better able to memorize, the latter provides a more principled model that captures dependencies across phrasal boundaries. Some work has been done to combine insights from these two frameworks. A recent successful attempt showed the advantage of using phrasebased search on top of an N-gram-based model. We probe this question in the reverse direction by investigating whether integrating N-gram-based translation and reordering models into a phrase-based decoder helps overcome the problematic phrasal independence assumption. A large scale evaluation over 8 language pairs shows that performance does significantly improve.</p><p>6 0.73964453 <a title="200-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Cut_the_noise%3A_Mutually_reinforcing_reordering_and_alignments_for_improved_machine_translation.html">101 acl-2013-Cut the noise: Mutually reinforcing reordering and alignments for improved machine translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Thomas Mayer ; Christian Rohrdantz</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes the online tool PhonMatrix, which analyzes a word list with respect to the co-occurrence of sounds in a specified context within a word. The cooccurrence counts from the user-specified context are statistically analyzed according to a number of association measures that can be selected by the user. The statistical values then serve as the input for a matrix visualization where rows and columns represent the relevant sounds under investigation and the matrix cells indicate whether the respective ordered pair of sounds occurs more or less frequently than expected. The usefulness of the tool is demonstrated with three case studies that deal with vowel harmony and similar place avoidance patterns.</p><p>3 0.71446967 <a title="200-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Using_subcategorization_knowledge_to_improve_case_prediction_for_translation_to_German.html">378 acl-2013-Using subcategorization knowledge to improve case prediction for translation to German</a></p>

We use token level labels to derive sentence-level features. These features are then used with other core and meta features to train a generative classifier that predicts the correct label for each sentence in the given input text. The system achieves an accuracy of 85.5% on an Arabic online-commentary dataset outperforming a previously proposed approach achieving 80.9% and reflecting a significant gain over a majority baseline of 5 1.9% and two strong baseline systems of 78.5% and 80.4%, respectively.</p><p>5 0.7044518 <a title="200-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Learning_a_Phrase-based_Translation_Model_from_Monolingual_Data_with_Application_to_Domain_Adaptation.html">223 acl-2013-Learning a Phrase-based Translation Model from Monolingual Data with Application to Domain Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiajun Zhang ; Chengqing Zong</p><p>Abstract: Currently, almost all of the statistical machine translation (SMT) models are trained with the parallel corpora in some specific domains. However, when it comes to a language pair or a different domain without any bilingual resources, the traditional SMT loses its power. Recently, some research works study the unsupervised SMT for inducing a simple word-based translation model from the monolingual corpora. It successfully bypasses the constraint of bitext for SMT and obtains a relatively promising result. In this paper, we take a step forward and propose a simple but effective method to induce a phrase-based model from the monolingual corpora given an automatically-induced translation lexicon or a manually-edited translation dictionary. We apply our method for the domain adaptation task and the extensive experiments show that our proposed method can substantially improve the translation quality. 1</p><p>6 0.70303386 <a title="200-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Advancements_in_Reordering_Models_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">40 acl-2013-Advancements in Reordering Models for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Annie Chen</p><p>Abstract: Though there has been substantial research concerning the extraction of information from clinical notes, to date there has been less work concerning the extraction of useful information from patient-generated content. Using a dataset comprised of online support group discussion content, this paper investigates two dimensions that may be important in the extraction of patient-generated experiences from text; significant individuals/groups and medication use. With regard to the former, the paper describes an approach involving the pairing of important figures (e.g. family, husbands, doctors, etc.) and affect, and suggests possible applications of such techniques to research concerning online social support, as well as integration into search interfaces for patients. Additionally, the paper demonstrates the extraction of side effects and sentiment at different phases in patient medication use, e.g. adoption, current use, discontinuation and switching, and demonstrates the utility of such an application for drug safety monitoring in online discussion forums. 1</p><p>4 0.049955387 <a title="277-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Co-regularizing_character-based_and_word-based_models_for_semi-supervised_Chinese_word_segmentation.html">82 acl-2013-Co-regularizing character-based and word-based models for semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaodong Zeng ; Derek F. Wong ; Lidia S. Chao ; Isabel Trancoso</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation (CWS) approach that co-regularizes character-based and word-based models. Similarly to multi-view learning, the “segmentation agreements” between the two different types of view are used to overcome the scarcity of the label information on unlabeled data. The proposed approach trains a character-based and word-based model on labeled data, respectively, as the initial models. Then, the two models are constantly updated using unlabeled examples, where the learning objective is maximizing their segmentation agreements. The agreements are regarded as a set of valuable constraints for regularizing the learning of both models on unlabeled data. The segmentation for an input sentence is decoded by using a joint scoring function combining the two induced models. The evaluation on the Chinese tree bank reveals that our model results in better gains over the state-of-the-art semi-supervised models reported in the literature.</p><p>5 0.043753337 <a title="277-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Mr._MIRA%3A_Open-Source_Large-Margin_Structured_Learning_on_MapReduce.html">251 acl-2013-Mr. MIRA: Open-Source Large-Margin Structured Learning on MapReduce</a></p>
<p>Author: Vladimir Eidelman ; Ke Wu ; Ferhan Ture ; Philip Resnik ; Jimmy Lin</p><p>Abstract: We present an open-source framework for large-scale online structured learning. Developed with the flexibility to handle cost-augmented inference problems such as statistical machine translation (SMT), our large-margin learner can be used with any decoder. Integration with MapReduce using Hadoop streaming allows efficient scaling with increasing size of training data. Although designed with a focus on SMT, the decoder-agnostic design of our learner allows easy future extension to other structured learning problems such as sequence labeling and parsing.</p><p>6 0.041798785 <a title="277-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Fast_and_Adaptive_Online_Training_of_Feature-Rich_Translation_Models.html">156 acl-2013-Fast and Adaptive Online Training of Feature-Rich Translation Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael Lucas ; Doug Downey</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods augment standard machine learning (ML) techniques to leverage unlabeled data. SSL techniques are often effective in text classification, where labeled data is scarce but large unlabeled corpora are readily available. However, existing SSL techniques typically require multiple passes over the entirety of the unlabeled data, meaning the techniques are not applicable to large corpora being produced today. In this paper, we show that improving marginal word frequency estimates using unlabeled data can enable semi-supervised text classification that scales to massive unlabeled data sets. We present a novel learning algorithm, which optimizes a Naive Bayes model to accord with statistics calculated from the unlabeled corpus. In experiments with text topic classification and sentiment analysis, we show that our method is both more scalable and more accurate than SSL techniques from previous work.</p><p>3 0.6887756 <a title="277-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Semi-Supervised_Semantic_Tagging_of_Conversational_Understanding_using_Markov_Topic_Regression.html">315 acl-2013-Semi-Supervised Semantic Tagging of Conversational Understanding using Markov Topic Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Asli Celikyilmaz ; Dilek Hakkani-Tur ; Gokhan Tur ; Ruhi Sarikaya</p><p>Abstract: Microsoft Research Microsoft Mountain View, CA, USA Redmond, WA, USA dilek @ ieee .org rus arika@mi cro s o ft . com gokhan .tur @ ieee .org performance (Tur and DeMori, 2011). This requires a tedious and time intensive data collection Finding concepts in natural language utterances is a challenging task, especially given the scarcity of labeled data for learning semantic ambiguity. Furthermore, data mismatch issues, which arise when the expected test (target) data does not exactly match the training data, aggravate this scarcity problem. To deal with these issues, we describe an efficient semisupervised learning (SSL) approach which has two components: (i) Markov Topic Regression is a new probabilistic model to cluster words into semantic tags (concepts). It can efficiently handle semantic ambiguity by extending standard topic models with two new features. First, it encodes word n-gram features from labeled source and unlabeled target data. Second, by going beyond a bag-of-words approach, it takes into account the inherent sequential nature of utterances to learn semantic classes based on context. (ii) Retrospective Learner is a new learning technique that adapts to the unlabeled target data. Our new SSL approach improves semantic tagging performance by 3% absolute over the baseline models, and also compares favorably on semi-supervised syntactic tagging.</p><p>4 0.65496433 <a title="277-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Improved_Bayesian_Logistic_Supervised_Topic_Models_with_Data_Augmentation.html">191 acl-2013-Improved Bayesian Logistic Supervised Topic Models with Data Augmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun Zhu ; Xun Zheng ; Bo Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Supervised topic models with a logistic likelihood have two issues that potentially limit their practical use: 1) response variables are usually over-weighted by document word counts; and 2) existing variational inference methods make strict mean-field assumptions. We address these issues by: 1) introducing a regularization constant to better balance the two parts based on an optimization formulation of Bayesian inference; and 2) developing a simple Gibbs sampling algorithm by introducing auxiliary Polya-Gamma variables and collapsing out Dirichlet variables. Our augment-and-collapse sampling algorithm has analytical forms of each conditional distribution without making any restricting assumptions and can be easily parallelized. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements on prediction performance and time efficiency.</p><p>5 0.64160293 <a title="277-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Text_Classification_from_Positive_and_Unlabeled_Data_using_Misclassified_Data_Correction.html">342 acl-2013-Text Classification from Positive and Unlabeled Data using Misclassified Data Correction</a></p>

<p>Author: Katsuma Narisawa ; Yotaro Watanabe ; Junta Mizuno ; Naoaki Okazaki ; Kentaro Inui</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents novel methods for modeling numerical common sense: the ability to infer whether a given number (e.g., three billion) is large, small, or normal for a given context (e.g., number of people facing a water shortage). We first discuss the necessity of numerical common sense in solving textual entailment problems. We explore two approaches for acquiring numerical common sense. Both approaches start with extracting numerical expressions and their context from the Web. One approach estimates the distribution ofnumbers co-occurring within a context and examines whether a given value is large, small, or normal, based on the distri- bution. Another approach utilizes textual patterns with which speakers explicitly expresses their judgment about the value of a numerical expression. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.75163603 <a title="277-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Part-of-speech_tagging_with_antagonistic_adversaries.html">277 acl-2013-Part-of-speech tagging with antagonistic adversaries</a></p>

<p>Author: Fangtao Li ; Yang Gao ; Shuchang Zhou ; Xiance Si ; Decheng Dai</p><p>Abstract: In Community question answering (QA) sites, malicious users may provide deceptive answers to promote their products or services. It is important to identify and filter out these deceptive answers. In this paper, we first solve this problem with the traditional supervised learning methods. Two kinds of features, including textual and contextual features, are investigated for this task. We further propose to exploit the user relationships to identify the deceptive answers, based on the hypothesis that similar users will have similar behaviors to post deceptive or authentic answers. To measure the user similarity, we propose a new user preference graph based on the answer preference expressed by users, such as “helpful” voting and “best answer” selection. The user preference graph is incorporated into traditional supervised learning framework with the graph regularization technique. The experiment results demonstrate that the user preference graph can indeed help improve the performance of deceptive answer prediction.</p><p>4 0.67245936 <a title="277-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-An_improved_MDL-based_compression_algorithm_for_unsupervised_word_segmentation.html">50 acl-2013-An improved MDL-based compression algorithm for unsupervised word segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ruey-Cheng Chen</p><p>Abstract: We study the mathematical properties of a recently proposed MDL-based unsupervised word segmentation algorithm, called regularized compression. Our analysis shows that its objective function can be efficiently approximated using the negative empirical pointwise mutual information. The proposed extension improves the baseline performance in both efficiency and accuracy on a standard benchmark.</p><p>5 0.67173821 <a title="277-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Language-Independent_Discriminative_Parsing_of_Temporal_Expressions.html">212 acl-2013-Language-Independent Discriminative Parsing of Temporal Expressions</a></p>
<p>Author: Gabor Angeli ; Jakob Uszkoreit</p><p>Abstract: Temporal resolution systems are traditionally tuned to a particular language, requiring significant human effort to translate them to new languages. We present a language independent semantic parser for learning the interpretation of temporal phrases given only a corpus of utterances and the times they reference. We make use of a latent parse that encodes a language-flexible representation of time, and extract rich features over both the parse and associated temporal semantics. The parameters of the model are learned using a weakly supervised bootstrapping approach, without the need for manually tuned parameters or any other language expertise. We achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on all languages in the TempEval2 temporal normalization task, reporting a 4% improvement in both English and Spanish accuracy, and to our knowledge the first results for four other languages.</p><p>6 0.67158425 <a title="277-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-A_Shift-Reduce_Parsing_Algorithm_for_Phrase-based_String-to-Dependency_Translation.html">19 acl-2013-A Shift-Reduce Parsing Algorithm for Phrase-based String-to-Dependency Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Ravi Kondadadi ; Blake Howald ; Frank Schilder</p><p>Abstract: We present a hybrid natural language generation (NLG) system that consolidates macro and micro planning and surface realization tasks into one statistical learning process. Our novel approach is based on deriving a template bank automatically from a corpus of texts from a target domain. First, we identify domain specific entity tags and Discourse Representation Structures on a per sentence basis. Each sentence is then organized into semantically similar groups (representing a domain specific concept) by k-means clustering. After this semi-automatic processing (human review of cluster assignments), a number of corpus–level statistics are compiled and used as features by a ranking SVM to develop model weights from a training corpus. At generation time, a set of input data, the collection of semantically organized templates, and the model weights are used to select optimal templates. Our system is evaluated with automatic, non–expert crowdsourced and expert evaluation metrics. We also introduce a novel automatic metric syntactic variability that represents linguistic variation as a measure of unique template sequences across a collection of automatically generated documents. The metrics for generated weather and biography texts fall within acceptable ranges. In sum, we argue that our statistical approach to NLG reduces the need for complicated knowledge-based architectures and readily adapts to different domains with reduced development time. – – *∗Ravi Kondadadi is now affiliated with Nuance Communications, Inc.</p><p>3 0.090762682 <a title="337-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Combining_Referring_Expression_Generation_and_Surface_Realization%3A_A_Corpus-Based_Investigation_of_Architectures.html">86 acl-2013-Combining Referring Expression Generation and Surface Realization: A Corpus-Based Investigation of Architectures</a></p>

<p>Author: Nina Dethlefs ; Helen Hastie ; Heriberto Cuayahuitl ; Oliver Lemon</p><p>Abstract: Surface realisers in spoken dialogue systems need to be more responsive than conventional surface realisers. They need to be sensitive to the utterance context as well as robust to partial or changing generator inputs. We formulate surface realisation as a sequence labelling task and combine the use of conditional random fields (CRFs) with semantic trees. Due to their extended notion of context, CRFs are able to take the global utterance context into account and are less constrained by local features than other realisers. This leads to more natural and less repetitive surface realisation. It also allows generation from partial and modified inputs and is therefore applicable to incremental surface realisation. Results from a human rating study confirm that users are sensitive to this extended notion of context and assign ratings that are significantly higher (up to 14%) than those for taking only local context into account.</p><p>6 0.061929386 <a title="337-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Language-Independent_Discriminative_Parsing_of_Temporal_Expressions.html">212 acl-2013-Language-Independent Discriminative Parsing of Temporal Expressions</a></p>

<p>Author: Arturo Curiel ; Christophe Collet</p><p>Abstract: . This paper explores the use of Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL) as a suitable formal framework for describing Sign Language (SL) , the language of deaf people, in the context of natural language processing. SLs are visual, complete, standalone languages which are just as expressive as oral languages. Signs in SL usually correspond to sequences of highly specific body postures interleaved with movements, which make reference to real world objects, characters or situations. Here we propose a formal representation of SL signs, that will help us with the analysis of automatically-collected hand tracking data from French Sign Language (FSL) video corpora. We further show how such a representation could help us with the design of computer aided SL verification tools, which in turn would bring us closer to the development of an automatic recognition system for these languages.</p><p>4 0.61610186 <a title="337-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Extracting_Events_with_Informal_Temporal_References_in_Personal_Histories_in_Online_Communities.html">153 acl-2013-Extracting Events with Informal Temporal References in Personal Histories in Online Communities</a></p>
<p>Author: Miaomiao Wen ; Zeyu Zheng ; Hyeju Jang ; Guang Xiang ; Carolyn Penstein Rose</p><p>Abstract: We present a system for extracting the dates of illness events (year and month of the event occurrence) from posting histories in the context of an online medical support community. A temporal tagger retrieves and normalizes dates mentioned informally in social media to actual month and year referents. Building on this, an event date extraction system learns to integrate the likelihood of candidate dates extracted from time-rich sentences with temporal constraints extracted from eventrelated sentences. Our integrated model achieves 89.7% of the maximum performance given the performance of the temporal expression retrieval step.</p><p>5 0.61114097 <a title="337-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Identification_of_Speakers_in_Novels.html">184 acl-2013-Identification of Speakers in Novels</a></p>

It is challenging to auto- mate because the speakers of the majority ofutterances are not explicitly identified in novels. In this paper, we present a supervised machine learning approach for the task that incorporates several novel features. The experimental results show that our method is more accurate and general than previous approaches to the problem.</p><p>6 0.60615414 <a title="337-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Implicatures_and_Nested_Beliefs_in_Approximate_Decentralized-POMDPs.html">190 acl-2013-Implicatures and Nested Beliefs in Approximate Decentralized-POMDPs</a></p>

<p>Author: Shay B. Cohen ; Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic context-free grammars have the unusual property of not always defining tight distributions (i.e., the sum of the “probabilities” of the trees the grammar generates can be less than one). This paper reviews how this non-tightness can arise and discusses its impact on Bayesian estimation of PCFGs. We begin by presenting the notion of “almost everywhere tight grammars” and show that linear CFGs follow it. We then propose three different ways of reinterpreting non-tight PCFGs to make them tight, show that the Bayesian estimators in Johnson et al. (2007) are correct under one of them, and provide MCMC samplers for the other two. We conclude with a discussion of the impact of tightness empirically.</p><p>3 0.56443423 <a title="337-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Automated_Pyramid_Scoring_of_Summaries_using_Distributional_Semantics.html">59 acl-2013-Automated Pyramid Scoring of Summaries using Distributional Semantics</a></p>

<p>Author: Keisuke Sakaguchi ; Yuki Arase ; Mamoru Komachi</p><p>Abstract: We propose discriminative methods to generate semantic distractors of fill-in-theblank quiz for language learners using a large-scale language learners’ corpus. Unlike previous studies, the proposed methods aim at satisfying both reliability and validity of generated distractors; distractors should be exclusive against answers to avoid multiple answers in one quiz, and distractors should discriminate learners’ proficiency. Detailed user evaluation with 3 native and 23 non-native speakers of English shows that our methods achieve better reliability and validity than previous methods.</p><p>5 0.54594135 <a title="337-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Two-Neighbor_Orientation_Model_with_Cross-Boundary_Global_Contexts.html">363 acl-2013-Two-Neighbor Orientation Model with Cross-Boundary Global Contexts</a></p>
<p>Author: Hendra Setiawan ; Bowen Zhou ; Bing Xiang ; Libin Shen</p><p>Abstract: Long distance reordering remains one of the greatest challenges in statistical machine translation research as the key contextual information may well be beyond the confine of translation units. In this paper, we propose Two-Neighbor Orientation (TNO) model that jointly models the orientation decisions between anchors and two neighboring multi-unit chunks which may cross phrase or rule boundaries. We explicitly model the longest span of such chunks, referred to as Maximal Orientation Span, to serve as a global parameter that constrains underlying local decisions. We integrate our proposed model into a state-of-the-art string-to-dependency translation system and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposal in a large-scale Chinese-to-English translation task. On NIST MT08 set, our most advanced model brings around +2.0 BLEU and -1.0 TER improvement.</p><p>6 0.54541111 <a title="337-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-FudanNLP%3A_A_Toolkit_for_Chinese_Natural_Language_Processing.html">164 acl-2013-FudanNLP: A Toolkit for Chinese Natural Language Processing</a></p>

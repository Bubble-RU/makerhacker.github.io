<p>Author: Ji Ma ; Jingbo Zhu ; Tong Xiao ; Nan Yang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we combine easy-first dependency parsing and POS tagging algorithms with beam search and structured perceptron. We propose a simple variant of “early-update” to ensure valid update in the training process. The proposed solution can also be applied to combine beam search and structured perceptron with other systems that exhibit spurious ambiguity. On CTB, we achieve 94.01% tagging accuracy and 86.33% unlabeled attachment score with a relatively small beam width. On PTB, we also achieve state-of-the-art performance. 1</p><p>3 0.38233536 <a title="358-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-A_Transition-Based_Dependency_Parser_Using_a_Dynamic_Parsing_Strategy.html">26 acl-2013-A Transition-Based Dependency Parser Using a Dynamic Parsing Strategy</a></p>

We demonstrate that, contrary to popular belief, most current implementations of beam parsers in fact run in O(n2), rather than linear time, because each statetransition is actually implemented as an O(n) operation. We present an improved implementation, based on Tree Structured Stack (TSS), in which a transition is performed in O(1), resulting in a real lineartime algorithm, which is verified empiri- cally. We further improve parsing speed by sharing feature-extraction and dotproduct across beam items.

<p>Author: Muhua Zhu ; Yue Zhang ; Wenliang Chen ; Min Zhang ; Jingbo Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Shift-reduce dependency parsers give comparable accuracies to their chartbased counterparts, yet the best shiftreduce constituent parsers still lag behind the state-of-the-art. One important reason is the existence of unary nodes in phrase structure trees, which leads to different numbers of shift-reduce actions between different outputs for the same input. This turns out to have a large empirical impact on the framework of global training and beam search. We propose a simple yet effective extension to the shift-reduce process, which eliminates size differences between action sequences in beam-search. Our parser gives comparable accuracies to the state-of-the-art chart parsers. With linear run-time complexity, our parser is over an order of magnitude faster than the fastest chart parser.</p><p>6 0.22043212 <a title="358-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-The_Effect_of_Higher-Order_Dependency_Features_in_Discriminative_Phrase-Structure_Parsing.html">343 acl-2013-The Effect of Higher-Order Dependency Features in Discriminative Phrase-Structure Parsing</a></p>

We carry out an experimental comparison of (a) three syntactic dependency schemes; (b) three data-driven dependency parsers; and (c) the influence of two different approaches to lexical category disambiguation (aka tagging) prior to parsing. Comparing parsing accuracies in various setups, we study the interactions of these three aspects and analyze which configurations are easier to learn for a dependency parser.</p><p>6 0.75212878 <a title="358-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Fast_and_Accurate_Shift-Reduce_Constituent_Parsing.html">155 acl-2013-Fast and Accurate Shift-Reduce Constituent Parsing</a></p>

By moderately leveraging the dependency information projected from the parsed counterpart language, and simultaneously mining the underlying syntactic structure of the language considered, it effectively integrates the advantages of bilingual projection and unsupervised induction, so as to induce a monolingual grammar much better than previous models only using bilingual projection or unsupervised induction. We induced dependency gram- mar for five different languages under the guidance of dependency information projected from the parsed English translation, experiments show that the bilinguallyguided method achieves a significant improvement of 28.5% over the unsupervised baseline and 3.0% over the best projection baseline on average.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.84455216 <a title="358-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Transition-based_Dependency_Parsing_with_Selectional_Branching.html">358 acl-2013-Transition-based Dependency Parsing with Selectional Branching</a></p>

<p>Author: Hajime Morita ; Ryohei Sasano ; Hiroya Takamura ; Manabu Okumura</p><p>Abstract: This study proposes a text summarization model that simultaneously performs sentence extraction and compression. We translate the text summarization task into a problem of extracting a set of dependency subtrees in the document cluster. We also encode obligatory case constraints as must-link dependency constraints in order to guarantee the readability of the generated summary. In order to handle the subtree extraction problem, we investigate a new class of submodular maximization problem, and a new algorithm that has the approximation ratio 21 (1 − e−1). Our experiments with the NTC(1IR − −A eCLIA test collections show that our approach outperforms a state-of-the-art algorithm.</p><p>5 0.83464617 <a title="358-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Iterative_Transformation_of_Annotation_Guidelines_for_Constituency_Parsing.html">204 acl-2013-Iterative Transformation of Annotation Guidelines for Constituency Parsing</a></p>

Some of these data are in the form of free text and require preprocessing to be able to used in automated systems. Efficient and effective use of this data could be vital to the speed and quality of health care. As a case study, we analyzed classification of CT imaging reports into binary categories. In addition to regular text classification, we utilized topic modeling of the entire dataset in various ways. Topic modeling of the corpora provides interpretable themes that exist in these reports. Representing reports according to their topic distributions is more compact than bag-of-words representation and can be processed faster than raw text in subsequent automated processes. A binary topic model was also built as an unsupervised classification approach with the assumption that each topic corresponds to a class. And, finally an aggregate topic classifier was built where reports are classified based on a single discriminative topic that is determined from the training dataset. Our proposed topic based classifier system is shown to be competitive with existing text classification techniques and provides a more efficient and interpretable representation.</p><p>3 0.15609032 <a title="52-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Collective_Annotation_of_Linguistic_Resources%3A_Basic_Principles_and_a_Formal_Model.html">83 acl-2013-Collective Annotation of Linguistic Resources: Basic Principles and a Formal Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Trevor Cohn ; Lucia Specia</p><p>Abstract: Annotating linguistic data is often a complex, time consuming and expensive endeavour. Even with strict annotation guidelines, human subjects often deviate in their analyses, each bringing different biases, interpretations of the task and levels of consistency. We present novel techniques for learning from the outputs of multiple annotators while accounting for annotator specific behaviour. These techniques use multi-task Gaussian Processes to learn jointly a series of annotator and metadata specific models, while explicitly representing correlations between models which can be learned directly from data. Our experiments on two machine translation quality estimation datasets show uniform significant accuracy gains from multi-task learning, and consistently outperform strong baselines.</p><p>5 0.1226061 <a title="52-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Real-World_Semi-Supervised_Learning_of_POS-Taggers_for_Low-Resource_Languages.html">295 acl-2013-Real-World Semi-Supervised Learning of POS-Taggers for Low-Resource Languages</a></p>
<p>Author: Dan Garrette ; Jason Mielens ; Jason Baldridge</p><p>Abstract: Developing natural language processing tools for low-resource languages often requires creating resources from scratch. While a variety of semi-supervised methods exist for training from incomplete data, there are open questions regarding what types of training data should be used and how much is necessary. We discuss a series of experiments designed to shed light on such questions in the context of part-of-speech tagging. We obtain timed annotations from linguists for the low-resource languages Kinyarwanda and Malagasy (as well as English) and eval- uate how the amounts of various kinds of data affect performance of a trained POS-tagger. Our results show that annotation of word types is the most important, provided a sufficiently capable semi-supervised learning infrastructure is in place to project type information onto a raw corpus. We also show that finitestate morphological analyzers are effective sources of type information when few labeled examples are available.</p><p>6 0.10939559 <a title="52-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Reducing_Annotation_Effort_for_Quality_Estimation_via_Active_Learning.html">300 acl-2013-Reducing Annotation Effort for Quality Estimation via Active Learning</a></p>

WebAnno offers annotation project management, freely configurable tagsets and the management of users in different roles. WebAnno uses modern web technology for visualizing and editing annotations in a web browser. It supports arbitrarily large documents, pluggable import/export filters, the curation of annotations across various users, and an interface to farming out annotations to a crowdsourcing platform. Currently WebAnno allows part-ofspeech, named entity, dependency parsing and co-reference chain annotations. The architecture design allows adding additional modes of visualization and editing, when new kinds of annotations are to be supported.</p><p>3 0.82489365 <a title="52-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Real-World_Semi-Supervised_Learning_of_POS-Taggers_for_Low-Resource_Languages.html">295 acl-2013-Real-World Semi-Supervised Learning of POS-Taggers for Low-Resource Languages</a></p>

<p>Author: Valentin Tablan ; Kalina Bontcheva ; Ian Roberts ; Hamish Cunningham ; Marin Dimitrov</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents AnnoMarket, an open cloud-based platform which enables researchers to deploy, share, and use language processing components and resources, following the data-as-a-service and software-as-a-service paradigms. The focus is on multilingual text analysis resources and services, based on an opensource infrastructure and compliant with relevant NLP standards. We demonstrate how the AnnoMarket platform can be used to develop NLP applications with little or no programming, to index the results for enhanced browsing and search, and to evaluate performance. Utilising AnnoMarket is straightforward, since cloud infrastructural issues are dealt with by the platform, completely transparently to the user: load balancing, efficient data upload and storage, deployment on the virtual machines, security, and fault tolerance.</p><p>6 0.71496326 <a title="52-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Universal_Conceptual_Cognitive_Annotation_%28UCCA%29.html">367 acl-2013-Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation (UCCA)</a></p>

By moderately leveraging the dependency information projected from the parsed counterpart language, and simultaneously mining the underlying syntactic structure of the language considered, it effectively integrates the advantages of bilingual projection and unsupervised induction, so as to induce a monolingual grammar much better than previous models only using bilingual projection or unsupervised induction. We induced dependency gram- mar for five different languages under the guidance of dependency information projected from the parsed English translation, experiments show that the bilinguallyguided method achieves a significant improvement of 28.5% over the unsupervised baseline and 3.0% over the best projection baseline on average.</p><p>3 0.91168505 <a title="52-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Iterative_Transformation_of_Annotation_Guidelines_for_Constituency_Parsing.html">204 acl-2013-Iterative Transformation of Annotation Guidelines for Constituency Parsing</a></p>

The idea is to use language models trained on small in-domain text to select similar sentences from large general-domain corpora, which are then incorporated into the training data. Substantial gains have been demonstrated in previous works, which employ standard ngram language models. Here, we explore the use of neural language models for data selection. We hypothesize that the continuous vector representation of words in neural language models makes them more effective than n-grams for modeling un- known word contexts, which are prevalent in general-domain text. In a comprehensive evaluation of 4 language pairs (English to German, French, Russian, Spanish), we found that neural language models are indeed viable tools for data selection: while the improvements are varied (i.e. 0.1 to 1.7 gains in BLEU), they are fast to train on small in-domain data and can sometimes substantially outperform conventional n-grams.</p><p>5 0.89141655 <a title="52-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Subtree_Extractive_Summarization_via_Submodular_Maximization.html">332 acl-2013-Subtree Extractive Summarization via Submodular Maximization</a></p>
<p>Author: Hajime Morita ; Ryohei Sasano ; Hiroya Takamura ; Manabu Okumura</p><p>Abstract: This study proposes a text summarization model that simultaneously performs sentence extraction and compression. We translate the text summarization task into a problem of extracting a set of dependency subtrees in the document cluster. We also encode obligatory case constraints as must-link dependency constraints in order to guarantee the readability of the generated summary. In order to handle the subtree extraction problem, we investigate a new class of submodular maximization problem, and a new algorithm that has the approximation ratio 21 (1 − e−1). Our experiments with the NTC(1IR − −A eCLIA test collections show that our approach outperforms a state-of-the-art algorithm.</p><p>6 0.89034736 <a title="52-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Recognizing_Partial_Textual_Entailment.html">297 acl-2013-Recognizing Partial Textual Entailment</a></p>

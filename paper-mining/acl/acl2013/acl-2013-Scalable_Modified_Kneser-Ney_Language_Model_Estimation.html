<p>Author: Brian Roark ; Cyril Allauzen ; Michael Riley</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm for re-estimating parameters of backoff n-gram language models so as to preserve given marginal distributions, along the lines of wellknown Kneser-Ney (1995) smoothing. Unlike Kneser-Ney, our approach is designed to be applied to any given smoothed backoff model, including models that have already been heavily pruned. As a result, the algorithm avoids issues observed when pruning Kneser-Ney models (Siivola et al., 2007; Chelba et al., 2010), while retaining the benefits of such marginal distribution constraints. We present experimental results for heavily pruned backoff ngram models, and demonstrate perplexity and word error rate reductions when used with various baseline smoothing methods. An open-source version of the algorithm has been released as part of the OpenGrm ngram library.1</p><p>3 0.1191827 <a title="308-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Combination_of_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_and_Factored_Language_Models_for_Code-Switching_Language_Modeling.html">84 acl-2013-Combination of Recurrent Neural Networks and Factored Language Models for Code-Switching Language Modeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Heike Adel ; Ngoc Thang Vu ; Tanja Schultz</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the application of recurrent neural network language models (RNNLM) and factored language models (FLM) to the task of language modeling for Code-Switching speech. We present a way to integrate partof-speech tags (POS) and language information (LID) into these models which leads to significant improvements in terms of perplexity.

The final combined language model provides 37.8% relative improvement in terms of perplexity on the SEAME development set and a relative improvement of 32.7% on the evaluation set compared to the traditional n-gram language model.

<p>Author: Wenduan Xu ; Yue Zhang ; Philip Williams ; Philipp Koehn</p><p>Abstract: We present a context-sensitive chart pruning method for CKY-style MT decoding. Source phrases that are unlikely to have aligned target constituents are identified using sequence labellers learned from the parallel corpus, and speed-up is obtained by pruning corresponding chart cells. The proposed method is easy to implement, orthogonal to cube pruning and additive to its pruning power. On a full-scale Englishto-German experiment with a string-totree model, we obtain a speed-up of more than 60% over a strong baseline, with no loss in BLEU.</p><p>5 0.094082966 <a title="308-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Mr._MIRA%3A_Open-Source_Large-Margin_Structured_Learning_on_MapReduce.html">251 acl-2013-Mr. MIRA: Open-Source Large-Margin Structured Learning on MapReduce</a></p>
<p>Author: Vladimir Eidelman ; Ke Wu ; Ferhan Ture ; Philip Resnik ; Jimmy Lin</p><p>Abstract: We present an open-source framework for large-scale online structured learning. Developed with the flexibility to handle cost-augmented inference problems such as statistical machine translation (SMT), our large-margin learner can be used with any decoder. Integration with MapReduce using Hadoop streaming allows efficient scaling with increasing size of training data. Although designed with a focus on SMT, the decoder-agnostic design of our learner allows easy future extension to other structured learning problems such as sequence labeling and parsing.</p><p>6 0.089897752 <a title="308-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Scalable_Decipherment_for_Machine_Translation_via_Hash_Sampling.html">307 acl-2013-Scalable Decipherment for Machine Translation via Hash Sampling</a></p>

<p>Author: Tze Yuang Chong ; Rafael E.

We attempt to extract this information from history-contexts of up to ten words in size, and found it complements well the n-gram model, which inherently suffers from data scarcity in learning long history-contexts. Evaluated on the WSJ corpus, bigram and trigram model perplexity were reduced up to 23.5% and 14.0%, respectively. Compared to the distant bigram, we show that word-pairs can be more effectively modeled in terms of both distance and occurrence. 1</p><p>4 0.70053989 <a title="308-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Combination_of_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_and_Factored_Language_Models_for_Code-Switching_Language_Modeling.html">84 acl-2013-Combination of Recurrent Neural Networks and Factored Language Models for Code-Switching Language Modeling</a></p>

<p>Author: David Kauchak</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we examine language modeling for text simplification. Unlike some text-to-text translation tasks, text simplification is a monolingual translation task allowing for text in both the input and output domain to be used for training the language model. We explore the relationship between normal English and simplified English and compare language models trained on varying amounts of text from each. We evaluate the models intrinsically with perplexity and extrinsically on the lexical simplification task from SemEval 2012. We find that a combined model using both simplified and normal English data achieves a 23% improvement in perplexity and a 24% improvement on the lexical simplification task over a model trained only on simple data. Post-hoc analysis shows that the additional unsimplified data provides better coverage for unseen and rare n-grams.</p><p>6 0.52791446 <a title="308-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Adaptation_Data_Selection_using_Neural_Language_Models%3A_Experiments_in_Machine_Translation.html">35 acl-2013-Adaptation Data Selection using Neural Language Models: Experiments in Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhongyu Wei ; Junwen Chen ; Wei Gao ; Binyang Li ; Lanjun Zhou ; Yulan He ; Kam-Fai Wong</p><p>Abstract: Uncertainty text detection is important to many social-media-based applications since more and more users utilize social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, etc.) as information source to produce or derive interpretations based on them. However, existing uncertainty cues are ineffective in social media context because of its specific characteristics. In this paper, we propose a variant of annotation scheme for uncertainty identification and construct the first uncertainty corpus based on tweets. We then conduct experiments on the generated tweets corpus to study the effectiveness of different types of features for uncertainty text identification.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.72705412 <a title="308-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Scalable_Modified_Kneser-Ney_Language_Model_Estimation.html">308 acl-2013-Scalable Modified Kneser-Ney Language Model Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Hoifung Poon</p><p>Abstract: We present the first unsupervised approach for semantic parsing that rivals the accuracy of supervised approaches in translating natural-language questions to database queries. Our GUSP system produces a semantic parse by annotating the dependency-tree nodes and edges with latent states, and learns a probabilistic grammar using EM. To compensate for the lack of example annotations or question-answer pairs, GUSP adopts a novel grounded-learning approach to leverage database for indirect supervision. On the challenging ATIS dataset, GUSP attained an accuracy of 84%, effectively tying with the best published results by supervised approaches.</p><p>4 0.65419686 <a title="308-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Combination_of_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_and_Factored_Language_Models_for_Code-Switching_Language_Modeling.html">84 acl-2013-Combination of Recurrent Neural Networks and Factored Language Models for Code-Switching Language Modeling</a></p>

Furthermore, a comparison between RNNLMs and FLMs and a detailed analysis of perplexities on the different backoff levels are performed. Finally, we show that recurrent neural networks and factored language models can . be combined using linear interpolation to achieve the best performance. The final combined language model provides 37.8% relative improvement in terms of perplexity on the SEAME development set and a relative improvement of 32.7% on the evaluation set compared to the traditional n-gram language model. Index Terms: multilingual speech processing, code switching, language modeling, recurrent neural networks, factored language models</p><p>5 0.63080531 <a title="308-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Probabilistic_Sense_Sentiment_Similarity_through_Hidden_Emotions.html">284 acl-2013-Probabilistic Sense Sentiment Similarity through Hidden Emotions</a></p>
<p>Author: Mitra Mohtarami ; Man Lan ; Chew Lim Tan</p><p>Abstract: Sentiment Similarity of word pairs reflects the distance between the words regarding their underlying sentiments. This paper aims to infer the sentiment similarity between word pairs with respect to their senses. To achieve this aim, we propose a probabilistic emotionbased approach that is built on a hidden emotional model. The model aims to predict a vector of basic human emotions for each sense of the words. The resultant emotional vectors are then employed to infer the sentiment similarity of word pairs. We apply the proposed approach to address two main NLP tasks, namely, Indirect yes/no Question Answer Pairs inference and Sentiment Orientation prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p><p>6 0.61422658 <a title="308-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Name-aware_Machine_Translation.html">255 acl-2013-Name-aware Machine Translation</a></p>

Additionally, we also propose a new MT metric to appropriately evaluate the translation quality of informative words, by assigning different weights to different words according to their importance values in a document.

<p>Author: Spence Green ; Sida Wang ; Daniel Cer ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: We present a fast and scalable online method for tuning statistical machine translation models with large feature sets. The standard tuning algorithm—MERT—only scales to tens of features. Recent discriminative algorithms that accommodate sparse features have produced smaller than expected translation quality gains in large systems. Our method, which is based on stochastic gradient descent with an adaptive learning rate, scales to millions of features and tuning sets with tens of thousands of sentences, while still converging after only a few epochs. Large-scale experiments on Arabic-English and Chinese-English show that our method produces significant translation quality gains by exploiting sparse features. Equally important is our analysis, which suggests techniques for mitigating overfitting and domain mismatch, and applies to other recent discriminative methods for machine translation. 1</p><p>6 0.1526373 <a title="195-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-A_New_Syntactic_Metric_for_Evaluation_of_Machine_Translation.html">13 acl-2013-A New Syntactic Metric for Evaluation of Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Preslav Nakov ; Francisco Guzman ; Stephan Vogel</p><p>Abstract: While experimenting with tuning on long sentences, we made an unexpected discovery: that PRO falls victim to monsters overly long negative examples with very low BLEU+1 scores, which are unsuitable for learning and can cause testing BLEU to drop by several points absolute. We propose several effective ways to address the problem, using length- and BLEU+1based cut-offs, outlier filters, stochastic sampling, and random acceptance. The best of these fixes not only slay and protect against monsters, but also yield higher stability for PRO as well as improved testtime BLEU scores. Thus, we recommend them to anybody using PRO, monsterbeliever or not. – 1 Once Upon a Time... For years, the standard way to do statistical machine translation parameter tuning has been to use minimum error-rate training, or MERT (Och, 2003). However, as researchers started using models with thousands of parameters, new scalable optimization algorithms such as MIRA (Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2008) and PRO (Hopkins and May, 2011) have emerged. As these algorithms are relatively new, they are still not quite well understood, and studying their properties is an active area of research. For example, Nakov et al. (2012) have pointed out that PRO tends to generate translations that are consistently shorter than desired. They have blamed this on inadequate smoothing in PRO’s optimization objective, namely sentencelevel BLEU+1, and they have addressed the problem using more sensible smoothing. We wondered whether the issue could be partially relieved simply by tuning on longer sentences, for which the effect of smoothing would naturally be smaller. To our surprise, tuning on the longer 50% of the tuning sentences had a disastrous effect on PRO, causing an absolute drop of three BLEU points on testing; at the same time, MERT and MIRA did not have such a problem. While investigating the reasons, we discovered hundreds of monsters creeping under PRO’s surface... Our tale continues as follows. We first explain what monsters are in Section 2, then we present a theory about how they can be slayed in Section 3, we put this theory to test in practice in Section 4, and we discuss some related efforts in Section 5. Finally, we present the moral of our tale, and we hint at some planned future battles in Section 6. 2 Monsters, Inc. PRO uses pairwise ranking optimization, where the learning task is to classify pairs of hypotheses into correctly or incorrectly ordered (Hopkins and May, 2011). It searches for a vector of weights w such that higher evaluation metric scores correspond to higher model scores and vice versa. More formally, PRO looks for weights w such that g(i, j) > g(i, j0) ⇔ hw (i, j) > hw (i, j0), where g is a local scoring fu hnction (typically, sentencelevel BLEU+1) and hw are the model scores for a given input sentence i and two candidate hypotheses j and j0 that were obtained using w. If g(i, j) > g(i, j0), we will refer to j and j0 as the positive and the negative example in the pair. Learning good parameter values requires negative examples that are comparable to the positive ones. Instead, tuning on long sentences quickly introduces monsters, i.e., corrupted negative examples that are unsuitable for learning: they are (i) much longer than the respective positive examples and the references, and (ii) have very low BLEU+1 scores compared to the positive examples and in absolute terms. The low BLEU+1 means that PRO effectively has to learn from positive examples only. 12 Proce dinSgosfi oa,f tB huel 5g1arsita, An Anu gauls Mt 4e-e9ti n2g01 o3f. th ?c e2 A0s1s3oc Aiastsio cnia fotiron C fo mrp Cuotmatpiounta tlio Lninaglu Li sntgicusi,s ptaicgses 12–17, Avg.

Table 1shows an optimization run of PRO when tuning on long sentences. We can see monsters after iterations in which positive examples are on average longer than negative ones (e.g., iter. 1). As a result, PRO learns to generate longer sentences, but it overshoots too much (iter. 2), which gives rise to monsters. Ideally, the learning algorithm should be able to recover from overshooting. However, once monsters are encountered, they quickly start dominating, with no chance for PRO to recover since it accumulates n-best lists, and thus also monsters, over iterations. As a result, PRO keeps jumping up and down and converges to random values, as Figure 1 shows. By default, PRO’s parameters are averaged over iterations, and thus the final result is quite mediocre, but selecting the highest tuning score does not solve the problem either: for example, on Figure 1, PRO never achieves a BLEU better than that for the default initialization parameters. iteration Figure 1: PRO tuning results on long sentences across iterations. The dark-gray line shows the tuning BLEU (left axis), the light-gray one is the hypothesis/reference length ratio (right axis). Figure 2 shows the translations after iterations 1, 3 and 4; the last two are monsters. The monster at iteration 3 is potentially useful, but that at iteration 4 is clearly unsuitable as a negative example.

We also checked whether other popular optimizers yield very low BLEU scores at test time when tuned on long sentences. Lines 2-3 in Table 2 show that this is not the case for MERT and MIRA. Since they optimize objectives that are different from PRO’s,1 we further experimented with plugging MIRA’s objective into PRO and PRO’s objective into MIRA. The resulting MIRA scores were not much different from before, while PRO’s score dropped even further; we also found mon- sters. Next, we applied the length fix for PRO proposed in (Nakov et al., 2012); this helped a bit, but still left PRO two BLEU points behind and MIRA, and the monsters did not go away. We can conclude that the monster problem is PRO-specific, cannot be blamed on the objective function, and is different from the length bias. Note also that monsters are not specific to a dataset or language pair. We found them when tuning on the top-50% of WMT10 and testing on WMT1 1 for Spanish-English; this yielded a drop in BLEU from 29.63 (1M2/emEs/RprTes)la to 27.12 n(inPg/RtmOp.)1.1 MERT2 **REF** : but we have to close ranks with each other and realize that in unity there is strength while in division there is weakness . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - **IT1** : but we are that we add our ranks to some of us and that we know that in the strength and weakness in **IT3** : , we are the but of the that that the , and , of ranks the the on the the our the our the some of we can include , and , of to the of we know the the our in of the of some people , force of the that that the in of the that that the the weakness Union the the , and **IT4** : namely Dr Heba Handossah and Dr Mona been pushed aside because a larger story EU Ambassador to Egypt Ian Burg highlighted 've dragged us backwards and dragged our speaking , never balme your defaulting a December 7th 1941 in Pearl Harbor ) we can include ranks will be joined by all 've dragged us backwards and dragged our $ 3 .8 billion in tourism income proceeds Chamber are divided among themselves : some ' ve dragged us backwards and dragged our were exaggerated .

Then, we propose various monster slaying techniques to be applied during PRO’s selection and acceptance steps. 3.1 What is PRO? PRO is a batch optimizer that iterates between (i) translation: using the current parameter values, generate k-best translations, and (ii) optimization: using the translations from all previous iterations, find new parameter values. The optimization step has four substeps: 1. Sampling: For each sentence, sample uniformly at random Γ = 5000 pairs from the set of all candidate translations for that sentence from all previous iterations. 2. Selection: From these sampled pairs, select those for which the absolute difference between their BLEU+1 scores is higher than α = 0.05 (note: this is 5 BLEU+1 points). 3. Acceptance: For each sentence, accept the Ξ = 50 selected pairs with the highest absolute difference in their BLEU+1 scores. 4. Learning: Assemble the accepted pairs for all sentences into a single set and use it to train a ranker to prefer the higher-scoring sentence in each pair. We believe that monsters are nurtured by PRO’s selection and acceptance policies. PRO’s selection step filters pairs involving hypotheses that differ by less than five BLEU+1 points, but it does not cut-off ones that differ too much based on BLEU+1 or length. PRO’s acceptance step selects Ξ = 50 pairs with the highest BLEU+1 differentials, which creates breeding ground for monsters since these pairs are very likely to include one monster and one good hypothesis. Below we discuss monster slaying geared towards the selection and acceptance steps of PRO. 3.2 Slaying at Selection In the selection step, PRO filters pairs for which the difference in BLEU+1 is less than five points, but it has no cut-off on the maximum BLEU+1 differentials nor cut-offs based on absolute length or difference in length. Here, we propose several selection filters, both deterministic and probabilistic. Cut-offs. A cut-off is a deterministic rule that filters out pairs that do not comply with some criteria. We experiment with a maximal cut-off on (a) the difference in BLEU+1 scores and (b) the difference in lengths. These are relative cut-offs because they refer to the pair, but absolute cut-offs that apply to each of the elements in the pair are also possible (not explored here). Cut-offs (a) and (b) slay monsters by not allowing the negative examples to get much worse in BLEU+1 or in length than the positive example in the pair. Filtering outliers. Outliers are rare or extreme observations in a sample. We assume normal distribution of the BLEU+1 scores (or of the lengths) of the translation hypotheses for the same source sentence, and we define as outliers hypotheses whose BLEU+1 (or length) is more than λ standard deviations away from the sample average. We apply the outlier filter to both the positive and the negative example in a pair, but it is more important for the latter. We experiment with values of λ like 2 and 3. This filtering slays monsters because they are likely outliers. However, it will not work if the population gets riddled with monsters, in which case they would become the norm. Stochastic sampling. Instead of filtering extreme examples, we can randomly sample pairs according to their probability of being typical. Let us assume that the values of the local scoring functions, i.e., the BLEU+1 scores, are distributed nor- mally: g(i, j) ∼ N(µ, σ2). Given a sample of hypothesis (tira,nj)sl ∼atio Nn(sµ {j} of the same source sentpeontchee i, we can ensstim {ja}te o σ empirically. Then, the difference ∆ = g(i, j) − g(i, j0) would be tdhisetr diibfufteerde normally w gi(thi, mean zero and variance 2σ2. Now, given a pair of examples, we can calculate their ∆, and we can choose to select the pair with some probability, according to N(0, 2σ2). 3.3 Slaying at Acceptance Another problem is caused by the acceptance mechanism of PRO: among all selected pairs, it accepts the top-Ξ with the highest BLEU+1 differentials. It is easy to see that these differentials are highest for nonmonster–monster pairs if such pairs exist. One way to avoid focusing primarily on such pairs is to accept a random set of pairs, among the ones that survived the selection step. One possible caveat is that we can lose some of the discriminative power of PRO by focusing on examples that are not different enough. Ξ 14 TESTING TUNING (run 1, it. 25, avg.)

Then, we present the results for the various selection alternatives, both with the original acceptance strategy and with random acceptance. 4.1 Experimental Setup We used a phrase-based SMT model (Koehn et al., 2003) as implemented in the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007). We trained on all Arabic-English data for NIST 2012 except for UN, we tuned on (the longest-50% of) the MT06 sentences, and we tested on MT09. We used the MADA ATB segmentation for Arabic (Roth et al., 2008) and truecasing for English, phrases of maximal length 7, Kneser-Ney smoothing, and lexicalized reorder- ing (Koehn et al., 2005), and a 5-gram language model, trained on GigaWord v.5 using KenLM (Heafield, 2011). We dropped unknown words both at tuning and testing, and we used minimum Bayes risk decoding at testing (Kumar and Byrne, 2004). We evaluated the output with NIST’s scoring tool v.13a, cased. We used the Moses implementations of MERT, PRO and batch MIRA, with the –return-best-dev parameter for the latter. We ran these optimizers for up to 25 iterations and we used 1000-best lists. For stability (Foster and Kuhn, 2009), we performed three reruns of each experiment (tuning + evaluation), and we report averaged scores. 4.2 Selection Alternatives Table 3 presents the results for different selection alternatives. The first two columns show the testing results: average BLEU and standard deviation over three reruns. The following five columns show statistics about the last iteration (it. 25) of PRO’s tuning for the worst rerun: average lengths of the positive and the negative examples and average effective reference length, followed by average BLEU+1 scores for the positive and the negative examples in the pairs. The last two columns present the results when tuning on the full tuning set. These are included to verify the behavior of PRO in a nonmonster prone environment. We can see in Table 3 that all selection mechanisms considerably improve BLEU compared to the baseline PRO, by 2-3 BLEU points. However, not every selection alternative gets rid of monsters, which can be seen by the large lengths and low BLEU+1 for the negative examples (in bold). The max cut-offs for BLEU+1 and for lengths both slay the monsters, but the latter yields much lower standard deviation (thirteen times lower than for the baseline PRO!), thus considerably increasing PRO’s stability. On the full dataset, BLEU scores are about the same as for the original PRO (with small improvement for BLEU+1 max=20), but the standard deviations are slightly better. Rejecting outliers using BLEU+1 and λ = 3 is not strong enough to filter out monsters, but making this criterion more strict by setting λ = 2, yields competitive BLEU and kills the monsters. Rejecting outliers based on length does not work as effectively though. We can think of two possible reasons: (i) lengths are not normally distributed, they are more Poisson-like, and (ii) the acceptance criterion is based on the top-Ξ differentials based on BLEU+1, not based on length. On the full dataset, rejecting outliers, BLEU+1 and length, yields lower BLEU and less stability. 15 TESTING TUNING (run 1, it. 25, avg.)

The (††) indicates that random acceptance kills monsters. The asterisk (∗) indicates improved stability over random acceptance. Reasons (i) and (ii) arguably also apply to stochastic sampling of differentials (for BLEU+1 or for length), which fails to kill the monsters, maybe because it gives them some probability of being selected by design. To alleviate this, we test the above settings with random acceptance. 4.3 Random Acceptance Table 4 shows the results for accepting training pairs for PRO uniformly at random. To eliminate possible biases, we also removed the min=0.05 BLEU+1 selection criterion. Surprisingly, this setup effectively eliminated the monster problem. Further coupling this with the distributional criteria can also yield increased stability, and even small further increase in test BLEU. For instance, rejecting BLEU outliers with λ = 2 yields comparable average test BLEU, but with only half the standard deviation. On the other hand, using the stochastic sampling of differentials based on either BLEU+1 or lengths improves the test BLEU score while increasing the stability across runs. The random acceptance has a caveat though: it generally decreases the discriminative power of PRO, yielding worse results when tuning on the full, nonmonster prone tuning dataset. Stochastic selection does help to alleviate this problem. Yet, the results are not as good as when using a max cut-off for the length. Therefore, we recommend using the latter as a default setting. 5 Related Work We are not aware of previous work that discusses the issue of monsters, but there has been work on a different, length problem with PRO (Nakov et al., 2012). We have seen that its solution, fix the smoothing in BLEU+1, did not work for us. The stability of MERT has been improved using regularization (Cer et al., 2008), random restarts (Moore and Quirk, 2008), multiple replications (Clark et al., 2011), and parameter aggregation (Cettolo et al., 2011). With the emergence of new optimization techniques, there have been studies that compare stability between MIRA–MERT (Chiang et al., 2008; Chiang et al., 2009; Cherry and Foster, 2012), PRO–MERT (Hopkins and May, 2011), MIRA– PRO–MERT (Cherry and Foster, 2012; Gimpel and Smith, 2012; Nakov et al., 2012). Pathological verbosity can be an issue when tuning MERT on recall-oriented metrics such as METEOR (Lavie and Denkowski, 2009; Denkowski and Lavie, 2011). Large variance between the results obtained with MIRA has also been reported (Simianer et al., 2012). However, none of this work has focused on monsters. 6 Tale’s Moral and Future Battles We have studied a problem with PRO, namely that it can fall victim to monsters, overly long negative examples with very low BLEU+1 scores, which are unsuitable for learning. We have proposed several effective ways to address this problem, based on length- and BLEU+1-based cut-offs, outlier filters and stochastic sampling. The best of these fixes have not only slayed the monsters, but have also brought much higher stability to PRO as well as improved test-time BLEU scores. These benefits are less visible on the full dataset, but we still recommend them to everybody who uses PRO as protection against monsters. Monsters are inherent in PRO; they just do not always take over. In future work, we plan a deeper look at the mechanism of monster creation in PRO and its possible connection to PRO’s length bias. 16 References Daniel Cer, Daniel Jurafsky, and Christopher Manning. 2008.

<p>Author: Christian Hardmeier ; Sara Stymne ; Jorg Tiedemann ; Joakim Nivre</p><p>Abstract: We describe Docent, an open-source decoder for statistical machine translation that breaks with the usual sentence-bysentence paradigm and translates complete documents as units. By taking translation to the document level, our decoder can handle feature models with arbitrary discourse-wide dependencies and constitutes an essential infrastructure component in the quest for discourse-aware SMT models. 1 Motivation Most of the research on statistical machine translation (SMT) that was conducted during the last 20 years treated every text as a “bag of sentences” and disregarded all relations between elements in different sentences. Systematic research into explicitly discourse-related problems has only begun very recently in the SMT community (Hardmeier, 2012) with work on topics such as pronominal anaphora (Le Nagard and Koehn, 2010; Hardmeier and Federico, 2010; Guillou, 2012), verb tense (Gong et al., 2012) and discourse connectives (Meyer et al., 2012). One of the problems that hamper the development of cross-sentence models for SMT is the fact that the assumption of sentence independence is at the heart of the dynamic programming (DP) beam search algorithm most commonly used for decoding in phrase-based SMT systems (Koehn et al., 2003). For integrating cross-sentence features into the decoding process, researchers had to adopt strategies like two-pass decoding (Le Nagard and Koehn, 2010). We have previously proposed an algorithm for document-level phrase-based SMT decoding (Hardmeier et al., 2012). Our decoding algorithm is based on local search instead of dynamic programming and permits the integration of 193 document-level models with unrestricted dependencies, so that a model score can be conditioned on arbitrary elements occurring anywhere in the input document or in the translation that is being generated. In this paper, we present an open-source implementation of this search algorithm. The decoder is written in C++ and follows an objectoriented design that makes it easy to extend it with new feature models, new search operations or different types of local search algorithms. The code is released under the GNU General Public License and published on Github1 to make it easy for other researchers to use it in their own experiments. 2 Document-Level Decoding with Local Search Our decoder is based on the phrase-based SMT model described by Koehn et al. (2003) and implemented, for example, in the popular Moses decoder (Koehn et al., 2007). Translation is performed by splitting the input sentence into a number of contiguous word sequences, called phrases, which are translated into the target lan- guage through a phrase dictionary lookup and optionally reordered. The choice between different translations of an ambiguous source phrase and the ordering of the target phrases are guided by a scoring function that combines a set of scores taken from the phrase table with scores from other models such as an n-gram language model. The actual translation process is realised as a search for the highest-scoring translation in the space of all the possible translations that could be generated given the models. The decoding approach that is implemented in Docent was first proposed by Hardmeier et al. (2012) and is based on local search. This means that it has a state corresponding to a complete, if possibly bad, translation of a document at every 1https : //github .com/chardmeier/docent/wiki Proce dingSsof oifa, th Beu 5l1gsarti Aan,An u aglu Mste 4e-ti9n2g 0 o1f3 t.he ?c A2s0s1o3ci Aatsiosonc fioartio Cno fmorpu Ctoamtiopnuatalt Lioin gauli Lsitnicgsu,i psatgices 193–198, stage of the search progress. Search proceeds by making small changes to the current search state in order to transform it gradually into a better translation. This differs from the DP algorithm used in other decoders, which starts with an empty translation and expands it bit by bit. It is similar to previous work on phrase-based SMT decoding by Langlais et al. (2007), but enables the creation of document-level models, which was not addressed by earlier approaches. Docent currently implements two search algorithms that are different generalisations of the hill climbing local search algorithm by Hardmeier et al. (2012). The original hill climbing algorithm starts with an initial state and generates possible successor states by randomly applying simple elementary operations to the state. After each operation, the new state is scored and accepted if its score is better than that of the previous state, else rejected. Search terminates when the decoder cannot find an acceptable successor state after a certain number of attempts, or when a maximum number of steps is reached. Simulated annealing is a stochastic variant of hill climbing that always accepts moves towards better states, but can also accept moves towards lower-scoring states with a certain probability that depends on a temperature parameter in order to escape local maxima. Local beam search generalises hill climbing in a different way by keeping a beam of a fixed number of multiple states at any time and randomly picking a state from the beam to modify at each move. The original hill climbing procedure can be recovered as a special case of either one of these search algorithms, by calling simulated annealing with a fixed temperature of 0 or local beam search with a beam size of 1. Initial states for the search process can be generated either by selecting a random segmentation with random translations from the phrase table in monotonic order, or by running DP beam search with sentence-local models as a first pass. For the second option, which generally yields better search results, Docent is linked with the Moses decoder and makes direct calls to the DP beam search algorithm implemented by Moses. In addition to these state initialisation procedures, Docent can save a search state to a disk file which can be loaded again in a subsequent decoding pass. This saves time especially when running repeated experiments from the same starting point obtained 194 by DP search. In order to explore the complete search space of phrase-based SMT, the search operations in a local search decoder must be able to change the phrase translations, the order of the output phrases and the segmentation of the source sentence into phrases. The three operations used by Hardmeier et al. (2012), change-phrase-translation, resegment and swap-phrases, jointly meet this requirement and are all implemented in Docent. Additionally, Docent features three extra operations, all of which affect the target word order: The movephrases operation moves a phrase to another location in the sentence. Unlike swap-phrases, it does not require that another phrase be moved in the opposite direction at the same time. A pair of operations called permute-phrases and linearisephrasescanreorderasequenceofphrasesintorandom order and back into the order corresponding to the source language. Since the search algorithm in Docent is stochastic, repeated runs of the decoder will gen- erally produce different output. However, the variance of the output is usually small, especially when initialising with a DP search pass, and it tends to be lower than the variance introduced by feature weight tuning (Hardmeier et al., 2012; Stymne et al., 2013a). 3 Available Feature Models In its current version, Docent implements a selection of sentence-local feature models that makes it possible to build a baseline system with a configuration comparable to that of a typical Moses baseline system. The published source code also includes prototype implementations of a few document-level models. These models should be considered work in progress and serve as a demonstration of the cross-sentence modelling capabilities of the decoder. They have not yet reached a state of maturity that would make them suitable for production use. The sentence-level models provided by Docent include the phrase table, n-gram language models implemented with the KenLM toolkit (Heafield, 2011), an unlexicalised distortion cost model with geometric decay (Koehn et al., 2003) and a word penalty cost. All of these features are designed to be compatible with the corresponding features in Moses. From among the typical set of baseline features in Moses, we have not implemented the lexicalised distortion model, but this model could easily be added if required. Docent uses the same binary file format for phrase tables as Moses, so the same training apparatus can be used. DP-based SMT decoders have a parameter called distortion limit that limits the difference in word order between the input and the MT output. In DP search, this is formally considered to be a parameter of the search algorithm because it affects the algorithmic complexity of the search by controlling how many translation options must be considered at each hypothesis expansion. The stochastic search algorithm in Docent does not require this limitation, but it can still be useful because the standard models of SMT do not model long-distance reordering well. Docent therefore includes a separate indicator feature to indicate a violated distortion limit. In conjunction with a very large weight, this feature can effectively ensure that the distortion limit is enforced. In contrast with the distortion limit parameter of a DP decoder, the weight ofour distortion limit feature can potentially be tuned to permit occasional distortion limit violations when they contribute to better translations. The document-level models included in Docent include a length parity model, a semantic language model as well as a collection of documentlevel readability models. The length parity model is a proof-of-concept model that ensures that all sentences in a document have either consistently odd or consistently even length. It serves mostly as a template to demonstrate how a simple documentlevel model can be implemented in the decoder. The semantic language model was originally proposed by Hardmeier et al. (2012) to improve lexical cohesion in a document. It is a cross-sentence model over sequences of content words that are scored based on their similarity in a word vector space. The readability models serve to improve the readability of the translation by encouraging the selection of easier and more consistent target words. They are described and demonstrated in more detail in section 5. Docent can read input files both in the NISTXML format commonly used to encode documents in MT shared tasks such as NIST or WMT and in the more elaborate MMAX format (Müller and Strube, 2003). The MMAX format makes it possible to include a wide range of discourselevel corpus annotations such as coreference links. 195 These annotations can then be accessed by the feature models. To allow for additional targetlanguage information such as morphological features of target words, Docent can handle simple word-level annotations that are encoded in the phrase table in the same way as target language factors in Moses. In order to optimise feature weights we have adapted the Moses tuning infrastructure to Docent. In this way we can take advantage of all its features, for instance using different optimisation algorithms such as MERT (Och, 2003) or PRO (Hopkins and May, 2011), and selective tuning of a subset of features. Since document features only give meaningful scores on the document level and not on the sentence level, we naturally perform optimisation on document level, which typically means that we need more data than for the optimisation of sentence-based decoding. The results we obtain are relatively stable and competitive with sentence-level optimisation of the same models (Stymne et al., 2013a). 4 Implementing Feature Models Efficiently While translating a document, the local search decoder attempts to make a great number of moves. For each move, a score must be computed and tested against the acceptance criterion. An overwhelming majority of the proposed moves will be rejected. In order to achieve reasonably fast decoding times, efficient scoring is paramount. Recomputing the scores of the whole document at every step would be far too slow for the decoder to be useful. Fortunately, score computation can be sped up in two ways. Knowledge about how the state to be scored was generated from its predecessor helps to limit recomputations to a minimum, and by adopting a two-step scoring procedure that just computes the scores that can be calculated with little effort at first, we need to compute the complete score only if the new state has some chance of being accepted. The scores of SMT feature models can usually be decomposed in some way over parts of the document. The traditional models borrowed from sentence-based decoding are necessarily decomposable at the sentence level, and in practice, all common models are designed to meet the constraints of DP beam search, which ensures that they can in fact be decomposed over even smaller sequences of just a few words. For genuine document-level features, this is not the case, but even these models can often be decomposed in some way, for instance over paragraphs, anaphoric links or lexical chains. To take advantage of this fact, feature models in Docent always have access to the previous state and its score and to a list of the state modifications that transform the previous state into the next. The scores of the new state are calculated by identifying the parts of a document that are affected by the modifications, subtracting the old scores of this part from the previous score and adding the new scores. This approach to scoring makes feature model implementation a bit more complicated than in DP search, but it gives the feature models full control over how they decompose a document while still permitting efficient decoding. A feature model class in Docent implements three methods. The initDocument method is called once per document when decoding starts. It straightforwardly computes the model score for the entire document from scratch. When a state is modified, the decoder first invokes the estimateScoreUpdate method. Rather than calculating the new score exactly, this method is only required to return an upper bound that reflects the maximum score that could possibly be achieved by this state. The search algorithm then checks this upper bound against the acceptance criterion. Only if the upper bound meets the criterion does it call the updateScore method to calculate the exact score, which is then checked against the acceptance criterion again. The motivation for this two-step procedure is that some models can compute an upper bound approximation much more efficiently than an exact score. For any model whose score is a log probability, a value of 0 is a loose upper bound that can be returned instantly, but in many cases, we can do much better. In the case of the n-gram language model, for instance, a more accurate upper bound can be computed cheaply by subtracting from the old score all log-probabilities of n-grams that are affected by the state modifications without adding the scores of the n-grams replacing them in the new state. This approximation can be calculated without doing any language model lookups at all. On the other hand, some models like the distortion cost or the word penalty are very cheap to compute, so that the estimateScoreUpdate method 196 can simply return the precise score as a tight up- per bound. If a state gets rejected because of a low score on one of the cheap models, this means we will never have to compute the more expensive feature scores at all. 5 Readability: A Case Study As a case study we report initial results on how document-wide features can be used in Docent in order to improve the readability oftexts by encouraging simple and consistent terminology (Stymne et al., 2013b). This work is a first step towards achieving joint SMT and text simplification, with the final goal of adapting MT to user groups such as people with reading disabilities. Lexical consistency modelling for SMT has been attempted before. The suggested approaches have been limited by the use of sentence-level decoders, however, and had to resort to procedures like post processing (Carpuat, 2009), multiple decoding runs with frozen counts from previous runs (Ture et al., 2012), or cache-based models (Tiedemann, 2010). In Docent, however, we al- ways have access to a full document translation, which makes it straightforward to include features directly into the decoder. We implemented four features on the document level. The first two features are type token ratio (TTR) and a reformulation of it, OVIX, which is less sensitive to text length. These ratios have been related to the “idea density” of a text (Mühlenbock and Kokkinakis, 2009). We also wanted to encourage consistent translations of words, for which we used the Q-value (Deléger et al., 2006), which has been proposed to measure term quality. We applied it on word level (QW) and phrase level (QP). These features need access to the full target document, which we have in Docent. In addition, we included two sentence-level count features for long words that have been used to measure the readability of Swedish texts (Mühlenbock and Kokkinakis, 2009). We tested our features on English–Swedish translation using the Europarl corpus. For training we used 1,488,322 sentences. As test data, we extracted 20 documents with a total of 690 sen- tences. We used the standard set of baseline features: 5-gram language model, translation model with 5 weights, a word penalty and a distortion penalty.

Here we used OVIX to confirm a direct impact on con- sistency, and LIX (Björnsson, 1968), which is a common readability measure for Swedish. Unfortunately we do not have access to simplified translated text, so we calculate the MT metrics against a standard reference, which means that simple texts will likely have worse scores than complicated texts closer to the reference translation. We tuned the standard features using Moses and MERT, and then added each lexical consistency feature with a small weight, using a grid search approach to find values with a small impact. The results are shown in Table 1. As can be seen, for individual features the translation quality was maintained, with small improvements in LIX, and in OVIX for the TTR and OVIX features. For the combination we lost a little bit on translation quality, but there was a larger effect on the readability metrics. When we used larger weights, there was a bigger impact on the readability metrics, with a further decrease on MT quality. We also investigated what types of changes the readability features could lead to. Table 2 shows a sample of translations where the baseline is compared to systems with readability features. There are both cases where the readability features help 197 and cases where they are problematic. Overall, these examples show that our simple features can help achieve some interesting simplifications. There is still much work to do on how to take best advantage of the possibilities in Docent in order to achieve readable texts. This attempt shows the feasibility of the approach. We plan to extend this work for instance by better feature optimisation, by integrating part-of-speech tags into our features in order to focus on terms rather than common words, and by using simplified texts for evaluation and tuning. 6 Conclusions In this paper, we have presented Docent, an opensource document-level decoder for phrase-based SMT released under the GNU General Public License. Docent is the first decoder that permits the inclusion of feature models with unrestricted dependencies between arbitrary parts of the output, even crossing sentence boundaries. A number of research groups have recently started to investigate the interplay between SMT and discourse-level phenomena such as pronominal anaphora, verb tense selection and the generation of discourse connectives. We expect that the availability of a document-level decoder will make it substantially easier to leverage discourse information in SMT and make SMT models explore new ground beyond the next sentence boundary.

<p>Author: Spence Green ; Sida Wang ; Daniel Cer ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: We present a fast and scalable online method for tuning statistical machine translation models with large feature sets. The standard tuning algorithm—MERT—only scales to tens of features. Recent discriminative algorithms that accommodate sparse features have produced smaller than expected translation quality gains in large systems. Our method, which is based on stochastic gradient descent with an adaptive learning rate, scales to millions of features and tuning sets with tens of thousands of sentences, while still converging after only a few epochs. Large-scale experiments on Arabic-English and Chinese-English show that our method produces significant translation quality gains by exploiting sparse features. Equally important is our analysis, which suggests techniques for mitigating overfitting and domain mismatch, and applies to other recent discriminative methods for machine translation. 1</p><p>6 0.68962228 <a title="195-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Deepfix%3A_Statistical_Post-editing_of_Statistical_Machine_Translation_Using_Deep_Syntactic_Analysis.html">110 acl-2013-Deepfix: Statistical Post-editing of Statistical Machine Translation Using Deep Syntactic Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Chi-kiu Lo ; Karteek Addanki ; Markus Saers ; Dekai Wu</p><p>Abstract: We present the first ever results showing that tuning a machine translation system against a semantic frame based objective function, MEANT, produces more robustly adequate translations than tuning against BLEU or TER as measured across commonly used metrics and human subjective evaluation. Moreover, for informal web forum data, human evaluators preferred MEANT-tuned systems over BLEU- or TER-tuned systems by a significantly wider margin than that for formal newswire—even though automatic semantic parsing might be expected to fare worse on informal language. We argue thatbypreserving the meaning ofthe trans- lations as captured by semantic frames right in the training process, an MT system is constrained to make more accurate choices of both lexical and reordering rules. As a result, MT systems tuned against semantic frame based MT evaluation metrics produce output that is more adequate. Tuning a machine translation system against a semantic frame based objective function is independent ofthe translation model paradigm, so, any translation model can benefit from the semantic knowledge incorporated to improve translation adequacy through our approach.</p><p>3 0.91676402 <a title="195-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Development_and_Analysis_of_NLP_Pipelines_in_Argo.html">118 acl-2013-Development and Analysis of NLP Pipelines in Argo</a></p>
<p>Author: Rafal Rak ; Andrew Rowley ; Jacob Carter ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: Developing sophisticated NLP pipelines composed of multiple processing tools and components available through different providers may pose a challenge in terms of their interoperability. The Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) is an industry standard whose aim is to ensure such interoperability by defining common data structures and interfaces. The architecture has been gaining attention from industry and academia alike, resulting in a large volume ofUIMA-compliant processing components. In this paper, we demonstrate Argo, a Web-based workbench for the development and processing of NLP pipelines/workflows. The workbench is based upon UIMA, and thus has the potential of using many of the existing UIMA resources. We present features, and show examples, offacilitating the distributed development of components and the analysis of processing results. The latter includes annotation visualisers and editors, as well as serialisation to RDF format, which enables flexible querying in addition to data manipulation thanks to the semantic query language SPARQL. The distributed development feature allows users to seamlessly connect their tools to workflows running in Argo, and thus take advantage of both the available library of components (without the need of installing them locally) and the analytical tools.</p><p>4 0.9154703 <a title="195-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Travatar%3A_A_Forest-to-String_Machine_Translation_Engine_based_on_Tree_Transducers.html">361 acl-2013-Travatar: A Forest-to-String Machine Translation Engine based on Tree Transducers</a></p>
<p>Author: Graham Neubig</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we describe Travatar, a forest-to-string machine translation (MT) engine based on tree transducers. It provides an open-source C++ implementation for the entire forest-to-string MT pipeline, including rule extraction, tuning, decoding, and evaluation. There are a number of options for model training, and tuning includes advanced options such as hypergraph MERT, and training of sparse features through online learning. The training pipeline is modeled after that of the popular Moses decoder, so users familiar with Moses should be able to get started quickly. We perform a validation experiment of the decoder on EnglishJapanese machine translation, and find that it is possible to achieve greater accuracy than translation using phrase-based and hierarchical-phrase-based translation. As auxiliary results, we also compare different syntactic parsers and alignment techniques that we tested in the process of developing the decoder.

<p>Author: Brendan O'Connor ; Brandon M. Stewart ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We describe a new probabilistic model for extracting events between major political actors from news corpora. Our unsupervised model brings together familiar components in natural language processing (like parsers and topic models) with contextual political information— temporal and dyad dependence—to infer latent event classes. We quantitatively evaluate the model’s performance on political science benchmarks: recovering expert-assigned event class valences, and detecting real-world conflict. We also conduct a small case study based on our model’s inferences.

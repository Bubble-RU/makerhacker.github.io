<p>Author: Romain Deveaud ; Eric SanJuan ; Patrice Bellot</p><p>Abstract: The current topic modeling approaches for Information Retrieval do not allow to explicitly model query-oriented latent topics. More, the semantic coherence of the topics has never been considered in this field. We propose a model-based feedback approach that learns Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic models on the top-ranked pseudo-relevant feedback, and we measure the semantic coherence of those topics. We perform a first experimental evaluation using two major TREC test collections.

<p>Author: Sanjika Hewavitharana ; Dennis Mehay ; Sankaranarayanan Ananthakrishnan ; Prem Natarajan</p><p>Abstract: We describe a translation model adaptation approach for conversational spoken language translation (CSLT), which encourages the use of contextually appropriate translation options from relevant training conversations. Our approach employs a monolingual LDA topic model to derive a similarity measure between the test conversation and the set of training conversations, which is used to bias translation choices towards the current context. A significant novelty of our adaptation technique is its incremental nature; we continuously update the topic distribution on the evolving test conversation as new utterances become available. Thus, our approach is well-suited to the causal constraint of spoken conversations. On an English-to-Iraqi CSLT task, the proposed approach gives significant improvements over a baseline system as measured by BLEU, TER, and NIST. Interestingly, the incremental approach outperforms a non-incremental oracle that has up-front knowledge of the whole conversation.</p><p>6 0.11935867 <a title="73-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Evaluating_Text_Segmentation_using_Boundary_Edit_Distance.html">140 acl-2013-Evaluating Text Segmentation using Boundary Edit Distance</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthew Shardlow</p><p>Abstract: Identifying complex words (CWs) is an important, yet often overlooked, task within lexical simplification (The process of automatically replacing CWs with simpler alternatives). If too many words are identified then substitutions may be made erroneously, leading to a loss of meaning. If too few words are identified then those which impede a user’s understanding may be missed, resulting in a complex final text. This paper addresses the task of evaluating different methods for CW identification. A corpus of sentences with annotated CWs is mined from Simple Wikipedia edit histories, which is then used as the basis for several experiments. Firstly, the corpus design is explained and the results of the validation experiments using human judges are reported. Experiments are carried out into the CW identification techniques of: simplifying everything, frequency thresholding and training a support vector machine. These are based upon previous approaches to the task and show that thresholding does not perform significantly differently to the more na¨ ıve technique of simplifying everything. The support vector machine achieves a slight increase in precision over the other two methods, but at the cost of a dramatic trade off in recall.</p><p>3 0.59648854 <a title="73-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Linking_Tweets_to_News%3A_A_Framework_to_Enrich_Short_Text_Data_in_Social_Media.html">233 acl-2013-Linking Tweets to News: A Framework to Enrich Short Text Data in Social Media</a></p>
<p>Author: Weiwei Guo ; Hao Li ; Heng Ji ; Mona Diab</p><p>Abstract: Many current Natural Language Processing [NLP] techniques work well assuming a large context of text as input data. However they become ineffective when applied to short texts such as Twitter feeds. To overcome the issue, we want to find a related newswire document to a given tweet to provide contextual support for NLP tasks. This requires robust modeling and understanding of the semantics of short texts. The contribution of the paper is two-fold: 1. we introduce the Linking-Tweets-toNews task as well as a dataset of linked tweet-news pairs, which can benefit many NLP applications; 2. in contrast to previ- ous research which focuses on lexical features within the short texts (text-to-word information), we propose a graph based latent variable model that models the inter short text correlations (text-to-text information). This is motivated by the observation that a tweet usually only covers one aspect of an event. We show that using tweet specific feature (hashtag) and news specific feature (named entities) as well as temporal constraints, we are able to extract text-to-text correlations, and thus completes the semantic picture of a short text. Our experiments show significant improvement of our new model over baselines with three evaluation metrics in the new task.</p><p>4 0.59252799 <a title="73-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Improving_pairwise_coreference_models_through_feature_space_hierarchy_learning.html">196 acl-2013-Improving pairwise coreference models through feature space hierarchy learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Emmanuel Lassalle ; Pascal Denis</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for significantly improving the performance of pairwise coreference models. Given a set of indicators, our method learns how to best separate types of mention pairs into equivalence classes for which we construct distinct classification models. In effect, our approach finds an optimal feature space (derived from a base feature set and indicator set) for discriminating coreferential mention pairs. Although our approach explores a very large space of possible feature spaces, it remains tractable by exploiting the structure of the hierarchies built from the indicators. Our exper- iments on the CoNLL-2012 Shared Task English datasets (gold mentions) indicate that our method is robust relative to different clustering strategies and evaluation metrics, showing large and consistent improvements over a single pairwise model using the same base features. Our best system obtains a competitive 67.2 of average F1 over MUC, and CEAF which, despite its simplicity, places it above the mean score of other systems on these datasets.

<p>Author: Ryan Georgi ; Fei Xia ; William D. Lewis</p><p>Abstract: As most of the world’s languages are under-resourced, projection algorithms offer an enticing way to bootstrap the resources available for one resourcepoor language from a resource-rich language by means of parallel text and word alignment. These algorithms, however, make the strong assumption that the language pairs share common structures and that the parse trees will resemble one another. This assumption is useful but often leads to errors in projection. In this paper, we will address this weakness by using trees created from instances of Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT) to discover patterns of divergence between the lan- guages. We will show that this method improves the performance of projection algorithms significantly in some languages by accounting for divergence between languages using only the partial supervision of a few corrected trees.</p><p>6 0.58642453 <a title="73-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Collective_Annotation_of_Linguistic_Resources%3A_Basic_Principles_and_a_Formal_Model.html">83 acl-2013-Collective Annotation of Linguistic Resources: Basic Principles and a Formal Model</a></p>

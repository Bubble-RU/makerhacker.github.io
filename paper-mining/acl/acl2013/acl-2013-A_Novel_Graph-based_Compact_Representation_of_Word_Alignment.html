<p>Author: Xiaojun Quan ; Chunyu Kit ; Yan Song</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of nonmonotonic sentence alignment, motivated by the observation that coupled sentences in real bitexts do not necessarily occur monotonically, and proposes a semisupervised learning approach based on two assumptions: (1) sentences with high affinity in one language tend to have their counterparts with similar relatedness in the other; and (2) initial alignment is readily available with existing alignment techniques. They are incorporated as two constraints into a semisupervised learning framework for optimization to produce a globally optimal solution.

<p>Author: David Chiang ; Jacob Andreas ; Daniel Bauer ; Karl Moritz Hermann ; Bevan Jones ; Kevin Knight</p><p>Abstract: Hyperedge replacement grammar (HRG) is a formalism for generating and transforming graphs that has potential applications in natural language understanding and generation. A recognition algorithm due to Lautemann is known to be polynomial-time for graphs that are connected and of bounded degree. We present a more precise characterization of the algorithm’s complexity, an optimization analogous to binarization of contextfree grammars, and some important implementation details, resulting in an algorithm that is practical for natural-language applications. The algorithm is part of Bolinas, a new software toolkit for HRG processing.</p><p>4 0.16884333 <a title="15-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-A_Lightweight_and_High_Performance_Monolingual_Word_Aligner.html">9 acl-2013-A Lightweight and High Performance Monolingual Word Aligner</a></p>
<p>Author: Xuchen Yao ; Benjamin Van Durme ; Chris Callison-Burch ; Peter Clark</p><p>Abstract: Fast alignment is essential for many natural language tasks. But in the setting of monolingual alignment, previous work has not been able to align more than one sentence pair per second. We describe a discriminatively trained monolingual word aligner that uses a Conditional Random Field to globally decode the best alignment with features drawn from source and target sentences. Using just part-of-speech tags and WordNet as external resources, our aligner gives state-of-the-art result, while being an order-of-magnitude faster than the previous best performing system.</p><p>5 0.15995312 <a title="15-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-A_Shift-Reduce_Parsing_Algorithm_for_Phrase-based_String-to-Dependency_Translation.html">19 acl-2013-A Shift-Reduce Parsing Algorithm for Phrase-based String-to-Dependency Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a shift-reduce parsing algorithm for phrase-based string-todependency translation. As the algorithm generates dependency trees for partial translations left-to-right in decoding, it allows for efficient integration of both n-gram and dependency language models. To resolve conflicts in shift-reduce parsing, we propose a maximum entropy model trained on the derivation graph of training data. As our approach combines the merits of phrase-based and string-todependency models, it achieves significant improvements over the two baselines on the NIST Chinese-English datasets.</p><p>6 0.14197676 <a title="15-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Travatar%3A_A_Forest-to-String_Machine_Translation_Engine_based_on_Tree_Transducers.html">361 acl-2013-Travatar: A Forest-to-String Machine Translation Engine based on Tree Transducers</a></p>

<p>Author: Thomas Schoenemann</p><p>Abstract: We derive variants of the fertility based models IBM-3 and IBM-4 that, while maintaining their zero and first order parameters, are nondeficient. Subsequently, we proceed to derive a method to compute a likely alignment and its neighbors as well as give a solution of EM training. The arising M-step energies are non-trivial and handled via projected gradient ascent. Our evaluation on gold alignments shows substantial improvements (in weighted Fmeasure) for the IBM-3. For the IBM4 there are no consistent improvements. Training the nondeficient IBM-5 in the regular way gives surprisingly good results. Using the resulting alignments for phrase- based translation systems offers no clear insights w.r.t. BLEU scores.</p><p>4 0.75620842 <a title="15-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-A_Lightweight_and_High_Performance_Monolingual_Word_Aligner.html">9 acl-2013-A Lightweight and High Performance Monolingual Word Aligner</a></p>

<p>Author: Mengqiu Wang ; Wanxiang Che ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: Translated bi-texts contain complementary language cues, and previous work on Named Entity Recognition (NER) has demonstrated improvements in performance over monolingual taggers by promoting agreement of tagging decisions between the two languages. However, most previous approaches to bilingual tagging assume word alignments are given as fixed input, which can cause cascading errors. We observe that NER label information can be used to correct alignment mistakes, and present a graphical model that performs bilingual NER tagging jointly with word alignment, by combining two monolingual tagging models with two unidirectional alignment models. We intro- duce additional cross-lingual edge factors that encourage agreements between tagging and alignment decisions. We design a dual decomposition inference algorithm to perform joint decoding over the combined alignment and NER output space. Experiments on the OntoNotes dataset demonstrate that our method yields significant improvements in both NER and word alignment over state-of-the-art monolingual baselines.</p><p>6 0.66046596 <a title="15-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Exact_Maximum_Inference_for_the_Fertility_Hidden_Markov_Model.html">143 acl-2013-Exact Maximum Inference for the Fertility Hidden Markov Model</a></p>

Despite this potential, the process of manually creating rule-based information extractors that operate on dependency trees is not intuitive for persons without an extensive NLP background. In this system demonstration, we present a tool and a workflow designed to enable initiate users to interactively explore the effect and expressivity of creating Information Extraction rules over dependency trees. We introduce the proposed five step workflow for creating information extractors, the graph query based rule language, as well as the core features of the PROP- MINER tool.</p><p>3 0.74485928 <a title="15-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Bootstrapping_Entity_Translation_on_Weakly_Comparable_Corpora.html">71 acl-2013-Bootstrapping Entity Translation on Weakly Comparable Corpora</a></p>
<p>Author: Taesung Lee ; Seung-won Hwang</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of mining named entity translations from comparable corpora with some “asymmetry”. Unlike the previous approaches relying on the “symmetry” found in parallel corpora, the proposed method is tolerant to asymmetry often found in comparable corpora, by distinguishing different semantics of relations of entity pairs to selectively propagate seed entity translations on weakly comparable corpora. Our experimental results on English-Chinese corpora show that our selective propagation approach outperforms the previous approaches in named entity translation in terms of the mean reciprocal rank by up to 0.16 for organization names, and 0.14 in a low com- parability case.</p><p>4 0.74192941 <a title="15-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Learning_Latent_Personas_of_Film_Characters.html">220 acl-2013-Learning Latent Personas of Film Characters</a></p>
<p>Author: David Bamman ; Brendan O'Connor ; Noah A.

These lexical classes capture the stereotypical actions of which a character is the agent and patient, as well as attributes by which they are described. As the first attempt to solve this problem explicitly, we also present a new dataset for the text-driven analysis of film, along with a benchmark testbed to help drive future work in this area.</p><p>5 0.68388838 <a title="15-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-The_Role_of_Syntax_in_Vector_Space_Models_of_Compositional_Semantics.html">347 acl-2013-The Role of Syntax in Vector Space Models of Compositional Semantics</a></p>
<p>Author: Karl Moritz Hermann ; Phil Blunsom</p><p>Abstract: Modelling the compositional process by which the meaning of an utterance arises from the meaning of its parts is a fundamental task of Natural Language Processing. In this paper we draw upon recent advances in the learning of vector space representations of sentential semantics and the transparent interface between syntax and semantics provided by Combinatory Categorial Grammar to introduce Combinatory Categorial Autoencoders. This model leverages the CCG combinatory operators to guide a non-linear transformation of meaning within a sentence. We use this model to learn high dimensional embeddings for sentences and evaluate them in a range of tasks, demonstrating that the incorporation of syntax allows a concise model to learn representations that are both effective and general.</p><p>6 0.68226874 <a title="15-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Parsing_with_Compositional_Vector_Grammars.html">275 acl-2013-Parsing with Compositional Vector Grammars</a></p>

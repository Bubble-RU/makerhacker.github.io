<p>Author: Mohammad Taher Pilehvar ; David Jurgens ; Roberto Navigli</p><p>Abstract: Semantic similarity is an essential component of many Natural Language Processing applications. However, prior methods for computing semantic similarity often operate at different levels, e.g., single words or entire documents, which requires adapting the method for each data type. We present a unified approach to semantic similarity that operates at multiple levels, all the way from comparing word senses to comparing text documents. Our method leverages a common probabilistic representation over word senses in order to compare different types of linguistic data. This unified representation shows state-ofthe-art performance on three tasks: seman- tic textual similarity, word similarity, and word sense coarsening.</p><p>3 0.30125356 <a title="111-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-DKPro_WSD%3A_A_Generalized_UIMA-based_Framework_for_Word_Sense_Disambiguation.html">105 acl-2013-DKPro WSD: A Generalized UIMA-based Framework for Word Sense Disambiguation</a></p>
<p>Author: Tristan Miller ; Nicolai Erbs ; Hans-Peter Zorn ; Torsten Zesch ; Iryna Gurevych</p><p>Abstract: Implementations of word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithms tend to be tied to a particular test corpus format and sense inventory. This makes it difficult to test their performance on new data sets, or to compare them against past algorithms implemented for different data sets. In this paper we present DKPro WSD, a freely licensed, general-purpose framework for WSD which is both modular and extensible. DKPro WSD abstracts the WSD process in such a way that test corpora, sense inventories, and algorithms can be freely swapped. Its UIMA-based architecture makes it easy to add support for new resources and algorithms. Related tasks such as word sense induction and entity linking are also supported.</p><p>4 0.24672773 <a title="111-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Neighbors_Help%3A_Bilingual_Unsupervised_WSD_Using_Context.html">258 acl-2013-Neighbors Help: Bilingual Unsupervised WSD Using Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Sudha Bhingardive ; Samiulla Shaikh ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is one of the toughest problems in NLP, and in WSD, verb disambiguation has proved to be extremely difficult, because of high degree of polysemy, too fine grained senses, absence of deep verb hierarchy and low inter annotator agreement in verb sense annotation. Unsupervised WSD has received widespread attention, but has performed poorly, specially on verbs. Recently an unsupervised bilingual EM based algorithm has been proposed, which makes use only of the raw counts of the translations in comparable corpora (Marathi and Hindi). But the performance of this approach is poor on verbs with accuracy level at 25-38%. We suggest a modifica- tion to this mentioned formulation, using context and semantic relatedness of neighboring words. An improvement of 17% 35% in the accuracy of verb WSD is obtained compared to the existing EM based approach. On a general note, the work can be looked upon as contributing to the framework of unsupervised WSD through context aware expectation maximization.</p><p>5 0.19469398 <a title="111-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-SenseSpotting%3A_Never_let_your_parallel_data_tie_you_to_an_old_domain.html">316 acl-2013-SenseSpotting: Never let your parallel data tie you to an old domain</a></p>
<p>Author: Marine Carpuat ; Hal Daume III ; Katharine Henry ; Ann Irvine ; Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi ; Rachel Rudinger</p><p>Abstract: Words often gain new senses in new domains. Being able to automatically identify, from a corpus of monolingual text, which word tokens are being used in a previously unseen sense has applications to machine translation and other tasks sensitive to lexical semantics. We define a task, SENSESPOTTING, in which we build systems to spot tokens that have new senses in new domain text. Instead of difficult and expensive annotation, we build a goldstandard by leveraging cheaply available parallel corpora, targeting our approach to the problem of domain adaptation for machine translation. Our system is able to achieve F-measures of as much as 80%, when applied to word types it has never seen before. Our approach is based on a large set of novel features that capture varied aspects of how words change when used in new domains.</p><p>6 0.14312163 <a title="111-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Automatic_Term_Ambiguity_Detection.html">62 acl-2013-Automatic Term Ambiguity Detection</a></p>

A temporal tagger retrieves and normalizes dates mentioned informally in social media to actual month and year referents. Building on this, an event date extraction system learns to integrate the likelihood of candidate dates extracted from time-rich sentences with temporal constraints extracted from eventrelated sentences. Our integrated model achieves 89.7% of the maximum performance given the performance of the temporal expression retrieval step.</p><p>2 0.8168028 <a title="111-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Bilingual_Data_Cleaning_for_SMT_using_Graph-based_Random_Walk.html">68 acl-2013-Bilingual Data Cleaning for SMT using Graph-based Random Walk</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Cui ; Dongdong Zhang ; Shujie Liu ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: The quality of bilingual data is a key factor in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). Low-quality bilingual data tends to produce incorrect translation knowledge and also degrades translation modeling performance. Previous work often used supervised learning methods to filter lowquality data, but a fair amount of human labeled examples are needed which are not easy to obtain. To reduce the reliance on labeled examples, we propose an unsupervised method to clean bilingual data. The method leverages the mutual reinforcement between the sentence pairs and the extracted phrase pairs, based on the observation that better sentence pairs often lead to better phrase extraction and vice versa. End-to-end experiments show that the proposed method substantially improves the performance in largescale Chinese-to-English translation tasks.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.81045389 <a title="111-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Density_Maximization_in_Context-Sense_Metric_Space_for_All-words_WSD.html">111 acl-2013-Density Maximization in Context-Sense Metric Space for All-words WSD</a></p>

Experimental results confirmed the superiority of the proposed method over conventional ones by showing the better performances beyond most-frequent-sense baseline performance where none of SemEval2 unsupervised systems reached.</p><p>4 0.78454387 <a title="111-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-An_Empirical_Examination_of_Challenges_in_Chinese_Parsing.html">44 acl-2013-An Empirical Examination of Challenges in Chinese Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan K. Kummerfeld ; Daniel Tse ; James R. Curran ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Aspects of Chinese syntax result in a distinctive mix of parsing challenges. However, the contribution of individual sources of error to overall difficulty is not well understood. We conduct a comprehensive automatic analysis of error types made by Chinese parsers, covering a broad range of error types for large sets of sentences, enabling the first empirical ranking of Chinese error types by their performance impact. We also investigate which error types are resolved by using gold part-of-speech tags, showing that improving Chinese tagging only addresses certain error types, leaving substantial outstanding challenges.</p><p>5 0.76222992 <a title="111-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Word_Alignment_Modeling_with_Context_Dependent_Deep_Neural_Network.html">388 acl-2013-Word Alignment Modeling with Context Dependent Deep Neural Network</a></p>
<p>Author: Nan Yang ; Shujie Liu ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou ; Nenghai Yu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore a novel bilingual word alignment approach based on DNN (Deep Neural Network), which has been proven to be very effective in various machine learning tasks (Collobert et al., 2011). We describe in detail how we adapt and extend the CD-DNNHMM (Dahl et al., 2012) method introduced in speech recognition to the HMMbased word alignment model, in which bilingual word embedding is discriminatively learnt to capture lexical translation information, and surrounding words are leveraged to model context information in bilingual sentences. While being capable to model the rich bilingual correspondence, our method generates a very compact model with much fewer parameters. Experiments on a large scale EnglishChinese word alignment task show that the proposed method outperforms the HMM and IBM model 4 baselines by 2 points in F-score.</p><p>6 0.75361437 <a title="111-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Syntactic_Patterns_versus_Word_Alignment%3A_Extracting_Opinion_Targets_from_Online_Reviews.html">336 acl-2013-Syntactic Patterns versus Word Alignment: Extracting Opinion Targets from Online Reviews</a></p>

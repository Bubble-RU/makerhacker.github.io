This tutorial explores connections between early decipherment research and today’s NLP work. We cover classic military and diplomatic ciphers, automatic decipherment algorithms, unsolved ciphers, language translation as decipherment, and analyzing ancient writing as decipherment. 1 Tutorial Overview The first natural language processing systems had a straightforward goal: decipher coded messages sent by the enemy. Sixty years later, we have many more applications, including web search, question answering, summarization, speech recognition, and language translation. This tutorial explores connections between early decipherment research and today’s NLP work. We find that many ideas from the earlier era have become core to the field, while others still remain to be picked up and developed. We first cover classic military and diplomatic cipher types, including complex substitution ciphers implemented in the first electro-mechanical encryption machines. We look at mathematical tools (language recognition, frequency counting, smoothing) developed to decrypt such ciphers on proto-computers. We show algorithms and extensive empirical results for solving different types of ciphers, and we show the role of algorithms in recent decipherments of historical documents. We then look at how foreign language can be viewed as a code for English, a concept developed by Alan Turing and Warren Weaver. We describe recently published work on building automatic translation systems from non-parallel data. We also demonstrate how some of the same algorithmic tools can be applied to natural language tasks like part-of-speech tagging and word alignment. Turning back to historical ciphers, we explore a number of unsolved ciphers, giving results of initial computer experiments on several of them. Finally, we look briefly at writing as a way to encipher phoneme sequences, covering ancient scripts and modern applications. 2 Outline 1.

<p>Author: Malte Nuhn ; Julian Schamper ; Hermann Ney</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of solving substitution ciphers using a beam search approach. We present a conceptually consistent and easy to implement method that improves the current state of the art for decipherment of substitution ciphers and is able to use high order n-gram language models. We show experiments with 1:1 substitution ciphers in which the guaranteed optimal solution for 3-gram language models has 38.6% decipherment error, while our approach achieves 4.13% decipherment error in a fraction of time by using a 6-gram language model. We also apply our approach to the famous Zodiac-408 cipher and obtain slightly bet- ter (and near to optimal) results than previously published. Unlike the previous state-of-the-art approach that uses additional word lists to evaluate possible decipherments, our approach only uses a letterbased 6-gram language model. Furthermore we use our algorithm to solve large vocabulary substitution ciphers and improve the best published decipherment error rate based on the Gigaword corpus of 7.8% to 6.0% error rate.</p><p>3 0.31208256 <a title="108-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Decipherment_Complexity_in_1%3A1_Substitution_Ciphers.html">109 acl-2013-Decipherment Complexity in 1:1 Substitution Ciphers</a></p>
<p>Author: Malte Nuhn ; Hermann Ney</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we show that even for the case of 1:1 substitution ciphers—which encipher plaintext symbols by exchanging them with a unique substitute—finding the optimal decipherment with respect to a bigram language model is NP-hard. We show that in this case the decipherment problem is equivalent to the quadratic assignment problem (QAP). To the best of our knowledge, this connection between the QAP and the decipherment problem has not been known in the literature before.</p><p>4 0.15936449 <a title="108-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Scalable_Decipherment_for_Machine_Translation_via_Hash_Sampling.html">307 acl-2013-Scalable Decipherment for Machine Translation via Hash Sampling</a></p>
<p>Author: Sujith Ravi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new Bayesian inference method to train statistical machine translation systems using only nonparallel corpora. Following a probabilistic decipherment approach, we first introduce a new framework for decipherment training that is flexible enough to incorporate any number/type of features (besides simple bag-of-words) as side-information used for estimating translation models. In order to perform fast, efficient Bayesian inference in this framework, we then derive a hash sampling strategy that is inspired by the work of Ahmed et al. (2012). The new translation hash sampler enables us to scale elegantly to complex models (for the first time) and large vocab- ulary/corpora sizes. We show empirical results on the OPUS data—our method yields the best BLEU scores compared to existing approaches, while achieving significant computational speedups (several orders faster). We also report for the first time—BLEU score results for a largescale MT task using only non-parallel data (EMEA corpus).</p><p>5 0.085511848 <a title="108-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Unsupervised_Consonant-Vowel_Prediction_over_Hundreds_of_Languages.html">369 acl-2013-Unsupervised Consonant-Vowel Prediction over Hundreds of Languages</a></p>
<p>Author: Young-Bum Kim ; Benjamin Snyder</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a solution to one aspect of the decipherment task: the prediction of consonants and vowels for an unknown language and alphabet. Adopting a classical Bayesian perspective, we performs posterior inference over hundreds of languages, leveraging knowledge of known languages and alphabets to uncover general linguistic patterns of typologically coherent language clusters. We achieve average accuracy in the unsupervised consonant/vowel prediction task of 99% across 503 languages. We further show that our methodology can be used to predict more fine-grained phonetic distinctions. On a three-way classification task between vowels, nasals, and nonnasal consonants, our model yields unsu- pervised accuracy of 89% across the same set of languages.</p><p>6 0.054125108 <a title="108-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Variational_Inference_for_Structured_NLP_Models.html">382 acl-2013-Variational Inference for Structured NLP Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Kevin Knight</p><p>Abstract: The first natural language processing systems had a straightforward goal: decipher coded messages sent by the enemy. This tutorial explores connections between early decipherment research and today’s NLP work. We cover classic military and diplomatic ciphers, automatic decipherment algorithms, unsolved ciphers, language translation as decipherment, and analyzing ancient writing as decipherment. 1 Tutorial Overview The first natural language processing systems had a straightforward goal: decipher coded messages sent by the enemy. Sixty years later, we have many more applications, including web search, question answering, summarization, speech recognition, and language translation. This tutorial explores connections between early decipherment research and today’s NLP work. We find that many ideas from the earlier era have become core to the field, while others still remain to be picked up and developed. We first cover classic military and diplomatic cipher types, including complex substitution ciphers implemented in the first electro-mechanical encryption machines. We look at mathematical tools (language recognition, frequency counting, smoothing) developed to decrypt such ciphers on proto-computers. We show algorithms and extensive empirical results for solving different types of ciphers, and we show the role of algorithms in recent decipherments of historical documents. We then look at how foreign language can be viewed as a code for English, a concept developed by Alan Turing and Warren Weaver. We describe recently published work on building automatic translation systems from non-parallel data. We also demonstrate how some of the same algorithmic tools can be applied to natural language tasks like part-of-speech tagging and word alignment. Turning back to historical ciphers, we explore a number of unsolved ciphers, giving results of initial computer experiments on several of them. Finally, we look briefly at writing as a way to encipher phoneme sequences, covering ancient scripts and modern applications. 2 Outline 1.

<p>Author: Malte Nuhn ; Hermann Ney</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we show that even for the case of 1:1 substitution ciphers—which encipher plaintext symbols by exchanging them with a unique substitute—finding the optimal decipherment with respect to a bigram language model is NP-hard. We show that in this case the decipherment problem is equivalent to the quadratic assignment problem (QAP). To the best of our knowledge, this connection between the QAP and the decipherment problem has not been known in the literature before.</p><p>3 0.90808779 <a title="108-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Beam_Search_for_Solving_Substitution_Ciphers.html">66 acl-2013-Beam Search for Solving Substitution Ciphers</a></p>
<p>Author: Malte Nuhn ; Julian Schamper ; Hermann Ney</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of solving substitution ciphers using a beam search approach. We present a conceptually consistent and easy to implement method that improves the current state of the art for decipherment of substitution ciphers and is able to use high order n-gram language models. We show experiments with 1:1 substitution ciphers in which the guaranteed optimal solution for 3-gram language models has 38.6% decipherment error, while our approach achieves 4.13% decipherment error in a fraction of time by using a 6-gram language model. We also apply our approach to the famous Zodiac-408 cipher and obtain slightly bet- ter (and near to optimal) results than previously published. Unlike the previous state-of-the-art approach that uses additional word lists to evaluate possible decipherments, our approach only uses a letterbased 6-gram language model. Furthermore we use our algorithm to solve large vocabulary substitution ciphers and improve the best published decipherment error rate based on the Gigaword corpus of 7.8% to 6.0% error rate.</p><p>4 0.36552215 <a title="108-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Scalable_Decipherment_for_Machine_Translation_via_Hash_Sampling.html">307 acl-2013-Scalable Decipherment for Machine Translation via Hash Sampling</a></p>
<p>Author: Sujith Ravi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new Bayesian inference method to train statistical machine translation systems using only nonparallel corpora. Following a probabilistic decipherment approach, we first introduce a new framework for decipherment training that is flexible enough to incorporate any number/type of features (besides simple bag-of-words) as side-information used for estimating translation models. In order to perform fast, efficient Bayesian inference in this framework, we then derive a hash sampling strategy that is inspired by the work of Ahmed et al. (2012). The new translation hash sampler enables us to scale elegantly to complex models (for the first time) and large vocab- ulary/corpora sizes. We show empirical results on the OPUS data—our method yields the best BLEU scores compared to existing approaches, while achieving significant computational speedups (several orders faster). We also report for the first time—BLEU score results for a largescale MT task using only non-parallel data (EMEA corpus).</p><p>5 0.25593805 <a title="108-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Unsupervised_Consonant-Vowel_Prediction_over_Hundreds_of_Languages.html">369 acl-2013-Unsupervised Consonant-Vowel Prediction over Hundreds of Languages</a></p>
<p>Author: Young-Bum Kim ; Benjamin Snyder</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a solution to one aspect of the decipherment task: the prediction of consonants and vowels for an unknown language and alphabet. Adopting a classical Bayesian perspective, we performs posterior inference over hundreds of languages, leveraging knowledge of known languages and alphabets to uncover general linguistic patterns of typologically coherent language clusters. We achieve average accuracy in the unsupervised consonant/vowel prediction task of 99% across 503 languages. We further show that our methodology can be used to predict more fine-grained phonetic distinctions. On a three-way classification task between vowels, nasals, and nonnasal consonants, our model yields unsu- pervised accuracy of 89% across the same set of languages.</p><p>6 0.23881643 <a title="108-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Unsupervised_Transcription_of_Historical_Documents.html">370 acl-2013-Unsupervised Transcription of Historical Documents</a></p>

<p>Author: Enrique Alfonseca ; Daniele Pighin ; Guillermo Garrido</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents HEADY: a novel, abstractive approach for headline generation from news collections. From a web-scale corpus of English news, we mine syntactic patterns that a Noisy-OR model generalizes into event descriptions. At inference time, we query the model with the patterns observed in an unseen news collection, identify the event that better captures the gist of the collection and retrieve the most appropriate pattern to generate a headline. HEADY improves over a state-of-theart open-domain title abstraction method, bridging half of the gap that separates it from extractive methods using humangenerated titles in manual evaluations, and performs comparably to human-generated headlines as evaluated with ROUGE.</p><p>5 0.56623286 <a title="108-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Neighbors_Help%3A_Bilingual_Unsupervised_WSD_Using_Context.html">258 acl-2013-Neighbors Help: Bilingual Unsupervised WSD Using Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Sudha Bhingardive ; Samiulla Shaikh ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is one of the toughest problems in NLP, and in WSD, verb disambiguation has proved to be extremely difficult, because of high degree of polysemy, too fine grained senses, absence of deep verb hierarchy and low inter annotator agreement in verb sense annotation. Unsupervised WSD has received widespread attention, but has performed poorly, specially on verbs. Recently an unsupervised bilingual EM based algorithm has been proposed, which makes use only of the raw counts of the translations in comparable corpora (Marathi and Hindi). But the performance of this approach is poor on verbs with accuracy level at 25-38%. We suggest a modifica- tion to this mentioned formulation, using context and semantic relatedness of neighboring words. An improvement of 17% 35% in the accuracy of verb WSD is obtained compared to the existing EM based approach. On a general note, the work can be looked upon as contributing to the framework of unsupervised WSD through context aware expectation maximization.</p><p>6 0.36864984 <a title="108-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Adaptive_Parser-Centric_Text_Normalization.html">37 acl-2013-Adaptive Parser-Centric Text Normalization</a></p>

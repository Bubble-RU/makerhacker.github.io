<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2012-8-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P12/P12-2049.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: John Lee ; Jonathan Webster</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes the creation of the first large-scale corpus containing drafts and final versions of essays written by non-native speakers, with the sentences aligned across different versions. Furthermore, the sentences in the drafts are annotated with comments from teachers. The corpus is intended to support research on textual revision by language learners, and how it is influenced by feedback. This corpus has been converted into an XML format conforming to the standards of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI).</p><br/>

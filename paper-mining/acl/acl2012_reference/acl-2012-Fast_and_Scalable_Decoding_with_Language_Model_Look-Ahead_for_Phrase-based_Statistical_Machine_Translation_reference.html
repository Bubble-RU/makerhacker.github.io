<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2012-97-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P12/P12-2006.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Joern Wuebker ; Hermann Ney ; Richard Zens</p><p>Abstract: In this work we present two extensions to the well-known dynamic programming beam search in phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT), aiming at increased efficiency of decoding by minimizing the number of language model computations and hypothesis expansions. Our results show that language model based pre-sorting yields a small improvement in translation quality and a speedup by a factor of 2. Two look-ahead methods are shown to further increase translation speed by a factor of2 without changing the search space and a factor of 4 with the side-effect of some additional search errors. We compare our ap- proach with Moses and observe the same performance, but a substantially better trade-off between translation quality and speed. At a speed of roughly 70 words per second, Moses reaches 17.2% BLEU, whereas our approach yields 20.0% with identical models.</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2012-100-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P12/P12-2065.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Lei Fang ; Minlie Huang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a structural learning model forjoint sentiment classification and aspect analysis of text at various levels of granularity. Our model aims to identify highly informative sentences that are aspect-specific in online custom reviews. The primary advantages of our model are two-fold: first, it performs document-level and sentence-level sentiment polarity classification jointly; second, it is able to find informative sentences that are closely related to some respects in a review, which may be helpful for aspect-level sentiment analysis such as aspect-oriented summarization. The proposed method was evaluated with 9,000 Chinese restaurant reviews. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that our model obtains promising performance. 1</p><br/>

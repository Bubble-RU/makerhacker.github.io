<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2012-85-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P12/P12-2045.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Joel Nothman ; Matthew Honnibal ; Ben Hachey ; James R. Curran</p><p>Abstract: Interpreting news requires identifying its constituent events. Events are complex linguistically and ontologically, so disambiguating their reference is challenging. We introduce event linking, which canonically labels an event reference with the article where it was first reported. This implicitly relaxes coreference to co-reporting, and will practically enable augmenting news archives with semantic hyperlinks. We annotate and analyse a corpus of 150 documents, extracting 501 links to a news archive with reasonable inter-annotator agreement.</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2012-148-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P12/P12-1050.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Arianna Bisazza ; Marcello Federico</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel method to suggest long word reorderings to a phrase-based SMT decoder. We address language pairs where long reordering concentrates on few patterns, and use fuzzy chunk-based rules to predict likely reorderings for these phenomena. Then we use reordered n-gram LMs to rank the resulting permutations and select the n-best for translation. Finally we encode these reorderings by modifying selected entries of the distortion cost matrix, on a per-sentence basis. In this way, we expand the search space by a much finer degree than if we simply raised the distortion limit. The proposed techniques are tested on Arabic-English and German-English using well-known SMT benchmarks.</p><br/>

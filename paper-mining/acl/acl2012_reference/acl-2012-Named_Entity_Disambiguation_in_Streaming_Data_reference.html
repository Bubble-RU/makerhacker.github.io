<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2012-153-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P12/P12-1086.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Alexandre Davis ; Adriano Veloso ; Altigran Soares ; Alberto Laender ; Wagner Meira Jr.</p><p>Abstract: The named entity disambiguation task is to resolve the many-to-many correspondence between ambiguous names and the unique realworld entity. This task can be modeled as a classification problem, provided that positive and negative examples are available for learning binary classifiers. High-quality senseannotated data, however, are hard to be obtained in streaming environments, since the training corpus would have to be constantly updated in order to accomodate the fresh data coming on the stream. On the other hand, few positive examples plus large amounts of unlabeled data may be easily acquired. Producing binary classifiers directly from this data, however, leads to poor disambiguation performance. Thus, we propose to enhance the quality of the classifiers using finer-grained variations of the well-known ExpectationMaximization (EM) algorithm. We conducted a systematic evaluation using Twitter streaming data and the results show that our classifiers are extremely effective, providing improvements ranging from 1% to 20%, when compared to the current state-of-the-art biased SVMs, being more than 120 times faster.</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2012-65-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P12/P12-2031.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Naomi Zeichner ; Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: The importance of inference rules to semantic applications has long been recognized and extensive work has been carried out to automatically acquire inference-rule resources. However, evaluating such resources has turned out to be a non-trivial task, slowing progress in the field. In this paper, we suggest a framework for evaluating inference-rule resources. Our framework simplifies a previously proposed “instance-based evaluation” method that involved substantial annotator training, making it suitable for crowdsourcing. We show that our method produces a large amount of annotations with high inter-annotator agreement for a low cost at a short period of time, without requiring training expert annotators.</p><br/>

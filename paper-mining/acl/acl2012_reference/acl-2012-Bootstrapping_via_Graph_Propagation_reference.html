<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2012-42-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P12/P12-1065.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Max Whitney ; Anoop Sarkar</p><p>Abstract: Bootstrapping a classifier from a small set of seed rules can be viewed as the propagation of labels between examples via features shared between them. This paper introduces a novel variant of the Yarowsky algorithm based on this view. It is a bootstrapping learning method which uses a graph propagation algorithm with a well defined objective function. The experimental results show that our proposed bootstrapping algorithm achieves state of the art performance or better on several different natural language data sets.</p><br/>

<h1>98 acl-2012-Finding Bursty Topics from Microblogs</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2012-98-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P12/P12-1056.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Qiming Diao ; Jing Jiang ; Feida Zhu ; Ee-Peng Lim</p><p>Abstract: Microblogs such as Twitter reflect the general public’s reactions to major events. Bursty topics from microblogs reveal what events have attracted the most online attention. Although bursty event detection from text streams has been studied before, previous work may not be suitable for microblogs because compared with other text streams such as news articles and scientific publications, microblog posts are particularly diverse and noisy. To find topics that have bursty patterns on microblogs, we propose a topic model that simultaneously captures two observations: (1) posts published around the same time are more likely to have the same topic, and (2) posts published by the same user are more likely to have the same topic. The former helps find eventdriven posts while the latter helps identify and filter out “personal” posts. Our experiments on a large Twitter dataset show that there are more meaningful and unique bursty topics in the top-ranked results returned by our model than an LDA baseline and two degenerate variations of our model. We also show some case studies that demonstrate the importance of considering both the temporal information and users’ personal interests for bursty topic detection from microblogs.</p><br/>

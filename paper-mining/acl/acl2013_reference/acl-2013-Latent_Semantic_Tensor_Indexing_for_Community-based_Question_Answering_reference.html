<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-218-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-2077.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Xipeng Qiu ; Le Tian ; Xuanjing Huang</p><p>Abstract: Retrieving similar questions is very important in community-based question answering(CQA) . In this paper, we propose a unified question retrieval model based on latent semantic indexing with tensor analysis, which can capture word associations among different parts of CQA triples simultaneously. Thus, our method can reduce lexical chasm of question retrieval with the help of the information of question content and answer parts. The experimental result shows that our method outperforms the traditional methods.</p><br/>

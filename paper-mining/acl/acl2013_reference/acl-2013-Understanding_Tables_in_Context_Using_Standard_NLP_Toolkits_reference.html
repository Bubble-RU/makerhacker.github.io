<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-365-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-2116.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Vidhya Govindaraju ; Ce Zhang ; Christopher Re</p><p>Abstract: Tabular information in text documents contains a wealth of information, and so tables are a natural candidate for information extraction. There are many cues buried in both a table and its surrounding text that allow us to understand the meaning of the data in a table. We study how natural-language tools, such as part-of-speech tagging, dependency paths, and named-entity recognition, can be used to improve the quality of relation extraction from tables. In three domains we show that (1) a model that performs joint probabilistic inference across tabular and natural language features achieves an F1 score that is twice as high as either a puretable or pure-text system, and (2) using only shallower features or non-joint inference results in lower quality.</p><br/>

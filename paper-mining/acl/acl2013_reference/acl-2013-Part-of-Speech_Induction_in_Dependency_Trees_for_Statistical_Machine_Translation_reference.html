<h1>276 acl-2013-Part-of-Speech Induction in Dependency Trees for Statistical Machine Translation</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-276-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-1083.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Akihiro Tamura ; Taro Watanabe ; Eiichiro Sumita ; Hiroya Takamura ; Manabu Okumura</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a nonparametric Bayesian method for inducing Part-ofSpeech (POS) tags in dependency trees to improve the performance of statistical machine translation (SMT). In particular, we extend the monolingual infinite tree model (Finkel et al., 2007) to a bilingual scenario: each hidden state (POS tag) of a source-side dependency tree emits a source word together with its aligned target word, either jointly (joint model), or independently (independent model). Evaluations of Japanese-to-English translation on the NTCIR-9 data show that our induced Japanese POS tags for dependency trees improve the performance of a forest- to-string SMT system. Our independent model gains over 1 point in BLEU by resolving the sparseness problem introduced in the joint model.</p><br/>

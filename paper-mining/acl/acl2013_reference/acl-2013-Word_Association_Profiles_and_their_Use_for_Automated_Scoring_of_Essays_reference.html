<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-389-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-1113.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Beata Beigman Klebanov ; Michael Flor</p><p>Abstract: We describe a new representation of the content vocabulary of a text we call word association profile that captures the proportions of highly associated, mildly associated, unassociated, and dis-associated pairs of words that co-exist in the given text. We illustrate the shape of the distirbution and observe variation with genre and target audience. We present a study of the relationship between quality of writing and word association profiles. For a set of essays written by college graduates on a number of general topics, we show that the higher scoring essays tend to have higher percentages of both highly associated and dis-associated pairs, and lower percentages of mildly associated pairs of words. Finally, we use word association profiles to improve a system for automated scoring of essays.</p><br/>

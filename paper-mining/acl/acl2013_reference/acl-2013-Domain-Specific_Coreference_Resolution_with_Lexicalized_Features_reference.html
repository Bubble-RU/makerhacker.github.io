<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-130-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-2015.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Nathan Gilbert ; Ellen Riloff</p><p>Abstract: Most coreference resolvers rely heavily on string matching, syntactic properties, and semantic attributes of words, but they lack the ability to make decisions based on individual words. In this paper, we explore the benefits of lexicalized features in the setting of domain-specific coreference resolution. We show that adding lexicalized features to off-the-shelf coreference resolvers yields significant performance gains on four domain-specific data sets and with two types of coreference resolution architectures.</p><br/>

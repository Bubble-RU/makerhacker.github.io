<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-292-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-2076.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Anne-Laure Ligozat</p><p>Abstract: Question answering systems have been developed for many languages, but most resources were created for English, which can be a problem when developing a system in another language such as French. In particular, for question classification, no labeled question corpus is available for French, so this paper studies the possibility to use existing English corpora and transfer a classification by translating the question and their labels. By translating the training corpus, we obtain results close to a monolingual setting.</p><br/>

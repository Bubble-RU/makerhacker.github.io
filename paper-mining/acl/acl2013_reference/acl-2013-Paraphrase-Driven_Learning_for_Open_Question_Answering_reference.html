<h1>272 acl-2013-Paraphrase-Driven Learning for Open Question Answering</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-272-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-1158.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Anthony Fader ; Luke Zettlemoyer ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: We study question answering as a machine learning problem, and induce a function that maps open-domain questions to queries over a database of web extractions. Given a large, community-authored, question-paraphrase corpus, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn a semantic lexicon and linear ranking function without manually annotating questions. Our approach automatically generalizes a seed lexicon and includes a scalable, parallelized perceptron parameter estimation scheme. Experiments show that our approach more than quadruples the recall of the seed lexicon, with only an 8% loss in precision.</p><br/>

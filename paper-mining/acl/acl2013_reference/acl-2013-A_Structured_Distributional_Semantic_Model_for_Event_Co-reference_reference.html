<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-22-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-2083.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Kartik Goyal ; Sujay Kumar Jauhar ; Huiying Li ; Mrinmaya Sachan ; Shashank Srivastava ; Eduard Hovy</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to modelling distributional semantics that represents meaning as distributions over relations in syntactic neighborhoods. We argue that our model approximates meaning in compositional configurations more effectively than standard distributional vectors or bag-of-words models. We test our hypothesis on the problem of judging event coreferentiality, which involves compositional interactions in the predicate-argument structure of sentences, and demonstrate that our model outperforms both state-of-the-art window-based word embeddings as well as simple approaches to compositional semantics pre- viously employed in the literature.</p><br/>

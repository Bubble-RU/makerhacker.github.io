<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-331-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-1028.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: David Marecek ; Milan Straka</p><p>Abstract: Even though the quality of unsupervised dependency parsers grows, they often fail in recognition of very basic dependencies. In this paper, we exploit a prior knowledge of STOP-probabilities (whether a given word has any children in a given direction), which is obtained from a large raw corpus using the reducibility principle. By incorporating this knowledge into Dependency Model with Valence, we managed to considerably outperform the state-of-theart results in terms of average attachment score over 20 treebanks from CoNLL 2006 and 2007 shared tasks.</p><br/>

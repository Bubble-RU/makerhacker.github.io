<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-103-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-4006.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Georgiana Dinu ; Nghia The Pham ; Marco Baroni</p><p>Abstract: We introduce DISSECT, a toolkit to build and explore computational models of word, phrase and sentence meaning based on the principles of distributional semantics. The toolkit focuses in particular on compositional meaning, and implements a number of composition methods that have been proposed in the literature. Furthermore, DISSECT can be useful to researchers and practitioners who need models of word meaning (without composition) as well, as it supports various methods to construct distributional semantic spaces, assessing similarity and even evaluating against benchmarks, that are independent of the composition infrastructure.</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-88-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-3013.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Vlad Niculae ; Victoria Yaneva</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents work in progress towards automatic recognition and classification of comparisons and similes. Among possible applications, we discuss the place of this task in text simplification for readers with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), who are known to have deficits in comprehending figurative language. We propose an approach to comparison recognition through the use of syntactic patterns. Keeping in mind the requirements of autistic readers, we discuss the properties relevant for distinguishing semantic criteria like figurativeness and abstractness.</p><br/>

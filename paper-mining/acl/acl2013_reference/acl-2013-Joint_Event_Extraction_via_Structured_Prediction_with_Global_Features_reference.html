<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-206-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-1008.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Qi Li ; Heng Ji ; Liang Huang</p><p>Abstract: Traditional approaches to the task of ACE event extraction usually rely on sequential pipelines with multiple stages, which suffer from error propagation since event triggers and arguments are predicted in isolation by independent local classifiers. By contrast, we propose a joint framework based on structured prediction which extracts triggers and arguments together so that the local predictions can be mutually improved. In addition, we propose to incorporate global features which explicitly capture the dependencies of multiple triggers and arguments. Experimental results show that our joint approach with local features outperforms the pipelined baseline, and adding global features further improves the performance significantly. Our approach advances state-ofthe-art sentence-level event extraction, and even outperforms previous argument labeling methods which use external knowledge from other sentences and documents.</p><br/>

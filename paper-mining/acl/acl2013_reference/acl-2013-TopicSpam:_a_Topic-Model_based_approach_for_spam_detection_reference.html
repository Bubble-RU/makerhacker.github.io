<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-350-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-2039.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Jiwei Li ; Claire Cardie ; Sujian Li</p><p>Abstract: Product reviews are now widely used by individuals and organizations for decision making (Litvin et al., 2008; Jansen, 2010). And because of the profits at stake, people have been known to try to game the system by writing fake reviews to promote target products. As a result, the task of deceptive review detection has been gaining increasing attention. In this paper, we propose a generative LDA-based topic modeling approach for fake review detection. Our model can aptly detect the subtle dif- ferences between deceptive reviews and truthful ones and achieves about 95% accuracy on review spam datasets, outperforming existing baselines by a large margin.</p><br/>

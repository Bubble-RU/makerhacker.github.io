<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-254-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-2146.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Haifeng Hu ; Bingquan Liu ; Baoxun Wang ; Ming Liu ; Xiaolong Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem for predicting cQA answer quality as a classification task. We propose a multimodal deep belief nets based approach that operates in two stages: First, the joint representation is learned by taking both textual and non-textual features into a deep learning network. Then, the joint representation learned by the network is used as input features for a linear classifier. Extensive experimental results conducted on two cQA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p><br/>

<h1>176 acl-2013-Grounded Unsupervised Semantic Parsing</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-176-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-1092.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Hoifung Poon</p><p>Abstract: We present the first unsupervised approach for semantic parsing that rivals the accuracy of supervised approaches in translating natural-language questions to database queries. Our GUSP system produces a semantic parse by annotating the dependency-tree nodes and edges with latent states, and learns a probabilistic grammar using EM. To compensate for the lack of example annotations or question-answer pairs, GUSP adopts a novel grounded-learning approach to leverage database for indirect supervision. On the challenging ATIS dataset, GUSP attained an accuracy of 84%, effectively tying with the best published results by supervised approaches.</p><br/>

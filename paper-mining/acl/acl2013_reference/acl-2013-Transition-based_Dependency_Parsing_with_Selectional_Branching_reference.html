<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-358-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-1104.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Jinho D. Choi ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach, called selectional branching, which uses confidence estimates to decide when to employ a beam, providing the accuracy of beam search at speeds close to a greedy transition-based dependency parsing approach. Selectional branching is guaranteed to perform a fewer number of transitions than beam search yet performs as accurately. We also present a new transition-based dependency parsing algorithm that gives a complexity of O(n) for projective parsing and an expected linear time speed for non-projective parsing. With the standard setup, our parser shows an unlabeled attachment score of 92.96% and a parsing speed of 9 milliseconds per sentence, which is faster and more accurate than the current state-of-the-art transitionbased parser that uses beam search.</p><br/>

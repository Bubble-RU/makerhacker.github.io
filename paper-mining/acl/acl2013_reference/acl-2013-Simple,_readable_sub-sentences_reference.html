<h1>322 acl-2013-Simple, readable sub-sentences</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-322-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-3021.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Sigrid Klerke ; Anders Sgaard</p><p>Abstract: We present experiments using a new unsupervised approach to automatic text simplification, which builds on sampling and ranking via a loss function informed by readability research. The main idea is that a loss function can distinguish good simplification candidates among randomly sampled sub-sentences of the input sentence. Our approach is rated as equally grammatical and beginner reader appropriate as a supervised SMT-based baseline system by native speakers, but our setup performs more radical changes that better resembles the variation observed in human generated simplifications.</p><br/>

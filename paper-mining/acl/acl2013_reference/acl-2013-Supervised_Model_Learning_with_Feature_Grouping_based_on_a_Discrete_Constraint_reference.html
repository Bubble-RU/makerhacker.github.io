<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-334-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-2004.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Jun Suzuki ; Masaaki Nagata</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a framework of supervised model learning that realizes feature grouping to obtain lower complexity models. The main idea of our method is to integrate a discrete constraint into model learning with the help of the dual decomposition technique. Experiments on two well-studied NLP tasks, dependency parsing and NER, demonstrate that our method can provide state-of-the-art performance even if the degrees of freedom in trained models are surprisingly small, i.e., 8 or even 2. This significant benefit enables us to provide compact model representation, which is especially useful in actual use.</p><br/>

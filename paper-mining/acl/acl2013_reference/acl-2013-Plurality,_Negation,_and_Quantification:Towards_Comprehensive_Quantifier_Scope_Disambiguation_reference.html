<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-280-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-1007.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Mehdi Manshadi ; Daniel Gildea ; James Allen</p><p>Abstract: Recent work on statistical quantifier scope disambiguation (QSD) has improved upon earlier work by scoping an arbitrary number and type of noun phrases. No corpusbased method, however, has yet addressed QSD when incorporating the implicit universal of plurals and/or operators such as negation. In this paper we report early, though promising, results for automatic QSD when handling both phenomena. We also present a general model for learning to build partial orders from a set of pairwise preferences. We give an n log n algorithm for finding a guaranteed approximation of the optimal solution, which works very well in practice. Finally, we significantly improve the performance of the pre- vious model using a rich set of automatically generated features.</p><br/>

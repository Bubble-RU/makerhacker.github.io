<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-266-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-4012.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Yuanchao Liu ; Ming Liu ; Xiaolong Wang ; Limin Wang ; Jingjing Li</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose PAL, a prototype chatterbot for answering non-obstructive psychological domain-specific questions. This system focuses on providing primary suggestions or helping people relieve pressure by extracting knowledge from online forums, based on which the chatterbot system is constructed. The strategies used by PAL, including semantic-extension-based question matching, solution management with personal information consideration, and XML-based knowledge pattern construction, are described and discussed. We also conduct a primary test for the feasibility of our system.</p><br/>

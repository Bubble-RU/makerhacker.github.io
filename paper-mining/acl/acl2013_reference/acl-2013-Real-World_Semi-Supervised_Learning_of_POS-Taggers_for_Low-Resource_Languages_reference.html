<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-295-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-1057.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Dan Garrette ; Jason Mielens ; Jason Baldridge</p><p>Abstract: Developing natural language processing tools for low-resource languages often requires creating resources from scratch. While a variety of semi-supervised methods exist for training from incomplete data, there are open questions regarding what types of training data should be used and how much is necessary. We discuss a series of experiments designed to shed light on such questions in the context of part-of-speech tagging. We obtain timed annotations from linguists for the low-resource languages Kinyarwanda and Malagasy (as well as English) and eval- uate how the amounts of various kinds of data affect performance of a trained POS-tagger. Our results show that annotation of word types is the most important, provided a sufficiently capable semi-supervised learning infrastructure is in place to project type information onto a raw corpus. We also show that finitestate morphological analyzers are effective sources of type information when few labeled examples are available.</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-79-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-2085.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Eric T. Nalisnick ; Henry S. Baird</p><p>Abstract: We present an automatic method for analyzing sentiment dynamics between characters in plays. This literary format’s structured dialogue allows us to make assumptions about who is participating in a conversation. Once we have an idea of who a character is speaking to, the sentiment in his or her speech can be attributed accordingly, allowing us to generate lists of a character’s enemies and allies as well as pinpoint scenes critical to a character’s emotional development. Results of experiments on Shakespeare’s plays are presented along with discussion of how this work can be extended to unstructured texts (i.e. novels).</p><br/>

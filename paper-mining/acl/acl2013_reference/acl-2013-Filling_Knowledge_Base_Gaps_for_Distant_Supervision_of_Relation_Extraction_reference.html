<h1>159 acl-2013-Filling Knowledge Base Gaps for Distant Supervision of Relation Extraction</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-159-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-2117.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Wei Xu ; Raphael Hoffmann ; Le Zhao ; Ralph Grishman</p><p>Abstract: Distant supervision has attracted recent interest for training information extraction systems because it does not require any human annotation but rather employs existing knowledge bases to heuristically label a training corpus. However, previous work has failed to address the problem of false negative training examples mislabeled due to the incompleteness of knowledge bases. To tackle this problem, we propose a simple yet novel framework that combines a passage retrieval model using coarse features into a state-of-the-art relation extractor using multi-instance learning with fine features. We adapt the information retrieval technique of pseudo- relevance feedback to expand knowledge bases, assuming entity pairs in top-ranked passages are more likely to express a relation. Our proposed technique significantly improves the quality of distantly supervised relation extraction, boosting recall from 47.7% to 61.2% with a consistently high level of precision of around 93% in the experiments.</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-239-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-4011.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Pedro Fialho ; Luisa Coheur ; Sergio Curto ; Pedro Claudio ; Angela Costa ; Alberto Abad ; Hugo Meinedo ; Isabel Trancoso</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we describe a platform for embodied conversational agents with tutoring goals, which takes as input written and spoken questions and outputs answers in both forms. The platform is developed within a game environment, and currently allows speech recognition and synthesis in Portuguese, English and Spanish. In this paper we focus on its understanding component that supports in-domain interactions, and also small talk. Most indomain interactions are answered using different similarity metrics, which compare the perceived utterances with questions/sentences in the agent’s knowledge base; small-talk capabilities are mainly due to AIML, a language largely used by the chatbots’ community. In this paper we also introduce EDGAR, the butler of MONSERRATE, which was developed in the aforementioned platform, and that answers tourists’ questions about MONSERRATE.</p><br/>

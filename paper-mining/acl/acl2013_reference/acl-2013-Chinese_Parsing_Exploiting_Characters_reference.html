<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-80-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-1013.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Meishan Zhang ; Yue Zhang ; Wanxiang Che ; Ting Liu</p><p>Abstract: Characters play an important role in the Chinese language, yet computational processing of Chinese has been dominated by word-based approaches, with leaves in syntax trees being words. We investigate Chinese parsing from the character-level, extending the notion of phrase-structure trees by annotating internal structures of words. We demonstrate the importance of character-level information to Chinese processing by building a joint segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging and phrase-structure parsing system that integrates character-structure features. Our joint system significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art word-based baseline on the standard CTB5 test, and gives the best published results for Chinese parsing.</p><br/>

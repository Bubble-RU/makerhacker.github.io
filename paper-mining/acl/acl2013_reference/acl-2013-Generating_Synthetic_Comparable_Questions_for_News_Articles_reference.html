<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2013-169-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P13/P13-1073.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Oleg Rokhlenko ; Idan Szpektor</p><p>Abstract: We introduce the novel task of automatically generating questions that are relevant to a text but do not appear in it. One motivating example of its application is for increasing user engagement around news articles by suggesting relevant comparable questions, such as “is Beyonce a better singer than Madonna?”, for the user to answer. We present the first algorithm for the task, which consists of: (a) offline construction of a comparable question template database; (b) ranking of relevant templates to a given article; and (c) instantiation of templates only with entities in the article whose comparison under the template’s relation makes sense. We tested the suggestions generated by our algorithm via a Mechanical Turk experiment, which showed a significant improvement over the strongest baseline of more than 45% in all metrics.</p><br/>

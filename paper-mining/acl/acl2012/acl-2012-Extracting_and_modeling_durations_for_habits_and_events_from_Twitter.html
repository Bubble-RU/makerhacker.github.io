Twitter has become a central site where people express their opinions and views on political parties and candidates. Emerging events or news are often followed almost instantly by a burst in Twitter volume, providing a unique opportunity to gauge the relation between expressed public sentiment and electoral events. In addition, sentiment analysis can help explore how these events affect public opinion. While traditional content analysis takes days or weeks to complete, the system demonstrated here analyzes sentiment in the entire Twitter traffic about the election, delivering results instantly and continuously. It offers the public, the media, politicians and scholars a new and timely perspective on the dynamics of the electoral process and public opinion. 1</p><p>5 0.19674326 <a title="91-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Extracting_Narrative_Timelines_as_Temporal_Dependency_Structures.html">90 acl-2012-Extracting Narrative Timelines as Temporal Dependency Structures</a></p>
<p>Author: Oleksandr Kolomiyets ; Steven Bethard ; Marie-Francine Moens</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach to characterizing the timeline of a text: temporal dependency structures, where all the events of a narrative are linked via partial ordering relations like BEFORE, AFTER, OVERLAP and IDENTITY. We annotate a corpus of children’s stories with temporal dependency trees, achieving agreement (Krippendorff’s Alpha) of 0.856 on the event words, 0.822 on the links between events, and of 0.700 on the ordering relation labels. We compare two parsing models for temporal dependency structures, and show that a deterministic non-projective dependency parser outperforms a graph-based maximum spanning tree parser, achieving labeled attachment accuracy of 0.647 and labeled tree edit distance of 0.596. Our analysis of the dependency parser errors gives some insights into future research directions.</p><p>6 0.17924088 <a title="91-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Joint_Inference_of_Named_Entity_Recognition_and_Normalization_for_Tweets.html">124 acl-2012-Joint Inference of Named Entity Recognition and Normalization for Tweets</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiaohua Liu ; Ming Zhou ; Xiangyang Zhou ; Zhongyang Fu ; Furu Wei</p><p>Abstract: Tweets represent a critical source of fresh information, in which named entities occur frequently with rich variations. We study the problem of named entity normalization (NEN) for tweets. Two main challenges are the errors propagated from named entity recognition (NER) and the dearth of information in a single tweet. We propose a novel graphical model to simultaneously conduct NER and NEN on multiple tweets to address these challenges. Particularly, our model introduces a binary random variable for each pair of words with the same lemma across similar tweets, whose value indicates whether the two related words are mentions of the same entity. We evaluate our method on a manually annotated data set, and show that our method outperforms the baseline that handles these two tasks separately, boosting the F1 from 80.2% to 83.6% for NER, and the Accuracy from 79.4% to 82.6% for NEN, respectively.</p><p>5 0.61282009 <a title="91-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-A_System_for_Real-time_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_of_2012_U.S._Presidential_Election_Cycle.html">21 acl-2012-A System for Real-time Twitter Sentiment Analysis of 2012 U.S. Presidential Election Cycle</a></p>

<p>Author: Yafang Wang ; Maximilian Dylla ; Marc Spaniol ; Gerhard Weikum</p><p>Abstract: The Web and digitized text sources contain a wealth of information about named entities such as politicians, actors, companies, or cultural landmarks. Extracting this information has enabled the automated construction oflarge knowledge bases, containing hundred millions of binary relationships or attribute values about these named entities. However, in reality most knowledge is transient, i.e. changes over time, requiring a temporal dimension in fact extraction. In this paper we develop a methodology that combines label propagation with constraint reasoning for temporal fact extraction. Label propagation aggressively gathers fact candidates, and an Integer Linear Program is used to clean out false hypotheses that violate temporal constraints. Our method is able to improve on recall while keeping up with precision, which we demonstrate by experiments with biography-style Wikipedia pages and a large corpus of news articles.</p><p>3 0.50708711 <a title="91-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Semantic_Parsing_with_Bayesian_Tree_Transducers.html">174 acl-2012-Semantic Parsing with Bayesian Tree Transducers</a></p>
<p>Author: Bevan Jones ; Mark Johnson ; Sharon Goldwater</p><p>Abstract: Many semantic parsing models use tree transformations to map between natural language and meaning representation. However, while tree transformations are central to several state-of-the-art approaches, little use has been made of the rich literature on tree automata. This paper makes the connection concrete with a tree transducer based semantic parsing model and suggests that other models can be interpreted in a similar framework, increasing the generality of their contributions. In particular, this paper further introduces a variational Bayesian inference algorithm that is applicable to a wide class of tree transducers, producing state-of-the-art semantic parsing results while remaining applicable to any domain employing probabilistic tree transducers.</p><p>4 0.48705623 <a title="91-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Temporally_Anchored_Relation_Extraction.html">191 acl-2012-Temporally Anchored Relation Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Guillermo Garrido ; Anselmo Penas ; Bernardo Cabaleiro ; Alvaro Rodrigo</p><p>Abstract: Although much work on relation extraction has aimed at obtaining static facts, many of the target relations are actually fluents, as their validity is naturally anchored to a certain time period. This paper proposes a methodological approach to temporally anchored relation extraction. Our proposal performs distant supervised learning to extract a set of relations from a natural language corpus, and anchors each of them to an interval of temporal validity, aggregating evidence from documents supporting the relation. We use a rich graphbased document-level representation to generate novel features for this task. Results show that our implementation for temporal anchoring is able to achieve a 69% of the upper bound performance imposed by the relation extraction step. Compared to the state of the art, the overall system achieves the highest precision reported.</p><p>5 0.46182373 <a title="91-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Learning_to_Temporally_Order_Medical_Events_in_Clinical_Text.html">135 acl-2012-Learning to Temporally Order Medical Events in Clinical Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Preethi Raghavan ; Albert Lai ; Eric Fosler-Lussier</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of ordering medical events in unstructured clinical narratives by learning to rank them based on their time of occurrence. We represent each medical event as a time duration, with a corresponding start and stop, and learn to rank the starts/stops based on their proximity to the admission date. Such a representation allows us to learn all of Allen’s temporal relations between medical events. Interestingly, we observe that this methodology performs better than a classification-based approach for this domain, but worse on the relationships found in the Timebank corpus. This finding has important implications for styles of data representation and resources used for temporal relation learning: clinical narratives may have different language attributes corresponding to temporal ordering relative to Timebank, implying that the field may need to look at a wider range ofdomains to fully understand the nature of temporal ordering.</p><p>6 0.44014901 <a title="91-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Extracting_Narrative_Timelines_as_Temporal_Dependency_Structures.html">90 acl-2012-Extracting Narrative Timelines as Temporal Dependency Structures</a></p>

<p>Author: Limin Yao ; Sebastian Riedel ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: To discover relation types from text, most methods cluster shallow or syntactic patterns of relation mentions, but consider only one possible sense per pattern. In practice this assumption is often violated. In this paper we overcome this issue by inducing clusters of pattern senses from feature representations of patterns. In particular, we employ a topic model to partition entity pairs associated with patterns into sense clusters using local and global features. We merge these sense clusters into semantic relations using hierarchical agglomerative clustering. We compare against several baselines: a generative latent-variable model, a clustering method that does not disambiguate between path senses, and our own approach but with only local features. Experimental results show our proposed approach discovers dramatically more accurate clusters than models without sense disambiguation, and that incorporating global features, such as the document theme, is crucial.</p><p>3 0.18799761 <a title="18-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-A_Discriminative_Hierarchical_Model_for_Fast_Coreference_at_Large_Scale.html">10 acl-2012-A Discriminative Hierarchical Model for Fast Coreference at Large Scale</a></p>

These trees succinctly summarize the mentions providing a highly compact, information-rich structure for reasoning about entities and coreference uncertainty at massive scales.

<p>Author: Viet-An Nguyen ; Jordan Boyd-Graber ; Philip Resnik</p><p>Abstract: One of the key tasks for analyzing conversational data is segmenting it into coherent topic segments. However, most models of topic segmentation ignore the social aspect of conversations, focusing only on the words used. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian nonparametric model, Speaker Identity for Topic Segmentation (SITS), that discovers (1) the topics used in a conversation, (2) how these topics are shared across conversations, (3) when these topics shift, and (4) a person-specific tendency to introduce new topics. We evaluate against current unsupervised segmentation models to show that including personspecific information improves segmentation performance on meeting corpora and on political debates. Moreover, we provide evidence that SITS captures an individual’s tendency to introduce new topics in political contexts, via analysis of the 2008 US presidential debates and the television program Crossfire. 1 Topic Segmentation as a Social Process Conversation, interactive discussion between two or more people, is one of the most essential and common forms of communication. Whether in an informal situation or in more formal settings such as a political debate or business meeting, a conversation is often not about just one thing: topics evolve and are replaced as the conversation unfolds. Discovering this hidden structure in conversations is a key problem for conversational assistants (Tur et al., 2010) and tools that summarize (Murray et al., 2005) and display (Ehlen et al., 2007) conversational data. Topic segmentation also can illuminate individuals’ agendas (Boydstun et al., 2011), patterns of agree- ment and disagreement (Hawes et al., 2009; Abbott 78 Jordan Boyd-Graber iSchool and UMIACS University of Maryland College Park, MD jbg@ umiac s .umd .edu Philip Resnik Department of Linguistics and UMIACS University of Maryland College Park, MD re snik @ umd .edu al., 2011), and relationships among conversational participants (Ireland et al., 2011). One of the most natural ways to capture conversational structure is topic segmentation (Reynar, 1998; Purver, 2011). Topic segmentation approaches range from simple heuristic methods based on lexical similarity (Morris and Hirst, 1991 ; Hearst, 1997) to more intricate generative models and supervised methods (Georgescul et al., 2006; Purver et al., 2006; Gruber et al., 2007; Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008), which have been shown to outperform the established heuristics. However, previous computational work on conversational structure, particularly in topic discovery and topic segmentation, focuses primarily on conet tent, ignoring the speakers. We argue that, because conversation is a social process, we can understand conversational phenomena better by explicitly modeling behaviors of conversational participants. In Section 2, we incorporate participant identity in a new model we call Speaker Identity for Topic Segmentation (SITS), which discovers topical structure in conversation while jointly incorporating a participantlevel social component. Specifically, we explicitly model an individual’s tendency to introduce a topic. After outlining inference in Section 3 and introducing data in Section 4, we use SITS to improve state-ofthe-art-topic segmentation and topic identification models in Section 5. In addition, in Section 6, we also show that the per-speaker model is able to discover individuals who shape and influence the course of a conversation. Finally, we discuss related work and conclude the paper in Section 7. 2 Modeling Multiparty Discussions Data Properties We are interested in turn-taking, multiparty discussion. This is a broad category, inProce Jedijung, sR oefpu thbeli c50 othf K Aonrneua,a8l -M14e Jtiunlgy o 2f0 t1h2e.

More formally, such datasets contain C conversations. A conversation c has Tc turns, each of which is a maximal uninterrupted utterance by one speaker.1 In each turn t ∈ [1, Tc], a speaker ac,t utters N words {wc,t,n}. Eatch ∈ w [1o,rTd is from a vocabulary of size V , {awnd th}ere are M distinct speakers. Modeling Approaches The key insight of topic segmentation is that segments evince lexical cohesion (Galley et al., 2003; Olney and Cai, 2005). Words within a segment will look more like their neighbors than other words. This insight has been used to tune supervised methods (Hsueh et al., 2006) and inspire unsupervised models of lexical cohesion using bags of words (Purver et al., 2006) and language models (Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008). We too take the unsupervised statistical approach. It requires few resources and is applicable in many domains without extensive training. Like previous approaches, we consider each turn to be a bag of words generated from an admixture of topics. Topics—after the topic modeling literature (Blei and Lafferty, 2009)—are multinomial distributions over terms. These topics are part of a generative model posited to have produced a corpus. However, topic models alone cannot model the dynamics of a conversation. Topic models typically do not model the temporal dynamics of individual documents, and those that do (Wang et al., 2008; Gerrish and Blei, 2010) are designed for larger documents and are not applicable here because they assume that most topics appear in every time slice. Instead, we endow each turn with a binary latent variable lc,t, called the topic shift. This latent variable signifies whether the speaker changed the topic of the conversation. To capture the topic-controlling behavior of the speakers across different conversations, we further associate each speaker m with a latent topic shift tendency, πm. Informally, this variable is intended to capture the propensity of a speaker to effect a topic shift. Formally, it represents the probability that the speaker m will change the topic (distribution) of a conversation. We take a Bayesian nonparametric approach (M¨uller and Quintana, 2004). Unlike 1Note the distinction with phonetic definition are bounded by silence. utterances, which by 79 parametric models, which a priori fix the number of topics, nonparametric models use a flexible number of topics to better represent data. Nonparametric distributions such as the Dirichlet process (Ferguson, 1973) share statistical strength among conversations using a hierarchical model, such as the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) (Teh et al., 2006). 2.1 Generative Process In this section, we develop SITS, a generative model of multiparty discourse that jointly discovers topics and speaker-specific topic shifts from an unannotated corpus (Figure 1a). As in the hierarchical Dirichlet process (Teh et al., 2006), we allow an unbounded number of topics to be shared among the turns of the corpus. Topics are drawn from a base distribution H over multinomial distributions over the vocabulary, a finite Dirichlet with symmetric prior λ. Unlike the HDP, where every document (here, every turn) draws a new multinomial distribution from a Dirichlet process, the social and temporal dynamics of a conversation, as specified by the binary topic shift indicator lc,t, determine when new draws happen. The full generative process is as follows: 1. For speaker m ∈ [1, M], draw speaker shift probability πm ∼ Beta(γ) 2. Draw∼ global probability measure G0 ∼ DP(α, H) 3. For each conversation c ∈ [1, C] (a) Draw conversation distribution Gc ∼ DP(α0 , G0) (b) For each turn t ∈ [1, Tc] with speaker ac,t i. If t = 1, set the topic shift lc,t = 1. Otherwise, draw lc,t ∼ Bernoulli(πac,t ). ii. If lc,t = 1∼, d Breawrn Gc,t ∼ DP(αc, Gc). Otherwise, set Gc,t ≡ Gc,t−1 . iii. For each word ≡ind Gex n ∈ [1, Nc,t] • Draw ψc,t,n ∼ Gc,t • DDrraaww wc,t,n ∼ Multinomial(ψc,t,n) The hierarchy of Dirichlet processes allows statistical strength to be shared across contexts; within a conversation and across conversations. The perspeaker topic shift tendency πm allows speaker identity to influence the evolution of topics. To make notation concrete and aligned with the topic segmentation, we introduce notation for segments in a conversation. A segment s of conversation c is a sequence of turns [τ, τ0] such that lc,τ = lc,τ0+1 = 1and lc,t = 0, ∀t ∈ (τ, τ0] . When lc,t = 0, Gc,t is the same =Gc 0,t,−∀1t a ∈nd ( aτ,llτ τtopics (i.e. multinomial distributions over words) {ψc,t,n} that generate words in turn t and the topics{ ψ{ψc,t}−1,n} that generate words in turn t −1 come from{ψ ψthc,et −s1a,mn}e as Figure 1: Graphical model representations of our proposed models: (a) the nonparametric version; (b) the parametric version. Nodes represent random variables (shaded ones are observed), lines are probabilistic dependencies. Plates represent repetition. The innermost plates are turns, grouped in conversations. distribution. Thus all topics used in a segment s are drawn from a single distribution, Gc,s, , , , Gc,s | lc,1 lc,2 · · · lc,Tc , αc, Gc ∼ DP(αc, Gc) (1) For notational convenience, Sc denotes the number of segments in conversation c, and st denotes the segment index of turn t. We emphasize that all segment-related notations are derived from the posterior over the topic shifts land not part of the model itself. Parametric Version SITS is a generalization of a parametric model (Figure 1b) where each turn has a multinomial distribution over K topics. In the parametric case, the number of topics K is fixed. Each topic, as before, is a multinomial distribution φ1 . . . φK. In the parametric case, each turn t in conversation c has an explicit multinomial distribution over K topics θc,t, identical for turns within a segment. A new topic distribution θ is drawn from a Dirichlet distribution parameterized by α when the topic shift indicator lis 1. The parametric version does not share strength within or across conversations, unlike SITS. When applied on a single conversation without speaker identity (all speakers are identical) it is equivalent to (Purver et al., 2006). In our experiments (Section 5), we compare against both. 80 3 Inference To find the latent variables that best explain observed data, we use Gibbs sampling, a widely used Markov chain Monte Carlo inference technique (Neal, 2000; Resnik and Hardisty, 2010). The state space is latent variables for topic indices assigned to all tokens z = {zc,t,n} and topic shifts assigned to turns l= {lc,t}. {Wze marginalize over all other latent variablle =s. Here, we only present the conditional sampling equations; for more details, see our supplement.2 3.1 Sampling Topic Assignments To sample zc,t,n, the index of the shared topic assigned to token n of turn t in conversation c, we need to sample the path assigning each word token to a segment-specific topic, each segment-specific topic to a conversational topic and each conversational topic to a shared topic. For efficiency, we make use of the minimal path assumption (Wallach, 2008) to generate these assignments.3 Under the minimal path assumption, an observation is assumed to have been generated by using a new distribution if and only if there is no existing distribution with the same value. 2 http://www.cs.umd.edu/∼vietan/topicshift/appendix.pdf 3We also investigated using the maximal assumption and fully sampling assignments. We found the minimal path assumption worked as well as explicitly sampling seating assignments and that the maximal path assumption worked less well. We use Nc,s,k to denote the number of tokens in segment s in conversation c assigned topic k; Nc,k denotes the total number of segment-specific topics in conversation c assigned topic k and Nk denotes the number of conversational topics assigned topic k. TWk,w denotes the number of times the shared topic k is assigned to word w in the vocabulary. Marginal counts are represented with · and ∗ represents all hyperparameters. The condit·ional d∗istribution for zc,t,n is P(zc,t,n = k | wc,t,n = w, z−c,t,n, w−c,t,n, l, ∗) ∝ Nc−,sct ,kn+αNc −c,s−ct,kct·,n Nn+c −,·αc ,t0cnN +k−· αc,t0 ,n + αK ×  VT1 W k−, ·c,wctk, n e+w V.λ( 2), Here V is the size of the vocabulary, K is the current number of shared topics and the superscript −c,t,n denotes counts without considering wc,t,n. In Equation 2, the first factor is proportional to the probability of sampling a path according to the minimal path assumption; the second factor is proportional to the likelihood of observing w given the sampled topic. Since an uninformed prior is used, when a new topic is sampled, all tokens are equiprobable. 3.2 Sampling Topic Shifts Sampling the topic shift variable lc,t requires us to consider merging or splitting segments. We use kc,t to denote the shared topic indices of all tokens in turn t of conversation c; Sac,t,x to denote the number of times speaker ac,t is assigned the topic shift with value x ∈ {0, 1}; Jcx,s to denote the number of topics in segment s 1o}f conversation c if lc,t = x and Ncx,s,j to denote the number of tokens assigned to the segment-specific topic j when lc,t = x.4 Again, the superscript −c,t is used to denote exclusion of turn t of conversation c in the corresponding counts. Recall that the topic shift is a binary variable. We use 0 to represent the case that the topic distribution is identical to the previous turn. We sample this assignment P(lc,t = 0 | l−c,t, w, k, a, ∗) ∝ SSa−a−cc,c,ct,t , t·,0++ 2 γγ×αcJ0c,sNtx=Qc01,sjJt=c,0·,1s(tx(N −c0 1,s +t,j α−c) 1)!. (3) 4Deterministically knowQing the path assignments is the primary efficiency motivation for using the minimal path assumption. The alternative is to explicitly sample the path assignments, which is more complicated (for both notation and computation). This option is spelled in full detail in the supplementary material. 81 In Equation 3, the first factor is proportional to the probability of assigning a topic shift of value 0 to speaker ac,t and the second factor is proportional to the joint probability of all topics in segment st of conversation c when lc,t = 0. The other alternative is for the topic shift to be 1, which represents the introduction of a new distri- bution over topics inside an existing segment. We sample this as P(lc,t = 1 | l−c,t, w, k, a, ∗) ∝ S −a −c ,c t, t, t, ·1+ 2 γ ×αcJc1,(st−1x)NQ=c1,1(jJs=ct1−,1(s1t)−,·1()x(N −c1 1,( +st− α1c) ,j− 1)! αcJcQ1,sNxt=c1Q1,stJj,c=1·,(s1xt( −N 1c1, +stj α−c) 1)!. (4) As above, the first faQctor in Equation 4 is proportional to the probability of assigning a topic shift of value 1to speaker ac,t; the second factor in the big bracket is proportional to the joint distribution of the topics in segments st − 1 and st. In this case lc,t = 1 means splitting the current segment, which results in two joint probabilities for two segments. 4 Datasets This section introduces the three corpora we use. We preprocess the data to remove stopwords and remove turns containing fewer than five tokens. The ICSI Meeting Corpus: The ICSI Meeting Corpus (Janin et al., 2003) is 75 transcribed meetings. For evaluation, we used a standard set of reference segmentations (Galley et al., 2003) of 25 meetings. Segmentations are binary, i.e., each point of the document is either a segment boundary or not, and on average each meeting has 8 segment boundaries. After preprocessing, there are 60 unique speakers and the vocabulary contains 3346 non-stopword tokens. The 2008 Presidential Election Debates Our second dataset contains three annotated presidential debates (Boydstun et al., 2011) between Barack Obama and John McCain and a vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin. Each turn is one of two types: questions (Q) from the moderator or responses (R) from a candidate. Each clause in a turn is coded with a Question Topic (TQ) and a Response Topic (TR). Thus, a turn has a list of TQ’s and TR’s both of length equal to the number of clauses in the turn. Topics are from the Policy Agendas Topics SpeakerTypeTurn clausesTQTR BrokawQbSeenfo.r Oeib ta gmeat,s [b.e.t.t]er A arned yo thuey sa oyuingght [. to. b]e th parte tphaere Adm foerri tchaant? economy is going to get much worse1N/A ObamaR[hN.o .m,.]e Is B a,um mtac mokenofs itdu iermenpt o ahrabt oaun th tel yt ,h we c Aaen’rm epea gryoic ithnangei e trco bo hinlaosvm e[.y t. o. h]elp ordinary familes be able to stay in their1 1 4 BrokawQSen.

The topics (TQ and TR) are from the Policy Agendas Topics Codebook which contains the following codes of topic: Macroeconomics Community Development (14), Government Operations (20). (1), Housing & Codebook, a manual inventory of 19 major topics and 225 subtopics.5 Table 1 shows an example annotation. To get reference segmentations, we assign each turn a real value from 0 to 1indicating how much a turn changes the topic. For a question-typed turn, the score is the fraction of clause topics not appearing in the previous turn; for response-typed turns, the score is the fraction of clause topics that do not appear in the corresponding question. This results in a set of non-binary reference segmentations. For evaluation metrics that require binary segmentations, we create a binary segmentation by setting a turn as a segment boundary if the computed score is 1. This threshold is chosen to include only true segment boundaries. CNN’s Crossfire Crossfire was a weekly U.S. television “talking heads” program engineered to incite heated arguments (hence the name). Each episode features two recurring hosts, two guests, and clips from the week’s news. Our Crossfire dataset contains 1134 transcribed episodes aired between 2000 and 2004.6 There are 2567 unique speakers. Unlike the previous two datasets, Crossfire does not have explicit topic segmentations, so we use it to explore speaker-specific characteristics (Section 6). 5 Topic Segmentation Experiments In this section, we examine how well SITS can replicate annotations of when new topics are introduced. 5 http://www.policyagendas.org/page/topic-codebook 6 http://www.cs.umd.edu/∼vietan/topicshift/crossfire.zip 82 We discuss metrics for evaluating an algorithm’s segmentation against a gold annotation, describe our experimental setup, and report those results. Evaluation Metrics To evaluate segmentations, we use Pk (Beeferman et al., 1999) and WindowDiff (WD) (Pevzner and Hearst, 2002). Both metrics measure the probability that two points in a document will be incorrectly separated by a segment boundary. Both techniques consider all spans of length k in the document and count whether the two endpoints of the window are (im)properly segmented against the gold segmentation. However, these metrics have drawbacks. First, they require both hypothesized and reference segmentations to be binary. Many algorithms (e.g., probabilistic approaches) give non-binary segmentations where candidate boundaries have real-valued scores (e.g., probability or confidence). Thus, evaluation requires arbitrary thresholding to binarize soft scores. To be fair, thresholds are set so the number of segments are equal to a predefined value (Purver et al., 2006; Galley et al., 2003). To overcome these limitations, we also use Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) (Rubner et al., 2000), a metric that measures the distance between two distributions. The EMD is the minimal cost to transform one distribution into the other. Each segmentation can be considered a multi-dimensional distribution where each candidate boundary is a dimension. In EMD, a distance function across features allows partial credit for “near miss” segment boundaries. In addition, because EMD operates on distributions, we can compute the distance between non-binary hypothesized segmentations with binary or real-valued reference segmentations. We use the FastEMD implementation (Pele and Werman, 2009). Experimental Methods We applied the following methods to discover topic segmentations in a document: • TextTiling (Hearst, 1997) is one of the earliest generalpurpose topic segmentation algorithms, sliding a fixedwidth window to detect major changes in lexical similarity. • P-NoSpeaker-S: parametric version without speaker identity run on keaerc-hS conversation (Purver et al., 2006) • P-NoSpeaker-M: parametric version without speaker identity run on Mall conversations • P-SITS: the parametric version of SITS with speaker identity run on all conversations • NP-HMM: the HMM-based nonparametric model which a single topic per turn. This model can be considered a Sticky HDP-HMM (Fox et al., 2008) with speaker identity. • NP-SITS: the nonparametric version of SITS with speaker identity run on all conversations. Parameter Settings and Implementations experiment, all parameters same as in (Hearst, 1997). of TextTiling In our are the For statistical models, Gibbs sampling with 10 randomly initialized chains is used. Initial hyperparameter values are sampled from U(0, 1) to favor sparsity; statistics are collected after 500 burn-in iterations with a lag of 25 iterations over a total of 5000 iterations; and slice sampling (Neal, 2003) optimizes hyperparameters. Results and Analysis Table 2 shows the perfor- mance of various models on the topic segmentation problem, using the ICSI corpus and the 2008 debates. Consistent with previous results, probabilistic models outperform TextTiling. In addition, among the probabilistic models, the models that had access to speaker information consistently segment better than those lacking such information, supporting our assertion that there is benefit to modeling conversation as a social process. Furthermore, NP-SITS outperforms NP-HMM in both experiments, suggesting that using a distribution over topics to turns is better than using a single topic. This is consistent with parametric results reported in (Purver et al., 2006). The contribution of speaker identity seems more valuable in the debate setting. Debates are characterized by strong rewards for setting the agenda; dodging a question or moving the debate toward an oppo83 nent’s weakness can be useful strategies (Boydstun et al., 2011). In contrast, meetings (particularly lowstakes ICSI meetings) are characterized by pragmatic rather than strategic topic shifts. Second, agendasetting roles are clearer in formal debates; a modera- tor is tasked with setting the agenda and ensuring the conversation does not wander too much. The nonparametric model does best on the smaller debate dataset. We suspect that an evaluation that directly accessed the topic quality, either via prediction (Teh et al., 2006) or interpretability (Chang et al., 2009) would favor the nonparametric model more. 6 Evaluating Topic Shift Tendency In this section, we focus on the ability of SITS to capture speaker-level attributes. Recall that SITS associates with each speaker a topic shift tendency π that represents the probability of asserting a new topic in the conversation. While topic segmentation is a well studied problem, there are no established quantitative measurements of an individual’s ability to control a conversation. To evaluate whether the tendency is capturing meaningful characteristics of speakers, we compare our inferred tendencies against insights from political science. 2008 Elections To obtain a posterior estimate of π (Figure 3) we create 10 chains with hyperparameters sampled from the uniform distribution U(0, 1) and averaged π over 10 chains (as described in Section 5). In these debates, Ifill is the moderator of the debate between Biden and Palin; Brokaw, Lehrer and Schieffer are the three moderators of three debates between Obama and McCain. Here “Question” denotes questions from audiences in “town hall” debate. The role of this “speaker” can be considered equivalent to the debate moderator. The topic shift tendencies of moderators are much higher than for candidates. In the three debates between Obama and McCain, the moderators— Brokaw, Lehrer and Schieffer—have significantly higher scores than both candidates. This is a useful reality check, since in a debate the moderators are the ones asking questions and literally controlling the topical focus. Interestingly, in the vice-presidential debate, the score of moderator Ifill is only slightly higher than those of Palin and Biden; this is consistent with media commentary characterizing her as a size of the metrics Pk and WindowDiff chosen to replicate previous results. weak moderator.7 Similarly, the “Question” speaker had a relatively high variance, consistent with an amalgamation of many distinct speakers. These topic shift tendencies suggest that all candidates manage to succeed at some points in setting and controlling the debate topics. Our model gives Obama a slightly higher score than McCain, consistent with social science claims (Boydstun et al., 2011) that Obama had the lead in setting the agenda over McCain. Table 4 shows of SITS-detected topic shifts. Crossfire Crossfire, unlike the debates, has many speakers. This allows us to examine more closely what we can learn about speakers’ topic shift tendency. We verified that SITS can segment topics, and assuming that changing the topic is useful for a speaker, how can we characterize who does so effectively? We examine the relationship between topic shift tendency, social roles, and political ideology. To focus on frequent speakers, we filter out speakers with fewer than 30 turns. Most speakers have relatively small π, with the mode around 0.3. There are, however, speakers with very high topic shift tendencies. Table 5 shows the speakers having the highest values according to SITS. We find that there are three general patterns for who influences the course of a conversation in Crossfire. First, there are structural “speakers” the show uses to frame and propose new topics. These are 7 http://harpers.org/archive/2008/10/hbc-90003659 84 2008 Presidential Election Debates (larger means greater tendency) audience questions, news clips (e.g. many of Gore’s and Bush’s turns from 2000), and voice overs. That SITS is able to recover these is reassuring. Second, the stable of regular hosts receives high topic shift tendencies, which is reasonable given their experience with the format and ostensible moderation roles (in practice they also stoke lively discussion). The remaining class is more interesting. The remaining non-hosts with high topic shift tendency are relative moderates on the political spectrum: • John Kasich, one of few Republicans to support the assault weapons ban and now governor of Ohio, a swing state • Christine Todd Whitman, former Republican governor of CNehrwis Jersey, a very iDtmemano,c froartmice srt Ratee • John McCain, who before 2008 was known as a “maverick” for working with Democrats (e.g. Russ Feingold) This suggests that, despite Crossfire’s tendency to create highly partisan debates, those who are able to work across the political spectrum may best be able to influence the topic under discussion in highly polarized contexts. Table 4 shows detected topic shifts from these speakers; two of these examples (McCain and Whitman) show disagreement of Republicans with President Bush. In the other, Kasich is defending a Republican plan (school vouchers) popular with traditional Democratic constituencies. 7 Related and Future Work In the realm of statistical models, a number of techniques incorporate social connections and identity to explain content in social networks (Chang and Blei, atsbDePMmwphIncFiAoasCrtuLleycnNdAg:irIs’SatYphyo,weumckItGrasy’.qoheivfnuIakgrsdt?heo vna,dtbpJ.omslrheyivcaBnwdspeur[.ihodqtef]nuar,slihmetdnyuaopi’s-SbeI[hBn.FCtDvHLcr]ligEemIhysNoa:nFbvWidxeAltEsghnmRboad:eics[yr.,fmtuwleinha][go.,dLYftweur]–’lhsdaitngxerkbIfoat.hqeslkOufinrmbtyoeha,rit[n.geholyasc]rdi,wteoaxylpm’sburneItaopfkvicsqr.,n[BYoOtafebxruli.,mcEksGgatvn]roOebpyitmlnorcd.ea[sfviPYtr]lgoandyu., Previous turnTurn detected as shifting topic examples of those with high topic shift tendency 238947156FPAGNQMreouna.mlvsWea†‡kt.iluBonrcseh‡.7586 41702 4863150FBCKWMealchgrsitCvA lamuhoin†efr.5 2473509 π.

Apart from those groups, speakers with the highest tendency were political moderates. 2009) and scientific corpora (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004). However, these models ignore the temporal evolution of content, treating documents as static. Models that do investigate the evolution of topics over time typically ignore the identify of the speaker. For example: models having sticky topics over ngrams (Johnson, 2010), sticky HDP-HMM (Fox et al., 2008); models that are an amalgam of sequential models and topic models (Griffiths et al., 2005; Wal85 lach, 2006; Gruber et al., 2007; Ahmed and Xing, 2008; Boyd-Graber and Blei, 2008; Du et al., 2010); or explicit models of time or other relevant features as a distinct latent variable (Wang and McCallum, 2006; Eisenstein et al., 2010). In contrast, SITS jointly models topic and individuals’ tendency to control a conversation. Not only does SITS outperform other models using standard computational linguistics baselines, but it also pro- poses intriguing hypotheses for social scientists. Associating each speaker with a scalar that models their tendency to change the topic does improve performance on standard tasks, but it’s inadequate to fully describe an individual. Modeling individuals’ perspective (Paul and Girju, 2010), “side” (Thomas et al., 2006), or personal preferences for topics (Grimmer, 2009) would enrich the model and better illuminate the interaction of influence and topic. Statistical analysis of political discourse can help discover patterns that political scientists, who often work via a “close reading,” might otherwise miss. We plan to work with social scientists to validate our implicit hypothesis that our topic shift tendency correlates well with intuitive measures of “influence.” Acknowledgements This research was funded in part by the Army Research Laboratory through ARL Cooperative Agreement W91 1NF-09-2-0072 and by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), through the Army Research Laboratory.

<p>Author: Wei Lu ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel sequence labeling model based on the latent-variable semiMarkov conditional random fields for jointly extracting argument roles of events from texts. The model takes in coarse mention and type information and predicts argument roles for a given event template. This paper addresses the event extraction problem in a primarily unsupervised setting, where no labeled training instances are available. Our key contribution is a novel learning framework called structured preference modeling (PM), that allows arbitrary preference to be assigned to certain structures during the learning procedure. We establish and discuss connections between this framework and other existing works. We show empirically that the structured preferences are crucial to the success of our task. Our model, trained without annotated data and with a small number of structured preferences, yields performance competitive to some baseline supervised approaches.</p><p>6 0.12694046 <a title="18-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Discriminative_Learning_for_Joint_Template_Filling.html">73 acl-2012-Discriminative Learning for Joint Template Filling</a></p>

<p>Author: Dani Yogatama ; Yanchuan Sim ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We present a statistical model for canonicalizing named entity mentions into a table whose rows represent entities and whose columns are attributes (or parts of attributes). The model is novel in that it incorporates entity context, surface features, firstorder dependencies among attribute-parts, and a notion of noise. Transductive learning from a few seeds and a collection of mention tokens combines Bayesian inference and conditional estimation. We evaluate our model and its components on two datasets collected from political blogs and sports news, finding that it outperforms a simple agglomerative clustering approach and previous work.</p><p>2 0.84367019 <a title="18-lsi-2" href="./acl-2012-A_Discriminative_Hierarchical_Model_for_Fast_Coreference_at_Large_Scale.html">10 acl-2012-A Discriminative Hierarchical Model for Fast Coreference at Large Scale</a></p>

However, they suffer from a number of drawbacks including difficulties scaling to large numbers of mentions and limited representational power. As these drawbacks become increasingly restrictive, the need to replace the pairwise approaches with a more expressive, highly scalable alternative is becoming urgent. In this paper we propose a novel discriminative hierarchical model that recursively partitions entities into trees of latent sub-entities. These trees succinctly summarize the mentions providing a highly compact, information-rich structure for reasoning about entities and coreference uncertainty at massive scales. We demonstrate that the hierarchical model is several orders of magnitude faster than pairwise, allowing us to perform coreference on six million author mentions in under four hours on a single CPU.</p><p>3 0.73554713 <a title="18-lsi-3" href="./acl-2012-Coreference_Semantics_from_Web_Features.html">58 acl-2012-Coreference Semantics from Web Features</a></p>

Specifically, we exploit short-distance cues to hypernymy, semantic compatibility, and semantic context, as well as general lexical co-occurrence. When added to a state-of-the-art coreference baseline, our Web features give significant gains on multiple datasets (ACE 2004 and ACE 2005) and metrics (MUC and B3), resulting in the best results reported to date for the end-to-end task of coreference resolution.</p><p>4 0.61520356 <a title="18-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-Collective_Classification_for_Fine-grained_Information_Status.html">50 acl-2012-Collective Classification for Fine-grained Information Status</a></p>
<p>Author: Katja Markert ; Yufang Hou ; Michael Strube</p><p>Abstract: Previous work on classifying information status (Nissim, 2006; Rahman and Ng, 2011) is restricted to coarse-grained classification and focuses on conversational dialogue. We here introduce the task of classifying finegrained information status and work on written text. We add a fine-grained information status layer to the Wall Street Journal portion of the OntoNotes corpus. We claim that the information status of a mention depends not only on the mention itself but also on other mentions in the vicinity and solve the task by collectively classifying the information status ofall mentions. Our approach strongly outperforms reimplementations of previous work.</p><p>5 0.60572028 <a title="18-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-Unsupervised_Relation_Discovery_with_Sense_Disambiguation.html">208 acl-2012-Unsupervised Relation Discovery with Sense Disambiguation</a></p>
<p>Author: Limin Yao ; Sebastian Riedel ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: To discover relation types from text, most methods cluster shallow or syntactic patterns of relation mentions, but consider only one possible sense per pattern. In practice this assumption is often violated. In this paper we overcome this issue by inducing clusters of pattern senses from feature representations of patterns. In particular, we employ a topic model to partition entity pairs associated with patterns into sense clusters using local and global features. We merge these sense clusters into semantic relations using hierarchical agglomerative clustering. We compare against several baselines: a generative latent-variable model, a clustering method that does not disambiguate between path senses, and our own approach but with only local features. Experimental results show our proposed approach discovers dramatically more accurate clusters than models without sense disambiguation, and that incorporating global features, such as the document theme, is crucial.</p><p>6 0.56544137 <a title="18-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-Discriminative_Learning_for_Joint_Template_Filling.html">73 acl-2012-Discriminative Learning for Joint Template Filling</a></p>

<p>Author: Andrea Gesmundo ; Giorgio Satta ; James Henderson</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel heuristic algorithm for Cube Pruning running in linear time in the beam size. Empirically, we show a gain in running time of a standard machine translation system, at a small loss in accuracy.</p><p>2 0.81346041 <a title="18-lda-2" href="./acl-2012-Qualitative_Modeling_of_Spatial_Prepositions_and_Motion_Expressions.html">166 acl-2012-Qualitative Modeling of Spatial Prepositions and Motion Expressions</a></p>

<p>Author: Dani Yogatama ; Yanchuan Sim ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We present a statistical model for canonicalizing named entity mentions into a table whose rows represent entities and whose columns are attributes (or parts of attributes). The model is novel in that it incorporates entity context, surface features, firstorder dependencies among attribute-parts, and a notion of noise. Transductive learning from a few seeds and a collection of mention tokens combines Bayesian inference and conditional estimation. We evaluate our model and its components on two datasets collected from political blogs and sports news, finding that it outperforms a simple agglomerative clustering approach and previous work.</p><p>4 0.6546461 <a title="18-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-The_Creation_of_a_Corpus_of_English_Metalanguage.html">195 acl-2012-The Creation of a Corpus of English Metalanguage</a></p>
<p>Author: Shomir Wilson</p><p>Abstract: Metalanguage is an essential linguistic mechanism which allows us to communicate explicit information about language itself. However, it has been underexamined in research in language technologies, to the detriment of the performance of systems that could exploit it. This paper describes the creation of the first tagged and delineated corpus of English metalanguage, accompanied by an explicit definition and a rubric for identifying the phenomenon in text. This resource will provide a basis for further studies of metalanguage and enable its utilization in language technologies.</p><p>5 0.6539852 <a title="18-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Multilingual_Named_Entity_Recognition_using_Parallel_Data_and_Metadata_from_Wikipedia.html">150 acl-2012-Multilingual Named Entity Recognition using Parallel Data and Metadata from Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>Author: Sungchul Kim ; Kristina Toutanova ; Hwanjo Yu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a method to automatically label multi-lingual data with named entity tags. We build on prior work utilizing Wikipedia metadata and show how to effectively combine the weak annotations stemming from Wikipedia metadata with information obtained through English-foreign language parallel Wikipedia sentences. The combination is achieved using a novel semi-CRF model for foreign sentence tagging in the context of a parallel English sentence. The model outperforms both standard annotation projection methods and methods based solely on Wikipedia metadata.</p><p>6 0.6415754 <a title="18-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Automatic_Event_Extraction_with_Structured_Preference_Modeling.html">33 acl-2012-Automatic Event Extraction with Structured Preference Modeling</a></p>

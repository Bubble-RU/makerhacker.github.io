<p>Author: Hao Tang ; Joseph Keshet ; Karen Livescu</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of learning the mapping between words and their possible pronunciations in terms of sub-word units. Most previous approaches have involved generative modeling of the distribution of pronunciations, usually trained to maximize likelihood. We propose a discriminative, feature-rich approach using large-margin learning. This approach allows us to optimize an objective closely related to a discriminative task, to incorporate a large number of complex features, and still do inference efficiently. We test the approach on the task of lexical access; that is, the prediction of a word given a phonetic transcription. In experiments on a subset of the Switchboard conversational speech corpus, our models thus far improve classification error rates from a previously published result of 29.1% to about 15%. We find that large-margin approaches outperform conditional random field learning, and that the Passive-Aggressive algorithm for largemargin learning is faster to converge than the Pegasos algorithm.</p><p>3 0.23193054 <a title="41-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-A_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Approach_to_Acoustic_Model_Discovery.html">16 acl-2012-A Nonparametric Bayesian Approach to Acoustic Model Discovery</a></p>
<p>Author: Chia-ying Lee ; James Glass</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of acoustic modeling in which prior language-specific knowledge and transcribed data are unavailable. We present an unsupervised model that simultaneously segments the speech, discovers a proper set of sub-word units (e.g., phones) and learns a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for each induced acoustic unit. Our approach is formulated as a Dirichlet process mixture model in which each mixture is an HMM that represents a sub-word unit. We apply our model to the TIMIT corpus, and the results demonstrate that our model discovers sub-word units that are highly correlated with English phones and also produces better segmentation than the state-of-the-art unsupervised baseline. We test the quality of the learned acoustic models on a spoken term detection task. Compared to the baselines, our model improves the relative precision of top hits by at least 22.1% and outper- forms a language-mismatched acoustic model.</p><p>4 0.17369848 <a title="41-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Semantic_Parsing_with_Bayesian_Tree_Transducers.html">174 acl-2012-Semantic Parsing with Bayesian Tree Transducers</a></p>
<p>Author: Bevan Jones ; Mark Johnson ; Sharon Goldwater</p><p>Abstract: Many semantic parsing models use tree transformations to map between natural language and meaning representation. However, while tree transformations are central to several state-of-the-art approaches, little use has been made of the rich literature on tree automata. This paper makes the connection concrete with a tree transducer based semantic parsing model and suggests that other models can be interpreted in a similar framework, increasing the generality of their contributions. In particular, this paper further introduces a variational Bayesian inference algorithm that is applicable to a wide class of tree transducers, producing state-of-the-art semantic parsing results while remaining applicable to any domain employing probabilistic tree transducers.</p><p>5 0.16197641 <a title="41-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-A_Computational_Approach_to_the_Automation_of_Creative_Naming.html">7 acl-2012-A Computational Approach to the Automation of Creative Naming</a></p>

<p>Author: Khe Chai Sim</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic framework that combines multiple knowledge sources for Haptic Voice Recognition (HVR), a multimodal input method designed to provide efficient text entry on modern mobile devices. HVR extends the conventional voice input by allowing users to provide complementary partial lexical information via touch input to improve the efficiency and accuracy of voice recognition. This paper investigates the use of the initial letter of the words in the utterance as the partial lexical information. In addition to the acoustic and language models used in automatic speech recognition systems, HVR uses the haptic and partial lexical models as additional knowledge sources to reduce the recognition search space and suppress confusions. Experimental results show that both the word error rate and runtime factor can be re- duced by a factor of two using HVR.</p><p>5 0.59338492 <a title="41-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-A_Computational_Approach_to_the_Automation_of_Creative_Naming.html">7 acl-2012-A Computational Approach to the Automation of Creative Naming</a></p>

<p>Author: Geoffrey Zweig ; John C. Platt ; Christopher Meek ; Christopher J.C. Burges ; Ainur Yessenalina ; Qiang Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of sentencelevel semantic coherence by answering SATstyle sentence completion questions. These questions test the ability of algorithms to distinguish sense from nonsense based on a variety of sentence-level phenomena. We tackle the problem with two approaches: methods that use local lexical information, such as the n-grams of a classical language model; and methods that evaluate global coherence, such as latent semantic analysis. We evaluate these methods on a suite of practice SAT questions, and on a recently released sentence completion task based on data taken from five Conan Doyle novels. We find that by fusing local and global information, we can exceed 50% on this task (chance baseline is 20%), and we suggest some avenues for further research.</p><p>3 0.75412542 <a title="41-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-The_Creation_of_a_Corpus_of_English_Metalanguage.html">195 acl-2012-The Creation of a Corpus of English Metalanguage</a></p>
<p>Author: Shomir Wilson</p><p>Abstract: Metalanguage is an essential linguistic mechanism which allows us to communicate explicit information about language itself. However, it has been underexamined in research in language technologies, to the detriment of the performance of systems that could exploit it. This paper describes the creation of the first tagged and delineated corpus of English metalanguage, accompanied by an explicit definition and a rubric for identifying the phenomenon in text. This resource will provide a basis for further studies of metalanguage and enable its utilization in language technologies.</p><p>4 0.74584287 <a title="41-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Social_Event_Radar%3A_A_Bilingual_Context_Mining_and_Sentiment_Analysis_Summarization_System.html">180 acl-2012-Social Event Radar: A Bilingual Context Mining and Sentiment Analysis Summarization System</a></p>
<p>Author: Wen-Tai Hsieh ; Chen-Ming Wu ; Tsun Ku ; Seng-cho T. Chou</p><p>Abstract: Social Event Radar is a new social networking-based service platform, that aim to alert as well as monitor any merchandise flaws, food-safety related issues, unexpected eruption of diseases or campaign issues towards to the Government, enterprises of any kind or election parties, through keyword expansion detection module, using bilingual sentiment opinion analysis tool kit to conclude the specific event social dashboard and deliver the outcome helping authorities to plan “risk control” strategy. With the rapid development of social network, people can now easily publish their opinions on the Internet. On the other hand, people can also obtain various opinions from others in a few seconds even though they do not know each other. A typical approach to obtain required information is to use a search engine with some relevant keywords. We thus take the social media and forum as our major data source and aim at collecting specific issues efficiently and effectively in this work. 163 Chen-Ming Wu Institute for Information Industry cmwu@ i i i .org .tw Seng-cho T.

<p>Author: Hao Wang ; Dogan Can ; Abe Kazemzadeh ; Francois Bar ; Shrikanth Narayanan</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a system for real-time analysis of public sentiment toward presidential candidates in the 2012 U.S. election as expressed on Twitter, a microblogging service. Twitter has become a central site where people express their opinions and views on political parties and candidates. Emerging events or news are often followed almost instantly by a burst in Twitter volume, providing a unique opportunity to gauge the relation between expressed public sentiment and electoral events. In addition, sentiment analysis can help explore how these events affect public opinion. While traditional content analysis takes days or weeks to complete, the system demonstrated here analyzes sentiment in the entire Twitter traffic about the election, delivering results instantly and continuously. It offers the public, the media, politicians and scholars a new and timely perspective on the dynamics of the electoral process and public opinion. 1</p><p>6 0.74393284 <a title="41-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Exploiting_Social_Information_in_Grounded_Language_Learning_via_Grammatical_Reduction.html">88 acl-2012-Exploiting Social Information in Grounded Language Learning via Grammatical Reduction</a></p>

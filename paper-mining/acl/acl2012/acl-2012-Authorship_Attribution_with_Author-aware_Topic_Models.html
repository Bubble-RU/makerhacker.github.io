[sent-4, score-0.617]
</p><p>3 In addition, we define a model that combines LDA and AT by representing authors and documents over two disjoint topic sets, and show that our model outperforms LDA, AT and support vector machines on datasets with many authors. [sent-5, score-0.461]
</p><p>4 1 Introduction Authorship attribution (AA) has attracted much attention due to its many applications in, e. [sent-6, score-0.141]
</p><p>5 The  traditional problem, which is the focus of our work, is to attribute test texts of unknown authorship to one of a set of known authors, whose training texts are supplied in advance (i. [sent-9, score-0.479]
</p><p>6 While most of the early work on AA focused on formal texts with only a few possible authors, researchers have recently turned their attention to informal texts and tens to thousands of authors (Koppel et al. [sent-12, score-0.324]
</p><p>7 In parallel, topic models have gained popularity as a means of analysing such large text corpora (Blei, 2012). [sent-14, score-0.219]
</p><p>8 , 2011), we showed that methods based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) a popular topic model –  264 by Blei et al. [sent-16, score-0.219]
</p><p>9 However, LDA does not model authors explicitly, and we are not aware of any previous studies that apply author-aware topic models to traditional AA. [sent-18, score-0.321]
</p><p>10 We show that DADT outperforms AT, LDA, and linear support vector machines on AA with many authors. [sent-22, score-0.029]
</p><p>11 Our definition of DADT is motivated by the observation that when authors write texts on the same issue, specific words must be used (e. [sent-24, score-0.213]
</p><p>12 , texts about LDA are likely to contain the words “topic” and “prior”), while other words vary in frequency according to author style. [sent-26, score-0.309]
</p><p>13 Also, texts by the same author share similar style markers, independently of content (Koppel et al. [sent-27, score-0.309]
</p><p>14 DADT aims to separate document words from author words by generating them from two disjoint topic sets of document topics and author topics. [sent-29, score-0.989]
</p><p>15 (2009) (among others) also used disjoint topic sets to represent document labels, and Chemudugunta et al. [sent-32, score-0.414]
</p><p>16 The closest work we know of is by Mimno and McCallum (2008), whose DMR model outperformed AT in AA  T(A)  T(D)  ProceedJienjgus, R ofep thueb 5lic0t hof A Knonrueaa,l M 8-e1e4ti Jnugly o f2 t0h1e2 A. [sent-35, score-0.057]

</p><p>23 , AT trained with an additional unique “fictitious” author for each document, allowing it to adapt to individual documents and not only to authors). [sent-96, score-0.198]
</p><p>24 First, in DADT author topics are disjoint from document topics, with different priors for each topic set. [sent-98, score-0.751]
</p><p>25 Thus, the number of author topics can be different from the number of document topics, enabling us to vary the number of author topics according to the number of authors in the corpus. [sent-99, score-0.772]
</p><p>26 Second, DADT places different priors on the word distributions for author topics and document topics and respectively). [sent-100, score-0.516]
</p><p>27 Stopwords are known to be strong indicators of authorship (Koppel et al. [sent-101, score-0.257]
</p><p>28 We found that specifying a prior belief that about 80% of each document is composed of author words yielded better results than using AT’s approach, which evenly splits each document into author and document words. [sent-103, score-0.778]
</p><p>29 This allows us to consider the number of texts by each author when performing AA. [sent-105, score-0.309]
</p><p>30 Authorship Attribution Methods  We experimented with the following AA methods, using token frequency features, which are good predictors of authorship (Koppel et al. [sent-108, score-0.257]
</p><p>31 This approach uses the Hellinger distances of topic distributions to assign test texts to the closest author. [sent-116, score-0.376]
</p><p>32 , 2011), we experimented with two variants: (1) each author’s texts are concatenated before building the LDA model; and (2) no concatenation is performed. [sent-118, score-0.111]
</p><p>33 Note that when dealing with single-authored texts, concatenating each author’s texts yields an LDA model that is equivalent to AT. [sent-121, score-0.111]
</p><p>34 , 2004), we calculate the probability of the test text words for each author a, assuming it was written by a, and return the most probable author. [sent-124, score-0.22]
</p><p>35 We do not  know of any other studies that used AT in this manner for single-authored AA. [sent-125, score-0.025]
</p><p>36 Same as AT, but built with an additional unique “fictitious” author for each document. [sent-128, score-0.198]
</p><p>37 Given our DADT model, we assume that the test text was written by a “new” author, and infer this author’s topic distribution, the author/document topic ratio, and the document topic distribution. [sent-130, score-0.741]
</p><p>38 We then calculate the probability of each author given the model’s parameters, the test text words, and the inferred author/document topic ratio and document topic distribution. [sent-131, score-0.756]
</p><p>39 We use this method to avoid inferring the document-dependent parameters separately for each author, which is infeasible when many authors exist. [sent-133, score-0.124]
</p><p>40 A version that marginalises over these parameters will be explored in future work. [sent-134, score-0.022]
</p><p>41 4  Evaluation  We compare the performance of the methods on two publicly-available datasets: (1) PAN’11: emails with 72 authors (Argamon and Juola, 2011); and (2) Blog: blogs with 19,320 authors (Schler et  266 al. [sent-135, score-0.204]
</p><p>42 These datasets represent realistic scenarios of AA of user-generated texts with many candidate authors. [sent-137, score-0.111]
</p><p>43 For example, Chaski (2005) notes a case where an employee who was terminated for sending a racist email claimed that any person with access to his computer could have sent the email. [sent-138, score-0.036]
</p><p>44 Experiments on the PAN’ 11 dataset followed the setup of the PAN’ 11 competition (Argamon and Juola, 2011): We trained all the methods on the given training subset, tuned the parameters according to the results on the given validation subset, and ran the tuned methods on the given testing subset. [sent-140, score-0.1]
</p><p>45 In the Blog experiments, we used tenfold cross validation as in (Seroussi et al. [sent-141, score-0.035]
</p><p>46 We used collapsed Gibbs sampling to train all the topic models (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004), running 4 chains with a burn-in of 1,000 iterations. [sent-143, score-0.219]
</p><p>47 In the PAN’ 11 experiments, we retained 8 samples per chain with spacing of 100 iterations. [sent-144, score-0.041]
</p><p>48 In the Blog experiments, we retained 1 sample per chain due to runtime constraints. [sent-145, score-0.041]
</p><p>49 Since we cannot average topic distribution estimates obtained from training sam-  ples due to topic exchangeability (Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007), we averaged the distances and probabilities calculated from the retained samples. [sent-146, score-0.554]
</p><p>50 For test text sampling, we used a burn-in of 100 iterations and averaged the parameter estimates over the next 100 iterations in a similar manner to Rosen-Zvi et al. [sent-147, score-0.052]
</p><p>51 We found that these settings yield stable results across different random seed values. [sent-149, score-0.026]
</p><p>52 We found that the number of topics has a larger impact on accuracy than other configurable parameters. [sent-150, score-0.117]
</p><p>53 Hence, we used symmetric topic priors, setting all the elements of and  α(D) α(A) to min{0. [sent-151, score-0.219]
</p><p>54 01 }f rore epaecchword w as the base measure for the prior of words in topics. [sent-156, score-0.029]
</p><p>55 Since DADT allows us to encode our prior knowledge that stopword use is indicative of author-  βw(D)  βw(A)  +  ship, we set = 0. [sent-157, score-0.063]

</p><p>59 In addition, we set ηa = 1for each author a, yielding smoothed estimates for the corpus distribution of authors χ. [sent-202, score-0.352]
</p><p>60 To fairly compare the topic-based methods, we used the same overall number of topics for all the topic models. [sent-203, score-0.314]
</p><p>61 We present only the results obtained with the best topic settings: 100 for PAN’ 11and 400 for Blog, with DADT’s author/document topic splits being 90/10 for PAN’ 11, and 390/10 for Blog. [sent-204, score-0.474]
</p><p>62 These splits allow DADT to de-noise the author represen-  ±  tations by allocating document words to a relatively small number of document topics. [sent-205, score-0.402]
</p><p>63 It is worth noting that AT can be seen as an extreme version of DADT, where all the topics are author topics. [sent-206, score-0.293]
</p><p>64 A future extension is to learn the topic balance automatically, e. [sent-207, score-0.219]

</p><p>68 The PAN’ 11 results are shown for the validation and testing subsets, and the Blog results are shown for a subset containing the 1,000 most prolific authors and for the full dataset of 19,320 authors. [sent-215, score-0.175]
</p><p>69 Our DADT model yielded the best results in all cases (the differences between DADT and the other methods are statistically significant according to a paired two-tailed t-test with p < 0. [sent-216, score-0.028]
</p><p>70 We attribute DADT’s superior performance to the de-noising effect of the disjoint topic sets, which appear to yield author representations of higher predictive quality than those of the other models. [sent-218, score-0.554]
</p><p>71 On the other hand, AT-FA performed much worse than all the other methods on PAN’ 11, prob-  ably because of the inherent noisiness in using the 267 same topics to model both authors and documents. [sent-220, score-0.197]
</p><p>72 DADT’s PAN’ 11 testing result is close to the third-best accuracy from the PAN’ 11 competition (Argamon and Juola, 2011). [sent-222, score-0.065]
</p><p>73 However, to the best of our knowledge, DADT obtained the best accuracy for a fully-supervised method that uses only unigram features. [sent-223, score-0.022]
</p><p>74 Specifically, Kourtis and Stamatatos (201 1), who obtained the highest accuracy (65. [sent-224, score-0.022]
</p><p>75 8%), assumed that all the test texts are given to the classifier at the same time, and used this additional information with a semi-supervised method; while Kern et al. [sent-225, score-0.111]
</p><p>76 While all the methods yielded relatively low accuracies on Blog due to its size, topic-based methods were more strongly affected than SVM by the transition from the 1,000 author subset to the full dataset. [sent-234, score-0.226]
</p><p>77 Notably, an oracle that chooses the correct answer between SVM and DADT when they disagree yields an accuracy of 37. [sent-236, score-0.022]
</p><p>78 15% on the full dataset, suggesting it is worthwhile to explore ensembles that combine the outputs of SVM and DADT (we tried using DADT topics as additional SVM features, but this did not outperform DADT). [sent-237, score-0.095]
</p><p>79 5  Conclusion  This paper demonstrated the utility of using authoraware topic models for AA: AT outperformed LDA, and our DADT model outperformed LDA, AT and SVMs in cases with noisy texts and many authors. [sent-238, score-0.398]
</p><p>80 We hope that these results will inspire further research into the application of topic models to AA. [sent-239, score-0.219]

We associate each synchronous rule with a topic distribution, and select desirable rules according to the similarity of their topic distributions with given documents.

<p>Author: Viet-An Nguyen ; Jordan Boyd-Graber ; Philip Resnik</p><p>Abstract: One of the key tasks for analyzing conversational data is segmenting it into coherent topic segments. However, most models of topic segmentation ignore the social aspect of conversations, focusing only on the words used. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian nonparametric model, Speaker Identity for Topic Segmentation (SITS), that discovers (1) the topics used in a conversation, (2) how these topics are shared across conversations, (3) when these topics shift, and (4) a person-specific tendency to introduce new topics. We evaluate against current unsupervised segmentation models to show that including personspecific information improves segmentation performance on meeting corpora and on political debates. Moreover, we provide evidence that SITS captures an individual’s tendency to introduce new topics in political contexts, via analysis of the 2008 US presidential debates and the television program Crossfire. 1 Topic Segmentation as a Social Process Conversation, interactive discussion between two or more people, is one of the most essential and common forms of communication. Whether in an informal situation or in more formal settings such as a political debate or business meeting, a conversation is often not about just one thing: topics evolve and are replaced as the conversation unfolds. Discovering this hidden structure in conversations is a key problem for conversational assistants (Tur et al., 2010) and tools that summarize (Murray et al., 2005) and display (Ehlen et al., 2007) conversational data. Topic segmentation also can illuminate individuals’ agendas (Boydstun et al., 2011), patterns of agree- ment and disagreement (Hawes et al., 2009; Abbott 78 Jordan Boyd-Graber iSchool and UMIACS University of Maryland College Park, MD jbg@ umiac s .umd .edu Philip Resnik Department of Linguistics and UMIACS University of Maryland College Park, MD re snik @ umd .edu al., 2011), and relationships among conversational participants (Ireland et al., 2011). One of the most natural ways to capture conversational structure is topic segmentation (Reynar, 1998; Purver, 2011). Topic segmentation approaches range from simple heuristic methods based on lexical similarity (Morris and Hirst, 1991 ; Hearst, 1997) to more intricate generative models and supervised methods (Georgescul et al., 2006; Purver et al., 2006; Gruber et al., 2007; Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008), which have been shown to outperform the established heuristics. However, previous computational work on conversational structure, particularly in topic discovery and topic segmentation, focuses primarily on conet tent, ignoring the speakers. We argue that, because conversation is a social process, we can understand conversational phenomena better by explicitly modeling behaviors of conversational participants. In Section 2, we incorporate participant identity in a new model we call Speaker Identity for Topic Segmentation (SITS), which discovers topical structure in conversation while jointly incorporating a participantlevel social component. Specifically, we explicitly model an individual’s tendency to introduce a topic. After outlining inference in Section 3 and introducing data in Section 4, we use SITS to improve state-ofthe-art-topic segmentation and topic identification models in Section 5. In addition, in Section 6, we also show that the per-speaker model is able to discover individuals who shape and influence the course of a conversation. Finally, we discuss related work and conclude the paper in Section 7. 2 Modeling Multiparty Discussions Data Properties We are interested in turn-taking, multiparty discussion.

Modeling Approaches The key insight of topic segmentation is that segments evince lexical cohesion (Galley et al., 2003; Olney and Cai, 2005). Words within a segment will look more like their neighbors than other words. This insight has been used to tune supervised methods (Hsueh et al., 2006) and inspire unsupervised models of lexical cohesion using bags of words (Purver et al., 2006) and language models (Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008). We too take the unsupervised statistical approach. It requires few resources and is applicable in many domains without extensive training. Like previous approaches, we consider each turn to be a bag of words generated from an admixture of topics. Topics—after the topic modeling literature (Blei and Lafferty, 2009)—are multinomial distributions over terms. These topics are part of a generative model posited to have produced a corpus. However, topic models alone cannot model the dynamics of a conversation. Topic models typically do not model the temporal dynamics of individual documents, and those that do (Wang et al., 2008; Gerrish and Blei, 2010) are designed for larger documents and are not applicable here because they assume that most topics appear in every time slice. Instead, we endow each turn with a binary latent variable lc,t, called the topic shift. This latent variable signifies whether the speaker changed the topic of the conversation. To capture the topic-controlling behavior of the speakers across different conversations, we further associate each speaker m with a latent topic shift tendency, πm. Informally, this variable is intended to capture the propensity of a speaker to effect a topic shift. Formally, it represents the probability that the speaker m will change the topic (distribution) of a conversation. We take a Bayesian nonparametric approach (M¨uller and Quintana, 2004). Unlike 1Note the distinction with phonetic definition are bounded by silence. utterances, which by 79 parametric models, which a priori fix the number of topics, nonparametric models use a flexible number of topics to better represent data. Nonparametric distributions such as the Dirichlet process (Ferguson, 1973) share statistical strength among conversations using a hierarchical model, such as the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) (Teh et al., 2006). 2.1 Generative Process In this section, we develop SITS, a generative model of multiparty discourse that jointly discovers topics and speaker-specific topic shifts from an unannotated corpus (Figure 1a). As in the hierarchical Dirichlet process (Teh et al., 2006), we allow an unbounded number of topics to be shared among the turns of the corpus. Topics are drawn from a base distribution H over multinomial distributions over the vocabulary, a finite Dirichlet with symmetric prior λ. Unlike the HDP, where every document (here, every turn) draws a new multinomial distribution from a Dirichlet process, the social and temporal dynamics of a conversation, as specified by the binary topic shift indicator lc,t, determine when new draws happen. The full generative process is as follows: 1. For speaker m ∈ [1, M], draw speaker shift probability πm ∼ Beta(γ) 2. Draw∼ global probability measure G0 ∼ DP(α, H) 3. For each conversation c ∈ [1, C] (a) Draw conversation distribution Gc ∼ DP(α0 , G0) (b) For each turn t ∈ [1, Tc] with speaker ac,t i. If t = 1, set the topic shift lc,t = 1. Otherwise, draw lc,t ∼ Bernoulli(πac,t ). ii. If lc,t = 1∼, d Breawrn Gc,t ∼ DP(αc, Gc). Otherwise, set Gc,t ≡ Gc,t−1 . iii. For each word ≡ind Gex n ∈ [1, Nc,t] • Draw ψc,t,n ∼ Gc,t • DDrraaww wc,t,n ∼ Multinomial(ψc,t,n) The hierarchy of Dirichlet processes allows statistical strength to be shared across contexts; within a conversation and across conversations. The perspeaker topic shift tendency πm allows speaker identity to influence the evolution of topics. To make notation concrete and aligned with the topic segmentation, we introduce notation for segments in a conversation. A segment s of conversation c is a sequence of turns [τ, τ0] such that lc,τ = lc,τ0+1 = 1and lc,t = 0, ∀t ∈ (τ, τ0] . When lc,t = 0, Gc,t is the same =Gc 0,t,−∀1t a ∈nd ( aτ,llτ τtopics (i.e. multinomial distributions over words) {ψc,t,n} that generate words in turn t and the topics{ ψ{ψc,t}−1,n} that generate words in turn t −1 come from{ψ ψthc,et −s1a,mn}e as Figure 1: Graphical model representations of our proposed models: (a) the nonparametric version; (b) the parametric version. Nodes represent random variables (shaded ones are observed), lines are probabilistic dependencies. Plates represent repetition. The innermost plates are turns, grouped in conversations. distribution. Thus all topics used in a segment s are drawn from a single distribution, Gc,s, , , , Gc,s | lc,1 lc,2 · · · lc,Tc , αc, Gc ∼ DP(αc, Gc) (1) For notational convenience, Sc denotes the number of segments in conversation c, and st denotes the segment index of turn t. We emphasize that all segment-related notations are derived from the posterior over the topic shifts land not part of the model itself. Parametric Version SITS is a generalization of a parametric model (Figure 1b) where each turn has a multinomial distribution over K topics. In the parametric case, the number of topics K is fixed. Each topic, as before, is a multinomial distribution φ1 . . . φK. In the parametric case, each turn t in conversation c has an explicit multinomial distribution over K topics θc,t, identical for turns within a segment. A new topic distribution θ is drawn from a Dirichlet distribution parameterized by α when the topic shift indicator lis 1. The parametric version does not share strength within or across conversations, unlike SITS. When applied on a single conversation without speaker identity (all speakers are identical) it is equivalent to (Purver et al., 2006). In our experiments (Section 5), we compare against both. 80 3 Inference To find the latent variables that best explain observed data, we use Gibbs sampling, a widely used Markov chain Monte Carlo inference technique (Neal, 2000; Resnik and Hardisty, 2010). The state space is latent variables for topic indices assigned to all tokens z = {zc,t,n} and topic shifts assigned to turns l= {lc,t}. {Wze marginalize over all other latent variablle =s. Here, we only present the conditional sampling equations; for more details, see our supplement.2 3.1 Sampling Topic Assignments To sample zc,t,n, the index of the shared topic assigned to token n of turn t in conversation c, we need to sample the path assigning each word token to a segment-specific topic, each segment-specific topic to a conversational topic and each conversational topic to a shared topic. For efficiency, we make use of the minimal path assumption (Wallach, 2008) to generate these assignments.3 Under the minimal path assumption, an observation is assumed to have been generated by using a new distribution if and only if there is no existing distribution with the same value. 2 http://www.cs.umd.edu/∼vietan/topicshift/appendix.pdf 3We also investigated using the maximal assumption and fully sampling assignments. We found the minimal path assumption worked as well as explicitly sampling seating assignments and that the maximal path assumption worked less well. We use Nc,s,k to denote the number of tokens in segment s in conversation c assigned topic k; Nc,k denotes the total number of segment-specific topics in conversation c assigned topic k and Nk denotes the number of conversational topics assigned topic k. TWk,w denotes the number of times the shared topic k is assigned to word w in the vocabulary. Marginal counts are represented with · and ∗ represents all hyperparameters. The condit·ional d∗istribution for zc,t,n is P(zc,t,n = k | wc,t,n = w, z−c,t,n, w−c,t,n, l, ∗) ∝ Nc−,sct ,kn+αNc −c,s−ct,kct·,n Nn+c −,·αc ,t0cnN +k−· αc,t0 ,n + αK ×  VT1 W k−, ·c,wctk, n e+w V.λ( 2), Here V is the size of the vocabulary, K is the current number of shared topics and the superscript −c,t,n denotes counts without considering wc,t,n. In Equation 2, the first factor is proportional to the probability of sampling a path according to the minimal path assumption; the second factor is proportional to the likelihood of observing w given the sampled topic. Since an uninformed prior is used, when a new topic is sampled, all tokens are equiprobable. 3.2 Sampling Topic Shifts Sampling the topic shift variable lc,t requires us to consider merging or splitting segments. We use kc,t to denote the shared topic indices of all tokens in turn t of conversation c; Sac,t,x to denote the number of times speaker ac,t is assigned the topic shift with value x ∈ {0, 1}; Jcx,s to denote the number of topics in segment s 1o}f conversation c if lc,t = x and Ncx,s,j to denote the number of tokens assigned to the segment-specific topic j when lc,t = x.4 Again, the superscript −c,t is used to denote exclusion of turn t of conversation c in the corresponding counts. Recall that the topic shift is a binary variable. We use 0 to represent the case that the topic distribution is identical to the previous turn. We sample this assignment P(lc,t = 0 | l−c,t, w, k, a, ∗) ∝ SSa−a−cc,c,ct,t , t·,0++ 2 γγ×αcJ0c,sNtx=Qc01,sjJt=c,0·,1s(tx(N −c0 1,s +t,j α−c) 1)!. (3) 4Deterministically knowQing the path assignments is the primary efficiency motivation for using the minimal path assumption. The alternative is to explicitly sample the path assignments, which is more complicated (for both notation and computation). This option is spelled in full detail in the supplementary material. 81 In Equation 3, the first factor is proportional to the probability of assigning a topic shift of value 0 to speaker ac,t and the second factor is proportional to the joint probability of all topics in segment st of conversation c when lc,t = 0. The other alternative is for the topic shift to be 1, which represents the introduction of a new distri- bution over topics inside an existing segment. We sample this as P(lc,t = 1 | l−c,t, w, k, a, ∗) ∝ S −a −c ,c t, t, t, ·1+ 2 γ ×αcJc1,(st−1x)NQ=c1,1(jJs=ct1−,1(s1t)−,·1()x(N −c1 1,( +st− α1c) ,j− 1)! αcJcQ1,sNxt=c1Q1,stJj,c=1·,(s1xt( −N 1c1, +stj α−c) 1)!. (4) As above, the first faQctor in Equation 4 is proportional to the probability of assigning a topic shift of value 1to speaker ac,t; the second factor in the big bracket is proportional to the joint distribution of the topics in segments st − 1 and st. In this case lc,t = 1 means splitting the current segment, which results in two joint probabilities for two segments. 4 Datasets This section introduces the three corpora we use. We preprocess the data to remove stopwords and remove turns containing fewer than five tokens. The ICSI Meeting Corpus: The ICSI Meeting Corpus (Janin et al., 2003) is 75 transcribed meetings. For evaluation, we used a standard set of reference segmentations (Galley et al., 2003) of 25 meetings. Segmentations are binary, i.e., each point of the document is either a segment boundary or not, and on average each meeting has 8 segment boundaries. After preprocessing, there are 60 unique speakers and the vocabulary contains 3346 non-stopword tokens. The 2008 Presidential Election Debates Our second dataset contains three annotated presidential debates (Boydstun et al., 2011) between Barack Obama and John McCain and a vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin. Each turn is one of two types: questions (Q) from the moderator or responses (R) from a candidate. Each clause in a turn is coded with a Question Topic (TQ) and a Response Topic (TR). Thus, a turn has a list of TQ’s and TR’s both of length equal to the number of clauses in the turn. Topics are from the Policy Agendas Topics SpeakerTypeTurn clausesTQTR BrokawQbSeenfo.r Oeib ta gmeat,s [b.e.t.t]er A arned yo thuey sa oyuingght [. to. b]e th parte tphaere Adm foerri tchaant? economy is going to get much worse1N/A ObamaR[hN.o .m,.]e Is B a,um mtac mokenofs itdu iermenpt o ahrabt oaun th tel yt ,h we c Aaen’rm epea gryoic ithnangei e trco bo hinlaosvm e[.y t. o. h]elp ordinary familes be able to stay in their1 1 4 BrokawQSen.

The topics (TQ and TR) are from the Policy Agendas Topics Codebook which contains the following codes of topic: Macroeconomics Community Development (14), Government Operations (20). (1), Housing & Codebook, a manual inventory of 19 major topics and 225 subtopics.5 Table 1 shows an example annotation. To get reference segmentations, we assign each turn a real value from 0 to 1indicating how much a turn changes the topic. For a question-typed turn, the score is the fraction of clause topics not appearing in the previous turn; for response-typed turns, the score is the fraction of clause topics that do not appear in the corresponding question. This results in a set of non-binary reference segmentations. For evaluation metrics that require binary segmentations, we create a binary segmentation by setting a turn as a segment boundary if the computed score is 1. This threshold is chosen to include only true segment boundaries. CNN’s Crossfire Crossfire was a weekly U.S. television “talking heads” program engineered to incite heated arguments (hence the name). Each episode features two recurring hosts, two guests, and clips from the week’s news. Our Crossfire dataset contains 1134 transcribed episodes aired between 2000 and 2004.6 There are 2567 unique speakers. Unlike the previous two datasets, Crossfire does not have explicit topic segmentations, so we use it to explore speaker-specific characteristics (Section 6). 5 Topic Segmentation Experiments In this section, we examine how well SITS can replicate annotations of when new topics are introduced. 5 http://www.policyagendas.org/page/topic-codebook 6 http://www.cs.umd.edu/∼vietan/topicshift/crossfire.zip 82 We discuss metrics for evaluating an algorithm’s segmentation against a gold annotation, describe our experimental setup, and report those results. Evaluation Metrics To evaluate segmentations, we use Pk (Beeferman et al., 1999) and WindowDiff (WD) (Pevzner and Hearst, 2002). Both metrics measure the probability that two points in a document will be incorrectly separated by a segment boundary. Both techniques consider all spans of length k in the document and count whether the two endpoints of the window are (im)properly segmented against the gold segmentation. However, these metrics have drawbacks. First, they require both hypothesized and reference segmentations to be binary. Many algorithms (e.g., probabilistic approaches) give non-binary segmentations where candidate boundaries have real-valued scores (e.g., probability or confidence). Thus, evaluation requires arbitrary thresholding to binarize soft scores. To be fair, thresholds are set so the number of segments are equal to a predefined value (Purver et al., 2006; Galley et al., 2003). To overcome these limitations, we also use Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) (Rubner et al., 2000), a metric that measures the distance between two distributions. The EMD is the minimal cost to transform one distribution into the other. Each segmentation can be considered a multi-dimensional distribution where each candidate boundary is a dimension. In EMD, a distance function across features allows partial credit for “near miss” segment boundaries. In addition, because EMD operates on distributions, we can compute the distance between non-binary hypothesized segmentations with binary or real-valued reference segmentations. We use the FastEMD implementation (Pele and Werman, 2009). Experimental Methods We applied the following methods to discover topic segmentations in a document: • TextTiling (Hearst, 1997) is one of the earliest generalpurpose topic segmentation algorithms, sliding a fixedwidth window to detect major changes in lexical similarity. • P-NoSpeaker-S: parametric version without speaker identity run on keaerc-hS conversation (Purver et al., 2006) • P-NoSpeaker-M: parametric version without speaker identity run on Mall conversations • P-SITS: the parametric version of SITS with speaker identity run on all conversations • NP-HMM: the HMM-based nonparametric model which a single topic per turn. This model can be considered a Sticky HDP-HMM (Fox et al., 2008) with speaker identity. • NP-SITS: the nonparametric version of SITS with speaker identity run on all conversations. Parameter Settings and Implementations experiment, all parameters same as in (Hearst, 1997). of TextTiling In our are the For statistical models, Gibbs sampling with 10 randomly initialized chains is used. Initial hyperparameter values are sampled from U(0, 1) to favor sparsity; statistics are collected after 500 burn-in iterations with a lag of 25 iterations over a total of 5000 iterations; and slice sampling (Neal, 2003) optimizes hyperparameters. Results and Analysis Table 2 shows the perfor- mance of various models on the topic segmentation problem, using the ICSI corpus and the 2008 debates. Consistent with previous results, probabilistic models outperform TextTiling. In addition, among the probabilistic models, the models that had access to speaker information consistently segment better than those lacking such information, supporting our assertion that there is benefit to modeling conversation as a social process. Furthermore, NP-SITS outperforms NP-HMM in both experiments, suggesting that using a distribution over topics to turns is better than using a single topic. This is consistent with parametric results reported in (Purver et al., 2006). The contribution of speaker identity seems more valuable in the debate setting. Debates are characterized by strong rewards for setting the agenda; dodging a question or moving the debate toward an oppo83 nent’s weakness can be useful strategies (Boydstun et al., 2011). In contrast, meetings (particularly lowstakes ICSI meetings) are characterized by pragmatic rather than strategic topic shifts. Second, agendasetting roles are clearer in formal debates; a modera- tor is tasked with setting the agenda and ensuring the conversation does not wander too much. The nonparametric model does best on the smaller debate dataset. We suspect that an evaluation that directly accessed the topic quality, either via prediction (Teh et al., 2006) or interpretability (Chang et al., 2009) would favor the nonparametric model more. 6 Evaluating Topic Shift Tendency In this section, we focus on the ability of SITS to capture speaker-level attributes. Recall that SITS associates with each speaker a topic shift tendency π that represents the probability of asserting a new topic in the conversation. While topic segmentation is a well studied problem, there are no established quantitative measurements of an individual’s ability to control a conversation. To evaluate whether the tendency is capturing meaningful characteristics of speakers, we compare our inferred tendencies against insights from political science. 2008 Elections To obtain a posterior estimate of π (Figure 3) we create 10 chains with hyperparameters sampled from the uniform distribution U(0, 1) and averaged π over 10 chains (as described in Section 5). In these debates, Ifill is the moderator of the debate between Biden and Palin; Brokaw, Lehrer and Schieffer are the three moderators of three debates between Obama and McCain. Here “Question” denotes questions from audiences in “town hall” debate. The role of this “speaker” can be considered equivalent to the debate moderator. The topic shift tendencies of moderators are much higher than for candidates. In the three debates between Obama and McCain, the moderators— Brokaw, Lehrer and Schieffer—have significantly higher scores than both candidates. This is a useful reality check, since in a debate the moderators are the ones asking questions and literally controlling the topical focus. Interestingly, in the vice-presidential debate, the score of moderator Ifill is only slightly higher than those of Palin and Biden; this is consistent with media commentary characterizing her as a size of the metrics Pk and WindowDiff chosen to replicate previous results. weak moderator.7 Similarly, the “Question” speaker had a relatively high variance, consistent with an amalgamation of many distinct speakers. These topic shift tendencies suggest that all candidates manage to succeed at some points in setting and controlling the debate topics. Our model gives Obama a slightly higher score than McCain, consistent with social science claims (Boydstun et al., 2011) that Obama had the lead in setting the agenda over McCain. Table 4 shows of SITS-detected topic shifts. Crossfire Crossfire, unlike the debates, has many speakers. This allows us to examine more closely what we can learn about speakers’ topic shift tendency. We verified that SITS can segment topics, and assuming that changing the topic is useful for a speaker, how can we characterize who does so effectively? We examine the relationship between topic shift tendency, social roles, and political ideology. To focus on frequent speakers, we filter out speakers with fewer than 30 turns. Most speakers have relatively small π, with the mode around 0.3. There are, however, speakers with very high topic shift tendencies. Table 5 shows the speakers having the highest values according to SITS. We find that there are three general patterns for who influences the course of a conversation in Crossfire. First, there are structural “speakers” the show uses to frame and propose new topics. These are 7 http://harpers.org/archive/2008/10/hbc-90003659 84 2008 Presidential Election Debates (larger means greater tendency) audience questions, news clips (e.g. many of Gore’s and Bush’s turns from 2000), and voice overs. That SITS is able to recover these is reassuring. Second, the stable of regular hosts receives high topic shift tendencies, which is reasonable given their experience with the format and ostensible moderation roles (in practice they also stoke lively discussion). The remaining class is more interesting. The remaining non-hosts with high topic shift tendency are relative moderates on the political spectrum: • John Kasich, one of few Republicans to support the assault weapons ban and now governor of Ohio, a swing state • Christine Todd Whitman, former Republican governor of CNehrwis Jersey, a very iDtmemano,c froartmice srt Ratee • John McCain, who before 2008 was known as a “maverick” for working with Democrats (e.g. Russ Feingold) This suggests that, despite Crossfire’s tendency to create highly partisan debates, those who are able to work across the political spectrum may best be able to influence the topic under discussion in highly polarized contexts. Table 4 shows detected topic shifts from these speakers; two of these examples (McCain and Whitman) show disagreement of Republicans with President Bush. In the other, Kasich is defending a Republican plan (school vouchers) popular with traditional Democratic constituencies. 7 Related and Future Work In the realm of statistical models, a number of techniques incorporate social connections and identity to explain content in social networks (Chang and Blei, atsbDePMmwphIncFiAoasCrtuLleycnNdAg:irIs’SatYphyo,weumckItGrasy’.qoheivfnuIakgrsdt?heo vna,dtbpJ.omslrheyivcaBnwdspeur[.ihodqtef]nuar,slihmetdnyuaopi’s-SbeI[hBn.FCtDvHLcr]ligEemIhysNoa:nFbvWidxeAltEsghnmRboad:eics[yr.,fmtuwleinha][go.,dLYftweur]–’lhsdaitngxerkbIfoat.hqeslkOufinrmbtyoeha,rit[n.geholyasc]rdi,wteoaxylpm’sburneItaopfkvicsqr.,n[BYoOtafebxruli.,mcEksGgatvn]roOebpyitmlnorcd.ea[sfviPYtr]lgoandyu., Previous turnTurn detected as shifting topic examples of those with high topic shift tendency 238947156FPAGNQMreouna.mlvsWea†‡kt.iluBonrcseh‡.7586 41702 4863150FBCKWMealchgrsitCvA lamuhoin†efr.5 2473509 π.

Apart from those groups, speakers with the highest tendency were political moderates. 2009) and scientific corpora (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004). However, these models ignore the temporal evolution of content, treating documents as static. Models that do investigate the evolution of topics over time typically ignore the identify of the speaker. For example: models having sticky topics over ngrams (Johnson, 2010), sticky HDP-HMM (Fox et al., 2008); models that are an amalgam of sequential models and topic models (Griffiths et al., 2005; Wal85 lach, 2006; Gruber et al., 2007; Ahmed and Xing, 2008; Boyd-Graber and Blei, 2008; Du et al., 2010); or explicit models of time or other relevant features as a distinct latent variable (Wang and McCallum, 2006; Eisenstein et al., 2010). In contrast, SITS jointly models topic and individuals’ tendency to control a conversation. Not only does SITS outperform other models using standard computational linguistics baselines, but it also pro- poses intriguing hypotheses for social scientists. Associating each speaker with a scalar that models their tendency to change the topic does improve performance on standard tasks, but it’s inadequate to fully describe an individual. Modeling individuals’ perspective (Paul and Girju, 2010), “side” (Thomas et al., 2006), or personal preferences for topics (Grimmer, 2009) would enrich the model and better illuminate the interaction of influence and topic. Statistical analysis of political discourse can help discover patterns that political scientists, who often work via a “close reading,” might otherwise miss. We plan to work with social scientists to validate our implicit hypothesis that our topic shift tendency correlates well with intuitive measures of “influence.” Acknowledgements This research was funded in part by the Army Research Laboratory through ARL Cooperative Agreement W91 1NF-09-2-0072 and by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), through the Army Research Laboratory.

<p>Author: Yuening Hu ; Jordan Boyd-Graber</p><p>Abstract: Topic modeling with a tree-based prior has been used for a variety of applications because it can encode correlations between words that traditional topic modeling cannot. However, its expressive power comes at the cost of more complicated inference. We extend the SPARSELDA (Yao et al., 2009) inference scheme for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to tree-based topic models. This sampling scheme computes the exact conditional distribution for Gibbs sampling much more quickly than enumerating all possible latent variable assignments. We further improve performance by iteratively refining the sampling distribution only when needed. Experiments show that the proposed techniques dramatically improve the computation time.</p><p>6 0.11175175 <a title="31-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Finding_Bursty_Topics_from_Microblogs.html">98 acl-2012-Finding Bursty Topics from Microblogs</a></p>

<p>Author: Viet-An Nguyen ; Jordan Boyd-Graber ; Philip Resnik</p><p>Abstract: One of the key tasks for analyzing conversational data is segmenting it into coherent topic segments. However, most models of topic segmentation ignore the social aspect of conversations, focusing only on the words used. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian nonparametric model, Speaker Identity for Topic Segmentation (SITS), that discovers (1) the topics used in a conversation, (2) how these topics are shared across conversations, (3) when these topics shift, and (4) a person-specific tendency to introduce new topics. We evaluate against current unsupervised segmentation models to show that including personspecific information improves segmentation performance on meeting corpora and on political debates. Moreover, we provide evidence that SITS captures an individual’s tendency to introduce new topics in political contexts, via analysis of the 2008 US presidential debates and the television program Crossfire. 1 Topic Segmentation as a Social Process Conversation, interactive discussion between two or more people, is one of the most essential and common forms of communication. Whether in an informal situation or in more formal settings such as a political debate or business meeting, a conversation is often not about just one thing: topics evolve and are replaced as the conversation unfolds. Discovering this hidden structure in conversations is a key problem for conversational assistants (Tur et al., 2010) and tools that summarize (Murray et al., 2005) and display (Ehlen et al., 2007) conversational data. Topic segmentation also can illuminate individuals’ agendas (Boydstun et al., 2011), patterns of agree- ment and disagreement (Hawes et al., 2009; Abbott 78 Jordan Boyd-Graber iSchool and UMIACS University of Maryland College Park, MD jbg@ umiac s .umd .edu Philip Resnik Department of Linguistics and UMIACS University of Maryland College Park, MD re snik @ umd .edu al., 2011), and relationships among conversational participants (Ireland et al., 2011). One of the most natural ways to capture conversational structure is topic segmentation (Reynar, 1998; Purver, 2011). Topic segmentation approaches range from simple heuristic methods based on lexical similarity (Morris and Hirst, 1991 ; Hearst, 1997) to more intricate generative models and supervised methods (Georgescul et al., 2006; Purver et al., 2006; Gruber et al., 2007; Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008), which have been shown to outperform the established heuristics. However, previous computational work on conversational structure, particularly in topic discovery and topic segmentation, focuses primarily on conet tent, ignoring the speakers. We argue that, because conversation is a social process, we can understand conversational phenomena better by explicitly modeling behaviors of conversational participants. In Section 2, we incorporate participant identity in a new model we call Speaker Identity for Topic Segmentation (SITS), which discovers topical structure in conversation while jointly incorporating a participantlevel social component. Specifically, we explicitly model an individual’s tendency to introduce a topic. After outlining inference in Section 3 and introducing data in Section 4, we use SITS to improve state-ofthe-art-topic segmentation and topic identification models in Section 5. In addition, in Section 6, we also show that the per-speaker model is able to discover individuals who shape and influence the course of a conversation. Finally, we discuss related work and conclude the paper in Section 7. 2 Modeling Multiparty Discussions Data Properties We are interested in turn-taking, multiparty discussion. This is a broad category, inProce Jedijung, sR oefpu thbeli c50 othf K Aonrneua,a8l -M14e Jtiunlgy o 2f0 t1h2e.

More formally, such datasets contain C conversations. A conversation c has Tc turns, each of which is a maximal uninterrupted utterance by one speaker.1 In each turn t ∈ [1, Tc], a speaker ac,t utters N words {wc,t,n}. Eatch ∈ w [1o,rTd is from a vocabulary of size V , {awnd th}ere are M distinct speakers. Modeling Approaches The key insight of topic segmentation is that segments evince lexical cohesion (Galley et al., 2003; Olney and Cai, 2005). Words within a segment will look more like their neighbors than other words. This insight has been used to tune supervised methods (Hsueh et al., 2006) and inspire unsupervised models of lexical cohesion using bags of words (Purver et al., 2006) and language models (Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008). We too take the unsupervised statistical approach. It requires few resources and is applicable in many domains without extensive training. Like previous approaches, we consider each turn to be a bag of words generated from an admixture of topics. Topics—after the topic modeling literature (Blei and Lafferty, 2009)—are multinomial distributions over terms. These topics are part of a generative model posited to have produced a corpus. However, topic models alone cannot model the dynamics of a conversation. Topic models typically do not model the temporal dynamics of individual documents, and those that do (Wang et al., 2008; Gerrish and Blei, 2010) are designed for larger documents and are not applicable here because they assume that most topics appear in every time slice. Instead, we endow each turn with a binary latent variable lc,t, called the topic shift. This latent variable signifies whether the speaker changed the topic of the conversation. To capture the topic-controlling behavior of the speakers across different conversations, we further associate each speaker m with a latent topic shift tendency, πm. Informally, this variable is intended to capture the propensity of a speaker to effect a topic shift. Formally, it represents the probability that the speaker m will change the topic (distribution) of a conversation. We take a Bayesian nonparametric approach (M¨uller and Quintana, 2004). Unlike 1Note the distinction with phonetic definition are bounded by silence. utterances, which by 79 parametric models, which a priori fix the number of topics, nonparametric models use a flexible number of topics to better represent data. Nonparametric distributions such as the Dirichlet process (Ferguson, 1973) share statistical strength among conversations using a hierarchical model, such as the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) (Teh et al., 2006). 2.1 Generative Process In this section, we develop SITS, a generative model of multiparty discourse that jointly discovers topics and speaker-specific topic shifts from an unannotated corpus (Figure 1a). As in the hierarchical Dirichlet process (Teh et al., 2006), we allow an unbounded number of topics to be shared among the turns of the corpus. Topics are drawn from a base distribution H over multinomial distributions over the vocabulary, a finite Dirichlet with symmetric prior λ. Unlike the HDP, where every document (here, every turn) draws a new multinomial distribution from a Dirichlet process, the social and temporal dynamics of a conversation, as specified by the binary topic shift indicator lc,t, determine when new draws happen. The full generative process is as follows: 1. For speaker m ∈ [1, M], draw speaker shift probability πm ∼ Beta(γ) 2. Draw∼ global probability measure G0 ∼ DP(α, H) 3. For each conversation c ∈ [1, C] (a) Draw conversation distribution Gc ∼ DP(α0 , G0) (b) For each turn t ∈ [1, Tc] with speaker ac,t i. If t = 1, set the topic shift lc,t = 1. Otherwise, draw lc,t ∼ Bernoulli(πac,t ). ii. If lc,t = 1∼, d Breawrn Gc,t ∼ DP(αc, Gc). Otherwise, set Gc,t ≡ Gc,t−1 . iii. For each word ≡ind Gex n ∈ [1, Nc,t] • Draw ψc,t,n ∼ Gc,t • DDrraaww wc,t,n ∼ Multinomial(ψc,t,n) The hierarchy of Dirichlet processes allows statistical strength to be shared across contexts; within a conversation and across conversations. The perspeaker topic shift tendency πm allows speaker identity to influence the evolution of topics. To make notation concrete and aligned with the topic segmentation, we introduce notation for segments in a conversation. A segment s of conversation c is a sequence of turns [τ, τ0] such that lc,τ = lc,τ0+1 = 1and lc,t = 0, ∀t ∈ (τ, τ0] . When lc,t = 0, Gc,t is the same =Gc 0,t,−∀1t a ∈nd ( aτ,llτ τtopics (i.e. multinomial distributions over words) {ψc,t,n} that generate words in turn t and the topics{ ψ{ψc,t}−1,n} that generate words in turn t −1 come from{ψ ψthc,et −s1a,mn}e as Figure 1: Graphical model representations of our proposed models: (a) the nonparametric version; (b) the parametric version. Nodes represent random variables (shaded ones are observed), lines are probabilistic dependencies. Plates represent repetition. The innermost plates are turns, grouped in conversations. distribution. Thus all topics used in a segment s are drawn from a single distribution, Gc,s, , , , Gc,s | lc,1 lc,2 · · · lc,Tc , αc, Gc ∼ DP(αc, Gc) (1) For notational convenience, Sc denotes the number of segments in conversation c, and st denotes the segment index of turn t. We emphasize that all segment-related notations are derived from the posterior over the topic shifts land not part of the model itself. Parametric Version SITS is a generalization of a parametric model (Figure 1b) where each turn has a multinomial distribution over K topics. In the parametric case, the number of topics K is fixed. Each topic, as before, is a multinomial distribution φ1 . . . φK. In the parametric case, each turn t in conversation c has an explicit multinomial distribution over K topics θc,t, identical for turns within a segment. A new topic distribution θ is drawn from a Dirichlet distribution parameterized by α when the topic shift indicator lis 1. The parametric version does not share strength within or across conversations, unlike SITS. When applied on a single conversation without speaker identity (all speakers are identical) it is equivalent to (Purver et al., 2006). In our experiments (Section 5), we compare against both. 80 3 Inference To find the latent variables that best explain observed data, we use Gibbs sampling, a widely used Markov chain Monte Carlo inference technique (Neal, 2000; Resnik and Hardisty, 2010). The state space is latent variables for topic indices assigned to all tokens z = {zc,t,n} and topic shifts assigned to turns l= {lc,t}. {Wze marginalize over all other latent variablle =s. Here, we only present the conditional sampling equations; for more details, see our supplement.2 3.1 Sampling Topic Assignments To sample zc,t,n, the index of the shared topic assigned to token n of turn t in conversation c, we need to sample the path assigning each word token to a segment-specific topic, each segment-specific topic to a conversational topic and each conversational topic to a shared topic. For efficiency, we make use of the minimal path assumption (Wallach, 2008) to generate these assignments.3 Under the minimal path assumption, an observation is assumed to have been generated by using a new distribution if and only if there is no existing distribution with the same value. 2 http://www.cs.umd.edu/∼vietan/topicshift/appendix.pdf 3We also investigated using the maximal assumption and fully sampling assignments. We found the minimal path assumption worked as well as explicitly sampling seating assignments and that the maximal path assumption worked less well. We use Nc,s,k to denote the number of tokens in segment s in conversation c assigned topic k; Nc,k denotes the total number of segment-specific topics in conversation c assigned topic k and Nk denotes the number of conversational topics assigned topic k. TWk,w denotes the number of times the shared topic k is assigned to word w in the vocabulary. Marginal counts are represented with · and ∗ represents all hyperparameters. The condit·ional d∗istribution for zc,t,n is P(zc,t,n = k | wc,t,n = w, z−c,t,n, w−c,t,n, l, ∗) ∝ Nc−,sct ,kn+αNc −c,s−ct,kct·,n Nn+c −,·αc ,t0cnN +k−· αc,t0 ,n + αK ×  VT1 W k−, ·c,wctk, n e+w V.λ( 2), Here V is the size of the vocabulary, K is the current number of shared topics and the superscript −c,t,n denotes counts without considering wc,t,n. In Equation 2, the first factor is proportional to the probability of sampling a path according to the minimal path assumption; the second factor is proportional to the likelihood of observing w given the sampled topic. Since an uninformed prior is used, when a new topic is sampled, all tokens are equiprobable. 3.2 Sampling Topic Shifts Sampling the topic shift variable lc,t requires us to consider merging or splitting segments. We use kc,t to denote the shared topic indices of all tokens in turn t of conversation c; Sac,t,x to denote the number of times speaker ac,t is assigned the topic shift with value x ∈ {0, 1}; Jcx,s to denote the number of topics in segment s 1o}f conversation c if lc,t = x and Ncx,s,j to denote the number of tokens assigned to the segment-specific topic j when lc,t = x.4 Again, the superscript −c,t is used to denote exclusion of turn t of conversation c in the corresponding counts. Recall that the topic shift is a binary variable. We use 0 to represent the case that the topic distribution is identical to the previous turn. We sample this assignment P(lc,t = 0 | l−c,t, w, k, a, ∗) ∝ SSa−a−cc,c,ct,t , t·,0++ 2 γγ×αcJ0c,sNtx=Qc01,sjJt=c,0·,1s(tx(N −c0 1,s +t,j α−c) 1)!. (3) 4Deterministically knowQing the path assignments is the primary efficiency motivation for using the minimal path assumption. The alternative is to explicitly sample the path assignments, which is more complicated (for both notation and computation). This option is spelled in full detail in the supplementary material. 81 In Equation 3, the first factor is proportional to the probability of assigning a topic shift of value 0 to speaker ac,t and the second factor is proportional to the joint probability of all topics in segment st of conversation c when lc,t = 0. The other alternative is for the topic shift to be 1, which represents the introduction of a new distri- bution over topics inside an existing segment.

In this case lc,t = 1 means splitting the current segment, which results in two joint probabilities for two segments. 4 Datasets This section introduces the three corpora we use. We preprocess the data to remove stopwords and remove turns containing fewer than five tokens. The ICSI Meeting Corpus: The ICSI Meeting Corpus (Janin et al., 2003) is 75 transcribed meetings. For evaluation, we used a standard set of reference segmentations (Galley et al., 2003) of 25 meetings. Segmentations are binary, i.e., each point of the document is either a segment boundary or not, and on average each meeting has 8 segment boundaries. After preprocessing, there are 60 unique speakers and the vocabulary contains 3346 non-stopword tokens. The 2008 Presidential Election Debates Our second dataset contains three annotated presidential debates (Boydstun et al., 2011) between Barack Obama and John McCain and a vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin. Each turn is one of two types: questions (Q) from the moderator or responses (R) from a candidate. Each clause in a turn is coded with a Question Topic (TQ) and a Response Topic (TR). Thus, a turn has a list of TQ’s and TR’s both of length equal to the number of clauses in the turn. Topics are from the Policy Agendas Topics SpeakerTypeTurn clausesTQTR BrokawQbSeenfo.r Oeib ta gmeat,s [b.e.t.t]er A arned yo thuey sa oyuingght [. to. b]e th parte tphaere Adm foerri tchaant? economy is going to get much worse1N/A ObamaR[hN.o .m,.]e Is B a,um mtac mokenofs itdu iermenpt o ahrabt oaun th tel yt ,h we c Aaen’rm epea gryoic ithnangei e trco bo hinlaosvm e[.y t. o. h]elp ordinary familes be able to stay in their1 1 4 BrokawQSen.

The topics (TQ and TR) are from the Policy Agendas Topics Codebook which contains the following codes of topic: Macroeconomics Community Development (14), Government Operations (20). (1), Housing & Codebook, a manual inventory of 19 major topics and 225 subtopics.5 Table 1 shows an example annotation. To get reference segmentations, we assign each turn a real value from 0 to 1indicating how much a turn changes the topic. For a question-typed turn, the score is the fraction of clause topics not appearing in the previous turn; for response-typed turns, the score is the fraction of clause topics that do not appear in the corresponding question. This results in a set of non-binary reference segmentations. For evaluation metrics that require binary segmentations, we create a binary segmentation by setting a turn as a segment boundary if the computed score is 1. This threshold is chosen to include only true segment boundaries. CNN’s Crossfire Crossfire was a weekly U.S. television “talking heads” program engineered to incite heated arguments (hence the name). Each episode features two recurring hosts, two guests, and clips from the week’s news. Our Crossfire dataset contains 1134 transcribed episodes aired between 2000 and 2004.6 There are 2567 unique speakers. Unlike the previous two datasets, Crossfire does not have explicit topic segmentations, so we use it to explore speaker-specific characteristics (Section 6). 5 Topic Segmentation Experiments In this section, we examine how well SITS can replicate annotations of when new topics are introduced. 5 http://www.policyagendas.org/page/topic-codebook 6 http://www.cs.umd.edu/∼vietan/topicshift/crossfire.zip 82 We discuss metrics for evaluating an algorithm’s segmentation against a gold annotation, describe our experimental setup, and report those results. Evaluation Metrics To evaluate segmentations, we use Pk (Beeferman et al., 1999) and WindowDiff (WD) (Pevzner and Hearst, 2002). Both metrics measure the probability that two points in a document will be incorrectly separated by a segment boundary. Both techniques consider all spans of length k in the document and count whether the two endpoints of the window are (im)properly segmented against the gold segmentation. However, these metrics have drawbacks. First, they require both hypothesized and reference segmentations to be binary. Many algorithms (e.g., probabilistic approaches) give non-binary segmentations where candidate boundaries have real-valued scores (e.g., probability or confidence). Thus, evaluation requires arbitrary thresholding to binarize soft scores. To be fair, thresholds are set so the number of segments are equal to a predefined value (Purver et al., 2006; Galley et al., 2003). To overcome these limitations, we also use Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) (Rubner et al., 2000), a metric that measures the distance between two distributions. The EMD is the minimal cost to transform one distribution into the other. Each segmentation can be considered a multi-dimensional distribution where each candidate boundary is a dimension. In EMD, a distance function across features allows partial credit for “near miss” segment boundaries. In addition, because EMD operates on distributions, we can compute the distance between non-binary hypothesized segmentations with binary or real-valued reference segmentations. We use the FastEMD implementation (Pele and Werman, 2009). Experimental Methods We applied the following methods to discover topic segmentations in a document: • TextTiling (Hearst, 1997) is one of the earliest generalpurpose topic segmentation algorithms, sliding a fixedwidth window to detect major changes in lexical similarity. • P-NoSpeaker-S: parametric version without speaker identity run on keaerc-hS conversation (Purver et al., 2006) • P-NoSpeaker-M: parametric version without speaker identity run on Mall conversations • P-SITS: the parametric version of SITS with speaker identity run on all conversations • NP-HMM: the HMM-based nonparametric model which a single topic per turn. This model can be considered a Sticky HDP-HMM (Fox et al., 2008) with speaker identity. • NP-SITS: the nonparametric version of SITS with speaker identity run on all conversations. Parameter Settings and Implementations experiment, all parameters same as in (Hearst, 1997). of TextTiling In our are the For statistical models, Gibbs sampling with 10 randomly initialized chains is used. Initial hyperparameter values are sampled from U(0, 1) to favor sparsity; statistics are collected after 500 burn-in iterations with a lag of 25 iterations over a total of 5000 iterations; and slice sampling (Neal, 2003) optimizes hyperparameters. Results and Analysis Table 2 shows the perfor- mance of various models on the topic segmentation problem, using the ICSI corpus and the 2008 debates. Consistent with previous results, probabilistic models outperform TextTiling. In addition, among the probabilistic models, the models that had access to speaker information consistently segment better than those lacking such information, supporting our assertion that there is benefit to modeling conversation as a social process. Furthermore, NP-SITS outperforms NP-HMM in both experiments, suggesting that using a distribution over topics to turns is better than using a single topic. This is consistent with parametric results reported in (Purver et al., 2006). The contribution of speaker identity seems more valuable in the debate setting. Debates are characterized by strong rewards for setting the agenda; dodging a question or moving the debate toward an oppo83 nent’s weakness can be useful strategies (Boydstun et al., 2011). In contrast, meetings (particularly lowstakes ICSI meetings) are characterized by pragmatic rather than strategic topic shifts. Second, agendasetting roles are clearer in formal debates; a modera- tor is tasked with setting the agenda and ensuring the conversation does not wander too much. The nonparametric model does best on the smaller debate dataset. We suspect that an evaluation that directly accessed the topic quality, either via prediction (Teh et al., 2006) or interpretability (Chang et al., 2009) would favor the nonparametric model more. 6 Evaluating Topic Shift Tendency In this section, we focus on the ability of SITS to capture speaker-level attributes. Recall that SITS associates with each speaker a topic shift tendency π that represents the probability of asserting a new topic in the conversation. While topic segmentation is a well studied problem, there are no established quantitative measurements of an individual’s ability to control a conversation. To evaluate whether the tendency is capturing meaningful characteristics of speakers, we compare our inferred tendencies against insights from political science. 2008 Elections To obtain a posterior estimate of π (Figure 3) we create 10 chains with hyperparameters sampled from the uniform distribution U(0, 1) and averaged π over 10 chains (as described in Section 5). In these debates, Ifill is the moderator of the debate between Biden and Palin; Brokaw, Lehrer and Schieffer are the three moderators of three debates between Obama and McCain. Here “Question” denotes questions from audiences in “town hall” debate. The role of this “speaker” can be considered equivalent to the debate moderator. The topic shift tendencies of moderators are much higher than for candidates. In the three debates between Obama and McCain, the moderators— Brokaw, Lehrer and Schieffer—have significantly higher scores than both candidates. This is a useful reality check, since in a debate the moderators are the ones asking questions and literally controlling the topical focus. Interestingly, in the vice-presidential debate, the score of moderator Ifill is only slightly higher than those of Palin and Biden; this is consistent with media commentary characterizing her as a size of the metrics Pk and WindowDiff chosen to replicate previous results. weak moderator.7 Similarly, the “Question” speaker had a relatively high variance, consistent with an amalgamation of many distinct speakers. These topic shift tendencies suggest that all candidates manage to succeed at some points in setting and controlling the debate topics. Our model gives Obama a slightly higher score than McCain, consistent with social science claims (Boydstun et al., 2011) that Obama had the lead in setting the agenda over McCain. Table 4 shows of SITS-detected topic shifts. Crossfire Crossfire, unlike the debates, has many speakers. This allows us to examine more closely what we can learn about speakers’ topic shift tendency. We verified that SITS can segment topics, and assuming that changing the topic is useful for a speaker, how can we characterize who does so effectively? We examine the relationship between topic shift tendency, social roles, and political ideology. To focus on frequent speakers, we filter out speakers with fewer than 30 turns. Most speakers have relatively small π, with the mode around 0.3. There are, however, speakers with very high topic shift tendencies. Table 5 shows the speakers having the highest values according to SITS. We find that there are three general patterns for who influences the course of a conversation in Crossfire. First, there are structural “speakers” the show uses to frame and propose new topics. These are 7 http://harpers.org/archive/2008/10/hbc-90003659 84 2008 Presidential Election Debates (larger means greater tendency) audience questions, news clips (e.g. many of Gore’s and Bush’s turns from 2000), and voice overs. That SITS is able to recover these is reassuring. Second, the stable of regular hosts receives high topic shift tendencies, which is reasonable given their experience with the format and ostensible moderation roles (in practice they also stoke lively discussion). The remaining class is more interesting. The remaining non-hosts with high topic shift tendency are relative moderates on the political spectrum: • John Kasich, one of few Republicans to support the assault weapons ban and now governor of Ohio, a swing state • Christine Todd Whitman, former Republican governor of CNehrwis Jersey, a very iDtmemano,c froartmice srt Ratee • John McCain, who before 2008 was known as a “maverick” for working with Democrats (e.g. Russ Feingold) This suggests that, despite Crossfire’s tendency to create highly partisan debates, those who are able to work across the political spectrum may best be able to influence the topic under discussion in highly polarized contexts. Table 4 shows detected topic shifts from these speakers; two of these examples (McCain and Whitman) show disagreement of Republicans with President Bush. In the other, Kasich is defending a Republican plan (school vouchers) popular with traditional Democratic constituencies. 7 Related and Future Work In the realm of statistical models, a number of techniques incorporate social connections and identity to explain content in social networks (Chang and Blei, atsbDePMmwphIncFiAoasCrtuLleycnNdAg:irIs’SatYphyo,weumckItGrasy’.qoheivfnuIakgrsdt?heo vna,dtbpJ.omslrheyivcaBnwdspeur[.ihodqtef]nuar,slihmetdnyuaopi’s-SbeI[hBn.FCtDvHLcr]ligEemIhysNoa:nFbvWidxeAltEsghnmRboad:eics[yr.,fmtuwleinha][go.,dLYftweur]–’lhsdaitngxerkbIfoat.hqeslkOufinrmbtyoeha,rit[n.geholyasc]rdi,wteoaxylpm’sburneItaopfkvicsqr.,n[BYoOtafebxruli.,mcEksGgatvn]roOebpyitmlnorcd.ea[sfviPYtr]lgoandyu., Previous turnTurn detected as shifting topic examples of those with high topic shift tendency 238947156FPAGNQMreouna.mlvsWea†‡kt.iluBonrcseh‡.7586 41702 4863150FBCKWMealchgrsitCvA lamuhoin†efr.5 2473509 π.

Apart from those groups, speakers with the highest tendency were political moderates. 2009) and scientific corpora (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004). However, these models ignore the temporal evolution of content, treating documents as static. Models that do investigate the evolution of topics over time typically ignore the identify of the speaker. For example: models having sticky topics over ngrams (Johnson, 2010), sticky HDP-HMM (Fox et al., 2008); models that are an amalgam of sequential models and topic models (Griffiths et al., 2005; Wal85 lach, 2006; Gruber et al., 2007; Ahmed and Xing, 2008; Boyd-Graber and Blei, 2008; Du et al., 2010); or explicit models of time or other relevant features as a distinct latent variable (Wang and McCallum, 2006; Eisenstein et al., 2010). In contrast, SITS jointly models topic and individuals’ tendency to control a conversation. Not only does SITS outperform other models using standard computational linguistics baselines, but it also pro- poses intriguing hypotheses for social scientists. Associating each speaker with a scalar that models their tendency to change the topic does improve performance on standard tasks, but it’s inadequate to fully describe an individual. Modeling individuals’ perspective (Paul and Girju, 2010), “side” (Thomas et al., 2006), or personal preferences for topics (Grimmer, 2009) would enrich the model and better illuminate the interaction of influence and topic. Statistical analysis of political discourse can help discover patterns that political scientists, who often work via a “close reading,” might otherwise miss. We plan to work with social scientists to validate our implicit hypothesis that our topic shift tendency correlates well with intuitive measures of “influence.” Acknowledgements This research was funded in part by the Army Research Laboratory through ARL Cooperative Agreement W91 1NF-09-2-0072 and by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), through the Army Research Laboratory.

<p>Author: Xinyan Xiao ; Deyi Xiong ; Min Zhang ; Qun Liu ; Shouxun Lin</p><p>Abstract: Previous work using topic model for statistical machine translation (SMT) explore topic information at the word level. However, SMT has been advanced from word-based paradigm to phrase/rule-based paradigm. We therefore propose a topic similarity model to exploit topic information at the synchronous rule level for hierarchical phrase-based translation. We associate each synchronous rule with a topic distribution, and select desirable rules according to the similarity of their topic distributions with given documents. We show that our model significantly improves the translation performance over the baseline on NIST Chinese-to-English translation experiments. Our model also achieves a better performance and a faster speed than previous approaches that work at the word level.</p><p>4 0.78960699 <a title="31-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-Historical_Analysis_of_Legal_Opinions_with_a_Sparse_Mixed-Effects_Latent_Variable_Model.html">110 acl-2012-Historical Analysis of Legal Opinions with a Sparse Mixed-Effects Latent Variable Model</a></p>
<p>Author: William Yang Wang ; Elijah Mayfield ; Suresh Naidu ; Jeremiah Dittmar</p><p>Abstract: We propose a latent variable model to enhance historical analysis of large corpora. This work extends prior work in topic modelling by incorporating metadata, and the interactions between the components in metadata, in a general way. To test this, we collect a corpus of slavery-related United States property law judgements sampled from the years 1730 to 1866. We study the language use in these legal cases, with a special focus on shifts in opinions on controversial topics across different regions. Because this is a longitudinal data set, we are also interested in understanding how these opinions change over the course of decades. We show that the joint learning scheme of our sparse mixed-effects model improves on other state-of-the-art generative and discriminative models on the region and time period identification tasks. Experiments show that our sparse mixed-effects model is more accurate quantitatively and qualitatively interesting, and that these improvements are robust across different parameter settings.</p><p>5 0.78930676 <a title="31-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-Efficient_Tree-Based_Topic_Modeling.html">79 acl-2012-Efficient Tree-Based Topic Modeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuening Hu ; Jordan Boyd-Graber</p><p>Abstract: Topic modeling with a tree-based prior has been used for a variety of applications because it can encode correlations between words that traditional topic modeling cannot. However, its expressive power comes at the cost of more complicated inference. We extend the SPARSELDA (Yao et al., 2009) inference scheme for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to tree-based topic models. This sampling scheme computes the exact conditional distribution for Gibbs sampling much more quickly than enumerating all possible latent variable assignments. We further improve performance by iteratively refining the sampling distribution only when needed. Experiments show that the proposed techniques dramatically improve the computation time.</p><p>6 0.72171164 <a title="31-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-Topic_Models_for_Dynamic_Translation_Model_Adaptation.html">199 acl-2012-Topic Models for Dynamic Translation Model Adaptation</a></p>

<p>Author: Ingrid Falk ; Claire Gardent ; Jean-Charles Lamirel</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to the automatic acquisition of a Verbnet like classification of French verbs which involves the use (i) of a neural clustering method which associates clusters with features, (ii) of several supervised and unsupervised evaluation metrics and (iii) of various existing syntactic and semantic lexical resources. We evaluate our approach on an established test set and show that it outperforms previous related work with an Fmeasure of 0.70.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.77164292 <a title="31-lda-2" href="./acl-2012-Authorship_Attribution_with_Author-aware_Topic_Models.html">31 acl-2012-Authorship Attribution with Author-aware Topic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Yanir Seroussi ; Fabian Bohnert ; Ingrid Zukerman</p><p>Abstract: Authorship attribution deals with identifying the authors of anonymous texts. Building on our earlier finding that the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model can be used to improve authorship attribution accuracy, we show that employing a previously-suggested Author-Topic (AT) model outperforms LDA when applied to scenarios with many authors. In addition, we define a model that combines LDA and AT by representing authors and documents over two disjoint topic sets, and show that our model outperforms LDA, AT and support vector machines on datasets with many authors.</p><p>3 0.69993347 <a title="31-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Using_Rejuvenation_to_Improve_Particle_Filtering_for_Bayesian_Word_Segmentation.html">211 acl-2012-Using Rejuvenation to Improve Particle Filtering for Bayesian Word Segmentation</a></p>

By adding rejuvenation to a particle filter, we are able to considerably improve its performance, both in terms of finding higher probability and higher accuracy solutions.</p><p>4 0.61678123 <a title="31-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Tweet_Recommendation_with_Graph_Co-Ranking.html">205 acl-2012-Tweet Recommendation with Graph Co-Ranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui Yan ; Mirella Lapata ; Xiaoming Li</p><p>Abstract: Mirella Lapata‡ Xiaoming Li†, \ ‡Institute for Language, \State Key Laboratory of Software Cognition and Computation, Development Environment, University of Edinburgh, Beihang University, Edinburgh EH8 9AB, UK Beijing 100083, China mlap@ inf .ed .ac .uk lxm@pku .edu .cn 2012.1 Twitter enables users to send and read textbased posts ofup to 140 characters, known as tweets. As one of the most popular micro-blogging services, Twitter attracts millions of users, producing millions of tweets daily. Shared information through this service spreads faster than would have been possible with traditional sources, however the proliferation of user-generation content poses challenges to browsing and finding valuable information. In this paper we propose a graph-theoretic model for tweet recommendation that presents users with items they may have an interest in. Our model ranks tweets and their authors simultaneously using several networks: the social network connecting the users, the network connecting the tweets, and a third network that ties the two together. Tweet and author entities are ranked following a co-ranking algorithm based on the intuition that that there is a mutually reinforcing relationship between tweets and their authors that could be reflected in the rankings. We show that this framework can be parametrized to take into account user preferences, the popularity of tweets and their authors, and diversity. Experimental evaluation on a large dataset shows that our model out- performs competitive approaches by a large margin.</p><p>5 0.60495871 <a title="31-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Native_Language_Detection_with_Tree_Substitution_Grammars.html">154 acl-2012-Native Language Detection with Tree Substitution Grammars</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin Swanson ; Eugene Charniak</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the potential of Tree Substitution Grammars as a source of features for native language detection, the task of inferring an author’s native language from text in a different language. We compare two state of the art methods for Tree Substitution Grammar induction and show that features from both methods outperform previous state of the art results at native language detection. Furthermore, we contrast these two induction algorithms and show that the Bayesian approach produces superior classification results with a smaller feature set.</p><p>6 0.60050422 <a title="31-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Exploiting_Latent_Information_to_Predict_Diffusions_of_Novel_Topics_on_Social_Networks.html">86 acl-2012-Exploiting Latent Information to Predict Diffusions of Novel Topics on Social Networks</a></p>

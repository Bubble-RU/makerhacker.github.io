<p>Author: Arjun Mukherjee ; Bing Liu</p><p>Abstract: Aspect extraction is a central problem in sentiment analysis. Current methods either extract aspects without categorizing them, or extract and categorize them using unsupervised topic modeling. By categorizing, we mean the synonymous aspects should be clustered into the same category. In this paper, we solve the problem in a different setting where the user provides some seed words for a few aspect categories and the model extracts and clusters aspect terms into categories simultaneously. This setting is important because categorizing aspects is a subjective task. For different application purposes, different categorizations may be needed. Some form of user guidance is desired. In this paper, we propose two statistical models to solve this seeded problem, which aim to discover exactly what the user wants. Our experimental results show that the two proposed models are indeed able to perform the task effectively. 1</p><p>3 0.19863749 <a title="144-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Fine_Granular_Aspect_Analysis_using_Latent_Structural_Models.html">100 acl-2012-Fine Granular Aspect Analysis using Latent Structural Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Fang ; Minlie Huang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a structural learning model forjoint sentiment classification and aspect analysis of text at various levels of granularity. Our model aims to identify highly informative sentences that are aspect-specific in online custom reviews. The primary advantages of our model are two-fold: first, it performs document-level and sentence-level sentiment polarity classification jointly; second, it is able to find informative sentences that are closely related to some respects in a review, which may be helpful for aspect-level sentiment analysis such as aspect-oriented summarization. The proposed method was evaluated with 9,000 Chinese restaurant reviews. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that our model obtains promising performance. 1</p><p>4 0.18644571 <a title="144-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Community_Answer_Summarization_for_Multi-Sentence_Question_with_Group_L1_Regularization.html">55 acl-2012-Community Answer Summarization for Multi-Sentence Question with Group L1 Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Wen Chan ; Xiangdong Zhou ; Wei Wang ; Tat-Seng Chua</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel answer summarization method for community Question Answering services (cQAs) to address the problem of “incomplete answer”, i.e., the “best answer” of a complex multi-sentence question misses valuable information that is contained in other answers. In order to automatically generate a novel and non-redundant community answer summary, we segment the complex original multi-sentence question into several sub questions and then propose a general Conditional Random Field (CRF) based answer summary method with group L1 regularization. Various textual and non-textual QA features are explored. Specifically, we explore four different types of contextual factors, namely, the information novelty and non-redundancy modeling for local and non-local sentence interactions under question segmentation. To further unleash the potential of the abundant cQA features, we introduce the group L1 regularization for feature learning. Experimental results on a Yahoo! Answers dataset show that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on cQA summarization task.</p><p>5 0.15810034 <a title="144-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Spice_it_up%3F_Mining_Refinements_to_Online_Instructions_from_User_Generated_Content.html">182 acl-2012-Spice it up?

<p>Author: Gregory Druck ; Bo Pang</p><p>Abstract: There are a growing number of popular web sites where users submit and review instructions for completing tasks as varied as building a table and baking a pie. In addition to providing their subjective evaluation, reviewers often provide actionable refinements. These refinements clarify, correct, improve, or provide alternatives to the original instructions. However, identifying and reading all relevant reviews is a daunting task for a user. In this paper, we propose a generative model that jointly identifies user-proposed refinements in instruction reviews at multiple granularities, and aligns them to the appropriate steps in the original instructions. Labeled data is not readily available for these tasks, so we focus on the unsupervised setting. In experiments in the recipe domain, our model provides 90. 1% F1 for predicting refinements at the review level, and 77.0% F1 for predicting refinement segments within reviews.</p><p>6 0.15036304 <a title="144-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-SITS%3A_A_Hierarchical_Nonparametric_Model_using_Speaker_Identity_for_Topic_Segmentation_in_Multiparty_Conversations.html">171 acl-2012-SITS: A Hierarchical Nonparametric Model using Speaker Identity for Topic Segmentation in Multiparty Conversations</a></p>

<p>Author: Weiwei Guo ; Mona Diab</p><p>Abstract: Sentence Similarity is the process of computing a similarity score between two sentences. Previous sentence similarity work finds that latent semantics approaches to the problem do not perform well due to insufficient information in single sentences. In this paper, we show that by carefully handling words that are not in the sentences (missing words), we can train a reliable latent variable model on sentences. In the process, we propose a new evaluation framework for sentence similarity: Concept Definition Retrieval. The new framework allows for large scale tuning and testing of Sentence Similarity models. Experiments on the new task and previous data sets show significant improvement of our model over baselines and other traditional latent variable models. Our results indicate comparable and even better performance than current state of the art systems addressing the problem of sentence similarity.</p><p>2 0.96797544 <a title="144-lda-2" href="./acl-2012-A_Meta_Learning_Approach_to_Grammatical_Error_Correction.html">15 acl-2012-A Meta Learning Approach to Grammatical Error Correction</a></p>

<p>Author: Patrick Pantel ; Thomas Lin ; Michael Gamon</p><p>Abstract: We predict entity type distributions in Web search queries via probabilistic inference in graphical models that capture how entitybearing queries are generated. We jointly model the interplay between latent user intents that govern queries and unobserved entity types, leveraging observed signals from query formulations and document clicks. We apply the models to resolve entity types in new queries and to assign prior type distributions over an existing knowledge base. Our models are efficiently trained using maximum likelihood estimation over millions of real-world Web search queries. We show that modeling user intent significantly improves entity type resolution for head queries over the state ofthe art, on several metrics, without degradation in tail query performance.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.96253544 <a title="144-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Modeling_Review_Comments.html">144 acl-2012-Modeling Review Comments</a></p>

<p>Author: Xingyuan Peng ; Dengfeng Ke ; Bo Xu</p><p>Abstract: Conventional Automated Essay Scoring (AES) measures may cause severe problems when directly applied in scoring Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcription as they are error sensitive and unsuitable for the characteristic of ASR transcription. Therefore, we introduce a framework of Finite State Transducer (FST) to avoid the shortcomings. Compared with the Latent Semantic Analysis with Support Vector Regression (LSA-SVR) method (stands for the conventional measures), our FST method shows better performance especially towards the ASR transcription. In addition, we apply the synonyms similarity to expand the FST model. The final scoring performance reaches an acceptable level of 0.80 which is only 0.07 lower than the correlation (0.87) between human raters.</p><p>6 0.92591166 <a title="144-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Learning_the_Latent_Semantics_of_a_Concept_from_its_Definition.html">132 acl-2012-Learning the Latent Semantics of a Concept from its Definition</a></p>

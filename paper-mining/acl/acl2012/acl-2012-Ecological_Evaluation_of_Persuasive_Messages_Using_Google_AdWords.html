<p>Author: Alexandre Davis ; Adriano Veloso ; Altigran Soares ; Alberto Laender ; Wagner Meira Jr.</p><p>Abstract: The named entity disambiguation task is to resolve the many-to-many correspondence between ambiguous names and the unique realworld entity. This task can be modeled as a classification problem, provided that positive and negative examples are available for learning binary classifiers. High-quality senseannotated data, however, are hard to be obtained in streaming environments, since the training corpus would have to be constantly updated in order to accomodate the fresh data coming on the stream. On the other hand, few positive examples plus large amounts of unlabeled data may be easily acquired. Producing binary classifiers directly from this data, however, leads to poor disambiguation performance. Thus, we propose to enhance the quality of the classifiers using finer-grained variations of the well-known ExpectationMaximization (EM) algorithm. We conducted a systematic evaluation using Twitter streaming data and the results show that our classifiers are extremely effective, providing improvements ranging from 1% to 20%, when compared to the current state-of-the-art biased SVMs, being more than 120 times faster.</p><p>3 0.11776904 <a title="77-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Social_Event_Radar%3A_A_Bilingual_Context_Mining_and_Sentiment_Analysis_Summarization_System.html">180 acl-2012-Social Event Radar: A Bilingual Context Mining and Sentiment Analysis Summarization System</a></p>

<p>Author: Ai Ti Aw ; Lian Hau Lee</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes the personalized normalization of a multilingual chat system that supports chatting in user defined short-forms or abbreviations. One of the major challenges for multilingual chat realized through machine translation technology is the normalization of non-standard, self-created short-forms in the chat message to standard words before translation. Due to the lack of training data and the variations of short-forms used among different social communities, it is hard to normalize and translate chat messages if user uses vocabularies outside the training data and create short-forms freely. We develop a personalized chat normalizer for English and integrate it with a multilingual chat system, allowing user to create and use personalized short-forms in multilingual chat. 1</p><p>5 0.074388005 <a title="77-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Crowdsourcing_Inference-Rule_Evaluation.html">65 acl-2012-Crowdsourcing Inference-Rule Evaluation</a></p>
<p>Author: Naomi Zeichner ; Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: The importance of inference rules to semantic applications has long been recognized and extensive work has been carried out to automatically acquire inference-rule resources. However, evaluating such resources has turned out to be a non-trivial task, slowing progress in the field. In this paper, we suggest a framework for evaluating inference-rule resources. Our framework simplifies a previously proposed “instance-based evaluation” method that involved substantial annotator training, making it suitable for crowdsourcing. We show that our method produces a large amount of annotations with high inter-annotator agreement for a low cost at a short period of time, without requiring training expert annotators.</p><p>6 0.067464359 <a title="77-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-A_System_for_Real-time_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_of_2012_U.S._Presidential_Election_Cycle.html">21 acl-2012-A System for Real-time Twitter Sentiment Analysis of 2012 U.S. Presidential Election Cycle</a></p>

<p>Author: Pierre Magistry ; Benoit Sagot</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an unsupervized segmentation system tested on Mandarin Chinese. Following Harris's Hypothesis in Kempe (1999) and Tanaka-Ishii's (2005) reformulation, we base our work on the Variation of Branching Entropy. We improve on (Jin and Tanaka-Ishii, 2006) by adding normalization and viterbidecoding. This enable us to remove most of the thresholds and parameters from their model and to reach near state-of-the-art results (Wang et al., 201 1) with a simpler system. We provide evaluation on different corpora available from the Segmentation bake-off II (Emerson, 2005) and define a more precise topline for the task using cross-trained supervized system available off-the-shelf (Zhang and Clark, 2010; Zhao and Kit, 2008; Huang and Zhao, 2007)</p><p>3 0.91327804 <a title="77-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Assessing_the_Effect_of_Inconsistent_Assessors_on_Summarization_Evaluation.html">29 acl-2012-Assessing the Effect of Inconsistent Assessors on Summarization Evaluation</a></p>
<p>Author: Karolina Owczarzak ; Peter A. Rankel ; Hoa Trang Dang ; John M. Conroy</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the consistency of human assessors involved in summarization evaluation to understand its effect on system ranking and automatic evaluation techniques. Using Text Analysis Conference data, we measure annotator consistency based on human scoring of summaries for Responsiveness, Readability, and Pyramid scoring. We identify inconsistencies in the data and measure to what extent these inconsistencies affect the ranking of automatic summarization systems. Finally, we examine the stability of automatic metrics (ROUGE and CLASSY) with respect to the inconsistent assessments.</p><p>4 0.84124476 <a title="77-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Historical_Analysis_of_Legal_Opinions_with_a_Sparse_Mixed-Effects_Latent_Variable_Model.html">110 acl-2012-Historical Analysis of Legal Opinions with a Sparse Mixed-Effects Latent Variable Model</a></p>
<p>Author: William Yang Wang ; Elijah Mayfield ; Suresh Naidu ; Jeremiah Dittmar</p><p>Abstract: We propose a latent variable model to enhance historical analysis of large corpora. This work extends prior work in topic modelling by incorporating metadata, and the interactions between the components in metadata, in a general way. To test this, we collect a corpus of slavery-related United States property law judgements sampled from the years 1730 to 1866. We study the language use in these legal cases, with a special focus on shifts in opinions on controversial topics across different regions. Because this is a longitudinal data set, we are also interested in understanding how these opinions change over the course of decades. We show that the joint learning scheme of our sparse mixed-effects model improves on other state-of-the-art generative and discriminative models on the region and time period identification tasks. Experiments show that our sparse mixed-effects model is more accurate quantitatively and qualitatively interesting, and that these improvements are robust across different parameter settings.</p><p>5 0.57053095 <a title="77-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Combining_Coherence_Models_and_Machine_Translation_Evaluation_Metrics_for_Summarization_Evaluation.html">52 acl-2012-Combining Coherence Models and Machine Translation Evaluation Metrics for Summarization Evaluation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ziheng Lin ; Chang Liu ; Hwee Tou Ng ; Min-Yen Kan</p><p>Abstract: An ideal summarization system should produce summaries that have high content coverage and linguistic quality. Many state-ofthe-art summarization systems focus on content coverage by extracting content-dense sentences from source articles. A current research focus is to process these sentences so that they read fluently as a whole. The current AESOP task encourages research on evaluating summaries on content, readability, and overall responsiveness. In this work, we adapt a machine translation metric to measure content coverage, apply an enhanced discourse coherence model to evaluate summary readability, and combine both in a trained regression model to evaluate overall responsiveness. The results show significantly improved performance over AESOP 2011 submitted metrics.</p><p>6 0.55209965 <a title="77-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-A_System_for_Real-time_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_of_2012_U.S._Presidential_Election_Cycle.html">21 acl-2012-A System for Real-time Twitter Sentiment Analysis of 2012 U.S. Presidential Election Cycle</a></p>

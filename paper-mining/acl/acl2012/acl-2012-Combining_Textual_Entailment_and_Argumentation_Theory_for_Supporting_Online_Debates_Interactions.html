</p><p>3 In our paper, we combine textual entailment with argumentation theory to automatically extract the arguments from debates and to evaluate their acceptability. [sent-7, score-1.289]
</p><p>4 1 Introduction  Debatepedia1  Online debate platforms, like , Twitand many others, are becoming more and more popular on the Web. [sent-8, score-0.165]
</p><p>5 In such applications, users are asked to provide their own opinions about selected issues. [sent-9, score-0.026]
</p><p>6 However, it may happen that the debates become rather complicated, with several arguments  ter2  supporting and contradicting each others. [sent-10, score-0.742]
</p><p>7 Thus, it is difficult for potential participants to understand the way the debate is going on, i. [sent-11, score-0.298]
</p><p>8 , which are the current accepted arguments in a debate. [sent-13, score-0.625]
</p><p>9 In this paper, we propose to support participants of online debates with a framework combining Textual Entailment (TE) (Dagan et al. [sent-14, score-0.472]
</p><p>10 In particular, TE is adopted to extract the abstract arguments from natural language debates and to provide the relations among these arguments; argumentation theory is then used to compute the set of accepted arguments among those obtained from the TE module, 1http : / /debatepedia . [sent-16, score-1.777]
</p><p>11 , the arguments shared by the majority of the participants without being attacked by other accepted arguments. [sent-21, score-0.805]
</p><p>12 The originality of the proposed framework lies in the combination of two existing approaches with the goal of supporting participants in their interactions with online debates, by automatically detecting the arguments in natural language  text, and identifying the accepted ones. [sent-22, score-0.936]
</p><p>13 We evaluate the feasibility of our combined approach on a set of arguments extracted from a sample of Debatepedia. [sent-23, score-0.441]
</p><p>14 2  First step: textual entailment  TE was proposed as an applied framework to capture major semantic inference needs across applications in NLP, e. [sent-24, score-0.286]
</p><p>15 It is defined as a relation between two textual fragments, i. [sent-29, score-0.141]
</p><p>16 Entailment holds if the meaning of H can be inferred from the meaning of T, as interpreted by a typical language user. [sent-32, score-0.06]
</p><p>17 T1: Research shows that drivers speaking on a mobile phone have much slower reactions in braking tests than non-users, and are worse even than if they have been drinking. [sent-35, score-0.079]
</p><p>18 T2: Regulation could negate the safety benefits of having a phone in the car. [sent-38, score-0.169]
</p><p>19 When you ’re stuck in traffic, calling  to say you ’ll be late can reduce stress and make you less inclined to drive aggressively to make up lost time. [sent-39, score-0.122]

</p><p>21 As introduced before, our paper proposes an approach to support the participants in forums or debates to detect the accepted arguments among those expressed by the other participants on a certain topic. [sent-44, score-1.341]
</p><p>22 As a first step, we need to (i) automatically recognize a participant’s opinion on a certain topic as an argument, as well as to (ii) detect its relationship with the other arguments. [sent-45, score-0.082]
</p><p>23 We therefore cast the described problem as a TE problem, where the T-H pair is a pair of arguments expressed by two different participants on a certain topic. [sent-46, score-0.576]
</p><p>24 For instance, given the argument “The use of cell-phones while driving is a public hazard” (that we consider as H as a starting point), participants can support it expressing arguments from which H can be inferred (Example 1), or can contradict such argument with opinions against it (Example 2). [sent-47, score-1.097]
</p><p>25 Since in debates  arguments come one after the other, we extract and compare them both with respect to the main issue, and with the other participants’ arguments (when the new argument entails or contradicts one of the arguments previously expressed by another participant). [sent-48, score-1.679]
</p><p>26 For instance, given the same debate as before, a new argument T3 may be expressed by a third participant with the goal of contradicting T2 (that becomes the new H (H1) in the pair), as shown in Example 3. [sent-49, score-0.476]
</p><p>27 T3: If one is late, there is little difference in apologizing while in their car over a cell phone and apologizing in front of their boss at the office. [sent-51, score-0.316]
</p><p>28 So, they should have the restraint to drive at the speed limit, arriving late, and being willing to apologize then; an apologetic cell phone call in a car to a boss shouldn ’t be the cause of one being able to then relax, slow-down, and drive the speed-limit. [sent-52, score-0.304]
</p><p>29 T2 → H1: Regulation could negate the safety benefits of having a phone ilna tthioen car. [sent-53, score-0.169]
</p><p>30 ]fi TE provides us with the techniques to detect both the arguments in a debate, and the kind of relation underlying each couple of arguments. [sent-57, score-0.618]
</p><p>31 The TE system returns indeed a judgment (entailment or con-  tradiction) on the arguments’ pairs, that are used as input to build the argumentation framework, as described in the next Section. [sent-58, score-0.397]
</p><p>32 209 3  Second step: argumentation theory  Starting from a set of arguments and the attacks (i. [sent-59, score-1.118]
</p><p>33 , conflicts) among them, a (Dung, 1995)-style argumentation framework allows to detect which are the accepted arguments. [sent-61, score-0.777]
</p><p>34 Such arguments are considered as believable by an external evaluator who has a full knowledge of the argumentation framework, and they are determined through the acceptability semantics (Dung, 1995). [sent-62, score-0.971]
</p><p>35 Roughly, an argument is accepted, if all the arguments attacking it are rejected, and it is rejected if it has at least an argument attacking it which is accepted. [sent-63, score-0.849]
</p><p>36 An argument which is not attacked at all is accepted. [sent-64, score-0.203]
</p><p>37 An abstract argumentationframework (AF) is a pair hA, →i where A is a set of arguments and →⊆ iAs ×a Aai irs h a binary rheelraeti Aon i csa all seedt aoftta arckg. [sent-66, score-0.417]
</p><p>38 u Aim of the argumentation-based reasoning step is to provide the participant with a complete view on  the arguments proposed in the debate, and to show which are the accepted ones. [sent-67, score-0.736]
</p><p>39 In our framework, we first map contradiction with the attack relation in abstract argumentation; second, the entailment relation is viewed as a support relation among abstract arguments. [sent-68, score-0.697]
</p><p>40 The support relation (Cayrol and LagasquieSchiex, 2011) may be represented as: (1) a relation among the arguments which does not affect their acceptability, or (2) a relation among the arguments which leads to the introduction of additional attacks. [sent-69, score-1.203]
</p><p>41 Consider a support relation among two arguments, namely Ai and Aj. [sent-70, score-0.164]
</p><p>42 If we choose (1), an attack towards Ai or Aj does not affect the acceptability of Aj or Ai, respectively. [sent-71, score-0.278]
</p><p>43 If we choose (2), we introduce additional attacks, and we have the following two options: [Type 1] Ai supports Aj then Ak attacks Aj, and [Type 2] Ai supports Aj then Ak attacks Ai. [sent-72, score-0.512]
</p><p>44 The attacks of type 1 are due to inference: Ai entails Aj means that Ai is more specific of Aj, thus an attack towards Aj is an attack also towards Ai. [sent-73, score-0.618]
</p><p>45 The attacks of type 2, instead, are more rare, but they may happen in debates: an attack towards the more specific argument Ai is an attack towards the more general argument Aj. [sent-74, score-0.914]
</p><p>46 In Section 4, we will  consider only the introduction of attacks of type 1. [sent-75, score-0.282]
</p><p>47 For Examples 1, 2, and 3, the TE phase returns the following couples: T1 entails H, T2 attacks H, T3 attacks H1 (i. [sent-76, score-0.56]
</p><p>48 The argumentation module maps each element to its corresponding argument: H ≡ A1, T1 ≡ A2, T2 ≡ A3, and T3 ≡ A4 . [sent-79, score-0.463]
</p><p>49 The resulting AF (Figure 1) shows that the accepted arguments are {A1, A2, A4}, meaning that the issue “The use of cell-phones whil}e, driving gist a public hsuaeza“rTd”h (A1) oisf considered as accepted. [sent-80, score-0.801]

</p><p>53 For picture clarity, we introduce type 1attacks only from A11. [sent-87, score-0.026]

</p><p>58 5 Test set pairs concern completely new topics, never seen by the system. [sent-99, score-0.028]
</p><p>59 To detect which kind of relation underlies each couple of arguments, we used the EDITS system (Edit Distance Textual Entailment Suite), an open-source software package for recognizing TE6 (Kouylekov and Negri, 2010). [sent-101, score-0.24]
</p><p>60 EDITS implements a distance-based framework which assumes that the probability of an entailment relation between a given T-H pair is inversely proportional  to the distance between T and H. [sent-102, score-0.386]

</p><p>67 , how much a wrong assignment of a relation to a pair of arguments affects the computation of the set of accepted arguments. [sent-124, score-0.74]
</p><p>68 We identify the accepted arguments both in the correct AF of each Debatepedia debate of the data set (the goldstandard, where relations are correctly assigned), and on the AF generated basing on the relations assigned by EDITS. [sent-125, score-0.842]
</p><p>69 Our combined approach ob-  tained the following performances: precision 0. [sent-126, score-0.024]

<p>Author: Ivan Titov ; Alexandre Klementiev</p><p>Abstract: We argue that multilingual parallel data provides a valuable source of indirect supervision for induction of shallow semantic representations. Specifically, we consider unsupervised induction of semantic roles from sentences annotated with automatically-predicted syntactic dependency representations and use a stateof-the-art generative Bayesian non-parametric model. At inference time, instead of only seeking the model which explains the monolingual data available for each language, we regularize the objective by introducing a soft constraint penalizing for disagreement in argument labeling on aligned sentences. We propose a simple approximate learning algorithm for our set-up which results in efficient inference. When applied to German-English parallel data, our method obtains a substantial improvement over a model trained without using the agreement signal, when both are tested on non-parallel sentences.</p><p>3 0.15143356 <a title="53-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Modeling_the_Translation_of_Predicate-Argument_Structure_for_SMT.html">147 acl-2012-Modeling the Translation of Predicate-Argument Structure for SMT</a></p>
<p>Author: Deyi Xiong ; Min Zhang ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: Predicate-argument structure contains rich semantic information of which statistical machine translation hasn’t taken full advantage. In this paper, we propose two discriminative, feature-based models to exploit predicateargument structures for statistical machine translation: 1) a predicate translation model and 2) an argument reordering model. The predicate translation model explores lexical and semantic contexts surrounding a verbal predicate to select desirable translations for the predicate. The argument reordering model automatically predicts the moving direction of an argument relative to its predicate after translation using semantic features. The two models are integrated into a state-of-theart phrase-based machine translation system and evaluated on Chinese-to-English transla- , tion tasks with large-scale training data. Experimental results demonstrate that the two models significantly improve translation accuracy.</p><p>4 0.12664238 <a title="53-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Entailment-based_Text_Exploration_with_Application_to_the_Health-care_Domain.html">82 acl-2012-Entailment-based Text Exploration with Application to the Health-care Domain</a></p>

As a prominent use case, we apply our exploration system and illustrate its benefit on the health-care domain.

<p>Author: Meni Adler ; Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel text exploration model, which extends the scope of state-of-the-art technologies by moving from standard concept-based exploration to statement-based exploration. The proposed scheme utilizes the textual entailment relation between statements as the basis of the exploration process. A user of our system can explore the result space of a query by drilling down/up from one statement to another, according to entailment relations specified by an entailment graph and an optional concept taxonomy. As a prominent use case, we apply our exploration system and illustrate its benefit on the health-care domain. To the best of our knowledge this is the first implementation of an exploration system at the statement level that is based on the textual entailment relation. 1</p><p>3 0.58000386 <a title="53-lsi-3" href="./acl-2012-Detecting_Semantic_Equivalence_and_Information_Disparity_in_Cross-lingual_Documents.html">72 acl-2012-Detecting Semantic Equivalence and Information Disparity in Cross-lingual Documents</a></p>
<p>Author: Yashar Mehdad ; Matteo Negri ; Marcello Federico</p><p>Abstract: We address a core aspect of the multilingual content synchronization task: the identification of novel, more informative or semantically equivalent pieces of information in two documents about the same topic. This can be seen as an application-oriented variant of textual entailment recognition where: i) T and H are in different languages, and ii) entailment relations between T and H have to be checked in both directions. Using a combination of lexical, syntactic, and semantic features to train a cross-lingual textual entailment system, we report promising results on different datasets.</p><p>4 0.54584217 <a title="53-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-Crosslingual_Induction_of_Semantic_Roles.html">64 acl-2012-Crosslingual Induction of Semantic Roles</a></p>
<p>Author: Ivan Titov ; Alexandre Klementiev</p><p>Abstract: We argue that multilingual parallel data provides a valuable source of indirect supervision for induction of shallow semantic representations. Specifically, we consider unsupervised induction of semantic roles from sentences annotated with automatically-predicted syntactic dependency representations and use a stateof-the-art generative Bayesian non-parametric model. At inference time, instead of only seeking the model which explains the monolingual data available for each language, we regularize the objective by introducing a soft constraint penalizing for disagreement in argument labeling on aligned sentences. We propose a simple approximate learning algorithm for our set-up which results in efficient inference. When applied to German-English parallel data, our method obtains a substantial improvement over a model trained without using the agreement signal, when both are tested on non-parallel sentences.</p><p>5 0.48531404 <a title="53-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-Efficient_Tree-based_Approximation_for_Entailment_Graph_Learning.html">80 acl-2012-Efficient Tree-based Approximation for Entailment Graph Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan ; Meni Adler ; Jacob Goldberger</p><p>Abstract: Learning entailment rules is fundamental in many semantic-inference applications and has been an active field of research in recent years. In this paper we address the problem of learning transitive graphs that describe entailment rules between predicates (termed entailment graphs). We first identify that entailment graphs exhibit a “tree-like” property and are very similar to a novel type of graph termed forest-reducible graph. We utilize this property to develop an iterative efficient approximation algorithm for learning the graph edges, where each iteration takes linear time. We compare our approximation algorithm to a recently-proposed state-of-the-art exact algorithm and show that it is more efficient and scalable both theoretically and empirically, while its output quality is close to that given by the optimal solution of the exact algorithm.</p><p>6 0.44647688 <a title="53-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-Modeling_the_Translation_of_Predicate-Argument_Structure_for_SMT.html">147 acl-2012-Modeling the Translation of Predicate-Argument Structure for SMT</a></p>

<p>Author: Shingo Takamatsu ; Issei Sato ; Hiroshi Nakagawa</p><p>Abstract: In relation extraction, distant supervision seeks to extract relations between entities from text by using a knowledge base, such as Freebase, as a source of supervision. When a sentence and a knowledge base refer to the same entity pair, this approach heuristically labels the sentence with the corresponding relation in the knowledge base. However, this heuristic can fail with the result that some sentences are labeled wrongly. This noisy labeled data causes poor extraction performance. In this paper, we propose a method to reduce the number of wrong labels. We present a novel generative model that directly models the heuristic labeling process of distant supervision. The model predicts whether assigned labels are correct or wrong via its hidden variables. Our experimental results show that this model detected wrong labels with higher performance than baseline methods. In the ex- periment, we also found that our wrong label reduction boosted the performance of relation extraction.</p><p>2 0.97113508 <a title="53-lda-2" href="./acl-2012-Named_Entity_Disambiguation_in_Streaming_Data.html">153 acl-2012-Named Entity Disambiguation in Streaming Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexandre Davis ; Adriano Veloso ; Altigran Soares ; Alberto Laender ; Wagner Meira Jr.</p><p>Abstract: The named entity disambiguation task is to resolve the many-to-many correspondence between ambiguous names and the unique realworld entity. This task can be modeled as a classification problem, provided that positive and negative examples are available for learning binary classifiers. High-quality senseannotated data, however, are hard to be obtained in streaming environments, since the training corpus would have to be constantly updated in order to accomodate the fresh data coming on the stream. On the other hand, few positive examples plus large amounts of unlabeled data may be easily acquired. Producing binary classifiers directly from this data, however, leads to poor disambiguation performance. Thus, we propose to enhance the quality of the classifiers using finer-grained variations of the well-known ExpectationMaximization (EM) algorithm. We conducted a systematic evaluation using Twitter streaming data and the results show that our classifiers are extremely effective, providing improvements ranging from 1% to 20%, when compared to the current state-of-the-art biased SVMs, being more than 120 times faster.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.9407357 <a title="53-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Combining_Textual_Entailment_and_Argumentation_Theory_for_Supporting_Online_Debates_Interactions.html">53 acl-2012-Combining Textual Entailment and Argumentation Theory for Supporting Online Debates Interactions</a></p>

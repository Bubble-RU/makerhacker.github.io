<p>Author: Eric Xing</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic topic models have recently gained much popularity in informational retrieval and related areas. Via such models, one can project high-dimensional objects such as text documents into a low dimensional space where their latent semantics are captured and modeled; can integrate multiple sources of information—to ”share statistical strength” among components of a hierarchical probabilistic model; and can structurally display and classify the otherwise unstructured object collections. However, to many practitioners, how topic models work, what to and not to expect from a topic model, how is it different from and related to classical matrix algebraic techniques such as LSI, NMF in NLP, how to empower topic models to deal with complex scenarios such as multimodal data, contractual text in social media, evolving corpus, or presence of supervision such as labeling and rating, how to make topic modeling computationally tractable even on webscale data, etc., in a principled way, remain unclear. In this tutorial, I will demystify the conceptual, mathematical, and computational issues behind all such problems surrounding the topic models and their applications by presenting a systematic overview of the mathematical foundation of topic modeling, and its connections to a number of related methods popular in other fields such as the LDA, admixture model, mixed membership model, latent space models, and sparse coding. Iwill offer a simple and unifying view of all these techniques under the framework multi-view latent space embedding, and online the roadmap of model extension and algorithmic design to3 ward different applications in IR and NLP. A main theme of this tutorial that tie together a wide range of issues and problems will build on the ”probabilistic graphical model” formalism, a formalism that exploits the conjoined talents of graph theory and probability theory to build complex models out of simpler pieces. Iwill use this formalism as a main aid to discuss both the mathematical underpinnings for the models and the related computational issues in a unified, simplistic, transparent, and actionable fashion.

<p>Author: Elia Bruni ; Gemma Boleda ; Marco Baroni ; Nam Khanh Tran</p><p>Abstract: Our research aims at building computational models of word meaning that are perceptually grounded. Using computer vision techniques, we build visual and multimodal distributional models and compare them to standard textual models. Our results show that, while visual models with state-of-the-art computer vision techniques perform worse than textual models in general tasks (accounting for semantic relatedness), they are as good or better models of the meaning of words with visual correlates such as color terms, even in a nontrivial task that involves nonliteral uses of such words. Moreover, we show that visual and textual information are tapping on different aspects of meaning, and indeed combining them in multimodal models often improves performance.</p><p>6 0.059618577 <a title="166-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Graph-based_Semi-Supervised_Learning_Algorithms_for_NLP.html">104 acl-2012-Graph-based Semi-Supervised Learning Algorithms for NLP</a></p>

<p>Author: Amar Subramanya ; Partha Pratim Talukdar</p><p>Abstract: While labeled data is expensive to prepare, ever increasing amounts of unlabeled linguistic data are becoming widely available. In order to adapt to this phenomenon, several semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms, which learn from labeled as well as unlabeled data, have been developed. In a separate line of work, researchers have started to realize that graphs provide a natural way to represent data in a variety of domains. Graph-based SSL algorithms, which bring together these two lines of work, have been shown to outperform the state-ofthe-art in many applications in speech processing, computer vision and NLP. In particular, recent NLP research has successfully used graph-based SSL algorithms for PoS tagging (Subramanya et al., 2010), semantic parsing (Das and Smith, 2011), knowledge acquisition (Talukdar et al., 2008), sentiment analysis (Goldberg and Zhu, 2006) and text categoriza- tion (Subramanya and Bilmes, 2008). Recognizing this promising and emerging area of research, this tutorial focuses on graph-based SSL algorithms (e.g., label propagation methods). The tutorial is intended to be a sequel to the ACL 2008 SSL tutorial, focusing exclusively on graph-based SSL methods and recent advances in this area, which were beyond the scope of the previous tutorial. The tutorial is divided in two parts. In the first part, we will motivate the need for graph-based SSL methods, introduce some standard graph-based SSL algorithms, and discuss connections between these approaches. We will also discuss how linguistic data can be encoded as graphs and show how graph-based algorithms can be scaled to large amounts of data (e.g., web-scale data). Part 2 of the tutorial will focus on how graph-based methods can be used to solve several critical NLP tasks, including basic problems such as PoS tagging, semantic parsing, and more downstream tasks such as text categorization, information acquisition, and 6 Partha Pratim Talukdar Carnegie Mellon University ppt @ cs . cmu . edu sentiment analysis. We will conclude the tutorial with some exciting avenues for future work. Familiarity with semi-supervised learning and graph-based methods will not be assumed, and the necessary background will be provided. Examples from NLP tasks will be used throughout the tutorial to convey the necessary concepts. At the end of this tutorial, the attendee will walk away with the following: • An in-depth knowledge of the current state-oftAhen- ainrt-d dienp graph-based SeS oLf algorithms, taantde- tohfeability to implement them. • The ability to decide on the suitability of graph-based S toSL d meceitdheod osn nfo trh a problem. • Familiarity with different NLP tasks where graph-based wSSitLh m dieftfehorednst h NaLveP Pb teaesnk successfully applied. In addition to the above goals, we hope that this tutorial will better prepare the attendee to conduct exciting research at the intersection of NLP and other emerging areas with natural graph-structured data (e.g., Computation Social Science).

<p>Author: Igor Labutov ; Hod Lipson</p><p>Abstract: This work presents a first step to a general implementation of the Semantic-Script Theory of Humor (SSTH). Of the scarce amount of research in computational humor, no research had focused on humor generation beyond simple puns and punning riddles. We propose an algorithm for mining simple humorous scripts from a semantic network (ConceptNet) by specifically searching for dual scripts that jointly maximize overlap and incongruity metrics in line with Raskin’s Semantic-Script Theory of Humor. Initial results show that a more relaxed constraint of this form is capable of generating humor of deeper semantic content than wordplay riddles. We evaluate the said metrics through a user-assessed quality of the generated two-liners.</p><p>6 0.35516986 <a title="166-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-A_Web-based_Evaluation_Framework_for_Spatial_Instruction-Giving_Systems.html">24 acl-2012-A Web-based Evaluation Framework for Spatial Instruction-Giving Systems</a></p>

The model is novel in that it incorporates entity context, surface features, firstorder dependencies among attribute-parts, and a notion of noise. Transductive learning from a few seeds and a collection of mention tokens combines Bayesian inference and conditional estimation. We evaluate our model and its components on two datasets collected from political blogs and sports news, finding that it outperforms a simple agglomerative clustering approach and previous work.</p><p>4 0.3831329 <a title="166-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-UWN%3A_A_Large_Multilingual_Lexical_Knowledge_Base.html">206 acl-2012-UWN: A Large Multilingual Lexical Knowledge Base</a></p>
<p>Author: Gerard de Melo ; Gerhard Weikum</p><p>Abstract: We present UWN, a large multilingual lexical knowledge base that describes the meanings and relationships of words in over 200 languages. This paper explains how link prediction, information integration and taxonomy induction methods have been used to build UWN based on WordNet and extend it with millions of named entities from Wikipedia. We additionally introduce extensions to cover lexical relationships, frame-semantic knowledge, and language data. An online interface provides human access to the data, while a software API enables applications to look up over 16 million words and names.</p><p>5 0.37192628 <a title="166-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Deep_Learning_for_NLP_%28without_Magic%29.html">69 acl-2012-Deep Learning for NLP (without Magic)</a></p>

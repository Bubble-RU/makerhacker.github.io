<p>Author: Patrick Pantel ; Thomas Lin ; Michael Gamon</p><p>Abstract: We predict entity type distributions in Web search queries via probabilistic inference in graphical models that capture how entitybearing queries are generated. We jointly model the interplay between latent user intents that govern queries and unobserved entity types, leveraging observed signals from query formulations and document clicks. We apply the models to resolve entity types in new queries and to assign prior type distributions over an existing knowledge base. Our models are efficiently trained using maximum likelihood estimation over millions of real-world Web search queries. We show that modeling user intent significantly improves entity type resolution for head queries over the state ofthe art, on several metrics, without degradation in tail query performance.</p><p>5 0.21688864 <a title="217-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Unsupervised_Relation_Discovery_with_Sense_Disambiguation.html">208 acl-2012-Unsupervised Relation Discovery with Sense Disambiguation</a></p>
<p>Author: Limin Yao ; Sebastian Riedel ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: To discover relation types from text, most methods cluster shallow or syntactic patterns of relation mentions, but consider only one possible sense per pattern. In practice this assumption is often violated. In this paper we overcome this issue by inducing clusters of pattern senses from feature representations of patterns. In particular, we employ a topic model to partition entity pairs associated with patterns into sense clusters using local and global features. We merge these sense clusters into semantic relations using hierarchical agglomerative clustering. We compare against several baselines: a generative latent-variable model, a clustering method that does not disambiguate between path senses, and our own approach but with only local features. Experimental results show our proposed approach discovers dramatically more accurate clusters than models without sense disambiguation, and that incorporating global features, such as the document theme, is crucial.</p><p>6 0.18873839 <a title="217-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Using_Search-Logs_to_Improve_Query_Tagging.html">212 acl-2012-Using Search-Logs to Improve Query Tagging</a></p>

<p>Author: Meni Adler ; Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel text exploration model, which extends the scope of state-of-the-art technologies by moving from standard concept-based exploration to statement-based exploration. The proposed scheme utilizes the textual entailment relation between statements as the basis of the exploration process. A user of our system can explore the result space of a query by drilling down/up from one statement to another, according to entailment relations specified by an entailment graph and an optional concept taxonomy. As a prominent use case, we apply our exploration system and illustrate its benefit on the health-care domain. To the best of our knowledge this is the first implementation of an exploration system at the statement level that is based on the textual entailment relation. 1</p><p>3 0.96264291 <a title="217-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Deciphering_Foreign_Language_by_Combining_Language_Models_and_Context_Vectors.html">67 acl-2012-Deciphering Foreign Language by Combining Language Models and Context Vectors</a></p>

We present a modification of the method shown in (Ravi and Knight, 2011) that is scalable to vocabulary sizes of several thousand words. On the task shown in (Ravi and Knight, 2011) we obtain better results with only 5% of the computational effort when running our method with an n-gram language model. The efficiency improvement of our method allows us to run experiments with vocabulary sizes of around 5,000 words, such as a non-parallel version of the VERBMOBIL corpus. We also report results using data from the monolingual French and English GIGAWORD corpora.</p><p>4 0.94775146 <a title="217-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Building_Trainable_Taggers_in_a_Web-based%2C_UIMA-Supported_NLP_Workbench.html">43 acl-2012-Building Trainable Taggers in a Web-based, UIMA-Supported NLP Workbench</a></p>
<p>Author: Rafal Rak ; BalaKrishna Kolluru ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: Argo is a web-based NLP and text mining workbench with a convenient graphical user interface for designing and executing processing workflows of various complexity. The workbench is intended for specialists and nontechnical audiences alike, and provides the ever expanding library of analytics compliant with the Unstructured Information Management Architecture, a widely adopted interoperability framework. We explore the flexibility of this framework by demonstrating workflows involving three processing components capable of performing self-contained machine learning-based tagging. The three components are responsible for the three distinct tasks of 1) generating observations or features, 2) training a statistical model based on the generated features, and 3) tagging unlabelled data with the model. The learning and tagging components are based on an implementation of conditional random fields (CRF); whereas the feature generation component is an analytic capable of extending basic token information to a comprehensive set of features. Users define the features of their choice directly from Argo’s graphical interface, without resorting to programming (a commonly used approach to feature engineering). The experimental results performed on two tagging tasks, chunking and named entity recognition, showed that a tagger with a generic set of features built in Argo is capable of competing with taskspecific solutions. 121</p><p>same-paper 5 0.87544644 <a title="217-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Word_Sense_Disambiguation_Improves_Information_Retrieval.html">217 acl-2012-Word Sense Disambiguation Improves Information Retrieval</a></p>

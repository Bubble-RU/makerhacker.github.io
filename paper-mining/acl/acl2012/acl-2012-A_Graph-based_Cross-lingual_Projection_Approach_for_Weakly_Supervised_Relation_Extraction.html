This paper introduces a novel variant of the Yarowsky algorithm based on this view. It is a bootstrapping learning method which uses a graph propagation algorithm with a well defined objective function.

<p>Author: Ashish Vaswani ; Liang Huang ; David Chiang</p><p>Abstract: Two decades after their invention, the IBM word-based translation models, widely available in the GIZA++ toolkit, remain the dominant approach to word alignment and an integral part of many statistical translation systems. Although many models have surpassed them in accuracy, none have supplanted them in practice. In this paper, we propose a simple extension to the IBM models: an â€˜0 prior to encourage sparsity in the word-to-word translation model. We explain how to implement this extension efficiently for large-scale data (also released as a modification to GIZA++) and demonstrate, in experiments on Czech, Arabic, Chinese, and Urdu to English translation, significant improvements over IBM Model 4 in both word alignment (up to +6.7 F1) and translation quality (up to +1.4 B ).</p><p>6 0.10593091 <a title="12-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-ACCURAT_Toolkit_for_Multi-Level_Alignment_and_Information_Extraction_from_Comparable_Corpora.html">1 acl-2012-ACCURAT Toolkit for Multi-Level Alignment and Information Extraction from Comparable Corpora</a></p>

<p>Author: Tahira Naseem ; Regina Barzilay ; Amir Globerson</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel algorithm for multilingual dependency parsing that uses annotations from a diverse set of source languages to parse a new unannotated language. Our motivation is to broaden the advantages of multilingual learning to languages that exhibit significant differences from existing resource-rich languages. The algorithm learns which aspects of the source languages are relevant for the target language and ties model parameters accordingly. The model factorizes the process of generating a dependency tree into two steps: selection of syntactic dependents and their ordering. Being largely languageuniversal, the selection component is learned in a supervised fashion from all the training languages. In contrast, the ordering decisions are only influenced by languages with similar properties. We systematically model this cross-lingual sharing using typological features. In our experiments, the model consistently outperforms a state-of-the-art multilingual parser. The largest improvement is achieved on the non Indo-European languages yielding a gain of 14.4%.1</p><p>6 0.47642204 <a title="12-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-Coarse_Lexical_Semantic_Annotation_with_Supersenses%3A_An_Arabic_Case_Study.html">49 acl-2012-Coarse Lexical Semantic Annotation with Supersenses: An Arabic Case Study</a></p>

<p>Author: Boxing Chen ; Roland Kuhn ; Samuel Larkin</p><p>Abstract: Many machine translation (MT) evaluation metrics have been shown to correlate better with human judgment than BLEU. In principle, tuning on these metrics should yield better systems than tuning on BLEU. However, due to issues such as speed, requirements for linguistic resources, and optimization difficulty, they have not been widely adopted for tuning. This paper presents PORT , a new MT evaluation metric which combines precision, recall and an ordering metric and which is primarily designed for tuning MT systems. PORT does not require external resources and is quick to compute. It has a better correlation with human judgment than BLEU. We compare PORT-tuned MT systems to BLEU-tuned baselines in five experimental conditions involving four language pairs. PORT tuning achieves 1 consistently better performance than BLEU tuning, according to four automated metrics (including BLEU) and to human evaluation: in comparisons of outputs from 300 source sentences, human judges preferred the PORT-tuned output 45.3% of the time (vs. 32.7% BLEU tuning preferences and 22.0% ties). 1</p><p>3 0.84274143 <a title="12-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Fast_Online_Lexicon_Learning_for_Grounded_Language_Acquisition.html">93 acl-2012-Fast Online Lexicon Learning for Grounded Language Acquisition</a></p>
<p>Author: David Chen</p><p>Abstract: Learning a semantic lexicon is often an important first step in building a system that learns to interpret the meaning of natural language. It is especially important in language grounding where the training data usually consist of language paired with an ambiguous perceptual context. Recent work by Chen and Mooney (201 1) introduced a lexicon learning method that deals with ambiguous relational data by taking intersections of graphs. While the algorithm produced good lexicons for the task of learning to interpret navigation instructions, it only works in batch settings and does not scale well to large datasets. In this paper we introduce a new online algorithm that is an order of magnitude faster and surpasses the stateof-the-art results. We show that by changing the grammar of the formal meaning represen- . tation language and training on additional data collected from Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk we can further improve the results. We also include experimental results on a Chinese translation of the training data to demonstrate the generality of our approach.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.83784586 <a title="12-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-A_Graph-based_Cross-lingual_Projection_Approach_for_Weakly_Supervised_Relation_Extraction.html">12 acl-2012-A Graph-based Cross-lingual Projection Approach for Weakly Supervised Relation Extraction</a></p>

<p>Author: Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Pradeep Dasigi ; Mona Diab ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: The rapid and continuous growth of social networking sites has led to the emergence of many communities of communicating groups. Many of these groups discuss ideological and political topics. It is not uncommon that the participants in such discussions split into two or more subgroups. The members of each subgroup share the same opinion toward the discussion topic and are more likely to agree with members of the same subgroup and disagree with members from opposing subgroups. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach for automatically detecting discussant subgroups in online communities. We analyze the text exchanged between the participants of a discussion to identify the attitude they carry toward each other and towards the various aspects of the discussion topic. We use attitude predictions to construct an attitude vector for each discussant. We use clustering techniques to cluster these vectors and, hence, determine the subgroup membership of each participant. We compare our methods to text clustering and other baselines, and show that our method achieves promising results.</p><p>6 0.70516473 <a title="12-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Corpus-based_Interpretation_of_Instructions_in_Virtual_Environments.html">59 acl-2012-Corpus-based Interpretation of Instructions in Virtual Environments</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiao Chen ; Chunyu Kit</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a higher-order model for constituent parsing aimed at utilizing more local structural context to decide the score of a grammar rule instance in a parse tree. Experiments on English and Chinese treebanks confirm its advantage over its first-order version. It achieves its best F1 scores of 91.86% and 85.58% on the two languages, respectively, and further pushes them to 92.80% and 85.60% via combination with other highperformance parsers.</p><p>3 0.15750131 <a title="175-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Head-driven_Transition-based_Parsing_with_Top-down_Prediction.html">106 acl-2012-Head-driven Transition-based Parsing with Top-down Prediction</a></p>

<p>Author: Lea Frermann ; Francis Bond</p><p>Abstract: We present a system for cross-lingual parse disambiguation, exploiting the assumption that the meaning of a sentence remains unchanged during translation and the fact that different languages have different ambiguities. We simultaneously reduce ambiguity in multiple languages in a fully automatic way. Evaluation shows that the system reliably discards dispreferred parses from the raw parser output, which results in a pre-selection that can speed up manual treebanking.</p><p>5 0.1481714 <a title="175-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-A_Comparison_of_Chinese_Parsers_for_Stanford_Dependencies.html">5 acl-2012-A Comparison of Chinese Parsers for Stanford Dependencies</a></p>
<p>Author: Wanxiang Che ; Valentin Spitkovsky ; Ting Liu</p><p>Abstract: Stanford dependencies are widely used in natural language processing as a semanticallyoriented representation, commonly generated either by (i) converting the output of a constituent parser, or (ii) predicting dependencies directly. Previous comparisons of the two approaches for English suggest that starting from constituents yields higher accuracies. In this paper, we re-evaluate both methods for Chinese, using more accurate dependency parsers than in previous work. Our comparison of performance and efficiency across seven popular open source parsers (four constituent and three dependency) shows, by contrast, that recent higher-order graph-based techniques can be more accurate, though somewhat slower, than constituent parsers. We demonstrate also that n-way jackknifing is a useful technique for producing automatic (rather than gold) partof-speech tags to train Chinese dependency parsers. Finally, we analyze the relations produced by both kinds of parsing and suggest which specific parsers to use in practice.</p><p>6 0.14382637 <a title="175-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Utilizing_Dependency_Language_Models_for_Graph-based_Dependency_Parsing_Models.html">213 acl-2012-Utilizing Dependency Language Models for Graph-based Dependency Parsing Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Emily Pitler</p><p>Abstract: Prepositions and conjunctions are two of the largest remaining bottlenecks in parsing. Across various existing parsers, these two categories have the lowest accuracies, and mistakes made have consequences for downstream applications. Prepositions and conjunctions are often assumed to depend on lexical dependencies for correct resolution. As lexical statistics based on the training set only are sparse, unlabeled data can help ameliorate this sparsity problem. By including unlabeled data features into a factorization of the problem which matches the representation of prepositions and conjunctions, we achieve a new state-of-the-art for English dependencies with 93.55% correct attachments on the current standard. Furthermore, conjunctions are attached with an accuracy of 90.8%, and prepositions with an accuracy of 87.4%.</p><p>3 0.78164381 <a title="175-lsi-3" href="./acl-2012-Head-driven_Transition-based_Parsing_with_Top-down_Prediction.html">106 acl-2012-Head-driven Transition-based Parsing with Top-down Prediction</a></p>

<p>Author: Wenliang Chen ; Min Zhang ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: Most previous graph-based parsing models increase decoding complexity when they use high-order features due to exact-inference decoding. In this paper, we present an approach to enriching high-orderfeature representations for graph-based dependency parsing models using a dependency language model and beam search. The dependency language model is built on a large-amount of additional autoparsed data that is processed by a baseline parser. Based on the dependency language model, we represent a set of features for the parsing model. Finally, the features are efficiently integrated into the parsing model during decoding using beam search. Our approach has two advantages. Firstly we utilize rich high-order features defined over a view of large scope and additional large raw corpus. Secondly our approach does not increase the decoding complexity. We evaluate the proposed approach on English and Chinese data. The experimental results show that our new parser achieves the best accuracy on the Chinese data and comparable accuracy with the best known systems on the English data.</p><p>5 0.76994443 <a title="175-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-A_Comparison_of_Chinese_Parsers_for_Stanford_Dependencies.html">5 acl-2012-A Comparison of Chinese Parsers for Stanford Dependencies</a></p>

<p>Author: Thomas Lippincott ; Anna Korhonen ; Diarmuid O Seaghdha</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach for verb subcategorization lexicons using a simple graphical model. In contrast to previous methods, we show how the model can be trained without parsed input or a predefined subcategorization frame inventory. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on a verb clustering task, and is easily trained on arbitrary domains. This quantitative evaluation is com- plemented by a qualitative discussion of verbs and their frames. We discuss the advantages of graphical models for this task, in particular the ease of integrating semantic information about verbs and arguments in a principled fashion. We conclude with future work to augment the approach.</p><p>2 0.73311049 <a title="175-lda-2" href="./acl-2012-Identifying_High-Impact_Sub-Structures_for_Convolution_Kernels_in_Document-level_Sentiment_Classification.html">115 acl-2012-Identifying High-Impact Sub-Structures for Convolution Kernels in Document-level Sentiment Classification</a></p>

However, such models are highly sensitive to the type and size of syntactic structure used. It is therefore an important challenge to automatically identify high impact sub-structures relevant to a given task.

Chou</p><p>Abstract: Social Event Radar is a new social networking-based service platform, that aim to alert as well as monitor any merchandise flaws, food-safety related issues, unexpected eruption of diseases or campaign issues towards to the Government, enterprises of any kind or election parties, through keyword expansion detection module, using bilingual sentiment opinion analysis tool kit to conclude the specific event social dashboard and deliver the outcome helping authorities to plan “risk control” strategy. With the rapid development of social network, people can now easily publish their opinions on the Internet. On the other hand, people can also obtain various opinions from others in a few seconds even though they do not know each other. A typical approach to obtain required information is to use a search engine with some relevant keywords. We thus take the social media and forum as our major data source and aim at collecting specific issues efficiently and effectively in this work. 163 Chen-Ming Wu Institute for Information Industry cmwu@ i i i .org .tw Seng-cho T.

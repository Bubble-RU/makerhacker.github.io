<p>Author: Asher Stern ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces BIUTEE1 , an opensource system for recognizing textual entailment. Its main advantages are its ability to utilize various types of knowledge resources, and its extensibility by which new knowledge resources and inference components can be easily integrated. These abilities make BIUTEE an appealing RTE system for two research communities: (1) researchers of end applications, that can benefit from generic textual inference, and (2) RTE researchers, who can integrate their novel algorithms and knowledge resources into our system, saving the time and effort of developing a complete RTE system from scratch. Notable assistance for these re- searchers is provided by a visual tracing tool, by which researchers can refine and “debug” their knowledge resources and inference components.</p><p>6 0.14700986 <a title="82-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Combining_Textual_Entailment_and_Argumentation_Theory_for_Supporting_Online_Debates_Interactions.html">53 acl-2012-Combining Textual Entailment and Argumentation Theory for Supporting Online Debates Interactions</a></p>

<p>Author: Rafal Rak ; BalaKrishna Kolluru ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: Argo is a web-based NLP and text mining workbench with a convenient graphical user interface for designing and executing processing workflows of various complexity. The workbench is intended for specialists and nontechnical audiences alike, and provides the ever expanding library of analytics compliant with the Unstructured Information Management Architecture, a widely adopted interoperability framework. We explore the flexibility of this framework by demonstrating workflows involving three processing components capable of performing self-contained machine learning-based tagging. The three components are responsible for the three distinct tasks of 1) generating observations or features, 2) training a statistical model based on the generated features, and 3) tagging unlabelled data with the model. The learning and tagging components are based on an implementation of conditional random fields (CRF); whereas the feature generation component is an analytic capable of extending basic token information to a comprehensive set of features. Users define the features of their choice directly from Argo’s graphical interface, without resorting to programming (a commonly used approach to feature engineering). The experimental results performed on two tagging tasks, chunking and named entity recognition, showed that a tagger with a generic set of features built in Argo is capable of competing with taskspecific solutions. 121</p><p>4 0.89995503 <a title="82-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Deciphering_Foreign_Language_by_Combining_Language_Models_and_Context_Vectors.html">67 acl-2012-Deciphering Foreign Language by Combining Language Models and Context Vectors</a></p>
<p>Author: Malte Nuhn ; Arne Mauser ; Hermann Ney</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we show how to train statistical machine translation systems on reallife tasks using only non-parallel monolingual data from two languages. We present a modification of the method shown in (Ravi and Knight, 2011) that is scalable to vocabulary sizes of several thousand words. On the task shown in (Ravi and Knight, 2011) we obtain better results with only 5% of the computational effort when running our method with an n-gram language model. The efficiency improvement of our method allows us to run experiments with vocabulary sizes of around 5,000 words, such as a non-parallel version of the VERBMOBIL corpus. We also report results using data from the monolingual French and English GIGAWORD corpora.</p><p>5 0.78085905 <a title="82-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Efficient_Tree-based_Approximation_for_Entailment_Graph_Learning.html">80 acl-2012-Efficient Tree-based Approximation for Entailment Graph Learning</a></p>

We first identify that entailment graphs exhibit a “tree-like” property and are very similar to a novel type of graph termed forest-reducible graph. We utilize this property to develop an iterative efficient approximation algorithm for learning the graph edges, where each iteration takes linear time. We compare our approximation algorithm to a recently-proposed state-of-the-art exact algorithm and show that it is more efficient and scalable both theoretically and empirically, while its output quality is close to that given by the optimal solution of the exact algorithm.</p><p>6 0.77127171 <a title="82-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Word_Sense_Disambiguation_Improves_Information_Retrieval.html">217 acl-2012-Word Sense Disambiguation Improves Information Retrieval</a></p>

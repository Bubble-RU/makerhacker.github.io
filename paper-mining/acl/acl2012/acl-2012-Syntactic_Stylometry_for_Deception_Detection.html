<p>Author: Arjun Mukherjee ; Bing Liu</p><p>Abstract: Writing comments about news articles, blogs, or reviews have become a popular activity in social media. In this paper, we analyze reader comments about reviews. Analyzing review comments is important because reviews only tell the experiences and evaluations of reviewers about the reviewed products or services. Comments, on the other hand, are readers’ evaluations of reviews, their questions and concerns. Clearly, the information in comments is valuable for both future readers and brands. This paper proposes two latent variable models to simultaneously model and extract these key pieces of information. The results also enable classification of comments accurately. Experiments using Amazon review comments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models.</p><p>4 0.083719157 <a title="190-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Tense_and_Aspect_Error_Correction_for_ESL_Learners_Using_Global_Context.html">192 acl-2012-Tense and Aspect Error Correction for ESL Learners Using Global Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Toshikazu Tajiri ; Mamoru Komachi ; Yuji Matsumoto</p><p>Abstract: As the number of learners of English is constantly growing, automatic error correction of ESL learners’ writing is an increasingly active area of research. However, most research has mainly focused on errors concerning articles and prepositions even though tense/aspect errors are also important. One of the main reasons why tense/aspect error correction is difficult is that the choice of tense/aspect is highly dependent on global context. Previous research on grammatical error correction typically uses pointwise prediction that performs classification on each word independently, and thus fails to capture the information of neighboring labels. In order to take global information into account, we regard the task as sequence labeling: each verb phrase in a document is labeled with tense/aspect depending on surrounding labels. Our experiments show that the global context makes a moderate con- tribution to tense/aspect error correction.</p><p>5 0.063962281 <a title="190-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Large-Scale_Syntactic_Language_Modeling_with_Treelets.html">127 acl-2012-Large-Scale Syntactic Language Modeling with Treelets</a></p>
<p>Author: Adam Pauls ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We propose a simple generative, syntactic language model that conditions on overlapping windows of tree context (or treelets) in the same way that n-gram language models condition on overlapping windows of linear context. We estimate the parameters of our model by collecting counts from automatically parsed text using standard n-gram language model estimation techniques, allowing us to train a model on over one billion tokens of data using a single machine in a matter of hours. We evaluate on perplexity and a range of grammaticality tasks, and find that we perform as well or better than n-gram models and other generative baselines. Our model even competes with state-of-the-art discriminative models hand-designed for the grammaticality tasks, despite training on positive data alone. We also show fluency improvements in a preliminary machine translation experiment.</p><p>6 0.050976723 <a title="190-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Spice_it_up%3F_Mining_Refinements_to_Online_Instructions_from_User_Generated_Content.html">182 acl-2012-Spice it up?

<p>Author: Shomir Wilson</p><p>Abstract: Metalanguage is an essential linguistic mechanism which allows us to communicate explicit information about language itself. However, it has been underexamined in research in language technologies, to the detriment of the performance of systems that could exploit it. This paper describes the creation of the first tagged and delineated corpus of English metalanguage, accompanied by an explicit definition and a rubric for identifying the phenomenon in text. This resource will provide a basis for further studies of metalanguage and enable its utilization in language technologies.</p><p>3 0.40584123 <a title="190-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Crosslingual_Induction_of_Semantic_Roles.html">64 acl-2012-Crosslingual Induction of Semantic Roles</a></p>
<p>Author: Ivan Titov ; Alexandre Klementiev</p><p>Abstract: We argue that multilingual parallel data provides a valuable source of indirect supervision for induction of shallow semantic representations. Specifically, we consider unsupervised induction of semantic roles from sentences annotated with automatically-predicted syntactic dependency representations and use a stateof-the-art generative Bayesian non-parametric model. At inference time, instead of only seeking the model which explains the monolingual data available for each language, we regularize the objective by introducing a soft constraint penalizing for disagreement in argument labeling on aligned sentences. We propose a simple approximate learning algorithm for our set-up which results in efficient inference. When applied to German-English parallel data, our method obtains a substantial improvement over a model trained without using the agreement signal, when both are tested on non-parallel sentences.</p><p>4 0.40303993 <a title="190-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-A_System_for_Real-time_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_of_2012_U.S._Presidential_Election_Cycle.html">21 acl-2012-A System for Real-time Twitter Sentiment Analysis of 2012 U.S. Presidential Election Cycle</a></p>
<p>Author: Hao Wang ; Dogan Can ; Abe Kazemzadeh ; Francois Bar ; Shrikanth Narayanan</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a system for real-time analysis of public sentiment toward presidential candidates in the 2012 U.S. election as expressed on Twitter, a microblogging service. Twitter has become a central site where people express their opinions and views on political parties and candidates. Emerging events or news are often followed almost instantly by a burst in Twitter volume, providing a unique opportunity to gauge the relation between expressed public sentiment and electoral events. In addition, sentiment analysis can help explore how these events affect public opinion. While traditional content analysis takes days or weeks to complete, the system demonstrated here analyzes sentiment in the entire Twitter traffic about the election, delivering results instantly and continuously. It offers the public, the media, politicians and scholars a new and timely perspective on the dynamics of the electoral process and public opinion. 1</p><p>5 0.40289378 <a title="190-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Multilingual_Named_Entity_Recognition_using_Parallel_Data_and_Metadata_from_Wikipedia.html">150 acl-2012-Multilingual Named Entity Recognition using Parallel Data and Metadata from Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>Author: Sungchul Kim ; Kristina Toutanova ; Hwanjo Yu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a method to automatically label multi-lingual data with named entity tags. We build on prior work utilizing Wikipedia metadata and show how to effectively combine the weak annotations stemming from Wikipedia metadata with information obtained through English-foreign language parallel Wikipedia sentences. The combination is achieved using a novel semi-CRF model for foreign sentence tagging in the context of a parallel English sentence. The model outperforms both standard annotation projection methods and methods based solely on Wikipedia metadata.</p><p>6 0.4013249 <a title="190-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Verb_Classification_using_Distributional_Similarity_in_Syntactic_and_Semantic_Structures.html">214 acl-2012-Verb Classification using Distributional Similarity in Syntactic and Semantic Structures</a></p>

<p>Author: Patrick Pantel ; Thomas Lin ; Michael Gamon</p><p>Abstract: We predict entity type distributions in Web search queries via probabilistic inference in graphical models that capture how entitybearing queries are generated. We jointly model the interplay between latent user intents that govern queries and unobserved entity types, leveraging observed signals from query formulations and document clicks. We apply the models to resolve entity types in new queries and to assign prior type distributions over an existing knowledge base. Our models are efficiently trained using maximum likelihood estimation over millions of real-world Web search queries. We show that modeling user intent significantly improves entity type resolution for head queries over the state ofthe art, on several metrics, without degradation in tail query performance.</p><p>6 0.12260513 <a title="14-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-A_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Approach_to_Acoustic_Model_Discovery.html">16 acl-2012-A Nonparametric Bayesian Approach to Acoustic Model Discovery</a></p>

<p>Author: Chia-ying Lee ; James Glass</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of acoustic modeling in which prior language-specific knowledge and transcribed data are unavailable. We present an unsupervised model that simultaneously segments the speech, discovers a proper set of sub-word units (e.g., phones) and learns a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for each induced acoustic unit. Our approach is formulated as a Dirichlet process mixture model in which each mixture is an HMM that represents a sub-word unit. We apply our model to the TIMIT corpus, and the results demonstrate that our model discovers sub-word units that are highly correlated with English phones and also produces better segmentation than the state-of-the-art unsupervised baseline. We test the quality of the learned acoustic models on a spoken term detection task. Compared to the baselines, our model improves the relative precision of top hits by at least 22.1% and outper- forms a language-mismatched acoustic model.</p><p>6 0.38425195 <a title="14-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-Mining_Entity_Types_from_Query_Logs_via_User_Intent_Modeling.html">142 acl-2012-Mining Entity Types from Query Logs via User Intent Modeling</a></p>

<p>Author: Ziheng Lin ; Chang Liu ; Hwee Tou Ng ; Min-Yen Kan</p><p>Abstract: An ideal summarization system should produce summaries that have high content coverage and linguistic quality. Many state-ofthe-art summarization systems focus on content coverage by extracting content-dense sentences from source articles. A current research focus is to process these sentences so that they read fluently as a whole. The current AESOP task encourages research on evaluating summaries on content, readability, and overall responsiveness. In this work, we adapt a machine translation metric to measure content coverage, apply an enhanced discourse coherence model to evaluate summary readability, and combine both in a trained regression model to evaluate overall responsiveness. The results show significantly improved performance over AESOP 2011 submitted metrics.</p><p>4 0.44578725 <a title="14-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Unsupervised_Relation_Discovery_with_Sense_Disambiguation.html">208 acl-2012-Unsupervised Relation Discovery with Sense Disambiguation</a></p>
<p>Author: Limin Yao ; Sebastian Riedel ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: To discover relation types from text, most methods cluster shallow or syntactic patterns of relation mentions, but consider only one possible sense per pattern. In practice this assumption is often violated. In this paper we overcome this issue by inducing clusters of pattern senses from feature representations of patterns. In particular, we employ a topic model to partition entity pairs associated with patterns into sense clusters using local and global features. We merge these sense clusters into semantic relations using hierarchical agglomerative clustering. We compare against several baselines: a generative latent-variable model, a clustering method that does not disambiguate between path senses, and our own approach but with only local features. Experimental results show our proposed approach discovers dramatically more accurate clusters than models without sense disambiguation, and that incorporating global features, such as the document theme, is crucial.</p><p>5 0.44206411 <a title="14-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Bootstrapping_a_Unified_Model_of_Lexical_and_Phonetic_Acquisition.html">41 acl-2012-Bootstrapping a Unified Model of Lexical and Phonetic Acquisition</a></p>
<p>Author: Micha Elsner ; Sharon Goldwater ; Jacob Eisenstein</p><p>Abstract: ILCC, School of Informatics School of Interactive Computing University of Edinburgh Georgia Institute of Technology Edinburgh, EH8 9AB, UK Atlanta, GA, 30308, USA (a) intended: /ju want w2n/ /want e kUki/ (b) surface: [j@ w a?P w2n] [wan @ kUki] During early language acquisition, infants must learn both a lexicon and a model of phonetics that explains how lexical items can vary in pronunciation—for instance “the” might be realized as [Di] or [D@]. Previous models of acquisition have generally tackled these problems in isolation, yet behavioral evidence suggests infants acquire lexical and phonetic knowledge simultaneously. We present a Bayesian model that clusters together phonetic variants of the same lexical item while learning both a language model over lexical items and a log-linear model of pronunciation variability based on articulatory features. The model is trained on transcribed surface pronunciations, and learns by bootstrapping, without access to the true lexicon. We test the model using a corpus of child-directed speech with realistic phonetic variation and either gold standard or automatically induced word boundaries. In both cases modeling variability improves the accuracy of the learned lexicon over a system that assumes each lexical item has a unique pronunciation.</p><p>6 0.44057706 <a title="14-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Modeling_Review_Comments.html">144 acl-2012-Modeling Review Comments</a></p>

<p>Author: JinYeong Bak ; Suin Kim ; Alice Oh</p><p>Abstract: In social psychology, it is generally accepted that one discloses more of his/her personal information to someone in a strong relationship. We present a computational framework for automatically analyzing such self-disclosure behavior in Twitter conversations. Our framework uses text mining techniques to discover topics, emotions, sentiments, lexical patterns, as well as personally identifiable information (PII) and personally embarrassing information (PEI). Our preliminary results illustrate that in relationships with high relationship strength, Twitter users show significantly more frequent behaviors of self-disclosure.</p><p>3 0.09025111 <a title="70-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Multilingual_Subjectivity_and_Sentiment_Analysis.html">151 acl-2012-Multilingual Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Rada Mihalcea ; Carmen Banea ; Janyce Wiebe</p><p>Abstract: Subjectivity and sentiment analysis focuses on the automatic identification of private states, such as opinions, emotions, sentiments, evaluations, beliefs, and speculations in natural language. While subjectivity classification labels text as either subjective or objective, sentiment classification adds an additional level of granularity, by further classifying subjective text as either positive, negative or neutral. While much of the research work in this area has been applied to English, research on other languages is growing, including Japanese, Chinese, German, Spanish, Romanian. While most of the researchers in the field are familiar with the methods applied on English, few of them have closely looked at the original research carried out in other languages. For example, in languages such as Chinese, researchers have been looking at the ability of characters to carry sentiment information (Ku et al., 2005; Xiang, 2011). In Romanian, due to markers of politeness and additional verbal modes embedded in the language, experiments have hinted that subjectivity detection may be easier to achieve (Banea et al., 2008). These additional sources ofinformation may not be available across all languages, yet, various articles have pointed out that by investigating a synergistic approach for detecting subjectivity and sentiment in multiple languages at the same time, improvements can be achieved not only in other languages, but in English as well. The development and interest in these methods is also highly motivated by the fact that only 27% of Internet users speak English (www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm, 4 . unt . edu wiebe @ c s . pitt . edu Oct 11, 2011), and that number diminishes further every year, as more people across the globe gain Internet access. The aim of this tutorial is to familiarize the attendees with the subjectivity and sentiment research carried out on languages other than English in order to enable and promote crossfertilization. Specifically, we will review work along three main directions. First, we will present methods where the resources and tools have been specifically developed for a given target language. In this category, we will also briefly overview the main methods that have been proposed for English, but which can be easily ported to other languages. Second, we will describe cross-lingual approaches, including several methods that have been proposed to leverage on the resources and tools available in English by using cross-lingual projections. Finally, third, we will show how the expression of opinions and polarity pervades language boundaries, and thus methods that holistically explore multiple languages at the same time can be effectively considered.

<p>Author: Ai Ti Aw ; Lian Hau Lee</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes the personalized normalization of a multilingual chat system that supports chatting in user defined short-forms or abbreviations. One of the major challenges for multilingual chat realized through machine translation technology is the normalization of non-standard, self-created short-forms in the chat message to standard words before translation. Due to the lack of training data and the variations of short-forms used among different social communities, it is hard to normalize and translate chat messages if user uses vocabularies outside the training data and create short-forms freely. We develop a personalized chat normalizer for English and integrate it with a multilingual chat system, allowing user to create and use personalized short-forms in multilingual chat. 1</p><p>5 0.047330581 <a title="70-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Social_Event_Radar%3A_A_Bilingual_Context_Mining_and_Sentiment_Analysis_Summarization_System.html">180 acl-2012-Social Event Radar: A Bilingual Context Mining and Sentiment Analysis Summarization System</a></p>
<p>Author: Wen-Tai Hsieh ; Chen-Ming Wu ; Tsun Ku ; Seng-cho T. Chou</p><p>Abstract: Social Event Radar is a new social networking-based service platform, that aim to alert as well as monitor any merchandise flaws, food-safety related issues, unexpected eruption of diseases or campaign issues towards to the Government, enterprises of any kind or election parties, through keyword expansion detection module, using bilingual sentiment opinion analysis tool kit to conclude the specific event social dashboard and deliver the outcome helping authorities to plan “risk control” strategy. With the rapid development of social network, people can now easily publish their opinions on the Internet. On the other hand, people can also obtain various opinions from others in a few seconds even though they do not know each other. A typical approach to obtain required information is to use a search engine with some relevant keywords. We thus take the social media and forum as our major data source and aim at collecting specific issues efficiently and effectively in this work. 163 Chen-Ming Wu Institute for Information Industry cmwu@ i i i .org .tw Seng-cho T.

<p>Author: Fei Liu ; Fuliang Weng ; Xiao Jiang</p><p>Abstract: Social media language contains huge amount and wide variety of nonstandard tokens, created both intentionally and unintentionally by the users. It is of crucial importance to normalize the noisy nonstandard tokens before applying other NLP techniques. A major challenge facing this task is the system coverage, i.e., for any user-created nonstandard term, the system should be able to restore the correct word within its top n output candidates. In this paper, we propose a cognitivelydriven normalization system that integrates different human perspectives in normalizing the nonstandard tokens, including the enhanced letter transformation, visual priming, and string/phonetic similarity. The system was evaluated on both word- and messagelevel using four SMS and Twitter data sets. Results show that our system achieves over 90% word-coverage across all data sets (a . 10% absolute increase compared to state-ofthe-art); the broad word-coverage can also successfully translate into message-level performance gain, yielding 6% absolute increase compared to the best prior approach.</p><p>6 0.19137204 <a title="70-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-Beefmoves%3A_Dissemination%2C_Diversity%2C_and_Dynamics_of_English_Borrowings_in_a_German_Hip_Hop_Forum.html">39 acl-2012-Beefmoves: Dissemination, Diversity, and Dynamics of English Borrowings in a German Hip Hop Forum</a></p>

<p>Author: Lun-Wei Ku ; Cheng-Wei Sun ; Ya-Hsin Hsueh</p><p>Abstract: We present IlluMe, a software tool pack which creates a personalized ambient using the music and lighting. IlluMe includes an emotion analysis software, the small space ambient lighting, and a multimedia controller. The software analyzes emotional changes from instant message logs and corresponds the detected emotion to the best sound and light settings. The ambient lighting can sparkle with different forms of light and the smart phone can broadcast music respectively according to different atmosphere. All settings can be modified by the multimedia controller at any time and the new settings will be feedback to the emotion analysis software. The IlluMe system, equipped with the learning function, provides a link between residential situation and personal emotion. It works in a Chinese chatting environment to illustrate the language technology in life.</p><p>2 0.32686171 <a title="70-lda-2" href="./acl-2012-The_Creation_of_a_Corpus_of_English_Metalanguage.html">195 acl-2012-The Creation of a Corpus of English Metalanguage</a></p>
<p>Author: Shomir Wilson</p><p>Abstract: Metalanguage is an essential linguistic mechanism which allows us to communicate explicit information about language itself. However, it has been underexamined in research in language technologies, to the detriment of the performance of systems that could exploit it. This paper describes the creation of the first tagged and delineated corpus of English metalanguage, accompanied by an explicit definition and a rubric for identifying the phenomenon in text. This resource will provide a basis for further studies of metalanguage and enable its utilization in language technologies.</p><p>3 0.32517582 <a title="70-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-A_System_for_Real-time_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_of_2012_U.S._Presidential_Election_Cycle.html">21 acl-2012-A System for Real-time Twitter Sentiment Analysis of 2012 U.S. Presidential Election Cycle</a></p>
<p>Author: Hao Wang ; Dogan Can ; Abe Kazemzadeh ; Francois Bar ; Shrikanth Narayanan</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a system for real-time analysis of public sentiment toward presidential candidates in the 2012 U.S. election as expressed on Twitter, a microblogging service. Twitter has become a central site where people express their opinions and views on political parties and candidates. Emerging events or news are often followed almost instantly by a burst in Twitter volume, providing a unique opportunity to gauge the relation between expressed public sentiment and electoral events. In addition, sentiment analysis can help explore how these events affect public opinion. While traditional content analysis takes days or weeks to complete, the system demonstrated here analyzes sentiment in the entire Twitter traffic about the election, delivering results instantly and continuously. It offers the public, the media, politicians and scholars a new and timely perspective on the dynamics of the electoral process and public opinion. 1</p><p>4 0.32390261 <a title="70-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Crosslingual_Induction_of_Semantic_Roles.html">64 acl-2012-Crosslingual Induction of Semantic Roles</a></p>
<p>Author: Ivan Titov ; Alexandre Klementiev</p><p>Abstract: We argue that multilingual parallel data provides a valuable source of indirect supervision for induction of shallow semantic representations. Specifically, we consider unsupervised induction of semantic roles from sentences annotated with automatically-predicted syntactic dependency representations and use a stateof-the-art generative Bayesian non-parametric model. At inference time, instead of only seeking the model which explains the monolingual data available for each language, we regularize the objective by introducing a soft constraint penalizing for disagreement in argument labeling on aligned sentences. We propose a simple approximate learning algorithm for our set-up which results in efficient inference. When applied to German-English parallel data, our method obtains a substantial improvement over a model trained without using the agreement signal, when both are tested on non-parallel sentences.</p><p>5 0.32285056 <a title="70-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Combining_Textual_Entailment_and_Argumentation_Theory_for_Supporting_Online_Debates_Interactions.html">53 acl-2012-Combining Textual Entailment and Argumentation Theory for Supporting Online Debates Interactions</a></p>
<p>Author: Elena Cabrio ; Serena Villata</p><p>Abstract: Blogs and forums are widely adopted by online communities to debate about various issues. However, a user that wants to cut in on a debate may experience some difficulties in extracting the current accepted positions, and can be discouraged from interacting through these applications. In our paper, we combine textual entailment with argumentation theory to automatically extract the arguments from debates and to evaluate their acceptability.</p><p>6 0.32128435 <a title="70-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Social_Event_Radar%3A_A_Bilingual_Context_Mining_and_Sentiment_Analysis_Summarization_System.html">180 acl-2012-Social Event Radar: A Bilingual Context Mining and Sentiment Analysis Summarization System</a></p>

[sent-5, score-0.662]
</p><p>2 IlluMe includes an emotion analysis software, the small space ambient lighting, and a multimedia controller. [sent-6, score-0.994]
</p><p>3 The software analyzes emotional changes from instant message logs and corresponds the detected emotion to the best sound and light settings. [sent-7, score-0.867]
</p><p>4 The ambient lighting can sparkle with different forms of light and the smart phone can broadcast music respectively according to different atmosphere. [sent-8, score-1.196]
</p><p>5 All settings can be modified by the multimedia controller at any time and the new settings will be feedback to the emotion analysis software. [sent-9, score-0.716]
</p><p>6 The IlluMe system, equipped with the  learning function, provides a link between residential situation and personal emotion. [sent-10, score-0.109]
</p><p>7 However, most of them were Internet applications, and to the best knowledge of the authors, these technologies have not yet been involved in the ambient creation. [sent-16, score-0.43]
</p><p>8 To create an intelligent living space, some researchers utilized the facial expression and speech recognizer 97  . [sent-17, score-0.096]
</p><p>9 Some researchers tried to use sensors to watch the heart beat and the body temperature of residents to know their current emotion for further  applications, but the problem was that users had to wear sensors and it was inconvenient. [sent-23, score-0.729]
</p><p>10 Therefore, we tried to find clues from the textual conversations of the residents in order to detect their psychological state. [sent-25, score-0.136]
</p><p>11 Different emotion states were used for experiments in previous research (Bellegarda, 2010). [sent-27, score-0.545]
</p><p>12 To find suitable categories of emotions, we adopted the three-layered emotion hierarchy proposed by Parrott (2001)1. [sent-28, score-0.597]
</p><p>13 Six emotions are in the first layer, including love, joy, surprise, anger, sadness and fear. [sent-29, score-0.128]
</p><p>14 We can categorize emotions from rough to fine granularities and degrade to the upper level when the experimental materials are insufficient. [sent-32, score-0.215]
</p><p>15 As to the music, most researchers looked for the emotions in songs or rhythms (Yang and Chen, 2011; Zbikowski, 2011). [sent-34, score-0.211]
</p><p>16 They classified music  into different emotional categories and developed the system to tell what emotion a song might bring to a listener. [sent-35, score-0.9]
</p><p>17 sc so2c0i1a2tio Ans fo cri Catio mnp fuotra Ctio mnaplu Ltaintigouniaslti Lcsin,g puagisetsic 9s7–102, comfortable ambient, what songs a person in a certain emotional state wants to listen to becomes the question. [sent-40, score-0.182]
</p><p>18 A happy user does not always enjoy happy songs, and vice versa. [sent-41, score-0.118]
</p><p>19 IlluMe was designed for a small space personal environment. [sent-43, score-0.109]
</p><p>20 We expect that users would like to use it because this system could interactively respond to their personal status to provide a feeling of the companion. [sent-44, score-0.2]
</p><p>21 We view the IlluMe system as a realization of detecting emotions from users’ textual conversations and then recommending the best ambient accordingly. [sent-45, score-0.625]
</p><p>22 First, a corpus for ambient creation according to emotions was constructed. [sent-47, score-0.558]
</p><p>23 Second, IlluMe  demonstrates a way to apply the state of the art technology of emotion analysis and recommendation to create an intelligent living space. [sent-48, score-0.666]
</p><p>24 The system was designed to fit in with the modern people’s life style: programs are installed in users’ personal computer and smart phone. [sent-51, score-0.288]
</p><p>25 The smart phone functions as the remote control and the music player, while all setting signals are sent out from the personal computer. [sent-52, score-0.61]
</p><p>26 The smart phone and the personal computer communicate through the wireless network. [sent-53, score-0.34]
</p><p>27 The only additional hardware requirement is the lighting set. [sent-54, score-0.319]
</p><p>28 1 System Features Emotion Detection Switch: The system detects users’ current emotion according to messenger logs once a preset time period. [sent-56, score-0.778]
</p><p>29 It is ON/OFF switchable if users do not want the conversations to be recorded or utilized when determining the ambient. [sent-57, score-0.129]
</p><p>30 Auto Ambient Setting: The system sets the current ambient by a specific combination of a song and a light group which corresponds to the emotion or represents a special atmosphere. [sent-58, score-1.034]
</p><p>31 Manual Ambient Adjustment: IlluMe provides a friendly user interface to change the settings of music and lighting at any time. [sent-59, score-0.688]
</p><p>32 98 Personal Preference Learning: When users change the settings, the new ones are recorded. [sent-60, score-0.099]
</p><p>33 IlluMe learns the preference and then performs the user adaptation. [sent-61, score-0.089]
</p><p>34 After a period of time users will have their unique ambient creating system. [sent-62, score-0.497]
</p><p>35 Unlimited Melodies and Rich Light Colors: Users can add their songs in the smart phone for selection at any time. [sent-63, score-0.29]
</p><p>36 The learning process will help propose the new songs to create ambient later. [sent-64, score-0.535]
</p><p>37 Instant State Update: IlluMe watches the user input from messenger when the software is on. [sent-65, score-0.24]
</p><p>38 Therefore, it is able to change the music and lighting according to the detected emotion within a preset time period and users will feel like the environment is interacting with them. [sent-66, score-1.24]
</p><p>39 The system automatically watches the User Messages from messenger logs. [sent-69, score-0.177]
</p><p>40 The Emotion Analysis component detects the emotion of users, while the Ambient Learning Model determines the music and lighting accordingly, considering also the Personal Information of users. [sent-70, score-1.069]
</p><p>41 After the lights are on and the music is played, the user can change the settings they are not satisfying. [sent-71, score-0.369]
</p><p>42 A smart phone (Mobile Device) is used to change the settings, with two controllers on it: the Preference Controller and the Ambient Controller. [sent-72, score-0.239]
</p><p>43 The former takes the User Input for new settings, and then the music and lighting are changed by the latter. [sent-73, score-0.524]
</p><p>44 At the same time, the Preference Controller also sends the new settings to Ambient Learning Model to be recorded for user adaptation when creating the next ambient. [sent-74, score-0.108]
</p><p>45 The Emotion Analysis Component and Ambient Learning Model are two programs in a personal computer, and the Personal Info is saved in the personal computer, too. [sent-75, score-0.218]
</p><p>46 ANT wireless personal network protocol (Dynastream) is adopted to send the control signals to the Lighting. [sent-76, score-0.214]
</p><p>47 The LED lighting board is utilized to implement the Lighting of 65,536 colors. [sent-77, score-0.423]
</p><p>48 3  Operation Flowchart of User Interface  The IlluMe system provides a user interface to change the settings by a smart phone (Mobile Device), functioning as a remote control. [sent-79, score-0.428]
</p><p>49 Users can select the location of music or the lighting, e. [sent-80, score-0.205]
</p><p>50 In the manual mode, users can set the color of a specific light; in the automatic mode, users select an emotional color set or a desired atmosphere for the lighting. [sent-85, score-0.377]
</p><p>51 4 Ambient Lighting and Music Playing To design the ambient lighting, one has to take LED array board, controlling mode and the lightmixing effect of the lampshade into consideration. [sent-88, score-0.483]
</p><p>52 The controlling module distinguishes each lamp by its own code to modify the brightness of different colored LEDs within. [sent-90, score-0.091]
</p><p>53 Music is broadcasted according to the detected  emotional state. [sent-93, score-0.171]
</p><p>54 The broadcasting function and the controlling function are both realized by the software in the smart phone. [sent-94, score-0.188]
</p><p>55 3  Emotion Analysis  The emotion analysis that IlluMe performed is to find the emotions that texts in messenger logs bear in order to create a comfort ambient by sound and lighting accordingly. [sent-97, score-1.661]
</p><p>56 To achieve this, the system needs to understand the Internet language first, and then detect emotions and categorize them. [sent-98, score-0.205]
</p><p>57 The system works on the Chinese chatting environment and analyzes Chinese texts to detect emotions. [sent-99, score-0.12]
</p><p>58 1 Experimental Materials Two dictionaries, the Chinese sentiment dictionary NTUSD (Ku and Chen, 2007) and the Chinese  emotion dictionary (Lin et al. [sent-102, score-0.603]
</p><p>59 The former categorized sentiment words into positive and negative, while the latter into eight emotion types: awesome, heartwarming, surprising, sad, useful, happy, boring, and angry. [sent-104, score-0.589]
</p><p>60 Notice that these eight emotion 99  types appeared in Yahoo! [sent-105, score-0.545]
</p><p>61 News Taiwan in the year 2008 and not all of them were general emotion states. [sent-106, score-0.545]
</p><p>62 Therefore, we tried to find Lin’s emotion categories in Parrott’s emotion hierarchy before using this dictionary. [sent-107, score-1.117]
</p><p>63 Messenger logs were used as the source to detect emotions. [sent-109, score-0.08]
</p><p>64 Whenever there was at least one new message, once an hour the collecting program would pop up the menu and ask them to annotate the current emotion together with the preferred settings of the music and lighting. [sent-113, score-0.798]
</p><p>65 There were 3,290 songs, 15 emotional lighting colors and 6 atmospheres for selection. [sent-114, score-0.467]
</p><p>66 2 Interpretation of Zhuyin Wen When processing Internet Chinese texts, IlluMe transformed messenger logs and sentiment dictionaries into zhuyin (Su, 2003) before looking for emotions2. [sent-118, score-0.353]
</p><p>67 Zhuyin Wen (注音文) is one of many creative uses of writing systems in the Internet language. [sent-120, score-0.073]
</p><p>68 Generally we had to figure out the missing vowels to understand the word, but in our system a reversed approach (dropping vowels) was adopted to make sure the system did not miss any possible match of dictionary terms observed in the conversations. [sent-128, score-0.117]
</p><p>69 When messenger users typed characters by their phonetics (consonants and vowels), very often they selected the wrong one from candidates of the same pronunciation, or they were just too lazy to select so the writing system chose the default candidate for them. [sent-129, score-0.243]
</p><p>70 Transforming characters in both dictionaries and conversations into their zhuyin representations before detecting emotions also help recover this kind of errors. [sent-131, score-0.323]
</p><p>71 2 shows how the system dealt with the error prone Internet texts and found the dictionaries terms. [sent-134, score-0.087]
</p><p>72 The scores of terms of different emotional categories were summed up and the emotion category of the highest score was selected as the detected emotion. [sent-136, score-0.715]
</p><p>73 The Ambient Learning Model takes the detected emotion and selects the corresponding music and lighting by the Naïve Bayes classifier trained by the annotated materials. [sent-137, score-1.113]
</p><p>74 4 Experiment and Preliminary Results Table 2 shows that using enhanced NTUSD (an augmented version of NTUSD) together with zhuyin transformation achieves the best results for emotion classification (positive/negative). [sent-139, score-0.67]
</p><p>75 Because IlluMe would always recommend a new or unchanged ambient setting, it would always find the closest emotion category of the user’s current emotion. [sent-144, score-0.975]
</p><p>76 In other words, the chatting content would always be connected to one of six emotion categories, so precision is the best metric to evaluate the performance of the system. [sent-145, score-0.581]
</p><p>77 The micro-average precision of the emotion detection was 0. [sent-146, score-0.545]
</p><p>78 Notice that the categories in Lin’ s Chinese emotional dictionary were not identical to ours and hence we could not find terms for some categories in it. [sent-151, score-0.172]
</p><p>79 Therefore, though Bellegarda’s and our results were done on different datasets and evaluated by different metrics, considering our system suffered for the lack of terms in some categories and the ambiguous texts from the creative writing, the performance was considered acceptable. [sent-152, score-0.133]
</p><p>80 For the ambient recommendation, the microaverage precision of selecting the settings of  lighting according to the detected emotion was 0. [sent-153, score-1.386]
</p><p>81 5 Ambient Learning Function Because bringing up the settings to users is like a behavior of recommendation, we adopted the concept of collaborative filtering to design the function of the Ambient Learning Model. [sent-161, score-0.195]
</p><p>82 In the early stage of using IlluMe, it proposes the most frequently selected settings, that is, the choice of a group of people in the specific emotional state. [sent-162, score-0.099]
</p><p>83 If the user is connected to the Internet, the user experience will be transferred back to the servers to help recommend a better ambient to other users. [sent-163, score-0.55]
</p><p>84 The user experience optimization was feasible in this system because of the use of the smart phone, and this function was also implemented. [sent-164, score-0.217]
</p><p>85 As the users update the settings, the system knows their preference. [sent-165, score-0.091]
</p><p>86 In the later stage of using IlluMe, the  Ambient Learning Model considers the preference 101 of both the individual and the group to create a unique ambient for each user. [sent-166, score-0.481]
</p><p>87 Therefore we implemented emotion analysis technique to equip a space with the ability to observe the status of its residents and interact with them accordingly. [sent-169, score-0.614]
</p><p>88 The instant interior lightings and music change can be viewed as a new form of “conversation”. [sent-170, score-0.306]
</p><p>89 Residents can not only take the ambient provided by IlluMe, but can also give feedbacks. [sent-171, score-0.43]
</p><p>90 The concept of collaborative filtering was also implemented as we viewed the proposing of ambient as a kind of recommendation. [sent-172, score-0.485]
</p><p>91 We will continue collecting annotated materials and user feedbacks for learning, and make the materials a corpus for the research community. [sent-174, score-0.176]
</p><p>92 Facebook will be a source of text collection to gather more complete personal conversations for emotion detection. [sent-175, score-0.697]
</p><p>93 Making the IlluMe components real products like the home lighting system, the intelligent table lamp, or the music album promoter is also a future plan. [sent-176, score-0.524]
</p><p>94 5  Demonstration  As demonstrating the IlluMe system by our original model house may be difficult in transportation and it may need a large space for demonstration, we will demonstrate the lightings by several table lamps, in which the LED lighting board resides. [sent-177, score-0.456]
</p><p>95 Other software will be performed on the smart phone and the personal computer. [sent-178, score-0.343]
</p><p>96 Potential users might be interested in how the system will work if they have it in their personal computers and smart phones. [sent-181, score-0.333]
</p><p>97 Therefore, we demonstrate the whole IlluMe system with the actual music and lighting. [sent-182, score-0.229]
</p><p>98 Users can type Chinese words in messengers from the personal computer, and then the IlluMe system will change the music and lighting according to the proposed settings in a short time. [sent-183, score-0.737]
</p><p>99 The user can also control the music and lighting from the interface by the smart phone. [sent-184, score-0.761]
</p><p>100 For example, zhuyin, terms found in the dictionaries, emotion scores, the detected emotion and the suggested settings. [sent-186, score-1.134]

Our preliminary results illustrate that in relationships with high relationship strength, Twitter users show significantly more frequent behaviors of self-disclosure.</p><p>3 0.047721826 <a title="70-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Social_Event_Radar%3A_A_Bilingual_Context_Mining_and_Sentiment_Analysis_Summarization_System.html">180 acl-2012-Social Event Radar: A Bilingual Context Mining and Sentiment Analysis Summarization System</a></p>
<p>Author: Wen-Tai Hsieh ; Chen-Ming Wu ; Tsun Ku ; Seng-cho T. Chou</p><p>Abstract: Social Event Radar is a new social networking-based service platform, that aim to alert as well as monitor any merchandise flaws, food-safety related issues, unexpected eruption of diseases or campaign issues towards to the Government, enterprises of any kind or election parties, through keyword expansion detection module, using bilingual sentiment opinion analysis tool kit to conclude the specific event social dashboard and deliver the outcome helping authorities to plan “risk control” strategy. With the rapid development of social network, people can now easily publish their opinions on the Internet. On the other hand, people can also obtain various opinions from others in a few seconds even though they do not know each other. A typical approach to obtain required information is to use a search engine with some relevant keywords. We thus take the social media and forum as our major data source and aim at collecting specific issues efficiently and effectively in this work. 163 Chen-Ming Wu Institute for Information Industry cmwu@ i i i .org .tw Seng-cho T.

<p>Author: Rui Yan ; Mirella Lapata ; Xiaoming Li</p><p>Abstract: Mirella Lapata‡ Xiaoming Li†, \ ‡Institute for Language, \State Key Laboratory of Software Cognition and Computation, Development Environment, University of Edinburgh, Beihang University, Edinburgh EH8 9AB, UK Beijing 100083, China mlap@ inf .ed .ac .uk lxm@pku .edu .cn 2012.1 Twitter enables users to send and read textbased posts ofup to 140 characters, known as tweets. As one of the most popular micro-blogging services, Twitter attracts millions of users, producing millions of tweets daily. Shared information through this service spreads faster than would have been possible with traditional sources, however the proliferation of user-generation content poses challenges to browsing and finding valuable information. In this paper we propose a graph-theoretic model for tweet recommendation that presents users with items they may have an interest in. Our model ranks tweets and their authors simultaneously using several networks: the social network connecting the users, the network connecting the tweets, and a third network that ties the two together. Tweet and author entities are ranked following a co-ranking algorithm based on the intuition that that there is a mutually reinforcing relationship between tweets and their authors that could be reflected in the rankings. We show that this framework can be parametrized to take into account user preferences, the popularity of tweets and their authors, and diversity. Experimental evaluation on a large dataset shows that our model out- performs competitive approaches by a large margin.</p><p>5 0.041738309 <a title="70-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Personalized_Normalization_for_a_Multilingual_Chat_System.html">160 acl-2012-Personalized Normalization for a Multilingual Chat System</a></p>
<p>Author: Ai Ti Aw ; Lian Hau Lee</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes the personalized normalization of a multilingual chat system that supports chatting in user defined short-forms or abbreviations. One of the major challenges for multilingual chat realized through machine translation technology is the normalization of non-standard, self-created short-forms in the chat message to standard words before translation. Due to the lack of training data and the variations of short-forms used among different social communities, it is hard to normalize and translate chat messages if user uses vocabularies outside the training data and create short-forms freely. We develop a personalized chat normalizer for English and integrate it with a multilingual chat system, allowing user to create and use personalized short-forms in multilingual chat. 1</p><p>6 0.041622099 <a title="70-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-A_Web-based_Evaluation_Framework_for_Spatial_Instruction-Giving_Systems.html">24 acl-2012-A Web-based Evaluation Framework for Spatial Instruction-Giving Systems</a></p>

<p>Author: JinYeong Bak ; Suin Kim ; Alice Oh</p><p>Abstract: In social psychology, it is generally accepted that one discloses more of his/her personal information to someone in a strong relationship. We present a computational framework for automatically analyzing such self-disclosure behavior in Twitter conversations. Our framework uses text mining techniques to discover topics, emotions, sentiments, lexical patterns, as well as personally identifiable information (PII) and personally embarrassing information (PEI). Our preliminary results illustrate that in relationships with high relationship strength, Twitter users show significantly more frequent behaviors of self-disclosure.</p><p>3 0.5968464 <a title="70-lsi-3" href="./acl-2012-A_Comprehensive_Gold_Standard_for_the_Enron_Organizational_Hierarchy.html">6 acl-2012-A Comprehensive Gold Standard for the Enron Organizational Hierarchy</a></p>

With the rapid development of social network, people can now easily publish their opinions on the Internet. On the other hand, people can also obtain various opinions from others in a few seconds even though they do not know each other. A typical approach to obtain required information is to use a search engine with some relevant keywords. We thus take the social media and forum as our major data source and aim at collecting specific issues efficiently and effectively in this work. 163 Chen-Ming Wu Institute for Information Industry cmwu@ i i i .org .tw Seng-cho T.

<p>Author: Yukino Baba ; Hisami Suzuki</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of spelling errors that are corrected as you type, vs. those that remain uncorrected. First, we generate naturally occurring online error correction data by logging users’ keystrokes, and by automatically deriving pre- and postcorrection strings from them. We then perform an analysis of this data against the errors that remain in the final text as well as across languages. Our analysis shows a clear distinction between the types of errors that are generated and those that remain uncorrected, as well as across languages.</p><p>3 0.49504393 <a title="70-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Sentence_Simplification_by_Monolingual_Machine_Translation.html">178 acl-2012-Sentence Simplification by Monolingual Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Sander Wubben ; Antal van den Bosch ; Emiel Krahmer</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we describe a method for simplifying sentences using Phrase Based Machine Translation, augmented with a re-ranking heuristic based on dissimilarity, and trained on a monolingual parallel corpus. We compare our system to a word-substitution baseline and two state-of-the-art systems, all trained and tested on paired sentences from the English part of Wikipedia and Simple Wikipedia. Human test subjects judge the output of the different systems. Analysing the judgements shows that by relatively careful phrase-based paraphrasing our model achieves similar sim- a. plification results to state-of-the-art systems, while generating better formed output. We also argue that text readability metrics such as the Flesch-Kincaid grade level should be used with caution when evaluating the output of simplification systems.</p><p>4 0.3639673 <a title="70-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Self-Disclosure_and_Relationship_Strength_in_Twitter_Conversations.html">173 acl-2012-Self-Disclosure and Relationship Strength in Twitter Conversations</a></p>

<p>Author: Hao Wang ; Dogan Can ; Abe Kazemzadeh ; Francois Bar ; Shrikanth Narayanan</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a system for real-time analysis of public sentiment toward presidential candidates in the 2012 U.S. election as expressed on Twitter, a microblogging service. Twitter has become a central site where people express their opinions and views on political parties and candidates. Emerging events or news are often followed almost instantly by a burst in Twitter volume, providing a unique opportunity to gauge the relation between expressed public sentiment and electoral events. In addition, sentiment analysis can help explore how these events affect public opinion. While traditional content analysis takes days or weeks to complete, the system demonstrated here analyzes sentiment in the entire Twitter traffic about the election, delivering results instantly and continuously. It offers the public, the media, politicians and scholars a new and timely perspective on the dynamics of the electoral process and public opinion. 1</p><p>6 0.35150972 <a title="70-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-UWN%3A_A_Large_Multilingual_Lexical_Knowledge_Base.html">206 acl-2012-UWN: A Large Multilingual Lexical Knowledge Base</a></p>

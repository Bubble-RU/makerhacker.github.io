<p>Author: Weiwei Sun ; Hans Uszkoreit</p><p>Abstract: From the perspective of structural linguistics, we explore paradigmatic and syntagmatic lexical relations for Chinese POS tagging, an important and challenging task for Chinese language processing. Paradigmatic lexical relations are explicitly captured by word clustering on large-scale unlabeled data and are used to design new features to enhance a discriminative tagger. Syntagmatic lexical relations are implicitly captured by constituent parsing and are utilized via system combination. Experiments on the Penn Chinese Treebank demonstrate the importance of both paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations. Our linguistically motivated approaches yield a relative error reduction of 18% in total over a stateof-the-art baseline.</p><p>3 0.10274082 <a title="189-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Word_Epoch_Disambiguation%3A_Finding_How_Words_Change_Over_Time.html">216 acl-2012-Word Epoch Disambiguation: Finding How Words Change Over Time</a></p>
<p>Author: Rada Mihalcea ; Vivi Nastase</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce the novel task of “word epoch disambiguation,” defined as the problem of identifying changes in word usage over time.

<p>Author: Spence Green ; John DeNero</p><p>Abstract: When automatically translating from a weakly inflected source language like English to a target language with richer grammatical features such as gender and dual number, the output commonly contains morpho-syntactic agreement errors. To address this issue, we present a target-side, class-based agreement model. Agreement is promoted by scoring a sequence of fine-grained morpho-syntactic classes that are predicted during decoding for each translation hypothesis. For English-to-Arabic translation, our model yields a +1.04 BLEU average improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline. The model does not require bitext or phrase table annotations and can be easily implemented as a feature in many phrase-based decoders. 1</p><p>5 0.096561871 <a title="189-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Exploiting_Multiple_Treebanks_for_Parsing_with_Quasi-synchronous_Grammars.html">87 acl-2012-Exploiting Multiple Treebanks for Parsing with Quasi-synchronous Grammars</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhenghua Li ; Ting Liu ; Wanxiang Che</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple and effective framework for exploiting multiple monolingual treebanks with different annotation guidelines for parsing. Several types of transformation patterns (TP) are designed to capture the systematic annotation inconsistencies among different treebanks. Based on such TPs, we design quasisynchronous grammar features to augment the baseline parsing models. Our approach can significantly advance the state-of-the-art parsing accuracy on two widely used target treebanks (Penn Chinese Treebank 5. 1 and 6.0) using the Chinese Dependency Treebank as the source treebank. The improvements are respectively 1.37% and 1.10% with automatic part-of-speech tags. Moreover, an indirect comparison indicates that our approach also outperforms previous work based on treebank conversion.</p><p>6 0.085496448 <a title="189-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Exploring_Deterministic_Constraints%3A_from_a_Constrained_English_POS_Tagger_to_an_Efficient_ILP_Solution_to_Chinese_Word_Segmentation.html">89 acl-2012-Exploring Deterministic Constraints: from a Constrained English POS Tagger to an Efficient ILP Solution to Chinese Word Segmentation</a></p>

This paper evaluates two empirical strategies to integrate multiword units in a real constituency parsing context and shows that the results are not as promising as has sometimes been suggested. Firstly, we show that pregrouping multiword expressions before parsing with a state-of-the-art recognizer improves multiword recognition accuracy and unlabeled attachment score. However, it has no statistically significant impact in terms of F-score as incorrect multiword expression recognition has important side effects on parsing. Secondly, integrating multiword expressions in the parser grammar followed by a reranker specific to such expressions slightly improves all evaluation metrics.</p><p>5 0.63114184 <a title="189-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-Learning_Syntactic_Verb_Frames_using_Graphical_Models.html">130 acl-2012-Learning Syntactic Verb Frames using Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Lippincott ; Anna Korhonen ; Diarmuid O Seaghdha</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach for verb subcategorization lexicons using a simple graphical model. In contrast to previous methods, we show how the model can be trained without parsed input or a predefined subcategorization frame inventory. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on a verb clustering task, and is easily trained on arbitrary domains. This quantitative evaluation is com- plemented by a qualitative discussion of verbs and their frames. We discuss the advantages of graphical models for this task, in particular the ease of integrating semantic information about verbs and arguments in a principled fashion. We conclude with future work to augment the approach.</p><p>6 0.61664653 <a title="189-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-Lemmatisation_as_a_Tagging_Task.html">137 acl-2012-Lemmatisation as a Tagging Task</a></p>

<p>Author: Stephen Tyndall</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents the problem within Hittite and Ancient Near Eastern studies of fragmented and damaged cuneiform texts, and proposes to use well-known text classification metrics, in combination with some facts about the structure of Hittite-language cuneiform texts, to help classify a number offragments of clay cuneiform-script tablets into more complete texts. In particular, Ipropose using Sumerian and Akkadian ideogrammatic signs within Hittite texts to improve the performance of Naive Bayes and Maximum Entropy classifiers. The performance in some cases is improved, and in some cases very much not, suggesting that the variable frequency of occurrence of these ideograms in individual fragments makes considerable difference in the ideal choice for a classification method. Further, complexities of the writing system and the digital availability ofHittite texts complicate the problem.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.72685522 <a title="189-lda-2" href="./acl-2012-Syntactic_Annotations_for_the_Google_Books_NGram_Corpus.html">189 acl-2012-Syntactic Annotations for the Google Books NGram Corpus</a></p>

<p>Author: Luciana Benotti ; Martin Villalba ; Tessa Lau ; Julian Cerruti</p><p>Abstract: Previous approaches to instruction interpretation have required either extensive domain adaptation or manually annotated corpora. This paper presents a novel approach to instruction interpretation that leverages a large amount of unannotated, easy-to-collect data from humans interacting with a virtual world. We compare several algorithms for automatically segmenting and discretizing this data into (utterance, reaction) pairs and training a classifier to predict reactions given the next utterance. Our empirical analysis shows that the best algorithm achieves 70% accuracy on this task, with no manual annotation required. 1 Introduction and motivation Mapping instructions into automatically executable actions would enable the creation of natural lan- , guage interfaces to many applications (Lau et al., 2009; Branavan et al., 2009; Orkin and Roy, 2009). In this paper, we focus on the task of navigation and manipulation of a virtual environment (Vogel and Jurafsky, 2010; Chen and Mooney, 2011). Current symbolic approaches to the problem are brittle to the natural language variation present in instructions and require intensive rule authoring to be fit for a new task (Dzikovska et al., 2008). Current statistical approaches require extensive manual annotations of the corpora used for training (MacMahon et al., 2006; Matuszek et al., 2010; Gorniak and Roy, 2007; Rieser and Lemon, 2010). Manual annotation and rule authoring by natural language engineering experts are bottlenecks for developing conversational systems for new domains. 181 t e s s al au @ us . ibm . com, j ce rrut i ar .ibm . com @ This paper proposes a fully automated approach to interpreting natural language instructions to complete a task in a virtual world based on unsupervised recordings of human-human interactions perform- ing that task in that virtual world. Given unannotated corpora collected from humans following other humans’ instructions, our system automatically segments the corpus into labeled training data for a classification algorithm. Our interpretation algorithm is based on the observation that similar instructions uttered in similar contexts should lead to similar actions being taken in the virtual world. Given a previously unseen instruction, our system outputs actions that can be directly executed in the virtual world, based on what humans did when given similar instructions in the past. 2 Corpora situated in virtual worlds Our environment consists of six virtual worlds designed for the natural language generation shared task known as the GIVE Challenge (Koller et al., 2010), where a pair of partners must collaborate to solve a task in a 3D space (Figure 1). The “instruction follower” (IF) can move around in the virtual world, but has no knowledge of the task. The “instruction giver” (IG) types instructions to the IF in order to guide him to accomplish the task. Each corpus contains the IF’s actions and position recorded every 200 milliseconds, as well as the IG’s instruc- tions with their timestamps. We used two corpora for our experiments. The Cm corpus (Gargett et al., 2010) contains instructions given by multiple people, consisting of 37 games spanning 2163 instructions over 8: 17 hs.

The world consists of interconnecting hallways, rooms and objects Cs corpus (Benotti and Denis, 2011), gathered using a single IG, is composed of 63 games and 3417 in- structions, and was recorded in a span of 6:09 hs. It took less than 15 hours to collect the corpora through the web and the subjects reported that the experiment was fun. While the environment is restricted, people describe the same route and the same objects in extremely different ways. Below are some examples of instructions from our corpus all given for the same route shown in Figure 1. 1) out 2) walk down the passage 3) nowgo [sic] to the pink room 4) back to the room with the plant 5) Go through the door on the left 6) go through opening with yellow wall paper People describe routes using landmarks (4) or specific actions (2). They may describe the same object differently (5 vs 6). Instructions also differ in their scope (3 vs 1). Thus, even ignoring spelling and grammatical errors, navigation instructions contain considerable variation which makes interpreting them a challenging problem. 3 Learning from previous interpretations Our algorithm consists of two phases: annotation and interpretation. Annotation is performed only once and consists of automatically associating each IG instruction to an IF reaction. Interpretation is performed every time the system receives an instruc182 tion and consists of predicting an appropriate reaction given reactions observed in the corpus. Our method is based on the assumption that a reaction captures the semantics of the instruction that caused it. Therefore, if two utterances result in the same reaction, they are paraphrases of each other, and similar utterances should generate the same reaction. This approach enables us to predict reactions for previously-unseen instructions. 3.1 Annotation phase The key challenge in learning from massive amounts of easily-collected data is to automatically annotate an unannotated corpus. Our annotation method consists of two parts: first, segmenting a low-level interaction trace into utterances and corresponding reactions, and second, discretizing those reactions into canonical action sequences. Segmentation enables our algorithm to learn from traces of IFs interacting directly with a virtual world. Since the IF can move freely in the virtual world, his actions are a stream of continuous behavior. Segmentation divides these traces into reactions that follow from each utterance of the IG. Consider the following example starting at the situation shown in Figure 1: IG(1): go through the yellow opening IF(2): [walks out of the room] IF(3): [turns left at the intersection] IF(4): [enters the room with the sofa] IG(5): stop It is not clear whether the IF is doing h3, 4i because h neo tis c reacting htoe r1 t or Fbec isadu soei hge h 3is, being proactive. While one could manually annotate this data to remove extraneous actions, our goal is to develop automated solutions that enable learning from massive amounts of data. We decided to approach this problem by experimenting with two alternative formal definitions: 1) a strict definition that considers the maximum reaction according to the IF behavior, and 2) a loose defini- tion based on the empirical observation that, in situated interaction, most instructions are constrained by the current visually perceived affordances (Gibson, 1979; Stoia et al., 2006). We formally define behavior segmentation (Bhv) as follows. A reaction rk to an instruction uk begins right after the instruction uk is uttered and ends right before the next instruction uk+1 is uttered. In the example, instruction 1corresponds to h2, 3, 4i . We formally d inefsitnrue visibility segmentation (Vis) as f Wolelows. A reaction rk to an instruction uk begins right after the instruction uk is uttered and ends right before the next instruction uk+1 is uttered or right after the IF leaves the area visible at 360◦ from where uk was uttered. In the example, instruction 1’s reaction would be limited to h2i because the intersection is nwootu vldisi bbele l ifmroimte dw htoer he2 tihe b eicnasutrsuec ttihoen was suetctetiroend. The Bhv and Vis methods define how to segment an interaction trace into utterances and their corresponding reactions. However, users frequently perform noisy behavior that is irrelevant to the goal of the task. For example, after hearing an instruction, an IF might go into the wrong room, realize the error, and leave the room. A reaction should not in- clude such irrelevant actions. In addition, IFs may accomplish the same goal using different behaviors: two different IFs may interpret “go to the pink room” by following different paths to the same destination. We would like to be able to generalize both reactions into one canonical reaction. As a result, our approach discretizes reactions into higher-level action sequences with less noise and less variation. Our discretization algorithm uses an automated planner and a planning representation of the task. This planning representation includes: (1) the task goal, (2) the actions which can be taken in the virtual world, and (3) the current state of the virtual world. Using the planning representation, the planner calculates an optimal path between the starting and ending states of the reaction, eliminating all unnecessary actions. While we use the classical planner FF (Hoffmann, 2003), our technique could also work with classical planning (Nau et al., 2004) or other techniques such as probabilistic planning (Bonet and Geffner, 2005). It is also not dependent on a particular discretization of the world in terms of actions. Now we are ready to define canonical reaction ck formally. Let Sk be the state of the virtual world when instruction uk was uttered, Sk+1 be the state of the world where the reaction ends (as defined by Bhv or Vis segmentation), and D be the planning domain representation of the virtual world. The canonical reaction to uk is defined as the sequence of actions 183 returned by the planner with Sk as initial state, Sk+1 as goal state and D as planning domain. 3.2 Interpretation phase The annotation phase results in a collection of (uk, ck) pairs. The interpretation phase uses these pairs to interpret new utterances in three steps. First, we filter the set of pairs into those whose reactions can be directly executed from the current IF position. Second, we group the filtered pairs according to their reactions. Third, we select the group with utterances most similar to the new utterance, and output that group’s reaction. Figure 2 shows the output of the first two steps: three groups of pairs whose reactions can all be executed from the IF’s current position. Figure 2: Utterance groups for this situation. Colored arrows show the reaction associated with each group. We treat the third step, selecting the most similar group for a new utterance, as a classification problem. We compare three different classification methods. One method uses nearest-neighbor classification with three different similarity metrics: Jaccard and Overlap coefficients (both of which measure the degree of overlap between two sets, differing only in the normalization of the final value (Nikravesh et al., 2005)), and Levenshtein Distance (a string met- ric for measuring the amount of differences between two sequences of words (Levenshtein, 1966)). Our second classification method employs a strategy in which we considered each group as a set of possible machine translations of our utterance, using the BLEU measure (Papineni et al., 2002) to select which group could be considered the best translation of our utterance. Finally, we trained an SVM classifier (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) using the unigrams Corpus Cm Corpus Cs Algorithm Bhv Vis Bhv Vis Jaccard47%54%54%70% Overlap BLEU SVM Levenshtein 43% 44% 33% 21% 53% 52% 29% 20% 45% 54% 45% 8% 60% 50% 29% 17% Table 1: Accuracy comparison between Cm and Cs for Bhv and Vis segmentation of each paraphrase and the position of the IF as features, and setting their group as the output class using a libSVM wrapper (Chang and Lin, 2011). When the system misinterprets an instruction we use a similar approach to what people do in order to overcome misunderstandings. If the system executes an incorrect reaction, the IG can tell the system to cancel its current interpretation and try again using a paraphrase, selecting a different reaction. 4 Evaluation For the evaluation phase, we annotated both the Cm and Cs corpora entirely, and then we split them in an 80/20 proportion; the first 80% of data collected in each virtual world was used for training, while the remaining 20% was used for testing. For each pair (uk, ck) in the testing set, we used our algorithm to predict the reaction to the selected utterance, and then compared this result against the automatically annotated reaction. Table 1 shows the results. Comparing the Bhv and Vis segmentation strategies, Vis tends to obtain better results than Bhv. In addition, accuracy on the Cs corpus was generally higher than Cm. Given that Cs contained only one IG, we believe this led to less variability in the instructions and less noise in the training data. We evaluated the impact of user corrections by simulating them using the existing corpus. In case of a wrong response, the algorithm receives a second utterance with the same reaction (a paraphrase of the previous one). Then the new utterance is tested over the same set of possible groups, except for the one which was returned before. If the correct reaction is not predicted after four tries, or there are no utterances with the same reaction, the predictions are registered as wrong. To measure the effects of user corrections vs. without, we used a different evalu184 ation process for this algorithm: first, we split the corpus in a 50/50 proportion, and then we moved correctly predicted utterances from the testing set towards training, until either there was nothing more to learn or the training set reached 80% of the entire corpus size. As expected, user corrections significantly improve accuracy, as shown in Figure 3. The worst algorithm’s results improve linearly with each try, while the best ones behave asymptotically, barely improving after the second try. The best algorithm reaches 92% with just one correction from the IG. 5 Discussion and future work We presented an approach to instruction interpretation which learns from non-annotated logs of human behavior. Our empirical analysis shows that our best algorithm achieves 70% accuracy on this task, with no manual annotation required. When corrections are added, accuracy goes up to 92% for just one correction. We consider our results promising since state of the art semi-unsupervised approaches to instruction interpretation (Chen and Mooney, 2011) reports a 55% accuracy on manually segmented data. We plan to compare our system’s performance against human performance in comparable situations. Our informal observations of the GIVE corpus indicate that humans often follow instructions incorrectly, so our automated system’s performance may be on par with human performance. Although we have presented our approach in the context of 3D virtual worlds, we believe our technique is also applicable to other domains such as the web, video games, or Human Robot Interaction.

We employ the postordering framework proposed by (Sudoh et al., 2011b) for Japanese to English translation and improve upon the reordering method. The existing post-ordering method reorders a sequence of target language words in a source language word order via SMT, while our method reorders the sequence by: 1) parsing the sequence to obtain syntax structures similar to a source language structure, and 2) transferring the obtained syntax structures into the syntax structures of the target language.</p><p>5 0.44479868 <a title="189-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-A_System_for_Real-time_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_of_2012_U.S._Presidential_Election_Cycle.html">21 acl-2012-A System for Real-time Twitter Sentiment Analysis of 2012 U.S. Presidential Election Cycle</a></p>
<p>Author: Hao Wang ; Dogan Can ; Abe Kazemzadeh ; Francois Bar ; Shrikanth Narayanan</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a system for real-time analysis of public sentiment toward presidential candidates in the 2012 U.S. election as expressed on Twitter, a microblogging service. Twitter has become a central site where people express their opinions and views on political parties and candidates. Emerging events or news are often followed almost instantly by a burst in Twitter volume, providing a unique opportunity to gauge the relation between expressed public sentiment and electoral events. In addition, sentiment analysis can help explore how these events affect public opinion. While traditional content analysis takes days or weeks to complete, the system demonstrated here analyzes sentiment in the entire Twitter traffic about the election, delivering results instantly and continuously. It offers the public, the media, politicians and scholars a new and timely perspective on the dynamics of the electoral process and public opinion. 1</p><p>6 0.43942896 <a title="189-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-The_Creation_of_a_Corpus_of_English_Metalanguage.html">195 acl-2012-The Creation of a Corpus of English Metalanguage</a></p>

<p>Author: Wen Chan ; Xiangdong Zhou ; Wei Wang ; Tat-Seng Chua</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel answer summarization method for community Question Answering services (cQAs) to address the problem of “incomplete answer”, i.e., the “best answer” of a complex multi-sentence question misses valuable information that is contained in other answers. In order to automatically generate a novel and non-redundant community answer summary, we segment the complex original multi-sentence question into several sub questions and then propose a general Conditional Random Field (CRF) based answer summary method with group L1 regularization. Various textual and non-textual QA features are explored. Specifically, we explore four different types of contextual factors, namely, the information novelty and non-redundancy modeling for local and non-local sentence interactions under question segmentation. To further unleash the potential of the abundant cQA features, we introduce the group L1 regularization for feature learning. Experimental results on a Yahoo! Answers dataset show that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on cQA summarization task.</p><p>3 0.14303175 <a title="177-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Modeling_Review_Comments.html">144 acl-2012-Modeling Review Comments</a></p>
<p>Author: Arjun Mukherjee ; Bing Liu</p><p>Abstract: Writing comments about news articles, blogs, or reviews have become a popular activity in social media. In this paper, we analyze reader comments about reviews. Analyzing review comments is important because reviews only tell the experiences and evaluations of reviewers about the reviewed products or services. Comments, on the other hand, are readers’ evaluations of reviews, their questions and concerns. Clearly, the information in comments is valuable for both future readers and brands. This paper proposes two latent variable models to simultaneously model and extract these key pieces of information. The results also enable classification of comments accurately. Experiments using Amazon review comments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models.</p><p>4 0.12656651 <a title="177-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Fast_Online_Training_with_Frequency-Adaptive_Learning_Rates_for_Chinese_Word_Segmentation_and_New_Word_Detection.html">94 acl-2012-Fast Online Training with Frequency-Adaptive Learning Rates for Chinese Word Segmentation and New Word Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xu Sun ; Houfeng Wang ; Wenjie Li</p><p>Abstract: We present a joint model for Chinese word segmentation and new word detection. We present high dimensional new features, including word-based features and enriched edge (label-transition) features, for the joint modeling. As we know, training a word segmentation system on large-scale datasets is already costly. In our case, adding high dimensional new features will further slow down the training speed. To solve this problem, we propose a new training method, adaptive online gradient descent based on feature frequency information, for very fast online training of the parameters, even given large-scale datasets with high dimensional features. Compared with existing training methods, our training method is an order magnitude faster in terms of training time, and can achieve equal or even higher accuracies. The proposed fast training method is a general purpose optimization method, and it is not limited in the specific task discussed in this paper.</p><p>5 0.12315389 <a title="177-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-A_Cost_Sensitive_Part-of-Speech_Tagging%3A_Differentiating_Serious_Errors_from_Minor_Errors.html">9 acl-2012-A Cost Sensitive Part-of-Speech Tagging: Differentiating Serious Errors from Minor Errors</a></p>
<p>Author: Hyun-Je Song ; Jeong-Woo Son ; Tae-Gil Noh ; Seong-Bae Park ; Sang-Jo Lee</p><p>Abstract: All types of part-of-speech (POS) tagging errors have been equally treated by existing taggers. However, the errors are not equally important, since some errors affect the performance of subsequent natural language processing (NLP) tasks seriously while others do not. This paper aims to minimize these serious errors while retaining the overall performance of POS tagging. Two gradient loss functions are proposed to reflect the different types of errors. They are designed to assign a larger cost to serious errors and a smaller one to minor errors. Through a set of POS tagging experiments, it is shown that the classifier trained with the proposed loss functions reduces serious errors compared to state-of-the-art POS taggers. In addition, the experimental result on text chunking shows that fewer serious errors help to improve the performance of sub- sequent NLP tasks.</p><p>6 0.12196107 <a title="177-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-IRIS%3A_a_Chat-oriented_Dialogue_System_based_on_the_Vector_Space_Model.html">114 acl-2012-IRIS: a Chat-oriented Dialogue System based on the Vector Space Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Geoffrey Zweig ; John C. Platt ; Christopher Meek ; Christopher J.C. Burges ; Ainur Yessenalina ; Qiang Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of sentencelevel semantic coherence by answering SATstyle sentence completion questions. These questions test the ability of algorithms to distinguish sense from nonsense based on a variety of sentence-level phenomena. We tackle the problem with two approaches: methods that use local lexical information, such as the n-grams of a classical language model; and methods that evaluate global coherence, such as latent semantic analysis. We evaluate these methods on a suite of practice SAT questions, and on a recently released sentence completion task based on data taken from five Conan Doyle novels. We find that by fusing local and global information, we can exceed 50% on this task (chance baseline is 20%), and we suggest some avenues for further research.</p><p>4 0.5765003 <a title="177-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-Automatically_Mining_Question_Reformulation_Patterns_from_Search_Log_Data.html">35 acl-2012-Automatically Mining Question Reformulation Patterns from Search Log Data</a></p>

However, various questions can be formulated to convey the same information need, which poses a great challenge to search systems. In this paper, we automatically mined 5w1h question reformulation patterns from large scale search log data. The question reformulations generated from these patterns are further incorporated into the retrieval model. Experiments show that using question reformulation patterns can significantly improve the search performance of natural language questions.</p><p>5 0.50549853 <a title="177-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-Modeling_Review_Comments.html">144 acl-2012-Modeling Review Comments</a></p>

<p>Author: Eduard Dragut ; Hong Wang ; Clement Yu ; Prasad Sistla ; Weiyi Meng</p><p>Abstract: Polarity classification of words is important for applications such as Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis. A number of sentiment word/sense dictionaries have been manually or (semi)automatically constructed. The dictionaries have substantial inaccuracies. Besides obvious instances, where the same word appears with different polarities in different dictionaries, the dictionaries exhibit complex cases, which cannot be detected by mere manual inspection. We introduce the concept of polarity consistency of words/senses in sentiment dictionaries in this paper. We show that the consistency problem is NP-complete. We reduce the polarity consistency problem to the satisfiability problem and utilize a fast SAT solver to detect inconsistencies in a sentiment dictionary. We perform experiments on four sentiment dictionaries and WordNet.</p><p>2 0.8508141 <a title="177-lda-2" href="./acl-2012-Text_Segmentation_by_Language_Using_Minimum_Description_Length.html">194 acl-2012-Text Segmentation by Language Using Minimum Description Length</a></p>

The problem was motivated by an attempt to collect a large amount of linguistic data for non-major languages from the web. The problem is formulated in terms of obtaining the minimum description length of a text, and the proposed solution finds the segments and their languages through dynamic programming. Empirical results demonstrating the potential of this approach are presented for experiments using texts taken from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Wikipedia, covering more than 200 languages.</p><p>3 0.83063316 <a title="177-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Multilingual_WSD_with_Just_a_Few_Lines_of_Code%3A_the_BabelNet_API.html">152 acl-2012-Multilingual WSD with Just a Few Lines of Code: the BabelNet API</a></p>

Finding dependency structure can not only help find answer quickly but also allow users to trace back how the answer is concluded through user conversations. We use linear-chain conditional random fields (CRF) for sentence type tagging, and a 2D CRF to label the dependency relation between sentences. Our experimental results show that our proposed approach performs well for sentence dependency tagging. This dependency information can benefit other tasks such as thread ranking and answer summarization in online forums.</p><p>5 0.7553044 <a title="177-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Capturing_Paradigmatic_and_Syntagmatic_Lexical_Relations%3A_Towards_Accurate_Chinese_Part-of-Speech_Tagging.html">45 acl-2012-Capturing Paradigmatic and Syntagmatic Lexical Relations: Towards Accurate Chinese Part-of-Speech Tagging</a></p>
<p>Author: Weiwei Sun ; Hans Uszkoreit</p><p>Abstract: From the perspective of structural linguistics, we explore paradigmatic and syntagmatic lexical relations for Chinese POS tagging, an important and challenging task for Chinese language processing. Paradigmatic lexical relations are explicitly captured by word clustering on large-scale unlabeled data and are used to design new features to enhance a discriminative tagger. Syntagmatic lexical relations are implicitly captured by constituent parsing and are utilized via system combination. Experiments on the Penn Chinese Treebank demonstrate the importance of both paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations. Our linguistically motivated approaches yield a relative error reduction of 18% in total over a stateof-the-art baseline.</p><p>6 0.74607426 <a title="177-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Exploiting_Multiple_Treebanks_for_Parsing_with_Quasi-synchronous_Grammars.html">87 acl-2012-Exploiting Multiple Treebanks for Parsing with Quasi-synchronous Grammars</a></p>

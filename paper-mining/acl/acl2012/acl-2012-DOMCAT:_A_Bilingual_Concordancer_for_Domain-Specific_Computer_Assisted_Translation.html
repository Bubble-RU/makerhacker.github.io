<p>Author: Graham Neubig ; Taro Watanabe ; Shinsuke Mori ; Tatsuya Kawahara</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that accurate machine translation is possible without the concept of “words,” treating MT as a problem of transformation between character strings. We achieve this result by applying phrasal inversion transduction grammar alignment techniques to character strings to train a character-based translation model, and using this in the phrase-based MT framework. We also propose a look-ahead parsing algorithm and substring-informed prior probabilities to achieve more effective and efficient alignment. In an evaluation, we demonstrate that character-based translation can achieve results that compare to word-based systems while effectively translating unknown and uncommon words over several language pairs.</p><p>4 0.13696782 <a title="66-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-An_Exploration_of_Forest-to-String_Translation%3A_Does_Translation_Help_or_Hurt_Parsing%3F.html">25 acl-2012-An Exploration of Forest-to-String Translation: Does Translation Help or Hurt Parsing?</a></p>
<p>Author: Hui Zhang ; David Chiang</p><p>Abstract: Syntax-based translation models that operate on the output of a source-language parser have been shown to perform better if allowed to choose from a set of possible parses. In this paper, we investigate whether this is because it allows the translation stage to overcome parser errors or to override the syntactic structure itself. We find that it is primarily the latter, but that under the right conditions, the translation stage does correct parser errors, improving parsing accuracy on the Chinese Treebank.</p><p>5 0.12347944 <a title="66-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Maximum_Expected_BLEU_Training_of_Phrase_and_Lexicon_Translation_Models.html">141 acl-2012-Maximum Expected BLEU Training of Phrase and Lexicon Translation Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaodong He ; Li Deng</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new discriminative training method in constructing phrase and lexicon translation models. In order to reliably learn a myriad of parameters in these models, we propose an expected BLEU score-based utility function with KL regularization as the objective, and train the models on a large parallel dataset. For training, we derive growth transformations for phrase and lexicon translation probabilities to iteratively improve the objective. The proposed method, evaluated on the Europarl German-to-English dataset, leads to a 1.1 BLEU point improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline translation system. In IWSLT 201 1 Benchmark, our system using the proposed method achieves the best Chinese-to-English translation result on the task of translating TED talks.</p><p>6 0.11895975 <a title="66-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Deciphering_Foreign_Language_by_Combining_Language_Models_and_Context_Vectors.html">67 acl-2012-Deciphering Foreign Language by Combining Language Models and Context Vectors</a></p>

<p>Author: Chang Liu ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce the TESLACELAB metric (Translation Evaluation of Sentences with Linear-programming-based Analysis Character-level Evaluation for Languages with Ambiguous word Boundaries) for automatic machine translation evaluation. For languages such as Chinese where words usually have meaningful internal structure and word boundaries are often fuzzy, TESLA-CELAB acknowledges the advantage of character-level evaluation over word-level evaluation. By reformulating the problem in the linear programming framework, TESLACELAB addresses several drawbacks of the character-level metrics, in particular the modeling of synonyms spanning multiple characters. We show empirically that TESLACELAB significantly outperforms characterlevel BLEU in the English-Chinese translation evaluation tasks. –</p><p>4 0.45166904 <a title="66-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-NiuTrans%3A_An_Open_Source_Toolkit_for_Phrase-based_and_Syntax-based_Machine_Translation.html">155 acl-2012-NiuTrans: An Open Source Toolkit for Phrase-based and Syntax-based Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Xiao ; Jingbo Zhu ; Hao Zhang ; Qiang Li</p><p>Abstract: We present a new open source toolkit for phrase-based and syntax-based machine translation. The toolkit supports several state-of-the-art models developed in statistical machine translation, including the phrase-based model, the hierachical phrase-based model, and various syntaxbased models. The key innovation provided by the toolkit is that the decoder can work with various grammars and offers different choices of decoding algrithms, such as phrase-based decoding, decoding as parsing/tree-parsing and forest-based decoding. Moreover, several useful utilities were distributed with the toolkit, including a discriminative reordering model, a simple and fast language model, and an implementation of minimum error rate training for weight tuning. 1</p><p>5 0.44911832 <a title="66-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Mixing_Multiple_Translation_Models_in_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">143 acl-2012-Mixing Multiple Translation Models in Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Majid Razmara ; George Foster ; Baskaran Sankaran ; Anoop Sarkar</p><p>Abstract: Statistical machine translation is often faced with the problem of combining training data from many diverse sources into a single translation model which then has to translate sentences in a new domain. We propose a novel approach, ensemble decoding, which combines a number of translation systems dynamically at the decoding step. In this paper, we evaluate performance on a domain adaptation setting where we translate sentences from the medical domain. Our experimental results show that ensemble decoding outperforms various strong baselines including mixture models, the current state-of-the-art for domain adaptation in machine translation.</p><p>6 0.44615188 <a title="66-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-A_Class-Based_Agreement_Model_for_Generating_Accurately_Inflected_Translations.html">3 acl-2012-A Class-Based Agreement Model for Generating Accurately Inflected Translations</a></p>

<h1>197 acl-2012-Tokenization: Returning to a Long Solved Problem  A Survey, Contrastive Experiment, Recommendations, and Toolkit </h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2012-197-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P12/P12-2074.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Rebecca Dridan ; Stephan Oepen</p><p>Abstract: We examine some of the frequently disregarded subtleties of tokenization in Penn Treebank style, and present a new rule-based preprocessing toolkit that not only reproduces the Treebank tokenization with unmatched accuracy, but also maintains exact stand-off pointers to the original text and allows flexible configuration to diverse use cases (e.g. to genreor domain-specific idiosyncrasies). 1 Introduction—Motivation The task of tokenization is hardly counted among the grand challenges of NLP and is conventionally interpreted as breaking up “natural language text [...] into distinct meaningful units (or tokens)” (Kaplan, 2005). Practically speaking, however, tokenization is often combined with other string-level preprocessing—for example normalization of punctuation (of different conventions for dashes, say), disambiguation of quotation marks (into opening vs. closing quotes), or removal of unwanted mark-up— where the specifics of such pre-processing depend both on properties of the input text as well as on assumptions made in downstream processing. Applying some string-level normalizationprior to the identification of token boundaries can improve (or simplify) tokenization, and a sub-task like the disambiguation of quote marks would in fact be hard to perform after tokenization, seeing that it depends on adjacency to whitespace. In the following, we thus assume a generalized notion of tokenization, comprising all string-level processing up to and including the conversion of a sequence of characters (a string) to a sequence of token objects.1 1Obviously, some of the normalization we include in the tokenization task (in this generalized interpretation) could be left to downstream analysis, where a tagger or parser, for example, could be expected to accept non-disambiguated quote marks (so-called straight or typewriter quotes) and disambiguate as 378 Arguably, even in an overtly ‘separating’ language like English, there can be token-level ambiguities that ultimately can only be resolved through parsing (see § 3 for candidate examples), and indeed Waldron et al. (2006) entertain the idea of downstream processing on a token lattice. In this article, however, we accept the tokenization conventions and sequential nature of the Penn Treebank (PTB; Marcus et al., 1993) as a useful point of reference— primarily for interoperability of different NLP tools. Still, we argue, there is remaining work to be done on PTB-compliant tokenization (reviewed in§ 2), both methodologically, practically, and technologically. In § 3 we observe that state-of-the-art tools perform poorly on re-creating PTB tokenization, and move on in § 4 to develop a modular, parameterizable, and transparent framework for tokenization. Besides improvements in tokenization accuracy and adaptability to diverse use cases, in § 5 we further argue that each token object should unambiguously link back to an underlying element of the original input, which in the case of tokenization of text we realize through a notion of characterization. 2 Common Conventions Due to the popularity of the PTB, its tokenization has been a de-facto standard for two decades. Ap- proximately, this means splitting off punctuation into separate tokens, disambiguating straight quotes, and separating contractions such as can’t into ca and n ’t. There are, however, many special cases— part of syntactic analysis. However, on the (predominant) point of view that punctuation marks form tokens in their own right, the tokenizer would then have to adorn quote marks in some way, as to whether they were split off the left or right periphery of a larger token, to avoid unwanted syntactic ambiguity. Further, increasing use of Unicode makes texts containing ‘natively’ disambiguated quotes more common, where it would seem unfortunate to discard linguistically pertinent information by normalizing towards the poverty of pure ASCII punctuation.

In much tagging and parsing work, PTB data has been used with gold-standard tokens, to a point where many researchers are unaware of the existence of the original ‘raw’ (untokenized) text. Accordingly, the formal definition of PTB has received little attention, but reproducing PTB tokenization automatically actually is not a trivial task (see § 3). As the NLP community has moved to process data other than the PTB, some of the limitations of the tokenization2 PTB tokenization have been recognized, and many recently released data sets are accompanied by a note on tokenization along the lines of: Tokenization is similar to that used in PTB, except . . . Most exceptions are to do with hyphenation, or special forms of named entities such as chemical names or URLs. None of the documentation with extant data sets is sufficient to fully reproduce the tokenization.3 The CoNLL 2008 Shared Task data actually provided two forms of tokenization: that from the PTB (which many pre-processing tools would have been trained on), and another form that splits (most) hyphenated terms. This latter convention recently seems to be gaining ground in data sets like the Google 1T n-gram corpus (LDC #2006T13) and OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006). Clearly, as one moves towards a more application- and domaindriven idea of ‘correct’ tokenization, a more transparent, flexible, and adaptable approach to stringlevel pre-processing is called for. 3 A Contrastive Experiment To get an overview of current tokenization methods, we recovered and tokenized the raw text which was the source of the (Wall Street Journal portion of the) PTB, and compared it to the gold tokenization in the syntactic annotation in the We used three common methods of tokenization: (a) the original treebank.4 2See http : / /www . cis .upenn .edu/ ~t reebank/ t okeni z at ion .html for available ‘documentation’ and a sed script for PTB-style tokenization. 3Øvrelid et al. (2010) observe that tokenizing with the GENIA tagger yields mismatches in one of five sentences of the GENIA Treebank, although the GENIA guidelines refer to scripts that may be available on request (Tateisi & Tsujii, 2006). 4The original WSJ text was last included with the 1995 release of the PTB (LDC #95T07) and required alignment with the treebank, with some manual correction so that the same text is represented in both raw and parsed formats. 379 Tokenization Differing Levenshtein Method Sentences Distance tokenizer.sed 3264 11168 CoreNLP 1781 3717 C&J; parser 2597 4516 Table 1: Quantitative view on tokenization differences. PTB tokenizer.sed script; (b) the tokenizer from the Stanford CoreNLP tools5; and (c) tokenization from the parser of Charniak & Johnson (2005). Table 1 shows quantitative differences between each of the three methods and the PTB, both in terms of the number of sentences where the tokenization differs, and also in the total Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein, 1966) over tokens (for a total of 49,208 sentences and 1,173,750 gold-standard tokens). Looking at the differences qualitatively, the most consistent issue across all tokenization methods was ambiguity of sentence-final periods. In the treebank, final periods are always (with about 10 exceptions) a separate token. If the sentence ends in U.S. (but not other abbreviations, oddly), an extra period is hallucinated, so the abbreviation also has one. In contrast, C&J; add a period to all final abbreviations, CoreNLP groups the final period with a final abbreviation and hence lacks a sentence-final period token, and the sed script strips the period off U.S. The ‘correct’ choice in this case is not obvious and will depend on how the tokens are to be used. The majority of the discrepancies in the sed script tokenization come from an under-restricted punctuation rule that incorrectly splits on commas within numbers or ampersands within names. Other than that, the problematic cases are mostly shared across tokenization methods, and include issues with currencies, Irish names, hyphenization, and quote disambiguation. In addition, C&J; make some additional modifications to the text, lemmatising expressions such as won ’t as will and n ’t. 4 REPP: A Generalized Framework For tokenization to be studied as a first-class problem, and to enable customization and flexibility to diverse use cases, we suggest a non-procedural, rule-based framework dubbed REPP (Regular 5See corenlp / / nlp . st anford . edu / so ftware / run in ‘ st rict Treebank3 ’ mode. http : . shtml, Expression-Based Pre-Processing)—essentially a cascade of ordered finite-state string rewriting rules, though transcending the formal complexity of regular languages by inclusion of (a) full perl-compatible regular expressions and (b) fixpoint iteration over groups of rules. In this approach, a first phase of string-level substitutions inserts whitespace around, for example, punctuation marks; upon completion of string rewriting, token boundaries are stipulated between all whitespace-separated substrings (and only these). For a good balance of human and machine readability, REPP tokenization rules are specified in a simple, line-oriented textual form. Figure 1 shows a (simplified) excerpt from our PTB-style tokenizer, where the first character on each line is one of four REPP operators, as follows: (a) ‘#’ for group formation; (b) ‘>’ for group invocation, (c) ‘ ! ’ for substitution (allowing capture groups), and (d) ‘ : ’ for token boundary detection.6 In Figure 1, the two rules stripping off prefix and suffix punctuation marks adjacent to whitespace (i.e. matching the tab-separated left-hand side of the rule, to replace the match with its right-hand side) form a numbered group (‘# 1’), which will be iterated when called (‘> 1 until none ’) of the rules in the group fires (a fixpoint). In this example, conditioning on whitespace adjacency avoids the issues observed with the PTB sed script (e.g. token boundaries within comma-separated numbers) and also protects against infinite loops in the group.7 REPP rule sets can be organized as modules, typ6Strictly speaking, there are another two operators, for lineoriented comments and automated versioning of rule files. 7For this example, the same effects seemingly could be obtained without iteration (using greatly more complex rules); our actual, non-simplified rules, however, further deal with punctuation marks that can function as prefixes or suffixes, as well as with corner cases like factor(s) or Ca[2+]. Also in mark-up removal and normalization, we have found it necessary to ‘parse’ nested structures by means of iterative groups. 380 ically each in a file of its own, and invoked selectively by name (e.g. ‘>wiki’ in Figure 1); to date, there exist modules for quote disambiguation, (relevant subsets of) various mark-up languages (HTML, LATEX, wiki, and XML), and a handful of robustness rules (e.g. seeking to identify and repair ‘sandwiched’ inter-token punctuation). Individual tokenizers are configured at run-time, by selectively activating a set of modules (through command-line op- tions). An open-source reference implementation of the REPP framework (in C++) is available, together with a library of modules for English. 5 Characterization for Traceability Tokenization, and specifically our notion of generalized tokenization which allows text normalization, involves changes to the original text being analyzed, rather than just additional annotation. As such, full traceability from the token objects to the original text is required, which we formalize as ‘characterization’, in terms of character position links back to the source.8 This has the practical benefit of allowing downstream analysis as direct (stand-off) annotation on the source text, as seen for example in the ACL Anthology Searchbench (Schäfer et al., 2011). With our general regular expression replacement rules in REPP, making precise what it means for a token to link back to its ‘underlying’ substring requires some care in the design and implementation. Definite characterization links between the string before (I) and after (O) the application of a single orurele ( can only bftee res (tOab)li tshheed a pinp lcicerattiaoinn positions, viz.

Each character in the string being processed has a start and end position, marking the point before and after the character in the original string. Before processing, the end position would always be one greater than the start position. However, if a rule mapped a string-initial, PTB-style opening double quote (``) to one-character Unicode “, the new first character of the string would have start position 0, but end position 2. In contrast, if there were a rule !wo (n’ t ) will \1 (1) applied to the string I ’t go!, all characters in the won second token of the resulting string (I will n’t go!) will have start position 2 and end position 4.

When repeating the experiment of § 3 above using REPP tokenization, we obtained an initial difference in 1505 sentences, with a Levenshtein dis10This subtlety will actually be invisible in the final token objects if will remains a single token, but if subsequent rules were to split this token further, all its output tokens would have a start position of 2 and an end position of 4. While this example may seem unlikely, we have come across similar scenarios in fine-tuning actual REPP rules. 381 tance of 3543 (broadly comparable to CoreNLP, if marginally more accurate). Examining these discrepancies, we revealed some deficiencies in our rules, as well as some peculiarities of the ‘raw’ Wall Street Journal text from the PTB distribution. A little more than 200 mismatches were owed to improper treatment of currency symbols (AU$) and decade abbreviations (’60s), which led to the refinement of two existing rules. Notable PTB idiosyncrasies (in the sense of deviations from common typography) include ellipses with spaces separating the periods and a fairly large number of possessives (’s) being separated from their preceding token. Other aspects of gold-standard PTB tokenization we consider unwarranted ‘damage’ to the input text, such as hallucinating an extra period after U . S . and splitting cannot (which adds spurious ambiguity). For use cases where the goal were strict compliance, for instance in pre-processing inputs for a PTB-derived parser, we added an optional REPP module (of currently half a dozen rules) to cater to these corner cases—in a spirit similar to the CoreNLP mode we used in § 3. With these extra rules, remaining tokenization discrepancies are contained in 603 sentences (just over 1%), which gives a Levenshtein distance of 1389. 7 Discussion—Conclusion Compared to the best-performing off-the-shelf system in our earlier experiment (where it is reasonable to assume that PTB data has played at least some role in development), our results eliminate two thirds of the remaining tokenization errors—a more substantial reduction than recent improvements in parsing accuracy against the PTB, for example.

The final 200 or so dif- ferences stem from manual corrections made during treebanking, and we consider that these cases could not be replicated automatically in any generalizable fashion.

<p>Author: Rebecca Dridan ; Stephan Oepen</p><p>Abstract: We examine some of the frequently disregarded subtleties of tokenization in Penn Treebank style, and present a new rule-based preprocessing toolkit that not only reproduces the Treebank tokenization with unmatched accuracy, but also maintains exact stand-off pointers to the original text and allows flexible configuration to diverse use cases (e.g. to genreor domain-specific idiosyncrasies). 1 Introduction—Motivation The task of tokenization is hardly counted among the grand challenges of NLP and is conventionally interpreted as breaking up “natural language text [...] into distinct meaningful units (or tokens)” (Kaplan, 2005). Practically speaking, however, tokenization is often combined with other string-level preprocessing—for example normalization of punctuation (of different conventions for dashes, say), disambiguation of quotation marks (into opening vs. closing quotes), or removal of unwanted mark-up— where the specifics of such pre-processing depend both on properties of the input text as well as on assumptions made in downstream processing. Applying some string-level normalizationprior to the identification of token boundaries can improve (or simplify) tokenization, and a sub-task like the disambiguation of quote marks would in fact be hard to perform after tokenization, seeing that it depends on adjacency to whitespace. In the following, we thus assume a generalized notion of tokenization, comprising all string-level processing up to and including the conversion of a sequence of characters (a string) to a sequence of token objects.1 1Obviously, some of the normalization we include in the tokenization task (in this generalized interpretation) could be left to downstream analysis, where a tagger or parser, for example, could be expected to accept non-disambiguated quote marks (so-called straight or typewriter quotes) and disambiguate as 378 Arguably, even in an overtly ‘separating’ language like English, there can be token-level ambiguities that ultimately can only be resolved through parsing (see § 3 for candidate examples), and indeed Waldron et al. (2006) entertain the idea of downstream processing on a token lattice. In this article, however, we accept the tokenization conventions and sequential nature of the Penn Treebank (PTB; Marcus et al., 1993) as a useful point of reference— primarily for interoperability of different NLP tools. Still, we argue, there is remaining work to be done on PTB-compliant tokenization (reviewed in§ 2), both methodologically, practically, and technologically. In § 3 we observe that state-of-the-art tools perform poorly on re-creating PTB tokenization, and move on in § 4 to develop a modular, parameterizable, and transparent framework for tokenization. Besides improvements in tokenization accuracy and adaptability to diverse use cases, in § 5 we further argue that each token object should unambiguously link back to an underlying element of the original input, which in the case of tokenization of text we realize through a notion of characterization. 2 Common Conventions Due to the popularity of the PTB, its tokenization has been a de-facto standard for two decades. Ap- proximately, this means splitting off punctuation into separate tokens, disambiguating straight quotes, and separating contractions such as can’t into ca and n ’t. There are, however, many special cases— part of syntactic analysis. However, on the (predominant) point of view that punctuation marks form tokens in their own right, the tokenizer would then have to adorn quote marks in some way, as to whether they were split off the left or right periphery of a larger token, to avoid unwanted syntactic ambiguity. Further, increasing use of Unicode makes texts containing ‘natively’ disambiguated quotes more common, where it would seem unfortunate to discard linguistically pertinent information by normalizing towards the poverty of pure ASCII punctuation.

In much tagging and parsing work, PTB data has been used with gold-standard tokens, to a point where many researchers are unaware of the existence of the original ‘raw’ (untokenized) text. Accordingly, the formal definition of PTB has received little attention, but reproducing PTB tokenization automatically actually is not a trivial task (see § 3). As the NLP community has moved to process data other than the PTB, some of the limitations of the tokenization2 PTB tokenization have been recognized, and many recently released data sets are accompanied by a note on tokenization along the lines of: Tokenization is similar to that used in PTB, except . . . Most exceptions are to do with hyphenation, or special forms of named entities such as chemical names or URLs. None of the documentation with extant data sets is sufficient to fully reproduce the tokenization.3 The CoNLL 2008 Shared Task data actually provided two forms of tokenization: that from the PTB (which many pre-processing tools would have been trained on), and another form that splits (most) hyphenated terms. This latter convention recently seems to be gaining ground in data sets like the Google 1T n-gram corpus (LDC #2006T13) and OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006). Clearly, as one moves towards a more application- and domaindriven idea of ‘correct’ tokenization, a more transparent, flexible, and adaptable approach to stringlevel pre-processing is called for. 3 A Contrastive Experiment To get an overview of current tokenization methods, we recovered and tokenized the raw text which was the source of the (Wall Street Journal portion of the) PTB, and compared it to the gold tokenization in the syntactic annotation in the We used three common methods of tokenization: (a) the original treebank.4 2See http : / /www . cis .upenn .edu/ ~t reebank/ t okeni z at ion .html for available ‘documentation’ and a sed script for PTB-style tokenization. 3Øvrelid et al. (2010) observe that tokenizing with the GENIA tagger yields mismatches in one of five sentences of the GENIA Treebank, although the GENIA guidelines refer to scripts that may be available on request (Tateisi & Tsujii, 2006). 4The original WSJ text was last included with the 1995 release of the PTB (LDC #95T07) and required alignment with the treebank, with some manual correction so that the same text is represented in both raw and parsed formats. 379 Tokenization Differing Levenshtein Method Sentences Distance tokenizer.sed 3264 11168 CoreNLP 1781 3717 C&J; parser 2597 4516 Table 1: Quantitative view on tokenization differences. PTB tokenizer.sed script; (b) the tokenizer from the Stanford CoreNLP tools5; and (c) tokenization from the parser of Charniak & Johnson (2005). Table 1 shows quantitative differences between each of the three methods and the PTB, both in terms of the number of sentences where the tokenization differs, and also in the total Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein, 1966) over tokens (for a total of 49,208 sentences and 1,173,750 gold-standard tokens). Looking at the differences qualitatively, the most consistent issue across all tokenization methods was ambiguity of sentence-final periods. In the treebank, final periods are always (with about 10 exceptions) a separate token. If the sentence ends in U.S. (but not other abbreviations, oddly), an extra period is hallucinated, so the abbreviation also has one. In contrast, C&J; add a period to all final abbreviations, CoreNLP groups the final period with a final abbreviation and hence lacks a sentence-final period token, and the sed script strips the period off U.S. The ‘correct’ choice in this case is not obvious and will depend on how the tokens are to be used. The majority of the discrepancies in the sed script tokenization come from an under-restricted punctuation rule that incorrectly splits on commas within numbers or ampersands within names. Other than that, the problematic cases are mostly shared across tokenization methods, and include issues with currencies, Irish names, hyphenization, and quote disambiguation. In addition, C&J; make some additional modifications to the text, lemmatising expressions such as won ’t as will and n ’t. 4 REPP: A Generalized Framework For tokenization to be studied as a first-class problem, and to enable customization and flexibility to diverse use cases, we suggest a non-procedural, rule-based framework dubbed REPP (Regular 5See corenlp / / nlp . st anford . edu / so ftware / run in ‘ st rict Treebank3 ’ mode. http : . shtml, Expression-Based Pre-Processing)—essentially a cascade of ordered finite-state string rewriting rules, though transcending the formal complexity of regular languages by inclusion of (a) full perl-compatible regular expressions and (b) fixpoint iteration over groups of rules. In this approach, a first phase of string-level substitutions inserts whitespace around, for example, punctuation marks; upon completion of string rewriting, token boundaries are stipulated between all whitespace-separated substrings (and only these). For a good balance of human and machine readability, REPP tokenization rules are specified in a simple, line-oriented textual form. Figure 1 shows a (simplified) excerpt from our PTB-style tokenizer, where the first character on each line is one of four REPP operators, as follows: (a) ‘#’ for group formation; (b) ‘>’ for group invocation, (c) ‘ ! ’ for substitution (allowing capture groups), and (d) ‘ : ’ for token boundary detection.6 In Figure 1, the two rules stripping off prefix and suffix punctuation marks adjacent to whitespace (i.e. matching the tab-separated left-hand side of the rule, to replace the match with its right-hand side) form a numbered group (‘# 1’), which will be iterated when called (‘> 1 until none ’) of the rules in the group fires (a fixpoint). In this example, conditioning on whitespace adjacency avoids the issues observed with the PTB sed script (e.g. token boundaries within comma-separated numbers) and also protects against infinite loops in the group.7 REPP rule sets can be organized as modules, typ6Strictly speaking, there are another two operators, for lineoriented comments and automated versioning of rule files. 7For this example, the same effects seemingly could be obtained without iteration (using greatly more complex rules); our actual, non-simplified rules, however, further deal with punctuation marks that can function as prefixes or suffixes, as well as with corner cases like factor(s) or Ca[2+]. Also in mark-up removal and normalization, we have found it necessary to ‘parse’ nested structures by means of iterative groups. 380 ically each in a file of its own, and invoked selectively by name (e.g. ‘>wiki’ in Figure 1); to date, there exist modules for quote disambiguation, (relevant subsets of) various mark-up languages (HTML, LATEX, wiki, and XML), and a handful of robustness rules (e.g. seeking to identify and repair ‘sandwiched’ inter-token punctuation). Individual tokenizers are configured at run-time, by selectively activating a set of modules (through command-line op- tions). An open-source reference implementation of the REPP framework (in C++) is available, together with a library of modules for English. 5 Characterization for Traceability Tokenization, and specifically our notion of generalized tokenization which allows text normalization, involves changes to the original text being analyzed, rather than just additional annotation. As such, full traceability from the token objects to the original text is required, which we formalize as ‘characterization’, in terms of character position links back to the source.8 This has the practical benefit of allowing downstream analysis as direct (stand-off) annotation on the source text, as seen for example in the ACL Anthology Searchbench (Schäfer et al., 2011). With our general regular expression replacement rules in REPP, making precise what it means for a token to link back to its ‘underlying’ substring requires some care in the design and implementation. Definite characterization links between the string before (I) and after (O) the application of a single orurele ( can only bftee res (tOab)li tshheed a pinp lcicerattiaoinn positions, viz.

Each character in the string being processed has a start and end position, marking the point before and after the character in the original string. Before processing, the end position would always be one greater than the start position. However, if a rule mapped a string-initial, PTB-style opening double quote (``) to one-character Unicode “, the new first character of the string would have start position 0, but end position 2. In contrast, if there were a rule !wo (n’ t ) will \1 (1) applied to the string I ’t go!, all characters in the won second token of the resulting string (I will n’t go!) will have start position 2 and end position 4.

When repeating the experiment of § 3 above using REPP tokenization, we obtained an initial difference in 1505 sentences, with a Levenshtein dis10This subtlety will actually be invisible in the final token objects if will remains a single token, but if subsequent rules were to split this token further, all its output tokens would have a start position of 2 and an end position of 4. While this example may seem unlikely, we have come across similar scenarios in fine-tuning actual REPP rules. 381 tance of 3543 (broadly comparable to CoreNLP, if marginally more accurate). Examining these discrepancies, we revealed some deficiencies in our rules, as well as some peculiarities of the ‘raw’ Wall Street Journal text from the PTB distribution. A little more than 200 mismatches were owed to improper treatment of currency symbols (AU$) and decade abbreviations (’60s), which led to the refinement of two existing rules. Notable PTB idiosyncrasies (in the sense of deviations from common typography) include ellipses with spaces separating the periods and a fairly large number of possessives (’s) being separated from their preceding token. Other aspects of gold-standard PTB tokenization we consider unwarranted ‘damage’ to the input text, such as hallucinating an extra period after U . S . and splitting cannot (which adds spurious ambiguity). For use cases where the goal were strict compliance, for instance in pre-processing inputs for a PTB-derived parser, we added an optional REPP module (of currently half a dozen rules) to cater to these corner cases—in a spirit similar to the CoreNLP mode we used in § 3. With these extra rules, remaining tokenization discrepancies are contained in 603 sentences (just over 1%), which gives a Levenshtein distance of 1389. 7 Discussion—Conclusion Compared to the best-performing off-the-shelf system in our earlier experiment (where it is reasonable to assume that PTB data has played at least some role in development), our results eliminate two thirds of the remaining tokenization errors—a more substantial reduction than recent improvements in parsing accuracy against the PTB, for example. Of the remaining differences, cerned with mid-sentence at least half of those riod was separated treebank—a pattern Some differences over 350 are con- period ambiguity, are instances where where from an abbreviation a pein the we do not wish to emulate. in quote disambiguation also re- main, often triggered by whitespace on both sides of quote marks in the raw text. The final 200 or so dif- ferences stem from manual corrections made during treebanking, and we consider that these cases could not be replicated automatically in any generalizable fashion.

<p>Author: Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil ; Justin Cheng ; Jon Kleinberg ; Lillian Lee</p><p>Abstract: Understanding the ways in which information achieves widespread public awareness is a research question of significant interest. We consider whether, and how, the way in which the information is phrased the choice of words and sentence structure — can affect this process. To this end, we develop an analysis framework and build a corpus of movie quotes, annotated with memorability information, in which we are able to control for both the speaker and the setting of the quotes. We find that there are significant differences between memorable and non-memorable quotes in several key dimensions, even after controlling for situational and contextual factors. One is lexical distinctiveness: in aggregate, memorable quotes use less common word choices, but at the same time are built upon a scaffolding of common syntactic patterns. Another is that memorable quotes tend to be more general in ways that make them easy to apply in new contexts — that is, more portable. — We also show how the concept of “memorable language” can be extended across domains. 1 Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. Understanding what items will be retained in the public consciousness, and why, is a question of fundamental interest in many domains, including marketing, politics, entertainment, and social media; as we all know, many items barely register, whereas others catch on and take hold in many people’s minds. An active line of recent computational work has employed a variety of perspectives on this question. 892 Building on a foundation in the sociology of diffusion [27, 31], researchers have explored the ways in which network structure affects the way information spreads, with domains of interest including blogs [1, 11], email [37], on-line commerce [22], and social media [2, 28, 33, 38]. There has also been recent research addressing temporal aspects of how different media sources convey information [23, 30, 39] and ways in which people react differently to infor- mation on different topics [28, 36]. Beyond all these factors, however, one’s everyday experience with these domains suggests that the way in which a piece of information is expressed the choice of words, the way it is phrased might also have a fundamental effect on the extent to which it takes hold in people’s minds. Concepts that attain wide reach are often carried in messages such as political slogans, marketing phrases, or aphorisms whose language seems intuitively to be memorable, “catchy,” or otherwise compelling. Our first challenge in exploring this hypothesis is to develop a notion of “successful” language that is precise enough to allow for quantitative evaluation. We also face the challenge of devising an evaluation setting that separates the phrasing of a message from the conditions in which it was delivered highlycited quotes tend to have been delivered under compelling circumstances or fit an existing cultural, political, or social narrative, and potentially what appeals to us about the quote is really just its invocation of these extra-linguistic contexts. Is the form of the language adding an effect beyond or independent of these (obviously very crucial) factors? To — — — investigate the question, one needs a way of controlProce dJienjgus, R ofep thueb 5lic0t hof A Knonruea ,l M 8-e1e4ti Jnugly o f2 t0h1e2 A.s ?c so2c0ia1t2io Ans fso rc Ciatoiomnp fuotart Cio nmaplu Ltiantgiounisatlic Lsi,n pgaugiestsi8c 9s2–901, ling as much as possible for the role that the surrounding context of the language plays. — — The present work (i): Evaluating language-based memorability Defining what makes an utterance memorable is subtle, and scholars in several domains have written about this question. There is a rough consensus that an appropriate definition involves elements of both recognition people should be able to retain the quote and recognize it when they hear it invoked and production people should be motivated to refer to it in relevant situations [15]. One suggested reason for why some memes succeed is their ability to provoke emotions [16]. Alternatively, memorable quotes can be good for expressing the feelings, mood, or situation of an individual, a group, or a culture (the zeitgeist): “Certain quotes exquisitely capture the mood or feeling we wish to communicate to someone. We hear them ... and store them away for future use” [10]. None of these observations, however, serve as definitions, and indeed, we believe it desirable to — — — not pre-commit to an abstract definition, but rather to adopt an operational formulation based on external human judgments. In designing our study, we focus on a domain in which (i) there is rich use of language, some of which has achieved deep cultural penetration; (ii) there already exist a large number of external human judgments perhaps implicit, but in a form we can extract; and (iii) we can control for the setting in which the text was used. Specifically, we use the complete scripts of roughly 1000 movies, representing diverse genres, eras, and levels of popularity, and consider which lines are the most “memorable”. To acquire memorability labels, for each sentence in each script, we determine whether it has been listed as a “memorable quote” by users of the widely-known IMDb (the Internet Movie Database), and also estimate the number oftimes it appears on the Web. Both ofthese serve as memorability metrics for our purposes. When we evaluate properties of memorable quotes, we comparethemwithquotes thatarenotassessed as memorable, but were spoken by the same character, at approximately the same point in the same movie. This enables us to control in a fairly — fine-grained way for the confounding effects of context discussed above: we can observe differences 893 that persist even after taking into account both the speaker and the setting. In a pilot validation study, we find that human subjects are effective at recognizing the more IMDbmemorable of two quotes, even for movies they have not seen. This motivates a search for features intrinsic to the text of quotes that signal memorability. In fact, comments provided by the human subjects as part of the task suggested two basic forms that such textual signals could take: subjects felt that (i) memorable quotes often involve a distinctive turn of phrase; and (ii) memorable quotes tend to invoke general themes that aren’t tied to the specific setting they came from, and hence can be more easily invoked for future (out of context) uses. We test both of these principles in our analysis of the data. The present work (ii): What distinguishes memorable quotes Under the controlled-comparison setting sketched above, we find that memorable quotes exhibit significant differences from nonmemorable quotes in several fundamental respects, and these differences in the data reinforce the two main principles from the human pilot study. First, we show a concrete sense in which memorable quotes are indeed distinctive: with respect to lexical language models trained on the newswire portions of the Brown corpus [21], memorable quotes have significantly lower likelihood than their nonmemorable counterparts. Interestingly, this distinctiveness takes place at the level of words, but not at the level of other syntactic features: the part-ofspeech composition of memorable quotes is in fact more likely with respect to newswire. Thus, we can think of memorable quotes as consisting, in an aggregate sense, of unusual word choices built on a scaffolding of common part-of-speech patterns. We also identify a number of ways in which memorable quotes convey greater generality. In their patterns of verb tenses, personal pronouns, and determiners, memorable quotes are structured so as to be more “free-standing,” containing fewer markers that indicate references to nearby text. Memorable quotes differ in other interesting as- pects as well, such as sound distributions. Our analysis ofmemorable movie quotes suggests a framework by which the memorability of text in a range of different domains could be investigated. We provide evidence that such cross-domain properties may hold, guided by one of our motivating applications in marketing. In particular, we analyze a corpus of advertising slogans, and we show that these slogans have significantly greater likelihood at both the word level and the part-of-speech level with respect to a language model trained on memorable movie quotes, compared to a corresponding language model trained on non-memorable movie quotes. This suggests that some of the principles underlying memorable text have the potential to apply across different areas.

Following [8], we constructed a corpus consisting of all lines from roughly 1000 movies, varying in genre, era, and popularity; for each movie, we then extracted the list of quotes from IMDb’s Memorable Quotes page corresponding to the movie.1 A memorable quote in IMDb can appear either as an individual sentence spoken by one character, or as a multi-sentence line, or as a block of dialogue involving multiple characters. In the latter two cases, it can be hard to determine which particular portion is viewed as memorable (some involve a build-up to a punch line; others involve the follow-through after a well-phrased opening sentence), and so we focus in our comparisons on those memorable quotes that 1This extraction involved some edit-distance-based alignment, since the exact form of the line in the script can exhibit minor differences from the version typed into IMDb. rmotuqsfebmaNerolbm543281760 0 1234D5ecil678910 894 Figure 1: Location of memorable quotes in each decile of movie scripts (the first 10th, the second 10th, etc.), summed over all movies. The same qualitative results hold if we discard each movie’s very first and last line, which might have privileged status. appear as a single sentence rather than a multi-line block.2 We now formulate a task that we can use to evaluate the features of memorable quotes. Recall that our goal is to identify effects based in the language of the quotes themselves, beyond any factors arising from the speaker or context. Thus, for each (singlesentence) memorable quote M, we identify a nonmemorable quote that is as similar as possible to M in all characteristics but the choice of words. This means we want it to be spoken by the same character in the same movie. It also means that we want it to have the same length: controlling for length is important because we expect that on average, shorter quotes will be easier to remember than long quotes, and that wouldn’t be an interesting textual effect to report. Moreover, we also want to control for the fact that a quote’s position in a movie can affect memorability: certain scenes produce more memorable dialogue, and as Figure 1 demonstrates, in aggregate memorable quotes also occur disproportionately near the beginnings and especially the ends of movies. In summary, then, for each M, we pick a contrasting (single-sentence) quote N from the same movie that is as close in the script as possible to M (either before or after it), subject to the conditions that (i) M and N are uttered by the same speaker, (ii) M and N have the same number of words, and (iii) N does not occur in the IMDb list of memorable 2We also ran experiments relaxing the single-sentence assumption, which allows for stricter scene control and a larger dataset but complicates comparisons involving syntax. The non-syntax results were in line with those reported here.

(Contractions character, have the same length, and one is labeled memorable by the IMDb such as “it’s” count as two words.) quotes for the movie (either as a single line or as part of a larger block). Given such pairs, we formulate a pairwise comparison task: given M and N, determine which is the memorable quote. Psychological research on subjective evaluation [35], as well as initial experiments using ourselves as subjects, indicated that this pairwise set-up easier to work with than simply presenting a single sentence and asking whether it is memorable or not; the latter requires agreement on an “absolute” criterion for memorability that is very hard to impose consistently, whereas the former simply requires a judgment that one quote is more memorable than another. Our main dataset, available at http://www.cs. cornell.edu/∼cristian/memorability.html,3 thus consists of approximately 2200 such (M, N) pairs, separated by a median of 5 same-character lines in the script. The reader can get a sense for the nature of the data from the three examples in Table 1. We now discuss two further aspects to the formulation of the experiment: a preliminary pilot study involving human subjects, and the incorporation of search engine counts into the data. 2.2 Pilot study: Human performance As a preliminary consideration, we did a small pilot study to see if humans can distinguish memorable from non-memorable quotes, assuming our IMDBinduced labels as gold standard. Six subjects, all native speakers of English and none an author of this paper, were presented with 11 or 12 pairs of memorable vs. non-memorable quotes; again, we controlled for extra-textual effects by ensuring that in each pair the two quotes come from the same movie, are by the same character, have the same length, and 3Also available there: other examples and factoids. 895 Table 2: Human pilot study: number of matches to IMDb-induced annotation, ordered by decreasing match percentage. For the null hypothesis of random guessing, these results are statistically significant, p < 2−6 ≈ .016. appear as nearly as possible in the same scene.4 The order of quotes within pairs was randomized. Importantly, because we wanted to understand whether the language of the quotes by itself contains signals about memorability, we chose quotes from movies that the subjects said they had not seen. (This means that each subject saw a different set of quotes.) Moreover, the subjects were requested not to consult any external sources of information.5 The reader is welcome to try a demo version of the task at http: //www.cs.cornell.edu/∼cristian/memorability.html. Table 2 shows that all the subjects performed (sometimes much) better than chance, and against the null hypothesis that all subjects are guessing randomly, the results are statistically significant, p < 2−6 ≈ .016.

Given the “production” aspect of memorability discussed in § 1, we stihoonu”ld a saplesoc expect tmhaotr mabeimlityora dbislce quotes nw §il1l ,te wnde to appear more extensively on Web pages than nonmemorable quotes; note that incorporating this insight makes it possible to use the (implicit) judgments of a much larger number of people than are represented by the IMDb database. It therefore makes sense to try using search-engine result counts as a second indication of memorability. We experimented with several ways of constructing memorability information from search-engine counts, but this proved challenging. Searching for a quote as a stand-alone phrase runs into the problem that a number of quotes are also sentences that people use without the movie in mind, and so high counts for such quotes do not testify to the phrase’s status as a memorable quote from the movie. On the other hand, searching for the quote in a Boolean conjunction with the movie’s title discards most of these uses, but also eliminates a large fraction of the appearances on the Web that we want to find: precisely because memorable quotes tend to have widespread cultural usage, people generally don’t feel the need to include the movie’s title when invoking them. Finally, since we are dealing with roughly 1000 movies, the result counts vary over an enormous range, from recent blockbusters to movies with relatively small fan bases. In the end, we found that it was more effective to use the result counts in conjunction with the IMDb labels, so that the counts played the role of an additional filter rather than a free-standing numerical value. Thus, for each pair (M, N) produced using the IMDb methodology above, we searched for each of M and N as quoted expressions in a Boolean conjunction with the title of the movie. We then kept only those pairs for which M (i) produced more than five results in our (quoted, conjoined) search, and (ii) produced at least twice as many results as the cor6The average accuracy being below 100% reinforces that context is very important, too. 896 responding search for N. We created a version of this filtered dataset using each of Google and Bing, and all the main findings were consistent with the results on the IMDb-only dataset. Thus, in what follows, we will focus on the main IMDb-only dataset, discussing the relationship to the dataset filtered by search engine counts where relevant (in which case we will refer to the +Google dataset). 3 Never send a human to do a machine’s job. We now discuss experiments that investigate the hypotheses discussed in §1. In particular, we devise pmoetthheosdess t dhiastc can assess 1th.e Idnis ptianrcttiicvuelnaer,ss w aend d generality hypotheses and test whether there exists a notion of “memorable language” that operates across domains. In addition, we evaluate and compare the predictive power of these hypotheses. 3.1 Distinctiveness One of the hypotheses we examine is whether the use of language in memorable quotes is to some extent unusual. In order to quantify the level of distinctiveness of a quote, we take a language-model approach: we model “common language” using the newswire sections of the Brown corpus [21]7, and evaluate how distinctive a quote is by evaluating its likelihood with respect to this model the lower the likelihood, the more distinctive. In order to assess different levels of lexical and syntactic distinctiveness, we employ a total of six Laplacesmoothed8 language models: 1-gram, 2-gram, and — 3-gram word LMs and 1-gram, 2-gram and 3-gram LMs. We find strong evidence that from a lexical perspective, memorable quotes are more distinctive than their non-memorable counterparts. As indicated in Table 3, for each of our lexical “common language” models, in about 60% of the quote pairs, the memorable quote is more distinctive. Interestingly, the reverse is true when it comes to part-of-speech9 7Results were qualitatively similar if we used the fiction portions. The age of the Brown corpus makes it less likely to contain modern movie quotes. 8We employ Laplace (additive) smoothing with a smoothing parameter of 0.2. The language models’ vocabulary was that of the entire training corpus. 9Throughout we obtain part-of-speech tags by using the NLTK maximum entropy tagger with default parameters. in which the the memorable quote is more distinctive than the non-memorable one according to the respective “common language” model. Significance according to a two-tailed sign test is indicated using *-notation (∗∗∗=“p<.001”). syntax: memorable quotes appear to follow the syntactic patterns of “common language” as closely as or more closely than non-memorable quotes. Together, these results suggest that memorable quotes consist of unusual word sequences built on common syntactic scaffolding. 3.2 Generality Another of our hypotheses is that memorable quotes are easier to use outside the specific context in which they were uttered that is, more “portable” and therefore exhibit fewer terms that refer to those settings. We use the following syntactic properties as proxies for the generality of a quote: • Fewer 3rd-person pronouns, since these commonly r 3efer to a person or object that was introduced earlier in the discourse. Utterances that employ fewer such pronouns are easier to adapt to new contexts, and so will be considered more — — general. • More indefinite articles like a and an, since they are more likely ttioc lreesfer li ktoe general concepts than definite articles. Quotes with more indefinite articles will be considered more general. Fewer past tense verbs and more present tFeenwsee verbs, tseinncsee t vheer bfosrm aenrd are more likely to refer to specific previous events. Therefore utterances that employ fewer past tense verbs (and more present tense verbs) will be considered more general. Table 4 gives the results for each of these four metrics in each case, we show the percentage of • — 897 TalfmGebowsnre4pa:in3srGldet sypfne.msrate.lripnctysoe: purncsetaI56gM47e.326D9o710bf% -qo∗u n∗l tyepa+56iG892rs.o7i364ng% wl∗ eh∗i ch the memorable quote is more general than the non- memorable ones according to the respective metric. Pairs where the metric does not distinguish between the quotes are not considered. quote pairs for which the memorable quote scores better on the generality metric. Note that because the issue of generality is a complex one for which there is no straightforward single metric, our approach here is based on several proxies for generality, considered independently; yet, as the results show, all of these point in a consistent direction. It is an interesting open question to develop richer ways of assessing whether a quote has greater generality, in the sense that people intuitively attribute to memorable quotes. 3.3 “Memorable” language beyond movies One of the motivating questions in our analysis is whether there are general principles underlying “memorable language.” The results thus far suggest potential families of such principles. A further question in this direction is whether the notion of memorability can be extended across different domains, and for this we collected (and distribute on our website) 431 phrases that were explicitly designed to be memorable: advertising slogans (e.g., “Quality never goes out of style.”). The focus on slogans is also in keeping with one of the initial motivations in studying memorability, namely, marketing applications in other words, assessing whether a proposed slogan has features that are consistent with memorable text. The fact that it’s not clear how to construct a collection of “non-memorable” counterparts to slogans appears to pose a technical challenge. However, we can still use a language-modeling approach to assess whether the textual properties of the slogans are closer to the memorable movie quotes (as one would conjecture) or to the non-memorable movie quotes. Specifically, we train one language model on memorable quotes and another on non-memorable quotes — guage: percentage of slogans that have higher likelihood under the memorable language model than under the nonmemorable one (for each of the six language models considered). Rightmost column: for reference, the percentage of newswire sentences that have higher likelihood under the memorable language model than under the nonmemorable one.

(%s of 3rd pers. pronouns and indefinite articles are relative to all tokens, %s of past tense are relative to all past and present verbs.) and compare how likely each slogan is to be produced according to these two models. As shown in the middle column of Table 5, we find that slogans are better predicted both lexically and syntactically by the former model. This result thus offers evidence for a concept of “memorable language” that can be applied beyond a single domain. We also note that the higher likelihood of slogans under a “memorable language” model is not simply occurring for the trivial reason that this model predicts all other large bodies of text better. In particular, the newswire section of the Brown corpus is predicted better at the lexical level by the language model trained on non-memorable quotes. Finally, Table 6 shows that slogans employ general language, in the sense that for each of our generality metrics, we see a slogans/memorablequotes/non-memorable quotes spectrum. 3.4 Prediction task We now show how the principles discussed above can provide features for a basic prediction task, corresponding to the task in our human pilot study: 898 given a pair of quotes, identify the memorable one. Our first formulation of the prediction task uses a standard bag-of-words model10. If there were no information in the textual content of a quote to determine whether it were memorable, then an SVM employing bag-of-words features should perform no better than chance. Instead, though, it obtains 59.67% (10-fold cross-validation) accuracy, as shown in Table 7. We then develop models using features based on the measures formulated earlier in this section: generality measures (the four listed in Table 4); distinctiveness measures (likelihood according to 1, 2, and 3-gram “common language” models at the lexical and part-of-speech level for each quote in the pair, their differences, and pairwise comparisons between them); and similarityto-slogans measures (likelihood according to 1, 2, and 3-gram slogan-language models at the lexical and part-of-speech level for each quote in the pair, their differences, and pairwise comparisons between them). Even a relatively small number of distinctiveness features, on their own, improve significantly over the much larger bag-of-words model. When we include additional features based on generality and language-model features measuring similarity to slogans, the performance improves further (last line of Table 7). Thus, the main conclusion from these prediction tasks is that abstracting notions such as distinctiveness and generality can produce relatively streamlined models that outperform much heavier-weight bag-of-words models, and can suggest steps toward approaching the performance of human judges who very much unlike our system have the full cultural context in which movies occur at their disposal. — — 3.5 Other characteristics We also made some auxiliary observations that may be ofinterest. Specifically, we find differences in letter and sound distribution (e.g., memorable quotes after curse-word removal use significantly more “front sounds” (labials or front vowels such as represented by the letter i) and significantly fewer “back sounds” such as the one represented by u),11 — — 10We discarded terms appearing fewer than 10 times. 11These findings may relate to marketing research on sound symbolism [7, 19, 40].

Accuracies statistically significantly greater than bag-of-words according to a two-tailed t-test are indicated with *(p<.05) and **(p<.01). word complexity (e.g., memorable quotes use words with significantly more syllables) and phrase complexity (e.g., memorable quotes use fewer coordinating conjunctions). The latter two are in line with our distinctiveness hypothesis. 4 A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away How an item’s linguistic form affects the reaction it generates has been studied in several contexts, including evaluations of product reviews [9], political speeches [12], on-line posts [13], scientific papers [14], and retweeting of Twitter posts [36]. We use a different set of features, abstracting the notions of distinctiveness and generality, in order to focus on these higher-level aspects of phrasing rather than on particular lower-level features. Related to our interest in distinctiveness, work in advertising research has studied the effect of syntactic complexity on recognition and recall of slogans [5, 6, 24]. There may also be connections to Von Restorff’s isolation effect Hunt [17], which asserts that when all but one item in a list are similar in some way, memory for the different item is enhanced. Related to our interest in generality, Knapp et al. [20] surveyed subjects regarding memorable messages or pieces of advice they had received, finding that the ability to be applied to multiple concrete situations was an important factor. Memorability, although distinct from “memorizability”, relates to short- and long-term recall. Thorn and Page [34] survey sub-lexical, lexical, and semantic attributes affecting short-term memorability of lexical items. Studies of verbatim recall have also considered the task of distinguishing an exact quote from close paraphrases [3]. Investigations of longterm recall have included studies ofculturally signif- 899 icant passages of text [29] and findings regarding the effect of rhetorical devices of alliterative [4], “rhythmic, poetic, and thematic constraints” [18, 26]. Finally, there are complex connections between humor and memory [32], which may lead to interactions with computational humor recognition [25]. 5 I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Motivated by the broad question of what kinds of information achieve widespread public awareness, we studied the the effect of phrasing on a quote’s memorability. A challenge is that quotes differ not only in how they are worded, but also in who said them and under what circumstances; to deal with this difficulty, we constructed a controlled corpus of movie quotes in which lines deemed memorable are paired with non-memorable lines spoken by the same character at approximately the same point in the same movie. After controlling for context and situation, memorable quotes were still found to exhibit, on av- erage (there will always be individual exceptions), significant differences from non-memorable quotes in several important respects, including measures capturing distinctiveness and generality. Our experiments with slogans show how the principles we identify can extend to a different domain. Future work may lead to applications in marketing, advertising and education [4]. Moreover, the subtle nature of memorability, and its connection to research in psychology, suggests a range of further research directions. We believe that the framework developed here can serve as the basis for further computational studies of the process by which information takes hold in the public consciousness, and the role that language effects play in this process.

<p>Author: Graham Neubig ; Taro Watanabe ; Shinsuke Mori ; Tatsuya Kawahara</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that accurate machine translation is possible without the concept of “words,” treating MT as a problem of transformation between character strings. We achieve this result by applying phrasal inversion transduction grammar alignment techniques to character strings to train a character-based translation model, and using this in the phrase-based MT framework. We also propose a look-ahead parsing algorithm and substring-informed prior probabilities to achieve more effective and efficient alignment. In an evaluation, we demonstrate that character-based translation can achieve results that compare to word-based systems while effectively translating unknown and uncommon words over several language pairs.</p><p>5 0.061576217 <a title="197-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-A_Class-Based_Agreement_Model_for_Generating_Accurately_Inflected_Translations.html">3 acl-2012-A Class-Based Agreement Model for Generating Accurately Inflected Translations</a></p>
<p>Author: Spence Green ; John DeNero</p><p>Abstract: When automatically translating from a weakly inflected source language like English to a target language with richer grammatical features such as gender and dual number, the output commonly contains morpho-syntactic agreement errors. To address this issue, we present a target-side, class-based agreement model. Agreement is promoted by scoring a sequence of fine-grained morpho-syntactic classes that are predicted during decoding for each translation hypothesis. For English-to-Arabic translation, our model yields a +1.04 BLEU average improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline. The model does not require bitext or phrase table annotations and can be easily implemented as a feature in many phrase-based decoders. 1</p><p>6 0.058073856 <a title="197-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Fast_and_Robust_Part-of-Speech_Tagging_Using_Dynamic_Model_Selection.html">96 acl-2012-Fast and Robust Part-of-Speech Tagging Using Dynamic Model Selection</a></p>

<p>Author: Rebecca Dridan ; Stephan Oepen</p><p>Abstract: We examine some of the frequently disregarded subtleties of tokenization in Penn Treebank style, and present a new rule-based preprocessing toolkit that not only reproduces the Treebank tokenization with unmatched accuracy, but also maintains exact stand-off pointers to the original text and allows flexible configuration to diverse use cases (e.g. to genreor domain-specific idiosyncrasies). 1 Introduction—Motivation The task of tokenization is hardly counted among the grand challenges of NLP and is conventionally interpreted as breaking up “natural language text [...] into distinct meaningful units (or tokens)” (Kaplan, 2005). Practically speaking, however, tokenization is often combined with other string-level preprocessing—for example normalization of punctuation (of different conventions for dashes, say), disambiguation of quotation marks (into opening vs. closing quotes), or removal of unwanted mark-up— where the specifics of such pre-processing depend both on properties of the input text as well as on assumptions made in downstream processing. Applying some string-level normalizationprior to the identification of token boundaries can improve (or simplify) tokenization, and a sub-task like the disambiguation of quote marks would in fact be hard to perform after tokenization, seeing that it depends on adjacency to whitespace. In the following, we thus assume a generalized notion of tokenization, comprising all string-level processing up to and including the conversion of a sequence of characters (a string) to a sequence of token objects.1 1Obviously, some of the normalization we include in the tokenization task (in this generalized interpretation) could be left to downstream analysis, where a tagger or parser, for example, could be expected to accept non-disambiguated quote marks (so-called straight or typewriter quotes) and disambiguate as 378 Arguably, even in an overtly ‘separating’ language like English, there can be token-level ambiguities that ultimately can only be resolved through parsing (see § 3 for candidate examples), and indeed Waldron et al. (2006) entertain the idea of downstream processing on a token lattice. In this article, however, we accept the tokenization conventions and sequential nature of the Penn Treebank (PTB; Marcus et al., 1993) as a useful point of reference— primarily for interoperability of different NLP tools. Still, we argue, there is remaining work to be done on PTB-compliant tokenization (reviewed in§ 2), both methodologically, practically, and technologically. In § 3 we observe that state-of-the-art tools perform poorly on re-creating PTB tokenization, and move on in § 4 to develop a modular, parameterizable, and transparent framework for tokenization. Besides improvements in tokenization accuracy and adaptability to diverse use cases, in § 5 we further argue that each token object should unambiguously link back to an underlying element of the original input, which in the case of tokenization of text we realize through a notion of characterization. 2 Common Conventions Due to the popularity of the PTB, its tokenization has been a de-facto standard for two decades. Ap- proximately, this means splitting off punctuation into separate tokens, disambiguating straight quotes, and separating contractions such as can’t into ca and n ’t. There are, however, many special cases— part of syntactic analysis. However, on the (predominant) point of view that punctuation marks form tokens in their own right, the tokenizer would then have to adorn quote marks in some way, as to whether they were split off the left or right periphery of a larger token, to avoid unwanted syntactic ambiguity. Further, increasing use of Unicode makes texts containing ‘natively’ disambiguated quotes more common, where it would seem unfortunate to discard linguistically pertinent information by normalizing towards the poverty of pure ASCII punctuation.

In much tagging and parsing work, PTB data has been used with gold-standard tokens, to a point where many researchers are unaware of the existence of the original ‘raw’ (untokenized) text. Accordingly, the formal definition of PTB has received little attention, but reproducing PTB tokenization automatically actually is not a trivial task (see § 3). As the NLP community has moved to process data other than the PTB, some of the limitations of the tokenization2 PTB tokenization have been recognized, and many recently released data sets are accompanied by a note on tokenization along the lines of: Tokenization is similar to that used in PTB, except . . . Most exceptions are to do with hyphenation, or special forms of named entities such as chemical names or URLs. None of the documentation with extant data sets is sufficient to fully reproduce the tokenization.3 The CoNLL 2008 Shared Task data actually provided two forms of tokenization: that from the PTB (which many pre-processing tools would have been trained on), and another form that splits (most) hyphenated terms. This latter convention recently seems to be gaining ground in data sets like the Google 1T n-gram corpus (LDC #2006T13) and OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006). Clearly, as one moves towards a more application- and domaindriven idea of ‘correct’ tokenization, a more transparent, flexible, and adaptable approach to stringlevel pre-processing is called for. 3 A Contrastive Experiment To get an overview of current tokenization methods, we recovered and tokenized the raw text which was the source of the (Wall Street Journal portion of the) PTB, and compared it to the gold tokenization in the syntactic annotation in the We used three common methods of tokenization: (a) the original treebank.4 2See http : / /www . cis .upenn .edu/ ~t reebank/ t okeni z at ion .html for available ‘documentation’ and a sed script for PTB-style tokenization. 3Øvrelid et al. (2010) observe that tokenizing with the GENIA tagger yields mismatches in one of five sentences of the GENIA Treebank, although the GENIA guidelines refer to scripts that may be available on request (Tateisi & Tsujii, 2006). 4The original WSJ text was last included with the 1995 release of the PTB (LDC #95T07) and required alignment with the treebank, with some manual correction so that the same text is represented in both raw and parsed formats. 379 Tokenization Differing Levenshtein Method Sentences Distance tokenizer.sed 3264 11168 CoreNLP 1781 3717 C&J; parser 2597 4516 Table 1: Quantitative view on tokenization differences. PTB tokenizer.sed script; (b) the tokenizer from the Stanford CoreNLP tools5; and (c) tokenization from the parser of Charniak & Johnson (2005). Table 1 shows quantitative differences between each of the three methods and the PTB, both in terms of the number of sentences where the tokenization differs, and also in the total Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein, 1966) over tokens (for a total of 49,208 sentences and 1,173,750 gold-standard tokens). Looking at the differences qualitatively, the most consistent issue across all tokenization methods was ambiguity of sentence-final periods. In the treebank, final periods are always (with about 10 exceptions) a separate token. If the sentence ends in U.S. (but not other abbreviations, oddly), an extra period is hallucinated, so the abbreviation also has one. In contrast, C&J; add a period to all final abbreviations, CoreNLP groups the final period with a final abbreviation and hence lacks a sentence-final period token, and the sed script strips the period off U.S. The ‘correct’ choice in this case is not obvious and will depend on how the tokens are to be used. The majority of the discrepancies in the sed script tokenization come from an under-restricted punctuation rule that incorrectly splits on commas within numbers or ampersands within names. Other than that, the problematic cases are mostly shared across tokenization methods, and include issues with currencies, Irish names, hyphenization, and quote disambiguation. In addition, C&J; make some additional modifications to the text, lemmatising expressions such as won ’t as will and n ’t. 4 REPP: A Generalized Framework For tokenization to be studied as a first-class problem, and to enable customization and flexibility to diverse use cases, we suggest a non-procedural, rule-based framework dubbed REPP (Regular 5See corenlp / / nlp . st anford . edu / so ftware / run in ‘ st rict Treebank3 ’ mode. http : . shtml, Expression-Based Pre-Processing)—essentially a cascade of ordered finite-state string rewriting rules, though transcending the formal complexity of regular languages by inclusion of (a) full perl-compatible regular expressions and (b) fixpoint iteration over groups of rules. In this approach, a first phase of string-level substitutions inserts whitespace around, for example, punctuation marks; upon completion of string rewriting, token boundaries are stipulated between all whitespace-separated substrings (and only these). For a good balance of human and machine readability, REPP tokenization rules are specified in a simple, line-oriented textual form. Figure 1 shows a (simplified) excerpt from our PTB-style tokenizer, where the first character on each line is one of four REPP operators, as follows: (a) ‘#’ for group formation; (b) ‘>’ for group invocation, (c) ‘ ! ’ for substitution (allowing capture groups), and (d) ‘ : ’ for token boundary detection.6 In Figure 1, the two rules stripping off prefix and suffix punctuation marks adjacent to whitespace (i.e. matching the tab-separated left-hand side of the rule, to replace the match with its right-hand side) form a numbered group (‘# 1’), which will be iterated when called (‘> 1 until none ’) of the rules in the group fires (a fixpoint). In this example, conditioning on whitespace adjacency avoids the issues observed with the PTB sed script (e.g. token boundaries within comma-separated numbers) and also protects against infinite loops in the group.7 REPP rule sets can be organized as modules, typ6Strictly speaking, there are another two operators, for lineoriented comments and automated versioning of rule files. 7For this example, the same effects seemingly could be obtained without iteration (using greatly more complex rules); our actual, non-simplified rules, however, further deal with punctuation marks that can function as prefixes or suffixes, as well as with corner cases like factor(s) or Ca[2+]. Also in mark-up removal and normalization, we have found it necessary to ‘parse’ nested structures by means of iterative groups. 380 ically each in a file of its own, and invoked selectively by name (e.g. ‘>wiki’ in Figure 1); to date, there exist modules for quote disambiguation, (relevant subsets of) various mark-up languages (HTML, LATEX, wiki, and XML), and a handful of robustness rules (e.g. seeking to identify and repair ‘sandwiched’ inter-token punctuation). Individual tokenizers are configured at run-time, by selectively activating a set of modules (through command-line op- tions). An open-source reference implementation of the REPP framework (in C++) is available, together with a library of modules for English. 5 Characterization for Traceability Tokenization, and specifically our notion of generalized tokenization which allows text normalization, involves changes to the original text being analyzed, rather than just additional annotation. As such, full traceability from the token objects to the original text is required, which we formalize as ‘characterization’, in terms of character position links back to the source.8 This has the practical benefit of allowing downstream analysis as direct (stand-off) annotation on the source text, as seen for example in the ACL Anthology Searchbench (Schäfer et al., 2011). With our general regular expression replacement rules in REPP, making precise what it means for a token to link back to its ‘underlying’ substring requires some care in the design and implementation. Definite characterization links between the string before (I) and after (O) the application of a single orurele ( can only bftee res (tOab)li tshheed a pinp lcicerattiaoinn positions, viz.

Each character in the string being processed has a start and end position, marking the point before and after the character in the original string. Before processing, the end position would always be one greater than the start position. However, if a rule mapped a string-initial, PTB-style opening double quote (``) to one-character Unicode “, the new first character of the string would have start position 0, but end position 2. In contrast, if there were a rule !wo (n’ t ) will \1 (1) applied to the string I ’t go!, all characters in the won second token of the resulting string (I will n’t go!) will have start position 2 and end position 4.

When repeating the experiment of § 3 above using REPP tokenization, we obtained an initial difference in 1505 sentences, with a Levenshtein dis10This subtlety will actually be invisible in the final token objects if will remains a single token, but if subsequent rules were to split this token further, all its output tokens would have a start position of 2 and an end position of 4. While this example may seem unlikely, we have come across similar scenarios in fine-tuning actual REPP rules. 381 tance of 3543 (broadly comparable to CoreNLP, if marginally more accurate). Examining these discrepancies, we revealed some deficiencies in our rules, as well as some peculiarities of the ‘raw’ Wall Street Journal text from the PTB distribution. A little more than 200 mismatches were owed to improper treatment of currency symbols (AU$) and decade abbreviations (’60s), which led to the refinement of two existing rules. Notable PTB idiosyncrasies (in the sense of deviations from common typography) include ellipses with spaces separating the periods and a fairly large number of possessives (’s) being separated from their preceding token. Other aspects of gold-standard PTB tokenization we consider unwarranted ‘damage’ to the input text, such as hallucinating an extra period after U . S . and splitting cannot (which adds spurious ambiguity). For use cases where the goal were strict compliance, for instance in pre-processing inputs for a PTB-derived parser, we added an optional REPP module (of currently half a dozen rules) to cater to these corner cases—in a spirit similar to the CoreNLP mode we used in § 3. With these extra rules, remaining tokenization discrepancies are contained in 603 sentences (just over 1%), which gives a Levenshtein distance of 1389. 7 Discussion—Conclusion Compared to the best-performing off-the-shelf system in our earlier experiment (where it is reasonable to assume that PTB data has played at least some role in development), our results eliminate two thirds of the remaining tokenization errors—a more substantial reduction than recent improvements in parsing accuracy against the PTB, for example.

<p>Author: Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil ; Justin Cheng ; Jon Kleinberg ; Lillian Lee</p><p>Abstract: Understanding the ways in which information achieves widespread public awareness is a research question of significant interest. We consider whether, and how, the way in which the information is phrased the choice of words and sentence structure — can affect this process. To this end, we develop an analysis framework and build a corpus of movie quotes, annotated with memorability information, in which we are able to control for both the speaker and the setting of the quotes. We find that there are significant differences between memorable and non-memorable quotes in several key dimensions, even after controlling for situational and contextual factors. One is lexical distinctiveness: in aggregate, memorable quotes use less common word choices, but at the same time are built upon a scaffolding of common syntactic patterns. Another is that memorable quotes tend to be more general in ways that make them easy to apply in new contexts — that is, more portable. — We also show how the concept of “memorable language” can be extended across domains. 1 Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. Understanding what items will be retained in the public consciousness, and why, is a question of fundamental interest in many domains, including marketing, politics, entertainment, and social media; as we all know, many items barely register, whereas others catch on and take hold in many people’s minds. An active line of recent computational work has employed a variety of perspectives on this question. 892 Building on a foundation in the sociology of diffusion [27, 31], researchers have explored the ways in which network structure affects the way information spreads, with domains of interest including blogs [1, 11], email [37], on-line commerce [22], and social media [2, 28, 33, 38]. There has also been recent research addressing temporal aspects of how different media sources convey information [23, 30, 39] and ways in which people react differently to infor- mation on different topics [28, 36]. Beyond all these factors, however, one’s everyday experience with these domains suggests that the way in which a piece of information is expressed the choice of words, the way it is phrased might also have a fundamental effect on the extent to which it takes hold in people’s minds. Concepts that attain wide reach are often carried in messages such as political slogans, marketing phrases, or aphorisms whose language seems intuitively to be memorable, “catchy,” or otherwise compelling. Our first challenge in exploring this hypothesis is to develop a notion of “successful” language that is precise enough to allow for quantitative evaluation. We also face the challenge of devising an evaluation setting that separates the phrasing of a message from the conditions in which it was delivered highlycited quotes tend to have been delivered under compelling circumstances or fit an existing cultural, political, or social narrative, and potentially what appeals to us about the quote is really just its invocation of these extra-linguistic contexts. Is the form of the language adding an effect beyond or independent of these (obviously very crucial) factors? To — — — investigate the question, one needs a way of controlProce dJienjgus, R ofep thueb 5lic0t hof A Knonruea ,l M 8-e1e4ti Jnugly o f2 t0h1e2 A.s ?c so2c0ia1t2io Ans fso rc Ciatoiomnp fuotart Cio nmaplu Ltiantgiounisatlic Lsi,n pgaugiestsi8c 9s2–901, ling as much as possible for the role that the surrounding context of the language plays. — — The present work (i): Evaluating language-based memorability Defining what makes an utterance memorable is subtle, and scholars in several domains have written about this question. There is a rough consensus that an appropriate definition involves elements of both recognition people should be able to retain the quote and recognize it when they hear it invoked and production people should be motivated to refer to it in relevant situations [15]. One suggested reason for why some memes succeed is their ability to provoke emotions [16]. Alternatively, memorable quotes can be good for expressing the feelings, mood, or situation of an individual, a group, or a culture (the zeitgeist): “Certain quotes exquisitely capture the mood or feeling we wish to communicate to someone. We hear them ... and store them away for future use” [10]. None of these observations, however, serve as definitions, and indeed, we believe it desirable to — — — not pre-commit to an abstract definition, but rather to adopt an operational formulation based on external human judgments. In designing our study, we focus on a domain in which (i) there is rich use of language, some of which has achieved deep cultural penetration; (ii) there already exist a large number of external human judgments perhaps implicit, but in a form we can extract; and (iii) we can control for the setting in which the text was used. Specifically, we use the complete scripts of roughly 1000 movies, representing diverse genres, eras, and levels of popularity, and consider which lines are the most “memorable”. To acquire memorability labels, for each sentence in each script, we determine whether it has been listed as a “memorable quote” by users of the widely-known IMDb (the Internet Movie Database), and also estimate the number oftimes it appears on the Web. Both ofthese serve as memorability metrics for our purposes. When we evaluate properties of memorable quotes, we comparethemwithquotes thatarenotassessed as memorable, but were spoken by the same character, at approximately the same point in the same movie. This enables us to control in a fairly — fine-grained way for the confounding effects of context discussed above: we can observe differences 893 that persist even after taking into account both the speaker and the setting. In a pilot validation study, we find that human subjects are effective at recognizing the more IMDbmemorable of two quotes, even for movies they have not seen. This motivates a search for features intrinsic to the text of quotes that signal memorability. In fact, comments provided by the human subjects as part of the task suggested two basic forms that such textual signals could take: subjects felt that (i) memorable quotes often involve a distinctive turn of phrase; and (ii) memorable quotes tend to invoke general themes that aren’t tied to the specific setting they came from, and hence can be more easily invoked for future (out of context) uses. We test both of these principles in our analysis of the data. The present work (ii): What distinguishes memorable quotes Under the controlled-comparison setting sketched above, we find that memorable quotes exhibit significant differences from nonmemorable quotes in several fundamental respects, and these differences in the data reinforce the two main principles from the human pilot study. First, we show a concrete sense in which memorable quotes are indeed distinctive: with respect to lexical language models trained on the newswire portions of the Brown corpus [21], memorable quotes have significantly lower likelihood than their nonmemorable counterparts. Interestingly, this distinctiveness takes place at the level of words, but not at the level of other syntactic features: the part-ofspeech composition of memorable quotes is in fact more likely with respect to newswire. Thus, we can think of memorable quotes as consisting, in an aggregate sense, of unusual word choices built on a scaffolding of common part-of-speech patterns. We also identify a number of ways in which memorable quotes convey greater generality. In their patterns of verb tenses, personal pronouns, and determiners, memorable quotes are structured so as to be more “free-standing,” containing fewer markers that indicate references to nearby text. Memorable quotes differ in other interesting as- pects as well, such as sound distributions. Our analysis ofmemorable movie quotes suggests a framework by which the memorability of text in a range of different domains could be investigated. We provide evidence that such cross-domain properties may hold, guided by one of our motivating applications in marketing. In particular, we analyze a corpus of advertising slogans, and we show that these slogans have significantly greater likelihood at both the word level and the part-of-speech level with respect to a language model trained on memorable movie quotes, compared to a corresponding language model trained on non-memorable movie quotes. This suggests that some of the principles underlying memorable text have the potential to apply across different areas.

Following [8], we constructed a corpus consisting of all lines from roughly 1000 movies, varying in genre, era, and popularity; for each movie, we then extracted the list of quotes from IMDb’s Memorable Quotes page corresponding to the movie.1 A memorable quote in IMDb can appear either as an individual sentence spoken by one character, or as a multi-sentence line, or as a block of dialogue involving multiple characters. In the latter two cases, it can be hard to determine which particular portion is viewed as memorable (some involve a build-up to a punch line; others involve the follow-through after a well-phrased opening sentence), and so we focus in our comparisons on those memorable quotes that 1This extraction involved some edit-distance-based alignment, since the exact form of the line in the script can exhibit minor differences from the version typed into IMDb. rmotuqsfebmaNerolbm543281760 0 1234D5ecil678910 894 Figure 1: Location of memorable quotes in each decile of movie scripts (the first 10th, the second 10th, etc.), summed over all movies. The same qualitative results hold if we discard each movie’s very first and last line, which might have privileged status. appear as a single sentence rather than a multi-line block.2 We now formulate a task that we can use to evaluate the features of memorable quotes. Recall that our goal is to identify effects based in the language of the quotes themselves, beyond any factors arising from the speaker or context. Thus, for each (singlesentence) memorable quote M, we identify a nonmemorable quote that is as similar as possible to M in all characteristics but the choice of words. This means we want it to be spoken by the same character in the same movie. It also means that we want it to have the same length: controlling for length is important because we expect that on average, shorter quotes will be easier to remember than long quotes, and that wouldn’t be an interesting textual effect to report. Moreover, we also want to control for the fact that a quote’s position in a movie can affect memorability: certain scenes produce more memorable dialogue, and as Figure 1 demonstrates, in aggregate memorable quotes also occur disproportionately near the beginnings and especially the ends of movies. In summary, then, for each M, we pick a contrasting (single-sentence) quote N from the same movie that is as close in the script as possible to M (either before or after it), subject to the conditions that (i) M and N are uttered by the same speaker, (ii) M and N have the same number of words, and (iii) N does not occur in the IMDb list of memorable 2We also ran experiments relaxing the single-sentence assumption, which allows for stricter scene control and a larger dataset but complicates comparisons involving syntax. The non-syntax results were in line with those reported here.

(Contractions character, have the same length, and one is labeled memorable by the IMDb such as “it’s” count as two words.) quotes for the movie (either as a single line or as part of a larger block). Given such pairs, we formulate a pairwise comparison task: given M and N, determine which is the memorable quote. Psychological research on subjective evaluation [35], as well as initial experiments using ourselves as subjects, indicated that this pairwise set-up easier to work with than simply presenting a single sentence and asking whether it is memorable or not; the latter requires agreement on an “absolute” criterion for memorability that is very hard to impose consistently, whereas the former simply requires a judgment that one quote is more memorable than another. Our main dataset, available at http://www.cs. cornell.edu/∼cristian/memorability.html,3 thus consists of approximately 2200 such (M, N) pairs, separated by a median of 5 same-character lines in the script. The reader can get a sense for the nature of the data from the three examples in Table 1. We now discuss two further aspects to the formulation of the experiment: a preliminary pilot study involving human subjects, and the incorporation of search engine counts into the data. 2.2 Pilot study: Human performance As a preliminary consideration, we did a small pilot study to see if humans can distinguish memorable from non-memorable quotes, assuming our IMDBinduced labels as gold standard. Six subjects, all native speakers of English and none an author of this paper, were presented with 11 or 12 pairs of memorable vs. non-memorable quotes; again, we controlled for extra-textual effects by ensuring that in each pair the two quotes come from the same movie, are by the same character, have the same length, and 3Also available there: other examples and factoids. 895 Table 2: Human pilot study: number of matches to IMDb-induced annotation, ordered by decreasing match percentage. For the null hypothesis of random guessing, these results are statistically significant, p < 2−6 ≈ .016. appear as nearly as possible in the same scene.4 The order of quotes within pairs was randomized. Importantly, because we wanted to understand whether the language of the quotes by itself contains signals about memorability, we chose quotes from movies that the subjects said they had not seen. (This means that each subject saw a different set of quotes.) Moreover, the subjects were requested not to consult any external sources of information.5 The reader is welcome to try a demo version of the task at http: //www.cs.cornell.edu/∼cristian/memorability.html. Table 2 shows that all the subjects performed (sometimes much) better than chance, and against the null hypothesis that all subjects are guessing randomly, the results are statistically significant, p < 2−6 ≈ .016.

Given the “production” aspect of memorability discussed in § 1, we stihoonu”ld a saplesoc expect tmhaotr mabeimlityora dbislce quotes nw §il1l ,te wnde to appear more extensively on Web pages than nonmemorable quotes; note that incorporating this insight makes it possible to use the (implicit) judgments of a much larger number of people than are represented by the IMDb database. It therefore makes sense to try using search-engine result counts as a second indication of memorability. We experimented with several ways of constructing memorability information from search-engine counts, but this proved challenging. Searching for a quote as a stand-alone phrase runs into the problem that a number of quotes are also sentences that people use without the movie in mind, and so high counts for such quotes do not testify to the phrase’s status as a memorable quote from the movie. On the other hand, searching for the quote in a Boolean conjunction with the movie’s title discards most of these uses, but also eliminates a large fraction of the appearances on the Web that we want to find: precisely because memorable quotes tend to have widespread cultural usage, people generally don’t feel the need to include the movie’s title when invoking them. Finally, since we are dealing with roughly 1000 movies, the result counts vary over an enormous range, from recent blockbusters to movies with relatively small fan bases. In the end, we found that it was more effective to use the result counts in conjunction with the IMDb labels, so that the counts played the role of an additional filter rather than a free-standing numerical value. Thus, for each pair (M, N) produced using the IMDb methodology above, we searched for each of M and N as quoted expressions in a Boolean conjunction with the title of the movie. We then kept only those pairs for which M (i) produced more than five results in our (quoted, conjoined) search, and (ii) produced at least twice as many results as the cor6The average accuracy being below 100% reinforces that context is very important, too. 896 responding search for N. We created a version of this filtered dataset using each of Google and Bing, and all the main findings were consistent with the results on the IMDb-only dataset. Thus, in what follows, we will focus on the main IMDb-only dataset, discussing the relationship to the dataset filtered by search engine counts where relevant (in which case we will refer to the +Google dataset). 3 Never send a human to do a machine’s job. We now discuss experiments that investigate the hypotheses discussed in §1. In particular, we devise pmoetthheosdess t dhiastc can assess 1th.e Idnis ptianrcttiicvuelnaer,ss w aend d generality hypotheses and test whether there exists a notion of “memorable language” that operates across domains. In addition, we evaluate and compare the predictive power of these hypotheses. 3.1 Distinctiveness One of the hypotheses we examine is whether the use of language in memorable quotes is to some extent unusual. In order to quantify the level of distinctiveness of a quote, we take a language-model approach: we model “common language” using the newswire sections of the Brown corpus [21]7, and evaluate how distinctive a quote is by evaluating its likelihood with respect to this model the lower the likelihood, the more distinctive. In order to assess different levels of lexical and syntactic distinctiveness, we employ a total of six Laplacesmoothed8 language models: 1-gram, 2-gram, and — 3-gram word LMs and 1-gram, 2-gram and 3-gram LMs. We find strong evidence that from a lexical perspective, memorable quotes are more distinctive than their non-memorable counterparts. As indicated in Table 3, for each of our lexical “common language” models, in about 60% of the quote pairs, the memorable quote is more distinctive. Interestingly, the reverse is true when it comes to part-of-speech9 7Results were qualitatively similar if we used the fiction portions. The age of the Brown corpus makes it less likely to contain modern movie quotes. 8We employ Laplace (additive) smoothing with a smoothing parameter of 0.2. The language models’ vocabulary was that of the entire training corpus. 9Throughout we obtain part-of-speech tags by using the NLTK maximum entropy tagger with default parameters. in which the the memorable quote is more distinctive than the non-memorable one according to the respective “common language” model. Significance according to a two-tailed sign test is indicated using *-notation (∗∗∗=“p<.001”). syntax: memorable quotes appear to follow the syntactic patterns of “common language” as closely as or more closely than non-memorable quotes. Together, these results suggest that memorable quotes consist of unusual word sequences built on common syntactic scaffolding. 3.2 Generality Another of our hypotheses is that memorable quotes are easier to use outside the specific context in which they were uttered that is, more “portable” and therefore exhibit fewer terms that refer to those settings. We use the following syntactic properties as proxies for the generality of a quote: • Fewer 3rd-person pronouns, since these commonly r 3efer to a person or object that was introduced earlier in the discourse. Utterances that employ fewer such pronouns are easier to adapt to new contexts, and so will be considered more — — general. • More indefinite articles like a and an, since they are more likely ttioc lreesfer li ktoe general concepts than definite articles. Quotes with more indefinite articles will be considered more general. Fewer past tense verbs and more present tFeenwsee verbs, tseinncsee t vheer bfosrm aenrd are more likely to refer to specific previous events. Therefore utterances that employ fewer past tense verbs (and more present tense verbs) will be considered more general. Table 4 gives the results for each of these four metrics in each case, we show the percentage of • — 897 TalfmGebowsnre4pa:in3srGldet sypfne.msrate.lripnctysoe: purncsetaI56gM47e.326D9o710bf% -qo∗u n∗l tyepa+56iG892rs.o7i364ng% wl∗ eh∗i ch the memorable quote is more general than the non- memorable ones according to the respective metric. Pairs where the metric does not distinguish between the quotes are not considered. quote pairs for which the memorable quote scores better on the generality metric. Note that because the issue of generality is a complex one for which there is no straightforward single metric, our approach here is based on several proxies for generality, considered independently; yet, as the results show, all of these point in a consistent direction. It is an interesting open question to develop richer ways of assessing whether a quote has greater generality, in the sense that people intuitively attribute to memorable quotes. 3.3 “Memorable” language beyond movies One of the motivating questions in our analysis is whether there are general principles underlying “memorable language.” The results thus far suggest potential families of such principles. A further question in this direction is whether the notion of memorability can be extended across different domains, and for this we collected (and distribute on our website) 431 phrases that were explicitly designed to be memorable: advertising slogans (e.g., “Quality never goes out of style.”). The focus on slogans is also in keeping with one of the initial motivations in studying memorability, namely, marketing applications in other words, assessing whether a proposed slogan has features that are consistent with memorable text. The fact that it’s not clear how to construct a collection of “non-memorable” counterparts to slogans appears to pose a technical challenge. However, we can still use a language-modeling approach to assess whether the textual properties of the slogans are closer to the memorable movie quotes (as one would conjecture) or to the non-memorable movie quotes. Specifically, we train one language model on memorable quotes and another on non-memorable quotes — guage: percentage of slogans that have higher likelihood under the memorable language model than under the nonmemorable one (for each of the six language models considered). Rightmost column: for reference, the percentage of newswire sentences that have higher likelihood under the memorable language model than under the nonmemorable one.

(%s of 3rd pers. pronouns and indefinite articles are relative to all tokens, %s of past tense are relative to all past and present verbs.) and compare how likely each slogan is to be produced according to these two models. As shown in the middle column of Table 5, we find that slogans are better predicted both lexically and syntactically by the former model. This result thus offers evidence for a concept of “memorable language” that can be applied beyond a single domain. We also note that the higher likelihood of slogans under a “memorable language” model is not simply occurring for the trivial reason that this model predicts all other large bodies of text better. In particular, the newswire section of the Brown corpus is predicted better at the lexical level by the language model trained on non-memorable quotes. Finally, Table 6 shows that slogans employ general language, in the sense that for each of our generality metrics, we see a slogans/memorablequotes/non-memorable quotes spectrum. 3.4 Prediction task We now show how the principles discussed above can provide features for a basic prediction task, corresponding to the task in our human pilot study: 898 given a pair of quotes, identify the memorable one. Our first formulation of the prediction task uses a standard bag-of-words model10. If there were no information in the textual content of a quote to determine whether it were memorable, then an SVM employing bag-of-words features should perform no better than chance. Instead, though, it obtains 59.67% (10-fold cross-validation) accuracy, as shown in Table 7. We then develop models using features based on the measures formulated earlier in this section: generality measures (the four listed in Table 4); distinctiveness measures (likelihood according to 1, 2, and 3-gram “common language” models at the lexical and part-of-speech level for each quote in the pair, their differences, and pairwise comparisons between them); and similarityto-slogans measures (likelihood according to 1, 2, and 3-gram slogan-language models at the lexical and part-of-speech level for each quote in the pair, their differences, and pairwise comparisons between them). Even a relatively small number of distinctiveness features, on their own, improve significantly over the much larger bag-of-words model. When we include additional features based on generality and language-model features measuring similarity to slogans, the performance improves further (last line of Table 7). Thus, the main conclusion from these prediction tasks is that abstracting notions such as distinctiveness and generality can produce relatively streamlined models that outperform much heavier-weight bag-of-words models, and can suggest steps toward approaching the performance of human judges who very much unlike our system have the full cultural context in which movies occur at their disposal. — — 3.5 Other characteristics We also made some auxiliary observations that may be ofinterest. Specifically, we find differences in letter and sound distribution (e.g., memorable quotes after curse-word removal use significantly more “front sounds” (labials or front vowels such as represented by the letter i) and significantly fewer “back sounds” such as the one represented by u),11 — — 10We discarded terms appearing fewer than 10 times. 11These findings may relate to marketing research on sound symbolism [7, 19, 40].

Accuracies statistically significantly greater than bag-of-words according to a two-tailed t-test are indicated with *(p<.05) and **(p<.01). word complexity (e.g., memorable quotes use words with significantly more syllables) and phrase complexity (e.g., memorable quotes use fewer coordinating conjunctions). The latter two are in line with our distinctiveness hypothesis. 4 A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away How an item’s linguistic form affects the reaction it generates has been studied in several contexts, including evaluations of product reviews [9], political speeches [12], on-line posts [13], scientific papers [14], and retweeting of Twitter posts [36]. We use a different set of features, abstracting the notions of distinctiveness and generality, in order to focus on these higher-level aspects of phrasing rather than on particular lower-level features. Related to our interest in distinctiveness, work in advertising research has studied the effect of syntactic complexity on recognition and recall of slogans [5, 6, 24]. There may also be connections to Von Restorff’s isolation effect Hunt [17], which asserts that when all but one item in a list are similar in some way, memory for the different item is enhanced. Related to our interest in generality, Knapp et al. [20] surveyed subjects regarding memorable messages or pieces of advice they had received, finding that the ability to be applied to multiple concrete situations was an important factor. Memorability, although distinct from “memorizability”, relates to short- and long-term recall. Thorn and Page [34] survey sub-lexical, lexical, and semantic attributes affecting short-term memorability of lexical items. Studies of verbatim recall have also considered the task of distinguishing an exact quote from close paraphrases [3]. Investigations of longterm recall have included studies ofculturally signif- 899 icant passages of text [29] and findings regarding the effect of rhetorical devices of alliterative [4], “rhythmic, poetic, and thematic constraints” [18, 26]. Finally, there are complex connections between humor and memory [32], which may lead to interactions with computational humor recognition [25]. 5 I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Motivated by the broad question of what kinds of information achieve widespread public awareness, we studied the the effect of phrasing on a quote’s memorability. A challenge is that quotes differ not only in how they are worded, but also in who said them and under what circumstances; to deal with this difficulty, we constructed a controlled corpus of movie quotes in which lines deemed memorable are paired with non-memorable lines spoken by the same character at approximately the same point in the same movie. After controlling for context and situation, memorable quotes were still found to exhibit, on av- erage (there will always be individual exceptions), significant differences from non-memorable quotes in several important respects, including measures capturing distinctiveness and generality. Our experiments with slogans show how the principles we identify can extend to a different domain. Future work may lead to applications in marketing, advertising and education [4]. Moreover, the subtle nature of memorability, and its connection to research in psychology, suggests a range of further research directions. We believe that the framework developed here can serve as the basis for further computational studies of the process by which information takes hold in the public consciousness, and the role that language effects play in this process.

<p>Author: Jonathan K. Kummerfeld ; Dan Klein ; James R. Curran</p><p>Abstract: We propose an improved, bottom-up method for converting CCG derivations into PTB-style phrase structure trees. In contrast with past work (Clark and Curran, 2009), which used simple transductions on category pairs, our approach uses richer transductions attached to single categories. Our conversion preserves more sentences under round-trip conversion (5 1.1% vs. 39.6%) and is more robust. In particular, unlike past methods, ours does not require ad-hoc rules over non-local features, and so can be easily integrated into a parser.</p><p>4 0.46023908 <a title="197-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-A_Computational_Approach_to_the_Automation_of_Creative_Naming.html">7 acl-2012-A Computational Approach to the Automation of Creative Naming</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuping Zhou ; Nianwen Xue</p><p>Abstract: We describe a discourse annotation scheme for Chinese and report on the preliminary results. Our scheme, inspired by the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB), adopts the lexically grounded approach; at the same time, it makes adaptations based on the linguistic and statistical characteristics of Chinese text. Annotation results show that these adaptations work well in practice. Our scheme, taken together with other PDTB-style schemes (e.g. for English, Turkish, Hindi, and Czech), affords a broader perspective on how the generalized lexically grounded approach can flesh itself out in the context of cross-linguistic annotation of discourse relations.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.83031976 <a title="197-lda-2" href="./acl-2012-Tokenization%3A_Returning_to_a_Long_Solved_Problem__A_Survey%2C_Contrastive_Experiment%2C_Recommendations%2C_and_Toolkit_.html">197 acl-2012-Tokenization: Returning to a Long Solved Problem  A Survey, Contrastive Experiment, Recommendations, and Toolkit </a></p>
<p>Author: Rebecca Dridan ; Stephan Oepen</p><p>Abstract: We examine some of the frequently disregarded subtleties of tokenization in Penn Treebank style, and present a new rule-based preprocessing toolkit that not only reproduces the Treebank tokenization with unmatched accuracy, but also maintains exact stand-off pointers to the original text and allows flexible configuration to diverse use cases (e.g. to genreor domain-specific idiosyncrasies). 1 Introduction—Motivation The task of tokenization is hardly counted among the grand challenges of NLP and is conventionally interpreted as breaking up “natural language text [...] into distinct meaningful units (or tokens)” (Kaplan, 2005). Practically speaking, however, tokenization is often combined with other string-level preprocessing—for example normalization of punctuation (of different conventions for dashes, say), disambiguation of quotation marks (into opening vs. closing quotes), or removal of unwanted mark-up— where the specifics of such pre-processing depend both on properties of the input text as well as on assumptions made in downstream processing. Applying some string-level normalizationprior to the identification of token boundaries can improve (or simplify) tokenization, and a sub-task like the disambiguation of quote marks would in fact be hard to perform after tokenization, seeing that it depends on adjacency to whitespace. In the following, we thus assume a generalized notion of tokenization, comprising all string-level processing up to and including the conversion of a sequence of characters (a string) to a sequence of token objects.1 1Obviously, some of the normalization we include in the tokenization task (in this generalized interpretation) could be left to downstream analysis, where a tagger or parser, for example, could be expected to accept non-disambiguated quote marks (so-called straight or typewriter quotes) and disambiguate as 378 Arguably, even in an overtly ‘separating’ language like English, there can be token-level ambiguities that ultimately can only be resolved through parsing (see § 3 for candidate examples), and indeed Waldron et al. (2006) entertain the idea of downstream processing on a token lattice. In this article, however, we accept the tokenization conventions and sequential nature of the Penn Treebank (PTB; Marcus et al., 1993) as a useful point of reference— primarily for interoperability of different NLP tools. Still, we argue, there is remaining work to be done on PTB-compliant tokenization (reviewed in§ 2), both methodologically, practically, and technologically. In § 3 we observe that state-of-the-art tools perform poorly on re-creating PTB tokenization, and move on in § 4 to develop a modular, parameterizable, and transparent framework for tokenization. Besides improvements in tokenization accuracy and adaptability to diverse use cases, in § 5 we further argue that each token object should unambiguously link back to an underlying element of the original input, which in the case of tokenization of text we realize through a notion of characterization. 2 Common Conventions Due to the popularity of the PTB, its tokenization has been a de-facto standard for two decades. Ap- proximately, this means splitting off punctuation into separate tokens, disambiguating straight quotes, and separating contractions such as can’t into ca and n ’t. There are, however, many special cases— part of syntactic analysis. However, on the (predominant) point of view that punctuation marks form tokens in their own right, the tokenizer would then have to adorn quote marks in some way, as to whether they were split off the left or right periphery of a larger token, to avoid unwanted syntactic ambiguity. Further, increasing use of Unicode makes texts containing ‘natively’ disambiguated quotes more common, where it would seem unfortunate to discard linguistically pertinent information by normalizing towards the poverty of pure ASCII punctuation.

In much tagging and parsing work, PTB data has been used with gold-standard tokens, to a point where many researchers are unaware of the existence of the original ‘raw’ (untokenized) text. Accordingly, the formal definition of PTB has received little attention, but reproducing PTB tokenization automatically actually is not a trivial task (see § 3). As the NLP community has moved to process data other than the PTB, some of the limitations of the tokenization2 PTB tokenization have been recognized, and many recently released data sets are accompanied by a note on tokenization along the lines of: Tokenization is similar to that used in PTB, except . . . Most exceptions are to do with hyphenation, or special forms of named entities such as chemical names or URLs. None of the documentation with extant data sets is sufficient to fully reproduce the tokenization.3 The CoNLL 2008 Shared Task data actually provided two forms of tokenization: that from the PTB (which many pre-processing tools would have been trained on), and another form that splits (most) hyphenated terms. This latter convention recently seems to be gaining ground in data sets like the Google 1T n-gram corpus (LDC #2006T13) and OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006). Clearly, as one moves towards a more application- and domaindriven idea of ‘correct’ tokenization, a more transparent, flexible, and adaptable approach to stringlevel pre-processing is called for. 3 A Contrastive Experiment To get an overview of current tokenization methods, we recovered and tokenized the raw text which was the source of the (Wall Street Journal portion of the) PTB, and compared it to the gold tokenization in the syntactic annotation in the We used three common methods of tokenization: (a) the original treebank.4 2See http : / /www . cis .upenn .edu/ ~t reebank/ t okeni z at ion .html for available ‘documentation’ and a sed script for PTB-style tokenization. 3Øvrelid et al. (2010) observe that tokenizing with the GENIA tagger yields mismatches in one of five sentences of the GENIA Treebank, although the GENIA guidelines refer to scripts that may be available on request (Tateisi & Tsujii, 2006). 4The original WSJ text was last included with the 1995 release of the PTB (LDC #95T07) and required alignment with the treebank, with some manual correction so that the same text is represented in both raw and parsed formats. 379 Tokenization Differing Levenshtein Method Sentences Distance tokenizer.sed 3264 11168 CoreNLP 1781 3717 C&J; parser 2597 4516 Table 1: Quantitative view on tokenization differences. PTB tokenizer.sed script; (b) the tokenizer from the Stanford CoreNLP tools5; and (c) tokenization from the parser of Charniak & Johnson (2005). Table 1 shows quantitative differences between each of the three methods and the PTB, both in terms of the number of sentences where the tokenization differs, and also in the total Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein, 1966) over tokens (for a total of 49,208 sentences and 1,173,750 gold-standard tokens). Looking at the differences qualitatively, the most consistent issue across all tokenization methods was ambiguity of sentence-final periods. In the treebank, final periods are always (with about 10 exceptions) a separate token. If the sentence ends in U.S. (but not other abbreviations, oddly), an extra period is hallucinated, so the abbreviation also has one. In contrast, C&J; add a period to all final abbreviations, CoreNLP groups the final period with a final abbreviation and hence lacks a sentence-final period token, and the sed script strips the period off U.S. The ‘correct’ choice in this case is not obvious and will depend on how the tokens are to be used. The majority of the discrepancies in the sed script tokenization come from an under-restricted punctuation rule that incorrectly splits on commas within numbers or ampersands within names. Other than that, the problematic cases are mostly shared across tokenization methods, and include issues with currencies, Irish names, hyphenization, and quote disambiguation. In addition, C&J; make some additional modifications to the text, lemmatising expressions such as won ’t as will and n ’t. 4 REPP: A Generalized Framework For tokenization to be studied as a first-class problem, and to enable customization and flexibility to diverse use cases, we suggest a non-procedural, rule-based framework dubbed REPP (Regular 5See corenlp / / nlp . st anford . edu / so ftware / run in ‘ st rict Treebank3 ’ mode. http : . shtml, Expression-Based Pre-Processing)—essentially a cascade of ordered finite-state string rewriting rules, though transcending the formal complexity of regular languages by inclusion of (a) full perl-compatible regular expressions and (b) fixpoint iteration over groups of rules. In this approach, a first phase of string-level substitutions inserts whitespace around, for example, punctuation marks; upon completion of string rewriting, token boundaries are stipulated between all whitespace-separated substrings (and only these). For a good balance of human and machine readability, REPP tokenization rules are specified in a simple, line-oriented textual form. Figure 1 shows a (simplified) excerpt from our PTB-style tokenizer, where the first character on each line is one of four REPP operators, as follows: (a) ‘#’ for group formation; (b) ‘>’ for group invocation, (c) ‘ ! ’ for substitution (allowing capture groups), and (d) ‘ : ’ for token boundary detection.6 In Figure 1, the two rules stripping off prefix and suffix punctuation marks adjacent to whitespace (i.e. matching the tab-separated left-hand side of the rule, to replace the match with its right-hand side) form a numbered group (‘# 1’), which will be iterated when called (‘> 1 until none ’) of the rules in the group fires (a fixpoint). In this example, conditioning on whitespace adjacency avoids the issues observed with the PTB sed script (e.g. token boundaries within comma-separated numbers) and also protects against infinite loops in the group.7 REPP rule sets can be organized as modules, typ6Strictly speaking, there are another two operators, for lineoriented comments and automated versioning of rule files. 7For this example, the same effects seemingly could be obtained without iteration (using greatly more complex rules); our actual, non-simplified rules, however, further deal with punctuation marks that can function as prefixes or suffixes, as well as with corner cases like factor(s) or Ca[2+]. Also in mark-up removal and normalization, we have found it necessary to ‘parse’ nested structures by means of iterative groups. 380 ically each in a file of its own, and invoked selectively by name (e.g. ‘>wiki’ in Figure 1); to date, there exist modules for quote disambiguation, (relevant subsets of) various mark-up languages (HTML, LATEX, wiki, and XML), and a handful of robustness rules (e.g. seeking to identify and repair ‘sandwiched’ inter-token punctuation). Individual tokenizers are configured at run-time, by selectively activating a set of modules (through command-line op- tions). An open-source reference implementation of the REPP framework (in C++) is available, together with a library of modules for English. 5 Characterization for Traceability Tokenization, and specifically our notion of generalized tokenization which allows text normalization, involves changes to the original text being analyzed, rather than just additional annotation. As such, full traceability from the token objects to the original text is required, which we formalize as ‘characterization’, in terms of character position links back to the source.8 This has the practical benefit of allowing downstream analysis as direct (stand-off) annotation on the source text, as seen for example in the ACL Anthology Searchbench (Schäfer et al., 2011). With our general regular expression replacement rules in REPP, making precise what it means for a token to link back to its ‘underlying’ substring requires some care in the design and implementation.

Each character in the string being processed has a start and end position, marking the point before and after the character in the original string. Before processing, the end position would always be one greater than the start position. However, if a rule mapped a string-initial, PTB-style opening double quote (``) to one-character Unicode “, the new first character of the string would have start position 0, but end position 2. In contrast, if there were a rule !wo (n’ t ) will \1 (1) applied to the string I ’t go!, all characters in the won second token of the resulting string (I will n’t go!) will have start position 2 and end position 4.

When repeating the experiment of § 3 above using REPP tokenization, we obtained an initial difference in 1505 sentences, with a Levenshtein dis10This subtlety will actually be invisible in the final token objects if will remains a single token, but if subsequent rules were to split this token further, all its output tokens would have a start position of 2 and an end position of 4. While this example may seem unlikely, we have come across similar scenarios in fine-tuning actual REPP rules. 381 tance of 3543 (broadly comparable to CoreNLP, if marginally more accurate). Examining these discrepancies, we revealed some deficiencies in our rules, as well as some peculiarities of the ‘raw’ Wall Street Journal text from the PTB distribution. A little more than 200 mismatches were owed to improper treatment of currency symbols (AU$) and decade abbreviations (’60s), which led to the refinement of two existing rules. Notable PTB idiosyncrasies (in the sense of deviations from common typography) include ellipses with spaces separating the periods and a fairly large number of possessives (’s) being separated from their preceding token. Other aspects of gold-standard PTB tokenization we consider unwarranted ‘damage’ to the input text, such as hallucinating an extra period after U . S . and splitting cannot (which adds spurious ambiguity). For use cases where the goal were strict compliance, for instance in pre-processing inputs for a PTB-derived parser, we added an optional REPP module (of currently half a dozen rules) to cater to these corner cases—in a spirit similar to the CoreNLP mode we used in § 3. With these extra rules, remaining tokenization discrepancies are contained in 603 sentences (just over 1%), which gives a Levenshtein distance of 1389. 7 Discussion—Conclusion Compared to the best-performing off-the-shelf system in our earlier experiment (where it is reasonable to assume that PTB data has played at least some role in development), our results eliminate two thirds of the remaining tokenization errors—a more substantial reduction than recent improvements in parsing accuracy against the PTB, for example. Of the remaining differences, cerned with mid-sentence at least half of those riod was separated treebank—a pattern Some differences over 350 are con- period ambiguity, are instances where where from an abbreviation a pein the we do not wish to emulate. in quote disambiguation also re- main, often triggered by whitespace on both sides of quote marks in the raw text. The final 200 or so dif- ferences stem from manual corrections made during treebanking, and we consider that these cases could not be replicated automatically in any generalizable fashion.

<p>Author: Pradeep Dasigi ; Weiwei Guo ; Mona Diab</p><p>Abstract: We describe an unsupervised approach to the problem of automatically detecting subgroups of people holding similar opinions in a discussion thread. An intuitive way of identifying this is to detect the attitudes of discussants towards each other or named entities or topics mentioned in the discussion. Sentiment tags play an important role in this detection, but we also note another dimension to the detection of people’s attitudes in a discussion: if two persons share the same opinion, they tend to use similar language content. We consider the latter to be an implicit attitude. In this paper, we investigate the impact of implicit and explicit attitude in two genres of social media discussion data, more formal wikipedia discussions and a debate discussion forum that is much more informal. Experimental results strongly suggest that implicit attitude is an important complement for explicit attitudes (expressed via sentiment) and it can improve the sub-group detection performance independent of genre.</p><p>4 0.49909571 <a title="197-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Chinese_Comma_Disambiguation_for_Discourse_Analysis.html">47 acl-2012-Chinese Comma Disambiguation for Discourse Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Yaqin Yang ; Nianwen Xue</p><p>Abstract: The Chinese comma signals the boundary of discourse units and also anchors discourse relations between adjacent text spans. In this work, we propose a discourse structureoriented classification of the comma that can be automatically extracted from the Chinese Treebank based on syntactic patterns. We then experimented with two supervised learning methods that automatically disambiguate the Chinese comma based on this classification. The first method integrates comma classification into parsing, and the second method adopts a “post-processing” approach that extracts features from automatic parses to train a classifier. The experimental results show that the second approach compares favorably against the first approach.</p><p>5 0.49549308 <a title="197-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Subgroup_Detection_in_Ideological_Discussions.html">187 acl-2012-Subgroup Detection in Ideological Discussions</a></p>
<p>Author: Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Pradeep Dasigi ; Mona Diab ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: The rapid and continuous growth of social networking sites has led to the emergence of many communities of communicating groups. Many of these groups discuss ideological and political topics. It is not uncommon that the participants in such discussions split into two or more subgroups. The members of each subgroup share the same opinion toward the discussion topic and are more likely to agree with members of the same subgroup and disagree with members from opposing subgroups. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach for automatically detecting discussant subgroups in online communities. We analyze the text exchanged between the participants of a discussion to identify the attitude they carry toward each other and towards the various aspects of the discussion topic. We use attitude predictions to construct an attitude vector for each discussant. We use clustering techniques to cluster these vectors and, hence, determine the subgroup membership of each participant. We compare our methods to text clustering and other baselines, and show that our method achieves promising results.</p><p>6 0.48478329 <a title="197-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Cross-lingual_Parse_Disambiguation_based_on_Semantic_Correspondence.html">63 acl-2012-Cross-lingual Parse Disambiguation based on Semantic Correspondence</a></p>

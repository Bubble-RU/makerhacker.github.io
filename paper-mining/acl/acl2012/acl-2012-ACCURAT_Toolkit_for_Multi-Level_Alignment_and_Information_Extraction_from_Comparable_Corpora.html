<p>Author: Ashish Vaswani ; Liang Huang ; David Chiang</p><p>Abstract: Two decades after their invention, the IBM word-based translation models, widely available in the GIZA++ toolkit, remain the dominant approach to word alignment and an integral part of many statistical translation systems. Although many models have surpassed them in accuracy, none have supplanted them in practice. In this paper, we propose a simple extension to the IBM models: an ‘0 prior to encourage sparsity in the word-to-word translation model. We explain how to implement this extension efficiently for large-scale data (also released as a modification to GIZA++) and demonstrate, in experiments on Czech, Arabic, Chinese, and Urdu to English translation, significant improvements over IBM Model 4 in both word alignment (up to +6.7 F1) and translation quality (up to +1.4 B ).</p><p>3 0.1714568 <a title="1-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Learning_to_Find_Translations_and_Transliterations_on_the_Web.html">134 acl-2012-Learning to Find Translations and Transliterations on the Web</a></p>

In this paper, we present a new method on the for learning to finding translations and transliterations on the Web for a given term. The approach involves using a small set of terms and translations to obtain mixed-code snippets from a search engine, and automatically annotating the snippets with tags and features for training a conditional random field model. At runtime, the model is used to extracting translation candidates for a given term. Preliminary experiments and evaluation show our method cleanly combining various features, resulting in a system that outperforms previous work. 1</p><p>4 0.16325176 <a title="1-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Machine_Translation_without_Words_through_Substring_Alignment.html">140 acl-2012-Machine Translation without Words through Substring Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Graham Neubig ; Taro Watanabe ; Shinsuke Mori ; Tatsuya Kawahara</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that accurate machine translation is possible without the concept of “words,” treating MT as a problem of transformation between character strings. We achieve this result by applying phrasal inversion transduction grammar alignment techniques to character strings to train a character-based translation model, and using this in the phrase-based MT framework. We also propose a look-ahead parsing algorithm and substring-informed prior probabilities to achieve more effective and efficient alignment. In an evaluation, we demonstrate that character-based translation can achieve results that compare to word-based systems while effectively translating unknown and uncommon words over several language pairs.</p><p>5 0.15900876 <a title="1-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Building_Trainable_Taggers_in_a_Web-based%2C_UIMA-Supported_NLP_Workbench.html">43 acl-2012-Building Trainable Taggers in a Web-based, UIMA-Supported NLP Workbench</a></p>
<p>Author: Rafal Rak ; BalaKrishna Kolluru ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: Argo is a web-based NLP and text mining workbench with a convenient graphical user interface for designing and executing processing workflows of various complexity. The workbench is intended for specialists and nontechnical audiences alike, and provides the ever expanding library of analytics compliant with the Unstructured Information Management Architecture, a widely adopted interoperability framework. We explore the flexibility of this framework by demonstrating workflows involving three processing components capable of performing self-contained machine learning-based tagging. The three components are responsible for the three distinct tasks of 1) generating observations or features, 2) training a statistical model based on the generated features, and 3) tagging unlabelled data with the model. The learning and tagging components are based on an implementation of conditional random fields (CRF); whereas the feature generation component is an analytic capable of extending basic token information to a comprehensive set of features. Users define the features of their choice directly from Argo’s graphical interface, without resorting to programming (a commonly used approach to feature engineering). The experimental results performed on two tagging tasks, chunking and named entity recognition, showed that a tagger with a generic set of features built in Argo is capable of competing with taskspecific solutions. 121</p><p>6 0.14881772 <a title="1-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-NiuTrans%3A_An_Open_Source_Toolkit_for_Phrase-based_and_Syntax-based_Machine_Translation.html">155 acl-2012-NiuTrans: An Open Source Toolkit for Phrase-based and Syntax-based Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Elif Yamangil ; Stuart Shieber</p><p>Abstract: We present a Bayesian nonparametric model for estimating tree insertion grammars (TIG), building upon recent work in Bayesian inference of tree substitution grammars (TSG) via Dirichlet processes. Under our general variant of TIG, grammars are estimated via the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm that uses a context free grammar transformation as a proposal, which allows for cubic-time string parsing as well as tree-wide joint sampling of derivations in the spirit of Cohn and Blunsom (2010). We use the Penn treebank for our experiments and find that our proposal Bayesian TIG model not only has competitive parsing performance but also finds compact yet linguistically rich TIG representations of the data.</p><p>4 0.63308185 <a title="1-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Learning_the_Latent_Semantics_of_a_Concept_from_its_Definition.html">132 acl-2012-Learning the Latent Semantics of a Concept from its Definition</a></p>
<p>Author: Weiwei Guo ; Mona Diab</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we study unsupervised word sense disambiguation (WSD) based on sense definition. We learn low-dimensional latent semantic vectors of concept definitions to construct a more robust sense similarity measure wmfvec. Experiments on four all-words WSD data sets show significant improvement over the baseline WSD systems and LDA based similarity measures, achieving results comparable to state of the art WSD systems.</p><p>5 0.54398119 <a title="1-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Cross-lingual_Parse_Disambiguation_based_on_Semantic_Correspondence.html">63 acl-2012-Cross-lingual Parse Disambiguation based on Semantic Correspondence</a></p>
<p>Author: Lea Frermann ; Francis Bond</p><p>Abstract: We present a system for cross-lingual parse disambiguation, exploiting the assumption that the meaning of a sentence remains unchanged during translation and the fact that different languages have different ambiguities. We simultaneously reduce ambiguity in multiple languages in a fully automatic way. Evaluation shows that the system reliably discards dispreferred parses from the raw parser output, which results in a pre-selection that can speed up manual treebanking.</p><p>6 0.54342592 <a title="1-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-A_Ranking-based_Approach_to_Word_Reordering_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">19 acl-2012-A Ranking-based Approach to Word Reordering for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Malte Nuhn ; Arne Mauser ; Hermann Ney</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we show how to train statistical machine translation systems on reallife tasks using only non-parallel monolingual data from two languages. We present a modification of the method shown in (Ravi and Knight, 2011) that is scalable to vocabulary sizes of several thousand words. On the task shown in (Ravi and Knight, 2011) we obtain better results with only 5% of the computational effort when running our method with an n-gram language model. The efficiency improvement of our method allows us to run experiments with vocabulary sizes of around 5,000 words, such as a non-parallel version of the VERBMOBIL corpus. We also report results using data from the monolingual French and English GIGAWORD corpora.</p><p>3 0.086458966 <a title="68-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Iterative_Viterbi_A%2A_Algorithm_for_K-Best_Sequential_Decoding.html">121 acl-2012-Iterative Viterbi A* Algorithm for K-Best Sequential Decoding</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhiheng Huang ; Yi Chang ; Bo Long ; Jean-Francois Crespo ; Anlei Dong ; Sathiya Keerthi ; Su-Lin Wu</p><p>Abstract: Sequential modeling has been widely used in a variety of important applications including named entity recognition and shallow parsing. However, as more and more real time large-scale tagging applications arise, decoding speed has become a bottleneck for existing sequential tagging algorithms. In this paper we propose 1-best A*, 1-best iterative A*, k-best A* and k-best iterative Viterbi A* algorithms for sequential decoding. We show the efficiency of these proposed algorithms for five NLP tagging tasks. In particular, we show that iterative Viterbi A* decoding can be several times or orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm for tagging tasks with a large number of labels. This algorithm makes real-time large-scale tagging applications with thousands of labels feasible.</p><p>4 0.084709167 <a title="68-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Private_Access_to_Phrase_Tables_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">164 acl-2012-Private Access to Phrase Tables for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Tong Xiao ; Jingbo Zhu ; Hao Zhang ; Qiang Li</p><p>Abstract: We present a new open source toolkit for phrase-based and syntax-based machine translation. The toolkit supports several state-of-the-art models developed in statistical machine translation, including the phrase-based model, the hierachical phrase-based model, and various syntaxbased models. The key innovation provided by the toolkit is that the decoder can work with various grammars and offers different choices of decoding algrithms, such as phrase-based decoding, decoding as parsing/tree-parsing and forest-based decoding. Moreover, several useful utilities were distributed with the toolkit, including a discriminative reordering model, a simple and fast language model, and an implementation of minimum error rate training for weight tuning. 1</p><p>6 0.043304726 <a title="68-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Exploring_Deterministic_Constraints%3A_from_a_Constrained_English_POS_Tagger_to_an_Efficient_ILP_Solution_to_Chinese_Word_Segmentation.html">89 acl-2012-Exploring Deterministic Constraints: from a Constrained English POS Tagger to an Efficient ILP Solution to Chinese Word Segmentation</a></p>

<p>Author: Stephen Tyndall</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents the problem within Hittite and Ancient Near Eastern studies of fragmented and damaged cuneiform texts, and proposes to use well-known text classification metrics, in combination with some facts about the structure of Hittite-language cuneiform texts, to help classify a number offragments of clay cuneiform-script tablets into more complete texts. In particular, Ipropose using Sumerian and Akkadian ideogrammatic signs within Hittite texts to improve the performance of Naive Bayes and Maximum Entropy classifiers. The performance in some cases is improved, and in some cases very much not, suggesting that the variable frequency of occurrence of these ideograms in individual fragments makes considerable difference in the ideal choice for a classification method. Further, complexities of the writing system and the digital availability ofHittite texts complicate the problem.</p><p>5 0.34407479 <a title="68-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-Fast_and_Scalable_Decoding_with_Language_Model_Look-Ahead_for_Phrase-based_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">97 acl-2012-Fast and Scalable Decoding with Language Model Look-Ahead for Phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Joern Wuebker ; Hermann Ney ; Richard Zens</p><p>Abstract: In this work we present two extensions to the well-known dynamic programming beam search in phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT), aiming at increased efficiency of decoding by minimizing the number of language model computations and hypothesis expansions. Our results show that language model based pre-sorting yields a small improvement in translation quality and a speedup by a factor of 2. Two look-ahead methods are shown to further increase translation speed by a factor of2 without changing the search space and a factor of 4 with the side-effect of some additional search errors. We compare our ap- proach with Moses and observe the same performance, but a substantially better trade-off between translation quality and speed. At a speed of roughly 70 words per second, Moses reaches 17.2% BLEU, whereas our approach yields 20.0% with identical models.</p><p>6 0.33527848 <a title="68-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-Deciphering_Foreign_Language_by_Combining_Language_Models_and_Context_Vectors.html">67 acl-2012-Deciphering Foreign Language by Combining Language Models and Context Vectors</a></p>

<p>Author: Yunyao Li ; Laura Chiticariu ; Huahai Yang ; Frederick Reiss ; Arnaldo Carreno-fuentes</p><p>Abstract: Information extraction (IE) is becoming a critical building block in many enterprise applications. In order to satisfy the increasing text analytics demands of enterprise applications, it is crucial to enable developers with general computer science background to develop high quality IE extractors. In this demonstration, we present WizIE, an IE development environment intended to reduce the development life cycle and enable developers with little or no linguistic background to write high quality IE rules. WizI E provides an integrated wizard-like environment that guides IE developers step-by-step throughout the entire development process, based on best practices synthesized from the experience of expert developers. In addition, WizIE reduces the manual effort involved in performing key IE development tasks by offering automatic result explanation and rule discovery functionality. Preliminary results indicate that WizI E is a step forward towards enabling extractor development for novice IE developers.</p><p>4 0.43024343 <a title="68-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Bayesian_Symbol-Refined_Tree_Substitution_Grammars_for_Syntactic_Parsing.html">38 acl-2012-Bayesian Symbol-Refined Tree Substitution Grammars for Syntactic Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Hiroyuki Shindo ; Yusuke Miyao ; Akinori Fujino ; Masaaki Nagata</p><p>Abstract: We propose Symbol-Refined Tree Substitution Grammars (SR-TSGs) for syntactic parsing. An SR-TSG is an extension of the conventional TSG model where each nonterminal symbol can be refined (subcategorized) to fit the training data. We aim to provide a unified model where TSG rules and symbol refinement are learned from training data in a fully automatic and consistent fashion. We present a novel probabilistic SR-TSG model based on the hierarchical Pitman-Yor Process to encode backoff smoothing from a fine-grained SR-TSG to simpler CFG rules, and develop an efficient training method based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Our SR-TSG parser achieves an F1 score of 92.4% in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) English Penn Treebank parsing task, which is a 7.7 point improvement over a conventional Bayesian TSG parser, and better than state-of-the-art discriminative reranking parsers.</p><p>5 0.39883304 <a title="68-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Estimating_Compact_Yet_Rich_Tree_Insertion_Grammars.html">84 acl-2012-Estimating Compact Yet Rich Tree Insertion Grammars</a></p>
<p>Author: Elif Yamangil ; Stuart Shieber</p><p>Abstract: We present a Bayesian nonparametric model for estimating tree insertion grammars (TIG), building upon recent work in Bayesian inference of tree substitution grammars (TSG) via Dirichlet processes. Under our general variant of TIG, grammars are estimated via the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm that uses a context free grammar transformation as a proposal, which allows for cubic-time string parsing as well as tree-wide joint sampling of derivations in the spirit of Cohn and Blunsom (2010).

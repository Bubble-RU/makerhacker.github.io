</p><p>2 Recent work by Chen and Mooney (201 1) introduced a lexicon learning method that deals with ambiguous relational data by taking intersections of graphs. [sent-5, score-0.385]
</p><p>3 While the algorithm produced good lexicons for the task of learning to interpret navigation instructions, it only works in batch settings and does not scale well to large datasets. [sent-6, score-0.697]
</p><p>4 More recently, there has been work on learning from ambiguous supervision where a set of potential sentence meanings are given, only one (or a small subset) of which are correct (Chen and Mooney, 2008; Liang et al. [sent-13, score-0.255]
</p><p>5 Building a lexicon of the formal meaning representations of words and phrases, either implicitly or explicitly, is usually an important step in inferring the meanings of entire sentences. [sent-17, score-0.358]
</p><p>6 In particular, Chen and Mooney (201 1) first learned a lexicon to help them resolve ambiguous supervision of relational data in which the number of choices is exponential. [sent-18, score-0.347]
</p><p>7 Their lexicon learning algorithm finds the common connected subgraph that occurs with a word by taking intersections of the graphs that represent the different contexts in which the word appears. [sent-20, score-0.633]
</p><p>8 While the algorithm produced a good lexicon for their application of learning to interpret navigation instructions, it only works in batch settings and does not scale well to large datasets. [sent-21, score-0.889]
</p><p>9 However, constructing such semantic annotations can be  algorithm that is an order of magnitude faster and also produces better results on their navigation task. [sent-26, score-0.696]
</p><p>10 In addition to the new lexicon learning algorithm, we also look at modifying the meaning representation grammar (MRG) for their formal semantic language. [sent-27, score-0.422]
</p><p>11 By using a MRG that correlates better to the structure of natural language, we further improve the performance on the navigation task. [sent-28, score-0.511]
</p><p>12 2  Background  A common way to learn a lexicon across many different contexts is to find the common parts ofthe formal representations associated with different occurrences of the same words or phrases (Siskind, 1996). [sent-33, score-0.234]
</p><p>13 For graphical representations, this involves finding the common subgraph between multiple graphs (Thompson and Mooney, 2003; Chen and Mooney, 2011). [sent-34, score-0.219]
</p><p>14 In this section we review the lexicon learning algorithm introduced by Chen and Mooney (201 1) as well as the overall task they designed to test semantic understanding of navigation instructions. [sent-35, score-0.853]
</p><p>15 1 Navigation Task The goal of the navigation task is to build a system that can understand free-form natural-language instructions and follow them to move to the intended destination (MacMahon et al. [sent-37, score-0.758]
</p><p>16 Chen and Mooney (201 1) defined a learning task in which the only supervision the system receives is in the form of observing how humans behave when following sample navigation instructions in a virtual world. [sent-41, score-0.891]
</p><p>17 turn your back against the wall and walk to the couch), Chen and Mooney first use a set of rules to automatically construct the space of reasonable plans using the action trace and knowledge about the world. [sent-51, score-0.281]
</p><p>18 The space is represented compactly using a graph as shown in 431  Figure 1: Examples of landmarks plans constructed by Chen and Mooney (2011) and how they computed the intersection of two graphs. [sent-52, score-0.317]
</p><p>19 Given that these landmarks plans contain a lot of extraneous details, Chen and Mooney learn a lexicon and use it to identify and remove the irrelevant parts of the plans. [sent-55, score-0.427]
</p><p>20 The remaining refined landmarks plans are then treated as supervised training data for a semantic-parser learner,  KRISP (Kate and Mooney, 2006). [sent-57, score-0.266]
</p><p>21 Once a semantic parser is trained, it can be used at test time to transform novel instructions into formal navigation plans which are then carried out by a virtual robot (MacMahon et al. [sent-58, score-1.096]
</p><p>22 2 Lexicon Learning The central component of the system is the lexicon learning process which associates words and short phrases (n-grams) to their meanings (connected graphs). [sent-61, score-0.292]
</p><p>23 To learn the meaning of an n-gram w, Chen and Mooney first collect all navigation plans g that co-occur with w. [sent-62, score-0.73]
</p><p>24 They use the term intersection to mean a maximal common subgraph (i. [sent-65, score-0.223]
</p><p>25 it is not a subgraph of any other common subgraphs). [sent-67, score-0.17]
</p><p>26 In this case, they bias toward finding large connected components by greedily removing the largest common connected subgraph from both graphs until the two graphs have no overlapping nodes. [sent-69, score-0.386]
</p><p>27 Moreover, reducing the beam size could also hurt the quality of the lexicon learned. [sent-78, score-0.192]
</p><p>28 In this section, we present another lexicon learning algorithm that is much faster and works in an online setting. [sent-79, score-0.343]
</p><p>29 Using this constraint, we generate all the potential small connected subgraphs for each navigation plan in the training examples and discard the original graph. [sent-82, score-0.739]
</p><p>30 As we encounter each new training example which consists of a written navigation instruction 432  Algorithm 1 SUBGRAPHGENERATIONONLINE LEXICON LEARNING (SGOLL) input Asequenceofnavigationinstructions and the corresponding navigation plans  (e1,p1),  . [sent-84, score-1.37]
</p><p>31 From the corresponding navigation plan, we find all connected subgraphs of size less than or equal to m. [sent-88, score-0.708]
</p><p>32 We then update the cooccurrence counts between all the n-grams w and all the connected subgraphs g. [sent-89, score-0.268]
</p><p>33 We also update the counts of how many examples we have encountered so far and counts of the n-grams w and subgraphs g. [sent-90, score-0.245]
</p><p>34 At any given time, we can compute a lexicon using these various counts. [sent-91, score-0.192]
</p><p>35 Specifically, for each n-gram w, we look at all the subgraphs g that co-  occurred with it, and compute a score for the pair (w, g). [sent-92, score-0.17]
</p><p>36 This is to prevent rarely seen n-grams from receiving high scores in our lexicon simply due to their sparsity. [sent-96, score-0.192]
</p><p>37 4, maximum subgraph size m = 3, and minimum support minSup = 10. [sent-98, score-0.17]
</p><p>38 It should be noted that SGOLL can also become computationally intractable if the sizes of the navigations plans are large or if we set the maximum subgraph size m to a large number. [sent-99, score-0.336]
</p><p>39 This allows us to determine iftwo graphs are identical in constant time and also lets us use a hash table to quickly update the co-occurrence and subgraph counts. [sent-103, score-0.254]
</p><p>40 Thus, even given a large number of subgraphs for each training example, each subgraph can be processed very quickly. [sent-104, score-0.339]
</p><p>41 1 Changing the Meaning Representation Grammar In addition to introducing a new lexicon learning algorithm, we also made another modification to the original system proposed by Chen and Mooney (201 1). [sent-109, score-0.221]
</p><p>42 To train a semantic parser using KRISP (Kate and Mooney, 2006), they had to supply a MRG, a context-free grammar, for their formal navigation plan language. [sent-110, score-0.685]
</p><p>43 For example, the original MRG contained the following production rules for generating an infinite number of travel actions from the root symbol S. [sent-116, score-0.22]
</p><p>44 4 Collecting Additional Data with Mechanical Turk One of the motivations for studying ambiguous supervision is the potential ease of acquiring large amounts of training data. [sent-120, score-0.186]
</p><p>45 We validate this claim by collecting additional training data for the navigation domain using Mechanical Turk (Snow et al. [sent-122, score-0.593]
</p><p>46 There are two types of data we are interested in  collecting: natural language navigation instructions and follower data. [sent-124, score-0.867]
</p><p>47 The first one asks the workers to supply instructions for a randomly generated sequence of actions. [sent-126, score-0.319]
</p><p>48 The second one asks the workers to try to follow a given navigation instruction in our virtual environment. [sent-127, score-0.819]
</p><p>49 The latter task is used to generate the corresponding action sequences for instructions collected from the first task. [sent-128, score-0.304]
</p><p>50 The worker is given a navigation instruction and placed at the starting location. [sent-135, score-0.701]
</p><p>51 They are asked to follow the navigation instruction as best as they could using the three discrete controls. [sent-136, score-0.691]
</p><p>52 They could also skip the problem if they did not understand the instruction or if the instruction did not de-  scribe a viable route. [sent-137, score-0.302]
</p><p>53 For each Human Intelligence Task (HIT), we asked the worker to complete 5 follower problems. [sent-138, score-0.177]
</p><p>54 The instructions used for the follower problems were mainly collected from our Mechanical Turk instructor task with some of the instructions coming from data collected by MacMahon (2007) that was not used by Chen and Mooney (201 1). [sent-141, score-0.71]
</p><p>55 The instructor task is slightly more involved because we ask the workers to provide new navigation 434  VA#ovingcas. [sent-142, score-0.671]
</p><p>56 r21k4)  Table 1: Statistics about the navigation instruction corpora. [sent-147, score-0.662]
</p><p>57 The worker is shown a 3D simulation of a randomly generated action sequence between length 1 to 4 and asked to write short, free-form instructions that would lead someone to perform those actions. [sent-150, score-0.305]
</p><p>58 Workers who have been identified to consistently provide good instructions were allowed to do higher-paying version of the same HITs that paid $0. [sent-155, score-0.248]
</p><p>59 2  Data Statistics  Over a 2-month period we accepted 2,884 follower HITs and 810 instructor HITs from 653 workers. [sent-159, score-0.198]
</p><p>60 This corresponds to over 14,000 follower traces and 2,400 instructions with most of them consisting of single sentences. [sent-160, score-0.401]
</p><p>61 For instructions with multiple sentences, we merged all the sentences together and treated it as a single sentence. [sent-161, score-0.218]
</p><p>62 First, we discarded any instructions that did not have at least 5 follower traces. [sent-165, score-0.356]
</p><p>63 Then we looked at all the follower traces and discarded any instruction that did not have majority agreement on what the correct path is. [sent-166, score-0.334]
</p><p>64 Overall, the new corpus has a slightly smaller vocabulary, and each instruction is slightly shorter both in terms of the number of words and the number of actions. [sent-169, score-0.205]
</p><p>65 5 Experiments We evaluate our new lexicon learning algorithm as well as the other modifications to the navigation system using the same three tasks as Chen and Mooney (201 1). [sent-170, score-0.779]
</p><p>66 The first task is disambiguating the training data by inferring the correct navigation plans associated with each training sentence. [sent-171, score-0.739]
</p><p>67 The second task is evaluating the performance of the semantic parsers trained on the disambiguated data. [sent-172, score-0.167]
</p><p>68 Finally, the third task is to complete the end-to-end navigation task. [sent-174, score-0.511]
</p><p>69 There are two versions of this task, the complete task uses the original instructions which are several sentences long and the other version uses instructions that have been manually split into single sentences. [sent-175, score-0.436]
</p><p>70 For the first task, we build a lexicon using ambiguous training data from two maps, and then use the lexicon to produce the best disambiguated semantic meanings for those same data. [sent-178, score-0.677]
</p><p>71 For all comparisons to the Chen and Mooney results, we use the performance of their refined land-  marks plans system which performed the best overall. [sent-180, score-0.166]
</p><p>72 Moreover, it provides the most direct comparison to our approach since both use a lexicon to refine the landmarks plans. [sent-181, score-0.261]
</p><p>73 1 Inferring Navigation Plans First, we examine the quality of the refined navigation plans produced using SGOLL’s lexicon. [sent-185, score-0.677]
</p><p>74 13429 Table 2: Partial parse accuracy of how well each algorithm can infer the gold-standard navigation plans. [sent-189, score-0.558]
</p><p>75 13473  Table 3: Partial parse accuracy of the semantic parsers trained on the disambiguated navigation plans. [sent-193, score-0.678]
</p><p>76 precision, recall, and F1 (harmonic mean of precision and recall) of these plans are shown in Table 2. [sent-194, score-0.166]
</p><p>77 Compared to Chen and Mooney, the plans produced by SGOLL has higher precision and lower recall. [sent-195, score-0.166]
</p><p>78 2 Training Semantic Parsers Next we look at the performance of the semantic parsers trained on the inferred navigation plans. [sent-198, score-0.67]
</p><p>79 3 Executing Navigation Plans Finally, we evaluate the system on the end-to-end navigation task. [sent-204, score-0.511]
</p><p>80 SGOLL outperforms Chen and Mooney’s system on both versions of the navigation task. [sent-208, score-0.511]
</p><p>81 Finally, augmenting the  Table 4: End-to-end navigation task completion rates. [sent-210, score-0.548]
</p><p>82 training data with additional instructions and follower traces collected from Mechanical Turk produced the best results. [sent-214, score-0.47]
</p><p>83 The average time (in seconds) it takes for each algorithm to build a lexicon is shown in Table 5. [sent-217, score-0.239]
</p><p>84 Here SGOLL has a decidedly large advantage over the lexicon learning algorithm from Chen and Mooney, requiring an order of magnitude less time to run. [sent-220, score-0.3]
</p><p>85 This shows how inefficient it is to perform graph intersection operations and how our online algorithm can more realistically scale to large datasets. [sent-222, score-0.199]
</p><p>86 6 Discussion We have introduced a novel, online lexicon learning algorithm that is much faster than the one proposed by Chen and Mooney and also performs better on the navigation tasks they devised. [sent-244, score-0.854]
</p><p>87 Compared to systems that train on supervised semantic annotations, a system that only receives weak, ambiguous training data is expected to have to train on much larger datasets to achieve sim-  ilar performance. [sent-246, score-0.182]
</p><p>88 Moreover, the online nature of SGOLL allows the lexicon to be continually updated while the system is in use. [sent-249, score-0.235]
</p><p>89 A deployed navigation system can gather new instructions from the user and receive feedback about whether it is performing the correct actions. [sent-250, score-0.729]
</p><p>90 As new training examples are collected, we can update the corresponding n-gram and subgraph counts without rebuilding the entire lexicon. [sent-251, score-0.272]
</p><p>91 One thing to note though is that while SGOLL makes the lexicon learning step much faster and scalable, another bottleneck in the overall system is training the semantic parser. [sent-252, score-0.358]
</p><p>92 Parallel to the work of learning from ambiguous supervision, other recent work has also looked at training semantic parsers from supervision other than logical-form annotations. [sent-277, score-0.342]
</p><p>93 In this paper we presented a novel online algorithm for building a lexicon from ambiguously supervised relational data. [sent-286, score-0.282]
</p><p>94 In contrast to the previous approach that computed common subgraphs between different contexts in which an n-gram appeared, we instead focus on small, connected subgraphs and introduce an algorithm, SGOLL, that is an order of magnitude faster. [sent-287, score-0.367]
</p><p>95 In addition to being more scalable, SGOLL also performed better on the task of interpreting navigation instructions. [sent-288, score-0.511]
</p><p>96 In addition, we showed that changing the MRG and collecting additional training data from Mechanical Turk further improve the performance of the overall navigation system. [sent-289, score-0.62]
</p><p>97 Finally, we demonstrated the generality of the system by using it to learn Chinese navigation instructions and achieved similar results. [sent-290, score-0.764]

<p>Author: Luciana Benotti ; Martin Villalba ; Tessa Lau ; Julian Cerruti</p><p>Abstract: Previous approaches to instruction interpretation have required either extensive domain adaptation or manually annotated corpora. This paper presents a novel approach to instruction interpretation that leverages a large amount of unannotated, easy-to-collect data from humans interacting with a virtual world. We compare several algorithms for automatically segmenting and discretizing this data into (utterance, reaction) pairs and training a classifier to predict reactions given the next utterance. Our empirical analysis shows that the best algorithm achieves 70% accuracy on this task, with no manual annotation required. 1 Introduction and motivation Mapping instructions into automatically executable actions would enable the creation of natural lan- , guage interfaces to many applications (Lau et al., 2009; Branavan et al., 2009; Orkin and Roy, 2009). In this paper, we focus on the task of navigation and manipulation of a virtual environment (Vogel and Jurafsky, 2010; Chen and Mooney, 2011). Current symbolic approaches to the problem are brittle to the natural language variation present in instructions and require intensive rule authoring to be fit for a new task (Dzikovska et al., 2008). Current statistical approaches require extensive manual annotations of the corpora used for training (MacMahon et al., 2006; Matuszek et al., 2010; Gorniak and Roy, 2007; Rieser and Lemon, 2010). Manual annotation and rule authoring by natural language engineering experts are bottlenecks for developing conversational systems for new domains. 181 t e s s al au @ us . ibm . com, j ce rrut i ar .ibm . com @ This paper proposes a fully automated approach to interpreting natural language instructions to complete a task in a virtual world based on unsupervised recordings of human-human interactions perform- ing that task in that virtual world. Given unannotated corpora collected from humans following other humans’ instructions, our system automatically segments the corpus into labeled training data for a classification algorithm. Our interpretation algorithm is based on the observation that similar instructions uttered in similar contexts should lead to similar actions being taken in the virtual world. Given a previously unseen instruction, our system outputs actions that can be directly executed in the virtual world, based on what humans did when given similar instructions in the past. 2 Corpora situated in virtual worlds Our environment consists of six virtual worlds designed for the natural language generation shared task known as the GIVE Challenge (Koller et al., 2010), where a pair of partners must collaborate to solve a task in a 3D space (Figure 1). The “instruction follower” (IF) can move around in the virtual world, but has no knowledge of the task. The “instruction giver” (IG) types instructions to the IF in order to guide him to accomplish the task. Each corpus contains the IF’s actions and position recorded every 200 milliseconds, as well as the IG’s instruc- tions with their timestamps. We used two corpora for our experiments. The Cm corpus (Gargett et al., 2010) contains instructions given by multiple people, consisting of 37 games spanning 2163 instructions over 8: 17 hs.

The world consists of interconnecting hallways, rooms and objects Cs corpus (Benotti and Denis, 2011), gathered using a single IG, is composed of 63 games and 3417 in- structions, and was recorded in a span of 6:09 hs. It took less than 15 hours to collect the corpora through the web and the subjects reported that the experiment was fun. While the environment is restricted, people describe the same route and the same objects in extremely different ways. Below are some examples of instructions from our corpus all given for the same route shown in Figure 1. 1) out 2) walk down the passage 3) nowgo [sic] to the pink room 4) back to the room with the plant 5) Go through the door on the left 6) go through opening with yellow wall paper People describe routes using landmarks (4) or specific actions (2). They may describe the same object differently (5 vs 6). Instructions also differ in their scope (3 vs 1). Thus, even ignoring spelling and grammatical errors, navigation instructions contain considerable variation which makes interpreting them a challenging problem. 3 Learning from previous interpretations Our algorithm consists of two phases: annotation and interpretation. Annotation is performed only once and consists of automatically associating each IG instruction to an IF reaction. Interpretation is performed every time the system receives an instruc182 tion and consists of predicting an appropriate reaction given reactions observed in the corpus. Our method is based on the assumption that a reaction captures the semantics of the instruction that caused it. Therefore, if two utterances result in the same reaction, they are paraphrases of each other, and similar utterances should generate the same reaction. This approach enables us to predict reactions for previously-unseen instructions. 3.1 Annotation phase The key challenge in learning from massive amounts of easily-collected data is to automatically annotate an unannotated corpus. Our annotation method consists of two parts: first, segmenting a low-level interaction trace into utterances and corresponding reactions, and second, discretizing those reactions into canonical action sequences. Segmentation enables our algorithm to learn from traces of IFs interacting directly with a virtual world. Since the IF can move freely in the virtual world, his actions are a stream of continuous behavior. Segmentation divides these traces into reactions that follow from each utterance of the IG. Consider the following example starting at the situation shown in Figure 1: IG(1): go through the yellow opening IF(2): [walks out of the room] IF(3): [turns left at the intersection] IF(4): [enters the room with the sofa] IG(5): stop It is not clear whether the IF is doing h3, 4i because h neo tis c reacting htoe r1 t or Fbec isadu soei hge h 3is, being proactive. While one could manually annotate this data to remove extraneous actions, our goal is to develop automated solutions that enable learning from massive amounts of data. We decided to approach this problem by experimenting with two alternative formal definitions: 1) a strict definition that considers the maximum reaction according to the IF behavior, and 2) a loose defini- tion based on the empirical observation that, in situated interaction, most instructions are constrained by the current visually perceived affordances (Gibson, 1979; Stoia et al., 2006). We formally define behavior segmentation (Bhv) as follows. A reaction rk to an instruction uk begins right after the instruction uk is uttered and ends right before the next instruction uk+1 is uttered. In the example, instruction 1corresponds to h2, 3, 4i . We formally d inefsitnrue visibility segmentation (Vis) as f Wolelows. A reaction rk to an instruction uk begins right after the instruction uk is uttered and ends right before the next instruction uk+1 is uttered or right after the IF leaves the area visible at 360◦ from where uk was uttered. In the example, instruction 1’s reaction would be limited to h2i because the intersection is nwootu vldisi bbele l ifmroimte dw htoer he2 tihe b eicnasutrsuec ttihoen was suetctetiroend. The Bhv and Vis methods define how to segment an interaction trace into utterances and their corresponding reactions. However, users frequently perform noisy behavior that is irrelevant to the goal of the task. For example, after hearing an instruction, an IF might go into the wrong room, realize the error, and leave the room. A reaction should not in- clude such irrelevant actions. In addition, IFs may accomplish the same goal using different behaviors: two different IFs may interpret “go to the pink room” by following different paths to the same destination. We would like to be able to generalize both reactions into one canonical reaction. As a result, our approach discretizes reactions into higher-level action sequences with less noise and less variation. Our discretization algorithm uses an automated planner and a planning representation of the task. This planning representation includes: (1) the task goal, (2) the actions which can be taken in the virtual world, and (3) the current state of the virtual world. Using the planning representation, the planner calculates an optimal path between the starting and ending states of the reaction, eliminating all unnecessary actions. While we use the classical planner FF (Hoffmann, 2003), our technique could also work with classical planning (Nau et al., 2004) or other techniques such as probabilistic planning (Bonet and Geffner, 2005). It is also not dependent on a particular discretization of the world in terms of actions. Now we are ready to define canonical reaction ck formally. Let Sk be the state of the virtual world when instruction uk was uttered, Sk+1 be the state of the world where the reaction ends (as defined by Bhv or Vis segmentation), and D be the planning domain representation of the virtual world. The canonical reaction to uk is defined as the sequence of actions 183 returned by the planner with Sk as initial state, Sk+1 as goal state and D as planning domain. 3.2 Interpretation phase The annotation phase results in a collection of (uk, ck) pairs. The interpretation phase uses these pairs to interpret new utterances in three steps. First, we filter the set of pairs into those whose reactions can be directly executed from the current IF position. Second, we group the filtered pairs according to their reactions. Third, we select the group with utterances most similar to the new utterance, and output that group’s reaction. Figure 2 shows the output of the first two steps: three groups of pairs whose reactions can all be executed from the IF’s current position. Figure 2: Utterance groups for this situation. Colored arrows show the reaction associated with each group. We treat the third step, selecting the most similar group for a new utterance, as a classification problem. We compare three different classification methods. One method uses nearest-neighbor classification with three different similarity metrics: Jaccard and Overlap coefficients (both of which measure the degree of overlap between two sets, differing only in the normalization of the final value (Nikravesh et al., 2005)), and Levenshtein Distance (a string met- ric for measuring the amount of differences between two sequences of words (Levenshtein, 1966)). Our second classification method employs a strategy in which we considered each group as a set of possible machine translations of our utterance, using the BLEU measure (Papineni et al., 2002) to select which group could be considered the best translation of our utterance. Finally, we trained an SVM classifier (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) using the unigrams Corpus Cm Corpus Cs Algorithm Bhv Vis Bhv Vis Jaccard47%54%54%70% Overlap BLEU SVM Levenshtein 43% 44% 33% 21% 53% 52% 29% 20% 45% 54% 45% 8% 60% 50% 29% 17% Table 1: Accuracy comparison between Cm and Cs for Bhv and Vis segmentation of each paraphrase and the position of the IF as features, and setting their group as the output class using a libSVM wrapper (Chang and Lin, 2011). When the system misinterprets an instruction we use a similar approach to what people do in order to overcome misunderstandings. If the system executes an incorrect reaction, the IG can tell the system to cancel its current interpretation and try again using a paraphrase, selecting a different reaction. 4 Evaluation For the evaluation phase, we annotated both the Cm and Cs corpora entirely, and then we split them in an 80/20 proportion; the first 80% of data collected in each virtual world was used for training, while the remaining 20% was used for testing. For each pair (uk, ck) in the testing set, we used our algorithm to predict the reaction to the selected utterance, and then compared this result against the automatically annotated reaction. Table 1 shows the results. Comparing the Bhv and Vis segmentation strategies, Vis tends to obtain better results than Bhv. In addition, accuracy on the Cs corpus was generally higher than Cm. Given that Cs contained only one IG, we believe this led to less variability in the instructions and less noise in the training data. We evaluated the impact of user corrections by simulating them using the existing corpus. In case of a wrong response, the algorithm receives a second utterance with the same reaction (a paraphrase of the previous one). Then the new utterance is tested over the same set of possible groups, except for the one which was returned before. If the correct reaction is not predicted after four tries, or there are no utterances with the same reaction, the predictions are registered as wrong. To measure the effects of user corrections vs. without, we used a different evalu184 ation process for this algorithm: first, we split the corpus in a 50/50 proportion, and then we moved correctly predicted utterances from the testing set towards training, until either there was nothing more to learn or the training set reached 80% of the entire corpus size. As expected, user corrections significantly improve accuracy, as shown in Figure 3. The worst algorithm’s results improve linearly with each try, while the best ones behave asymptotically, barely improving after the second try. The best algorithm reaches 92% with just one correction from the IG. 5 Discussion and future work We presented an approach to instruction interpretation which learns from non-annotated logs of human behavior. Our empirical analysis shows that our best algorithm achieves 70% accuracy on this task, with no manual annotation required. When corrections are added, accuracy goes up to 92% for just one correction. We consider our results promising since state of the art semi-unsupervised approaches to instruction interpretation (Chen and Mooney, 2011) reports a 55% accuracy on manually segmented data. We plan to compare our system’s performance against human performance in comparable situations. Our informal observations of the GIVE corpus indicate that humans often follow instructions incorrectly, so our automated system’s performance may be on par with human performance. Although we have presented our approach in the context of 3D virtual worlds, we believe our technique is also applicable to other domains such as the web, video games, or Human Robot Interaction.

<p>Author: Gregory Druck ; Bo Pang</p><p>Abstract: There are a growing number of popular web sites where users submit and review instructions for completing tasks as varied as building a table and baking a pie. In addition to providing their subjective evaluation, reviewers often provide actionable refinements. These refinements clarify, correct, improve, or provide alternatives to the original instructions. However, identifying and reading all relevant reviews is a daunting task for a user. In this paper, we propose a generative model that jointly identifies user-proposed refinements in instruction reviews at multiple granularities, and aligns them to the appropriate steps in the original instructions. Labeled data is not readily available for these tasks, so we focus on the unsupervised setting. In experiments in the recipe domain, our model provides 90. 1% F1 for predicting refinements at the review level, and 77.0% F1 for predicting refinement segments within reviews.</p><p>5 0.08440394 <a title="93-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Maximum_Expected_BLEU_Training_of_Phrase_and_Lexicon_Translation_Models.html">141 acl-2012-Maximum Expected BLEU Training of Phrase and Lexicon Translation Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaodong He ; Li Deng</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new discriminative training method in constructing phrase and lexicon translation models. In order to reliably learn a myriad of parameters in these models, we propose an expected BLEU score-based utility function with KL regularization as the objective, and train the models on a large parallel dataset. For training, we derive growth transformations for phrase and lexicon translation probabilities to iteratively improve the objective. The proposed method, evaluated on the Europarl German-to-English dataset, leads to a 1.1 BLEU point improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline translation system. In IWSLT 201 1 Benchmark, our system using the proposed method achieves the best Chinese-to-English translation result on the task of translating TED talks.</p><p>6 0.080332182 <a title="93-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Improving_Word_Representations_via_Global_Context_and_Multiple_Word_Prototypes.html">117 acl-2012-Improving Word Representations via Global Context and Multiple Word Prototypes</a></p>

<p>Author: David Chen</p><p>Abstract: Learning a semantic lexicon is often an important first step in building a system that learns to interpret the meaning of natural language. It is especially important in language grounding where the training data usually consist of language paired with an ambiguous perceptual context. Recent work by Chen and Mooney (201 1) introduced a lexicon learning method that deals with ambiguous relational data by taking intersections of graphs. While the algorithm produced good lexicons for the task of learning to interpret navigation instructions, it only works in batch settings and does not scale well to large datasets. In this paper we introduce a new online algorithm that is an order of magnitude faster and surpasses the stateof-the-art results. We show that by changing the grammar of the formal meaning represen- . tation language and training on additional data collected from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk we can further improve the results. We also include experimental results on a Chinese translation of the training data to demonstrate the generality of our approach.</p><p>2 0.87508595 <a title="93-lsi-2" href="./acl-2012-A_Web-based_Evaluation_Framework_for_Spatial_Instruction-Giving_Systems.html">24 acl-2012-A Web-based Evaluation Framework for Spatial Instruction-Giving Systems</a></p>

<p>Author: Luciana Benotti ; Martin Villalba ; Tessa Lau ; Julian Cerruti</p><p>Abstract: Previous approaches to instruction interpretation have required either extensive domain adaptation or manually annotated corpora. This paper presents a novel approach to instruction interpretation that leverages a large amount of unannotated, easy-to-collect data from humans interacting with a virtual world. We compare several algorithms for automatically segmenting and discretizing this data into (utterance, reaction) pairs and training a classifier to predict reactions given the next utterance. Our empirical analysis shows that the best algorithm achieves 70% accuracy on this task, with no manual annotation required. 1 Introduction and motivation Mapping instructions into automatically executable actions would enable the creation of natural lan- , guage interfaces to many applications (Lau et al., 2009; Branavan et al., 2009; Orkin and Roy, 2009). In this paper, we focus on the task of navigation and manipulation of a virtual environment (Vogel and Jurafsky, 2010; Chen and Mooney, 2011). Current symbolic approaches to the problem are brittle to the natural language variation present in instructions and require intensive rule authoring to be fit for a new task (Dzikovska et al., 2008). Current statistical approaches require extensive manual annotations of the corpora used for training (MacMahon et al., 2006; Matuszek et al., 2010; Gorniak and Roy, 2007; Rieser and Lemon, 2010). Manual annotation and rule authoring by natural language engineering experts are bottlenecks for developing conversational systems for new domains. 181 t e s s al au @ us . ibm . com, j ce rrut i ar .ibm . com @ This paper proposes a fully automated approach to interpreting natural language instructions to complete a task in a virtual world based on unsupervised recordings of human-human interactions perform- ing that task in that virtual world. Given unannotated corpora collected from humans following other humans’ instructions, our system automatically segments the corpus into labeled training data for a classification algorithm. Our interpretation algorithm is based on the observation that similar instructions uttered in similar contexts should lead to similar actions being taken in the virtual world. Given a previously unseen instruction, our system outputs actions that can be directly executed in the virtual world, based on what humans did when given similar instructions in the past. 2 Corpora situated in virtual worlds Our environment consists of six virtual worlds designed for the natural language generation shared task known as the GIVE Challenge (Koller et al., 2010), where a pair of partners must collaborate to solve a task in a 3D space (Figure 1). The “instruction follower” (IF) can move around in the virtual world, but has no knowledge of the task. The “instruction giver” (IG) types instructions to the IF in order to guide him to accomplish the task. Each corpus contains the IF’s actions and position recorded every 200 milliseconds, as well as the IG’s instruc- tions with their timestamps. We used two corpora for our experiments. The Cm corpus (Gargett et al., 2010) contains instructions given by multiple people, consisting of 37 games spanning 2163 instructions over 8: 17 hs.

The world consists of interconnecting hallways, rooms and objects Cs corpus (Benotti and Denis, 2011), gathered using a single IG, is composed of 63 games and 3417 in- structions, and was recorded in a span of 6:09 hs. It took less than 15 hours to collect the corpora through the web and the subjects reported that the experiment was fun. While the environment is restricted, people describe the same route and the same objects in extremely different ways. Below are some examples of instructions from our corpus all given for the same route shown in Figure 1. 1) out 2) walk down the passage 3) nowgo [sic] to the pink room 4) back to the room with the plant 5) Go through the door on the left 6) go through opening with yellow wall paper People describe routes using landmarks (4) or specific actions (2). They may describe the same object differently (5 vs 6). Instructions also differ in their scope (3 vs 1). Thus, even ignoring spelling and grammatical errors, navigation instructions contain considerable variation which makes interpreting them a challenging problem. 3 Learning from previous interpretations Our algorithm consists of two phases: annotation and interpretation. Annotation is performed only once and consists of automatically associating each IG instruction to an IF reaction. Interpretation is performed every time the system receives an instruc182 tion and consists of predicting an appropriate reaction given reactions observed in the corpus. Our method is based on the assumption that a reaction captures the semantics of the instruction that caused it. Therefore, if two utterances result in the same reaction, they are paraphrases of each other, and similar utterances should generate the same reaction. This approach enables us to predict reactions for previously-unseen instructions. 3.1 Annotation phase The key challenge in learning from massive amounts of easily-collected data is to automatically annotate an unannotated corpus. Our annotation method consists of two parts: first, segmenting a low-level interaction trace into utterances and corresponding reactions, and second, discretizing those reactions into canonical action sequences. Segmentation enables our algorithm to learn from traces of IFs interacting directly with a virtual world. Since the IF can move freely in the virtual world, his actions are a stream of continuous behavior. Segmentation divides these traces into reactions that follow from each utterance of the IG. Consider the following example starting at the situation shown in Figure 1: IG(1): go through the yellow opening IF(2): [walks out of the room] IF(3): [turns left at the intersection] IF(4): [enters the room with the sofa] IG(5): stop It is not clear whether the IF is doing h3, 4i because h neo tis c reacting htoe r1 t or Fbec isadu soei hge h 3is, being proactive. While one could manually annotate this data to remove extraneous actions, our goal is to develop automated solutions that enable learning from massive amounts of data. We decided to approach this problem by experimenting with two alternative formal definitions: 1) a strict definition that considers the maximum reaction according to the IF behavior, and 2) a loose defini- tion based on the empirical observation that, in situated interaction, most instructions are constrained by the current visually perceived affordances (Gibson, 1979; Stoia et al., 2006). We formally define behavior segmentation (Bhv) as follows. A reaction rk to an instruction uk begins right after the instruction uk is uttered and ends right before the next instruction uk+1 is uttered. In the example, instruction 1corresponds to h2, 3, 4i . We formally d inefsitnrue visibility segmentation (Vis) as f Wolelows. A reaction rk to an instruction uk begins right after the instruction uk is uttered and ends right before the next instruction uk+1 is uttered or right after the IF leaves the area visible at 360◦ from where uk was uttered. In the example, instruction 1’s reaction would be limited to h2i because the intersection is nwootu vldisi bbele l ifmroimte dw htoer he2 tihe b eicnasutrsuec ttihoen was suetctetiroend. The Bhv and Vis methods define how to segment an interaction trace into utterances and their corresponding reactions. However, users frequently perform noisy behavior that is irrelevant to the goal of the task. For example, after hearing an instruction, an IF might go into the wrong room, realize the error, and leave the room. A reaction should not in- clude such irrelevant actions. In addition, IFs may accomplish the same goal using different behaviors: two different IFs may interpret “go to the pink room” by following different paths to the same destination. We would like to be able to generalize both reactions into one canonical reaction. As a result, our approach discretizes reactions into higher-level action sequences with less noise and less variation. Our discretization algorithm uses an automated planner and a planning representation of the task. This planning representation includes: (1) the task goal, (2) the actions which can be taken in the virtual world, and (3) the current state of the virtual world. Using the planning representation, the planner calculates an optimal path between the starting and ending states of the reaction, eliminating all unnecessary actions. While we use the classical planner FF (Hoffmann, 2003), our technique could also work with classical planning (Nau et al., 2004) or other techniques such as probabilistic planning (Bonet and Geffner, 2005). It is also not dependent on a particular discretization of the world in terms of actions. Now we are ready to define canonical reaction ck formally. Let Sk be the state of the virtual world when instruction uk was uttered, Sk+1 be the state of the world where the reaction ends (as defined by Bhv or Vis segmentation), and D be the planning domain representation of the virtual world. The canonical reaction to uk is defined as the sequence of actions 183 returned by the planner with Sk as initial state, Sk+1 as goal state and D as planning domain. 3.2 Interpretation phase The annotation phase results in a collection of (uk, ck) pairs. The interpretation phase uses these pairs to interpret new utterances in three steps. First, we filter the set of pairs into those whose reactions can be directly executed from the current IF position. Second, we group the filtered pairs according to their reactions. Third, we select the group with utterances most similar to the new utterance, and output that group’s reaction. Figure 2 shows the output of the first two steps: three groups of pairs whose reactions can all be executed from the IF’s current position. Figure 2: Utterance groups for this situation. Colored arrows show the reaction associated with each group. We treat the third step, selecting the most similar group for a new utterance, as a classification problem. We compare three different classification methods. One method uses nearest-neighbor classification with three different similarity metrics: Jaccard and Overlap coefficients (both of which measure the degree of overlap between two sets, differing only in the normalization of the final value (Nikravesh et al., 2005)), and Levenshtein Distance (a string met- ric for measuring the amount of differences between two sequences of words (Levenshtein, 1966)). Our second classification method employs a strategy in which we considered each group as a set of possible machine translations of our utterance, using the BLEU measure (Papineni et al., 2002) to select which group could be considered the best translation of our utterance. Finally, we trained an SVM classifier (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) using the unigrams Corpus Cm Corpus Cs Algorithm Bhv Vis Bhv Vis Jaccard47%54%54%70% Overlap BLEU SVM Levenshtein 43% 44% 33% 21% 53% 52% 29% 20% 45% 54% 45% 8% 60% 50% 29% 17% Table 1: Accuracy comparison between Cm and Cs for Bhv and Vis segmentation of each paraphrase and the position of the IF as features, and setting their group as the output class using a libSVM wrapper (Chang and Lin, 2011). When the system misinterprets an instruction we use a similar approach to what people do in order to overcome misunderstandings. If the system executes an incorrect reaction, the IG can tell the system to cancel its current interpretation and try again using a paraphrase, selecting a different reaction. 4 Evaluation For the evaluation phase, we annotated both the Cm and Cs corpora entirely, and then we split them in an 80/20 proportion; the first 80% of data collected in each virtual world was used for training, while the remaining 20% was used for testing. For each pair (uk, ck) in the testing set, we used our algorithm to predict the reaction to the selected utterance, and then compared this result against the automatically annotated reaction. Table 1 shows the results. Comparing the Bhv and Vis segmentation strategies, Vis tends to obtain better results than Bhv. In addition, accuracy on the Cs corpus was generally higher than Cm. Given that Cs contained only one IG, we believe this led to less variability in the instructions and less noise in the training data. We evaluated the impact of user corrections by simulating them using the existing corpus. In case of a wrong response, the algorithm receives a second utterance with the same reaction (a paraphrase of the previous one). Then the new utterance is tested over the same set of possible groups, except for the one which was returned before. If the correct reaction is not predicted after four tries, or there are no utterances with the same reaction, the predictions are registered as wrong. To measure the effects of user corrections vs. without, we used a different evalu184 ation process for this algorithm: first, we split the corpus in a 50/50 proportion, and then we moved correctly predicted utterances from the testing set towards training, until either there was nothing more to learn or the training set reached 80% of the entire corpus size. As expected, user corrections significantly improve accuracy, as shown in Figure 3. The worst algorithm’s results improve linearly with each try, while the best ones behave asymptotically, barely improving after the second try. The best algorithm reaches 92% with just one correction from the IG. 5 Discussion and future work We presented an approach to instruction interpretation which learns from non-annotated logs of human behavior. Our empirical analysis shows that our best algorithm achieves 70% accuracy on this task, with no manual annotation required. When corrections are added, accuracy goes up to 92% for just one correction. We consider our results promising since state of the art semi-unsupervised approaches to instruction interpretation (Chen and Mooney, 2011) reports a 55% accuracy on manually segmented data. We plan to compare our system’s performance against human performance in comparable situations. Our informal observations of the GIVE corpus indicate that humans often follow instructions incorrectly, so our automated system’s performance may be on par with human performance. Although we have presented our approach in the context of 3D virtual worlds, we believe our technique is also applicable to other domains such as the web, video games, or Human Robot Interaction.

<p>Author: S.R.K. Branavan ; Nate Kushman ; Tao Lei ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: Comprehending action preconditions and effects is an essential step in modeling the dynamics of the world. In this paper, we express the semantics of precondition relations extracted from text in terms of planning operations. The challenge of modeling this connection is to ground language at the level of relations. This type of grounding enables us to create high-level plans based on language abstractions. Our model jointly learns to predict precondition relations from text and to perform high-level planning guided by those relations. We implement this idea in the reinforcement learning framework using feedback automatically obtained from plan execution attempts. When applied to a complex virtual world and text describing that world, our relation extraction technique performs on par with a supervised baseline, yielding an F-measure of 66% compared to the baseline’s 65%. Additionally, we show that a high-level planner utilizing these extracted relations significantly outperforms a strong, text unaware baseline successfully completing 80% of planning tasks as compared to 69% for the baseline.1 –</p><p>5 0.30106735 <a title="93-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-Qualitative_Modeling_of_Spatial_Prepositions_and_Motion_Expressions.html">166 acl-2012-Qualitative Modeling of Spatial Prepositions and Motion Expressions</a></p>

<p>Author: Preethi Raghavan ; Albert Lai ; Eric Fosler-Lussier</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of ordering medical events in unstructured clinical narratives by learning to rank them based on their time of occurrence. We represent each medical event as a time duration, with a corresponding start and stop, and learn to rank the starts/stops based on their proximity to the admission date. Such a representation allows us to learn all of Allen’s temporal relations between medical events. Interestingly, we observe that this methodology performs better than a classification-based approach for this domain, but worse on the relationships found in the Timebank corpus. This finding has important implications for styles of data representation and resources used for temporal relation learning: clinical narratives may have different language attributes corresponding to temporal ordering relative to Timebank, implying that the field may need to look at a wider range ofdomains to fully understand the nature of temporal ordering.</p><p>same-paper 5 0.84113789 <a title="93-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Fast_Online_Lexicon_Learning_for_Grounded_Language_Acquisition.html">93 acl-2012-Fast Online Lexicon Learning for Grounded Language Acquisition</a></p>
<p>Author: David Chen</p><p>Abstract: Learning a semantic lexicon is often an important first step in building a system that learns to interpret the meaning of natural language. It is especially important in language grounding where the training data usually consist of language paired with an ambiguous perceptual context. Recent work by Chen and Mooney (201 1) introduced a lexicon learning method that deals with ambiguous relational data by taking intersections of graphs. While the algorithm produced good lexicons for the task of learning to interpret navigation instructions, it only works in batch settings and does not scale well to large datasets. In this paper we introduce a new online algorithm that is an order of magnitude faster and surpasses the stateof-the-art results. We show that by changing the grammar of the formal meaning represen- . tation language and training on additional data collected from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk we can further improve the results. We also include experimental results on a Chinese translation of the training data to demonstrate the generality of our approach.</p><p>6 0.5071314 <a title="93-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-langid.py%3A_An_Off-the-shelf_Language_Identification_Tool.html">219 acl-2012-langid.py: An Off-the-shelf Language Identification Tool</a></p>

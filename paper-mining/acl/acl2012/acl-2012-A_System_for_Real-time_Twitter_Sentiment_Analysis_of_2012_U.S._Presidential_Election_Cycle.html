</p><p>4 In addition, sentiment analysis can help explore how these events affect public opinion. [sent-10, score-0.681]
</p><p>5 While traditional content analysis takes days or weeks to complete, the system demonstrated here analyzes sentiment in the entire Twitter traffic about  the election, delivering results instantly and continuously. [sent-11, score-0.612]
</p><p>6 It offers the public, the media, politicians and scholars a new and timely perspective on the dynamics of the electoral process and public opinion. [sent-12, score-0.2]
</p><p>7 1  Introduction  Social media platforms have become an important site for political conversations throughout the world. [sent-13, score-0.265]
</p><p>8 With this analysis, we seek to explore whether Twitter provides insights into the unfolding of the campaigns and indications of shifts in public opinion. [sent-15, score-0.202]
</p><p>9 Twitter allows users to post tweets, messages of up to 140 characters, on its social network. [sent-16, score-0.137]
</p><p>10 The company reports  over 100 million active users worldwide, together sending over 250 million tweets each day (Twitter, 2012). [sent-18, score-0.568]
</p><p>11 It was actively used by 13% of on-line American adults as of May 201 1, up from 8% a year prior (Pew Research Center, 201 1). [sent-19, score-0.098]
</p><p>12 congress members have created a Twitter account and many are actively using Twitter to reach their constituents (Lassen & Brown, 2010; TweetCongress, 2012). [sent-22, score-0.092]
</p><p>13 Since October 12, 2012, we have gathered over 36 million tweets about the 2012 U. [sent-23, score-0.448]
</p><p>14 presidential candidates, a quarter million per day on average. [sent-25, score-0.253]
</p><p>15 During one of the key political events, the Dec 15, 201 1 primary debate in Iowa, we collected more than half a million relevant tweets in just a few hours. [sent-26, score-0.789]
</p><p>16 This kind of ‘big data’ vastly outpaces the capacity of traditional content analysis approaches, calling for novel computational approaches. [sent-27, score-0.036]
</p><p>17 Most work to date has focused on post-facto analysis of tweets, with results coming days or even months after the collection time. [sent-28, score-0.073]
</p><p>18 The system architecture for real-time processing Twitter data  because tweets are short and easy to send, they lend themselves to quick and dynamic expression of instant reactions to current events. [sent-34, score-0.434]
</p><p>19 We expect automated real-time sentiment analysis of this user-generated data can provide fast indications of changes in opinion, showing for example how an audience reacts to particular candidate’s statements during a political debate. [sent-35, score-0.706]
</p><p>20 The system we present here, along with the dashboards displaying analysis results with drill-down ability, is precisely aimed at generating real-time insights as events unfold. [sent-36, score-0.224]
</p><p>21 First, the vernacular used on Twitter differs significantly from common language and we have trained our sentiment model on its idiosyncrasies. [sent-38, score-0.405]
</p><p>22 Second, tweets in general, and political tweets in particular, tend to be quite sarcastic, presenting significant challenges for computer models (González-Ibáñez et al. [sent-39, score-1.025]
</p><p>23 Here, we focus on presenting the overall system and the visualization dashboards we have built. [sent-42, score-0.108]
</p><p>24 2  Related Work  In the last decade, interest in mining sentiment and opinions in text has grown rapidly, due in part to the large increase of the availability of documents and messages expressing personal opinions (Pang & Lee, 2008). [sent-44, score-0.5]
</p><p>25 In particular, sentiment in Twitter data has been used for prediction or measurement in a variety of domains, such as stock market, politics and social movements (Bollen et al. [sent-45, score-0.499]
</p><p>26 For example, Tumasjan (2010) found tweet volume about the political parties to be a good predictor for the outcome of the 2009 German  election, while Choy et al. [sent-49, score-0.507]
</p><p>27 (201 1) failed to predict with Twitter sentiment the ranking of the four candidates in Singapore’s 2011 presidential election. [sent-50, score-0.637]
</p><p>28 Past studies of political sentiment on social networks have been either post-hoc and/or carried out on small and static samples. [sent-51, score-0.693]
</p><p>29 To address these issues, we built a unique infrastructure and sentiment model to analyze in real-time public sentiment on Twitter toward the 2012 U. [sent-52, score-1.033]
</p><p>30 3  The System  For accuracy and speed, we built our real-time data processing infrastructure on the IBM’s InfoSphere Streams platform (IBM, 2012), which enables us to write our own analysis and visualization modules and assemble them into a real-time processing pipeline. [sent-56, score-0.147]
</p><p>31 Streams applications are highly scalable  so we can adjust our system to handle higher volume of data by adding more servers and by distributing processing tasks. [sent-57, score-0.134]
</p><p>32 televised debates or primary election days) and stays low between events, making high scalability strongly desirable. [sent-60, score-0.29]
</p><p>33 Figure 1 shows our system’s architecture and its modules. [sent-61, score-0.034]
</p><p>34 1 Input/Data Source We chose the micro-blogging service Twitter as our data source because it is a major source of online political commentary and discussion in the U. [sent-64, score-0.258]
</p><p>35 People comment on and discuss politics by posting messages and ‘re-tweeting’ others’ messages. [sent-66, score-0.066]
</p><p>36 It played a significant role in political events worldwide, such as the Arab Spring Movement and the Moldovian protests in 2009. [sent-67, score-0.335]
</p><p>37 In response to events, Twitter volume goes up sharply and significantly. [sent-68, score-0.063]
</p><p>38 For example, during a republican debate, we receive several hundred thousand to a million tweets in just a few hours for all the candidates combined. [sent-69, score-0.6]
</p><p>39 Twitter’s public API provides only 1% or less of its entire traffic (the “firehose”), without control  over the sampling procedure, which is likely insufficient for accurate analysis of public sentiment. [sent-70, score-0.393]
</p><p>40 Instead, we collect all relevant tweets in real-time from the entire Twitter traffic via Gnip Power Track, a commercial Twitter data provider. [sent-71, score-0.497]
</p><p>41 To cope with this challenge during the later stages of the campaign, when larger Twitter traffic is expected, our system can handle huge traffic bursts over short time periods by distributing the processing to more servers, even though most of the times its processing load is minimal. [sent-72, score-0.231]
</p><p>42 Since our application targets the political domain (specifically the current Presidential election cycle), we manually construct rules that are simple logical keyword combinations to retrieve relevant tweets – those about candidates and events (including common typos in candidate names). [sent-73, score-1.014]
</p><p>43 Our system is tracking the tweets for nine Republican candidates (some of whom have suspended their campaign) and Barack Obama using about 200 rules in total. [sent-75, score-0.46]
</p><p>44 2  Preprocessing  The text of tweets differs from the text in articles, books, or even spoken language. [sent-77, score-0.4]
</p><p>45 , 2010) and found Christopher Potts’ basic Twitter tokenizer best suited as our base. [sent-83, score-0.031]
</p><p>46 In summary, our tokenizer correctly handles URLs, common emoticons, phone numbers, HTML tags, twitter mentions and hashtags, numbers with fractions and decimals, repetition of symbols and Unicode characters (see Figure 2 for an example). [sent-84, score-0.447]
</p><p>47 3  Sentiment Model  The design of the sentiment model used in our system was based on the assumption that the opinions expressed would be highly subjective and contextualized. [sent-86, score-0.435]
</p><p>48 Therefore, for generating data for model training and testing, we used a crowd-  sourcing approach to do sentiment annotation on in-domain political data. [sent-87, score-0.665]
</p><p>49 To create a baseline sentiment model, we used Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to get as varied a population of annotators as possible. [sent-88, score-0.405]
</p><p>50 We designed an interface that allowed annotators to perform the annotations outside of AMT so that they could participate anonymously. [sent-89, score-0.059]
</p><p>51 The Turkers were asked their age, gender, and to describe their political orientation. [sent-90, score-0.225]
</p><p>52 Our sentiment model is based on the sentiment label and the sarcasm and humor labels. [sent-92, score-0.85]
</p><p>53 Our training data consists of nearly 17000 tweets (16% positive, 56% negative, 18% neutral, 10% unsure), including nearly 2000 that were multiply annotated  Towke ntsWM hAit cpAhi:A/g aH! [sent-93, score-0.4]
</p><p>54 The statistical classifier we use for sentiment analysis is a naïve Bayes model on unigram features. [sent-100, score-0.441]
</p><p>55 Our features are calculated from tokenization of the tweets that attempts to preserve punctuation that may signify sentiment (e. [sent-101, score-0.805]
</p><p>56 , emoticons and exclamation points) as well as twitter specific phenomena (e. [sent-103, score-0.471]
</p><p>57 These results exceed the baseline of classifying all the data as negative, the most prevalent sentiment category (56%). [sent-107, score-0.405]
</p><p>58 The choice of our model was not strictly motivated by global accuracy, but took into account class-wise performance so that the model performed well on  each sentiment category. [sent-108, score-0.405]
</p><p>59 4 Aggregation Because our system receives tweets continuously and uses multiple rules to track each candidate’s tweets, our display must aggregate sentiment and tweet volume within each time period for each candidate. [sent-110, score-1.111]
</p><p>60 For volume, the system outputs the number of tweets every minute for each candidate. [sent-111, score-0.462]
</p><p>61 For sentiment, the system outputs the number of positive, negative, neutral and unsure tweets in a sliding five-minute window. [sent-112, score-0.551]
</p><p>62 5  Display and Visualization  We designed an Ajax-based  HTML dashboard  118 (Figure 3) to display volume and sentiment by candidate as well as trending words and system statistics. [sent-114, score-0.742]
</p><p>63 The dashboard pulls updated data from a web server and refreshes its display every 30 seconds. [sent-115, score-0.179]
</p><p>64 In Figure 3, the top-left bar graph shows the number of positive and negative tweets about each candidate (right and left bars, respectively) in the last five minutes as an indicator of sentiment towards the candidates. [sent-116, score-1.053]
</p><p>65 We chose to display both  positive and negative sentiment, instead of the difference between these two, because events typically trigger sharp variations in both positive and negative tweet volume. [sent-117, score-0.629]
</p><p>66 The top-right chart displays the number of tweets for each candidate every minute in the last two hours. [sent-118, score-0.496]
</p><p>67 We chose this time window because a live-broadcast primary debate usually lasts about two hours. [sent-119, score-0.116]
</p><p>68 The dashboard gives a synthetic overview of volume and sentiment for the candidates, but it is often desirable to view selected tweets and their sentiments. [sent-125, score-0.989]
</p><p>69 The dashboard includes another page  (Figure 4) that displays the most positive, negative and frequent tweets, as well as some random neutral tweets. [sent-126, score-0.297]
</p><p>70 It also shows the total volume over time and a tag cloud of the most frequent words in the last five minutes across all candidates. [sent-127, score-0.108]
</p><p>71 Another crucial feature of this page is that clicking on one of the tweets brings up an annotation interface, so the user can provide his/her own assessment of the sentiment expressed in the tweet. [sent-128, score-0.84]
</p><p>72 6  Annotation Interface  The online annotation interface shown in Figure 5 lets dashboard (Figure 4) users provide their own judgment of a tweet. [sent-131, score-0.287]
</p><p>73 The tweet’s text is displayed at the top, and users can rate the sentiment toward  the candidate mentioned in the tweet as positive, negative or neutral or mark it as unsure. [sent-132, score-0.883]
</p><p>74 There are also two options to specify whether a tweet is sarcastic and/or funny. [sent-133, score-0.255]
</p><p>75 This interface is a simplified version of the one we used to collect annotations from Amazon Mechanical Turk so that annotation can be performed quickly on a single tweet. [sent-134, score-0.094]
</p><p>76 The online interface is designed to be used while watching a campaign event and can be displayed on a tablet or smart phone. [sent-135, score-0.163]
</p><p>77 The feedback from users allows annotation of recent data as well as the ability to correct misclassifications. [sent-136, score-0.074]
</p><p>78 As a future step, we plan to 119 establish an online feedback loop between users and the sentiment model, so users’ judgment serves to train the model actively and iteratively. [sent-137, score-0.529]
</p><p>79 3, we described our preliminary sentiment model that automatically classifies tweets into four categories: positive, negative, neutral or unsure. [sent-139, score-0.901]
</p><p>80 It copes well with the negative bias in political tweets. [sent-140, score-0.305]
</p><p>81 In addition to evaluating  the model using annotated data, we have also begun conducting correlational analysis of aggregated sentiment with political events and news, as well as indicators such as poll and election results. [sent-141, score-0.961]
</p><p>82 We are exploring whether variations in twitter sentiment and tweet volume  are predictive or reflective of real-world events and news. [sent-142, score-1.179]
</p><p>83 While this quantitative analysis is part of ongoing work, we present below some quantitative and qualitative expert observations indicative of promising research directions. [sent-143, score-0.036]
</p><p>84 One finding is that tweet volume is largely driven by campaign events. [sent-144, score-0.319]
</p><p>85 Of the 50 top hourly intervals between Oct 12, 201 1 and Feb 29, 2012, ranked by tweet volume, all but two correspond either to President Obama’s State of the Union address, televised primary debates or moments when caucus or primary election results were released. [sent-145, score-0.644]
</p><p>86 Out of the 100 top hourly intervals, all but 18 correspond to such events. [sent-146, score-0.046]
</p><p>87 It caused the biggest volume we have seen in a single day since last October, 1. [sent-148, score-0.096]
</p><p>88 Both positive and negative tweets for President Obama increased three to four times comparing to an average day. [sent-150, score-0.538]
</p><p>89 During the Republican Primary debate on Jan 19, 2012 in Charleston, NC one of the Republican candidates, Newt Gingrich, was asked about his ex-wife at the beginning of the debate. [sent-151, score-0.057]
</p><p>90 Within minutes, our dashboard showed his negative sentiment increase rapidly – it became three times  more negative in just two minutes. [sent-152, score-0.717]
</p><p>91 This illustrates how tweet volume and sentiment are extremely responsive to emerging events in the real world (Vergeer et al. [sent-153, score-0.807]
</p><p>92 These examples confirm our assessment that it is especially relevant to offer a system that can provide real-time analysis during key moments in the election cycle. [sent-155, score-0.255]
</p><p>93 As the election continues and culminates with the presidential vote this November, we hope that our system will provide rich insights into the evolution of public sentiment toward the contenders. [sent-156, score-0.968]
</p><p>94 5  Conclusion  We presented a system for real-time Twitter sentiment analysis of the ongoing 2012 U. [sent-157, score-0.441]
</p><p>95 We use the Twitter “firehose” and expert-curated rules and keywords to get a full 120 and accurate picture of the online political landscape. [sent-160, score-0.258]
</p><p>96 Our real-time data processing infrastructure and statistical sentiment model evaluates public sentiment changes in response to emerging political events and news as they unfold. [sent-161, score-1.368]

As one of the most popular micro-blogging services, Twitter attracts millions of users, producing millions of tweets daily. Shared information through this service spreads faster than would have been possible with traditional sources, however the proliferation of user-generation content poses challenges to browsing and finding valuable information. In this paper we propose a graph-theoretic model for tweet recommendation that presents users with items they may have an interest in. Our model ranks tweets and their authors simultaneously using several networks: the social network connecting the users, the network connecting the tweets, and a third network that ties the two together. Tweet and author entities are ranked following a co-ranking algorithm based on the intuition that that there is a mutually reinforcing relationship between tweets and their authors that could be reflected in the rankings. We show that this framework can be parametrized to take into account user preferences, the popularity of tweets and their authors, and diversity. Experimental evaluation on a large dataset shows that our model out- performs competitive approaches by a large margin.</p><p>3 0.34818071 <a title="21-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-QuickView%3A_NLP-based_Tweet_Search.html">167 acl-2012-QuickView: NLP-based Tweet Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaohua Liu ; Furu Wei ; Ming Zhou ; QuickView Team Microsoft</p><p>Abstract: Tweets have become a comprehensive repository for real-time information. However, it is often hard for users to quickly get information they are interested in from tweets, owing to the sheer volume of tweets as well as their noisy and informal nature. We present QuickView, an NLP-based tweet search platform to tackle this issue. Specifically, it exploits a series of natural language processing technologies, such as tweet normalization, named entity recognition, semantic role labeling, sentiment analysis, tweet classification, to extract useful information, i.e., named entities, events, opinions, etc., from a large volume of tweets.

Previous works have showed that supervised learning methods are superior for this task. However, the performance of supervised methods highly relies on manually labeled training data. In this paper, we propose a domain adaptation framework for sentiment- and topic- lexicon co-extraction in a domain of interest where we do not require any labeled data, but have lots of labeled data in another related domain. The framework is twofold. In the first step, we generate a few high-confidence sentiment and topic seeds in the target domain. In the second step, we propose a novel Relational Adaptive bootstraPping (RAP) algorithm to expand the seeds in the target domain by exploiting the labeled source domain data and the relationships between topic and sentiment words. Experimental results show that our domain adaptation framework can extract precise lexicons in the target domain without any annotation.</p><p>5 0.25537223 <a title="21-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Extracting_and_modeling_durations_for_habits_and_events_from_Twitter.html">91 acl-2012-Extracting and modeling durations for habits and events from Twitter</a></p>

A corpus of more than 14 million tweets containing temporal duration information was collected. These tweets were classified as to their habituality status using a bootstrapped, decision tree. For each verb lemma, associated duration information was collected for episodic and habitual uses of the verb. Summary statistics for 483 verb lemmas and their typical habit and episode durations has been compiled and made available. This automatically generated duration information is broadly comparable to hand-annotation. 1</p><p>6 0.20357373 <a title="21-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Cross-Lingual_Mixture_Model_for_Sentiment_Classification.html">62 acl-2012-Cross-Lingual Mixture Model for Sentiment Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiaohua Liu ; Furu Wei ; Ming Zhou ; QuickView Team Microsoft</p><p>Abstract: Tweets have become a comprehensive repository for real-time information. However, it is often hard for users to quickly get information they are interested in from tweets, owing to the sheer volume of tweets as well as their noisy and informal nature. We present QuickView, an NLP-based tweet search platform to tackle this issue. Specifically, it exploits a series of natural language processing technologies, such as tweet normalization, named entity recognition, semantic role labeling, sentiment analysis, tweet classification, to extract useful information, i.e., named entities, events, opinions, etc., from a large volume of tweets. Then, non-noisy tweets, together with the mined information, are indexed, on top of which two brand new scenarios are enabled, i.e., categorized browsing and advanced search, allowing users to effectively access either the tweets or fine-grained information they are interested in.</p><p>3 0.76552558 <a title="21-lsi-3" href="./acl-2012-Tweet_Recommendation_with_Graph_Co-Ranking.html">205 acl-2012-Tweet Recommendation with Graph Co-Ranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui Yan ; Mirella Lapata ; Xiaoming Li</p><p>Abstract: Mirella Lapata‡ Xiaoming Li†, \ ‡Institute for Language, \State Key Laboratory of Software Cognition and Computation, Development Environment, University of Edinburgh, Beihang University, Edinburgh EH8 9AB, UK Beijing 100083, China mlap@ inf .ed .ac .uk lxm@pku .edu .cn 2012.1 Twitter enables users to send and read textbased posts ofup to 140 characters, known as tweets. As one of the most popular micro-blogging services, Twitter attracts millions of users, producing millions of tweets daily. Shared information through this service spreads faster than would have been possible with traditional sources, however the proliferation of user-generation content poses challenges to browsing and finding valuable information. In this paper we propose a graph-theoretic model for tweet recommendation that presents users with items they may have an interest in. Our model ranks tweets and their authors simultaneously using several networks: the social network connecting the users, the network connecting the tweets, and a third network that ties the two together. Tweet and author entities are ranked following a co-ranking algorithm based on the intuition that that there is a mutually reinforcing relationship between tweets and their authors that could be reflected in the rankings. We show that this framework can be parametrized to take into account user preferences, the popularity of tweets and their authors, and diversity. Experimental evaluation on a large dataset shows that our model out- performs competitive approaches by a large margin.</p><p>4 0.61809713 <a title="21-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-Self-Disclosure_and_Relationship_Strength_in_Twitter_Conversations.html">173 acl-2012-Self-Disclosure and Relationship Strength in Twitter Conversations</a></p>
<p>Author: JinYeong Bak ; Suin Kim ; Alice Oh</p><p>Abstract: In social psychology, it is generally accepted that one discloses more of his/her personal information to someone in a strong relationship. We present a computational framework for automatically analyzing such self-disclosure behavior in Twitter conversations. Our framework uses text mining techniques to discover topics, emotions, sentiments, lexical patterns, as well as personally identifiable information (PII) and personally embarrassing information (PEI). Our preliminary results illustrate that in relationships with high relationship strength, Twitter users show significantly more frequent behaviors of self-disclosure.</p><p>5 0.60959268 <a title="21-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-Extracting_and_modeling_durations_for_habits_and_events_from_Twitter.html">91 acl-2012-Extracting and modeling durations for habits and events from Twitter</a></p>

<p>Author: Elif Yamangil ; Stuart Shieber</p><p>Abstract: We present a Bayesian nonparametric model for estimating tree insertion grammars (TIG), building upon recent work in Bayesian inference of tree substitution grammars (TSG) via Dirichlet processes. Under our general variant of TIG, grammars are estimated via the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm that uses a context free grammar transformation as a proposal, which allows for cubic-time string parsing as well as tree-wide joint sampling of derivations in the spirit of Cohn and Blunsom (2010). We use the Penn treebank for our experiments and find that our proposal Bayesian TIG model not only has competitive parsing performance but also finds compact yet linguistically rich TIG representations of the data.</p><p>3 0.62294453 <a title="21-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Semantic_Parsing_with_Bayesian_Tree_Transducers.html">174 acl-2012-Semantic Parsing with Bayesian Tree Transducers</a></p>
<p>Author: Bevan Jones ; Mark Johnson ; Sharon Goldwater</p><p>Abstract: Many semantic parsing models use tree transformations to map between natural language and meaning representation. However, while tree transformations are central to several state-of-the-art approaches, little use has been made of the rich literature on tree automata. This paper makes the connection concrete with a tree transducer based semantic parsing model and suggests that other models can be interpreted in a similar framework, increasing the generality of their contributions. In particular, this paper further introduces a variational Bayesian inference algorithm that is applicable to a wide class of tree transducers, producing state-of-the-art semantic parsing results while remaining applicable to any domain employing probabilistic tree transducers.</p><p>4 0.62281871 <a title="21-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Efficient_Tree-Based_Topic_Modeling.html">79 acl-2012-Efficient Tree-Based Topic Modeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuening Hu ; Jordan Boyd-Graber</p><p>Abstract: Topic modeling with a tree-based prior has been used for a variety of applications because it can encode correlations between words that traditional topic modeling cannot. However, its expressive power comes at the cost of more complicated inference. We extend the SPARSELDA (Yao et al., 2009) inference scheme for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to tree-based topic models. This sampling scheme computes the exact conditional distribution for Gibbs sampling much more quickly than enumerating all possible latent variable assignments. We further improve performance by iteratively refining the sampling distribution only when needed. Experiments show that the proposed techniques dramatically improve the computation time.</p><p>5 0.62246126 <a title="21-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Learning_the_Latent_Semantics_of_a_Concept_from_its_Definition.html">132 acl-2012-Learning the Latent Semantics of a Concept from its Definition</a></p>

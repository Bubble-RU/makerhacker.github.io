</p><p>2 In order to satisfy the increasing text analytics demands of enterprise applications, it is crucial to enable developers with general computer science background to develop high quality IE extractors. [sent-6, score-0.373]
</p><p>3 In this demonstration, we present WizIE, an IE development environment intended to reduce the development life cycle and enable developers with little or no linguistic background to write high quality IE rules. [sent-7, score-0.529]
</p><p>4 WizI E provides an integrated wizard-like environment that guides IE developers step-by-step throughout the entire development process, based on best practices synthesized from the experience of expert developers. [sent-8, score-0.64]
</p><p>5 In addition, WizIE reduces the manual effort involved in performing key IE development tasks by offering automatic result explanation and rule discovery functionality. [sent-9, score-0.343]
</p><p>6 Preliminary results indicate that WizI E is a step  forward towards enabling extractor development for novice IE developers. [sent-10, score-0.534]
</p><p>7 In recent years, IE has emerged as a critical building block in a wide range of enterprise applications, including financial risk analysis, social media analytics and regulatory compliance, among many others. [sent-13, score-0.215]
</p><p>8 An important practical challenge driven by the use of IE in these applications is usability (Chiticariu et al. [sent-14, score-0.03]
</p><p>9 , 2010c): specifically, 109 how to enable the ease of development and maintenance of high-quality information extraction rules, also known as annotators, or extractors. [sent-15, score-0.251]
</p><p>10 Developing extractors is a notoriously laborintensive and time-consuming process. [sent-16, score-0.165]
</p><p>11 As a result, extractor develop-  ment is regarded as a major bottleneck in satisfying the increasing text analytics demands of enterprise applications. [sent-18, score-0.465]
</p><p>12 Hence, reducing the extractor development life cycle is a critical requirement. [sent-19, score-0.51]
</p><p>13 Towards this goal, we have built WizIE, an IE development environment designed primarily to (1) enable developers with little or no linguistic background to write high quality extractors, and (2) reduce the overall manual effort involved in extractor development. [sent-20, score-0.69]
</p><p>14 Previous work on improving the usability of IE systems has mainly focused on reducing the manual effort involved in extractor development (Brauer et al. [sent-21, score-0.48]
</p><p>15 In contrast, the focus of WizIE is on lowering the extractor development entry barrier by means of a wizard-like environment that guides extractor development based on best practices drawn from the experience of trained linguists and expert developers. [sent-26, score-1.221]
</p><p>16 In doing so, WizIE also provides natural entry points for different tools focused on reducing the effort required for performing common tasks during IE development. [sent-27, score-0.093]
</p><p>17 Underlying our WizIE are a state-of-the-art IE rule language and corresponding runtime en-  gine (Chiticariu et al. [sent-28, score-0.186]

</p><p>19 2 System Overview The development process for high-quality, highperformance extractors consists of four phases, as illustrated in Fig. [sent-34, score-0.269]
</p><p>20 First, in the Task Analysis phase, concrete extraction tasks are defined based on high-level business requirements. [sent-36, score-0.26]
</p><p>21 For each extraction task, IE rules are developed during the Rule Development phase. [sent-37, score-0.157]
</p><p>22 The rules are profiled and further fine-tuned in the Performance Tuning phase, to ensure high runtime performance. [sent-38, score-0.147]
</p><p>23 Finally, in the Delivery phase, the rules are packaged so that they can be easily embedded in various applications. [sent-39, score-0.054]
</p><p>24 WizIE is designed to assist and enable both novice and experienced developers by providing an intuitive wizard-like interface that is informed by the  best practices in extractor development throughout each of these phases. [sent-40, score-0.745]
</p><p>25 By doing so, WizIE seeks to provide the key missing pieces in a conventional IE development environment (Cunningham et al. [sent-41, score-0.204]
</p><p>26 , 2011), based on our experience as expert IE developers, as well as our interactions with novice developers with general computer science background, but little text analytics experience, during the development of several enterprise applications. [sent-44, score-0.579]
</p><p>27 3 The Development Environment In this section, we present the general functionality of WizIE in the context of extraction tasks driven by real business use cases from the media and entertainment domain. [sent-45, score-0.272]
</p><p>28 We describe WizIE in details and show how it guides and assists IE developers in a step-by-step fashion, based on best practices. [sent-46, score-0.269]
</p><p>29 1 Task Analysis The high-level business requirement of our running example is to identify intention to purchase for movies from online forums. [sent-48, score-0.259]
</p><p>30 The definition and context of the concrete extraction tasks are captured by a tree structure called the extraction plan (e. [sent-52, score-0.324]
</p><p>31 Each leaf node in an extraction plan corresponds to an atomic extraction task, while the non-leaf nodes denote higher-level tasks based on one or more atomic extraction tasks. [sent-56, score-0.461]
</p><p>32 For instance, in our running example, the business question of identifying intention of purchase for movies has been converted into the extraction task of identifying MovieIntent mentions, which involves two atomic extraction tasks: identifying Movie mentions and Intent mentions. [sent-57, score-0.63]
</p><p>33 The extraction plan created, as we will describe later, plays a key role in the IE development process  in WizIE. [sent-58, score-0.249]
</p><p>34 Such tight coupling of task analysis with actual extractor development is a key departure from conventional IE development environments. [sent-59, score-0.521]
</p><p>35 2 Rule Development Once concrete extraction tasks are defined, WizIE guides the IE developer to write actual rules based on best practices. [sent-61, score-0.603]
</p><p>36 3(a) shows a screenshot of the second phase of building an extractor, the Rule Development phase. [sent-63, score-0.034]
</p><p>37 The Extraction Task panel on the left provides information and tips for rule development, whereas the Extraction Plan panel on the right guides the actual rule development for each extraction task. [sent-64, score-0.678]
</p><p>38 As shown in the figure, the types of rules associated with each label node fall into three categories: Basic Features, Can1The  exact  sample size varies by task  type. [sent-65, score-0.086]
</p><p>39 ; This categorization is based on best practices for rule development (Chiticariu et al. [sent-67, score-0.287]
</p><p>40 As such, the extraction plan groups together the high-level specification of extraction tasks via examples, and the actual implementation of those tasks via rules. [sent-69, score-0.312]
</p><p>41 The developer creates rules directly in the Rule Editor, or via the Create Statement wizard, accessible from the Statements node of each label in the Extraction Plan panel:  Thewizard lowstheusertoselctaypefor  the new rule, from predefined sets for each of the three categories. [sent-70, score-0.275]
</p><p>42 The types of rules exposed in each category are informed by best practices. [sent-71, score-0.054]
</p><p>43 Once the developer provides a name for the new rule (view) and selects its type, the appropriate rule template (such as the one illustrated below) is automatically generated in an appropriate file on disk and 111 displayed in the editor, for further editing 2. [sent-73, score-0.407]
</p><p>44 Once the developer completes an iteration of rule development, WizIE guides her in testing and refining the extractor, as shown in Fig. [sent-74, score-0.54]
</p><p>45 The Annotation Explorer at the bottom of the screen gives a global view of the extraction results, while other panels highlight individual results in the context of the original input documents. [sent-76, score-0.103]
</p><p>46 WizIE also provides a facility for manually labeling a document collection with “ground truth” annotations, then comparing the extraction results with the ground truth in order to formally evaluate the quality of the extractor and avoid regressions during the development process. [sent-78, score-0.56]
</p><p>47 An important differentiator of WizI E compared with conventional IE development environments is a suite of sophisticated tools for automatic result explanation and rule discovery. [sent-79, score-0.271]
</p><p>48 When the user clicks on an extracted result, the Provenance Viewer shows a complete explanation of how that result has been pro2Details  on  the rule syntax  can  be found in (IBM, )  Figure 3: Extractor Development:  (a) Developing, and (b) Testing. [sent-82, score-0.139]
</p><p>49 duced by the extractor, in the form of a graph that demonstrates the sequence of rules and individual pieces of text responsible for that result. [sent-83, score-0.054]
</p><p>50 Such explanations are critical to enable the developer to understand why a false positive is generated by the system, and identify problematic rule(s) that could be refined in order to correct the mistake. [sent-84, score-0.335]
</p><p>51 An example explanation for an incorrect MovieIntent mention “I just saw Mission Impossible ” is shown below. [sent-85, score-0.113]
</p><p>52 With this information, the  developer can quickly determine that the SelfRef and MovieName mentions are correct, but their combination in MovieIntentCandidate is problematic. [sent-87, score-0.301]
</p><p>53 She can then proceed to refine the MovieIntentCandidate rule, for example, by avoiding any MovieIntentCandidate mentions containing a past tense verb form such as 112 saw, since past tense in not usually indicative of intent (Liu et al. [sent-88, score-0.148]
</p><p>54 Negative contextual clues such as the verb “saw” above are useful for creating rules that filter out false positives. [sent-91, score-0.162]
</p><p>55 Conversely, positive clues such as the phrase “will see ” are useful for creating rules that separate ambiguous matches from high-precision matches. [sent-92, score-0.132]
</p><p>56 WizIE’s Pattern Discovery component facilitates automatic discovery of such clues by mining available sample data for common patterns in specific contexts (Li et al. [sent-93, score-0.142]
</p><p>57 For example, when instructed to analyze the context between SelfRef and MovieName mentions, Pattern Discovery finds a suite of common patterns as shown in Fig. [sent-95, score-0.03]
</p><p>58 The developer can analyze these patterns and choose those suitable for refining the rules. [sent-97, score-0.266]
</p><p>59 For  example, patterns such as “have to see” can be seen as positive clues for intent, whereas phrases such as “took . [sent-98, score-0.078]
</p><p>60 WizIE also enables the discovery of regular expression patterns. [sent-103, score-0.129]
</p><p>61 The Regular Expression Generator takes as input a  set of sample mentions and suggests regular expres-  sions that capture the samples, ranging from more specific (higher accuracy) to more general expressions (higher coverage). [sent-104, score-0.22]
</p><p>62 Figure 5 shows two regular expressions automatically generated based on mentions of movie ratings, and how the developer is subsequently assisted in understanding and refining the generated expression. [sent-105, score-0.454]
</p><p>63 In our experience, regular expressions are complex concepts that are difficult to develop for both expert and novice developers. [sent-106, score-0.247]
</p><p>64 Therefore, such a facility to generate expressions based on examples is extremely useful. [sent-107, score-0.076]
</p><p>65 3 Performance Tuning Once the developer is satisfied with the quality ofthe extractor, WizIE guides her in measuring and tuning its runtime performance, in preparation for deploying the extractor in a production environment. [sent-109, score-0.848]
</p><p>66 The Profiler observes the execution of the extractor on a sample input collection over a period of time and records the percentage of time spent executing each rule, or performing certain runtime operations. [sent-110, score-0.41]
</p><p>67 After 113 the profiling run completes, WizIE displays the top  25 most expensive rules and runtime operations, and the overall throughput (amount of input data processed per unit of time). [sent-111, score-0.147]
</p><p>68 Based on this information, the developer can hand-tune the critical parts of the extractor, rerun the Profiler, and validate an increase in throughput. [sent-112, score-0.261]
</p><p>69 She would repeat this process until satisfied with the extractor’s runtime performance. [sent-113, score-0.131]
</p><p>70 4 Delivery and Deployment Once satisfied with both the result quality and runtime performance, the developer is guided by WizIE’s Export wizard through the process of exporting the extractor in a compiled executable form. [sent-115, score-0.736]
</p><p>71 The generated executable can be embedded in an application using a Java API interface. [sent-116, score-0.056]
</p><p>72 WizIE can also wrap the executable plan in a pre-packaged application that can be run in a map-reduce environment, then deploy this application on a Hadoop cluster. [sent-117, score-0.098]
</p><p>73 4 Evaluation A preliminary user study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of WizIE in enabling novice IE developers. [sent-118, score-0.145]
</p><p>74 In the  pre-study survey, 10 of the participants reported no prior experience with IE tasks, two of them have seen demonstrations of IE systems, and two had brief involvement in IE development, but no experience with WizIE. [sent-120, score-0.264]
</p><p>75 In Day 1, participants were given a thorough introduction to IE, shown example extractors, and instructed to develop extractors without WizIE. [sent-124, score-0.323]
</p><p>76 Towards the end of Day 1, participants were asked to solve an IE exercise: develop an extractor for the high-level requirement of identifying mentions of company revenue by division from the company’s official press releases. [sent-125, score-0.571]
</p><p>77 WizIE was introduced to the participants in Day 2 of the training, and its features were demonstrated and explained with examples. [sent-126, score-0.128]
</p><p>78 Participants were then asked to complete the same exercise as in Day 1. [sent-127, score-0.075]
</p><p>79 Authors of this demonstration were present to help participants during the exercises in both days. [sent-128, score-0.176]
</p><p>80 At the end of each day, participants filled out a survey about their experience. [sent-129, score-0.155]
</p><p>81 In Day 1, none of the participants were able to complete the exercise after 90 minutes. [sent-130, score-0.203]
</p><p>82 In the survey, one participant wrote “I am in sales so it is all difficult”; another participant indicated that “I don ’t think I would be able to recreate the example on my own from scratch ”. [sent-131, score-0.137]
</p><p>83 In Day 2, most participants were able to complete the exercise in 90 minutes or less using WizIE. [sent-132, score-0.203]
</p><p>84 In fact, two participants created extractors with accuracy and coverage of over 90%, when measured against the ground truth. [sent-133, score-0.324]
</p><p>85 Overall, the participants were much more confident about creating extractors. [sent-134, score-0.128]
</p><p>86 One participant wrote “My first impression is very good”. [sent-135, score-0.082]
</p><p>87 On the other hand, another participant asserted that “The nature of the task is still difficult”. [sent-136, score-0.055]
</p><p>88 They also found that WizIE is useful and easy to use, and it is easier to build extractors with the help of WizIE. [sent-137, score-0.165]
</p><p>89 In summary, our preliminary results indicate that WizIE is a step forward towards enabling extractor development for novice IE developers. [sent-138, score-0.534]
</p><p>90 In order to formally evaluate WizIE, we are currently conducting a formal study of using WizIE to create extractors for several real business applications. [sent-139, score-0.246]
</p><p>91 5  Demonstration  In this demonstration we showcase WizIE’s step-bystep approach to guide the developer in the iterative process of IE rule development, from task analysis to developing, tuning and deploying the extractor in a production environment. [sent-140, score-0.746]
</p><p>92 Our demonstration is centered around the high-level business requirement 114 of identifying intent to purchase movies from blogs and forum posts as described in Section 3. [sent-141, score-0.376]
</p><p>93 We start by demonstrating the process of developing two relatively simple extractors for identifying MovieIntent and MovieRating mentions. [sent-142, score-0.232]
</p><p>94 We then showcase complex state-of-the-art extractors for identifying buzz and sentiment for the media and entertainment domain, to illustrate the quality and runtime performance of extractors built with WizIE. [sent-143, score-0.547]

<p>Author: Naomi Zeichner ; Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: The importance of inference rules to semantic applications has long been recognized and extensive work has been carried out to automatically acquire inference-rule resources. However, evaluating such resources has turned out to be a non-trivial task, slowing progress in the field. In this paper, we suggest a framework for evaluating inference-rule resources. Our framework simplifies a previously proposed “instance-based evaluation” method that involved substantial annotator training, making it suitable for crowdsourcing. We show that our method produces a large amount of annotations with high inter-annotator agreement for a low cost at a short period of time, without requiring training expert annotators.</p><p>3 0.070810154 <a title="215-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Fully_Abstractive_Approach_to_Guided_Summarization.html">101 acl-2012-Fully Abstractive Approach to Guided Summarization</a></p>

<p>Author: Seokhwan Kim ; Gary Geunbae Lee</p><p>Abstract: Although researchers have conducted extensive studies on relation extraction in the last decade, supervised approaches are still limited because they require large amounts of training data to achieve high performances. To build a relation extractor without significant annotation effort, we can exploit cross-lingual annotation projection, which leverages parallel corpora as external resources for supervision. This paper proposes a novel graph-based projection approach and demonstrates the merits of it by using a Korean relation extraction system based on projected dataset from an English-Korean parallel corpus.</p><p>5 0.054021683 <a title="215-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Discriminative_Learning_for_Joint_Template_Filling.html">73 acl-2012-Discriminative Learning for Joint Template Filling</a></p>
<p>Author: Einat Minkov ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a joint model for template filling, where the goal is to automatically specify the fields of target relations such as seminar announcements or corporate acquisition events. The approach models mention detection, unification and field extraction in a flexible, feature-rich model that allows for joint modeling of interdependencies at all levels and across fields. Such an approach can, for example, learn likely event durations and the fact that start times should come before end times. While the joint inference space is large, we demonstrate effective learning with a Perceptron-style approach that uses simple, greedy beam decoding. Empirical results in two benchmark domains demonstrate consistently strong performance on both mention de- tection and template filling tasks.</p><p>6 0.049981955 <a title="215-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Learning_to_%22Read_Between_the_Lines%22_using_Bayesian_Logic_Programs.html">133 acl-2012-Learning to "Read Between the Lines" using Bayesian Logic Programs</a></p>

<p>Author: Yunyao Li ; Laura Chiticariu ; Huahai Yang ; Frederick Reiss ; Arnaldo Carreno-fuentes</p><p>Abstract: Information extraction (IE) is becoming a critical building block in many enterprise applications. In order to satisfy the increasing text analytics demands of enterprise applications, it is crucial to enable developers with general computer science background to develop high quality IE extractors. In this demonstration, we present WizIE, an IE development environment intended to reduce the development life cycle and enable developers with little or no linguistic background to write high quality IE rules. WizI E provides an integrated wizard-like environment that guides IE developers step-by-step throughout the entire development process, based on best practices synthesized from the experience of expert developers. In addition, WizIE reduces the manual effort involved in performing key IE development tasks by offering automatic result explanation and rule discovery functionality.

<p>Author: Naomi Zeichner ; Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: The importance of inference rules to semantic applications has long been recognized and extensive work has been carried out to automatically acquire inference-rule resources. However, evaluating such resources has turned out to be a non-trivial task, slowing progress in the field. In this paper, we suggest a framework for evaluating inference-rule resources. Our framework simplifies a previously proposed “instance-based evaluation” method that involved substantial annotator training, making it suitable for crowdsourcing. We show that our method produces a large amount of annotations with high inter-annotator agreement for a low cost at a short period of time, without requiring training expert annotators.</p><p>3 0.49768087 <a title="215-lsi-3" href="./acl-2012-Structuring_E-Commerce_Inventory.html">186 acl-2012-Structuring E-Commerce Inventory</a></p>

While some sellers provide rich, structured descriptions of their items, a vast majority of them provide unstructured natural language descriptions. In the paper we present a 2 steps method for structuring items into descriptive properties. The first step consists in unsupervised property discovery and extraction. The second step involves supervised property synonym discovery using a maximum entropy based clustering algorithm. We evaluate our method on a year worth of ecommerce data and show that it achieves excellent precision with good recall.</p><p>4 0.493976 <a title="215-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-Building_Trainable_Taggers_in_a_Web-based%2C_UIMA-Supported_NLP_Workbench.html">43 acl-2012-Building Trainable Taggers in a Web-based, UIMA-Supported NLP Workbench</a></p>
<p>Author: Rafal Rak ; BalaKrishna Kolluru ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: Argo is a web-based NLP and text mining workbench with a convenient graphical user interface for designing and executing processing workflows of various complexity. The workbench is intended for specialists and nontechnical audiences alike, and provides the ever expanding library of analytics compliant with the Unstructured Information Management Architecture, a widely adopted interoperability framework. We explore the flexibility of this framework by demonstrating workflows involving three processing components capable of performing self-contained machine learning-based tagging. The three components are responsible for the three distinct tasks of 1) generating observations or features, 2) training a statistical model based on the generated features, and 3) tagging unlabelled data with the model. The learning and tagging components are based on an implementation of conditional random fields (CRF); whereas the feature generation component is an analytic capable of extending basic token information to a comprehensive set of features. Users define the features of their choice directly from Argo’s graphical interface, without resorting to programming (a commonly used approach to feature engineering). The experimental results performed on two tagging tasks, chunking and named entity recognition, showed that a tagger with a generic set of features built in Argo is capable of competing with taskspecific solutions. 121</p><p>5 0.48126629 <a title="215-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-Concept-to-text_Generation_via_Discriminative_Reranking.html">57 acl-2012-Concept-to-text Generation via Discriminative Reranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Ioannis Konstas ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven method for concept-to-text generation, the task of automatically producing textual output from non-linguistic input. A key insight in our approach is to reduce the tasks of content selection (“what to say”) and surface realization (“how to say”) into a common parsing problem. We define a probabilistic context-free grammar that describes the structure of the input (a corpus of database records and text describing some of them) and represent it compactly as a weighted hypergraph. The hypergraph structure encodes exponentially many derivations, which we rerank discriminatively using local and global features. We propose a novel decoding algorithm for finding the best scoring derivation and generating in this setting. Experimental evaluation on the ATIS domain shows that our model outperforms a competitive discriminative system both using BLEU and in a judgment elicitation study.</p><p>6 0.47795638 <a title="215-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-Discriminative_Learning_for_Joint_Template_Filling.html">73 acl-2012-Discriminative Learning for Joint Template Filling</a></p>

<p>Author: Toshikazu Tajiri ; Mamoru Komachi ; Yuji Matsumoto</p><p>Abstract: As the number of learners of English is constantly growing, automatic error correction of ESL learners’ writing is an increasingly active area of research. However, most research has mainly focused on errors concerning articles and prepositions even though tense/aspect errors are also important. One of the main reasons why tense/aspect error correction is difficult is that the choice of tense/aspect is highly dependent on global context. Previous research on grammatical error correction typically uses pointwise prediction that performs classification on each word independently, and thus fails to capture the information of neighboring labels. In order to take global information into account, we regard the task as sequence labeling: each verb phrase in a document is labeled with tense/aspect depending on surrounding labels. Our experiments show that the global context makes a moderate con- tribution to tense/aspect error correction.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.91122156 <a title="215-lda-2" href="./acl-2012-WizIE%3A_A_Best_Practices_Guided_Development_Environment_for_Information_Extraction.html">215 acl-2012-WizIE: A Best Practices Guided Development Environment for Information Extraction</a></p>

<p>Author: Ariya Rastrow ; Mark Dredze ; Sanjeev Khudanpur</p><p>Abstract: Long-span features, such as syntax, can improve language models for tasks such as speech recognition and machine translation. However, these language models can be difficult to use in practice because of the time required to generate features for rescoring a large hypothesis set. In this work, we propose substructure sharing, which saves duplicate work in processing hypothesis sets with redundant hypothesis structures. We apply substructure sharing to a dependency parser and part of speech tagger to obtain significant speedups, and further improve the accuracy of these tools through up-training. When using these improved tools in a language model for speech recognition, we obtain significant speed improvements with both N-best and hill climbing rescoring, and show that up-training leads to WER reduction.</p><p>4 0.73366201 <a title="215-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Maximum_Expected_BLEU_Training_of_Phrase_and_Lexicon_Translation_Models.html">141 acl-2012-Maximum Expected BLEU Training of Phrase and Lexicon Translation Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaodong He ; Li Deng</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new discriminative training method in constructing phrase and lexicon translation models. In order to reliably learn a myriad of parameters in these models, we propose an expected BLEU score-based utility function with KL regularization as the objective, and train the models on a large parallel dataset. For training, we derive growth transformations for phrase and lexicon translation probabilities to iteratively improve the objective. The proposed method, evaluated on the Europarl German-to-English dataset, leads to a 1.1 BLEU point improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline translation system. In IWSLT 201 1 Benchmark, our system using the proposed method achieves the best Chinese-to-English translation result on the task of translating TED talks.</p><p>5 0.56114995 <a title="215-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Fast_and_Scalable_Decoding_with_Language_Model_Look-Ahead_for_Phrase-based_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">97 acl-2012-Fast and Scalable Decoding with Language Model Look-Ahead for Phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Joern Wuebker ; Hermann Ney ; Richard Zens</p><p>Abstract: In this work we present two extensions to the well-known dynamic programming beam search in phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT), aiming at increased efficiency of decoding by minimizing the number of language model computations and hypothesis expansions. Our results show that language model based pre-sorting yields a small improvement in translation quality and a speedup by a factor of 2. Two look-ahead methods are shown to further increase translation speed by a factor of2 without changing the search space and a factor of 4 with the side-effect of some additional search errors. We compare our ap- proach with Moses and observe the same performance, but a substantially better trade-off between translation quality and speed. At a speed of roughly 70 words per second, Moses reaches 17.2% BLEU, whereas our approach yields 20.0% with identical models.</p><p>6 0.54677683 <a title="215-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-How_Are_Spelling_Errors_Generated_and_Corrected%3F_A_Study_of_Corrected_and_Uncorrected_Spelling_Errors_Using_Keystroke_Logs.html">111 acl-2012-How Are Spelling Errors Generated and Corrected?

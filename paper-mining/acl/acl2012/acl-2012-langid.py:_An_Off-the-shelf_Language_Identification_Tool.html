<p>Author: Alexandre Davis ; Adriano Veloso ; Altigran Soares ; Alberto Laender ; Wagner Meira Jr.</p><p>Abstract: The named entity disambiguation task is to resolve the many-to-many correspondence between ambiguous names and the unique realworld entity. This task can be modeled as a classification problem, provided that positive and negative examples are available for learning binary classifiers. High-quality senseannotated data, however, are hard to be obtained in streaming environments, since the training corpus would have to be constantly updated in order to accomodate the fresh data coming on the stream. On the other hand, few positive examples plus large amounts of unlabeled data may be easily acquired. Producing binary classifiers directly from this data, however, leads to poor disambiguation performance. Thus, we propose to enhance the quality of the classifiers using finer-grained variations of the well-known ExpectationMaximization (EM) algorithm. We conducted a systematic evaluation using Twitter streaming data and the results show that our classifiers are extremely effective, providing improvements ranging from 1% to 20%, when compared to the current state-of-the-art biased SVMs, being more than 120 times faster.</p><p>3 0.051916365 <a title="219-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-A_System_for_Real-time_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_of_2012_U.S._Presidential_Election_Cycle.html">21 acl-2012-A System for Real-time Twitter Sentiment Analysis of 2012 U.S. Presidential Election Cycle</a></p>
<p>Author: Hao Wang ; Dogan Can ; Abe Kazemzadeh ; Francois Bar ; Shrikanth Narayanan</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a system for real-time analysis of public sentiment toward presidential candidates in the 2012 U.S. election as expressed on Twitter, a microblogging service. Twitter has become a central site where people express their opinions and views on political parties and candidates. Emerging events or news are often followed almost instantly by a burst in Twitter volume, providing a unique opportunity to gauge the relation between expressed public sentiment and electoral events. In addition, sentiment analysis can help explore how these events affect public opinion. While traditional content analysis takes days or weeks to complete, the system demonstrated here analyzes sentiment in the entire Twitter traffic about the election, delivering results instantly and continuously. It offers the public, the media, politicians and scholars a new and timely perspective on the dynamics of the electoral process and public opinion. 1</p><p>4 0.047449581 <a title="219-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Personalized_Normalization_for_a_Multilingual_Chat_System.html">160 acl-2012-Personalized Normalization for a Multilingual Chat System</a></p>
<p>Author: Ai Ti Aw ; Lian Hau Lee</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes the personalized normalization of a multilingual chat system that supports chatting in user defined short-forms or abbreviations. One of the major challenges for multilingual chat realized through machine translation technology is the normalization of non-standard, self-created short-forms in the chat message to standard words before translation. Due to the lack of training data and the variations of short-forms used among different social communities, it is hard to normalize and translate chat messages if user uses vocabularies outside the training data and create short-forms freely. We develop a personalized chat normalizer for English and integrate it with a multilingual chat system, allowing user to create and use personalized short-forms in multilingual chat. 1</p><p>5 0.046082962 <a title="219-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-ACCURAT_Toolkit_for_Multi-Level_Alignment_and_Information_Extraction_from_Comparable_Corpora.html">1 acl-2012-ACCURAT Toolkit for Multi-Level Alignment and Information Extraction from Comparable Corpora</a></p>
<p>Author: Marcis Pinnis ; Radu Ion ; Dan Stefanescu ; Fangzhong Su ; Inguna Skadina ; Andrejs Vasiljevs ; Bogdan Babych</p><p>Abstract: The lack of parallel corpora and linguistic resources for many languages and domains is one of the major obstacles for the further advancement of automated translation. A possible solution is to exploit comparable corpora (non-parallel bi- or multi-lingual text resources) which are much more widely available than parallel translation data. Our presented toolkit deals with parallel content extraction from comparable corpora. It consists of tools bundled in two workflows: (1) alignment of comparable documents and extraction of parallel sentences and (2) extraction and bilingual mapping of terms and named entities. The toolkit pairs similar bilingual comparable documents and extracts parallel sentences and bilingual terminological and named entity dictionaries from comparable corpora. This demonstration focuses on the English, Latvian, Lithuanian, and Romanian languages.</p><p>6 0.044701364 <a title="219-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Joint_Feature_Selection_in_Distributed_Stochastic_Learning_for_Large-Scale_Discriminative_Training_in_SMT.html">123 acl-2012-Joint Feature Selection in Distributed Stochastic Learning for Large-Scale Discriminative Training in SMT</a></p>

<p>Author: Marco Guerini ; Carlo Strapparava ; Oliviero Stock</p><p>Abstract: In recent years there has been a growing interest in crowdsourcing methodologies to be used in experimental research for NLP tasks. In particular, evaluation of systems and theories about persuasion is difficult to accommodate within existing frameworks. In this paper we present a new cheap and fast methodology that allows fast experiment building and evaluation with fully-automated analysis at a low cost. The central idea is exploiting existing commercial tools for advertising on the web, such as Google AdWords, to measure message impact in an ecological setting. The paper includes a description of the approach, tips for how to use AdWords for scientific research, and results of pilot experiments on the impact of affective text variations which confirm the effectiveness of the approach.</p><p>4 0.57798243 <a title="219-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-Named_Entity_Disambiguation_in_Streaming_Data.html">153 acl-2012-Named Entity Disambiguation in Streaming Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Stephen Tyndall</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents the problem within Hittite and Ancient Near Eastern studies of fragmented and damaged cuneiform texts, and proposes to use well-known text classification metrics, in combination with some facts about the structure of Hittite-language cuneiform texts, to help classify a number offragments of clay cuneiform-script tablets into more complete texts. In particular, Ipropose using Sumerian and Akkadian ideogrammatic signs within Hittite texts to improve the performance of Naive Bayes and Maximum Entropy classifiers. The performance in some cases is improved, and in some cases very much not, suggesting that the variable frequency of occurrence of these ideograms in individual fragments makes considerable difference in the ideal choice for a classification method. Further, complexities of the writing system and the digital availability ofHittite texts complicate the problem.</p><p>6 0.50134307 <a title="219-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-A_Comprehensive_Gold_Standard_for_the_Enron_Organizational_Hierarchy.html">6 acl-2012-A Comprehensive Gold Standard for the Enron Organizational Hierarchy</a></p>

<p>Author: Yukino Baba ; Hisami Suzuki</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of spelling errors that are corrected as you type, vs. those that remain uncorrected. First, we generate naturally occurring online error correction data by logging users’ keystrokes, and by automatically deriving pre- and postcorrection strings from them. We then perform an analysis of this data against the errors that remain in the final text as well as across languages. Our analysis shows a clear distinction between the types of errors that are generated and those that remain uncorrected, as well as across languages.</p><p>3 0.51321185 <a title="219-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Cross-lingual_Parse_Disambiguation_based_on_Semantic_Correspondence.html">63 acl-2012-Cross-lingual Parse Disambiguation based on Semantic Correspondence</a></p>
<p>Author: Lea Frermann ; Francis Bond</p><p>Abstract: We present a system for cross-lingual parse disambiguation, exploiting the assumption that the meaning of a sentence remains unchanged during translation and the fact that different languages have different ambiguities. We simultaneously reduce ambiguity in multiple languages in a fully automatic way. Evaluation shows that the system reliably discards dispreferred parses from the raw parser output, which results in a pre-selection that can speed up manual treebanking.</p><p>4 0.37093946 <a title="219-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Bootstrapping_a_Unified_Model_of_Lexical_and_Phonetic_Acquisition.html">41 acl-2012-Bootstrapping a Unified Model of Lexical and Phonetic Acquisition</a></p>
<p>Author: Micha Elsner ; Sharon Goldwater ; Jacob Eisenstein</p><p>Abstract: ILCC, School of Informatics School of Interactive Computing University of Edinburgh Georgia Institute of Technology Edinburgh, EH8 9AB, UK Atlanta, GA, 30308, USA (a) intended: /ju want w2n/ /want e kUki/ (b) surface: [j@ w a?P w2n] [wan @ kUki] During early language acquisition, infants must learn both a lexicon and a model of phonetics that explains how lexical items can vary in pronunciation—for instance “the” might be realized as [Di] or [D@]. Previous models of acquisition have generally tackled these problems in isolation, yet behavioral evidence suggests infants acquire lexical and phonetic knowledge simultaneously. We present a Bayesian model that clusters together phonetic variants of the same lexical item while learning both a language model over lexical items and a log-linear model of pronunciation variability based on articulatory features. The model is trained on transcribed surface pronunciations, and learns by bootstrapping, without access to the true lexicon. We test the model using a corpus of child-directed speech with realistic phonetic variation and either gold standard or automatically induced word boundaries. In both cases modeling variability improves the accuracy of the learned lexicon over a system that assumes each lexical item has a unique pronunciation.</p><p>5 0.37021521 <a title="219-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-The_Creation_of_a_Corpus_of_English_Metalanguage.html">195 acl-2012-The Creation of a Corpus of English Metalanguage</a></p>
<p>Author: Shomir Wilson</p><p>Abstract: Metalanguage is an essential linguistic mechanism which allows us to communicate explicit information about language itself. However, it has been underexamined in research in language technologies, to the detriment of the performance of systems that could exploit it. This paper describes the creation of the first tagged and delineated corpus of English metalanguage, accompanied by an explicit definition and a rubric for identifying the phenomenon in text. This resource will provide a basis for further studies of metalanguage and enable its utilization in language technologies.</p><p>6 0.36856869 <a title="219-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Unsupervised_Semantic_Role_Induction_with_Global_Role_Ordering.html">209 acl-2012-Unsupervised Semantic Role Induction with Global Role Ordering</a></p>

<p>Author: Einat Minkov ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a joint model for template filling, where the goal is to automatically specify the fields of target relations such as seminar announcements or corporate acquisition events. The approach models mention detection, unification and field extraction in a flexible, feature-rich model that allows for joint modeling of interdependencies at all levels and across fields. Such an approach can, for example, learn likely event durations and the fact that start times should come before end times. While the joint inference space is large, we demonstrate effective learning with a Perceptron-style approach that uses simple, greedy beam decoding.

With the rapid development of social network, people can now easily publish their opinions on the Internet. On the other hand, people can also obtain various opinions from others in a few seconds even though they do not know each other. A typical approach to obtain required information is to use a search engine with some relevant keywords. We thus take the social media and forum as our major data source and aim at collecting specific issues efficiently and effectively in this work. 163 Chen-Ming Wu Institute for Information Industry cmwu@ i i i .org .tw Seng-cho T.

<p>Author: Mark Johnson ; Katherine Demuth ; Michael Frank</p><p>Abstract: This paper uses an unsupervised model of grounded language acquisition to study the role that social cues play in language acquisition. The input to the model consists of (orthographically transcribed) child-directed utterances accompanied by the set of objects present in the non-linguistic context. Each object is annotated by social cues, indicating e.g., whether the caregiver is looking at or touching the object. We show how to model the task of inferring which objects are being talked about (and which words refer to which objects) as standard grammatical inference, and describe PCFG-based unigram models and adaptor grammar-based collocation models for the task. Exploiting social cues improves the performance of all models. Our models learn the relative importance of each social cue jointly with word-object mappings and collocation structure, consis- tent with the idea that children could discover the importance of particular social information sources during word learning.</p><p>5 0.055939492 <a title="6-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Named_Entity_Disambiguation_in_Streaming_Data.html">153 acl-2012-Named Entity Disambiguation in Streaming Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexandre Davis ; Adriano Veloso ; Altigran Soares ; Alberto Laender ; Wagner Meira Jr.</p><p>Abstract: The named entity disambiguation task is to resolve the many-to-many correspondence between ambiguous names and the unique realworld entity. This task can be modeled as a classification problem, provided that positive and negative examples are available for learning binary classifiers. High-quality senseannotated data, however, are hard to be obtained in streaming environments, since the training corpus would have to be constantly updated in order to accomodate the fresh data coming on the stream. On the other hand, few positive examples plus large amounts of unlabeled data may be easily acquired. Producing binary classifiers directly from this data, however, leads to poor disambiguation performance. Thus, we propose to enhance the quality of the classifiers using finer-grained variations of the well-known ExpectationMaximization (EM) algorithm. We conducted a systematic evaluation using Twitter streaming data and the results show that our classifiers are extremely effective, providing improvements ranging from 1% to 20%, when compared to the current state-of-the-art biased SVMs, being more than 120 times faster.</p><p>6 0.052534565 <a title="6-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Exploiting_Latent_Information_to_Predict_Diffusions_of_Novel_Topics_on_Social_Networks.html">86 acl-2012-Exploiting Latent Information to Predict Diffusions of Novel Topics on Social Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Ioannis Konstas ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven method for concept-to-text generation, the task of automatically producing textual output from non-linguistic input. A key insight in our approach is to reduce the tasks of content selection (“what to say”) and surface realization (“how to say”) into a common parsing problem. We define a probabilistic context-free grammar that describes the structure of the input (a corpus of database records and text describing some of them) and represent it compactly as a weighted hypergraph. The hypergraph structure encodes exponentially many derivations, which we rerank discriminatively using local and global features. We propose a novel decoding algorithm for finding the best scoring derivation and generating in this setting. Experimental evaluation on the ATIS domain shows that our model outperforms a competitive discriminative system both using BLEU and in a judgment elicitation study.</p><p>5 0.43758896 <a title="6-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-Ecological_Evaluation_of_Persuasive_Messages_Using_Google_AdWords.html">77 acl-2012-Ecological Evaluation of Persuasive Messages Using Google AdWords</a></p>
<p>Author: Marco Guerini ; Carlo Strapparava ; Oliviero Stock</p><p>Abstract: In recent years there has been a growing interest in crowdsourcing methodologies to be used in experimental research for NLP tasks. In particular, evaluation of systems and theories about persuasion is difficult to accommodate within existing frameworks. In this paper we present a new cheap and fast methodology that allows fast experiment building and evaluation with fully-automated analysis at a low cost. The central idea is exploiting existing commercial tools for advertising on the web, such as Google AdWords, to measure message impact in an ecological setting. The paper includes a description of the approach, tips for how to use AdWords for scientific research, and results of pilot experiments on the impact of affective text variations which confirm the effectiveness of the approach.</p><p>6 0.4011296 <a title="6-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-Exploiting_Social_Information_in_Grounded_Language_Learning_via_Grammatical_Reduction.html">88 acl-2012-Exploiting Social Information in Grounded Language Learning via Grammatical Reduction</a></p>

Our multi-layer generative approach uses both labeled and unlabeled utterances to jointly learn aspects regarding utterance’s target domain (e.g. movies), intention (e.g., finding a movie) along with other semantic units (e.g., movie name). We inject information extracted from unstructured web search query logs as prior information to enhance the generative process of the natural language utterance understanding model. Using utterances from five domains, our approach shows up to 4.5% improvement on domain and dialog act performance over cascaded approach in which each semantic component is learned sequentially and a supervised joint learning model (which requires fully labeled data).</p><p>3 0.50175208 <a title="6-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Combining_Coherence_Models_and_Machine_Translation_Evaluation_Metrics_for_Summarization_Evaluation.html">52 acl-2012-Combining Coherence Models and Machine Translation Evaluation Metrics for Summarization Evaluation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ziheng Lin ; Chang Liu ; Hwee Tou Ng ; Min-Yen Kan</p><p>Abstract: An ideal summarization system should produce summaries that have high content coverage and linguistic quality. Many state-ofthe-art summarization systems focus on content coverage by extracting content-dense sentences from source articles. A current research focus is to process these sentences so that they read fluently as a whole. The current AESOP task encourages research on evaluating summaries on content, readability, and overall responsiveness. In this work, we adapt a machine translation metric to measure content coverage, apply an enhanced discourse coherence model to evaluate summary readability, and combine both in a trained regression model to evaluate overall responsiveness. The results show significantly improved performance over AESOP 2011 submitted metrics.</p><p>4 0.42862606 <a title="6-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-UWN%3A_A_Large_Multilingual_Lexical_Knowledge_Base.html">206 acl-2012-UWN: A Large Multilingual Lexical Knowledge Base</a></p>

We additionally introduce extensions to cover lexical relationships, frame-semantic knowledge, and language data.

<p>Author: Yang Feng ; Dongdong Zhang ; Mu Li ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: We present a hierarchical chunk-to-string translation model, which can be seen as a compromise between the hierarchical phrasebased model and the tree-to-string model, to combine the merits of the two models. With the help of shallow parsing, our model learns rules consisting of words and chunks and meanwhile introduce syntax cohesion. Under the weighed synchronous context-free grammar defined by these rules, our model searches for the best translation derivation and yields target translation simultaneously. Our experiments show that our model significantly outperforms the hierarchical phrasebased model and the tree-to-string model on English-Chinese Translation tasks.</p><p>6 0.4060739 <a title="6-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Finding_Bursty_Topics_from_Microblogs.html">98 acl-2012-Finding Bursty Topics from Microblogs</a></p>

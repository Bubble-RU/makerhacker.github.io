<p>Author: Einat Minkov ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a joint model for template filling, where the goal is to automatically specify the fields of target relations such as seminar announcements or corporate acquisition events. The approach models mention detection, unification and field extraction in a flexible, feature-rich model that allows for joint modeling of interdependencies at all levels and across fields. Such an approach can, for example, learn likely event durations and the fact that start times should come before end times. While the joint inference space is large, we demonstrate effective learning with a Perceptron-style approach that uses simple, greedy beam decoding. Empirical results in two benchmark domains demonstrate consistently strong performance on both mention de- tection and template filling tasks.</p><p>3 0.14647479 <a title="57-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Higher-order_Constituent_Parsing_and_Parser_Combination.html">109 acl-2012-Higher-order Constituent Parsing and Parser Combination</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiao Chen ; Chunyu Kit</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a higher-order model for constituent parsing aimed at utilizing more local structural context to decide the score of a grammar rule instance in a parse tree. Experiments on English and Chinese treebanks confirm its advantage over its first-order version. It achieves its best F1 scores of 91.86% and 85.58% on the two languages, respectively, and further pushes them to 92.80% and 85.60% via combination with other highperformance parsers.</p><p>4 0.13766129 <a title="57-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-NiuTrans%3A_An_Open_Source_Toolkit_for_Phrase-based_and_Syntax-based_Machine_Translation.html">155 acl-2012-NiuTrans: An Open Source Toolkit for Phrase-based and Syntax-based Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Xiao ; Jingbo Zhu ; Hao Zhang ; Qiang Li</p><p>Abstract: We present a new open source toolkit for phrase-based and syntax-based machine translation. The toolkit supports several state-of-the-art models developed in statistical machine translation, including the phrase-based model, the hierachical phrase-based model, and various syntaxbased models. The key innovation provided by the toolkit is that the decoder can work with various grammars and offers different choices of decoding algrithms, such as phrase-based decoding, decoding as parsing/tree-parsing and forest-based decoding. Moreover, several useful utilities were distributed with the toolkit, including a discriminative reordering model, a simple and fast language model, and an implementation of minimum error rate training for weight tuning. 1</p><p>5 0.12596744 <a title="57-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Joint_Feature_Selection_in_Distributed_Stochastic_Learning_for_Large-Scale_Discriminative_Training_in_SMT.html">123 acl-2012-Joint Feature Selection in Distributed Stochastic Learning for Large-Scale Discriminative Training in SMT</a></p>
<p>Author: Patrick Simianer ; Stefan Riezler ; Chris Dyer</p><p>Abstract: With a few exceptions, discriminative training in statistical machine translation (SMT) has been content with tuning weights for large feature sets on small development data. Evidence from machine learning indicates that increasing the training sample size results in better prediction. The goal of this paper is to show that this common wisdom can also be brought to bear upon SMT. We deploy local features for SCFG-based SMT that can be read off from rules at runtime, and present a learning algorithm that applies ‘1/‘2 regularization for joint feature selection over distributed stochastic learning processes.

This paper evaluates two empirical strategies to integrate multiword units in a real constituency parsing context and shows that the results are not as promising as has sometimes been suggested. Firstly, we show that pregrouping multiword expressions before parsing with a state-of-the-art recognizer improves multiword recognition accuracy and unlabeled attachment score. However, it has no statistically significant impact in terms of F-score as incorrect multiword expression recognition has important side effects on parsing. Secondly, integrating multiword expressions in the parser grammar followed by a reranker specific to such expressions slightly improves all evaluation metrics.</p><p>6 0.51878887 <a title="57-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-Automatic_Event_Extraction_with_Structured_Preference_Modeling.html">33 acl-2012-Automatic Event Extraction with Structured Preference Modeling</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiaodong He ; Li Deng</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new discriminative training method in constructing phrase and lexicon translation models. In order to reliably learn a myriad of parameters in these models, we propose an expected BLEU score-based utility function with KL regularization as the objective, and train the models on a large parallel dataset. For training, we derive growth transformations for phrase and lexicon translation probabilities to iteratively improve the objective. The proposed method, evaluated on the Europarl German-to-English dataset, leads to a 1.1 BLEU point improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline translation system. In IWSLT 201 1 Benchmark, our system using the proposed method achieves the best Chinese-to-English translation result on the task of translating TED talks.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.84145421 <a title="57-lda-2" href="./acl-2012-Concept-to-text_Generation_via_Discriminative_Reranking.html">57 acl-2012-Concept-to-text Generation via Discriminative Reranking</a></p>

Our approach is to measure the impact of these nonisomorphic dependency structures to be used for string-to-dependency translation. Besides using traditional dependency parsers, we also use the dependency structures transformed from PCFG trees and predicate-argument structures (PASs) which are generated by an HPSG parser and a CCG parser. The experiments on Chinese-to-English translation show that the HPSG parser’s PASs achieved the best dependency and translation accuracies. 1</p><p>4 0.7544775 <a title="57-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Learning_Translation_Consensus_with_Structured_Label_Propagation.html">131 acl-2012-Learning Translation Consensus with Structured Label Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Shujie Liu ; Chi-Ho Li ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the issue for learning better translation consensus in machine translation (MT) research, and explore the search of translation consensus from similar, rather than the same, source sentences or their spans. Unlike previous work on this topic, we formulate the problem as structured labeling over a much smaller graph, and we propose a novel structured label propagation for the task. We convert such graph-based translation consensus from similar source strings into useful features both for n-best output reranking and for decoding algorithm. Experimental results show that, our method can significantly improve machine translation performance on both IWSLT and NIST data, compared with a state-ofthe-art baseline. 1</p><p>5 0.74448788 <a title="57-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-NiuTrans%3A_An_Open_Source_Toolkit_for_Phrase-based_and_Syntax-based_Machine_Translation.html">155 acl-2012-NiuTrans: An Open Source Toolkit for Phrase-based and Syntax-based Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Xiao ; Jingbo Zhu ; Hao Zhang ; Qiang Li</p><p>Abstract: We present a new open source toolkit for phrase-based and syntax-based machine translation. The toolkit supports several state-of-the-art models developed in statistical machine translation, including the phrase-based model, the hierachical phrase-based model, and various syntaxbased models. The key innovation provided by the toolkit is that the decoder can work with various grammars and offers different choices of decoding algrithms, such as phrase-based decoding, decoding as parsing/tree-parsing and forest-based decoding. Moreover, several useful utilities were distributed with the toolkit, including a discriminative reordering model, a simple and fast language model, and an implementation of minimum error rate training for weight tuning. 1</p><p>6 0.73223197 <a title="57-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Translation_Model_Size_Reduction_for_Hierarchical_Phrase-based_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">204 acl-2012-Translation Model Size Reduction for Hierarchical Phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Patrick Simianer ; Stefan Riezler ; Chris Dyer</p><p>Abstract: With a few exceptions, discriminative training in statistical machine translation (SMT) has been content with tuning weights for large feature sets on small development data. Evidence from machine learning indicates that increasing the training sample size results in better prediction. The goal of this paper is to show that this common wisdom can also be brought to bear upon SMT. We deploy local features for SCFG-based SMT that can be read off from rules at runtime, and present a learning algorithm that applies ‘1/‘2 regularization for joint feature selection over distributed stochastic learning processes. We present experiments on learning on 1.5 million training sentences, and show significant improvements over tuning discriminative models on small development sets.</p><p>3 0.12656651 <a title="94-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Sentence_Dependency_Tagging_in_Online_Question_Answering_Forums.html">177 acl-2012-Sentence Dependency Tagging in Online Question Answering Forums</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhonghua Qu ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: Online forums are becoming a popular resource in the state of the art question answering (QA) systems. Because of its nature as an online community, it contains more updated knowledge than other places. However, going through tedious and redundant posts to look for answers could be very time consuming. Most prior work focused on extracting only question answering sentences from user conversations. In this paper, we introduce the task of sentence dependency tagging. Finding dependency structure can not only help find answer quickly but also allow users to trace back how the answer is concluded through user conversations. We use linear-chain conditional random fields (CRF) for sentence type tagging, and a 2D CRF to label the dependency relation between sentences. Our experimental results show that our proposed approach performs well for sentence dependency tagging. This dependency information can benefit other tasks such as thread ranking and answer summarization in online forums.</p><p>4 0.12171654 <a title="94-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Incremental_Joint_Approach_to_Word_Segmentation%2C_POS_Tagging%2C_and_Dependency_Parsing_in_Chinese.html">119 acl-2012-Incremental Joint Approach to Word Segmentation, POS Tagging, and Dependency Parsing in Chinese</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun Hatori ; Takuya Matsuzaki ; Yusuke Miyao ; Jun'ichi Tsujii</p><p>Abstract: We propose the first joint model for word segmentation, POS tagging, and dependency parsing for Chinese. Based on an extension of the incremental joint model for POS tagging and dependency parsing (Hatori et al., 2011), we propose an efficient character-based decoding method that can combine features from state-of-the-art segmentation, POS tagging, and dependency parsing models. We also describe our method to align comparable states in the beam, and how we can combine features of different characteristics in our incremental framework. In experiments using the Chinese Treebank (CTB), we show that the accuracies of the three tasks can be improved significantly over the baseline models, particularly by 0.6% for POS tagging and 2.4% for dependency parsing. We also perform comparison experiments with the partially joint models.</p><p>5 0.12131294 <a title="94-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Unsupervized_Word_Segmentation%3A_the_Case_for_Mandarin_Chinese.html">210 acl-2012-Unsupervized Word Segmentation: the Case for Mandarin Chinese</a></p>

The problem was motivated by an attempt to collect a large amount of linguistic data for non-major languages from the web. The problem is formulated in terms of obtaining the minimum description length of a text, and the proposed solution finds the segments and their languages through dynamic programming. Empirical results demonstrating the potential of this approach are presented for experiments using texts taken from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Wikipedia, covering more than 200 languages.</p><p>4 0.6612519 <a title="94-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-Incremental_Joint_Approach_to_Word_Segmentation%2C_POS_Tagging%2C_and_Dependency_Parsing_in_Chinese.html">119 acl-2012-Incremental Joint Approach to Word Segmentation, POS Tagging, and Dependency Parsing in Chinese</a></p>

<p>Author: Qiuye Zhao ; Mitch Marcus</p><p>Abstract: We show for both English POS tagging and Chinese word segmentation that with proper representation, large number of deterministic constraints can be learned from training examples, and these are useful in constraining probabilistic inference. For tagging, learned constraints are directly used to constrain Viterbi decoding. For segmentation, character-based tagging constraints can be learned with the same templates. However, they are better applied to a word-based model, thus an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation is proposed. For both problems, the corresponding constrained solutions have advantages in both efficiency and accuracy. 1 introduction In recent work, interesting results are reported for applications of integer linear programming (ILP) such as semantic role labeling (SRL) (Roth and Yih, 2005), dependency parsing (Martins et al., 2009) and so on. In an ILP formulation, ’non-local’ deterministic constraints on output structures can be naturally incorporated, such as ”a verb cannot take two subject arguments” for SRL, and the projectivity constraint for dependency parsing. In contrast to probabilistic constraints that are estimated from training examples, this type of constraint is usually hand-written reflecting one’s linguistic knowledge. Dynamic programming techniques based on Markov assumptions, such as Viterbi decoding, cannot handle those ’non-local’ constraints as discussed above. However, it is possible to constrain Viterbi 1054 decoding by ’local’ constraints, e.g. ”assign label t to word w” for POS tagging. This type of constraint may come from human input solicited in interactive inference procedure (Kristjansson et al., 2004). In this work, we explore deterministic constraints for two fundamental NLP problems, English POS tagging and Chinese word segmentation. We show by experiments that, with proper representation, large number of deterministic constraints can be learned automatically from training data, which can then be used to constrain probabilistic inference. For POS tagging, the learned constraints are directly used to constrain Viterbi decoding. The corresponding constrained tagger is 10 times faster than searching in a raw space pruned with beam-width 5. Tagging accuracy is moderately improved as well. For Chinese word segmentation (CWS), which can be formulated as character tagging, analogous constraints can be learned with the same templates as English POS tagging. High-quality constraints can be learned with respect to a special tagset, however, with this tagset, the best segmentation accuracy is hard to achieve. Therefore, these character-based constraints are not directly used for determining predictions as in English POS tagging. We propose an ILP formulation of the CWS problem. By adopting this ILP formulation, segmentation F-measure is increased from 0.968 to 0.974, as compared to Viterbi decoding with the same feature set. Moreover, the learned constraints can be applied to reduce the number of possible words over a character sequence, i.e. to reduce the number of variables to set. This reduction of problem size immediately speeds up an ILP solver by more than 100 times.

Let (+N −V) =Noun, (−N +V) =Verb, (+N, +V) =Adjective, aonudn (−N, −V) =preposition. A word occurring in betw(e−eNn a preceding wosoitrdio nth.e Aand w a following wgo irnd of always bears the feature +N. On the other hand, consider the annotation guideline of English Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) instead. Part-of-speech (POS) tags are used to categorize words, for example, the POS tag VBG tags verbal gerunds, NNS tags nominal plurals, DT tags determiners and so on. Following this POS representation, there are as many as 10 possible POS tags that may occur in between the–of, as estimated from the WSJ corpus of Penn Treebank. , 2.1.1 Templates of deterministic constraints , To explore determinacy in the distribution of POS tags in Penn Treebank, we need to consider that a POS tag marks the basic syntactic category of a word as well as its morphological inflection. A constraint that may determine the POS category should reflect both the context and the morphological feature of the corresponding word. The practical difficulty in representing such deterministic constraints is that we do not have a perfect mechanism to analyze morphological features of a word. Endings or prefixes of English words do not deterministically mark their morphological inflections. We propose to compute the morph feature of a word as the set of all of its possible tags, i.e. all tag types that are assigned to the word in training data. Furthermore, we approximate unknown words in testing data by rare words in training data. For a word that occurs less than 5 times in the training corpus, we compute its morph feature as its last two characters, which is also conjoined with binary features indicating whether the rare word contains digits, hyphens or upper-case characters respectively. See examples of morph features in Table 1. We consider bigram and trigram templates for generating potentially deterministic constraints. Let denote the ith word relative to the current word w0; and mi denote the morph feature of wi. A wi 1055 w(fr0e=qtruaednets)(set of pmos0s=ib{lNeN taSg,s V oBfZ th}e word) w0=t(imraere-s)hares(thme0 l=as{t- tewso, c HhYaPraHcEteNrs}. .)

Each constraint is also con- joined with w0 or m0, as described in Table 2. 2.1.2 Learning of deterministic constraints In the above section, we explore templates for potentially deterministic constraints that may determine POS category. With respect to a training corpus, if a constraint C relative to w0 ’always’ assigns a certain POS category t∗ to w0 in its context, i.e. > thr, and this constraint occurs more than a cutoff number, we consider it as a deterministic constraint. The threshold thr is a real number just under 1.0 and the cutoff number is empirically set to 5 in our experiments. counctou(Cnt∧(tC0)=t∗) 2.1.3 Decoding of deterministic constraints By the above definition, the constraint of w−1 = the, m0 = {NNS VBZ } and w1 = of is deterministic. It det=er{mNiNneSs, ,the V BPZO}S category of w0 to be NNS. There are at least two ways of decoding these constraints during POS tagging. Take the word trades for example, whose morph feature is {NNS, VBZ}. fOonre e xaaltemrnplaet,ive w hiso sthea tm as long as rtera dises { occurs Zb e}-. tween the-of, it is tagged with NNS. The second alternative is that the tag decision is made only if all deterministic constraints relative to this occurrence , of trades agree on the same tag. Both ways of decoding are purely rule-based and involve no probabilistic inference. In favor of a higher precision, we adopt the latter one in our experiments. tTchoe/nDscrotTamwSpci&lnoeLmxpd;/–fiulenbtaxp/i–cloufntg/aNpnlOci(amgnw/1–tOhNTpe(lanS+Ti&/m2cNL)lubTdaien2ls/)IoVNuBtlZamwn.1=ic2l3ud,ems.2=1 Table 3: Comparison of raw input and constrained input. 2.2 Search in a constrained space Following most previous work, we consider POS tagging as a sequence classification problem and de- compose the overall sequence scnore over the linear structure, i.e. ˆt =t∈atraggGmENa(xw)Xi=1score(ti) where function tagGEN maps input seXntence w = w1...wn to the set of all tag sequences that are of length n. If a POS tagger takes raw input only, i.e. for every word, the number of possible tags is a constant T, the space of tagGEN is as large as Tn. On the other hand, if we decode deterministic constraints first be- fore a probabilistic search, i.e. for some words, the number of possible tags is reduced to 1, the search space is reduced to Tm, where m is the number of (unconstrained) words that are not subject to any deterministic constraints. Viterbi algorithm is widely used for tagging, and runs in O(nT2) when searching in an unconstrained space. On the other hand, consider searching in a constrained space. Suppose that among the m unconstrained words, m1 of them follow a word that has been tagged by deterministic constraints and m2 (=m-m1) of them follow another unconstrained word. Viterbi decoder runs in O(m1T + m2T2) while searching in such a constrained space. The example in Table 3 shows raw and constrained input with respect to a typical input sentence. Lookahead features The score of tag predictions are usually computed in a high-dimensional feature space. We adopt the basic feature set used in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) and (Collins, 2002). Moreover, when deterministic constraints have applied to contextual words of w0, it is also possible to include some lookahead feature templates, such as: t0&t1; , t0&t1;&t2; , and t−1&t0;&t1; where ti represents the tag of the ith word relative 1056 to the current word w0. As discussed in (Shen et al., 2007), categorical information of neighbouring words on both sides of w0 help resolve POS ambiguity of w0. In (Shen et al., 2007), lookahead features may be available for use during decoding since searching is bidirectional instead of left-to-right as in Viterbi decoding. In this work, deterministic constraints are decoded before the application of probabilistic models, therefore lookahead features are made available during Viterbi decoding. 3 Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS) 3.1 Word segmentation as character tagging Considering the ambiguity problem that a Chinese character may appear in any relative position in a word and the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem that it is impossible to observe all words in training data, CWS is widely formulated as a character tagging problem (Xue, 2003). A character-based CWS decoder is to find the highest scoring tag sequence tˆ over the input character sequence c, i.e. Xn tˆ =t∈ atraggGmEaNx(c)Xi=1score(ti) . This is the same formulation as POS tagging. The Viterbi algorithm is also widely used for decoding. The tag of each character represents its relative position in a word. Two popular tagsets include 1) IB: where B tags the beginning of a word and I all other positions; and 2) BMES: where B, M and E represent the beginning, middle and end of a multicharacter word respectively, and S tags a singlecharacter word. For example, after decoding with BMES, 4 consecutive characters associated with the tag sequence BMME compose a word. However, after decoding with IB, characters associated with BIII may compose a word if the following tag is B or only form part of a word if the following tag is I. Even though character tagging accuracy is higher with tagset IB, tagset BMES is more popular in use since better performance of the original problem CWS can be achieved by this tagset. Character-based feature templates We adopt the ’non-lexical-target’ feature templates in (Jiang et al., 2008a). Let ci denote the ith character relative to the current character c0 and t0 denote the tag assigned to c0. The following templates are used: ci&t0; (i=-2...2), cici+1&t0; (i=-2...1) and c−1c1&t0.; Character-based deterministic constraints We can use the same templates as described in Table 2 to generate potentially deterministic constraints for CWS character tagging, except that there are no morph features computed for Chinese characters. As we will show with experimental results in Section 5.2, useful deterministic constraints for CWS can be learned with tagset IB but not with tagset BMES. It is interesting but not surprising to notice, again, that the determinacy of a problem is sensitive to its representation. Since it is hard to achieve the best segmentations with tagset IB, we propose an indirect way to use these constraints in the following section, instead of applying these constraints as straightforwardly as in English POS tagging. 3.2 Word-based word segmentation A word-based CWS decoder finds the highest scoring segmentation sequence wˆ that is composed by the input character sequence c, i.e. wˆ =w∈arseggGmEaNx(c)Xi|=w1|score(wi) . where function segGEN maps character sequence c to the set of all possible segmentations of c. For example, w = (c1. .cl1 ) ...(cn−lk+1 ...cn) represents a segmentation of k words and the lengths of the first and last word are l1 and lk respectively. In early work, rule-based models find words one by one based on heuristics such as forward maximum match (Sproat et al., 1996). Exact search is possible with a Viterbi-style algorithm, but beamsearch decoding is more popular as used in (Zhang and Clark, 2007) and (Jiang et al., 2008a). We propose an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation of word segmentation, which is naturally viewed as a word-based model for CWS. Character-based deterministic constraints, as discussed in Section 3.1, can be easily applied. 3.3 ILP formulation of CWS Given a character sequence c=c1 ...cn, there are s(= n(n + 1)/2) possible words that are contiguous subsets of c, i.e. w1, ..., ws ⊆ c. Our goal is to find 1057 Table 4: Comparison of raw input and constrained input. an optimal solution x = ...xs that maximizes x1 Xs Xscore(wi) · xi, subject to Xi= X1 (1) X xi = 1, ∀c ∈ c; (2) ix:Xic∈∈wi {0,1},1 ≤i≤s The boolean value of xi, as guaranteed by constraint (2), indicates whether wi is selected in the segmentation solution or not. Constraint (1) requires every character to be included in exactly one selected word, thus guarantees a proper segmentation of the whole sequence. This resembles the ILP formulation of the set cover problem, though the first con- straint is different. Take n = 2 for example, i.e. c = c1c2, the set of possible words is {c1, c2 , c1c2}, i.e. s = |x| = t3 o. T pohesrseib are only t iwso { possible soli.uet.ion ss = subject t o3 .co Tnhsetrreain artse (1) yan tdw (2), x = 1 s1o0giving an output set {c1, c2}, or x = 001 giving an output asent {c1c2}. tTphuet efficiency o.f solving this problem depends on the number of possible words (contiguous subsets) over a character sequence, i.e. the number of variables in x. So as to reduce |x|, we apply determiniasbtlice sc ionn xs.tra Sinots a predicting I |xB| tags first, w dehtiecrhm are learned as described in Section 3.1. Possible words are generated with respect to the partially tagged character sequence. A character tagged with B always occurs at the beginning of a possible word. Table 4 illustrates the constrained and raw input with respect to a typical character sequence. 3.4 Character- and word-based features As studied in previous work, word-based feature templates usually include the word itself, sub-words contained in the word, contextual characters/words and so on. It has been shown that combining the use of character- and word-based features helps improve performance. However, in the character tag- ging formulation, word-based features are non-local. To incorporate these non-local features and make the search tractable, various efforts have been made. For example, Jiang et al. (2008a) combine different levels of knowledge in an outside linear model of a twolayer cascaded model; Jiang et al. (2008b) uses the forest re-ranking technique (Huang, 2008); and in (Kruengkrai et al., 2009), only known words in vocabulary are included in the hybrid lattice consisting of both character- and word-level nodes. We propose to incorporate character-based features in word-based models. Consider a characterbased feature function φ(c, t,c) that maps a character-tag pair to a high-dimensional feature space, with respect to an input character sequence c. For a possible word over c of length l , wi = ci0 ...ci0+l−1, tag each character cij in this word with a character-based tag tij . Character-based features of wi can be computed as {φ(cij , tij , c) |0 ≤ j < l}.

<p>Author: Andreas Maletti ; Joost Engelfriet</p><p>Abstract: Recently, it was shown (KUHLMANN, SATTA: Tree-adjoining grammars are not closed under strong lexicalization. Comput. Linguist., 2012) that finitely ambiguous tree adjoining grammars cannot be transformed into a normal form (preserving the generated tree language), in which each production contains a lexical symbol. A more powerful model, the simple context-free tree grammar, admits such a normal form. It can be effectively constructed and the maximal rank of the nonterminals only increases by 1. Thus, simple context-free tree grammars strongly lexicalize tree adjoining grammars and themselves.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.90264189 <a title="94-lda-2" href="./acl-2012-Fast_Online_Training_with_Frequency-Adaptive_Learning_Rates_for_Chinese_Word_Segmentation_and_New_Word_Detection.html">94 acl-2012-Fast Online Training with Frequency-Adaptive Learning Rates for Chinese Word Segmentation and New Word Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xu Sun ; Houfeng Wang ; Wenjie Li</p><p>Abstract: We present a joint model for Chinese word segmentation and new word detection. We present high dimensional new features, including word-based features and enriched edge (label-transition) features, for the joint modeling. As we know, training a word segmentation system on large-scale datasets is already costly. In our case, adding high dimensional new features will further slow down the training speed. To solve this problem, we propose a new training method, adaptive online gradient descent based on feature frequency information, for very fast online training of the parameters, even given large-scale datasets with high dimensional features. Compared with existing training methods, our training method is an order magnitude faster in terms of training time, and can achieve equal or even higher accuracies. The proposed fast training method is a general purpose optimization method, and it is not limited in the specific task discussed in this paper.</p><p>3 0.87491429 <a title="94-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Head-Driven_Hierarchical_Phrase-based_Translation.html">105 acl-2012-Head-Driven Hierarchical Phrase-based Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Einat Minkov ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a joint model for template filling, where the goal is to automatically specify the fields of target relations such as seminar announcements or corporate acquisition events. The approach models mention detection, unification and field extraction in a flexible, feature-rich model that allows for joint modeling of interdependencies at all levels and across fields. Such an approach can, for example, learn likely event durations and the fact that start times should come before end times. While the joint inference space is large, we demonstrate effective learning with a Perceptron-style approach that uses simple, greedy beam decoding. Empirical results in two benchmark domains demonstrate consistently strong performance on both mention de- tection and template filling tasks.</p><p>5 0.72149485 <a title="94-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Capturing_Paradigmatic_and_Syntagmatic_Lexical_Relations%3A_Towards_Accurate_Chinese_Part-of-Speech_Tagging.html">45 acl-2012-Capturing Paradigmatic and Syntagmatic Lexical Relations: Towards Accurate Chinese Part-of-Speech Tagging</a></p>
<p>Author: Weiwei Sun ; Hans Uszkoreit</p><p>Abstract: From the perspective of structural linguistics, we explore paradigmatic and syntagmatic lexical relations for Chinese POS tagging, an important and challenging task for Chinese language processing. Paradigmatic lexical relations are explicitly captured by word clustering on large-scale unlabeled data and are used to design new features to enhance a discriminative tagger. Syntagmatic lexical relations are implicitly captured by constituent parsing and are utilized via system combination. Experiments on the Penn Chinese Treebank demonstrate the importance of both paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations. Our linguistically motivated approaches yield a relative error reduction of 18% in total over a stateof-the-art baseline.</p><p>6 0.70795971 <a title="94-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Incremental_Joint_Approach_to_Word_Segmentation%2C_POS_Tagging%2C_and_Dependency_Parsing_in_Chinese.html">119 acl-2012-Incremental Joint Approach to Word Segmentation, POS Tagging, and Dependency Parsing in Chinese</a></p>

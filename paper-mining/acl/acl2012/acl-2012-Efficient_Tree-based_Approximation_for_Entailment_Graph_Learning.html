</p><p>11 Since finding the optimal set of edges respecting transitivity is NP-hard, they employed Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to find the exact solution. [sent-30, score-0.4]

</p><p>14 Despite this progress, finding the exact solution remains NP-hard the authors themselves report they were unable to solve some graphs of rather moderate size and that the coverage of their method is limited. [sent-35, score-0.2]

</p><p>16 To that end, we first (Section 3) conjecture and empirically show that entailment graphs exhibit a “tree-like” property, i. [sent-44, score-0.549]
</p><p>17 Then, we present in Section 4 our iterative approximation algorithm, where in each iteration a node is removed and re-attached back to the graph in a locally-optimal way. [sent-47, score-0.444]
</p><p>18 Combining this scheme with our conjecture about the graph structure enables a linear algorithm for node re-attachment. [sent-48, score-0.431]
</p><p>19 Section 5 shows empirically that this algorithm is by orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art exact algorithm, and that though an optimal solution is not guaranteed, the area under the precision-recall curve drops by merely a point. [sent-49, score-0.199]
</p><p>20 Second, we exploit this assumption to develop a polynomial approximation algorithm for learning entailment graphs that can scale to much larger graphs than in the past. [sent-51, score-0.762]
</p><p>21 Finally, we note that learning entailment graphs bears strong similarities to related tasks such as Taxonomy Induction (Snow et al. [sent-52, score-0.504]
</p><p>22 2  Background  Until recently, work on learning entailment rules between predicates considered each rule independently of others and did not exploit global dependencies. [sent-54, score-0.517]

[sent-76, score-1.237]
</p><p>30 Since ILP is NP-hard, applying an ILP solver directly does not scale well because the number of variables is O(| V |2) and the number of constraints is O( |aVb |l3e)s. [sent-77, score-0.183]

</p><p>32 , 2011), they proposed a method that efficiently decomposes the graph into smaller components and applies an ILP solver on each component separately using a cutting-plane  ≤  procedure (Riedel and Clarke, 2006). [sent-81, score-0.41]
</p><p>33 When the graph does not decompose into sufficiently small components, and the weights generate many violations of transitivity, solving Max-Trans-Graph becomes intractable. [sent-83, score-0.372]
</p><p>34 To address this problem, we present in this paper a method for approximating the optimal set of edges within each component and show that it is much more efficient and scalable both theoretically and empirically. [sent-84, score-0.305]
</p><p>35 Given a pair of terms, a small graph is constructed and constraints are imposed on the graph structure. [sent-86, score-0.651]
</p><p>36 Another approximation method that violates transitivity constraints is LP relaxation (Martins et al. [sent-89, score-0.314]
</p><p>37 In LP relaxation, the constraint xij ∈ {0, 1}  is replaced by 0 ≤ xij ≤ 1, transforming th∈e probliesm re pfrlaomce an yIL 0P ≤ ≤to x a L≤in 1ea,r t Program (LP), w prhoicbhis polynomial. [sent-91, score-0.356]
</p><p>38 An LP solver is then applied on the problem, and variables xij that are assigned a fractional value are rounded to their nearest integer and so many violations of transitivity easily occur. [sent-92, score-0.481]
</p><p>39 The solution when applying LP relaxation is not a transitive graph, but nevertheless we show for comparison in Section 5 that our method is much faster. [sent-93, score-0.195]
</p><p>40 3  Forest-reducible Graphs  The entailment relation, described by entailment graphs, is typically from a “semantically-specific” predicate to a more “general” one. [sent-95, score-0.722]
</p><p>41 Thus, intuitively, the topology of an entailment graph is expected to be “tree-like”. [sent-96, score-0.646]
</p><p>42 This property of entailment graphs is an interesting topological observation on its own, but also enables the  efficient approximation algorithm of Section 4. [sent-98, score-0.639]

</p><p>46 The entailment graph in Figure 1a (subgraph from the data set described in Section 5) is clearly not a directed forest it contains a cycle of size two comprising the nodes ‘X common in Y’ and ‘X frequent in Y’, and in addition the node ‘X be epidemic in Y’ has 3 parents.

</p><p>56 We say a graph is a forest-reducible graph (FRG) if all nodes in its reduced form have no more than one parent. [sent-116, score-0.74]
</p><p>57 The intuition behind this assumption is that the predicate on the left-hand-side of a unidirectional entailment rule has a more specific meaning than the one on the right-hand-side. [sent-118, score-0.375]
</p><p>58 Accordingly, the reduced graph in Figure 1c is an FRG. [sent-120, score-0.355]
</p><p>59 We note that this is not always the case: for example, the entailment graph in Figure 2 is not an FRG, because ‘X annex Y’ entails both ‘Y be part of X’ and ‘X invade Y’, while the latter two do not entail one another. [sent-121, score-0.695]
</p><p>60 Consequently, a natural variant of the Max-Trans-Graph problem is to restrict the required output graph of the optimiza-  tion problem (1) to an FRG. [sent-123, score-0.299]
</p><p>61 We sampled 7 gold standard entailment graphs from the data set 120 described in Section 5, manually transformed them into FRGs by deleting a minimal number of edges, and measured recall over the set of edges in each graph (precision is naturally 1. [sent-126, score-0.968]

</p><p>66 Re-attaching a node v is performed by removing v from the graph and connecting it back with a better set of edges, while maintaining the constraint that it is an FRG. [sent-143, score-0.412]
</p><p>67 This is done by considering all possible edges from/to the other graph nodes and choosing  (a)c v (bd)1 v dc2 … (b’)…cd v … ( cr)1 … v r…2 r…3 Figure 3: (a) Inserting v into a component c ∈ Vred. [sent-144, score-0.584]

</p><p>70 Clearly, at each re-attachment the value of the objective function cannot decrease, since the optimization algorithm considers the previous graph as one of its candidate solutions. [sent-152, score-0.362]
</p><p>71 A node tchhailtd dirse nno itn a descendant of c can not become a child of v, since this would create a new path from that node to c and would require by transitivity to add a  corresponding directed edge to c (but all graph edges not connecting v are fixed). [sent-167, score-1.005]
</p><p>72 Thus, this case requires adding in G edges from v to all nodes in c and tqhueiirre ancestors, na Gnd e adlgseos f forro mea vch t new nchodildes so ifn v, adnednoted by d ∈ Vred, we add edges from all nodes in ndo oatendd tbhyei dr d ∈es Vcendants to v. [sent-169, score-0.502]

<p>Author: Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan ; Meni Adler ; Jacob Goldberger</p><p>Abstract: Learning entailment rules is fundamental in many semantic-inference applications and has been an active field of research in recent years. In this paper we address the problem of learning transitive graphs that describe entailment rules between predicates (termed entailment graphs).

However, evaluating such resources has turned out to be a non-trivial task, slowing progress in the field. In this paper, we suggest a framework for evaluating inference-rule resources. Our framework simplifies a previously proposed “instance-based evaluation” method that involved substantial annotator training, making it suitable for crowdsourcing. We show that our method produces a large amount of annotations with high inter-annotator agreement for a low cost at a short period of time, without requiring training expert annotators.</p><p>4 0.15490645 <a title="80-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Detecting_Semantic_Equivalence_and_Information_Disparity_in_Cross-lingual_Documents.html">72 acl-2012-Detecting Semantic Equivalence and Information Disparity in Cross-lingual Documents</a></p>

<p>Author: Bevan Jones ; Mark Johnson ; Sharon Goldwater</p><p>Abstract: Many semantic parsing models use tree transformations to map between natural language and meaning representation. However, while tree transformations are central to several state-of-the-art approaches, little use has been made of the rich literature on tree automata. This paper makes the connection concrete with a tree transducer based semantic parsing model and suggests that other models can be interpreted in a similar framework, increasing the generality of their contributions. In particular, this paper further introduces a variational Bayesian inference algorithm that is applicable to a wide class of tree transducers, producing state-of-the-art semantic parsing results while remaining applicable to any domain employing probabilistic tree transducers.</p><p>5 0.47914472 <a title="80-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Authorship_Attribution_with_Author-aware_Topic_Models.html">31 acl-2012-Authorship Attribution with Author-aware Topic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Yanir Seroussi ; Fabian Bohnert ; Ingrid Zukerman</p><p>Abstract: Authorship attribution deals with identifying the authors of anonymous texts. Building on our earlier finding that the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model can be used to improve authorship attribution accuracy, we show that employing a previously-suggested Author-Topic (AT) model outperforms LDA when applied to scenarios with many authors. In addition, we define a model that combines LDA and AT by representing authors and documents over two disjoint topic sets, and show that our model outperforms LDA, AT and support vector machines on datasets with many authors.</p><p>6 0.47707841 <a title="80-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Estimating_Compact_Yet_Rich_Tree_Insertion_Grammars.html">84 acl-2012-Estimating Compact Yet Rich Tree Insertion Grammars</a></p>

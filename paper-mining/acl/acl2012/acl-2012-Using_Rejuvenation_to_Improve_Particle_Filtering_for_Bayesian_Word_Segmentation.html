</p><p>2 of Computing  Macquarie University Sydney, Australia Abstract We present a novel extension to a recently proposed incremental learning algorithm for the word segmentation problem originally introduced in Goldwater (2006). [sent-4, score-0.293]
</p><p>3 By adding rejuvenation to a particle filter, we are able to considerably improve its performance, both in terms of finding higher probability and higher accuracy solutions. [sent-5, score-1.195]
</p><p>4 1 Introduction The goal of word segmentation is to segment a stream of segments, e. [sent-6, score-0.139]
</p><p>5 The models introduced in Goldwater (2006) solve this problem in a fully unsupervised way by defining a generative process for word sequences, making use of the Dirichlet Process (DP) prior. [sent-10, score-0.02]
</p><p>6 Until recently, the only inference algorithm applied to these models were batch Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithms. [sent-11, score-0.294]
</p><p>7 B ¨orschinger and Johnson (201 1) proposed a strictly incremental particle filter algorithm that, however, performed considerably worse than the standard batch algorithms, in particular for the Bigram model. [sent-12, score-0.992]
</p><p>8 We extend that algorithm by adding rejuvenation steps and show that this leads to considerable improvements, thus strengthening the case for particle filters as another tool for Bayesian inference in computational linguistics. [sent-13, score-1.369]

</p><p>11 This has been shown by Goldwater (2006) to markedly improve segmentation performance. [sent-22, score-0.176]
</p><p>12 We perform experiments on both models but, for reasons of space, only give an overview of the Unigram model, referring the reader to the original papers for more detailed descriptions. [sent-23, score-0.023]
</p><p>13 , 2009) A sequence of words or utterance is generated by  making independent draws from a discrete distribution over words, G. [sent-25, score-0.181]
</p><p>14 As neither the actual “true” words nor their number is known in advance, G is modelled as a draw from a DP. [sent-26, score-0.02]
</p><p>15 A DP is parametrized by a base distribution P0 and a concentration parameter α. [sent-27, score-0.051]
</p><p>16 Here, P0 assigns a probability to every possible word, i. [sent-28, score-0.033]
</p><p>17 To computationally cope with the unbounded nature of draws from a DP, they can be “integrated out”, yielding the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP), an infinitely exchangeable conditional predictive distribution. [sent-31, score-0.086]
</p><p>18 The CRP also provides an intuitive generative story for the observed data. [sent-32, score-0.022]
</p><p>19 Each generated word token corresponds to a customer sitProce Jedijung, sR oefpu thbeli c50 othf K Aonrneua,a8l -M14e Jtiunlgy o 2f0 t1h2e. [sent-33, score-0.095]
</p><p>20 The former happens with probability proportional to the number of customers already sitting at a table and corresponds  to generating one more token of the word type all customers at a table instantiate. [sent-37, score-0.329]
</p><p>21 The latter happens with probability proportional to α and corresponds to generating a token by sampling from the base distribution, thus also determining the type for all potential future customers at the new table. [sent-38, score-0.303]
</p><p>22 Given this generative process, word segmentation can be cast as a probabilistic inference problem. [sent-39, score-0.173]
</p><p>23 For a fixed input, in our case a sequence of phonemes, our goal is to determine the posterior distribution over segmentations. [sent-40, score-0.139]
</p><p>24 This is usually infeasible to do exactly, leading to the use of approximate inference methods. [sent-41, score-0.034]
</p><p>25 3  Previous Work  The “standard” inference algorithms for the Unigram and Bigram model are MCMC samplers that are batch algorithms making multiple iterations over the data to non-deterministically explore the state space of possible segmentations. [sent-42, score-0.239]
</p><p>26 If an MCMC algorithm runs long enough, the probability of it visiting any specific segmentation is the probability of that segmentation under the target posterior distribution,  here, the distribution over segmentations given the observed data. [sent-43, score-0.612]
</p><p>27 (2009) is a Gibbs sampler that makes very small moves through the state space by changing individual word boundaries one at a time. [sent-45, score-0.04]
</p><p>28 An alternative MCMC algorithm that samples segmentations for entire utterances was proposed by Mochihashi et al. [sent-46, score-0.14]
</p><p>29 (2010) describe an algorithm that can be seen as a degenerate limiting case of a particle filter with only one particle. [sent-50, score-0.737]
</p><p>30 Their Dynamic Programming Sampling algorithm makes a single pass through the data, processing one utterance at a time by sampling a segmentation given the choices made for all previous utterances. [sent-51, score-0.334]
</p><p>31 This paper shows how their algorithm can be improved by adding rejuvenation steps, which we will describe in the next section. [sent-53, score-0.673]
</p><p>32 4  A Particle Filter with Rejuvenation  The core idea of a particle filter is to sequentially approximate a target posterior distribution P by N weighted point samples or “particles”. [sent-54, score-0.856]
</p><p>33 Here, each particle corresponds to a specific seg-  mentation of the data observed so far, or more precisely, the specific CRP seating of word tokens in this segmentation; we refer to this as its history. [sent-56, score-0.597]
</p><p>34 Its weight indicates how well a particle is supported by the data, and each observation corresponds to an unsegmented utterance. [sent-57, score-0.636]
</p><p>35 With this, the basic particle filter algorithm can be described as follows: Begin with N “empty” particles. [sent-58, score-0.702]
</p><p>36 To get the particles at time t+ 1from the particles at time t, update each particle using the observation at time t+1as follows: sample a segmentation for this observation, given the particle’s history, then add the words in this segmentation to that history. [sent-59, score-1.312]
</p><p>37 After each particle has been updated, their weights are adjusted to reflect how well they are now supported by the observations. [sent-60, score-0.526]
</p><p>38 The set of updated and reweighted particles constitutes the approximation of the posterior at time t + 1. [sent-61, score-0.33]
</p><p>39 To overcome the problem of degeneracy (the situation where only very few particles have nonnegligible weights), B ¨orschinger and Johnson use resampling; basically, high-probability particles are permitted to have multiple descendants that can replace low-probability particles. [sent-62, score-0.467]
</p><p>40 For reasons of space, we refer the reader to B ¨orschinger and John-  son (201 1) for the details of these steps. [sent-63, score-0.023]
</p><p>41 While necessary to address the degeneracy problem, resampling leads to a loss of sample diversity; very quickly, almost all particles have an identical history, descending from only a small number of (previously) high probability particles. [sent-64, score-0.435]
</p><p>42 With a strict online learning constraint, this can only be counteracted by using an extremely large number of particles. [sent-65, score-0.021]
</p><p>43 After each resampling step, for each particle the algorithm performs a fixed number of the following re-  juvenation steps: 1. [sent-72, score-0.688]
</p><p>44 resample the segmentation for this utterance and update the particle accordingly For the resampling step, we use Mochihashi et al. [sent-74, score-0.904]
</p><p>45 (2009)’s algorithm to efficiently sample segmentations for an unsegmented utterance o, given a sequence of n previously observed words W1:n. [sent-75, score-0.308]
</p><p>46 As the CRP is exchangeable, during resampling we can treat every utterance as if it were the last, making it possible to use this algorithm for any utterance, irrespective of its actual position in the data. [sent-76, score-0.287]
</p><p>47 It is precisely because we ignore these dependencies that an efficient dynamic programming algorithm is possible, but because Q is different  from the target conditional distribution P, our algorithm that uses Q instead of P needs to correct for this. [sent-78, score-0.173]
</p><p>48 In a particle filter, this is done when the particle weights are calculated (B¨ orschinger and Johnson, 2011). [sent-79, score-1.209]
</p><p>49 For an MCMC algorithm or our rejuvenation step, a Metropolis-Hastings accept/reject step is required, as described in detail by Johnson et al. [sent-80, score-0.674]
</p><p>50 The remainder of the paper empirically evaluates the particle filter with rejuvenation. [sent-84, score-0.641]
</p><p>51 5  Experiments  We compare the performance of a batch MetropolisHastings sampler for the Unigram and Bigram model with that of particle filter learners both with and without rejuvenation, as described in the previous section. [sent-85, score-0.874]
</p><p>52 For the batch samplers, we use simulated annealing to facilitate the finding of high probability solutions, and for the particle filters, we compare the performance of a ‘degenerate’ 1-particle learner with a 16-particle learner in the rejuvenation setting. [sent-86, score-1.453]
</p><p>53 To get an impression of the contribution of particle number and rejuvenation steps, we compare 1Because Mochihashi et al. [sent-87, score-1.112]
</p><p>54 (2009)’s algorithm samples directly from the proposal distribution without the accept-reject step, it is not actually sampling from the intended posterior distribution. [sent-88, score-0.325]
</p><p>55 PFx is a particle filter with x particles and no rejuvenation. [sent-92, score-0.851]
</p><p>56 PFx,s is a particle filter with x particles and s rejuvenation steps. [sent-93, score-1.437]
</p><p>57 TF is token f-score, logProb is the log-probability (×103) of the training-data at the end of learning. [sent-94, score-0.066]
</p><p>58 Results for the 1000 particle setting are taken from B ¨orschinger and Johnson (201 1). [sent-97, score-0.526]
</p><p>59 the 16-particle learner with rejuvenation with a 1particle learner that performs 16 times as many rejuvenation samples. [sent-98, score-1.31]
</p><p>60 (2009) in that it doesn’t assume a uniform distribution over segments in the base-distribution but puts a Dirichlet Prior on it. [sent-100, score-0.077]
</p><p>61 We apply each learner to the Bernstein-Ratner corpus (Brent, 1999) that is standardly used in the word segmentation literature, which consists of 9790 unsegmented and phonemically transcribed child-directed speech utterances. [sent-101, score-0.273]
</p><p>62 Note that these two measures can diverge, as previously documented for the Unigram model (Goldwater, 2006) and, less so, for the Bigram model (Pearl et al. [sent-103, score-0.029]
</p><p>63 For both models, adding rejuvenation always improves performance markedly as compared to the corresponding run without rejuvenation both in terms of log-probability and segmentation f-score. [sent-106, score-1.374]
</p><p>64 Note in particular that for the Bigram model, using 16 particles with 100 rejuvenation steps leads to an improvement in token f-score of more than 10% points over 1000 particles without rejuvenation. [sent-107, score-1.155]
</p><p>65 Comparing the 1-particle learner with 1600 rejuvenation steps to the 16-particle learner with 100 rejuvenation steps, for both models the former outperforms the latter in both log-probability and token fscore. [sent-108, score-1.435]
</p><p>66 This suggests that if one has to trade-off particle number against rejuvenation steps, one may be better off favouring the latter. [sent-109, score-1.112]
</p><p>67 Despite the dramatic improvement over not using rejuvenation, there is still a considerable gap between all the incremental learners and the batch sampling algorithm in terms of log-probability. [sent-110, score-0.447]
</p><p>68 A similar observation was made by Johnson and Goldwater (2009) for incremental initialisation in word segmentation using adaptor grammars. [sent-111, score-0.321]
</p><p>69 Their batch  sampler converged on higher token f-score but lower probability solutions in some settings when initialized in an incremental fashion as opposed to randomly. [sent-112, score-0.382]
</p><p>70 We agree with their suggestion that this may be due to the “greedy” character of an incremental learner. [sent-113, score-0.093]
</p><p>71 6 Conclusion and outlook We have shown that adding rejuvenation to a particle filter improves segmentation scores and logprobabilities. [sent-114, score-1.392]
</p><p>72 Yet, our incremental algorithm still finds lower probability but high quality token fscores compared to its batch counterpart. [sent-115, score-0.403]
</p><p>73 Further research into incremental learning algorithms may help us better understand how processing limitations can affect learning and why this may be beneficial for language acquisition, as suggested, for example,  in Newport (1988). [sent-117, score-0.093]

The error correction task is hindered by the difficulty of collecting large error corpora. We tackle this problem by using pseudoerror sentences generated automatically. Furthermore, we apply domain adaptation, the pseudo-error sentences are from the source domain, and the real-error sentences are from the target domain. Experiments show that stable improvement is achieved by using domain adaptation.</p><p>3 0.087328777 <a title="211-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Bootstrapping_a_Unified_Model_of_Lexical_and_Phonetic_Acquisition.html">41 acl-2012-Bootstrapping a Unified Model of Lexical and Phonetic Acquisition</a></p>
<p>Author: Micha Elsner ; Sharon Goldwater ; Jacob Eisenstein</p><p>Abstract: ILCC, School of Informatics School of Interactive Computing University of Edinburgh Georgia Institute of Technology Edinburgh, EH8 9AB, UK Atlanta, GA, 30308, USA (a) intended: /ju want w2n/ /want e kUki/ (b) surface: [j@ w a?P w2n] [wan @ kUki] During early language acquisition, infants must learn both a lexicon and a model of phonetics that explains how lexical items can vary in pronunciation—for instance “the” might be realized as [Di] or [D@]. Previous models of acquisition have generally tackled these problems in isolation, yet behavioral evidence suggests infants acquire lexical and phonetic knowledge simultaneously. We present a Bayesian model that clusters together phonetic variants of the same lexical item while learning both a language model over lexical items and a log-linear model of pronunciation variability based on articulatory features. The model is trained on transcribed surface pronunciations, and learns by bootstrapping, without access to the true lexicon. We test the model using a corpus of child-directed speech with realistic phonetic variation and either gold standard or automatically induced word boundaries. In both cases modeling variability improves the accuracy of the learned lexicon over a system that assumes each lexical item has a unique pronunciation.</p><p>4 0.082294933 <a title="211-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Exploiting_Social_Information_in_Grounded_Language_Learning_via_Grammatical_Reduction.html">88 acl-2012-Exploiting Social Information in Grounded Language Learning via Grammatical Reduction</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark Johnson ; Katherine Demuth ; Michael Frank</p><p>Abstract: This paper uses an unsupervised model of grounded language acquisition to study the role that social cues play in language acquisition. The input to the model consists of (orthographically transcribed) child-directed utterances accompanied by the set of objects present in the non-linguistic context. Each object is annotated by social cues, indicating e.g., whether the caregiver is looking at or touching the object. We show how to model the task of inferring which objects are being talked about (and which words refer to which objects) as standard grammatical inference, and describe PCFG-based unigram models and adaptor grammar-based collocation models for the task. Exploiting social cues improves the performance of all models. Our models learn the relative importance of each social cue jointly with word-object mappings and collocation structure, consis- tent with the idea that children could discover the importance of particular social information sources during word learning.</p><p>5 0.073371224 <a title="211-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-A_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Approach_to_Acoustic_Model_Discovery.html">16 acl-2012-A Nonparametric Bayesian Approach to Acoustic Model Discovery</a></p>
<p>Author: Chia-ying Lee ; James Glass</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of acoustic modeling in which prior language-specific knowledge and transcribed data are unavailable. We present an unsupervised model that simultaneously segments the speech, discovers a proper set of sub-word units (e.g., phones) and learns a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for each induced acoustic unit. Our approach is formulated as a Dirichlet process mixture model in which each mixture is an HMM that represents a sub-word unit. We apply our model to the TIMIT corpus, and the results demonstrate that our model discovers sub-word units that are highly correlated with English phones and also produces better segmentation than the state-of-the-art unsupervised baseline. We test the quality of the learned acoustic models on a spoken term detection task. Compared to the baselines, our model improves the relative precision of top hits by at least 22.1% and outper- forms a language-mismatched acoustic model.</p><p>6 0.071743213 <a title="211-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Fast_Online_Training_with_Frequency-Adaptive_Learning_Rates_for_Chinese_Word_Segmentation_and_New_Word_Detection.html">94 acl-2012-Fast Online Training with Frequency-Adaptive Learning Rates for Chinese Word Segmentation and New Word Detection</a></p>

The error correction task is hindered by the difficulty of collecting large error corpora. We tackle this problem by using pseudoerror sentences generated automatically. Furthermore, we apply domain adaptation, the pseudo-error sentences are from the source domain, and the real-error sentences are from the target domain. Experiments show that stable improvement is achieved by using domain adaptation.</p><p>3 0.50225264 <a title="211-lsi-3" href="./acl-2012-A_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Approach_to_Acoustic_Model_Discovery.html">16 acl-2012-A Nonparametric Bayesian Approach to Acoustic Model Discovery</a></p>
<p>Author: Chia-ying Lee ; James Glass</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of acoustic modeling in which prior language-specific knowledge and transcribed data are unavailable. We present an unsupervised model that simultaneously segments the speech, discovers a proper set of sub-word units (e.g., phones) and learns a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for each induced acoustic unit. Our approach is formulated as a Dirichlet process mixture model in which each mixture is an HMM that represents a sub-word unit. We apply our model to the TIMIT corpus, and the results demonstrate that our model discovers sub-word units that are highly correlated with English phones and also produces better segmentation than the state-of-the-art unsupervised baseline. We test the quality of the learned acoustic models on a spoken term detection task. Compared to the baselines, our model improves the relative precision of top hits by at least 22.1% and outper- forms a language-mismatched acoustic model.</p><p>4 0.48145935 <a title="211-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-A_Joint_Model_for_Discovery_of_Aspects_in_Utterances.html">14 acl-2012-A Joint Model for Discovery of Aspects in Utterances</a></p>

<p>Author: Mark Johnson ; Katherine Demuth ; Michael Frank</p><p>Abstract: This paper uses an unsupervised model of grounded language acquisition to study the role that social cues play in language acquisition. The input to the model consists of (orthographically transcribed) child-directed utterances accompanied by the set of objects present in the non-linguistic context. Each object is annotated by social cues, indicating e.g., whether the caregiver is looking at or touching the object. We show how to model the task of inferring which objects are being talked about (and which words refer to which objects) as standard grammatical inference, and describe PCFG-based unigram models and adaptor grammar-based collocation models for the task. Exploiting social cues improves the performance of all models. Our models learn the relative importance of each social cue jointly with word-object mappings and collocation structure, consis- tent with the idea that children could discover the importance of particular social information sources during word learning.</p><p>5 0.54548198 <a title="211-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-SITS%3A_A_Hierarchical_Nonparametric_Model_using_Speaker_Identity_for_Topic_Segmentation_in_Multiparty_Conversations.html">171 acl-2012-SITS: A Hierarchical Nonparametric Model using Speaker Identity for Topic Segmentation in Multiparty Conversations</a></p>
<p>Author: Viet-An Nguyen ; Jordan Boyd-Graber ; Philip Resnik</p><p>Abstract: One of the key tasks for analyzing conversational data is segmenting it into coherent topic segments. However, most models of topic segmentation ignore the social aspect of conversations, focusing only on the words used. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian nonparametric model, Speaker Identity for Topic Segmentation (SITS), that discovers (1) the topics used in a conversation, (2) how these topics are shared across conversations, (3) when these topics shift, and (4) a person-specific tendency to introduce new topics. We evaluate against current unsupervised segmentation models to show that including personspecific information improves segmentation performance on meeting corpora and on political debates. Moreover, we provide evidence that SITS captures an individual’s tendency to introduce new topics in political contexts, via analysis of the 2008 US presidential debates and the television program Crossfire. 1 Topic Segmentation as a Social Process Conversation, interactive discussion between two or more people, is one of the most essential and common forms of communication. Whether in an informal situation or in more formal settings such as a political debate or business meeting, a conversation is often not about just one thing: topics evolve and are replaced as the conversation unfolds. Discovering this hidden structure in conversations is a key problem for conversational assistants (Tur et al., 2010) and tools that summarize (Murray et al., 2005) and display (Ehlen et al., 2007) conversational data. Topic segmentation also can illuminate individuals’ agendas (Boydstun et al., 2011), patterns of agree- ment and disagreement (Hawes et al., 2009; Abbott 78 Jordan Boyd-Graber iSchool and UMIACS University of Maryland College Park, MD jbg@ umiac s .umd .edu Philip Resnik Department of Linguistics and UMIACS University of Maryland College Park, MD re snik @ umd .edu al., 2011), and relationships among conversational participants (Ireland et al., 2011). One of the most natural ways to capture conversational structure is topic segmentation (Reynar, 1998; Purver, 2011). Topic segmentation approaches range from simple heuristic methods based on lexical similarity (Morris and Hirst, 1991 ; Hearst, 1997) to more intricate generative models and supervised methods (Georgescul et al., 2006; Purver et al., 2006; Gruber et al., 2007; Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008), which have been shown to outperform the established heuristics. However, previous computational work on conversational structure, particularly in topic discovery and topic segmentation, focuses primarily on conet tent, ignoring the speakers. We argue that, because conversation is a social process, we can understand conversational phenomena better by explicitly modeling behaviors of conversational participants. In Section 2, we incorporate participant identity in a new model we call Speaker Identity for Topic Segmentation (SITS), which discovers topical structure in conversation while jointly incorporating a participantlevel social component. Specifically, we explicitly model an individual’s tendency to introduce a topic. After outlining inference in Section 3 and introducing data in Section 4, we use SITS to improve state-ofthe-art-topic segmentation and topic identification models in Section 5. In addition, in Section 6, we also show that the per-speaker model is able to discover individuals who shape and influence the course of a conversation. Finally, we discuss related work and conclude the paper in Section 7. 2 Modeling Multiparty Discussions Data Properties We are interested in turn-taking, multiparty discussion. This is a broad category, inProce Jedijung, sR oefpu thbeli c50 othf K Aonrneua,a8l -M14e Jtiunlgy o 2f0 t1h2e.

More formally, such datasets contain C conversations. A conversation c has Tc turns, each of which is a maximal uninterrupted utterance by one speaker.1 In each turn t ∈ [1, Tc], a speaker ac,t utters N words {wc,t,n}. Eatch ∈ w [1o,rTd is from a vocabulary of size V , {awnd th}ere are M distinct speakers. Modeling Approaches The key insight of topic segmentation is that segments evince lexical cohesion (Galley et al., 2003; Olney and Cai, 2005). Words within a segment will look more like their neighbors than other words. This insight has been used to tune supervised methods (Hsueh et al., 2006) and inspire unsupervised models of lexical cohesion using bags of words (Purver et al., 2006) and language models (Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008). We too take the unsupervised statistical approach. It requires few resources and is applicable in many domains without extensive training. Like previous approaches, we consider each turn to be a bag of words generated from an admixture of topics. Topics—after the topic modeling literature (Blei and Lafferty, 2009)—are multinomial distributions over terms. These topics are part of a generative model posited to have produced a corpus. However, topic models alone cannot model the dynamics of a conversation. Topic models typically do not model the temporal dynamics of individual documents, and those that do (Wang et al., 2008; Gerrish and Blei, 2010) are designed for larger documents and are not applicable here because they assume that most topics appear in every time slice. Instead, we endow each turn with a binary latent variable lc,t, called the topic shift. This latent variable signifies whether the speaker changed the topic of the conversation. To capture the topic-controlling behavior of the speakers across different conversations, we further associate each speaker m with a latent topic shift tendency, πm. Informally, this variable is intended to capture the propensity of a speaker to effect a topic shift. Formally, it represents the probability that the speaker m will change the topic (distribution) of a conversation. We take a Bayesian nonparametric approach (M¨uller and Quintana, 2004). Unlike 1Note the distinction with phonetic definition are bounded by silence. utterances, which by 79 parametric models, which a priori fix the number of topics, nonparametric models use a flexible number of topics to better represent data. Nonparametric distributions such as the Dirichlet process (Ferguson, 1973) share statistical strength among conversations using a hierarchical model, such as the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) (Teh et al., 2006). 2.1 Generative Process In this section, we develop SITS, a generative model of multiparty discourse that jointly discovers topics and speaker-specific topic shifts from an unannotated corpus (Figure 1a). As in the hierarchical Dirichlet process (Teh et al., 2006), we allow an unbounded number of topics to be shared among the turns of the corpus. Topics are drawn from a base distribution H over multinomial distributions over the vocabulary, a finite Dirichlet with symmetric prior λ. Unlike the HDP, where every document (here, every turn) draws a new multinomial distribution from a Dirichlet process, the social and temporal dynamics of a conversation, as specified by the binary topic shift indicator lc,t, determine when new draws happen. The full generative process is as follows: 1. For speaker m ∈ [1, M], draw speaker shift probability πm ∼ Beta(γ) 2. Draw∼ global probability measure G0 ∼ DP(α, H) 3. For each conversation c ∈ [1, C] (a) Draw conversation distribution Gc ∼ DP(α0 , G0) (b) For each turn t ∈ [1, Tc] with speaker ac,t i. If t = 1, set the topic shift lc,t = 1. Otherwise, draw lc,t ∼ Bernoulli(πac,t ). ii. If lc,t = 1∼, d Breawrn Gc,t ∼ DP(αc, Gc). Otherwise, set Gc,t ≡ Gc,t−1 . iii. For each word ≡ind Gex n ∈ [1, Nc,t] • Draw ψc,t,n ∼ Gc,t • DDrraaww wc,t,n ∼ Multinomial(ψc,t,n) The hierarchy of Dirichlet processes allows statistical strength to be shared across contexts; within a conversation and across conversations. The perspeaker topic shift tendency πm allows speaker identity to influence the evolution of topics. To make notation concrete and aligned with the topic segmentation, we introduce notation for segments in a conversation. A segment s of conversation c is a sequence of turns [τ, τ0] such that lc,τ = lc,τ0+1 = 1and lc,t = 0, ∀t ∈ (τ, τ0] . When lc,t = 0, Gc,t is the same =Gc 0,t,−∀1t a ∈nd ( aτ,llτ τtopics (i.e. multinomial distributions over words) {ψc,t,n} that generate words in turn t and the topics{ ψ{ψc,t}−1,n} that generate words in turn t −1 come from{ψ ψthc,et −s1a,mn}e as Figure 1: Graphical model representations of our proposed models: (a) the nonparametric version; (b) the parametric version. Nodes represent random variables (shaded ones are observed), lines are probabilistic dependencies. Plates represent repetition. The innermost plates are turns, grouped in conversations. distribution. Thus all topics used in a segment s are drawn from a single distribution, Gc,s, , , , Gc,s | lc,1 lc,2 · · · lc,Tc , αc, Gc ∼ DP(αc, Gc) (1) For notational convenience, Sc denotes the number of segments in conversation c, and st denotes the segment index of turn t. We emphasize that all segment-related notations are derived from the posterior over the topic shifts land not part of the model itself. Parametric Version SITS is a generalization of a parametric model (Figure 1b) where each turn has a multinomial distribution over K topics. In the parametric case, the number of topics K is fixed. Each topic, as before, is a multinomial distribution φ1 . . . φK. In the parametric case, each turn t in conversation c has an explicit multinomial distribution over K topics θc,t, identical for turns within a segment. A new topic distribution θ is drawn from a Dirichlet distribution parameterized by α when the topic shift indicator lis 1. The parametric version does not share strength within or across conversations, unlike SITS. When applied on a single conversation without speaker identity (all speakers are identical) it is equivalent to (Purver et al., 2006). In our experiments (Section 5), we compare against both. 80 3 Inference To find the latent variables that best explain observed data, we use Gibbs sampling, a widely used Markov chain Monte Carlo inference technique (Neal, 2000; Resnik and Hardisty, 2010). The state space is latent variables for topic indices assigned to all tokens z = {zc,t,n} and topic shifts assigned to turns l= {lc,t}. {Wze marginalize over all other latent variablle =s. Here, we only present the conditional sampling equations; for more details, see our supplement.2 3.1 Sampling Topic Assignments To sample zc,t,n, the index of the shared topic assigned to token n of turn t in conversation c, we need to sample the path assigning each word token to a segment-specific topic, each segment-specific topic to a conversational topic and each conversational topic to a shared topic. For efficiency, we make use of the minimal path assumption (Wallach, 2008) to generate these assignments.3 Under the minimal path assumption, an observation is assumed to have been generated by using a new distribution if and only if there is no existing distribution with the same value. 2 http://www.cs.umd.edu/∼vietan/topicshift/appendix.pdf 3We also investigated using the maximal assumption and fully sampling assignments. We found the minimal path assumption worked as well as explicitly sampling seating assignments and that the maximal path assumption worked less well. We use Nc,s,k to denote the number of tokens in segment s in conversation c assigned topic k; Nc,k denotes the total number of segment-specific topics in conversation c assigned topic k and Nk denotes the number of conversational topics assigned topic k. TWk,w denotes the number of times the shared topic k is assigned to word w in the vocabulary. Marginal counts are represented with · and ∗ represents all hyperparameters. The condit·ional d∗istribution for zc,t,n is P(zc,t,n = k | wc,t,n = w, z−c,t,n, w−c,t,n, l, ∗) ∝ Nc−,sct ,kn+αNc −c,s−ct,kct·,n Nn+c −,·αc ,t0cnN +k−· αc,t0 ,n + αK ×  VT1 W k−, ·c,wctk, n e+w V.λ( 2), Here V is the size of the vocabulary, K is the current number of shared topics and the superscript −c,t,n denotes counts without considering wc,t,n. In Equation 2, the first factor is proportional to the probability of sampling a path according to the minimal path assumption; the second factor is proportional to the likelihood of observing w given the sampled topic. Since an uninformed prior is used, when a new topic is sampled, all tokens are equiprobable. 3.2 Sampling Topic Shifts Sampling the topic shift variable lc,t requires us to consider merging or splitting segments. We use kc,t to denote the shared topic indices of all tokens in turn t of conversation c; Sac,t,x to denote the number of times speaker ac,t is assigned the topic shift with value x ∈ {0, 1}; Jcx,s to denote the number of topics in segment s 1o}f conversation c if lc,t = x and Ncx,s,j to denote the number of tokens assigned to the segment-specific topic j when lc,t = x.4 Again, the superscript −c,t is used to denote exclusion of turn t of conversation c in the corresponding counts. Recall that the topic shift is a binary variable. We use 0 to represent the case that the topic distribution is identical to the previous turn. We sample this assignment P(lc,t = 0 | l−c,t, w, k, a, ∗) ∝ SSa−a−cc,c,ct,t , t·,0++ 2 γγ×αcJ0c,sNtx=Qc01,sjJt=c,0·,1s(tx(N −c0 1,s +t,j α−c) 1)!. (3) 4Deterministically knowQing the path assignments is the primary efficiency motivation for using the minimal path assumption. The alternative is to explicitly sample the path assignments, which is more complicated (for both notation and computation). This option is spelled in full detail in the supplementary material. 81 In Equation 3, the first factor is proportional to the probability of assigning a topic shift of value 0 to speaker ac,t and the second factor is proportional to the joint probability of all topics in segment st of conversation c when lc,t = 0. The other alternative is for the topic shift to be 1, which represents the introduction of a new distri- bution over topics inside an existing segment. We sample this as P(lc,t = 1 | l−c,t, w, k, a, ∗) ∝ S −a −c ,c t, t, t, ·1+ 2 γ ×αcJc1,(st−1x)NQ=c1,1(jJs=ct1−,1(s1t)−,·1()x(N −c1 1,( +st− α1c) ,j− 1)! αcJcQ1,sNxt=c1Q1,stJj,c=1·,(s1xt( −N 1c1, +stj α−c) 1)!. (4) As above, the first faQctor in Equation 4 is proportional to the probability of assigning a topic shift of value 1to speaker ac,t; the second factor in the big bracket is proportional to the joint distribution of the topics in segments st − 1 and st. In this case lc,t = 1 means splitting the current segment, which results in two joint probabilities for two segments. 4 Datasets This section introduces the three corpora we use. We preprocess the data to remove stopwords and remove turns containing fewer than five tokens. The ICSI Meeting Corpus: The ICSI Meeting Corpus (Janin et al., 2003) is 75 transcribed meetings. For evaluation, we used a standard set of reference segmentations (Galley et al., 2003) of 25 meetings. Segmentations are binary, i.e., each point of the document is either a segment boundary or not, and on average each meeting has 8 segment boundaries. After preprocessing, there are 60 unique speakers and the vocabulary contains 3346 non-stopword tokens. The 2008 Presidential Election Debates Our second dataset contains three annotated presidential debates (Boydstun et al., 2011) between Barack Obama and John McCain and a vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin. Each turn is one of two types: questions (Q) from the moderator or responses (R) from a candidate. Each clause in a turn is coded with a Question Topic (TQ) and a Response Topic (TR). Thus, a turn has a list of TQ’s and TR’s both of length equal to the number of clauses in the turn. Topics are from the Policy Agendas Topics SpeakerTypeTurn clausesTQTR BrokawQbSeenfo.r Oeib ta gmeat,s [b.e.t.t]er A arned yo thuey sa oyuingght [. to. b]e th parte tphaere Adm foerri tchaant? economy is going to get much worse1N/A ObamaR[hN.o .m,.]e Is B a,um mtac mokenofs itdu iermenpt o ahrabt oaun th tel yt ,h we c Aaen’rm epea gryoic ithnangei e trco bo hinlaosvm e[.y t. o. h]elp ordinary familes be able to stay in their1 1 4 BrokawQSen.

The topics (TQ and TR) are from the Policy Agendas Topics Codebook which contains the following codes of topic: Macroeconomics Community Development (14), Government Operations (20). (1), Housing & Codebook, a manual inventory of 19 major topics and 225 subtopics.5 Table 1 shows an example annotation. To get reference segmentations, we assign each turn a real value from 0 to 1indicating how much a turn changes the topic. For a question-typed turn, the score is the fraction of clause topics not appearing in the previous turn; for response-typed turns, the score is the fraction of clause topics that do not appear in the corresponding question. This results in a set of non-binary reference segmentations. For evaluation metrics that require binary segmentations, we create a binary segmentation by setting a turn as a segment boundary if the computed score is 1. This threshold is chosen to include only true segment boundaries. CNN’s Crossfire Crossfire was a weekly U.S. television “talking heads” program engineered to incite heated arguments (hence the name). Each episode features two recurring hosts, two guests, and clips from the week’s news. Our Crossfire dataset contains 1134 transcribed episodes aired between 2000 and 2004.6 There are 2567 unique speakers. Unlike the previous two datasets, Crossfire does not have explicit topic segmentations, so we use it to explore speaker-specific characteristics (Section 6). 5 Topic Segmentation Experiments In this section, we examine how well SITS can replicate annotations of when new topics are introduced. 5 http://www.policyagendas.org/page/topic-codebook 6 http://www.cs.umd.edu/∼vietan/topicshift/crossfire.zip 82 We discuss metrics for evaluating an algorithm’s segmentation against a gold annotation, describe our experimental setup, and report those results. Evaluation Metrics To evaluate segmentations, we use Pk (Beeferman et al., 1999) and WindowDiff (WD) (Pevzner and Hearst, 2002). Both metrics measure the probability that two points in a document will be incorrectly separated by a segment boundary. Both techniques consider all spans of length k in the document and count whether the two endpoints of the window are (im)properly segmented against the gold segmentation. However, these metrics have drawbacks. First, they require both hypothesized and reference segmentations to be binary. Many algorithms (e.g., probabilistic approaches) give non-binary segmentations where candidate boundaries have real-valued scores (e.g., probability or confidence). Thus, evaluation requires arbitrary thresholding to binarize soft scores. To be fair, thresholds are set so the number of segments are equal to a predefined value (Purver et al., 2006; Galley et al., 2003). To overcome these limitations, we also use Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) (Rubner et al., 2000), a metric that measures the distance between two distributions. The EMD is the minimal cost to transform one distribution into the other. Each segmentation can be considered a multi-dimensional distribution where each candidate boundary is a dimension. In EMD, a distance function across features allows partial credit for “near miss” segment boundaries. In addition, because EMD operates on distributions, we can compute the distance between non-binary hypothesized segmentations with binary or real-valued reference segmentations. We use the FastEMD implementation (Pele and Werman, 2009). Experimental Methods We applied the following methods to discover topic segmentations in a document: • TextTiling (Hearst, 1997) is one of the earliest generalpurpose topic segmentation algorithms, sliding a fixedwidth window to detect major changes in lexical similarity. • P-NoSpeaker-S: parametric version without speaker identity run on keaerc-hS conversation (Purver et al., 2006) • P-NoSpeaker-M: parametric version without speaker identity run on Mall conversations • P-SITS: the parametric version of SITS with speaker identity run on all conversations • NP-HMM: the HMM-based nonparametric model which a single topic per turn. This model can be considered a Sticky HDP-HMM (Fox et al., 2008) with speaker identity. • NP-SITS: the nonparametric version of SITS with speaker identity run on all conversations. Parameter Settings and Implementations experiment, all parameters same as in (Hearst, 1997). of TextTiling In our are the For statistical models, Gibbs sampling with 10 randomly initialized chains is used. Initial hyperparameter values are sampled from U(0, 1) to favor sparsity; statistics are collected after 500 burn-in iterations with a lag of 25 iterations over a total of 5000 iterations; and slice sampling (Neal, 2003) optimizes hyperparameters. Results and Analysis Table 2 shows the perfor- mance of various models on the topic segmentation problem, using the ICSI corpus and the 2008 debates. Consistent with previous results, probabilistic models outperform TextTiling. In addition, among the probabilistic models, the models that had access to speaker information consistently segment better than those lacking such information, supporting our assertion that there is benefit to modeling conversation as a social process. Furthermore, NP-SITS outperforms NP-HMM in both experiments, suggesting that using a distribution over topics to turns is better than using a single topic. This is consistent with parametric results reported in (Purver et al., 2006). The contribution of speaker identity seems more valuable in the debate setting. Debates are characterized by strong rewards for setting the agenda; dodging a question or moving the debate toward an oppo83 nent’s weakness can be useful strategies (Boydstun et al., 2011). In contrast, meetings (particularly lowstakes ICSI meetings) are characterized by pragmatic rather than strategic topic shifts. Second, agendasetting roles are clearer in formal debates; a modera- tor is tasked with setting the agenda and ensuring the conversation does not wander too much. The nonparametric model does best on the smaller debate dataset. We suspect that an evaluation that directly accessed the topic quality, either via prediction (Teh et al., 2006) or interpretability (Chang et al., 2009) would favor the nonparametric model more. 6 Evaluating Topic Shift Tendency In this section, we focus on the ability of SITS to capture speaker-level attributes. Recall that SITS associates with each speaker a topic shift tendency π that represents the probability of asserting a new topic in the conversation. While topic segmentation is a well studied problem, there are no established quantitative measurements of an individual’s ability to control a conversation. To evaluate whether the tendency is capturing meaningful characteristics of speakers, we compare our inferred tendencies against insights from political science. 2008 Elections To obtain a posterior estimate of π (Figure 3) we create 10 chains with hyperparameters sampled from the uniform distribution U(0, 1) and averaged π over 10 chains (as described in Section 5). In these debates, Ifill is the moderator of the debate between Biden and Palin; Brokaw, Lehrer and Schieffer are the three moderators of three debates between Obama and McCain. Here “Question” denotes questions from audiences in “town hall” debate. The role of this “speaker” can be considered equivalent to the debate moderator. The topic shift tendencies of moderators are much higher than for candidates. In the three debates between Obama and McCain, the moderators— Brokaw, Lehrer and Schieffer—have significantly higher scores than both candidates. This is a useful reality check, since in a debate the moderators are the ones asking questions and literally controlling the topical focus. Interestingly, in the vice-presidential debate, the score of moderator Ifill is only slightly higher than those of Palin and Biden; this is consistent with media commentary characterizing her as a size of the metrics Pk and WindowDiff chosen to replicate previous results. weak moderator.7 Similarly, the “Question” speaker had a relatively high variance, consistent with an amalgamation of many distinct speakers. These topic shift tendencies suggest that all candidates manage to succeed at some points in setting and controlling the debate topics. Our model gives Obama a slightly higher score than McCain, consistent with social science claims (Boydstun et al., 2011) that Obama had the lead in setting the agenda over McCain. Table 4 shows of SITS-detected topic shifts. Crossfire Crossfire, unlike the debates, has many speakers. This allows us to examine more closely what we can learn about speakers’ topic shift tendency. We verified that SITS can segment topics, and assuming that changing the topic is useful for a speaker, how can we characterize who does so effectively? We examine the relationship between topic shift tendency, social roles, and political ideology. To focus on frequent speakers, we filter out speakers with fewer than 30 turns. Most speakers have relatively small π, with the mode around 0.3. There are, however, speakers with very high topic shift tendencies. Table 5 shows the speakers having the highest values according to SITS. We find that there are three general patterns for who influences the course of a conversation in Crossfire. First, there are structural “speakers” the show uses to frame and propose new topics. These are 7 http://harpers.org/archive/2008/10/hbc-90003659 84 2008 Presidential Election Debates (larger means greater tendency) audience questions, news clips (e.g. many of Gore’s and Bush’s turns from 2000), and voice overs. That SITS is able to recover these is reassuring. Second, the stable of regular hosts receives high topic shift tendencies, which is reasonable given their experience with the format and ostensible moderation roles (in practice they also stoke lively discussion). The remaining class is more interesting. The remaining non-hosts with high topic shift tendency are relative moderates on the political spectrum: • John Kasich, one of few Republicans to support the assault weapons ban and now governor of Ohio, a swing state • Christine Todd Whitman, former Republican governor of CNehrwis Jersey, a very iDtmemano,c froartmice srt Ratee • John McCain, who before 2008 was known as a “maverick” for working with Democrats (e.g. Russ Feingold) This suggests that, despite Crossfire’s tendency to create highly partisan debates, those who are able to work across the political spectrum may best be able to influence the topic under discussion in highly polarized contexts. Table 4 shows detected topic shifts from these speakers; two of these examples (McCain and Whitman) show disagreement of Republicans with President Bush. In the other, Kasich is defending a Republican plan (school vouchers) popular with traditional Democratic constituencies. 7 Related and Future Work In the realm of statistical models, a number of techniques incorporate social connections and identity to explain content in social networks (Chang and Blei, atsbDePMmwphIncFiAoasCrtuLleycnNdAg:irIs’SatYphyo,weumckItGrasy’.qoheivfnuIakgrsdt?heo vna,dtbpJ.omslrheyivcaBnwdspeur[.ihodqtef]nuar,slihmetdnyuaopi’s-SbeI[hBn.FCtDvHLcr]ligEemIhysNoa:nFbvWidxeAltEsghnmRboad:eics[yr.,fmtuwleinha][go.,dLYftweur]–’lhsdaitngxerkbIfoat.hqeslkOufinrmbtyoeha,rit[n.geholyasc]rdi,wteoaxylpm’sburneItaopfkvicsqr.,n[BYoOtafebxruli.,mcEksGgatvn]roOebpyitmlnorcd.ea[sfviPYtr]lgoandyu., Previous turnTurn detected as shifting topic examples of those with high topic shift tendency 238947156FPAGNQMreouna.mlvsWea†‡kt.iluBonrcseh‡.7586 41702 4863150FBCKWMealchgrsitCvA lamuhoin†efr.5 2473509 π.

Apart from those groups, speakers with the highest tendency were political moderates. 2009) and scientific corpora (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004). However, these models ignore the temporal evolution of content, treating documents as static. Models that do investigate the evolution of topics over time typically ignore the identify of the speaker. For example: models having sticky topics over ngrams (Johnson, 2010), sticky HDP-HMM (Fox et al., 2008); models that are an amalgam of sequential models and topic models (Griffiths et al., 2005; Wal85 lach, 2006; Gruber et al., 2007; Ahmed and Xing, 2008; Boyd-Graber and Blei, 2008; Du et al., 2010); or explicit models of time or other relevant features as a distinct latent variable (Wang and McCallum, 2006; Eisenstein et al., 2010). In contrast, SITS jointly models topic and individuals’ tendency to control a conversation. Not only does SITS outperform other models using standard computational linguistics baselines, but it also pro- poses intriguing hypotheses for social scientists. Associating each speaker with a scalar that models their tendency to change the topic does improve performance on standard tasks, but it’s inadequate to fully describe an individual. Modeling individuals’ perspective (Paul and Girju, 2010), “side” (Thomas et al., 2006), or personal preferences for topics (Grimmer, 2009) would enrich the model and better illuminate the interaction of influence and topic. Statistical analysis of political discourse can help discover patterns that political scientists, who often work via a “close reading,” might otherwise miss. We plan to work with social scientists to validate our implicit hypothesis that our topic shift tendency correlates well with intuitive measures of “influence.” Acknowledgements This research was funded in part by the Army Research Laboratory through ARL Cooperative Agreement W91 1NF-09-2-0072 and by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), through the Army Research Laboratory.

In order to adapt to this phenomenon, several semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms, which learn from labeled as well as unlabeled data, have been developed.

Graph-based SSL algorithms, which bring together these two lines of work, have been shown to outperform the state-ofthe-art in many applications in speech processing, computer vision and NLP. In particular, recent NLP research has successfully used graph-based SSL algorithms for PoS tagging (Subramanya et al., 2010), semantic parsing (Das and Smith, 2011), knowledge acquisition (Talukdar et al., 2008), sentiment analysis (Goldberg and Zhu, 2006) and text categoriza- tion (Subramanya and Bilmes, 2008). Recognizing this promising and emerging area of research, this tutorial focuses on graph-based SSL algorithms (e.g., label propagation methods). The tutorial is intended to be a sequel to the ACL 2008 SSL tutorial, focusing exclusively on graph-based SSL methods and recent advances in this area, which were beyond the scope of the previous tutorial. The tutorial is divided in two parts. In the first part, we will motivate the need for graph-based SSL methods, introduce some standard graph-based SSL algorithms, and discuss connections between these approaches. We will also discuss how linguistic data can be encoded as graphs and show how graph-based algorithms can be scaled to large amounts of data (e.g., web-scale data).

<p>Author: Eric Xing</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic topic models have recently gained much popularity in informational retrieval and related areas. Via such models, one can project high-dimensional objects such as text documents into a low dimensional space where their latent semantics are captured and modeled; can integrate multiple sources of information—to ”share statistical strength” among components of a hierarchical probabilistic model; and can structurally display and classify the otherwise unstructured object collections. However, to many practitioners, how topic models work, what to and not to expect from a topic model, how is it different from and related to classical matrix algebraic techniques such as LSI, NMF in NLP, how to empower topic models to deal with complex scenarios such as multimodal data, contractual text in social media, evolving corpus, or presence of supervision such as labeling and rating, how to make topic modeling computationally tractable even on webscale data, etc., in a principled way, remain unclear. In this tutorial, I will demystify the conceptual, mathematical, and computational issues behind all such problems surrounding the topic models and their applications by presenting a systematic overview of the mathematical foundation of topic modeling, and its connections to a number of related methods popular in other fields such as the LDA, admixture model, mixed membership model, latent space models, and sparse coding. Iwill offer a simple and unifying view of all these techniques under the framework multi-view latent space embedding, and online the roadmap of model extension and algorithmic design to3 ward different applications in IR and NLP. A main theme of this tutorial that tie together a wide range of issues and problems will build on the ”probabilistic graphical model” formalism, a formalism that exploits the conjoined talents of graph theory and probability theory to build complex models out of simpler pieces. Iwill use this formalism as a main aid to discuss both the mathematical underpinnings for the models and the related computational issues in a unified, simplistic, transparent, and actionable fashion.

<p>Author: Rada Mihalcea ; Carmen Banea ; Janyce Wiebe</p><p>Abstract: Subjectivity and sentiment analysis focuses on the automatic identification of private states, such as opinions, emotions, sentiments, evaluations, beliefs, and speculations in natural language. While subjectivity classification labels text as either subjective or objective, sentiment classification adds an additional level of granularity, by further classifying subjective text as either positive, negative or neutral. While much of the research work in this area has been applied to English, research on other languages is growing, including Japanese, Chinese, German, Spanish, Romanian. While most of the researchers in the field are familiar with the methods applied on English, few of them have closely looked at the original research carried out in other languages. For example, in languages such as Chinese, researchers have been looking at the ability of characters to carry sentiment information (Ku et al., 2005; Xiang, 2011). In Romanian, due to markers of politeness and additional verbal modes embedded in the language, experiments have hinted that subjectivity detection may be easier to achieve (Banea et al., 2008). These additional sources ofinformation may not be available across all languages, yet, various articles have pointed out that by investigating a synergistic approach for detecting subjectivity and sentiment in multiple languages at the same time, improvements can be achieved not only in other languages, but in English as well. The development and interest in these methods is also highly motivated by the fact that only 27% of Internet users speak English (www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm, 4 . unt . edu wiebe @ c s . pitt . edu Oct 11, 2011), and that number diminishes further every year, as more people across the globe gain Internet access. The aim of this tutorial is to familiarize the attendees with the subjectivity and sentiment research carried out on languages other than English in order to enable and promote crossfertilization. Specifically, we will review work along three main directions. First, we will present methods where the resources and tools have been specifically developed for a given target language. In this category, we will also briefly overview the main methods that have been proposed for English, but which can be easily ported to other languages. Second, we will describe cross-lingual approaches, including several methods that have been proposed to leverage on the resources and tools available in English by using cross-lingual projections. Finally, third, we will show how the expression of opinions and polarity pervades language boundaries, and thus methods that holistically explore multiple languages at the same time can be effectively considered.

<p>Author: Max Whitney ; Anoop Sarkar</p><p>Abstract: Bootstrapping a classifier from a small set of seed rules can be viewed as the propagation of labels between examples via features shared between them. This paper introduces a novel variant of the Yarowsky algorithm based on this view. It is a bootstrapping learning method which uses a graph propagation algorithm with a well defined objective function. The experimental results show that our proposed bootstrapping algorithm achieves state of the art performance or better on several different natural language data sets.</p><p>6 0.081544153 <a title="104-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-State-of-the-Art_Kernels_for_Natural_Language_Processing.html">183 acl-2012-State-of-the-Art Kernels for Natural Language Processing</a></p>

However, to many practitioners, how topic models work, what to and not to expect from a topic model, how is it different from and related to classical matrix algebraic techniques such as LSI, NMF in NLP, how to empower topic models to deal with complex scenarios such as multimodal data, contractual text in social media, evolving corpus, or presence of supervision such as labeling and rating, how to make topic modeling computationally tractable even on webscale data, etc., in a principled way, remain unclear. In this tutorial, I will demystify the conceptual, mathematical, and computational issues behind all such problems surrounding the topic models and their applications by presenting a systematic overview of the mathematical foundation of topic modeling, and its connections to a number of related methods popular in other fields such as the LDA, admixture model, mixed membership model, latent space models, and sparse coding. Iwill offer a simple and unifying view of all these techniques under the framework multi-view latent space embedding, and online the roadmap of model extension and algorithmic design to3 ward different applications in IR and NLP. A main theme of this tutorial that tie together a wide range of issues and problems will build on the ”probabilistic graphical model” formalism, a formalism that exploits the conjoined talents of graph theory and probability theory to build complex models out of simpler pieces. Iwill use this formalism as a main aid to discuss both the mathematical underpinnings for the models and the related computational issues in a unified, simplistic, transparent, and actionable fashion.

<p>Author: Rada Mihalcea ; Carmen Banea ; Janyce Wiebe</p><p>Abstract: Subjectivity and sentiment analysis focuses on the automatic identification of private states, such as opinions, emotions, sentiments, evaluations, beliefs, and speculations in natural language. While subjectivity classification labels text as either subjective or objective, sentiment classification adds an additional level of granularity, by further classifying subjective text as either positive, negative or neutral. While much of the research work in this area has been applied to English, research on other languages is growing, including Japanese, Chinese, German, Spanish, Romanian. While most of the researchers in the field are familiar with the methods applied on English, few of them have closely looked at the original research carried out in other languages. For example, in languages such as Chinese, researchers have been looking at the ability of characters to carry sentiment information (Ku et al., 2005; Xiang, 2011). In Romanian, due to markers of politeness and additional verbal modes embedded in the language, experiments have hinted that subjectivity detection may be easier to achieve (Banea et al., 2008). These additional sources ofinformation may not be available across all languages, yet, various articles have pointed out that by investigating a synergistic approach for detecting subjectivity and sentiment in multiple languages at the same time, improvements can be achieved not only in other languages, but in English as well. The development and interest in these methods is also highly motivated by the fact that only 27% of Internet users speak English (www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm, 4 . unt . edu wiebe @ c s . pitt . edu Oct 11, 2011), and that number diminishes further every year, as more people across the globe gain Internet access. The aim of this tutorial is to familiarize the attendees with the subjectivity and sentiment research carried out on languages other than English in order to enable and promote crossfertilization. Specifically, we will review work along three main directions. First, we will present methods where the resources and tools have been specifically developed for a given target language. In this category, we will also briefly overview the main methods that have been proposed for English, but which can be easily ported to other languages. Second, we will describe cross-lingual approaches, including several methods that have been proposed to leverage on the resources and tools available in English by using cross-lingual projections. Finally, third, we will show how the expression of opinions and polarity pervades language boundaries, and thus methods that holistically explore multiple languages at the same time can be effectively considered.

<p>Author: Amar Subramanya ; Partha Pratim Talukdar</p><p>Abstract: While labeled data is expensive to prepare, ever increasing amounts of unlabeled linguistic data are becoming widely available. In order to adapt to this phenomenon, several semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms, which learn from labeled as well as unlabeled data, have been developed. In a separate line of work, researchers have started to realize that graphs provide a natural way to represent data in a variety of domains. Graph-based SSL algorithms, which bring together these two lines of work, have been shown to outperform the state-ofthe-art in many applications in speech processing, computer vision and NLP. In particular, recent NLP research has successfully used graph-based SSL algorithms for PoS tagging (Subramanya et al., 2010), semantic parsing (Das and Smith, 2011), knowledge acquisition (Talukdar et al., 2008), sentiment analysis (Goldberg and Zhu, 2006) and text categoriza- tion (Subramanya and Bilmes, 2008). Recognizing this promising and emerging area of research, this tutorial focuses on graph-based SSL algorithms (e.g., label propagation methods). The tutorial is intended to be a sequel to the ACL 2008 SSL tutorial, focusing exclusively on graph-based SSL methods and recent advances in this area, which were beyond the scope of the previous tutorial. The tutorial is divided in two parts. In the first part, we will motivate the need for graph-based SSL methods, introduce some standard graph-based SSL algorithms, and discuss connections between these approaches. We will also discuss how linguistic data can be encoded as graphs and show how graph-based algorithms can be scaled to large amounts of data (e.g., web-scale data). Part 2 of the tutorial will focus on how graph-based methods can be used to solve several critical NLP tasks, including basic problems such as PoS tagging, semantic parsing, and more downstream tasks such as text categorization, information acquisition, and 6 Partha Pratim Talukdar Carnegie Mellon University ppt @ cs . cmu . edu sentiment analysis. We will conclude the tutorial with some exciting avenues for future work. Familiarity with semi-supervised learning and graph-based methods will not be assumed, and the necessary background will be provided. Examples from NLP tasks will be used throughout the tutorial to convey the necessary concepts. At the end of this tutorial, the attendee will walk away with the following: • An in-depth knowledge of the current state-oftAhen- ainrt-d dienp graph-based SeS oLf algorithms, taantde- tohfeability to implement them. • The ability to decide on the suitability of graph-based S toSL d meceitdheod osn nfo trh a problem. • Familiarity with different NLP tasks where graph-based wSSitLh m dieftfehorednst h NaLveP Pb teaesnk successfully applied. In addition to the above goals, we hope that this tutorial will better prepare the attendee to conduct exciting research at the intersection of NLP and other emerging areas with natural graph-structured data (e.g., Computation Social Science).

<p>Author: Yang Feng ; Dongdong Zhang ; Mu Li ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: We present a hierarchical chunk-to-string translation model, which can be seen as a compromise between the hierarchical phrasebased model and the tree-to-string model, to combine the merits of the two models. With the help of shallow parsing, our model learns rules consisting of words and chunks and meanwhile introduce syntax cohesion. Under the weighed synchronous context-free grammar defined by these rules, our model searches for the best translation derivation and yields target translation simultaneously. Our experiments show that our model significantly outperforms the hierarchical phrasebased model and the tree-to-string model on English-Chinese Translation tasks.</p><p>3 0.41334641 <a title="104-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-UWN%3A_A_Large_Multilingual_Lexical_Knowledge_Base.html">206 acl-2012-UWN: A Large Multilingual Lexical Knowledge Base</a></p>

<p>Author: Hao Wang ; Dogan Can ; Abe Kazemzadeh ; Francois Bar ; Shrikanth Narayanan</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a system for real-time analysis of public sentiment toward presidential candidates in the 2012 U.S. election as expressed on Twitter, a microblogging service. Twitter has become a central site where people express their opinions and views on political parties and candidates. Emerging events or news are often followed almost instantly by a burst in Twitter volume, providing a unique opportunity to gauge the relation between expressed public sentiment and electoral events. In addition, sentiment analysis can help explore how these events affect public opinion. While traditional content analysis takes days or weeks to complete, the system demonstrated here analyzes sentiment in the entire Twitter traffic about the election, delivering results instantly and continuously. It offers the public, the media, politicians and scholars a new and timely perspective on the dynamics of the electoral process and public opinion. 1</p><p>5 0.40862241 <a title="104-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-A_Comprehensive_Gold_Standard_for_the_Enron_Organizational_Hierarchy.html">6 acl-2012-A Comprehensive Gold Standard for the Enron Organizational Hierarchy</a></p>

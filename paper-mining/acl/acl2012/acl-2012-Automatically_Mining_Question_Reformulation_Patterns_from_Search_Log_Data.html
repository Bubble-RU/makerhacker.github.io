<p>Author: Patrick Pantel ; Thomas Lin ; Michael Gamon</p><p>Abstract: We predict entity type distributions in Web search queries via probabilistic inference in graphical models that capture how entitybearing queries are generated. We jointly model the interplay between latent user intents that govern queries and unobserved entity types, leveraging observed signals from query formulations and document clicks.

<p>Author: Kuzman Ganchev ; Keith Hall ; Ryan McDonald ; Slav Petrov</p><p>Abstract: Syntactic analysis of search queries is important for a variety of information-retrieval tasks; however, the lack of annotated data makes training query analysis models difficult. We propose a simple, efficient procedure in which part-of-speech tags are transferred from retrieval-result snippets to queries at training time. Unlike previous work, our final model does not require any additional resources at run-time. Compared to a state-ofthe-art approach, we achieve more than 20% relative error reduction. Additionally, we annotate a corpus of search queries with partof-speech tags, providing a resource for future work on syntactic query analysis.</p><p>4 0.12022626 <a title="35-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Joint_Learning_of_a_Dual_SMT_System_for_Paraphrase_Generation.html">125 acl-2012-Joint Learning of a Dual SMT System for Paraphrase Generation</a></p>
<p>Author: Hong Sun ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: SMT has been used in paraphrase generation by translating a source sentence into another (pivot) language and then back into the source. The resulting sentences can be used as candidate paraphrases ofthe source sentence. Existing work that uses two independently trained SMT systems cannot directly optimize the paraphrase results. Paraphrase criteria especially the paraphrase rate is not able to be ensured in that way. In this paper, we propose a joint learning method of two SMT systems to optimize the process of paraphrase generation. In addition, a revised BLEU score (called iBLEU) which measures the adequacy and diversity of the generated paraphrase sentence is proposed for tuning parameters in SMT systems. Our experiments on NIST 2008 testing data with automatic evaluation as well as human judgments suggest that the proposed method is able to enhance the paraphrase quality by adjusting between semantic equivalency and surface dissimilarity.</p><p>5 0.12009756 <a title="35-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Community_Answer_Summarization_for_Multi-Sentence_Question_with_Group_L1_Regularization.html">55 acl-2012-Community Answer Summarization for Multi-Sentence Question with Group L1 Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Wen Chan ; Xiangdong Zhou ; Wei Wang ; Tat-Seng Chua</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel answer summarization method for community Question Answering services (cQAs) to address the problem of “incomplete answer”, i.e., the “best answer” of a complex multi-sentence question misses valuable information that is contained in other answers. In order to automatically generate a novel and non-redundant community answer summary, we segment the complex original multi-sentence question into several sub questions and then propose a general Conditional Random Field (CRF) based answer summary method with group L1 regularization. Various textual and non-textual QA features are explored. Specifically, we explore four different types of contextual factors, namely, the information novelty and non-redundancy modeling for local and non-local sentence interactions under question segmentation. To further unleash the potential of the abundant cQA features, we introduce the group L1 regularization for feature learning. Experimental results on a Yahoo!

<p>Author: Zhenghua Li ; Ting Liu ; Wanxiang Che</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple and effective framework for exploiting multiple monolingual treebanks with different annotation guidelines for parsing. Several types of transformation patterns (TP) are designed to capture the systematic annotation inconsistencies among different treebanks. Based on such TPs, we design quasisynchronous grammar features to augment the baseline parsing models. Our approach can significantly advance the state-of-the-art parsing accuracy on two widely used target treebanks (Penn Chinese Treebank 5. 1 and 6.0) using the Chinese Dependency Treebank as the source treebank. The improvements are respectively 1.37% and 1.10% with automatic part-of-speech tags. Moreover, an indirect comparison indicates that our approach also outperforms previous work based on treebank conversion.</p><p>4 0.51481426 <a title="35-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Attacking_Parsing_Bottlenecks_with_Unlabeled_Data_and_Relevant_Factorizations.html">30 acl-2012-Attacking Parsing Bottlenecks with Unlabeled Data and Relevant Factorizations</a></p>
<p>Author: Emily Pitler</p><p>Abstract: Prepositions and conjunctions are two of the largest remaining bottlenecks in parsing. Across various existing parsers, these two categories have the lowest accuracies, and mistakes made have consequences for downstream applications. Prepositions and conjunctions are often assumed to depend on lexical dependencies for correct resolution. As lexical statistics based on the training set only are sparse, unlabeled data can help ameliorate this sparsity problem. By including unlabeled data features into a factorization of the problem which matches the representation of prepositions and conjunctions, we achieve a new state-of-the-art for English dependencies with 93.55% correct attachments on the current standard. Furthermore, conjunctions are attached with an accuracy of 90.8%, and prepositions with an accuracy of 87.4%.</p><p>5 0.5137248 <a title="35-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Aspect_Extraction_through_Semi-Supervised_Modeling.html">28 acl-2012-Aspect Extraction through Semi-Supervised Modeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Arjun Mukherjee ; Bing Liu</p><p>Abstract: Aspect extraction is a central problem in sentiment analysis. Current methods either extract aspects without categorizing them, or extract and categorize them using unsupervised topic modeling. By categorizing, we mean the synonymous aspects should be clustered into the same category. In this paper, we solve the problem in a different setting where the user provides some seed words for a few aspect categories and the model extracts and clusters aspect terms into categories simultaneously. This setting is important because categorizing aspects is a subjective task. For different application purposes, different categorizations may be needed. Some form of user guidance is desired. In this paper, we propose two statistical models to solve this seeded problem, which aim to discover exactly what the user wants. Our experimental results show that the two proposed models are indeed able to perform the task effectively. 1</p><p>6 0.51334935 <a title="35-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-A_Ranking-based_Approach_to_Word_Reordering_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">19 acl-2012-A Ranking-based Approach to Word Reordering for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

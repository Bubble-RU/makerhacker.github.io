</p><p>3 This can be seen as an application-oriented variant of textual entailment recognition where: i) T and H are in different languages, and ii) entailment relations between T and H have to be checked in both directions. [sent-3, score-0.905]
</p><p>4 Using a combination of lexical, syntactic, and semantic features to train a cross-lingual textual entailment system, we report promising results on different datasets. [sent-4, score-0.569]
</p><p>5 1 Introduction Given two documents about the same topic written in different languages (e. [sent-5, score-0.028]
</p><p>6 Wiki pages), content synchronization deals with the problem of au-  tomatically detecting and resolving differences in the information they provide, in order to produce aligned, mutually enriched versions. [sent-7, score-0.364]
</p><p>7 A roadmap towards the solution of this problem has to take into account, among the many sub-tasks, the identification of information in one page that is semantically equivalent, novel, or more informative with respect to the content of the other page. [sent-8, score-0.195]
</p><p>8 In this paper we set such problem as an application-oriented, crosslingual variant of the Textual Entailment (TE) recognition task (Dagan and Glickman, 2004). [sent-9, score-0.043]
</p><p>9 Along this direction, we make two main contributions: (a) Experiments with multi-directional crosslingual textual entailment. [sent-10, score-0.138]
</p><p>10 Instead, we experiment with the only corpus representative of the  multilingual content synchronization scenario, and the richer inventory of phenomena arising from it (multi-directional entailment relations). [sent-13, score-0.737]
</p><p>11 , 2010), or an “integrated solution” that exploits bilingual phrase tables to capture lexical relations and contextual information (Mehdad et al. [sent-16, score-0.309]
</p><p>12 The promising results achieved with the integrated approach, however, still rely on phrasal matching techniques that disregard relevant semantic aspects of the problem. [sent-18, score-0.22]
</p><p>13 By filling this gap integrating linguistically motivated features, we propose a novel approach that improves the state-of-the-art in CLTE. [sent-19, score-0.023]
</p><p>14 2  CLTE-based content synchronization  CLTE has been proposed by (Mehdad et al. [sent-20, score-0.331]
</p><p>15 , 2010) as an extension of textual entailment which consists of deciding, given a text T and an hypothesis H in different languages, if the meaning of H can be inferred from the meaning of T. [sent-21, score-0.579]
</p><p>16 The adoption of entailmentbased techniques to address content synchronization  looks promising, as several issues inherent to such task can be formalized as entailment-related probProce dJienjgus, R ofep thueb 5lic0t hof A Knonruea ,l M 8-e1e4ti Jnugly o f2 t0h1e2 A. [sent-22, score-0.399]
</p><p>17 Given two pages (P1 and P2), these issues include identifying, and properly managing: (1) Text portions in P1 and P2 that express the same meaning (bi-directional entailment). [sent-25, score-0.185]
</p><p>18 In such cases no information has to migrate across P1 and P2, and the two text portions will remain the same; (2) Text portions in P1 that are more informative than portions in P2 (forward entailment). [sent-26, score-0.428]
</p><p>19 In such cases, the novel information from both sides has to be translated and migrated in order to mutually enrich the two pages;  (5) Meaning discrepancies between text portions in the two pages (“contradictions” in RTE parlance). [sent-28, score-0.295]
</p><p>20 CLTE has been previously modeled as a phrase matching problem that exploits dictionaries and phrase tables extracted from bilingual parallel corpora to determine the number of word sequences in H that can be mapped to word sequences in T. [sent-29, score-0.483]
</p><p>21 In this way a semantic judgement about entailment is made exclusively on the basis of lexical evidence. [sent-30, score-0.494]
</p><p>22 When only unidirectional entailment relations from T to H have to be determined (RTE-like setting), the full mapping of the hypothesis into the text usually provides enough evidence for a positive entailment judgement. [sent-31, score-0.88]
</p><p>23 Unfortunately, when dealing with multidirectional entailment, the correlation between the proportion of matching terms and the correct entailment decisions is less strong. [sent-32, score-0.54]
</p><p>24 In such framework, for instance, the full mapping of the hypothesis into the text is per se not sufficient to discriminate between forward entailment and semantic equivalence. [sent-33, score-0.517]
</p><p>25 To cope with these issues, we explore the contribution of syntactic and semantic features as a complement to lexical ones in a supervised learning framework. [sent-34, score-0.197]
</p><p>26 3  Beyond lexical CLTE  In order to enrich the feature space beyond pure lexical match through phrase table entries, our model 121 builds on two additional feature sets, derived from i) semantic phrase tables, and ii) dependency relations. [sent-35, score-0.435]
</p><p>27 Semantic Phrase Table (SPT) matching represents a novel way to leverage the integration of semantics and MT-derived techniques. [sent-36, score-0.15]
</p><p>28 SPT matching extends CLTE methods based on pure lexical match by means of “generalized” phrase tables annotated with shallow semantic labels. [sent-37, score-0.431]
</p><p>29 wordn [LABEL]”, are used as a recall-oriented complement to the phrase tables used in MT. [sent-41, score-0.208]
</p><p>30 A motivation for this augmentation is that semantic tags allow to match tokens that do not occur in the original bilingual parallel corpora used for phrase table extraction. [sent-42, score-0.302]
</p><p>31 Our hypothesis is that the increase in recall obtained from relaxed matches through semantic tags in place of “out of vocabulary” terms (e. [sent-43, score-0.119]
</p><p>32 Like lexical phrase tables, SPTs are extracted from parallel corpora. [sent-46, score-0.174]
</p><p>33 As a first step we annotate the parallel corpora with named-entity taggers for the source and target languages, replacing named entities with general semantic labels chosen from a coarse-grained taxonomy (person, location, organization, date and numeric expression). [sent-47, score-0.156]
</p><p>34 Then, we combine the sequences of unique labels into one single token of the same label, and we run Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2000) to align the resulting semantically augmented corpora. [sent-48, score-0.091]
</p><p>35 Finally, we extract the semantic phrase table from the augmented aligned corpora using the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al. [sent-49, score-0.196]
</p><p>36 For the matching phase, we first annotate T and H in the same way we labeled our parallel corpora. [sent-51, score-0.159]
</p><p>37 Then, for each n-gram order (n=1 to 5) we use the SPT to calculate a matching score as the number of n-grams in H that match with phrases in T divided by the number of n-grams in H. [sent-52, score-0.168]
</p><p>38 1 Dependency Relation (DR) matching targets the increase of CLTE precision. [sent-53, score-0.105]
</p><p>39 Adding syntactic constraints to the matching process, DR features aim to reduce the amount of wrong matches often occur-  ring with bag-of-words methods (both at the lexical level and with recall-oriented SPTs). [sent-54, score-0.204]
</p><p>40 For instance, the contradiction between “Yahoo acquired 1When checking for entailment from H to T, the normalization is carried out dividing by the number of n-grams in T. [sent-55, score-0.463]
</p><p>41 Overture” and “Overture compr ´o Yahoo”, which is evident when syntax is taken into account, can not be caught by shallow methods. [sent-56, score-0.065]
</p><p>42 We define a dependency relation as a triple that connects pairs of words through a grammatical relation. [sent-57, score-0.082]
</p><p>43 DR matching captures similarities between dependency relations, combining the syntactic and lexical level. [sent-58, score-0.209]
</p><p>44 In a valid match, while the relation has to be the same, the connected words can be either the same, or semantically equivalent terms in the two languages (e. [sent-59, score-0.132]
</p><p>45 Given the dependency tree representations of T and H, for each grammatical relation (r) we calculate a DR matching score as the number of matching occurrences of r in T and H, divided by the number of occurrences of r in H. [sent-62, score-0.316]
</p><p>46 Separate DR matching scores are calculated for each relation r appearing both in T and H. [sent-63, score-0.159]
</p><p>47 1 Content synchronization scenario In our first experiment we used the English-German portion of the CLTE corpus described in (Negri et al. [sent-65, score-0.307]
</p><p>48 , 2011), consisting of 500 multi-directional entailment pairs which we equally divided into training and test sets. [sent-66, score-0.406]
</p><p>49 Each pair in the dataset is annotated with “Bidirectional”, “Forward”, or “Backward” entailment judgements. [sent-67, score-0.409]
</p><p>50 Although highly relevant for the content synchronization task, “Contradiction” and “Unknown” cases (i. [sent-68, score-0.331]
</p><p>51 “NO” entailment in both directions) are not present in the annotation. [sent-70, score-0.382]
</p><p>52 However, this is the only available dataset suitable to gather insights about the viability of our approach to multi-directional CLTE recognition. [sent-71, score-0.027]
</p><p>53 2 We chose the ENG-GER portion of the dataset since for such language pair MT systems performance is often lower, making the adoption of simpler solutions based on pivoting more vulnerable. [sent-72, score-0.185]
</p><p>54 To build the English-German phrase tables we combined the Europarl, News Commentary and “denews”3 parallel corpora. [sent-73, score-0.199]
</p><p>55 After tokenization, Giza++ and Moses were respectively used to align the corpora and extract a lexical phrase table (PT). [sent-74, score-0.181]
</p><p>56 Similarly, the semantic phrase table (SPT) has been ex-  2Recently, a new dataset including “Unknown” pairs has been used in the “Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment for Content Synchronization” task at SemEval-2012 (Negri et al. [sent-75, score-0.161]

</p><p>58 Dependency relations (DR) have been extracted running the Stanford parser (Rafferty and Manning, 2008; De Marneffe et al. [sent-83, score-0.046]
</p><p>59 The dictionary created during the alignment of the parallel corpora provided the lexical knowledge to perform matches when the connected words are different, but semantically equivalent in the two languages. [sent-85, score-0.249]
</p><p>60 Two-way classification casts multi-directional entailment as a unidirectional problem, where each pair is analyzed checking for entailment both from left to right and from right to left. [sent-88, score-0.87]
</p><p>61 In this condi-  tion, each original test example is correctly classified if both pairs originated from it are correctly judged (“YES-YES” for bidirectional, “YES-NO” for forward, and “NO-YES” for backward entailment). [sent-89, score-0.043]
</p><p>62 Two-way classification represents an intuitive solution to capture multidirectional entailment relations but, at the same time, a suboptimal approach in terms of efficiency since two checks are performed for each pair. [sent-90, score-0.481]
</p><p>63 Three-way classification is more efficient, but at the same time more challenging due to the higher difficulty of multiclass learning, especially with small datasets. [sent-91, score-0.027]
</p><p>64 Results are compared with two pivoting approaches, checking for entailment between the original English texts and the translated German hypotheses. [sent-92, score-0.573]
</p><p>65 The second (Pivot-PPT) exploits paraphrase tables for phrase matching, and represents the best monolingual model presented in (Mehdad et al. [sent-95, score-0.216]

</p><p>69 (b) In both settings the combination of lexical, syntactic and semantic features (PT+SPT+DR) significantly improves5 the state-of-the-art CLTE model (PT). [sent-120, score-0.085]
</p><p>70 Such improvement is motivated by the joint contribution of SPTs (matching more and longer ngrams, with a consequent recall improvement), and DR matching (adding constraints, with a consequent gain in precision). [sent-121, score-0.197]
</p><p>71 This might be due to the fact that both PT and DR features are precision-oriented, and their effectiveness becomes evident only in combination with recall-oriented features (SPT). [sent-123, score-0.064]
</p><p>72 This suggests that the noise introduced by incorrect translations makes the pivoting approach less attractive in comparison with the more robust cross-lingual models. [sent-125, score-0.116]

</p><p>76 The semantic phrase table (SPT) was extracted from the same corpora annotated with FreeLing (Carreras et al. [sent-131, score-0.173]

However, evaluating such resources has turned out to be a non-trivial task, slowing progress in the field. In this paper, we suggest a framework for evaluating inference-rule resources. Our framework simplifies a previously proposed “instance-based evaluation” method that involved substantial annotator training, making it suitable for crowdsourcing. We show that our method produces a large amount of annotations with high inter-annotator agreement for a low cost at a short period of time, without requiring training expert annotators.</p><p>3 0.16651335 <a title="72-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Entailment-based_Text_Exploration_with_Application_to_the_Health-care_Domain.html">82 acl-2012-Entailment-based Text Exploration with Application to the Health-care Domain</a></p>

The proposed scheme utilizes the textual entailment relation between statements as the basis of the exploration process. A user of our system can explore the result space of a query by drilling down/up from one statement to another, according to entailment relations specified by an entailment graph and an optional concept taxonomy. As a prominent use case, we apply our exploration system and illustrate its benefit on the health-care domain.

<p>Author: Asher Stern ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces BIUTEE1 , an opensource system for recognizing textual entailment. Its main advantages are its ability to utilize various types of knowledge resources, and its extensibility by which new knowledge resources and inference components can be easily integrated. These abilities make BIUTEE an appealing RTE system for two research communities: (1) researchers of end applications, that can benefit from generic textual inference, and (2) RTE researchers, who can integrate their novel algorithms and knowledge resources into our system, saving the time and effort of developing a complete RTE system from scratch. Notable assistance for these re- searchers is provided by a visual tracing tool, by which researchers can refine and “debug” their knowledge resources and inference components.</p><p>5 0.15490645 <a title="72-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Efficient_Tree-based_Approximation_for_Entailment_Graph_Learning.html">80 acl-2012-Efficient Tree-based Approximation for Entailment Graph Learning</a></p>

In this paper we address the problem of learning transitive graphs that describe entailment rules between predicates (termed entailment graphs). We first identify that entailment graphs exhibit a “tree-like” property and are very similar to a novel type of graph termed forest-reducible graph. We utilize this property to develop an iterative efficient approximation algorithm for learning the graph edges, where each iteration takes linear time. We compare our approximation algorithm to a recently-proposed state-of-the-art exact algorithm and show that it is more efficient and scalable both theoretically and empirically, while its output quality is close to that given by the optimal solution of the exact algorithm.</p><p>6 0.11582317 <a title="72-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Combining_Textual_Entailment_and_Argumentation_Theory_for_Supporting_Online_Debates_Interactions.html">53 acl-2012-Combining Textual Entailment and Argumentation Theory for Supporting Online Debates Interactions</a></p>

This can be seen as an application-oriented variant of textual entailment recognition where: i) T and H are in different languages, and ii) entailment relations between T and H have to be checked in both directions.

<p>Author: Meni Adler ; Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel text exploration model, which extends the scope of state-of-the-art technologies by moving from standard concept-based exploration to statement-based exploration. The proposed scheme utilizes the textual entailment relation between statements as the basis of the exploration process. A user of our system can explore the result space of a query by drilling down/up from one statement to another, according to entailment relations specified by an entailment graph and an optional concept taxonomy. As a prominent use case, we apply our exploration system and illustrate its benefit on the health-care domain. To the best of our knowledge this is the first implementation of an exploration system at the statement level that is based on the textual entailment relation. 1</p><p>3 0.7411539 <a title="72-lsi-3" href="./acl-2012-Crowdsourcing_Inference-Rule_Evaluation.html">65 acl-2012-Crowdsourcing Inference-Rule Evaluation</a></p>
<p>Author: Naomi Zeichner ; Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: The importance of inference rules to semantic applications has long been recognized and extensive work has been carried out to automatically acquire inference-rule resources. However, evaluating such resources has turned out to be a non-trivial task, slowing progress in the field. In this paper, we suggest a framework for evaluating inference-rule resources. Our framework simplifies a previously proposed “instance-based evaluation” method that involved substantial annotator training, making it suitable for crowdsourcing. We show that our method produces a large amount of annotations with high inter-annotator agreement for a low cost at a short period of time, without requiring training expert annotators.</p><p>4 0.71522081 <a title="72-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-Efficient_Tree-based_Approximation_for_Entailment_Graph_Learning.html">80 acl-2012-Efficient Tree-based Approximation for Entailment Graph Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan ; Meni Adler ; Jacob Goldberger</p><p>Abstract: Learning entailment rules is fundamental in many semantic-inference applications and has been an active field of research in recent years. In this paper we address the problem of learning transitive graphs that describe entailment rules between predicates (termed entailment graphs). We first identify that entailment graphs exhibit a “tree-like” property and are very similar to a novel type of graph termed forest-reducible graph. We utilize this property to develop an iterative efficient approximation algorithm for learning the graph edges, where each iteration takes linear time. We compare our approximation algorithm to a recently-proposed state-of-the-art exact algorithm and show that it is more efficient and scalable both theoretically and empirically, while its output quality is close to that given by the optimal solution of the exact algorithm.</p><p>5 0.62100726 <a title="72-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-Combining_Textual_Entailment_and_Argumentation_Theory_for_Supporting_Online_Debates_Interactions.html">53 acl-2012-Combining Textual Entailment and Argumentation Theory for Supporting Online Debates Interactions</a></p>

However, a user that wants to cut in on a debate may experience some difficulties in extracting the current accepted positions, and can be discouraged from interacting through these applications.

<p>Author: Xingyuan Peng ; Dengfeng Ke ; Bo Xu</p><p>Abstract: Conventional Automated Essay Scoring (AES) measures may cause severe problems when directly applied in scoring Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcription as they are error sensitive and unsuitable for the characteristic of ASR transcription. Therefore, we introduce a framework of Finite State Transducer (FST) to avoid the shortcomings. Compared with the Latent Semantic Analysis with Support Vector Regression (LSA-SVR) method (stands for the conventional measures), our FST method shows better performance especially towards the ASR transcription. In addition, we apply the synonyms similarity to expand the FST model. The final scoring performance reaches an acceptable level of 0.80 which is only 0.07 lower than the correlation (0.87) between human raters.</p><p>2 0.76218343 <a title="72-lda-2" href="./acl-2012-Event_Linking%3A_Grounding_Event_Reference_in_a_News_Archive.html">85 acl-2012-Event Linking: Grounding Event Reference in a News Archive</a></p>
<p>Author: Joel Nothman ; Matthew Honnibal ; Ben Hachey ; James R. Curran</p><p>Abstract: Interpreting news requires identifying its constituent events. Events are complex linguistically and ontologically, so disambiguating their reference is challenging. We introduce event linking, which canonically labels an event reference with the article where it was first reported. This implicitly relaxes coreference to co-reporting, and will practically enable augmenting news archives with semantic hyperlinks. We annotate and analyse a corpus of 150 documents, extracting 501 links to a news archive with reasonable inter-annotator agreement.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.7406497 <a title="72-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Detecting_Semantic_Equivalence_and_Information_Disparity_in_Cross-lingual_Documents.html">72 acl-2012-Detecting Semantic Equivalence and Information Disparity in Cross-lingual Documents</a></p>

<p>Author: Sungchul Kim ; Kristina Toutanova ; Hwanjo Yu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a method to automatically label multi-lingual data with named entity tags. We build on prior work utilizing Wikipedia metadata and show how to effectively combine the weak annotations stemming from Wikipedia metadata with information obtained through English-foreign language parallel Wikipedia sentences. The combination is achieved using a novel semi-CRF model for foreign sentence tagging in the context of a parallel English sentence. The model outperforms both standard annotation projection methods and methods based solely on Wikipedia metadata.</p><p>5 0.5241251 <a title="72-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-UWN%3A_A_Large_Multilingual_Lexical_Knowledge_Base.html">206 acl-2012-UWN: A Large Multilingual Lexical Knowledge Base</a></p>

This paper explains how link prediction, information integration and taxonomy induction methods have been used to build UWN based on WordNet and extend it with millions of named entities from Wikipedia. We additionally introduce extensions to cover lexical relationships, frame-semantic knowledge, and language data. An online interface provides human access to the data, while a software API enables applications to look up over 16 million words and names.</p><p>6 0.51621604 <a title="72-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Assessing_the_Effect_of_Inconsistent_Assessors_on_Summarization_Evaluation.html">29 acl-2012-Assessing the Effect of Inconsistent Assessors on Summarization Evaluation</a></p>

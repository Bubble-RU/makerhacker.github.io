</p><p>4 Techniques for decomposing Chinese characters and for comparing the similarity between Chinese characters were employed to recommend lists of Chinese characters for authoring the games. [sent-8, score-1.368]
</p><p>5 Evaluation of the authoring environment with 20 subjects showed that our system made the authoring of games more effective and efficient. [sent-9, score-0.922]
</p><p>6 1 Introduction Learning to read and write Chinese characters is a challenging task for learners of Chinese. [sent-10, score-0.482]
</p><p>7 The official agents in Taiwan and China, respectively, chose 5401 and 3755 characters as important basic characters in national standards. [sent-12, score-0.698]
</p><p>8 Consequently, the general public has gained the impression that it is not easy to read Chinese articles, because each of these thousands of characters is written in different ways. [sent-13, score-0.396]
</p><p>9 An instructor at the University of Michigan made up stories based on decomposed characters to help students remember their formations (Tao, 2007). [sent-15, score-0.552]
</p><p>10 For instance, “河”(he2, river) [Note: Chinese characters will be followed by their pronunciations, denoted in Hanyu pinyin, and, when necessary, an English translation. [sent-22, score-0.349]
</p><p>11 In addition to pictograms, more than 80% of Chinese characters are phonosemantic characters (PSCs, henceforth) (Ho and Bryant, 1997). [sent-32, score-0.698]
</p><p>12 Due to the shared PC, these four characters are pronounced in exactly the same way. [sent-36, score-0.382]
</p><p>13 The characters “檢”(jian3), “撿” (jian3), and “儉”(jian3) share their PCs on their right sides, but that PC is not a standalone Chinese character. [sent-39, score-0.383]
</p><p>14 Despite the differences among phoneme systems and among the degrees of strictness of the GPC rules in different languages, ample psycholinguistic evidences have shown that phonological awareness is a crucial factor in predicting students’ reading ability, e. [sent-50, score-0.223]
</p><p>15 This demonstration is unique on two aspects: (1) students play games that are designed to strengthen the association between Chinese PCs and the pronunciations of hosting characters and (2) teachers compile the games with tools that are supported by sublexical information in Chinese. [sent-59, score-1.75]
</p><p>16 The games aim  at implicitly informing players of the Chinese GPC rules, mimicking the process of how infants would apply statistical learning (Saffran et al. [sent-60, score-0.584]
</p><p>17 We evaluated the effectiveness of the game platform with 116 students between grade 1 and grade 6 in Taiwan, and found that the students made progress in the Chinese naming tasks. [sent-62, score-0.732]
</p><p>18 As we will show, it is not trivial to author games for learning a GPC rule to meet individualized teaching goals. [sent-63, score-0.549]
</p><p>19 For this reason, techniques reported in a previous ACL conference for decomposing and comparing Chinese characters were employed to assist the preparation of games (Liu et al. [sent-64, score-0.801]
</p><p>20 Results of our evaluation showed that the authoring tool facilitates the authoring process, improving both efficiency and effectiveness. [sent-66, score-0.54]
</p><p>21 We describe the learning games in Section 2, and report the evaluation results of the games in Section 3. [sent-67, score-0.848]
</p><p>22 The authoring tool is presented in Section 4, and its evaluation is discussed in Section 5. [sent-68, score-0.291]
</p><p>23 2  The Learning Games  A game platform should include several functional 2  most relevant to the demonstration. [sent-70, score-0.324]
</p><p>24 Figure 1 shows a screenshot when a player is playing the game. [sent-71, score-0.213]
</p><p>25 The target PC appears in the upper middle of the window (“里”(li3) in this example), and a character and an accompanying monster (one at a time) will pop up randomly from any of the six holes on the ground. [sent-73, score-0.289]
</p><p>26 The player will hear the pronunciation of the character (i. [sent-74, score-0.3]
</p><p>27 Players’ task is to hit the monsters for the characters that contain the shown PC. [sent-77, score-0.544]
</p><p>28 If the player  does not hit, the credit will remain the same. [sent-82, score-0.217]
</p><p>29 Players are ranked, in the Hall of Fame, according to their total credits to provide an incentive for them to play the game after school. [sent-83, score-0.405]
</p><p>30 In Figure 1, the player has to hit the monster before the monster disappears to get the credit. [sent-84, score-0.387]
</p><p>31 If the player does not act in time, the credit will not change. [sent-85, score-0.217]
</p><p>32 On ordinary computers, the player manipulates the mouse to hit the monster. [sent-86, score-0.281]
</p><p>33 1  Challenging Levels  At the time of logging into the game, players can choose two parameters: (1) class level: lower class (i. [sent-90, score-0.31]
</p><p>34 The characters for lower, middle, and upper classes vary in terms of frequency and complexity of the characters. [sent-97, score-0.409]
</p><p>35 A student can choose the upper class only if s/he is in the upper class or if s/he has gathered sufficient credits. [sent-98, score-0.298]
</p><p>36 Credits for challenging levels rameters affect how the credits are added or deducted when the players hit the monsters correctly or incorrectly, respectively. [sent-101, score-0.488]
</p><p>37 2  Feedback Information  The feedback informs the players what characters were correctly hit (“埋”(mai2), “理”(li3), “裡”(li3), and “鯉”(li3)), incorrectly hit  (“婷”(ting2) and “袖”(show4)), and should have been hit (“狸”(li2)). [sent-105, score-0.827]
</p><p>38 When the player moves mouse over these characters, a sample Chinese word that shows how the character is used in daily lives will show up in a vertical box near the middle (i. [sent-106, score-0.317]
</p><p>39 Clicking on the top tab (繼續玩) will take the player to the next game. [sent-111, score-0.215]
</p><p>40 The selection of the next PC is random in the current system, but we plan to make the switching from a game to another adaptive to the students’ performance in future systems. [sent-113, score-0.301]
</p><p>41 Clicking on the second tab (看排行) will see the player list in the Hall of Fame, clicking on the third tab (返回 主選單) will return to the main menu, and clicking on the fourth (加 分題) will lead to games for extra credits. [sent-114, score-0.775]
</p><p>42 We have extended our games to lead students to learning Chinese words from characters, and details will be illustrated during the demo. [sent-115, score-0.571]
</p><p>43 Number of participants The data structure of a game is simple. [sent-118, score-0.345]
</p><p>44 When compiling a game, a teacher selects the PC for the game, and prepares six characters that contain the PC (to be referred as an In-list henceforth) and four characters as distracter characters that do not contain the PC (to be referred as an Out-list henceforth). [sent-119, score-1.192]
</p><p>45 The simplest internal form of a game looks like {target PC= “里”, In-list= “裡理鯉浬哩鋰”, Out-list= “塊鰓嘿鉀” } . [sent-120, score-0.274]
</p><p>46 We can convert this structure into a game easily. [sent-121, score-0.274]
</p><p>47 Through this simple structure, teachers choose the PCs to teach with character combinations of different challenging levels. [sent-122, score-0.382]
</p><p>48 In a game, 10 characters will be presented to the player. [sent-124, score-0.349]
</p><p>49 3  Preliminary Evaluation and Analysis  The game platform was evaluated with 116 students, and was found to shorten students’ response  times in Chinese naming tasks. [sent-125, score-0.474]
</p><p>50 We taught students of the experimental group and showed them how to play the games in class hours before the break began. [sent-130, score-0.807]
</p><p>51 1, a player could choose the class level before the game begins. [sent-135, score-0.554]
</p><p>52 Hence, for example, it is possible for a lower class player to play the games designed for middle or even upper class levels to increase their credits faster. [sent-136, score-0.982]
</p><p>53 However, if the player is not competent, the credits may be deducted faster as well. [sent-137, score-0.3]
</p><p>54 In the evaluation, 20 PCs were used in the games for each  class level in Table 1. [sent-138, score-0.497]
</p><p>55 The number of correctly written Jhuyins for the characters was recorded. [sent-141, score-0.349]
</p><p>56 In RAN, participants read 20 Chinese characters as fast as they could, and their speeds and accuracies were recorded. [sent-142, score-0.513]
</p><p>57 After the one month evaluation period, the performance of the control group did not change significantly, except participants in the upper class. [sent-145, score-0.231]
</p><p>58 The only exception is that the  middle class in the experimental group achieved better CCRT results. [sent-153, score-0.204]
</p><p>59 The 4 lower class students were very young, so we conjectured that it was harder for them to remember the writing of Jhuyin symbols after the winter break. [sent-155, score-0.248]
</p><p>60 4  An Open Authoring Tool for the Games  Our game platform has attracted the attention of teachers of several elementary schools. [sent-160, score-0.495]
</p><p>61 To meet the teaching goals of teacher in different areas, we have to allow the teachers to compile their own games for their needs. [sent-161, score-0.829]
</p><p>62 In the current implementation, we choose to have six characters in the In-list and four characters in the Out-list. [sent-165, score-0.764]
</p><p>63 We  allow repeated characters when the qualified characters are not enough. [sent-166, score-0.734]
</p><p>64 This authoring process is far less trivial as it might seem to be. [sent-167, score-0.249]
</p><p>65 In a previous evaluation, even native speakers of Chinese found it challenging to list many qualified characters out of the sky. [sent-168, score-0.495]
</p><p>66 Identifying characters for the In-list of a PC is not easy, and finding the characters for the Out-list is even more challenging. [sent-171, score-0.698]
</p><p>67 Without considering the characters in In-list for the game, we might believe that “ 甲 ” (jia3) and “呈” (cheng2) look equally similar to “里”, so both are good distracters. [sent-173, score-0.349]
</p><p>68 Namely, given a PC to teach and a selected Inlist, the “quality” of the Out-list is dependent on  the characters in In-list. [sent-176, score-0.396]
</p><p>69 Out-lists of high quality influence the challenging levels of the games, and will become a crucial ingredient when we make the games adaptive to players’ competence. [sent-177, score-0.487]
</p><p>70 1 PC Selection In a realistic teaching situation, a teacher will be teaching new characters and would like to provide students games that are related to the structures of the new characters. [sent-179, score-1.171]
</p><p>71 Hence, it is most convenient for the teachers that our tool decomposes a given character and recommends the PC in the character. [sent-180, score-0.309]
</p><p>72 For instance, given “理”, we show the teacher that we could compile a game for “里”. [sent-181, score-0.383]
</p><p>73 This list includes more characters than most native speakers can produce for “里” within a short period. [sent-193, score-0.423]
</p><p>74 However, with a good scoring function to rank the characters, it is not hard to achieve quality recommendations by placing the characters that actually contain the target PCs on top of the recommendation. [sent-196, score-0.349]
</p><p>75 Given that “里” is the target PC and the above In-list, we can recommend characters that look like the correct characters, e. [sent-197, score-0.393]
</p><p>76 We employed similar techniques to recommend characters for In-lists and Out-lists. [sent-200, score-0.393]
</p><p>77 SalencOtiug-alscthraefo  ters for In-lists, but focused on the inclusion of target PCs in the decomposed characters to recommend characters for Out-lists. [sent-203, score-0.77]
</p><p>78 Again our recommendations for the Out-lists were not perfect, and different ranking functions affect the perceived usefulness of the authoring tools. [sent-204, score-0.249]
</p><p>79 Figure 3 shows the step to choose characters in the Out-list for characters in the In-list. [sent-205, score-0.73]
</p><p>80 In this ex-  ample, six characters for the In-list for the PC “ ” had been chosen, and were listed near the top: “搖遙謠瑤鷂搖”. [sent-206, score-0.383]
</p><p>81 Teachers can find characters that are similar to these six correct characters in separate pull-down lists. [sent-207, score-0.732]
</p><p>82 3  Game Management  We allow teachers to apply for accounts and prepare the games based on their own teaching goals. [sent-211, score-0.729]
</p><p>83 5  Evaluation of the Authoring Tool  We evaluated how well our tools can help teachers with 20 native speakers. [sent-213, score-0.205]
</p><p>84 The control group used only paper and pens to author the games, and the experimental group would  use our authoring tools. [sent-218, score-0.434]
</p><p>85 We informed and showed the experimental group how to use our tool, and members of the experimental group must follow an illustration to create a sample game before the evaluation began. [sent-219, score-0.444]
</p><p>86 A game needed 6 characters in the Inlist and 4 characters in the Out-list. [sent-228, score-0.972]
</p><p>87 The games authored by the evaluators were judged by psycholinguists who have experience in teaching. [sent-230, score-0.452]
</p><p>88 The experimental group outperformed the control group in both the quality of the games and in the time spent on the authoring task. [sent-234, score-0.858]
</p><p>89 Using the authoring tools helped the evaluators to achieved significantly higher scores for the Out-list. [sent-237, score-0.277]
</p><p>90 Indeed, it is not easy to find characters that (1) are similar to the characters in the In-list and (2) cannot contain the target PC. [sent-238, score-0.698]
</p><p>91 Due to the page limits, we could not present the complete authoring system, but hope to have the chance to show it during the demonstration. [sent-239, score-0.249]
</p><p>92 6  Concluding Remarks  We reported a game for strengthening the association of the phonetic components and the pronunciations of Chinese characters. [sent-240, score-0.409]
</p><p>93 Experimental results indicated that playing the games helped students shorten the response times in naming tasks. [sent-241, score-0.759]
</p><p>94 To make our platform more useable, we built an authoring tool so that teachers could prepare games that meet specific teaching goals. [sent-242, score-1.107]
</p><p>95 Evaluation of the tool with college and graduate students showed  that our system offered an efficient and effective environment for this authoring task. [sent-243, score-0.438]
</p><p>96 Currently, players of our games still have to choose challenge levels. [sent-244, score-0.588]
</p><p>97 In the near future, we wish to make the game adaptive to players’ competence by adopting more advanced techniques, including the introduction of “consistency values” 6 (Jared et al. [sent-245, score-0.301]

<p>Author: Ning Xi ; Guangchao Tang ; Xinyu Dai ; Shujian Huang ; Jiajun Chen</p><p>Abstract: The dominant practice of statistical machine translation (SMT) uses the same Chinese word segmentation specification in both alignment and translation rule induction steps in building Chinese-English SMT system, which may suffer from a suboptimal problem that word segmentation better for alignment is not necessarily better for translation. To tackle this, we propose a framework that uses two different segmentation specifications for alignment and translation respectively: we use Chinese character as the basic unit for alignment, and then convert this alignment to conventional word alignment for translation rule induction. Experimentally, our approach outperformed two baselines: fully word-based system (using word for both alignment and translation) and fully character-based system, in terms of alignment quality and translation performance. 1Introduction Chinese Word segmentation is a necessary step in Chinese-English statistical machine translation (SMT) because Chinese sentences do not delimit words by spaces. The key characteristic of a Chinese word segmenter is the segmentation specification1. As depicted in Figure 1(a), the dominant practice of SMT uses the same word segmentation for both word alignment and translation rule induction. For brevity, we will refer to the word segmentation of the bilingual corpus as word segmentation for alignment (WSA for short), because it determines the basic tokens for alignment; and refer to the word segmentation of the aligned corpus as word segmentation for rules (WSR for short), because it determines the basic tokens of translation 1 We hereafter use “word segmentation” for short. 285 (a) WSA=WSR (b) WSA≠WSR Figure 1. WSA and WSR in SMT pipeline rules2, which also determines how the translation rules would be matched by the source sentences. It is widely accepted that word segmentation with a higher F-score will not necessarily yield better translation performance (Chang et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008; Xiao et al., 2010). Therefore, many approaches have been proposed to learn word segmentation suitable for SMT. These approaches were either complicated (Ma et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2008; Ma and Way, 2009; Paul et al., 2010), or of high computational complexity (Chung and Gildea 2009; Duan et al., 2010). Moreover, they implicitly assumed that WSA and WSR should be equal. This requirement may lead to a suboptimal problem that word segmentation better for alignment is not necessarily better for translation. To tackle this, we propose a framework that uses different word segmentation specifications as WSA and WSR respectively, as shown Figure 1(b). We investigate a solution in this framework: first, we use Chinese character as the basic unit for alignment, viz. character alignment; second, we use a simple method (Elming and Habash, 2007) to convert the character alignment to conventional word alignment for translation rule induction. In the 2 Interestingly, word is also a basic token in syntax-based rules.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 analyzes the influences of WSA and WSR on SMT respectively; Section 3 discusses how to convert character alignment to word alignment; Section 4 presents experimental results, followed by conclusions and future work in section 5. 2 Understanding WSA and WSR We propose a solution to tackle the suboptimal problem: using Chinese character for alignment while using Chinese word for translation. Character alignment differs from conventional word alignment in the basic tokens of the Chinese side of the training corpus3. Table 1 compares the token distributions of character-based corpus (CCorpus) and word-based corpus (WCorpus). We see that the WCorpus has a longer-tailed distribution than the CCorpus. More than 70% of the unique tokens appear less than 5 times in WCorpus. However, over half of the tokens appear more than or equal to 5 times in the CCorpus. This indicates that modeling word alignment could suffer more from data sparsity than modeling character alignment. Table 2 shows the numbers of the unique tokens (#UT) and unique bilingual token pairs (#UTP) of the two corpora. Consider two extensively features, fertility and translation features, which are extensively used by many state-of-the-art word aligners. The number of parameters w.r.t. fertility features grows linearly with #UT while the number of parameters w.r.t. translation features grows linearly with #UTP. We compare #UT and #UTP of both corpora in Table 2. As can be seen, CCorpus has less UT and UTP than WCorpus, i.e. character alignment model has a compact parameterization than word alignment model, where the compactness of parameterization is shown very important in statistical modeling (Collins, 1999). Another advantage of character alignment is the reduction in alignment errors caused by word seg3 Several works have proposed to use character (letter) on both sides of the parallel corpus for SMT between similar (European) languages (Vilar et al., 2007; Tiedemann, 2009), however, Chinese is not similar to English. 286 Frequency Characters (%) Words (%) 1 27.22 45.39 2 11.13 14.61 3 6.18 6.47 4 4.26 4.32 5(+) 50.21 29.21 Table 1 Token distribution of CCorpus and WCorpus Stats. Characters Words #UT 9.7K 88.1K #UTP 15.8M 24.2M Table 2 #UT and #UTP in CCorpus and WCorpus mentation errors. For example, “切尼 (Cheney)” and “愿 (will)” are wrongly merged into one word 切 尼 by the word segmenter, and 切 尼 wrongly aligns to a comma in English sentence in the word alignment; However, both 切 and 尼 align to “Cheney” correctly in the character alignment. However, this kind of errors cannot be fixed by methods which learn new words by packing already segmented words, such as word packing (Ma et al., 2007) and Pseudo-word (Duan et al., 2010). As character could preserve more meanings than word in Chinese, it seems that a character can be wrongly aligned to many English words by the aligner. However, we found this can be avoided to a great extent by the basic features (co-occurrence and distortion) used by many alignment models. For example, we observed that the four characters of the non-compositional word “阿拉法特 (Arafat)” align to Arafat correctly, although these characters preserve different meanings from that of Arafat. This can be attributed to the frequent co-occurrence (192 愿 愿 times) of these characters and Arafat in CCorpus. Moreover, 法 usually means France in Chinese, thus it may co-occur very often with France in CCorpus. If both France and Arafat appear in the English sentence, 法 may wrongly align to France. However, if 阿 aligns to Arafat, 法 will probably align to Arafat, because aligning 法 to Arafat could result in a lower distortion cost than aligning it to France. Different from alignment, translation is a pattern matching procedure (Lopez, 2008). WSR determines how the translation rules would be matched by the source sentences. For example, if we use translation rules with character as WSR to translate name entities such as the non-compositional word 阿拉法特, i.e. translating literally, we may get a wrong translation. That’s because the linguistic knowledge that the four characters convey a specific meaning different from the characters has been lost, which cannot always be totally recovered even by using phrase in phrase-based SMT systems (see Chang et al. (2008) for detail). Duan et al. (2010) and Paul et al., (2010) further pointed out that coarser-grained segmentation of the source sentence do help capture more contexts in translation. Therefore, rather than using character, using coarser-grained, at least as coarser as the conventional word, as WSR is quite necessary. 3 Converting Character Alignment to Word Alignment In order to use word as WSR, we employ the same method as Elming and Habash (2007)4 to convert the character alignment (CA) to its word-based version (CA ’) for translation rule induction. The conversion is very intuitive: for every English-Chinese word pair ??, ?? in the sentence pair, we align ? to ? as a link in CA ’, if and only if there is at least one Chinese character of ? aligns to ? in CA. Given two different segmentations A and B of the same sentence, it is easy to prove that if every word in A is finer-grained than the word of B at the corresponding position, the conversion is unambiguity (we omit the proof due to space limitation). As character is a finer-grained than its original word, character alignment can always be converted to alignment based on any word segmentation. Therefore, our approach can be naturally scaled to syntax-based system by converting character alignment to word alignment where the word seg- mentation is consistent with the parsers. We compare CA with the conventional word alignment (WA) as follows: We hand-align some sentence pairs as the evaluation set based on characters (ESChar), and converted it to the evaluation set based on word (ESWord) using the above conversion method. It is worth noting that comparing CA and WA by evaluating CA on ESChar and evaluating WA on ESWord is meaningless, because the basic tokens in CA and WA are different. However, based on the conversion method, comparing CA with WA can be accomplished by evaluating both CA ’ and WA on ESWord. 4 They used this conversion for word alignment combination only, no translation results were reported. 287 4 Experiments 4.1 Setup FBIS corpus (LDC2003E14) (210K sentence pairs) was used for small-scale task. A large bilingual corpus of our lab (1.9M sentence pairs) was used for large-scale task. The NIST’06 and NIST’08 test sets were used as the development set and test set respectively. The Chinese portions of all these data were preprocessed by character segmenter (CHAR), ICTCLAS word segmenter5 (ICT) and Stanford word segmenters with CTB and PKU specifications6 respectively. The first 100 sentence pairs of the hand-aligned set in Haghighi et al. (2009) were hand-aligned as ESChar, which is converted to three ESWords based on three segmentations respectively. These ESWords were appended to training corpus with the corresponding word segmentation for evaluation purpose. Both character and word alignment were performed by GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) enhanced with gdf heuristics to combine bidirectional alignments (Koehn et al., 2003). A 5-gram language model was trained from the Xinhua portion of Gigaword corpus. A phrase-based MT decoder similar to (Koehn et al., 2007) was used with the decoding weights optimized by MERT (Och, 2003). 4.2 Evaluation We first evaluate the alignment quality. The method discussed in section 3 was used to compare character and word alignment. As can be seen from Table 3, the systems using character as WSA outperformed the ones using word as WSA in both small-scale (row 3-5) and large-scale task (row 6-8) with all segmentations. This gain can be attributed to the small vocabulary size (sparsity) for character alignment. The observation is consistent with Koehn (2005) which claimed that there is a negative correlation between the vocabulary size and translation performance without explicitly distinguishing WSA and WSR. We then evaluated the translation performance. The baselines are fully word-based MT systems (WordSys), i.e. using word as both WSA and WSR, and fully character-based systems (CharSys).

Significant testing was carried out using bootstrap re-sampling method proposed by Koehn (2004) with a 95% confidence level. We see that our proposed systems outperformed WordSys in all segmentation specifications settings. Table 5 lists the results of CharSys in small-scale task. In this setting, we gradually set the phrase length and the distortion limits of the phrase-based decoder (context size) to 7, 9, 11 and 13, in order to remove the disadvantage of shorter context size of using character as WSR for fair comparison with WordSys as suggested by Duan et al. (2010). Comparing Table 4 and 5, we see that all CharSys underperformed WordSys. This observation is consistent with Chang et al. (2008) which claimed that using characters, even with large phrase length (up to 13 in our experiment) cannot always capture everything a Chinese word segmenter can do, and using word for translation is quite necessary. We also see that CharSys underperformed our proposed systems, that’s because the harm of using character as WSR outweighed the benefit of using character as WSA, which indicated that word segmentation better for alignment is not necessarily better for translation, and vice versa. We finally compared our approaches to Ma et al. (2007) and Ma and Way (2009), which proposed “packed word (PW)” and “bilingual motivated word (BS)” respectively. Both methods iteratively learn word segmentation and alignment alternatively, with the former starting from word-based corpus and the latter starting from characters-based corpus. Therefore, PW can be experimented on all segmentations. Table 6 lists their results in small- 288 Context Size 7 9 11 13 BLEU 20.90 21.19 20.89 21.09 Table 5 Translation evaluation of CharSys.

This may be attributed to the low recall of the learned BS or PW in their approaches. BS underperformed both two baselines, one reason is that Ma and Way (2009) also employed word lattice decoding techniques (Dyer et al., 2008) to tackle the low recall of BS, which was removed from our experiments for fair comparison. Interestingly, we found that using character as WSA and BS as WSR (Char+BS), a moderate gain (+0.43 point) was achieved compared with fully BS-based system; and using character as WSA and PW as WSR (Char+PW), significant gains were achieved compared with fully PW-based system, the result of CTB segmentation in this setting even outperformed our proposed approach (+0.42 point). This observation indicated that in our framework, better combinations of WSA and WSR can be found to achieve better translation performance. 5 Conclusions and Future Work We proposed a SMT framework that uses character for alignment and word for translation, which improved both alignment quality and translation performance. We believe that in this framework, using other finer-grained segmentation, with fewer ambiguities than character, would better parameterize the alignment models, while using other coarser-grained segmentation as WSR can help capture more linguistic knowledge than word to get better translation. We also believe that our approach, if integrated with combination techniques (Dyer et al., 2008; Xi et al., 2011), can yield better results. Acknowledgments We thank ACL reviewers.

The knowledge about the grapheme-phoneme conversion (GPC) rules of languages has been shown to be highly correlated to the ability of reading alphabetic languages and Chinese. We build and will demo a game platform for strengthening the association of phonological components in Chinese characters with the pronunciations of the characters. Results of a preliminary evaluation of our games indicated significant improvement in learners’ response times in Chinese naming tasks. In addition, we construct a Webbased open system for teachers to prepare their own games to best meet their teaching goals. Techniques for decomposing Chinese characters and for comparing the similarity between Chinese characters were employed to recommend lists of Chinese characters for authoring the games. Evaluation of the authoring environment with 20 subjects showed that our system made the authoring of games more effective and efficient.</p><p>2 0.59989429 <a title="26-lsi-2" href="./acl-2012-Unsupervized_Word_Segmentation%3A_the_Case_for_Mandarin_Chinese.html">210 acl-2012-Unsupervized Word Segmentation: the Case for Mandarin Chinese</a></p>

Following Harris's Hypothesis in Kempe (1999) and Tanaka-Ishii's (2005) reformulation, we base our work on the Variation of Branching Entropy. We improve on (Jin and Tanaka-Ishii, 2006) by adding normalization and viterbidecoding. This enable us to remove most of the thresholds and parameters from their model and to reach near state-of-the-art results (Wang et al., 201 1) with a simpler system. We provide evaluation on different corpora available from the Segmentation bake-off II (Emerson, 2005) and define a more precise topline for the task using cross-trained supervized system available off-the-shelf (Zhang and Clark, 2010; Zhao and Kit, 2008; Huang and Zhao, 2007)</p><p>3 0.50947601 <a title="26-lsi-3" href="./acl-2012-A_Corpus_of_Textual_Revisions_in_Second_Language_Writing.html">8 acl-2012-A Corpus of Textual Revisions in Second Language Writing</a></p>

The knowledge about the grapheme-phoneme conversion (GPC) rules of languages has been shown to be highly correlated to the ability of reading alphabetic languages and Chinese. We build and will demo a game platform for strengthening the association of phonological components in Chinese characters with the pronunciations of the characters. Results of a preliminary evaluation of our games indicated significant improvement in learners’ response times in Chinese naming tasks. In addition, we construct a Webbased open system for teachers to prepare their own games to best meet their teaching goals. Techniques for decomposing Chinese characters and for comparing the similarity between Chinese characters were employed to recommend lists of Chinese characters for authoring the games. Evaluation of the authoring environment with 20 subjects showed that our system made the authoring of games more effective and efficient.</p><p>2 0.88329166 <a title="26-lda-2" href="./acl-2012-A_Meta_Learning_Approach_to_Grammatical_Error_Correction.html">15 acl-2012-A Meta Learning Approach to Grammatical Error Correction</a></p>

<p>Author: Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil ; Justin Cheng ; Jon Kleinberg ; Lillian Lee</p><p>Abstract: Understanding the ways in which information achieves widespread public awareness is a research question of significant interest. We consider whether, and how, the way in which the information is phrased the choice of words and sentence structure — can affect this process. To this end, we develop an analysis framework and build a corpus of movie quotes, annotated with memorability information, in which we are able to control for both the speaker and the setting of the quotes. We find that there are significant differences between memorable and non-memorable quotes in several key dimensions, even after controlling for situational and contextual factors. One is lexical distinctiveness: in aggregate, memorable quotes use less common word choices, but at the same time are built upon a scaffolding of common syntactic patterns. Another is that memorable quotes tend to be more general in ways that make them easy to apply in new contexts — that is, more portable. — We also show how the concept of “memorable language” can be extended across domains. 1 Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. Understanding what items will be retained in the public consciousness, and why, is a question of fundamental interest in many domains, including marketing, politics, entertainment, and social media; as we all know, many items barely register, whereas others catch on and take hold in many people’s minds. An active line of recent computational work has employed a variety of perspectives on this question. 892 Building on a foundation in the sociology of diffusion [27, 31], researchers have explored the ways in which network structure affects the way information spreads, with domains of interest including blogs [1, 11], email [37], on-line commerce [22], and social media [2, 28, 33, 38]. There has also been recent research addressing temporal aspects of how different media sources convey information [23, 30, 39] and ways in which people react differently to infor- mation on different topics [28, 36]. Beyond all these factors, however, one’s everyday experience with these domains suggests that the way in which a piece of information is expressed the choice of words, the way it is phrased might also have a fundamental effect on the extent to which it takes hold in people’s minds. Concepts that attain wide reach are often carried in messages such as political slogans, marketing phrases, or aphorisms whose language seems intuitively to be memorable, “catchy,” or otherwise compelling. Our first challenge in exploring this hypothesis is to develop a notion of “successful” language that is precise enough to allow for quantitative evaluation. We also face the challenge of devising an evaluation setting that separates the phrasing of a message from the conditions in which it was delivered highlycited quotes tend to have been delivered under compelling circumstances or fit an existing cultural, political, or social narrative, and potentially what appeals to us about the quote is really just its invocation of these extra-linguistic contexts. Is the form of the language adding an effect beyond or independent of these (obviously very crucial) factors? To — — — investigate the question, one needs a way of controlProce dJienjgus, R ofep thueb 5lic0t hof A Knonruea ,l M 8-e1e4ti Jnugly o f2 t0h1e2 A.s ?c so2c0ia1t2io Ans fso rc Ciatoiomnp fuotart Cio nmaplu Ltiantgiounisatlic Lsi,n pgaugiestsi8c 9s2–901, ling as much as possible for the role that the surrounding context of the language plays. — — The present work (i): Evaluating language-based memorability Defining what makes an utterance memorable is subtle, and scholars in several domains have written about this question. There is a rough consensus that an appropriate definition involves elements of both recognition people should be able to retain the quote and recognize it when they hear it invoked and production people should be motivated to refer to it in relevant situations [15]. One suggested reason for why some memes succeed is their ability to provoke emotions [16]. Alternatively, memorable quotes can be good for expressing the feelings, mood, or situation of an individual, a group, or a culture (the zeitgeist): “Certain quotes exquisitely capture the mood or feeling we wish to communicate to someone. We hear them ... and store them away for future use” [10]. None of these observations, however, serve as definitions, and indeed, we believe it desirable to — — — not pre-commit to an abstract definition, but rather to adopt an operational formulation based on external human judgments. In designing our study, we focus on a domain in which (i) there is rich use of language, some of which has achieved deep cultural penetration; (ii) there already exist a large number of external human judgments perhaps implicit, but in a form we can extract; and (iii) we can control for the setting in which the text was used. Specifically, we use the complete scripts of roughly 1000 movies, representing diverse genres, eras, and levels of popularity, and consider which lines are the most “memorable”. To acquire memorability labels, for each sentence in each script, we determine whether it has been listed as a “memorable quote” by users of the widely-known IMDb (the Internet Movie Database), and also estimate the number oftimes it appears on the Web. Both ofthese serve as memorability metrics for our purposes. When we evaluate properties of memorable quotes, we comparethemwithquotes thatarenotassessed as memorable, but were spoken by the same character, at approximately the same point in the same movie. This enables us to control in a fairly — fine-grained way for the confounding effects of context discussed above: we can observe differences 893 that persist even after taking into account both the speaker and the setting. In a pilot validation study, we find that human subjects are effective at recognizing the more IMDbmemorable of two quotes, even for movies they have not seen. This motivates a search for features intrinsic to the text of quotes that signal memorability. In fact, comments provided by the human subjects as part of the task suggested two basic forms that such textual signals could take: subjects felt that (i) memorable quotes often involve a distinctive turn of phrase; and (ii) memorable quotes tend to invoke general themes that aren’t tied to the specific setting they came from, and hence can be more easily invoked for future (out of context) uses. We test both of these principles in our analysis of the data. The present work (ii): What distinguishes memorable quotes Under the controlled-comparison setting sketched above, we find that memorable quotes exhibit significant differences from nonmemorable quotes in several fundamental respects, and these differences in the data reinforce the two main principles from the human pilot study. First, we show a concrete sense in which memorable quotes are indeed distinctive: with respect to lexical language models trained on the newswire portions of the Brown corpus [21], memorable quotes have significantly lower likelihood than their nonmemorable counterparts. Interestingly, this distinctiveness takes place at the level of words, but not at the level of other syntactic features: the part-ofspeech composition of memorable quotes is in fact more likely with respect to newswire. Thus, we can think of memorable quotes as consisting, in an aggregate sense, of unusual word choices built on a scaffolding of common part-of-speech patterns. We also identify a number of ways in which memorable quotes convey greater generality. In their patterns of verb tenses, personal pronouns, and determiners, memorable quotes are structured so as to be more “free-standing,” containing fewer markers that indicate references to nearby text. Memorable quotes differ in other interesting as- pects as well, such as sound distributions. Our analysis ofmemorable movie quotes suggests a framework by which the memorability of text in a range of different domains could be investigated. We provide evidence that such cross-domain properties may hold, guided by one of our motivating applications in marketing. In particular, we analyze a corpus of advertising slogans, and we show that these slogans have significantly greater likelihood at both the word level and the part-of-speech level with respect to a language model trained on memorable movie quotes, compared to a corresponding language model trained on non-memorable movie quotes. This suggests that some of the principles underlying memorable text have the potential to apply across different areas.

Following [8], we constructed a corpus consisting of all lines from roughly 1000 movies, varying in genre, era, and popularity; for each movie, we then extracted the list of quotes from IMDb’s Memorable Quotes page corresponding to the movie.1 A memorable quote in IMDb can appear either as an individual sentence spoken by one character, or as a multi-sentence line, or as a block of dialogue involving multiple characters. In the latter two cases, it can be hard to determine which particular portion is viewed as memorable (some involve a build-up to a punch line; others involve the follow-through after a well-phrased opening sentence), and so we focus in our comparisons on those memorable quotes that 1This extraction involved some edit-distance-based alignment, since the exact form of the line in the script can exhibit minor differences from the version typed into IMDb. rmotuqsfebmaNerolbm543281760 0 1234D5ecil678910 894 Figure 1: Location of memorable quotes in each decile of movie scripts (the first 10th, the second 10th, etc.), summed over all movies. The same qualitative results hold if we discard each movie’s very first and last line, which might have privileged status. appear as a single sentence rather than a multi-line block.2 We now formulate a task that we can use to evaluate the features of memorable quotes. Recall that our goal is to identify effects based in the language of the quotes themselves, beyond any factors arising from the speaker or context. Thus, for each (singlesentence) memorable quote M, we identify a nonmemorable quote that is as similar as possible to M in all characteristics but the choice of words. This means we want it to be spoken by the same character in the same movie. It also means that we want it to have the same length: controlling for length is important because we expect that on average, shorter quotes will be easier to remember than long quotes, and that wouldn’t be an interesting textual effect to report. Moreover, we also want to control for the fact that a quote’s position in a movie can affect memorability: certain scenes produce more memorable dialogue, and as Figure 1 demonstrates, in aggregate memorable quotes also occur disproportionately near the beginnings and especially the ends of movies. In summary, then, for each M, we pick a contrasting (single-sentence) quote N from the same movie that is as close in the script as possible to M (either before or after it), subject to the conditions that (i) M and N are uttered by the same speaker, (ii) M and N have the same number of words, and (iii) N does not occur in the IMDb list of memorable 2We also ran experiments relaxing the single-sentence assumption, which allows for stricter scene control and a larger dataset but complicates comparisons involving syntax. The non-syntax results were in line with those reported here.

(Contractions character, have the same length, and one is labeled memorable by the IMDb such as “it’s” count as two words.) quotes for the movie (either as a single line or as part of a larger block). Given such pairs, we formulate a pairwise comparison task: given M and N, determine which is the memorable quote. Psychological research on subjective evaluation [35], as well as initial experiments using ourselves as subjects, indicated that this pairwise set-up easier to work with than simply presenting a single sentence and asking whether it is memorable or not; the latter requires agreement on an “absolute” criterion for memorability that is very hard to impose consistently, whereas the former simply requires a judgment that one quote is more memorable than another. Our main dataset, available at http://www.cs. cornell.edu/∼cristian/memorability.html,3 thus consists of approximately 2200 such (M, N) pairs, separated by a median of 5 same-character lines in the script. The reader can get a sense for the nature of the data from the three examples in Table 1. We now discuss two further aspects to the formulation of the experiment: a preliminary pilot study involving human subjects, and the incorporation of search engine counts into the data. 2.2 Pilot study: Human performance As a preliminary consideration, we did a small pilot study to see if humans can distinguish memorable from non-memorable quotes, assuming our IMDBinduced labels as gold standard. Six subjects, all native speakers of English and none an author of this paper, were presented with 11 or 12 pairs of memorable vs. non-memorable quotes; again, we controlled for extra-textual effects by ensuring that in each pair the two quotes come from the same movie, are by the same character, have the same length, and 3Also available there: other examples and factoids. 895 Table 2: Human pilot study: number of matches to IMDb-induced annotation, ordered by decreasing match percentage. For the null hypothesis of random guessing, these results are statistically significant, p < 2−6 ≈ .016. appear as nearly as possible in the same scene.4 The order of quotes within pairs was randomized. Importantly, because we wanted to understand whether the language of the quotes by itself contains signals about memorability, we chose quotes from movies that the subjects said they had not seen. (This means that each subject saw a different set of quotes.) Moreover, the subjects were requested not to consult any external sources of information.5 The reader is welcome to try a demo version of the task at http: //www.cs.cornell.edu/∼cristian/memorability.html. Table 2 shows that all the subjects performed (sometimes much) better than chance, and against the null hypothesis that all subjects are guessing randomly, the results are statistically significant, p < 2−6 ≈ .016.

We do note, though, that after our research was completed and as of Apr. 26, 2012, ≈ 11,300 people completed the online test: average accuracy: 27,2 ≈%, 1 1m,3o0d0e npueompbleer c coomrrpelcett:e d9 t/1he2. induced labels with some reliability.6 2.3 Incorporating search engine counts Thus far we have discussed a dataset in which memorability is determined through an explicit labeling drawn from the IMDb. Given the “production” aspect of memorability discussed in § 1, we stihoonu”ld a saplesoc expect tmhaotr mabeimlityora dbislce quotes nw §il1l ,te wnde to appear more extensively on Web pages than nonmemorable quotes; note that incorporating this insight makes it possible to use the (implicit) judgments of a much larger number of people than are represented by the IMDb database. It therefore makes sense to try using search-engine result counts as a second indication of memorability. We experimented with several ways of constructing memorability information from search-engine counts, but this proved challenging. Searching for a quote as a stand-alone phrase runs into the problem that a number of quotes are also sentences that people use without the movie in mind, and so high counts for such quotes do not testify to the phrase’s status as a memorable quote from the movie. On the other hand, searching for the quote in a Boolean conjunction with the movie’s title discards most of these uses, but also eliminates a large fraction of the appearances on the Web that we want to find: precisely because memorable quotes tend to have widespread cultural usage, people generally don’t feel the need to include the movie’s title when invoking them. Finally, since we are dealing with roughly 1000 movies, the result counts vary over an enormous range, from recent blockbusters to movies with relatively small fan bases. In the end, we found that it was more effective to use the result counts in conjunction with the IMDb labels, so that the counts played the role of an additional filter rather than a free-standing numerical value. Thus, for each pair (M, N) produced using the IMDb methodology above, we searched for each of M and N as quoted expressions in a Boolean conjunction with the title of the movie. We then kept only those pairs for which M (i) produced more than five results in our (quoted, conjoined) search, and (ii) produced at least twice as many results as the cor6The average accuracy being below 100% reinforces that context is very important, too. 896 responding search for N. We created a version of this filtered dataset using each of Google and Bing, and all the main findings were consistent with the results on the IMDb-only dataset. Thus, in what follows, we will focus on the main IMDb-only dataset, discussing the relationship to the dataset filtered by search engine counts where relevant (in which case we will refer to the +Google dataset). 3 Never send a human to do a machine’s job. We now discuss experiments that investigate the hypotheses discussed in §1. In particular, we devise pmoetthheosdess t dhiastc can assess 1th.e Idnis ptianrcttiicvuelnaer,ss w aend d generality hypotheses and test whether there exists a notion of “memorable language” that operates across domains. In addition, we evaluate and compare the predictive power of these hypotheses. 3.1 Distinctiveness One of the hypotheses we examine is whether the use of language in memorable quotes is to some extent unusual. In order to quantify the level of distinctiveness of a quote, we take a language-model approach: we model “common language” using the newswire sections of the Brown corpus [21]7, and evaluate how distinctive a quote is by evaluating its likelihood with respect to this model the lower the likelihood, the more distinctive. In order to assess different levels of lexical and syntactic distinctiveness, we employ a total of six Laplacesmoothed8 language models: 1-gram, 2-gram, and — 3-gram word LMs and 1-gram, 2-gram and 3-gram LMs. We find strong evidence that from a lexical perspective, memorable quotes are more distinctive than their non-memorable counterparts. As indicated in Table 3, for each of our lexical “common language” models, in about 60% of the quote pairs, the memorable quote is more distinctive. Interestingly, the reverse is true when it comes to part-of-speech9 7Results were qualitatively similar if we used the fiction portions. The age of the Brown corpus makes it less likely to contain modern movie quotes. 8We employ Laplace (additive) smoothing with a smoothing parameter of 0.2. The language models’ vocabulary was that of the entire training corpus. 9Throughout we obtain part-of-speech tags by using the NLTK maximum entropy tagger with default parameters. in which the the memorable quote is more distinctive than the non-memorable one according to the respective “common language” model. Significance according to a two-tailed sign test is indicated using *-notation (∗∗∗=“p<.001”). syntax: memorable quotes appear to follow the syntactic patterns of “common language” as closely as or more closely than non-memorable quotes. Together, these results suggest that memorable quotes consist of unusual word sequences built on common syntactic scaffolding. 3.2 Generality Another of our hypotheses is that memorable quotes are easier to use outside the specific context in which they were uttered that is, more “portable” and therefore exhibit fewer terms that refer to those settings. We use the following syntactic properties as proxies for the generality of a quote: • Fewer 3rd-person pronouns, since these commonly r 3efer to a person or object that was introduced earlier in the discourse. Utterances that employ fewer such pronouns are easier to adapt to new contexts, and so will be considered more — — general. • More indefinite articles like a and an, since they are more likely ttioc lreesfer li ktoe general concepts than definite articles. Quotes with more indefinite articles will be considered more general. Fewer past tense verbs and more present tFeenwsee verbs, tseinncsee t vheer bfosrm aenrd are more likely to refer to specific previous events. Therefore utterances that employ fewer past tense verbs (and more present tense verbs) will be considered more general.

Pairs where the metric does not distinguish between the quotes are not considered. quote pairs for which the memorable quote scores better on the generality metric. Note that because the issue of generality is a complex one for which there is no straightforward single metric, our approach here is based on several proxies for generality, considered independently; yet, as the results show, all of these point in a consistent direction. It is an interesting open question to develop richer ways of assessing whether a quote has greater generality, in the sense that people intuitively attribute to memorable quotes. 3.3 “Memorable” language beyond movies One of the motivating questions in our analysis is whether there are general principles underlying “memorable language.” The results thus far suggest potential families of such principles. A further question in this direction is whether the notion of memorability can be extended across different domains, and for this we collected (and distribute on our website) 431 phrases that were explicitly designed to be memorable: advertising slogans (e.g., “Quality never goes out of style.”). The focus on slogans is also in keeping with one of the initial motivations in studying memorability, namely, marketing applications in other words, assessing whether a proposed slogan has features that are consistent with memorable text. The fact that it’s not clear how to construct a collection of “non-memorable” counterparts to slogans appears to pose a technical challenge. However, we can still use a language-modeling approach to assess whether the textual properties of the slogans are closer to the memorable movie quotes (as one would conjecture) or to the non-memorable movie quotes. Specifically, we train one language model on memorable quotes and another on non-memorable quotes — guage: percentage of slogans that have higher likelihood under the memorable language model than under the nonmemorable one (for each of the six language models considered). Rightmost column: for reference, the percentage of newswire sentences that have higher likelihood under the memorable language model than under the nonmemorable one.

(%s of 3rd pers. pronouns and indefinite articles are relative to all tokens, %s of past tense are relative to all past and present verbs.) and compare how likely each slogan is to be produced according to these two models. As shown in the middle column of Table 5, we find that slogans are better predicted both lexically and syntactically by the former model. This result thus offers evidence for a concept of “memorable language” that can be applied beyond a single domain. We also note that the higher likelihood of slogans under a “memorable language” model is not simply occurring for the trivial reason that this model predicts all other large bodies of text better. In particular, the newswire section of the Brown corpus is predicted better at the lexical level by the language model trained on non-memorable quotes. Finally, Table 6 shows that slogans employ general language, in the sense that for each of our generality metrics, we see a slogans/memorablequotes/non-memorable quotes spectrum. 3.4 Prediction task We now show how the principles discussed above can provide features for a basic prediction task, corresponding to the task in our human pilot study: 898 given a pair of quotes, identify the memorable one. Our first formulation of the prediction task uses a standard bag-of-words model10. If there were no information in the textual content of a quote to determine whether it were memorable, then an SVM employing bag-of-words features should perform no better than chance. Instead, though, it obtains 59.67% (10-fold cross-validation) accuracy, as shown in Table 7. We then develop models using features based on the measures formulated earlier in this section: generality measures (the four listed in Table 4); distinctiveness measures (likelihood according to 1, 2, and 3-gram “common language” models at the lexical and part-of-speech level for each quote in the pair, their differences, and pairwise comparisons between them); and similarityto-slogans measures (likelihood according to 1, 2, and 3-gram slogan-language models at the lexical and part-of-speech level for each quote in the pair, their differences, and pairwise comparisons between them). Even a relatively small number of distinctiveness features, on their own, improve significantly over the much larger bag-of-words model. When we include additional features based on generality and language-model features measuring similarity to slogans, the performance improves further (last line of Table 7). Thus, the main conclusion from these prediction tasks is that abstracting notions such as distinctiveness and generality can produce relatively streamlined models that outperform much heavier-weight bag-of-words models, and can suggest steps toward approaching the performance of human judges who very much unlike our system have the full cultural context in which movies occur at their disposal. — — 3.5 Other characteristics We also made some auxiliary observations that may be ofinterest. Specifically, we find differences in letter and sound distribution (e.g., memorable quotes after curse-word removal use significantly more “front sounds” (labials or front vowels such as represented by the letter i) and significantly fewer “back sounds” such as the one represented by u),11 — — 10We discarded terms appearing fewer than 10 times. 11These findings may relate to marketing research on sound symbolism [7, 19, 40].

Accuracies statistically significantly greater than bag-of-words according to a two-tailed t-test are indicated with *(p<.05) and **(p<.01). word complexity (e.g., memorable quotes use words with significantly more syllables) and phrase complexity (e.g., memorable quotes use fewer coordinating conjunctions). The latter two are in line with our distinctiveness hypothesis. 4 A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away How an item’s linguistic form affects the reaction it generates has been studied in several contexts, including evaluations of product reviews [9], political speeches [12], on-line posts [13], scientific papers [14], and retweeting of Twitter posts [36]. We use a different set of features, abstracting the notions of distinctiveness and generality, in order to focus on these higher-level aspects of phrasing rather than on particular lower-level features. Related to our interest in distinctiveness, work in advertising research has studied the effect of syntactic complexity on recognition and recall of slogans [5, 6, 24]. There may also be connections to Von Restorff’s isolation effect Hunt [17], which asserts that when all but one item in a list are similar in some way, memory for the different item is enhanced. Related to our interest in generality, Knapp et al. [20] surveyed subjects regarding memorable messages or pieces of advice they had received, finding that the ability to be applied to multiple concrete situations was an important factor. Memorability, although distinct from “memorizability”, relates to short- and long-term recall. Thorn and Page [34] survey sub-lexical, lexical, and semantic attributes affecting short-term memorability of lexical items. Studies of verbatim recall have also considered the task of distinguishing an exact quote from close paraphrases [3]. Investigations of longterm recall have included studies ofculturally signif- 899 icant passages of text [29] and findings regarding the effect of rhetorical devices of alliterative [4], “rhythmic, poetic, and thematic constraints” [18, 26]. Finally, there are complex connections between humor and memory [32], which may lead to interactions with computational humor recognition [25]. 5 I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Motivated by the broad question of what kinds of information achieve widespread public awareness, we studied the the effect of phrasing on a quote’s memorability. A challenge is that quotes differ not only in how they are worded, but also in who said them and under what circumstances; to deal with this difficulty, we constructed a controlled corpus of movie quotes in which lines deemed memorable are paired with non-memorable lines spoken by the same character at approximately the same point in the same movie. After controlling for context and situation, memorable quotes were still found to exhibit, on av- erage (there will always be individual exceptions), significant differences from non-memorable quotes in several important respects, including measures capturing distinctiveness and generality. Our experiments with slogans show how the principles we identify can extend to a different domain. Future work may lead to applications in marketing, advertising and education [4]. Moreover, the subtle nature of memorability, and its connection to research in psychology, suggests a range of further research directions. We believe that the framework developed here can serve as the basis for further computational studies of the process by which information takes hold in the public consciousness, and the role that language effects play in this process.

</p><p>6 It is even not uncommon that the big group of discussants split into two or more smaller subgroups. [sent-11, score-0.204]
</p><p>7 The members of each subgroup have the same opinion toward the discission topic. [sent-12, score-0.561]
</p><p>8 The member of a subgroup is more likely to show positive attitude to the members of the same subgroup, and negative attitude to the members of opposing subgroups. [sent-13, score-1.713]

</p><p>12 The writer of (2) is expressing negative attitude (disagreement) towards the writer of (1) and negative attitude with respect to the idea of school uniform. [sent-25, score-1.538]
</p><p>13 It is clear from this short dialog that the writer of (1) and the writer of (2) are members of two opposing subgroups. [sent-26, score-0.341]
</p><p>14 In this demo, we present an unsupervised system for determining the subgroup membership of each  participant in a discussion. [sent-28, score-0.441]
</p><p>15 We use linguistic techniques to identify attitude expressions, their polarities, and their targets. [sent-29, score-0.614]
</p><p>16 We use sentiment analysis techniques to identify opinion expressions. [sent-30, score-0.32]
</p><p>17 We use named entity recognition, noun phrase chunking and coreference resolution to identify opinion targets. [sent-31, score-0.414]
</p><p>18 Opinion targets could be other discussants or subtopics of the discussion topic. [sent-32, score-0.393]
</p><p>19 The functionality of this system is based on our previous work on attitude mining and subgroup detection in online discussions. [sent-34, score-0.95]

</p><p>29 2  System Overview  Figure 1 shows a block diagram of the system components and the processing pipeline. [sent-55, score-0.13]
</p><p>30 The first component is the thread parsing component which takes as input a discussion thread and parses it to identify posts, participants, and the reply structure of the thread. [sent-56, score-0.47]
</p><p>31 The second component in the pipeline processes the text of posts to identify polarized words and tag them with their polarity. [sent-57, score-0.273]
</p><p>32 The list of polarity words that we use in this component has been taken from the OpinionFinder system (Wilson et al. [sent-58, score-0.2]
</p><p>33 134 The polarity of a word is usually affected by the context in which it appears. [sent-60, score-0.097]
</p><p>34 For example, the word fine is positive when used as an adjective and negative when used as a noun. [sent-61, score-0.104]
</p><p>35 We require that the POS tag of a word matches the POS tag provided in  the list of polarized words that we use. [sent-64, score-0.122]
</p><p>36 The negation issue is handled in the opinion-target pairing step as we will explain later. [sent-65, score-0.068]
</p><p>37 The next step in the pipeline is to identify the candidate targets of opinion in the discussion. [sent-66, score-0.387]
</p><p>38 The target of attitude could be another discussant, an entity mentioned in the discussion, or an aspect of the discussion topic. [sent-67, score-0.83]
</p><p>39 When the target of opinion is another discussant, either the discussant name is mentioned explicitly or a second person pronoun (e. [sent-68, score-0.659]
</p><p>40 g you, your, yourself) is used to indicate that the opinion is targeting the recipient of the post. [sent-69, score-0.193]
</p><p>41 The target of opinion could also be a subtopic or an entity mentioned in the discussion. [sent-70, score-0.365]
</p><p>42 We consider as an entity any noun group that is mentioned by at least two different discussants. [sent-73, score-0.149]
</p><p>43 We only consider as entities noun groups that contain two words or more. [sent-74, score-0.08]
</p><p>44 We impose this requirement because individual nouns are very common and considering all of them as candidate targets will introduce significant noise. [sent-75, score-0.099]
</p><p>45 In addition to this shallow parsing method, we also use named entity recognition  (NER) to identify more targets. [sent-76, score-0.115]
</p><p>46 The named entity tool that we use recognizes three types of entities: person, location, and organization. [sent-77, score-0.069]
</p><p>47 We impose no restrictions on the entities identified using this method. [sent-78, score-0.064]
</p><p>48 A challenge that always arises when performing text mining tasks at this level of granularity is that entities are usually expressed by anaphorical pronouns. [sent-79, score-0.071]

[sent-84, score-0.693]
</p><p>50 Therefore, we use co-reference resolution techniques to resolve all the anaphoric links in the discussion thread. [sent-85, score-0.188]
</p><p>51 At this point, we have all the opinion words and the potential targets identified separately. [sent-86, score-0.32]
</p><p>52 The next step is to determine which opinion word is target-  ing which target. [sent-87, score-0.193]
</p><p>53 Our rules are based on the dependency relations that connect the words in a sentence. [sent-89, score-0.073]
</p><p>54 An opinion word and a target form a pair if the dependency path between them satisfies at least one of our dependency rules. [sent-90, score-0.414]
</p><p>55 The rules basically examine the types of dependency relations on the shortest path that connect the opinion word and the target in the dependency parse tree. [sent-92, score-0.454]
</p><p>56 It has been shown in previous work on relation extraction that the shortest dependency path between any two entities captures the information required to assert a relationship between them (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005). [sent-93, score-0.157]
</p><p>57 If a sentence S in a post written by participant Pi contains an opinion word OPj and a target TRk, and if the opinion-target pair satisfies one of our dependency rules, we say that Pi expresses an attitude towards TRk. [sent-94, score-1.08]
</p><p>58 The polarity of the attitude is determined by the polarity of OPj. [sent-95, score-0.762]
</p><p>59 Negation is handled in this step by reversing the polarity if the polarized expression is part of a  →+  135 neg dependency relation. [sent-97, score-0.271]
</p><p>60 It is likely that the same participant Pi expresses sentiment towards the same target TRk multiple times in different sentences in different posts. [sent-98, score-0.327]
</p><p>61 We keep track of the counts of all the instances of positive/negative attitude Pi expresses toward TRk. [sent-99, score-0.663]
</p><p>62 We represent this as Pi TRk where m (n) is the number of times Pi expressed positive (negative) attitude toward TRk. [sent-100, score-0.711]
</p><p>63 We propose a representation of discussants ´attitudes towards the identified targets in the discussion thread. [sent-102, score-0.486]
</p><p>64 As stated above, a target could be another discussant or an entity mentioned in the discussion. [sent-103, score-0.535]
</p><p>65 The values correspond to the counts of positive/negative attitudes expressed by the discussant toward each of the targets. [sent-105, score-0.532]
</p><p>66 We call this vector the discussant attitude profile (DAP). [sent-106, score-0.984]
</p><p>67 Given a discussion thread with d discussants and e entity targets, each attitude profile vector has n = (d + e) ∗ 3  −m − →+  dimensions. [sent-108, score-1.093]
</p><p>68 It has to be noted that these values are not symmet-  ric since the discussions explicitly denote the source and the target of each post. [sent-110, score-0.153]
</p><p>69 At this point, we have an attitude profile (or vector) constructed for each discussant. [sent-111, score-0.621]
</p><p>70 Our goal is to use these attitude profiles to determine the subgroup membership of each discussant. [sent-112, score-0.93]
</p><p>71 We can achieve this goal by noticing that the attitude profiles of discussants who share the same opinion are more likely to be similar to each other than to the attitude profiles of discussants with opposing opinions. [sent-113, score-1.95]
</p><p>72 This sug-  gests that clustering the attitude vector space will achieve the goal and split the discussants into subgroups based on their opinion. [sent-114, score-1.016]
</p><p>73 Part-ofspeech tagging, noun group identification, named entity recognition, co-reference resolution, and dependency parsing are all computed using the Stanford Core NLP API. [sent-116, score-0.157]
</p><p>74 2 The clustering component uses the JavaML library3 which provides implementations to several clustering algorithms such as kmeans, EM, FarthestFirst, and OPTICS. [sent-117, score-0.21]
</p><p>75 All the dependencies of the system come bundled with the system in the same package. [sent-120, score-0.126]
</p><p>76 It can be used to run the whole pipeline to detect subgroups or any portion of the pipeline. [sent-128, score-0.208]
</p><p>77 For example, it can be used to tag an input text with polarity or to identify candidate targets of opinion in a given input. [sent-129, score-0.466]
</p><p>78 For example, the user can specify which clustering algorithm should be used. [sent-131, score-0.085]
</p><p>79 To facilitate using the system for research purposes, the system comes with a clustering evaluation component that uses the ClusterEvaluator package. [sent-132, score-0.251]
</p><p>80 If the input to the system contains subgroup labels, it can be run in the evaluation mode in which case the system will output the scores of several different clustering evaluation metrics such as purity, entropy, f-measure, Jaccard, and RandIndex. [sent-134, score-0.465]
</p><p>81 The system can process any discussion thread that is input to it in a specific format. [sent-136, score-0.262]
</p><p>82 It is the user responsibility to write a parser that converts an online discussion  thread to the expected format. [sent-138, score-0.264]
</p><p>83 However, the system package comes with two such parsers for two different discussion sites: www. [sent-139, score-0.153]

</p><p>90 The average clustering purity of the detected subgroups in the dataset is 0. [sent-161, score-0.282]
</p><p>91 The system significantly outperforms baseline systems based on text clustering and discussant interaction frequency. [sent-163, score-0.511]
</p><p>92 Our experiments also show that all the components in the system (such as co-reference resolution, noun phrase chunking, etc) contribute positively to the accuracy. [sent-164, score-0.107]

<p>Author: Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Pradeep Dasigi ; Mona Diab ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: The rapid and continuous growth of social networking sites has led to the emergence of many communities of communicating groups. Many of these groups discuss ideological and political topics. It is not uncommon that the participants in such discussions split into two or more subgroups. The members of each subgroup share the same opinion toward the discussion topic and are more likely to agree with members of the same subgroup and disagree with members from opposing subgroups. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach for automatically detecting discussant subgroups in online communities. We analyze the text exchanged between the participants of a discussion to identify the attitude they carry toward each other and towards the various aspects of the discussion topic. We use attitude predictions to construct an attitude vector for each discussant. We use clustering techniques to cluster these vectors and, hence, determine the subgroup membership of each participant. We compare our methods to text clustering and other baselines, and show that our method achieves promising results.</p><p>3 0.61332345 <a title="188-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Genre_Independent_Subgroup_Detection_in_Online_Discussion_Threads%3A_A_Study_of_Implicit_Attitude_using_Textual_Latent_Semantics.html">102 acl-2012-Genre Independent Subgroup Detection in Online Discussion Threads: A Study of Implicit Attitude using Textual Latent Semantics</a></p>
<p>Author: Pradeep Dasigi ; Weiwei Guo ; Mona Diab</p><p>Abstract: We describe an unsupervised approach to the problem of automatically detecting subgroups of people holding similar opinions in a discussion thread. An intuitive way of identifying this is to detect the attitudes of discussants towards each other or named entities or topics mentioned in the discussion. Sentiment tags play an important role in this detection, but we also note another dimension to the detection of people’s attitudes in a discussion: if two persons share the same opinion, they tend to use similar language content. We consider the latter to be an implicit attitude. In this paper, we investigate the impact of implicit and explicit attitude in two genres of social media discussion data, more formal wikipedia discussions and a debate discussion forum that is much more informal. Experimental results strongly suggest that implicit attitude is an important complement for explicit attitudes (expressed via sentiment) and it can improve the sub-group detection performance independent of genre.</p><p>4 0.1240788 <a title="188-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Polarity_Consistency_Checking_for_Sentiment_Dictionaries.html">161 acl-2012-Polarity Consistency Checking for Sentiment Dictionaries</a></p>
<p>Author: Eduard Dragut ; Hong Wang ; Clement Yu ; Prasad Sistla ; Weiyi Meng</p><p>Abstract: Polarity classification of words is important for applications such as Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis. A number of sentiment word/sense dictionaries have been manually or (semi)automatically constructed. The dictionaries have substantial inaccuracies. Besides obvious instances, where the same word appears with different polarities in different dictionaries, the dictionaries exhibit complex cases, which cannot be detected by mere manual inspection. We introduce the concept of polarity consistency of words/senses in sentiment dictionaries in this paper. We show that the consistency problem is NP-complete. We reduce the polarity consistency problem to the satisfiability problem and utilize a fast SAT solver to detect inconsistencies in a sentiment dictionary. We perform experiments on four sentiment dictionaries and WordNet.</p><p>5 0.10910645 <a title="188-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Social_Event_Radar%3A_A_Bilingual_Context_Mining_and_Sentiment_Analysis_Summarization_System.html">180 acl-2012-Social Event Radar: A Bilingual Context Mining and Sentiment Analysis Summarization System</a></p>

With the rapid development of social network, people can now easily publish their opinions on the Internet. On the other hand, people can also obtain various opinions from others in a few seconds even though they do not know each other. A typical approach to obtain required information is to use a search engine with some relevant keywords. We thus take the social media and forum as our major data source and aim at collecting specific issues efficiently and effectively in this work. 163 Chen-Ming Wu Institute for Information Industry cmwu@ i i i .org .tw Seng-cho T.

<p>Author: Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Pradeep Dasigi ; Mona Diab ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: The rapid and continuous growth of social networking sites has led to the emergence of many communities of communicating groups. Many of these groups discuss ideological and political topics. It is not uncommon that the participants in such discussions split into two or more subgroups. The members of each subgroup share the same opinion toward the discussion topic and are more likely to agree with members of the same subgroup and disagree with members from opposing subgroups. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach for automatically detecting discussant subgroups in online communities. We analyze the text exchanged between the participants of a discussion to identify the attitude they carry toward each other and towards the various aspects of the discussion topic. We use attitude predictions to construct an attitude vector for each discussant. We use clustering techniques to cluster these vectors and, hence, determine the subgroup membership of each participant.

<p>Author: Pradeep Dasigi ; Weiwei Guo ; Mona Diab</p><p>Abstract: We describe an unsupervised approach to the problem of automatically detecting subgroups of people holding similar opinions in a discussion thread. An intuitive way of identifying this is to detect the attitudes of discussants towards each other or named entities or topics mentioned in the discussion. Sentiment tags play an important role in this detection, but we also note another dimension to the detection of people’s attitudes in a discussion: if two persons share the same opinion, they tend to use similar language content. We consider the latter to be an implicit attitude. In this paper, we investigate the impact of implicit and explicit attitude in two genres of social media discussion data, more formal wikipedia discussions and a debate discussion forum that is much more informal. Experimental results strongly suggest that implicit attitude is an important complement for explicit attitudes (expressed via sentiment) and it can improve the sub-group detection performance independent of genre.</p><p>4 0.32100677 <a title="188-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-Polarity_Consistency_Checking_for_Sentiment_Dictionaries.html">161 acl-2012-Polarity Consistency Checking for Sentiment Dictionaries</a></p>
<p>Author: Eduard Dragut ; Hong Wang ; Clement Yu ; Prasad Sistla ; Weiyi Meng</p><p>Abstract: Polarity classification of words is important for applications such as Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis. A number of sentiment word/sense dictionaries have been manually or (semi)automatically constructed. The dictionaries have substantial inaccuracies. Besides obvious instances, where the same word appears with different polarities in different dictionaries, the dictionaries exhibit complex cases, which cannot be detected by mere manual inspection. We introduce the concept of polarity consistency of words/senses in sentiment dictionaries in this paper. We show that the consistency problem is NP-complete. We reduce the polarity consistency problem to the satisfiability problem and utilize a fast SAT solver to detect inconsistencies in a sentiment dictionary. We perform experiments on four sentiment dictionaries and WordNet.</p><p>5 0.26954705 <a title="188-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-Social_Event_Radar%3A_A_Bilingual_Context_Mining_and_Sentiment_Analysis_Summarization_System.html">180 acl-2012-Social Event Radar: A Bilingual Context Mining and Sentiment Analysis Summarization System</a></p>
<p>Author: Wen-Tai Hsieh ; Chen-Ming Wu ; Tsun Ku ; Seng-cho T. Chou</p><p>Abstract: Social Event Radar is a new social networking-based service platform, that aim to alert as well as monitor any merchandise flaws, food-safety related issues, unexpected eruption of diseases or campaign issues towards to the Government, enterprises of any kind or election parties, through keyword expansion detection module, using bilingual sentiment opinion analysis tool kit to conclude the specific event social dashboard and deliver the outcome helping authorities to plan “risk control” strategy. With the rapid development of social network, people can now easily publish their opinions on the Internet. On the other hand, people can also obtain various opinions from others in a few seconds even though they do not know each other. A typical approach to obtain required information is to use a search engine with some relevant keywords. We thus take the social media and forum as our major data source and aim at collecting specific issues efficiently and effectively in this work. 163 Chen-Ming Wu Institute for Information Industry cmwu@ i i i .org .tw Seng-cho T.

<p>Author: Oleksandr Kolomiyets ; Steven Bethard ; Marie-Francine Moens</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach to characterizing the timeline of a text: temporal dependency structures, where all the events of a narrative are linked via partial ordering relations like BEFORE, AFTER, OVERLAP and IDENTITY. We annotate a corpus of children’s stories with temporal dependency trees, achieving agreement (Krippendorff’s Alpha) of 0.856 on the event words, 0.822 on the links between events, and of 0.700 on the ordering relation labels. We compare two parsing models for temporal dependency structures, and show that a deterministic non-projective dependency parser outperforms a graph-based maximum spanning tree parser, achieving labeled attachment accuracy of 0.647 and labeled tree edit distance of 0.596. Our analysis of the dependency parser errors gives some insights into future research directions.</p><p>3 0.77594113 <a title="188-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Concept-to-text_Generation_via_Discriminative_Reranking.html">57 acl-2012-Concept-to-text Generation via Discriminative Reranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Ioannis Konstas ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven method for concept-to-text generation, the task of automatically producing textual output from non-linguistic input. A key insight in our approach is to reduce the tasks of content selection (“what to say”) and surface realization (“how to say”) into a common parsing problem. We define a probabilistic context-free grammar that describes the structure of the input (a corpus of database records and text describing some of them) and represent it compactly as a weighted hypergraph. The hypergraph structure encodes exponentially many derivations, which we rerank discriminatively using local and global features. We propose a novel decoding algorithm for finding the best scoring derivation and generating in this setting. Experimental evaluation on the ATIS domain shows that our model outperforms a competitive discriminative system both using BLEU and in a judgment elicitation study.</p><p>4 0.7700029 <a title="188-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-A_Graph-based_Cross-lingual_Projection_Approach_for_Weakly_Supervised_Relation_Extraction.html">12 acl-2012-A Graph-based Cross-lingual Projection Approach for Weakly Supervised Relation Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Seokhwan Kim ; Gary Geunbae Lee</p><p>Abstract: Although researchers have conducted extensive studies on relation extraction in the last decade, supervised approaches are still limited because they require large amounts of training data to achieve high performances. To build a relation extractor without significant annotation effort, we can exploit cross-lingual annotation projection, which leverages parallel corpora as external resources for supervision. This paper proposes a novel graph-based projection approach and demonstrates the merits of it by using a Korean relation extraction system based on projected dataset from an English-Korean parallel corpus.</p><p>5 0.6306988 <a title="188-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Subgroup_Detection_in_Ideological_Discussions.html">187 acl-2012-Subgroup Detection in Ideological Discussions</a></p>

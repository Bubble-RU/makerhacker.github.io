<p>Author: Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Pradeep Dasigi ; Mona Diab ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: The rapid and continuous growth of social networking sites has led to the emergence of many communities of communicating groups. Many of these groups discuss ideological and political topics. It is not uncommon that the participants in such discussions split into two or more subgroups. The members of each subgroup share the same opinion toward the discussion topic and are more likely to agree with members of the same subgroup and disagree with members from opposing subgroups. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach for automatically detecting discussant subgroups in online communities. We analyze the text exchanged between the participants of a discussion to identify the attitude they carry toward each other and towards the various aspects of the discussion topic. We use attitude predictions to construct an attitude vector for each discussant. We use clustering techniques to cluster these vectors and, hence, determine the subgroup membership of each participant. We compare our methods to text clustering and other baselines, and show that our method achieves promising results.</p><p>3 0.69474274 <a title="188-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Genre_Independent_Subgroup_Detection_in_Online_Discussion_Threads%3A_A_Study_of_Implicit_Attitude_using_Textual_Latent_Semantics.html">102 acl-2012-Genre Independent Subgroup Detection in Online Discussion Threads: A Study of Implicit Attitude using Textual Latent Semantics</a></p>
<p>Author: Pradeep Dasigi ; Weiwei Guo ; Mona Diab</p><p>Abstract: We describe an unsupervised approach to the problem of automatically detecting subgroups of people holding similar opinions in a discussion thread. An intuitive way of identifying this is to detect the attitudes of discussants towards each other or named entities or topics mentioned in the discussion. Sentiment tags play an important role in this detection, but we also note another dimension to the detection of people’s attitudes in a discussion: if two persons share the same opinion, they tend to use similar language content. We consider the latter to be an implicit attitude. In this paper, we investigate the impact of implicit and explicit attitude in two genres of social media discussion data, more formal wikipedia discussions and a debate discussion forum that is much more informal. Experimental results strongly suggest that implicit attitude is an important complement for explicit attitudes (expressed via sentiment) and it can improve the sub-group detection performance independent of genre.</p><p>4 0.16711782 <a title="188-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Polarity_Consistency_Checking_for_Sentiment_Dictionaries.html">161 acl-2012-Polarity Consistency Checking for Sentiment Dictionaries</a></p>
<p>Author: Eduard Dragut ; Hong Wang ; Clement Yu ; Prasad Sistla ; Weiyi Meng</p><p>Abstract: Polarity classification of words is important for applications such as Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis. A number of sentiment word/sense dictionaries have been manually or (semi)automatically constructed. The dictionaries have substantial inaccuracies. Besides obvious instances, where the same word appears with different polarities in different dictionaries, the dictionaries exhibit complex cases, which cannot be detected by mere manual inspection. We introduce the concept of polarity consistency of words/senses in sentiment dictionaries in this paper. We show that the consistency problem is NP-complete. We reduce the polarity consistency problem to the satisfiability problem and utilize a fast SAT solver to detect inconsistencies in a sentiment dictionary. We perform experiments on four sentiment dictionaries and WordNet.</p><p>5 0.12760751 <a title="188-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Fine_Granular_Aspect_Analysis_using_Latent_Structural_Models.html">100 acl-2012-Fine Granular Aspect Analysis using Latent Structural Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Fang ; Minlie Huang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a structural learning model forjoint sentiment classification and aspect analysis of text at various levels of granularity. Our model aims to identify highly informative sentences that are aspect-specific in online custom reviews. The primary advantages of our model are two-fold: first, it performs document-level and sentence-level sentiment polarity classification jointly; second, it is able to find informative sentences that are closely related to some respects in a review, which may be helpful for aspect-level sentiment analysis such as aspect-oriented summarization. The proposed method was evaluated with 9,000 Chinese restaurant reviews. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that our model obtains promising performance. 1</p><p>6 0.11961729 <a title="188-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Social_Event_Radar%3A_A_Bilingual_Context_Mining_and_Sentiment_Analysis_Summarization_System.html">180 acl-2012-Social Event Radar: A Bilingual Context Mining and Sentiment Analysis Summarization System</a></p>

<p>Author: Wen-Tai Hsieh ; Chen-Ming Wu ; Tsun Ku ; Seng-cho T. Chou</p><p>Abstract: Social Event Radar is a new social networking-based service platform, that aim to alert as well as monitor any merchandise flaws, food-safety related issues, unexpected eruption of diseases or campaign issues towards to the Government, enterprises of any kind or election parties, through keyword expansion detection module, using bilingual sentiment opinion analysis tool kit to conclude the specific event social dashboard and deliver the outcome helping authorities to plan “risk control” strategy. With the rapid development of social network, people can now easily publish their opinions on the Internet. On the other hand, people can also obtain various opinions from others in a few seconds even though they do not know each other. A typical approach to obtain required information is to use a search engine with some relevant keywords. We thus take the social media and forum as our major data source and aim at collecting specific issues efficiently and effectively in this work. 163 Chen-Ming Wu Institute for Information Industry cmwu@ i i i .org .tw Seng-cho T.

<p>Author: Boxing Chen ; Roland Kuhn ; Samuel Larkin</p><p>Abstract: Many machine translation (MT) evaluation metrics have been shown to correlate better with human judgment than BLEU. In principle, tuning on these metrics should yield better systems than tuning on BLEU. However, due to issues such as speed, requirements for linguistic resources, and optimization difficulty, they have not been widely adopted for tuning. This paper presents PORT , a new MT evaluation metric which combines precision, recall and an ordering metric and which is primarily designed for tuning MT systems. PORT does not require external resources and is quick to compute. It has a better correlation with human judgment than BLEU. We compare PORT-tuned MT systems to BLEU-tuned baselines in five experimental conditions involving four language pairs. PORT tuning achieves 1 consistently better performance than BLEU tuning, according to four automated metrics (including BLEU) and to human evaluation: in comparisons of outputs from 300 source sentences, human judges preferred the PORT-tuned output 45.3% of the time (vs. 32.7% BLEU tuning preferences and 22.0% ties). 1</p><p>3 0.81915838 <a title="188-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Fast_Online_Lexicon_Learning_for_Grounded_Language_Acquisition.html">93 acl-2012-Fast Online Lexicon Learning for Grounded Language Acquisition</a></p>
<p>Author: David Chen</p><p>Abstract: Learning a semantic lexicon is often an important first step in building a system that learns to interpret the meaning of natural language. It is especially important in language grounding where the training data usually consist of language paired with an ambiguous perceptual context. Recent work by Chen and Mooney (201 1) introduced a lexicon learning method that deals with ambiguous relational data by taking intersections of graphs. While the algorithm produced good lexicons for the task of learning to interpret navigation instructions, it only works in batch settings and does not scale well to large datasets. In this paper we introduce a new online algorithm that is an order of magnitude faster and surpasses the stateof-the-art results. We show that by changing the grammar of the formal meaning represen- . tation language and training on additional data collected from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk we can further improve the results. We also include experimental results on a Chinese translation of the training data to demonstrate the generality of our approach.</p><p>4 0.81024879 <a title="188-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-A_Graph-based_Cross-lingual_Projection_Approach_for_Weakly_Supervised_Relation_Extraction.html">12 acl-2012-A Graph-based Cross-lingual Projection Approach for Weakly Supervised Relation Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Seokhwan Kim ; Gary Geunbae Lee</p><p>Abstract: Although researchers have conducted extensive studies on relation extraction in the last decade, supervised approaches are still limited because they require large amounts of training data to achieve high performances. To build a relation extractor without significant annotation effort, we can exploit cross-lingual annotation projection, which leverages parallel corpora as external resources for supervision. This paper proposes a novel graph-based projection approach and demonstrates the merits of it by using a Korean relation extraction system based on projected dataset from an English-Korean parallel corpus.</p><p>5 0.71877605 <a title="188-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Subgroup_Detection_in_Ideological_Discussions.html">187 acl-2012-Subgroup Detection in Ideological Discussions</a></p>
<p>Author: Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Pradeep Dasigi ; Mona Diab ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: The rapid and continuous growth of social networking sites has led to the emergence of many communities of communicating groups. Many of these groups discuss ideological and political topics. It is not uncommon that the participants in such discussions split into two or more subgroups. The members of each subgroup share the same opinion toward the discussion topic and are more likely to agree with members of the same subgroup and disagree with members from opposing subgroups. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach for automatically detecting discussant subgroups in online communities. We analyze the text exchanged between the participants of a discussion to identify the attitude they carry toward each other and towards the various aspects of the discussion topic. We use attitude predictions to construct an attitude vector for each discussant. We use clustering techniques to cluster these vectors and, hence, determine the subgroup membership of each participant. We compare our methods to text clustering and other baselines, and show that our method achieves promising results.</p><p>6 0.68477756 <a title="188-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Corpus-based_Interpretation_of_Instructions_in_Virtual_Environments.html">59 acl-2012-Corpus-based Interpretation of Instructions in Virtual Environments</a></p>

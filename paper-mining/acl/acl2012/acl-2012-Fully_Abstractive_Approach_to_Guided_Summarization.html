<p>Author: Ziheng Lin ; Chang Liu ; Hwee Tou Ng ; Min-Yen Kan</p><p>Abstract: An ideal summarization system should produce summaries that have high content coverage and linguistic quality. Many state-ofthe-art summarization systems focus on content coverage by extracting content-dense sentences from source articles. A current research focus is to process these sentences so that they read fluently as a whole. The current AESOP task encourages research on evaluating summaries on content, readability, and overall responsiveness. In this work, we adapt a machine translation metric to measure content coverage, apply an enhanced discourse coherence model to evaluate summary readability, and combine both in a trained regression model to evaluate overall responsiveness. The results show significantly improved performance over AESOP 2011 submitted metrics.</p><p>4 0.15966421 <a title="101-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Combining_Textual_Entailment_and_Argumentation_Theory_for_Supporting_Online_Debates_Interactions.html">53 acl-2012-Combining Textual Entailment and Argumentation Theory for Supporting Online Debates Interactions</a></p>

<p>Author: Arjun Mukherjee ; Bing Liu</p><p>Abstract: Aspect extraction is a central problem in sentiment analysis. Current methods either extract aspects without categorizing them, or extract and categorize them using unsupervised topic modeling. By categorizing, we mean the synonymous aspects should be clustered into the same category. In this paper, we solve the problem in a different setting where the user provides some seed words for a few aspect categories and the model extracts and clusters aspect terms into categories simultaneously. This setting is important because categorizing aspects is a subjective task. For different application purposes, different categorizations may be needed. Some form of user guidance is desired. In this paper, we propose two statistical models to solve this seeded problem, which aim to discover exactly what the user wants. Our experimental results show that the two proposed models are indeed able to perform the task effectively. 1</p><p>6 0.10773503 <a title="101-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Classifying_French_Verbs_Using_French_and_English_Lexical_Resources.html">48 acl-2012-Classifying French Verbs Using French and English Lexical Resources</a></p>

<p>Author: Yunyao Li ; Laura Chiticariu ; Huahai Yang ; Frederick Reiss ; Arnaldo Carreno-fuentes</p><p>Abstract: Information extraction (IE) is becoming a critical building block in many enterprise applications. In order to satisfy the increasing text analytics demands of enterprise applications, it is crucial to enable developers with general computer science background to develop high quality IE extractors. In this demonstration, we present WizIE, an IE development environment intended to reduce the development life cycle and enable developers with little or no linguistic background to write high quality IE rules. WizI E provides an integrated wizard-like environment that guides IE developers step-by-step throughout the entire development process, based on best practices synthesized from the experience of expert developers. In addition, WizIE reduces the manual effort involved in performing key IE development tasks by offering automatic result explanation and rule discovery functionality. Preliminary results indicate that WizI E is a step forward towards enabling extractor development for novice IE developers.</p><p>5 0.43337193 <a title="101-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-Combining_Textual_Entailment_and_Argumentation_Theory_for_Supporting_Online_Debates_Interactions.html">53 acl-2012-Combining Textual Entailment and Argumentation Theory for Supporting Online Debates Interactions</a></p>

<p>Author: Shingo Takamatsu ; Issei Sato ; Hiroshi Nakagawa</p><p>Abstract: In relation extraction, distant supervision seeks to extract relations between entities from text by using a knowledge base, such as Freebase, as a source of supervision. When a sentence and a knowledge base refer to the same entity pair, this approach heuristically labels the sentence with the corresponding relation in the knowledge base. However, this heuristic can fail with the result that some sentences are labeled wrongly. This noisy labeled data causes poor extraction performance. In this paper, we propose a method to reduce the number of wrong labels. We present a novel generative model that directly models the heuristic labeling process of distant supervision. The model predicts whether assigned labels are correct or wrong via its hidden variables. Our experimental results show that this model detected wrong labels with higher performance than baseline methods. In the ex- periment, we also found that our wrong label reduction boosted the performance of relation extraction.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.97161436 <a title="101-lda-2" href="./acl-2012-Fully_Abstractive_Approach_to_Guided_Summarization.html">101 acl-2012-Fully Abstractive Approach to Guided Summarization</a></p>

<p>Author: Claire Gardent ; Shashi Narayan</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, error mining approaches were developed to help identify the most likely sources of parsing failures in parsing systems using handcrafted grammars and lexicons. However the techniques they use to enumerate and count n-grams builds on the sequential nature of a text corpus and do not easily extend to structured data. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for mining trees and apply it to detect the most likely sources of generation failure. We show that this tree mining algorithm permits identifying not only errors in the generation system (grammar, lexicon) but also mismatches between the structures contained in the input and the input structures expected by our generator as well as a few idiosyncrasies/error in the input data.</p><p>4 0.93157822 <a title="101-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Learning_High-Level_Planning_from_Text.html">129 acl-2012-Learning High-Level Planning from Text</a></p>
<p>Author: S.R.K. Branavan ; Nate Kushman ; Tao Lei ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: Comprehending action preconditions and effects is an essential step in modeling the dynamics of the world. In this paper, we express the semantics of precondition relations extracted from text in terms of planning operations. The challenge of modeling this connection is to ground language at the level of relations. This type of grounding enables us to create high-level plans based on language abstractions. Our model jointly learns to predict precondition relations from text and to perform high-level planning guided by those relations. We implement this idea in the reinforcement learning framework using feedback automatically obtained from plan execution attempts. When applied to a complex virtual world and text describing that world, our relation extraction technique performs on par with a supervised baseline, yielding an F-measure of 66% compared to the baseline’s 65%. Additionally, we show that a high-level planner utilizing these extracted relations significantly outperforms a strong, text unaware baseline successfully completing 80% of planning tasks as compared to 69% for the baseline.1 –</p><p>5 0.91741574 <a title="101-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Prediction_of_Learning_Curves_in_Machine_Translation.html">163 acl-2012-Prediction of Learning Curves in Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Prasanth Kolachina ; Nicola Cancedda ; Marc Dymetman ; Sriram Venkatapathy</p><p>Abstract: Parallel data in the domain of interest is the key resource when training a statistical machine translation (SMT) system for a specific purpose. Since ad-hoc manual translation can represent a significant investment in time and money, a prior assesment of the amount of training data required to achieve a satisfactory accuracy level can be very useful. In this work, we show how to predict what the learning curve would look like if we were to manually translate increasing amounts of data. We consider two scenarios, 1) Monolingual samples in the source and target languages are available and 2) An additional small amount of parallel corpus is also available. We propose methods for predicting learning curves in both these scenarios.</p><p>6 0.85645777 <a title="101-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-WizIE%3A_A_Best_Practices_Guided_Development_Environment_for_Information_Extraction.html">215 acl-2012-WizIE: A Best Practices Guided Development Environment for Information Extraction</a></p>

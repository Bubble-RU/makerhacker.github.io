More specifically, given a query image, we retrieve existing human-composed phrases used to describe visually similar images, then selectively combine those phrases to generate a novel description for the query image. We cast the generation process as constraint optimization problems, collectively incorporating multiple interconnected aspects of language composition for content planning, surface realization and discourse structure. Evaluation by human annotators indicates that our final system generates more semantically correct and linguistically appealing descriptions than two nontrivial baselines.</p><p>3 0.087786965 <a title="76-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-A_Broad-Coverage_Normalization_System_for_Social_Media_Language.html">2 acl-2012-A Broad-Coverage Normalization System for Social Media Language</a></p>
<p>Author: Fei Liu ; Fuliang Weng ; Xiao Jiang</p><p>Abstract: Social media language contains huge amount and wide variety of nonstandard tokens, created both intentionally and unintentionally by the users. It is of crucial importance to normalize the noisy nonstandard tokens before applying other NLP techniques. A major challenge facing this task is the system coverage, i.e., for any user-created nonstandard term, the system should be able to restore the correct word within its top n output candidates. In this paper, we propose a cognitivelydriven normalization system that integrates different human perspectives in normalizing the nonstandard tokens, including the enhanced letter transformation, visual priming, and string/phonetic similarity. The system was evaluated on both word- and messagelevel using four SMS and Twitter data sets. Results show that our system achieves over 90% word-coverage across all data sets (a . 10% absolute increase compared to state-ofthe-art); the broad word-coverage can also successfully translate into message-level performance gain, yielding 6% absolute increase compared to the best prior approach.</p><p>4 0.082243405 <a title="76-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Corpus-based_Interpretation_of_Instructions_in_Virtual_Environments.html">59 acl-2012-Corpus-based Interpretation of Instructions in Virtual Environments</a></p>
<p>Author: Luciana Benotti ; Martin Villalba ; Tessa Lau ; Julian Cerruti</p><p>Abstract: Previous approaches to instruction interpretation have required either extensive domain adaptation or manually annotated corpora. This paper presents a novel approach to instruction interpretation that leverages a large amount of unannotated, easy-to-collect data from humans interacting with a virtual world. We compare several algorithms for automatically segmenting and discretizing this data into (utterance, reaction) pairs and training a classifier to predict reactions given the next utterance. Our empirical analysis shows that the best algorithm achieves 70% accuracy on this task, with no manual annotation required. 1 Introduction and motivation Mapping instructions into automatically executable actions would enable the creation of natural lan- , guage interfaces to many applications (Lau et al., 2009; Branavan et al., 2009; Orkin and Roy, 2009). In this paper, we focus on the task of navigation and manipulation of a virtual environment (Vogel and Jurafsky, 2010; Chen and Mooney, 2011). Current symbolic approaches to the problem are brittle to the natural language variation present in instructions and require intensive rule authoring to be fit for a new task (Dzikovska et al., 2008). Current statistical approaches require extensive manual annotations of the corpora used for training (MacMahon et al., 2006; Matuszek et al., 2010; Gorniak and Roy, 2007; Rieser and Lemon, 2010). Manual annotation and rule authoring by natural language engineering experts are bottlenecks for developing conversational systems for new domains. 181 t e s s al au @ us . ibm . com, j ce rrut i ar .ibm . com @ This paper proposes a fully automated approach to interpreting natural language instructions to complete a task in a virtual world based on unsupervised recordings of human-human interactions perform- ing that task in that virtual world. Given unannotated corpora collected from humans following other humans’ instructions, our system automatically segments the corpus into labeled training data for a classification algorithm. Our interpretation algorithm is based on the observation that similar instructions uttered in similar contexts should lead to similar actions being taken in the virtual world. Given a previously unseen instruction, our system outputs actions that can be directly executed in the virtual world, based on what humans did when given similar instructions in the past. 2 Corpora situated in virtual worlds Our environment consists of six virtual worlds designed for the natural language generation shared task known as the GIVE Challenge (Koller et al., 2010), where a pair of partners must collaborate to solve a task in a 3D space (Figure 1). The “instruction follower” (IF) can move around in the virtual world, but has no knowledge of the task. The “instruction giver” (IG) types instructions to the IF in order to guide him to accomplish the task. Each corpus contains the IF’s actions and position recorded every 200 milliseconds, as well as the IG’s instruc- tions with their timestamps. We used two corpora for our experiments. The Cm corpus (Gargett et al., 2010) contains instructions given by multiple people, consisting of 37 games spanning 2163 instructions over 8: 17 hs.

The world consists of interconnecting hallways, rooms and objects Cs corpus (Benotti and Denis, 2011), gathered using a single IG, is composed of 63 games and 3417 in- structions, and was recorded in a span of 6:09 hs. It took less than 15 hours to collect the corpora through the web and the subjects reported that the experiment was fun. While the environment is restricted, people describe the same route and the same objects in extremely different ways. Below are some examples of instructions from our corpus all given for the same route shown in Figure 1. 1) out 2) walk down the passage 3) nowgo [sic] to the pink room 4) back to the room with the plant 5) Go through the door on the left 6) go through opening with yellow wall paper People describe routes using landmarks (4) or specific actions (2). They may describe the same object differently (5 vs 6). Instructions also differ in their scope (3 vs 1). Thus, even ignoring spelling and grammatical errors, navigation instructions contain considerable variation which makes interpreting them a challenging problem. 3 Learning from previous interpretations Our algorithm consists of two phases: annotation and interpretation. Annotation is performed only once and consists of automatically associating each IG instruction to an IF reaction. Interpretation is performed every time the system receives an instruc182 tion and consists of predicting an appropriate reaction given reactions observed in the corpus. Our method is based on the assumption that a reaction captures the semantics of the instruction that caused it. Therefore, if two utterances result in the same reaction, they are paraphrases of each other, and similar utterances should generate the same reaction. This approach enables us to predict reactions for previously-unseen instructions. 3.1 Annotation phase The key challenge in learning from massive amounts of easily-collected data is to automatically annotate an unannotated corpus. Our annotation method consists of two parts: first, segmenting a low-level interaction trace into utterances and corresponding reactions, and second, discretizing those reactions into canonical action sequences. Segmentation enables our algorithm to learn from traces of IFs interacting directly with a virtual world. Since the IF can move freely in the virtual world, his actions are a stream of continuous behavior. Segmentation divides these traces into reactions that follow from each utterance of the IG. Consider the following example starting at the situation shown in Figure 1: IG(1): go through the yellow opening IF(2): [walks out of the room] IF(3): [turns left at the intersection] IF(4): [enters the room with the sofa] IG(5): stop It is not clear whether the IF is doing h3, 4i because h neo tis c reacting htoe r1 t or Fbec isadu soei hge h 3is, being proactive. While one could manually annotate this data to remove extraneous actions, our goal is to develop automated solutions that enable learning from massive amounts of data. We decided to approach this problem by experimenting with two alternative formal definitions: 1) a strict definition that considers the maximum reaction according to the IF behavior, and 2) a loose defini- tion based on the empirical observation that, in situated interaction, most instructions are constrained by the current visually perceived affordances (Gibson, 1979; Stoia et al., 2006). We formally define behavior segmentation (Bhv) as follows. A reaction rk to an instruction uk begins right after the instruction uk is uttered and ends right before the next instruction uk+1 is uttered. In the example, instruction 1corresponds to h2, 3, 4i . We formally d inefsitnrue visibility segmentation (Vis) as f Wolelows. A reaction rk to an instruction uk begins right after the instruction uk is uttered and ends right before the next instruction uk+1 is uttered or right after the IF leaves the area visible at 360◦ from where uk was uttered. In the example, instruction 1’s reaction would be limited to h2i because the intersection is nwootu vldisi bbele l ifmroimte dw htoer he2 tihe b eicnasutrsuec ttihoen was suetctetiroend. The Bhv and Vis methods define how to segment an interaction trace into utterances and their corresponding reactions. However, users frequently perform noisy behavior that is irrelevant to the goal of the task. For example, after hearing an instruction, an IF might go into the wrong room, realize the error, and leave the room. A reaction should not in- clude such irrelevant actions. In addition, IFs may accomplish the same goal using different behaviors: two different IFs may interpret “go to the pink room” by following different paths to the same destination. We would like to be able to generalize both reactions into one canonical reaction. As a result, our approach discretizes reactions into higher-level action sequences with less noise and less variation. Our discretization algorithm uses an automated planner and a planning representation of the task. This planning representation includes: (1) the task goal, (2) the actions which can be taken in the virtual world, and (3) the current state of the virtual world. Using the planning representation, the planner calculates an optimal path between the starting and ending states of the reaction, eliminating all unnecessary actions. While we use the classical planner FF (Hoffmann, 2003), our technique could also work with classical planning (Nau et al., 2004) or other techniques such as probabilistic planning (Bonet and Geffner, 2005). It is also not dependent on a particular discretization of the world in terms of actions. Now we are ready to define canonical reaction ck formally. Let Sk be the state of the virtual world when instruction uk was uttered, Sk+1 be the state of the world where the reaction ends (as defined by Bhv or Vis segmentation), and D be the planning domain representation of the virtual world. The canonical reaction to uk is defined as the sequence of actions 183 returned by the planner with Sk as initial state, Sk+1 as goal state and D as planning domain. 3.2 Interpretation phase The annotation phase results in a collection of (uk, ck) pairs. The interpretation phase uses these pairs to interpret new utterances in three steps. First, we filter the set of pairs into those whose reactions can be directly executed from the current IF position. Second, we group the filtered pairs according to their reactions. Third, we select the group with utterances most similar to the new utterance, and output that group’s reaction. Figure 2 shows the output of the first two steps: three groups of pairs whose reactions can all be executed from the IF’s current position. Figure 2: Utterance groups for this situation. Colored arrows show the reaction associated with each group. We treat the third step, selecting the most similar group for a new utterance, as a classification problem. We compare three different classification methods. One method uses nearest-neighbor classification with three different similarity metrics: Jaccard and Overlap coefficients (both of which measure the degree of overlap between two sets, differing only in the normalization of the final value (Nikravesh et al., 2005)), and Levenshtein Distance (a string met- ric for measuring the amount of differences between two sequences of words (Levenshtein, 1966)). Our second classification method employs a strategy in which we considered each group as a set of possible machine translations of our utterance, using the BLEU measure (Papineni et al., 2002) to select which group could be considered the best translation of our utterance. Finally, we trained an SVM classifier (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) using the unigrams Corpus Cm Corpus Cs Algorithm Bhv Vis Bhv Vis Jaccard47%54%54%70% Overlap BLEU SVM Levenshtein 43% 44% 33% 21% 53% 52% 29% 20% 45% 54% 45% 8% 60% 50% 29% 17% Table 1: Accuracy comparison between Cm and Cs for Bhv and Vis segmentation of each paraphrase and the position of the IF as features, and setting their group as the output class using a libSVM wrapper (Chang and Lin, 2011). When the system misinterprets an instruction we use a similar approach to what people do in order to overcome misunderstandings. If the system executes an incorrect reaction, the IG can tell the system to cancel its current interpretation and try again using a paraphrase, selecting a different reaction. 4 Evaluation For the evaluation phase, we annotated both the Cm and Cs corpora entirely, and then we split them in an 80/20 proportion; the first 80% of data collected in each virtual world was used for training, while the remaining 20% was used for testing. For each pair (uk, ck) in the testing set, we used our algorithm to predict the reaction to the selected utterance, and then compared this result against the automatically annotated reaction. Table 1 shows the results. Comparing the Bhv and Vis segmentation strategies, Vis tends to obtain better results than Bhv. In addition, accuracy on the Cs corpus was generally higher than Cm. Given that Cs contained only one IG, we believe this led to less variability in the instructions and less noise in the training data. We evaluated the impact of user corrections by simulating them using the existing corpus. In case of a wrong response, the algorithm receives a second utterance with the same reaction (a paraphrase of the previous one). Then the new utterance is tested over the same set of possible groups, except for the one which was returned before. If the correct reaction is not predicted after four tries, or there are no utterances with the same reaction, the predictions are registered as wrong. To measure the effects of user corrections vs. without, we used a different evalu184 ation process for this algorithm: first, we split the corpus in a 50/50 proportion, and then we moved correctly predicted utterances from the testing set towards training, until either there was nothing more to learn or the training set reached 80% of the entire corpus size. As expected, user corrections significantly improve accuracy, as shown in Figure 3. The worst algorithm’s results improve linearly with each try, while the best ones behave asymptotically, barely improving after the second try. The best algorithm reaches 92% with just one correction from the IG. 5 Discussion and future work We presented an approach to instruction interpretation which learns from non-annotated logs of human behavior. Our empirical analysis shows that our best algorithm achieves 70% accuracy on this task, with no manual annotation required. When corrections are added, accuracy goes up to 92% for just one correction. We consider our results promising since state of the art semi-unsupervised approaches to instruction interpretation (Chen and Mooney, 2011) reports a 55% accuracy on manually segmented data. We plan to compare our system’s performance against human performance in comparable situations. Our informal observations of the GIVE corpus indicate that humans often follow instructions incorrectly, so our automated system’s performance may be on par with human performance. Although we have presented our approach in the context of 3D virtual worlds, we believe our technique is also applicable to other domains such as the web, video games, or Human Robot Interaction.

<p>Author: Eric Huang ; Richard Socher ; Christopher Manning ; Andrew Ng</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised word representations are very useful in NLP tasks both as inputs to learning algorithms and as extra word features in NLP systems. However, most of these models are built with only local context and one representation per word. This is problematic because words are often polysemous and global context can also provide useful information for learning word meanings. We present a new neural network architecture which 1) learns word embeddings that better capture the semantics of words by incorporating both local and global document context, and 2) accounts for homonymy and polysemy by learning multiple embeddings per word. We introduce a new dataset with human judgments on pairs of words in sentential context, and evaluate our model on it, showing that our model outperforms competitive baselines and other neural language models. 1</p><p>6 0.070869021 <a title="76-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-How_Are_Spelling_Errors_Generated_and_Corrected%3F_A_Study_of_Corrected_and_Uncorrected_Spelling_Errors_Using_Keystroke_Logs.html">111 acl-2012-How Are Spelling Errors Generated and Corrected?

<p>Author: Elia Bruni ; Gemma Boleda ; Marco Baroni ; Nam Khanh Tran</p><p>Abstract: Our research aims at building computational models of word meaning that are perceptually grounded. Using computer vision techniques, we build visual and multimodal distributional models and compare them to standard textual models. Our results show that, while visual models with state-of-the-art computer vision techniques perform worse than textual models in general tasks (accounting for semantic relatedness), they are as good or better models of the meaning of words with visual correlates such as color terms, even in a nontrivial task that involves nonliteral uses of such words. Moreover, we show that visual and textual information are tapping on different aspects of meaning, and indeed combining them in multimodal models often improves performance.</p><p>2 0.88071448 <a title="76-lsi-2" href="./acl-2012-Collective_Generation_of_Natural_Image_Descriptions.html">51 acl-2012-Collective Generation of Natural Image Descriptions</a></p>
<p>Author: Polina Kuznetsova ; Vicente Ordonez ; Alexander Berg ; Tamara Berg ; Yejin Choi</p><p>Abstract: We present a holistic data-driven approach to image description generation, exploiting the vast amount of (noisy) parallel image data and associated natural language descriptions available on the web. More specifically, given a query image, we retrieve existing human-composed phrases used to describe visually similar images, then selectively combine those phrases to generate a novel description for the query image. We cast the generation process as constraint optimization problems, collectively incorporating multiple interconnected aspects of language composition for content planning, surface realization and discourse structure. Evaluation by human annotators indicates that our final system generates more semantically correct and linguistically appealing descriptions than two nontrivial baselines.</p><p>3 0.56406528 <a title="76-lsi-3" href="./acl-2012-How_Are_Spelling_Errors_Generated_and_Corrected%3F_A_Study_of_Corrected_and_Uncorrected_Spelling_Errors_Using_Keystroke_Logs.html">111 acl-2012-How Are Spelling Errors Generated and Corrected? A Study of Corrected and Uncorrected Spelling Errors Using Keystroke Logs</a></p>
<p>Author: Yukino Baba ; Hisami Suzuki</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of spelling errors that are corrected as you type, vs. those that remain uncorrected. First, we generate naturally occurring online error correction data by logging users’ keystrokes, and by automatically deriving pre- and postcorrection strings from them. We then perform an analysis of this data against the errors that remain in the final text as well as across languages. Our analysis shows a clear distinction between the types of errors that are generated and those that remain uncorrected, as well as across languages.</p><p>4 0.41038552 <a title="76-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-A_Broad-Coverage_Normalization_System_for_Social_Media_Language.html">2 acl-2012-A Broad-Coverage Normalization System for Social Media Language</a></p>
<p>Author: Fei Liu ; Fuliang Weng ; Xiao Jiang</p><p>Abstract: Social media language contains huge amount and wide variety of nonstandard tokens, created both intentionally and unintentionally by the users. It is of crucial importance to normalize the noisy nonstandard tokens before applying other NLP techniques. A major challenge facing this task is the system coverage, i.e., for any user-created nonstandard term, the system should be able to restore the correct word within its top n output candidates. In this paper, we propose a cognitivelydriven normalization system that integrates different human perspectives in normalizing the nonstandard tokens, including the enhanced letter transformation, visual priming, and string/phonetic similarity. The system was evaluated on both word- and messagelevel using four SMS and Twitter data sets. Results show that our system achieves over 90% word-coverage across all data sets (a . 10% absolute increase compared to state-ofthe-art); the broad word-coverage can also successfully translate into message-level performance gain, yielding 6% absolute increase compared to the best prior approach.</p><p>5 0.40368003 <a title="76-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-Humor_as_Circuits_in_Semantic_Networks.html">112 acl-2012-Humor as Circuits in Semantic Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Igor Labutov ; Hod Lipson</p><p>Abstract: This work presents a first step to a general implementation of the Semantic-Script Theory of Humor (SSTH). Of the scarce amount of research in computational humor, no research had focused on humor generation beyond simple puns and punning riddles. We propose an algorithm for mining simple humorous scripts from a semantic network (ConceptNet) by specifically searching for dual scripts that jointly maximize overlap and incongruity metrics in line with Raskin’s Semantic-Script Theory of Humor. Initial results show that a more relaxed constraint of this form is capable of generating humor of deeper semantic content than wordplay riddles. We evaluate the said metrics through a user-assessed quality of the generated two-liners.</p><p>6 0.39657849 <a title="76-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-Qualitative_Modeling_of_Spatial_Prepositions_and_Motion_Expressions.html">166 acl-2012-Qualitative Modeling of Spatial Prepositions and Motion Expressions</a></p>

<p>Author: Fan Bu ; Hang Li ; Xiaoyan Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Learning for sentence re-writing is a fundamental task in natural language processing and information retrieval. In this paper, we propose a new class of kernel functions, referred to as string re-writing kernel, to address the problem. A string re-writing kernel measures the similarity between two pairs of strings, each pair representing re-writing of a string. It can capture the lexical and structural similarity between two pairs of sentences without the need of constructing syntactic trees. We further propose an instance of string rewriting kernel which can be computed efficiently. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our method can achieve better results than state-of-the-art methods on two sentence re-writing learning tasks: paraphrase identification and recognizing textual entailment.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.71185702 <a title="76-lda-2" href="./acl-2012-Distributional_Semantics_in_Technicolor.html">76 acl-2012-Distributional Semantics in Technicolor</a></p>

<p>Author: Hong Sun ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: SMT has been used in paraphrase generation by translating a source sentence into another (pivot) language and then back into the source. The resulting sentences can be used as candidate paraphrases ofthe source sentence. Existing work that uses two independently trained SMT systems cannot directly optimize the paraphrase results. Paraphrase criteria especially the paraphrase rate is not able to be ensured in that way. In this paper, we propose a joint learning method of two SMT systems to optimize the process of paraphrase generation. In addition, a revised BLEU score (called iBLEU) which measures the adequacy and diversity of the generated paraphrase sentence is proposed for tuning parameters in SMT systems. Our experiments on NIST 2008 testing data with automatic evaluation as well as human judgments suggest that the proposed method is able to enhance the paraphrase quality by adjusting between semantic equivalency and surface dissimilarity.</p><p>4 0.51357144 <a title="76-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Collective_Generation_of_Natural_Image_Descriptions.html">51 acl-2012-Collective Generation of Natural Image Descriptions</a></p>

<p>Author: Ivan Titov ; Alexandre Klementiev</p><p>Abstract: We argue that multilingual parallel data provides a valuable source of indirect supervision for induction of shallow semantic representations. Specifically, we consider unsupervised induction of semantic roles from sentences annotated with automatically-predicted syntactic dependency representations and use a stateof-the-art generative Bayesian non-parametric model. At inference time, instead of only seeking the model which explains the monolingual data available for each language, we regularize the objective by introducing a soft constraint penalizing for disagreement in argument labeling on aligned sentences. We propose a simple approximate learning algorithm for our set-up which results in efficient inference. When applied to German-English parallel data, our method obtains a substantial improvement over a model trained without using the agreement signal, when both are tested on non-parallel sentences.</p><p>6 0.51297921 <a title="76-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-The_Creation_of_a_Corpus_of_English_Metalanguage.html">195 acl-2012-The Creation of a Corpus of English Metalanguage</a></p>

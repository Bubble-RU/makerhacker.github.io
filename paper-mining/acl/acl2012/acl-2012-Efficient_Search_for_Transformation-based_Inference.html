<p>Author: Asher Stern ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces BIUTEE1 , an opensource system for recognizing textual entailment. Its main advantages are its ability to utilize various types of knowledge resources, and its extensibility by which new knowledge resources and inference components can be easily integrated. These abilities make BIUTEE an appealing RTE system for two research communities: (1) researchers of end applications, that can benefit from generic textual inference, and (2) RTE researchers, who can integrate their novel algorithms and knowledge resources into our system, saving the time and effort of developing a complete RTE system from scratch. Notable assistance for these re- searchers is provided by a visual tracing tool, by which researchers can refine and “debug” their knowledge resources and inference components.</p><p>3 0.16521339 <a title="78-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Crowdsourcing_Inference-Rule_Evaluation.html">65 acl-2012-Crowdsourcing Inference-Rule Evaluation</a></p>
<p>Author: Naomi Zeichner ; Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: The importance of inference rules to semantic applications has long been recognized and extensive work has been carried out to automatically acquire inference-rule resources. However, evaluating such resources has turned out to be a non-trivial task, slowing progress in the field. In this paper, we suggest a framework for evaluating inference-rule resources. Our framework simplifies a previously proposed “instance-based evaluation” method that involved substantial annotator training, making it suitable for crowdsourcing. We show that our method produces a large amount of annotations with high inter-annotator agreement for a low cost at a short period of time, without requiring training expert annotators.</p><p>4 0.16331214 <a title="78-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Spectral_Learning_of_Latent-Variable_PCFGs.html">181 acl-2012-Spectral Learning of Latent-Variable PCFGs</a></p>

<p>Author: Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan ; Meni Adler ; Jacob Goldberger</p><p>Abstract: Learning entailment rules is fundamental in many semantic-inference applications and has been an active field of research in recent years. In this paper we address the problem of learning transitive graphs that describe entailment rules between predicates (termed entailment graphs). We first identify that entailment graphs exhibit a “tree-like” property and are very similar to a novel type of graph termed forest-reducible graph. We utilize this property to develop an iterative efficient approximation algorithm for learning the graph edges, where each iteration takes linear time. We compare our approximation algorithm to a recently-proposed state-of-the-art exact algorithm and show that it is more efficient and scalable both theoretically and empirically, while its output quality is close to that given by the optimal solution of the exact algorithm.</p><p>6 0.11951315 <a title="78-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Entailment-based_Text_Exploration_with_Application_to_the_Health-care_Domain.html">82 acl-2012-Entailment-based Text Exploration with Application to the Health-care Domain</a></p>

<p>Author: Shomir Wilson</p><p>Abstract: Metalanguage is an essential linguistic mechanism which allows us to communicate explicit information about language itself. However, it has been underexamined in research in language technologies, to the detriment of the performance of systems that could exploit it. This paper describes the creation of the first tagged and delineated corpus of English metalanguage, accompanied by an explicit definition and a rubric for identifying the phenomenon in text. This resource will provide a basis for further studies of metalanguage and enable its utilization in language technologies.</p><p>4 0.60760307 <a title="78-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Using_Rejuvenation_to_Improve_Particle_Filtering_for_Bayesian_Word_Segmentation.html">211 acl-2012-Using Rejuvenation to Improve Particle Filtering for Bayesian Word Segmentation</a></p>

<p>Author: Kuzman Ganchev ; Keith Hall ; Ryan McDonald ; Slav Petrov</p><p>Abstract: Syntactic analysis of search queries is important for a variety of information-retrieval tasks; however, the lack of annotated data makes training query analysis models difficult. We propose a simple, efficient procedure in which part-of-speech tags are transferred from retrieval-result snippets to queries at training time. Unlike previous work, our final model does not require any additional resources at run-time. Compared to a state-ofthe-art approach, we achieve more than 20% relative error reduction. Additionally, we annotate a corpus of search queries with partof-speech tags, providing a resource for future work on syntactic query analysis.</p><p>6 0.60510308 <a title="78-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-A_Probabilistic_Model_for_Canonicalizing_Named_Entity_Mentions.html">18 acl-2012-A Probabilistic Model for Canonicalizing Named Entity Mentions</a></p>

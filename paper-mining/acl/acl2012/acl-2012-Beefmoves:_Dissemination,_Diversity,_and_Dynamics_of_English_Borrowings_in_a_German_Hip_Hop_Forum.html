[sent-2, score-0.916]
</p><p>2 1 Introduction Because English has established itself as something of a global lingua franca, many languages are currently undergoing a process ofintroducing new loanwords borrowed from English. [sent-3, score-0.097]
</p><p>3 However, while the motivations for borrowing are well studied, including e. [sent-4, score-0.069]
</p><p>4 the need to express concepts that do not have  corresponding expressions in the recipient language, and the social prestige associated with the other language (Hock and Joseph, 1996), the dynamics ofthis process are poorly understood. [sent-6, score-0.047]
</p><p>5 While mainstream political debates often frame borrowing as evidence of cultural or linguistic decline, it is particularly pervasive in youth culture, which is often heavily influenced by North American trends. [sent-7, score-0.069]
</p><p>6 In many countries around the globe, hip hop fans form communities in which novel, creative uses of English are highly valued (Pennycook, 2007), indicative of group membership, and relatively frequent. [sent-8, score-0.951]
</p><p>7 We therefore study which factors contribute to the uptake of (hip hoprelated) anglicisms in an online community of German hip hop fans over a span of 11years. [sent-9, score-1.448]

</p><p>21 Our final system consists of a binary classifier augmented with dictionary lookup for known words and two routines to deal with German morphology (affixation and compounding). [sent-49, score-0.108]
</p><p>22 The baseline classifier We used MALLET (McCallum, 2002) to train a maximum entropy classifier, using character 1- through 6-grams (including word boundaries) as features. [sent-50, score-0.055]
</p><p>23 Since we could not manually annotate a large portion of the MZEE corpus, the training data consisted of the disjoint subsets of the English and German CELEX wordlists (Baayen et al. [sent-51, score-0.06]
</p><p>24 , 1995), as well as the words used in Covo (to obtain coverage of hip hop English). [sent-52, score-0.858]
</p><p>25 We tested the classifier using 10-fold cross validation on the training data and on a manually annotated development set of 10K consecutive tokens from MZEE. [sent-53, score-0.083]
</p><p>26 Affix-stripping Since German is a moderately inflected language, anglicisms are often ‘hidden’ by German morphology: in geflowt ‘flowed’, the English stem flow takes German participial affixes. [sent-56, score-0.588]
</p><p>27 We therefore included a template-based affix-stripping preprocessing step, removing common German affixes before feature extraction. [sent-57, score-0.044]
</p><p>28 Our list of affixes was built 136  TAynafebosilx1:CTyonmeosp. [sent-61, score-0.044]

</p><p>33 Parameter values were optimized on a subset of compounds from the development set. [sent-77, score-0.063]
</p><p>34 Dictionary classification When applying the classifier to the MZEE corpus, words which occur exclusively in one of the German and English CELEX wordlists are automatically classified as such. [sent-78, score-0.16]
</p><p>35 This improved classifier results over tokens and types, as seen in Table 1 in the comparison of token and type precision for the dict/nodict conditions. [sent-79, score-0.083]
</p><p>36 Evaluation We evaluated our system by adjusting the classifier threshold to obtain a recall level of95% or higher on anglicism tokens in the development set (see Table 1). [sent-80, score-0.222]
</p><p>37 The final classifier achieved a pertoken precision of 70% (per type: 67%) at 95% recall, a gain of 7% (9%) over the baseline. [sent-81, score-0.055]
</p><p>38 Our system identified 1,415 anglicism candidate types with a corpus frequency of 100 or greater, out of which we identified 851 (57. [sent-82, score-0.309]

</p><p>40 4  Predicting the fate of anglicisms  We examine here factors hypothesized to play a role in the establishment (or decline) of anglicisms. [sent-86, score-0.622]
</p><p>41 Frequency in the English Covo corpus We first examine whether a word’s frequency in the Englishspeaking hip hop community influences whether it becomes more frequently used in the German hip hop community. [sent-87, score-1.852]
</p><p>42 We aligned four large (> 1M words each) 12-month time windows of the Covo and MZEE corpora, spanning the period 11-2003 through 11-2007. [sent-88, score-0.063]
</p><p>43 We used the 85 1 most frequent anglicisms identified in our system to find 106 English stems commonly used in German anglicisms, and compute their relative frequency (aggregated over all word forms) in each Covo and MZEE time window. [sent-89, score-0.735]
</p><p>44 There is a significant positive correlation between the variables, especially for change over a two-year time span. [sent-91, score-0.117]
</p><p>45 5) found that the measures DU (dissemination over users) and DT (dissemination over threads) predict changes in word frequency (∆ log10 f) better than initial word fre137  Figure 2: Correlation coefficient comparison of DU, DT, log10 f with ∆ log10 f quency (log10 f). [sent-98, score-0.173]
</p><p>46 DU = UU˜ww is defined as the ratio of the actual number of users of word w (Uw) over the expected number of users of w (U˜w), and DT = TT˜ww is calculated analogously fo the actual/expected number of threads in which w is used. [sent-99, score-0.076]
</p><p>47 ’s model to study the difference in word dynamics between anglicisms and native words. [sent-102, score-0.544]
</p><p>48 Since we are not able to lemmatize the entire MZEE corpus, this study uses the 851 most common anglicism word forms identified by our system, treating all word forms as distinct. [sent-103, score-0.202]
</p><p>49 We split the MZEE corpus into six non-overlapping windows of 2M words each (T1 through T6), cal-  culate DtU(w), DtT(w) and log10 ft(w) within each time window Tt. [sent-104, score-0.063]
</p><p>50 We again measure how well these variables predict the change in log frequency ∆ log10 ft:u(w) = log10 fu(w) − log10 ft(w) between the initial time Tt and( a )l −ater l otigme Tu, with u = t + 1, . [sent-105, score-0.258]
</p><p>51 When measured over all words excluding anglicisms, log10 ft, DtU, and DtT at an initial time are very weakly (0. [sent-109, score-0.068]
</p><p>52 ’s findings that DU and DT serve better than frequency as predictors of word fate, for the set of anglicisms (Table 3), all correlations were both negative and stronger, and initial frequency log10 ft (not dissemination) is the best predictor, especially as the time spans increase in length. [sent-114, score-0.842]
</p><p>53 That is, while most words’ frequency change cannot generally be predicted from earlier frequency, we find that, for anglicisms, a high frequency is more likely to lead to a decline, and vice versa. [sent-115, score-0.306]

</p><p>56 Finally, from the comparison of timespans in Table 3, we see that the predictive ability (R2) of the three measures increases as the timespan for ∆ log10 f becomes longer, i. [sent-120, score-0.099]
</p><p>57 , frequency and dissemination effects on frequency change do not operate as strongly in immediate time scales. [sent-122, score-0.484]
</p><p>58 5  Conclusion  In this study, we examined factors hypothesized to influence the propagation of words through a community of speakers, focusing on anglicisms in a German hip hop discussion corpus. [sent-124, score-1.441]
</p><p>59 , hip hop lyrics), but the strength of this correlation is highest in a two-year timespan, suggesting a time lag from the frequency of hip hop terms in English to the effects on those terms in German. [sent-127, score-1.843]
</p><p>60 Future research here could profitably focus on this relationship, especially for terms whose success in the English and German hip hop communities is highly disparate. [sent-128, score-0.92]
</p><p>61 Investigation of those terms could suggest non-frequency factors which affect a word’s variables) in this regard. [sent-129, score-0.039]
</p><p>62 2An analysis which truncated the forms in the first two timespans to match the N of the third confirm that this increase is not simply an effect of the number of cases considered. [sent-130, score-0.059]
</p><p>63 In a diachronic study of loanword frequencies in two French newspaper corpora, Chesley and Baayen (2010, p. [sent-133, score-0.04]
</p><p>64 1364-5) found that high initial frequency was ”a bad omen for a borrowing” and found an interaction effect between frequency and dispersion (roughly equivalent to dissemination in the present study): ”As dispersion and frequency increase, the number of occurrences at T2 decreases. [sent-134, score-0.616]
</p><p>65 ” A view of language as a stylistic resource (Coupland, 2007) provides some explanation for these counter-intuitive findings: An anglicism which is used less often initially but survives is likely to increase in frequency as other speakers adopt it for  ’cred’ or in-group prestige. [sent-135, score-0.281]
</p><p>66 However, a highly frequent anglicism seems to become increasingly undesirable–after all, if everyone is using it, it loses its capacity to distinguish in-group members (consider, e. [sent-136, score-0.178]
</p><p>67 , the widespread adoption of the term bling outside hip hop culture in the US). [sent-138, score-0.864]
</p><p>68 This circumstance is reflected by a drop in frequency as the word becomes This view is supported by ethnographic interviews with members of the German hip hop community: “Yeah, [the use of anglicisms is] naturally overdone, for the most part. [sent-139, score-1.474]

<p>Author: Kareem Darwish ; Ahmed Ali</p><p>Abstract: Due to Arabic’s morphological complexity, Arabic retrieval benefits greatly from morphological analysis – particularly stemming. However, the best known stemming does not handle linguistic phenomena such as broken plurals and malformed stems. In this paper we propose a model of character-level morphological transformation that is trained using Wikipedia hypertext to page title links. The use of our model yields statistically significant improvements in Arabic retrieval over the use of the best statistical stemming technique. The technique can potentially be applied to other languages.</p><p>3 0.036600895 <a title="39-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Word_Epoch_Disambiguation%3A_Finding_How_Words_Change_Over_Time.html">216 acl-2012-Word Epoch Disambiguation: Finding How Words Change Over Time</a></p>

The problem was motivated by an attempt to collect a large amount of linguistic data for non-major languages from the web. The problem is formulated in terms of obtaining the minimum description length of a text, and the proposed solution finds the segments and their languages through dynamic programming. Empirical results demonstrating the potential of this approach are presented for experiments using texts taken from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Wikipedia, covering more than 200 languages.</p><p>6 0.029637555 <a title="39-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Crosslingual_Induction_of_Semantic_Roles.html">64 acl-2012-Crosslingual Induction of Semantic Roles</a></p>

<p>Author: Rada Mihalcea ; Vivi Nastase</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce the novel task of “word epoch disambiguation,” defined as the problem of identifying changes in word usage over time. Through experiments run using word usage examples collected from three major periods of time (1800, 1900, 2000), we show that the task is feasible, and significant differences can be observed between occurrences of words in different periods of time.</p><p>3 0.53071022 <a title="39-lsi-3" href="./acl-2012-Syntactic_Annotations_for_the_Google_Books_NGram_Corpus.html">189 acl-2012-Syntactic Annotations for the Google Books NGram Corpus</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuri Lin ; Jean-Baptiste Michel ; Erez Aiden Lieberman ; Jon Orwant ; Will Brockman ; Slav Petrov</p><p>Abstract: We present a new edition of the Google Books Ngram Corpus, which describes how often words and phrases were used over a period of five centuries, in eight languages; it reflects 6% of all books ever published. This new edition introduces syntactic annotations: words are tagged with their part-of-speech, and headmodifier relationships are recorded. The annotations are produced automatically with statistical models that are specifically adapted to historical text. The corpus will facilitate the study of linguistic trends, especially those related to the evolution of syntax.</p><p>4 0.46222922 <a title="39-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-Toward_Automatically_Assembling_Hittite-Language_Cuneiform_Tablet_Fragments_into_Larger_Texts.html">200 acl-2012-Toward Automatically Assembling Hittite-Language Cuneiform Tablet Fragments into Larger Texts</a></p>
<p>Author: Stephen Tyndall</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents the problem within Hittite and Ancient Near Eastern studies of fragmented and damaged cuneiform texts, and proposes to use well-known text classification metrics, in combination with some facts about the structure of Hittite-language cuneiform texts, to help classify a number offragments of clay cuneiform-script tablets into more complete texts. In particular, Ipropose using Sumerian and Akkadian ideogrammatic signs within Hittite texts to improve the performance of Naive Bayes and Maximum Entropy classifiers. The performance in some cases is improved, and in some cases very much not, suggesting that the variable frequency of occurrence of these ideograms in individual fragments makes considerable difference in the ideal choice for a classification method. Further, complexities of the writing system and the digital availability ofHittite texts complicate the problem.</p><p>5 0.4360491 <a title="39-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-Demonstration_of_IlluMe%3A_Creating_Ambient_According_to_Instant_Message_Logs.html">70 acl-2012-Demonstration of IlluMe: Creating Ambient According to Instant Message Logs</a></p>
<p>Author: Lun-Wei Ku ; Cheng-Wei Sun ; Ya-Hsin Hsueh</p><p>Abstract: We present IlluMe, a software tool pack which creates a personalized ambient using the music and lighting. IlluMe includes an emotion analysis software, the small space ambient lighting, and a multimedia controller. The software analyzes emotional changes from instant message logs and corresponds the detected emotion to the best sound and light settings. The ambient lighting can sparkle with different forms of light and the smart phone can broadcast music respectively according to different atmosphere. All settings can be modified by the multimedia controller at any time and the new settings will be feedback to the emotion analysis software. The IlluMe system, equipped with the learning function, provides a link between residential situation and personal emotion. It works in a Chinese chatting environment to illustrate the language technology in life.</p><p>6 0.42614758 <a title="39-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-A_Comprehensive_Gold_Standard_for_the_Enron_Organizational_Hierarchy.html">6 acl-2012-A Comprehensive Gold Standard for the Enron Organizational Hierarchy</a></p>

<p>Author: Fangtao Li ; Sinno Jialin Pan ; Ou Jin ; Qiang Yang ; Xiaoyan Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Extracting sentiment and topic lexicons is important for opinion mining. Previous works have showed that supervised learning methods are superior for this task. However, the performance of supervised methods highly relies on manually labeled training data. In this paper, we propose a domain adaptation framework for sentiment- and topic- lexicon co-extraction in a domain of interest where we do not require any labeled data, but have lots of labeled data in another related domain. The framework is twofold. In the first step, we generate a few high-confidence sentiment and topic seeds in the target domain. In the second step, we propose a novel Relational Adaptive bootstraPping (RAP) algorithm to expand the seeds in the target domain by exploiting the labeled source domain data and the relationships between topic and sentiment words. Experimental results show that our domain adaptation framework can extract precise lexicons in the target domain without any annotation.</p><p>3 0.33713132 <a title="39-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-UWN%3A_A_Large_Multilingual_Lexical_Knowledge_Base.html">206 acl-2012-UWN: A Large Multilingual Lexical Knowledge Base</a></p>
<p>Author: Gerard de Melo ; Gerhard Weikum</p><p>Abstract: We present UWN, a large multilingual lexical knowledge base that describes the meanings and relationships of words in over 200 languages. This paper explains how link prediction, information integration and taxonomy induction methods have been used to build UWN based on WordNet and extend it with millions of named entities from Wikipedia. We additionally introduce extensions to cover lexical relationships, frame-semantic knowledge, and language data. An online interface provides human access to the data, while a software API enables applications to look up over 16 million words and names.</p><p>4 0.33704382 <a title="39-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Modified_Distortion_Matrices_for_Phrase-Based_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">148 acl-2012-Modified Distortion Matrices for Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Arianna Bisazza ; Marcello Federico</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel method to suggest long word reorderings to a phrase-based SMT decoder. We address language pairs where long reordering concentrates on few patterns, and use fuzzy chunk-based rules to predict likely reorderings for these phenomena. Then we use reordered n-gram LMs to rank the resulting permutations and select the n-best for translation. Finally we encode these reorderings by modifying selected entries of the distortion cost matrix, on a per-sentence basis. In this way, we expand the search space by a much finer degree than if we simply raised the distortion limit. The proposed techniques are tested on Arabic-English and German-English using well-known SMT benchmarks.</p><p>5 0.33695486 <a title="39-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Genre_Independent_Subgroup_Detection_in_Online_Discussion_Threads%3A_A_Study_of_Implicit_Attitude_using_Textual_Latent_Semantics.html">102 acl-2012-Genre Independent Subgroup Detection in Online Discussion Threads: A Study of Implicit Attitude using Textual Latent Semantics</a></p>
<p>Author: Pradeep Dasigi ; Weiwei Guo ; Mona Diab</p><p>Abstract: We describe an unsupervised approach to the problem of automatically detecting subgroups of people holding similar opinions in a discussion thread. An intuitive way of identifying this is to detect the attitudes of discussants towards each other or named entities or topics mentioned in the discussion. Sentiment tags play an important role in this detection, but we also note another dimension to the detection of people’s attitudes in a discussion: if two persons share the same opinion, they tend to use similar language content. We consider the latter to be an implicit attitude. In this paper, we investigate the impact of implicit and explicit attitude in two genres of social media discussion data, more formal wikipedia discussions and a debate discussion forum that is much more informal. Experimental results strongly suggest that implicit attitude is an important complement for explicit attitudes (expressed via sentiment) and it can improve the sub-group detection performance independent of genre.</p><p>6 0.3368516 <a title="39-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Joint_Feature_Selection_in_Distributed_Stochastic_Learning_for_Large-Scale_Discriminative_Training_in_SMT.html">123 acl-2012-Joint Feature Selection in Distributed Stochastic Learning for Large-Scale Discriminative Training in SMT</a></p>

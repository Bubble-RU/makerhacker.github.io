One of the major challenges for multilingual chat realized through machine translation technology is the normalization of non-standard, self-created short-forms in the chat message to standard words before translation. Due to the lack of training data and the variations of short-forms used among different social communities, it is hard to normalize and translate chat messages if user uses vocabularies outside the training data and create short-forms freely.

<p>Author: Alexandre Davis ; Adriano Veloso ; Altigran Soares ; Alberto Laender ; Wagner Meira Jr.</p><p>Abstract: The named entity disambiguation task is to resolve the many-to-many correspondence between ambiguous names and the unique realworld entity. This task can be modeled as a classification problem, provided that positive and negative examples are available for learning binary classifiers. High-quality senseannotated data, however, are hard to be obtained in streaming environments, since the training corpus would have to be constantly updated in order to accomodate the fresh data coming on the stream. On the other hand, few positive examples plus large amounts of unlabeled data may be easily acquired. Producing binary classifiers directly from this data, however, leads to poor disambiguation performance. Thus, we propose to enhance the quality of the classifiers using finer-grained variations of the well-known ExpectationMaximization (EM) algorithm. We conducted a systematic evaluation using Twitter streaming data and the results show that our classifiers are extremely effective, providing improvements ranging from 1% to 20%, when compared to the current state-of-the-art biased SVMs, being more than 120 times faster.</p><p>3 0.11281724 <a title="160-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-IRIS%3A_a_Chat-oriented_Dialogue_System_based_on_the_Vector_Space_Model.html">114 acl-2012-IRIS: a Chat-oriented Dialogue System based on the Vector Space Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Fei Liu ; Fuliang Weng ; Xiao Jiang</p><p>Abstract: Social media language contains huge amount and wide variety of nonstandard tokens, created both intentionally and unintentionally by the users. It is of crucial importance to normalize the noisy nonstandard tokens before applying other NLP techniques. A major challenge facing this task is the system coverage, i.e., for any user-created nonstandard term, the system should be able to restore the correct word within its top n output candidates. In this paper, we propose a cognitivelydriven normalization system that integrates different human perspectives in normalizing the nonstandard tokens, including the enhanced letter transformation, visual priming, and string/phonetic similarity. The system was evaluated on both word- and messagelevel using four SMS and Twitter data sets. Results show that our system achieves over 90% word-coverage across all data sets (a . 10% absolute increase compared to state-ofthe-art); the broad word-coverage can also successfully translate into message-level performance gain, yielding 6% absolute increase compared to the best prior approach.</p><p>5 0.09441334 <a title="160-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Ecological_Evaluation_of_Persuasive_Messages_Using_Google_AdWords.html">77 acl-2012-Ecological Evaluation of Persuasive Messages Using Google AdWords</a></p>

<p>Author: Tsung-Ting Kuo ; San-Chuan Hung ; Wei-Shih Lin ; Nanyun Peng ; Shou-De Lin ; Wei-Fen Lin</p><p>Abstract: This paper brings a marriage of two seemly unrelated topics, natural language processing (NLP) and social network analysis (SNA). We propose a new task in SNA which is to predict the diffusion of a new topic, and design a learning-based framework to solve this problem. We exploit the latent semantic information among users, topics, and social connections as features for prediction. Our framework is evaluated on real data collected from public domain. The experiments show 16% AUC improvement over baseline methods. The source code and dataset are available at http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~d97944007/dif fusion/ 1 Background The diffusion of information on social networks has been studied for decades. Generally, the proposed strategies can be categorized into two categories, model-driven and data-driven. The model-driven strategies, such as independent cascade model (Kempe et al., 2003), rely on certain manually crafted, usually intuitive, models to fit the diffusion data without using diffusion history. The data-driven strategies usually utilize learning-based approaches to predict the future propagation given historical records of prediction (Fei et al., 2011; Galuba et al., 2010; Petrovic et al., 2011). Data-driven strategies usually perform better than model-driven approaches because the past diffusion behavior is used during learning (Galuba et al., 2010). Recently, researchers started to exploit content information in data-driven diffusion models (Fei et al., 2011; Petrovic et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2011). 344 However, most of the data-driven approaches assume that in order to train a model and predict the future diffusion of a topic, it is required to obtain historical records about how this topic has propagated in a social network (Petrovic et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2011). We argue that such assumption does not always hold in the real-world scenario, and being able to forecast the propagation of novel or unseen topics is more valuable in practice. For example, a company would like to know which users are more likely to be the source of ‘viva voce’ of a newly released product for advertising purpose. A political party might want to estimate the potential degree of responses of a half-baked policy before deciding to bring it up to public. To achieve such goal, it is required to predict the future propagation behavior of a topic even before any actual diffusion happens on this topic (i.e., no historical propagation data of this topic are available). Lin et al. also propose an idea aiming at predicting the inference of implicit diffusions for novel topics (Lin et al., 2011). The main difference between their work and ours is that they focus on implicit diffusions, whose data are usually not available. Consequently, they need to rely on a model-driven approach instead of a datadriven approach. On the other hand, our work focuses on the prediction of explicit diffusion behaviors. Despite the fact that no diffusion data of novel topics is available, we can still design a data- driven approach taking advantage of some explicit diffusion data of known topics. Our experiments show that being able to utilize such information is critical for diffusion prediction. 2 The Novel-Topic Diffusion Model We start by assuming an existing social network G = (V, E), where V is the set of nodes (or user) v, and E is the set of link e. The set of topics is Proce dJienjgus, R ofep thueb 5lic0t hof A Knonruea ,l M 8-e1e4ti Jnugly o f2 t0h1e2 A.s ?c so2c0ia1t2io Ans fso rc Ciatoiomnp fuotart Cio nmaplu Ltiantgiounisatlic Lsi,n pgaugiestsi3c 4s4–348, denoted as T. Among them, some are considered as novel topics (denoted as N), while the rest (R) are used as the training records. We are also given a set of diffusion records D = {d | d = (src, dest, t) }, where src is the source node (or diffusion source), dest is the destination node, and t is the topic of the diffusion that belongs to R but not N. We assume that diffusions cannot occur between nodes without direct social connection; any diffusion pair implies the existence of a link e = (src, dest) ∈ E. Finally, we assume there are sets of keywords or tags that relevant to each topic (including existing and novel topics). Note that the set of keywords for novel topics should be seen in that of existing topics. From these sets of keywords, we construct a topicword matrix TW = (P(wordj | topici))i,j of which the elements stand for the conditional probabilities that a word appears in the text of a certain topic. Similarly, we also construct a user-word matrix UW= (P(wordj | useri))i,j from these sets of keywords. Given the above information, the goal is to predict whether a given link is active (i.e., belongs to a diffusion link) for topics in N. 2.1 The Framework The main challenge of this problem lays in that the past diffusion behaviors of new topics are missing. To address this challenge, we propose a supervised diffusion discovery framework that exploits the latent semantic information among users, topics, and their explicit / implicit interactions. Intuitively, four kinds of information are useful for prediction: • Topic information: Intuitively, knowing the signatures of a topic (e.g., is it about politics?) is critical to the success of the prediction. • User information: The information of a user such as the personality (e.g., whether this user is aggressive or passive) is generally useful. • User-topic interaction: Understanding the users' preference on certain topics can improve the quality of prediction. • Global information: We include some global features (e.g., topology info) of social network. Below we will describe how these four kinds of information can be modeled in our framework. 2.2 Topic Information We extract hidden topic category information to model topic signature. In particular, we exploit the 345 Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method (Blei et al., 2003), which is a widely used topic modeling technique, to decompose the topic-word matrix TW into hidden topic categories: TW = TH * HW , where TH is a topic-hidden matrix, HW is hiddenword matrix, and h is the manually-chosen parameter to determine the size of hidden topic categories. TH indicates the distribution of each topic to hidden topic categories, and HW indicates the distribution of each lexical term to hidden topic categories. Note that TW and TH include both existing and novel topics. We utilize THt,*, the row vector of the topic-hidden matrix TH for a topic t, as a feature set. In brief, we apply LDA to extract the topic-hidden vector THt,* to model topic signature (TG) for both existing and novel topics. Topic information can be further exploited. To predict whether a novel topic will be propagated through a link, we can first enumerate the existing topics that have been propagated through this link. For each such topic, we can calculate its similarity with the new topic based on the hidden vectors generated above (e.g., using cosine similarity between feature vectors). Then, we sum up the similarity values as a new feature: topic similarity (TS). For example, a link has previously propagated two topics for a total of three times {ACL, KDD, ACL}, and we would like to know whether a new topic, EMNLP, will propagate through this link. We can use the topic-hidden vector to generate the similarity values between EMNLP and the other topics (e.g., {0.6, 0.4, 0.6}), and then sum them up (1.6) as the value of TS. 2.3 User Information Similar to topic information, we extract latent personal information to model user signature (the users are anonymized already). We apply LDA on the user-word matrix UW: UW = UM * MW , where UM is the user-hidden matrix, MW is the hidden-word matrix, and m is the manually-chosen size of hidden user categories. UM indicates the distribution of each user to the hidden user categories (e.g., age). We then use UMu,*, the row vector of UM for the user u, as a feature set. In brief, we apply LDA to extract the user-hidden vector UMu,* for both source and destination nodes of a link to model user signature (UG). 2.4 User-Topic Interaction Modeling user-topic interaction turns out to be non-trivial. It is not useful to exploit latent semantic analysis directly on the user-topic matrix UR = UQ * QR , where UR represents how many times each user is diffused for existing topic R (R ∈ T), because UR does not contain information of novel topics, and neither do UQ and QR. Given no propagation record about novel topics, we propose a method that allows us to still extract implicit user-topic information. First, we extract from the matrix TH (described in Section 2.2) a subset RH that contains only information about existing topics. Next we apply left division to derive another userhidden matrix UH: UH = (RH \ URT)T = ((RHT RH )-1 RHT URT)T Using left division, we generate the UH matrix using existing topic information. Finally, we exploit UHu,*, the row vector of the user-hidden matrix UH for the user u, as a feature set. Note that novel topics were included in the process of learning the hidden topic categories on RH; therefore the features learned here do implicitly utilize some latent information of novel topics, which is not the case for UM. Experiments confirm the superiority of our approach. Furthermore, our approach ensures that the hidden categories in topic-hidden and user-hidden matrices are identical. Intuitively, our method directly models the user’s preference to topics’ signature (e.g., how capable is this user to propagate topics in politics category?). In contrast, the UM mentioned in Section 2.3 represents the users’ signature (e.g., aggressiveness) and has nothing to do with their opinions on a topic. In short, we obtain the user-hidden probability vector UHu,* as a feature set, which models user preferences to latent categories (UPLC). 2.5 Global Features Given a candidate link, we can extract global social features such as in-degree (ID) and outdegree (OD). We tried other features such as PageRank values but found them not useful. Moreover, we extract the number of distinct topics (NDT) for a link as a feature. The intuition behind this is that the more distinct topics a user has diffused to another, the more likely the diffusion will happen for novel topics. 346 2.6 Complexity Analysis The complexity to produce each feature is as below: (1) Topic information: O(I * |T| * h * Bt) for LDA using Gibbs sampling, where Iis # of the iterations in sampling, |T| is # of topics, and Bt is the average # of tokens in a topic. (2) User information: O(I * |V| * m * Bu) , where |V| is # of users, and Bu is the average # of tokens for a user. (3) User-topic interaction: the time complexity is O(h3 + h2 * |T| + h * |T| * |V|). (4) Global features: O(|D|), where |D| is # of diffusions. 3 Experiments For evaluation, we try to use the diffusion records of old topics to predict whether a diffusion link exists between two nodes given a new topic. 3.1 Dataset and Evaluation Metric We first identify 100 most popular topic (e.g., earthquake) from the Plurk micro-blog site between 01/201 1 and 05/201 1. Plurk is a popular micro-blog service in Asia with more than 5 million users (Kuo et al., 2011). We manually separate the 100 topics into 7 groups. We use topic-wise 4-fold cross validation to evaluate our method, because there are only 100 available topics. For each group, we select 3/4 of the topics as training and 1/4 as validation. The positive diffusion records are generated based on the post-response behavior. That is, if a person x posts a message containing one of the selected topic t, and later there is a person y responding to this message, we consider a diffusion of t has occurred from x to y (i.e., (x, y, t) is a positive instance). Our dataset contains a total of 1,642,894 positive instances out of 100 distinct topics; the largest and smallest topic contains 303,424 and 2,166 diffusions, respectively. Also, the same amount of negative instances for each topic (totally 1,642,894) is sampled for binary classification (similar to the setup in KDD Cup 2011 Track 2). The negative links of a topic t are sampled randomly based on the absence of responses for that given topic. The underlying social network is created using the post-response behavior as well. We assume there is an acquaintance link between x and y if and only if x has responded to y (or vice versa) on at least one topic. Eventually we generated a social network of 163,034 nodes and 382,878 links. Furthermore, the sets of keywords for each topic are required to create the TW and UW matrices for latent topic analysis; we simply extract the content of posts and responses for each topic to create both matrices. We set the hidden category number h = m = 7, which is equal to the number of topic groups. We use area under ROC curve (AUC) to evaluate our proposed framework (Davis and Goadrich, 2006); we rank the testing instances based on their likelihood of being positive, and compare it with the ground truth to compute AUC. 3.2 Implementation and Baseline After trying many classifiers and obtaining similar results for all of them, we report only results from LIBLINEAR with c=0.0001 (Fan et al., 2008) due to space limitation. We remove stop-words, use SCWS (Hightman, 2012) for tokenization, and MALLET (McCallum, 2002) and GibbsLDA++ (Phan and Nguyen, 2007) for LDA. There are three baseline models we compare the result with. First, we simply use the total number of existing diffusions among all topics between two nodes as the single feature for prediction. Second, we exploit the independent cascading model (Kempe et al., 2003), and utilize the normalized total number of diffusions as the propagation probability of each link. Third, we try the heat diffusion model (Ma et al., 2008), set initial heat proportional to out-degree, and tune the diffusion time parameter until the best results are obtained. Note that we did not compare with any data-driven approaches, as we have not identified one that can predict diffusion of novel topics. 3.3 Results The result of each model is shown in Table 1. All except two features outperform the baseline. The best single feature is TS. Note that UPLC performs better than UG, which verifies our hypothesis that maintaining the same hidden features across different LDA models is better. We further conduct experiments to evaluate different combinations of features (Table 2), and found that the best one (TS + ID + NDT) results in about 16% improvement over the baseline, and outperforms the combination of all features. As stated in (Witten et al., 2011), 347 adding useless features may cause the performance of classifiers to deteriorate. Intuitively, TS captures both latent topic and historical diffusion information, while ID and NDT provide complementary social characteristics of users. 4 Conclusions The main contributions of this paper are as below: 1. We propose a novel task of predicting the diffusion of unseen topics, which has wide applications in real-world. 2. Compared to the traditional model-driven or content-independent data-driven works on diffusion analysis, our solution demonstrates how one can bring together ideas from two different but promising areas, NLP and SNA, to solve a challenging problem. 3. Promising experiment result (74% in AUC) not only demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed models, but also indicates that predicting diffusion of unseen topics without historical diffusion data is feasible.

<p>Author: Rebecca Dridan ; Stephan Oepen</p><p>Abstract: We examine some of the frequently disregarded subtleties of tokenization in Penn Treebank style, and present a new rule-based preprocessing toolkit that not only reproduces the Treebank tokenization with unmatched accuracy, but also maintains exact stand-off pointers to the original text and allows flexible configuration to diverse use cases (e.g. to genreor domain-specific idiosyncrasies). 1 Introduction—Motivation The task of tokenization is hardly counted among the grand challenges of NLP and is conventionally interpreted as breaking up “natural language text [...] into distinct meaningful units (or tokens)” (Kaplan, 2005). Practically speaking, however, tokenization is often combined with other string-level preprocessing—for example normalization of punctuation (of different conventions for dashes, say), disambiguation of quotation marks (into opening vs. closing quotes), or removal of unwanted mark-up— where the specifics of such pre-processing depend both on properties of the input text as well as on assumptions made in downstream processing. Applying some string-level normalizationprior to the identification of token boundaries can improve (or simplify) tokenization, and a sub-task like the disambiguation of quote marks would in fact be hard to perform after tokenization, seeing that it depends on adjacency to whitespace. In the following, we thus assume a generalized notion of tokenization, comprising all string-level processing up to and including the conversion of a sequence of characters (a string) to a sequence of token objects.1 1Obviously, some of the normalization we include in the tokenization task (in this generalized interpretation) could be left to downstream analysis, where a tagger or parser, for example, could be expected to accept non-disambiguated quote marks (so-called straight or typewriter quotes) and disambiguate as 378 Arguably, even in an overtly ‘separating’ language like English, there can be token-level ambiguities that ultimately can only be resolved through parsing (see § 3 for candidate examples), and indeed Waldron et al. (2006) entertain the idea of downstream processing on a token lattice. In this article, however, we accept the tokenization conventions and sequential nature of the Penn Treebank (PTB; Marcus et al., 1993) as a useful point of reference— primarily for interoperability of different NLP tools. Still, we argue, there is remaining work to be done on PTB-compliant tokenization (reviewed in§ 2), both methodologically, practically, and technologically. In § 3 we observe that state-of-the-art tools perform poorly on re-creating PTB tokenization, and move on in § 4 to develop a modular, parameterizable, and transparent framework for tokenization. Besides improvements in tokenization accuracy and adaptability to diverse use cases, in § 5 we further argue that each token object should unambiguously link back to an underlying element of the original input, which in the case of tokenization of text we realize through a notion of characterization. 2 Common Conventions Due to the popularity of the PTB, its tokenization has been a de-facto standard for two decades. Ap- proximately, this means splitting off punctuation into separate tokens, disambiguating straight quotes, and separating contractions such as can’t into ca and n ’t. There are, however, many special cases— part of syntactic analysis. However, on the (predominant) point of view that punctuation marks form tokens in their own right, the tokenizer would then have to adorn quote marks in some way, as to whether they were split off the left or right periphery of a larger token, to avoid unwanted syntactic ambiguity. Further, increasing use of Unicode makes texts containing ‘natively’ disambiguated quotes more common, where it would seem unfortunate to discard linguistically pertinent information by normalizing towards the poverty of pure ASCII punctuation.

In much tagging and parsing work, PTB data has been used with gold-standard tokens, to a point where many researchers are unaware of the existence of the original ‘raw’ (untokenized) text. Accordingly, the formal definition of PTB has received little attention, but reproducing PTB tokenization automatically actually is not a trivial task (see § 3). As the NLP community has moved to process data other than the PTB, some of the limitations of the tokenization2 PTB tokenization have been recognized, and many recently released data sets are accompanied by a note on tokenization along the lines of: Tokenization is similar to that used in PTB, except . . . Most exceptions are to do with hyphenation, or special forms of named entities such as chemical names or URLs. None of the documentation with extant data sets is sufficient to fully reproduce the tokenization.3 The CoNLL 2008 Shared Task data actually provided two forms of tokenization: that from the PTB (which many pre-processing tools would have been trained on), and another form that splits (most) hyphenated terms. This latter convention recently seems to be gaining ground in data sets like the Google 1T n-gram corpus (LDC #2006T13) and OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006). Clearly, as one moves towards a more application- and domaindriven idea of ‘correct’ tokenization, a more transparent, flexible, and adaptable approach to stringlevel pre-processing is called for. 3 A Contrastive Experiment To get an overview of current tokenization methods, we recovered and tokenized the raw text which was the source of the (Wall Street Journal portion of the) PTB, and compared it to the gold tokenization in the syntactic annotation in the We used three common methods of tokenization: (a) the original treebank.4 2See http : / /www . cis .upenn .edu/ ~t reebank/ t okeni z at ion .html for available ‘documentation’ and a sed script for PTB-style tokenization. 3Øvrelid et al. (2010) observe that tokenizing with the GENIA tagger yields mismatches in one of five sentences of the GENIA Treebank, although the GENIA guidelines refer to scripts that may be available on request (Tateisi & Tsujii, 2006). 4The original WSJ text was last included with the 1995 release of the PTB (LDC #95T07) and required alignment with the treebank, with some manual correction so that the same text is represented in both raw and parsed formats. 379 Tokenization Differing Levenshtein Method Sentences Distance tokenizer.sed 3264 11168 CoreNLP 1781 3717 C&J; parser 2597 4516 Table 1: Quantitative view on tokenization differences. PTB tokenizer.sed script; (b) the tokenizer from the Stanford CoreNLP tools5; and (c) tokenization from the parser of Charniak & Johnson (2005). Table 1 shows quantitative differences between each of the three methods and the PTB, both in terms of the number of sentences where the tokenization differs, and also in the total Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein, 1966) over tokens (for a total of 49,208 sentences and 1,173,750 gold-standard tokens). Looking at the differences qualitatively, the most consistent issue across all tokenization methods was ambiguity of sentence-final periods. In the treebank, final periods are always (with about 10 exceptions) a separate token. If the sentence ends in U.S. (but not other abbreviations, oddly), an extra period is hallucinated, so the abbreviation also has one. In contrast, C&J; add a period to all final abbreviations, CoreNLP groups the final period with a final abbreviation and hence lacks a sentence-final period token, and the sed script strips the period off U.S. The ‘correct’ choice in this case is not obvious and will depend on how the tokens are to be used. The majority of the discrepancies in the sed script tokenization come from an under-restricted punctuation rule that incorrectly splits on commas within numbers or ampersands within names. Other than that, the problematic cases are mostly shared across tokenization methods, and include issues with currencies, Irish names, hyphenization, and quote disambiguation. In addition, C&J; make some additional modifications to the text, lemmatising expressions such as won ’t as will and n ’t. 4 REPP: A Generalized Framework For tokenization to be studied as a first-class problem, and to enable customization and flexibility to diverse use cases, we suggest a non-procedural, rule-based framework dubbed REPP (Regular 5See corenlp / / nlp . st anford . edu / so ftware / run in ‘ st rict Treebank3 ’ mode. http : . shtml, Expression-Based Pre-Processing)—essentially a cascade of ordered finite-state string rewriting rules, though transcending the formal complexity of regular languages by inclusion of (a) full perl-compatible regular expressions and (b) fixpoint iteration over groups of rules. In this approach, a first phase of string-level substitutions inserts whitespace around, for example, punctuation marks; upon completion of string rewriting, token boundaries are stipulated between all whitespace-separated substrings (and only these). For a good balance of human and machine readability, REPP tokenization rules are specified in a simple, line-oriented textual form. Figure 1 shows a (simplified) excerpt from our PTB-style tokenizer, where the first character on each line is one of four REPP operators, as follows: (a) ‘#’ for group formation; (b) ‘>’ for group invocation, (c) ‘ ! ’ for substitution (allowing capture groups), and (d) ‘ : ’ for token boundary detection.6 In Figure 1, the two rules stripping off prefix and suffix punctuation marks adjacent to whitespace (i.e. matching the tab-separated left-hand side of the rule, to replace the match with its right-hand side) form a numbered group (‘# 1’), which will be iterated when called (‘> 1 until none ’) of the rules in the group fires (a fixpoint). In this example, conditioning on whitespace adjacency avoids the issues observed with the PTB sed script (e.g. token boundaries within comma-separated numbers) and also protects against infinite loops in the group.7 REPP rule sets can be organized as modules, typ6Strictly speaking, there are another two operators, for lineoriented comments and automated versioning of rule files. 7For this example, the same effects seemingly could be obtained without iteration (using greatly more complex rules); our actual, non-simplified rules, however, further deal with punctuation marks that can function as prefixes or suffixes, as well as with corner cases like factor(s) or Ca[2+]. Also in mark-up removal and normalization, we have found it necessary to ‘parse’ nested structures by means of iterative groups. 380 ically each in a file of its own, and invoked selectively by name (e.g. ‘>wiki’ in Figure 1); to date, there exist modules for quote disambiguation, (relevant subsets of) various mark-up languages (HTML, LATEX, wiki, and XML), and a handful of robustness rules (e.g. seeking to identify and repair ‘sandwiched’ inter-token punctuation). Individual tokenizers are configured at run-time, by selectively activating a set of modules (through command-line op- tions). An open-source reference implementation of the REPP framework (in C++) is available, together with a library of modules for English. 5 Characterization for Traceability Tokenization, and specifically our notion of generalized tokenization which allows text normalization, involves changes to the original text being analyzed, rather than just additional annotation. As such, full traceability from the token objects to the original text is required, which we formalize as ‘characterization’, in terms of character position links back to the source.8 This has the practical benefit of allowing downstream analysis as direct (stand-off) annotation on the source text, as seen for example in the ACL Anthology Searchbench (Schäfer et al., 2011). With our general regular expression replacement rules in REPP, making precise what it means for a token to link back to its ‘underlying’ substring requires some care in the design and implementation. Definite characterization links between the string before (I) and after (O) the application of a single orurele ( can only bftee res (tOab)li tshheed a pinp lcicerattiaoinn positions, viz.

Each character in the string being processed has a start and end position, marking the point before and after the character in the original string. Before processing, the end position would always be one greater than the start position. However, if a rule mapped a string-initial, PTB-style opening double quote (``) to one-character Unicode “, the new first character of the string would have start position 0, but end position 2. In contrast, if there were a rule !wo (n’ t ) will \1 (1) applied to the string I ’t go!, all characters in the won second token of the resulting string (I will n’t go!) will have start position 2 and end position 4.

When repeating the experiment of § 3 above using REPP tokenization, we obtained an initial difference in 1505 sentences, with a Levenshtein dis10This subtlety will actually be invisible in the final token objects if will remains a single token, but if subsequent rules were to split this token further, all its output tokens would have a start position of 2 and an end position of 4. While this example may seem unlikely, we have come across similar scenarios in fine-tuning actual REPP rules. 381 tance of 3543 (broadly comparable to CoreNLP, if marginally more accurate). Examining these discrepancies, we revealed some deficiencies in our rules, as well as some peculiarities of the ‘raw’ Wall Street Journal text from the PTB distribution. A little more than 200 mismatches were owed to improper treatment of currency symbols (AU$) and decade abbreviations (’60s), which led to the refinement of two existing rules. Notable PTB idiosyncrasies (in the sense of deviations from common typography) include ellipses with spaces separating the periods and a fairly large number of possessives (’s) being separated from their preceding token. Other aspects of gold-standard PTB tokenization we consider unwarranted ‘damage’ to the input text, such as hallucinating an extra period after U . S . and splitting cannot (which adds spurious ambiguity). For use cases where the goal were strict compliance, for instance in pre-processing inputs for a PTB-derived parser, we added an optional REPP module (of currently half a dozen rules) to cater to these corner cases—in a spirit similar to the CoreNLP mode we used in § 3. With these extra rules, remaining tokenization discrepancies are contained in 603 sentences (just over 1%), which gives a Levenshtein distance of 1389. 7 Discussion—Conclusion Compared to the best-performing off-the-shelf system in our earlier experiment (where it is reasonable to assume that PTB data has played at least some role in development), our results eliminate two thirds of the remaining tokenization errors—a more substantial reduction than recent improvements in parsing accuracy against the PTB, for example. Of the remaining differences, cerned with mid-sentence at least half of those riod was separated treebank—a pattern Some differences over 350 are con- period ambiguity, are instances where where from an abbreviation a pein the we do not wish to emulate. in quote disambiguation also re- main, often triggered by whitespace on both sides of quote marks in the raw text. The final 200 or so dif- ferences stem from manual corrections made during treebanking, and we consider that these cases could not be replicated automatically in any generalizable fashion.

<p>Author: Geoffrey Zweig ; John C. Platt ; Christopher Meek ; Christopher J.C. Burges ; Ainur Yessenalina ; Qiang Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of sentencelevel semantic coherence by answering SATstyle sentence completion questions. These questions test the ability of algorithms to distinguish sense from nonsense based on a variety of sentence-level phenomena. We tackle the problem with two approaches: methods that use local lexical information, such as the n-grams of a classical language model; and methods that evaluate global coherence, such as latent semantic analysis. We evaluate these methods on a suite of practice SAT questions, and on a recently released sentence completion task based on data taken from five Conan Doyle novels. We find that by fusing local and global information, we can exceed 50% on this task (chance baseline is 20%), and we suggest some avenues for further research.</p><p>4 0.089524552 <a title="145-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-A_Probabilistic_Model_for_Canonicalizing_Named_Entity_Mentions.html">18 acl-2012-A Probabilistic Model for Canonicalizing Named Entity Mentions</a></p>
<p>Author: Dani Yogatama ; Yanchuan Sim ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We present a statistical model for canonicalizing named entity mentions into a table whose rows represent entities and whose columns are attributes (or parts of attributes). The model is novel in that it incorporates entity context, surface features, firstorder dependencies among attribute-parts, and a notion of noise. Transductive learning from a few seeds and a collection of mention tokens combines Bayesian inference and conditional estimation. We evaluate our model and its components on two datasets collected from political blogs and sports news, finding that it outperforms a simple agglomerative clustering approach and previous work.</p><p>5 0.077095419 <a title="145-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Joint_Learning_of_a_Dual_SMT_System_for_Paraphrase_Generation.html">125 acl-2012-Joint Learning of a Dual SMT System for Paraphrase Generation</a></p>
<p>Author: Hong Sun ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: SMT has been used in paraphrase generation by translating a source sentence into another (pivot) language and then back into the source. The resulting sentences can be used as candidate paraphrases ofthe source sentence. Existing work that uses two independently trained SMT systems cannot directly optimize the paraphrase results. Paraphrase criteria especially the paraphrase rate is not able to be ensured in that way. In this paper, we propose a joint learning method of two SMT systems to optimize the process of paraphrase generation. In addition, a revised BLEU score (called iBLEU) which measures the adequacy and diversity of the generated paraphrase sentence is proposed for tuning parameters in SMT systems. Our experiments on NIST 2008 testing data with automatic evaluation as well as human judgments suggest that the proposed method is able to enhance the paraphrase quality by adjusting between semantic equivalency and surface dissimilarity.</p><p>6 0.073518351 <a title="145-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Tweet_Recommendation_with_Graph_Co-Ranking.html">205 acl-2012-Tweet Recommendation with Graph Co-Ranking</a></p>

<p>Author: Eric Huang ; Richard Socher ; Christopher Manning ; Andrew Ng</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised word representations are very useful in NLP tasks both as inputs to learning algorithms and as extra word features in NLP systems. However, most of these models are built with only local context and one representation per word. This is problematic because words are often polysemous and global context can also provide useful information for learning word meanings. We present a new neural network architecture which 1) learns word embeddings that better capture the semantics of words by incorporating both local and global document context, and 2) accounts for homonymy and polysemy by learning multiple embeddings per word. We introduce a new dataset with human judgments on pairs of words in sentential context, and evaluate our model on it, showing that our model outperforms competitive baselines and other neural language models. 1</p><p>5 0.45975015 <a title="145-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-Historical_Analysis_of_Legal_Opinions_with_a_Sparse_Mixed-Effects_Latent_Variable_Model.html">110 acl-2012-Historical Analysis of Legal Opinions with a Sparse Mixed-Effects Latent Variable Model</a></p>
<p>Author: William Yang Wang ; Elijah Mayfield ; Suresh Naidu ; Jeremiah Dittmar</p><p>Abstract: We propose a latent variable model to enhance historical analysis of large corpora. This work extends prior work in topic modelling by incorporating metadata, and the interactions between the components in metadata, in a general way. To test this, we collect a corpus of slavery-related United States property law judgements sampled from the years 1730 to 1866. We study the language use in these legal cases, with a special focus on shifts in opinions on controversial topics across different regions. Because this is a longitudinal data set, we are also interested in understanding how these opinions change over the course of decades. We show that the joint learning scheme of our sparse mixed-effects model improves on other state-of-the-art generative and discriminative models on the region and time period identification tasks. Experiments show that our sparse mixed-effects model is more accurate quantitatively and qualitatively interesting, and that these improvements are robust across different parameter settings.</p><p>6 0.44139811 <a title="145-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-A_Feature-Rich_Constituent_Context_Model_for_Grammar_Induction.html">11 acl-2012-A Feature-Rich Constituent Context Model for Grammar Induction</a></p>

<p>Author: Patrick Pantel ; Thomas Lin ; Michael Gamon</p><p>Abstract: We predict entity type distributions in Web search queries via probabilistic inference in graphical models that capture how entitybearing queries are generated. We jointly model the interplay between latent user intents that govern queries and unobserved entity types, leveraging observed signals from query formulations and document clicks. We apply the models to resolve entity types in new queries and to assign prior type distributions over an existing knowledge base. Our models are efficiently trained using maximum likelihood estimation over millions of real-world Web search queries. We show that modeling user intent significantly improves entity type resolution for head queries over the state ofthe art, on several metrics, without degradation in tail query performance.</p><p>2 0.93351519 <a title="145-lda-2" href="./acl-2012-Automated_Essay_Scoring_Based_on_Finite_State_Transducer%3A_towards_ASR_Transcription_of_Oral_English_Speech.html">32 acl-2012-Automated Essay Scoring Based on Finite State Transducer: towards ASR Transcription of Oral English Speech</a></p>
<p>Author: Xingyuan Peng ; Dengfeng Ke ; Bo Xu</p><p>Abstract: Conventional Automated Essay Scoring (AES) measures may cause severe problems when directly applied in scoring Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcription as they are error sensitive and unsuitable for the characteristic of ASR transcription. Therefore, we introduce a framework of Finite State Transducer (FST) to avoid the shortcomings. Compared with the Latent Semantic Analysis with Support Vector Regression (LSA-SVR) method (stands for the conventional measures), our FST method shows better performance especially towards the ASR transcription. In addition, we apply the synonyms similarity to expand the FST model. The final scoring performance reaches an acceptable level of 0.80 which is only 0.07 lower than the correlation (0.87) between human raters.</p><p>3 0.92838115 <a title="145-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-A_Meta_Learning_Approach_to_Grammatical_Error_Correction.html">15 acl-2012-A Meta Learning Approach to Grammatical Error Correction</a></p>

<p>Author: Weiwei Guo ; Mona Diab</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we study unsupervised word sense disambiguation (WSD) based on sense definition. We learn low-dimensional latent semantic vectors of concept definitions to construct a more robust sense similarity measure wmfvec. Experiments on four all-words WSD data sets show significant improvement over the baseline WSD systems and LDA based similarity measures, achieving results comparable to state of the art WSD systems.</p><p>6 0.84174901 <a title="145-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Modeling_Review_Comments.html">144 acl-2012-Modeling Review Comments</a></p>

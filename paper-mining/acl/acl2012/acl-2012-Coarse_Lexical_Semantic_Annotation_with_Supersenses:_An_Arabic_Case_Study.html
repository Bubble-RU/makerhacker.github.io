</p><p>2 In this paper, we repurpose WordNet’s supersense tags for annotation, developing specific guidelines for nominal expressions and applying them to Arabic Wikipedia articles in four topical domains. [sent-7, score-0.709]
</p><p>3 1 Introduction The goal of “lightweight” semantic annotation of text, particularly in scenarios with limited resources and expertise, presents several requirements for a representation: simplicity; adaptability to new languages, topics, and genres; and coverage. [sent-9, score-0.23]
</p><p>4 This paper describes coarse lexical semantic annotation  of Arabic Wikipedia  articles subject to these con-  straints. [sent-10, score-0.291]
</p><p>5 Traditional lexical semantic representations are either narrow in scope, like named make reference  to a full-fledged  entities,1  or  lexicon/ontology,  which may insufficiently cover the language/domain of interest or require prohibitive fort to  apply. [sent-11, score-0.095]
</p><p>6 2  expertise and ef-  We therefore turn to supersense tags  (SSTs), 40 coarse lexical semantic classes (25 for nouns, 15 for verbs) originating in WordNet. [sent-12, score-0.73]

</p><p>15 Part of the earliest versions of WordNet, the supersense categories (originally, “lexicographer classes”) were intended to partition all English noun and verb senses into broad groupings, or semantic fields (Miller, 1990; Fellbaum, 1990). [sent-99, score-0.615]
</p><p>16 More recently, the task of automatic supersense tagging has emerged for English (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003; Curran, 2005; Ciaramita and Altun, 2006; Paaß and Reichartz, 2009), as well as for Italian (Picca et al. [sent-100, score-0.632]

</p><p>21 Counts exclude sentences marked as problematic and mentions marked ? [sent-117, score-0.155]
</p><p>22 We encapsulate our interpretation of the tags in a set of brief guidelines that aims to be usable by anyone who can read and understand a text in the target language; our annotators had no prior expertise in linguistics or linguistic annotation. [sent-124, score-0.244]
</p><p>23 Finally, we note that ad hoc categorization schemes not unlike SSTs have been developed for purposes ranging from question answering (Li and Roth, 2002) to animacy hierarchy representation for corpus linguistics (Zaenen et al. [sent-125, score-0.042]
</p><p>24 We believe the interpretation of the SSTs adopted here can serve as a single starting point for diverse resource engineering efforts and applications, especially when fine-grained sense annotation is not feasible. [sent-127, score-0.191]
</p><p>25 2  Tagging Conventions  WordNet’s definitions of the supersenses are terse, and we could find little explicit discussion of the specific rationales behind each category. [sent-128, score-0.114]
</p><p>26 Thus, we have crafted more specific explanations, summarized for nouns in figure 2. [sent-129, score-0.079]
</p><p>27 English examples are given, but the guidelines are intended to be language-neutral. [sent-130, score-0.083]
</p><p>28 5 In developing these guidelines we consulted English WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and SemCor (Miller et al. [sent-132, score-0.14]
</p><p>29 3  Arabic Wikipedia Annotation  The annotation in this work was on top of a small corpus of Arabic Wikipedia articles that had already been annotated for named entities (Mohit et al. [sent-139, score-0.24]
</p><p>30 The dataset (table 1) consists of the main text of 28 articles selected from the topical domains of history, sports, science, and technology. [sent-143, score-0.058]
</p><p>31 The annotation task was to identify and categorize  mentions, i. [sent-144, score-0.134]
</p><p>32 Working in a custom, browserbased interface, annotators were to tag each relevant token with a supersense category by selecting the token and typing a tag symbol. [sent-147, score-0.754]
</p><p>33 Any token could be marked as continuing a multiword unit by typing <. [sent-148, score-0.092]
</p><p>34 If the annotator was ambivalent about a token they were to mark it with the ? [sent-149, score-0.111]
</p><p>35 Over several months, annotators alternately annotated sentences from 2 designated articles of each domain, and reviewed the annotations for consistency. [sent-154, score-0.156]
</p><p>36 All tagging conventions were developed collaboratively by the author(s) and annotators during this period, informed by points of confusion and disagreement. [sent-155, score-0.269]
</p><p>37 WordNet and SemCor were consulted as part of developing the guidelines, but not during annotation itself so as to avoid complicating the annotation process or overfitting to WordNet’s idiosyncracies. [sent-156, score-0.325]
</p><p>38 The training phase ended once interannotator mention F1 had reached 75%. [sent-157, score-0.074]
</p><p>39 6Suggestions  came  from the previous named entity annota-  tion of PERSONs, organizations (GROUP), and LOCATIONs, as well as heuristic lookup in lexical resources—Arabic WordNet entries (Elkateb et al. [sent-158, score-0.048]

</p><p>45 Throughout the process, annotators were encouraged to discuss points of confusion with each other, but each sentence was annotated in its entirety and never revisited. [sent-175, score-0.145]
</p><p>46 To measure inter-annotator agreement, 87 sentences (2,774 tokens) distributed across 19 of the articles (not including those used in pilot rounds) were annotated independently by each annotator. [sent-182, score-0.058]
</p><p>47 Interannotator mention F1 (counting agreement over entire mentions and their labels) was 70%. [sent-183, score-0.109]
</p><p>48 Excluding the 1,397 tokens left blank by both annotators, the token-level agreement rate was 71%, with Cohen’s κ = 0. [sent-184, score-0.05]
</p><p>49 7 We also measured agreement on a tag-by-tag ba-  sis. [sent-186, score-0.05]
</p><p>50 An examination of the confusion matrix reveals four pairs of supersense categories that tended to provoke the most disagreement: COMMUNICATION/COGNITION, ACT/COGNITION, ACT/PROCESS, and ARTIFACT/COMMUNICATION. [sent-189, score-0.615]
</p><p>51 7Token-level measures consider both the supersense label and whether it begins or continues the mention. [sent-190, score-0.568]

</p><p>53 Also in that sentence, annotators disagreed on the second use of university (ARTIFACT vs. [sent-192, score-0.098]
</p><p>54 As with any sense annotation effort, some disagreements due to legitimate ambiguity and different interpretations of the tags— especially the broadest ones—are unavoidable. [sent-194, score-0.191]
</p><p>55 A “soft” agreement measure (counting as matches any two mentions with the same label and at least one token in common) gives an F1 of 79%, show-  ing that boundary decisions account for a major portion of the disagreement. [sent-195, score-0.153]
</p><p>56 , the city Fez, Morocco (figure 1) was tagged as a single LOCATION by one annotator and as two by the other. [sent-198, score-0.134]
</p><p>57 Further examples include the technical term ‘thin client’, for which one annotator omitted the adjective; and ‘World Cup Football Championship’, where one annotator tagged the entire phrase as an EVENT while the other tagged ‘football’ as a separate ACT. [sent-199, score-0.268]
</p><p>58 4  Conclusion  We have codified supersense tags as a simple annotation scheme for coarse lexical semantics, and have shown that supersense annotation of Arabic Wikipedia can be rapid, reliable, and robust (about half the tokens in our data are covered by a nominal supersense).

<p>Author: Spence Green ; John DeNero</p><p>Abstract: When automatically translating from a weakly inflected source language like English to a target language with richer grammatical features such as gender and dual number, the output commonly contains morpho-syntactic agreement errors. To address this issue, we present a target-side, class-based agreement model. Agreement is promoted by scoring a sequence of fine-grained morpho-syntactic classes that are predicted during decoding for each translation hypothesis. For English-to-Arabic translation, our model yields a +1.04 BLEU average improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline. The model does not require bitext or phrase table annotations and can be easily implemented as a feature in many phrase-based decoders. 1</p><p>3 0.11736114 <a title="49-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-UWN%3A_A_Large_Multilingual_Lexical_Knowledge_Base.html">206 acl-2012-UWN: A Large Multilingual Lexical Knowledge Base</a></p>

This paper explains how link prediction, information integration and taxonomy induction methods have been used to build UWN based on WordNet and extend it with millions of named entities from Wikipedia. We additionally introduce extensions to cover lexical relationships, frame-semantic knowledge, and language data. An online interface provides human access to the data, while a software API enables applications to look up over 16 million words and names.</p><p>4 0.11640296 <a title="49-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Transforming_Standard_Arabic_to_Colloquial_Arabic.html">202 acl-2012-Transforming Standard Arabic to Colloquial Arabic</a></p>

When used in POS tagging, this process improves the accuracy from 73.24% to 86.84% on unseen CEA text, and reduces the percentage of out-ofvocabulary words from 28.98% to 16.66%. The process holds promise for any NLP task targeting the dialectal varieties of Arabic; e.g., this approach may provide a cheap way to leverage MSA data and morphological resources to create resources for colloquial Arabic to English machine translation. It can also considerably speed up the annotation of Arabic dialects.</p><p>5 0.091587268 <a title="49-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Arabic_Retrieval_Revisited%3A_Morphological_Hole_Filling.html">27 acl-2012-Arabic Retrieval Revisited: Morphological Hole Filling</a></p>
<p>Author: Kareem Darwish ; Ahmed Ali</p><p>Abstract: Due to Arabic’s morphological complexity, Arabic retrieval benefits greatly from morphological analysis – particularly stemming. However, the best known stemming does not handle linguistic phenomena such as broken plurals and malformed stems. In this paper we propose a model of character-level morphological transformation that is trained using Wikipedia hypertext to page title links. The use of our model yields statistically significant improvements in Arabic retrieval over the use of the best statistical stemming technique. The technique can potentially be applied to other languages.</p><p>6 0.083805725 <a title="49-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Collective_Classification_for_Fine-grained_Information_Status.html">50 acl-2012-Collective Classification for Fine-grained Information Status</a></p>

<p>Author: Nathan Schneider ; Behrang Mohit ; Kemal Oflazer ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: “Lightweight” semantic annotation of text calls for a simple representation, ideally without requiring a semantic lexicon to achieve good coverage in the language and domain. In this paper, we repurpose WordNet’s supersense tags for annotation, developing specific guidelines for nominal expressions and applying them to Arabic Wikipedia articles in four topical domains. The resulting corpus has high coverage and was completed quickly with reasonable inter-annotator agreement.</p><p>2 0.62969369 <a title="49-lsi-2" href="./acl-2012-The_Creation_of_a_Corpus_of_English_Metalanguage.html">195 acl-2012-The Creation of a Corpus of English Metalanguage</a></p>
<p>Author: Shomir Wilson</p><p>Abstract: Metalanguage is an essential linguistic mechanism which allows us to communicate explicit information about language itself. However, it has been underexamined in research in language technologies, to the detriment of the performance of systems that could exploit it. This paper describes the creation of the first tagged and delineated corpus of English metalanguage, accompanied by an explicit definition and a rubric for identifying the phenomenon in text. This resource will provide a basis for further studies of metalanguage and enable its utilization in language technologies.</p><p>3 0.5782612 <a title="49-lsi-3" href="./acl-2012-UWN%3A_A_Large_Multilingual_Lexical_Knowledge_Base.html">206 acl-2012-UWN: A Large Multilingual Lexical Knowledge Base</a></p>
<p>Author: Gerard de Melo ; Gerhard Weikum</p><p>Abstract: We present UWN, a large multilingual lexical knowledge base that describes the meanings and relationships of words in over 200 languages. This paper explains how link prediction, information integration and taxonomy induction methods have been used to build UWN based on WordNet and extend it with millions of named entities from Wikipedia. We additionally introduce extensions to cover lexical relationships, frame-semantic knowledge, and language data. An online interface provides human access to the data, while a software API enables applications to look up over 16 million words and names.</p><p>4 0.55290228 <a title="49-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-Transforming_Standard_Arabic_to_Colloquial_Arabic.html">202 acl-2012-Transforming Standard Arabic to Colloquial Arabic</a></p>
<p>Author: Emad Mohamed ; Behrang Mohit ; Kemal Oflazer</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for generating Colloquial Egyptian Arabic (CEA) from morphologically disambiguated Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). When used in POS tagging, this process improves the accuracy from 73.24% to 86.84% on unseen CEA text, and reduces the percentage of out-ofvocabulary words from 28.98% to 16.66%. The process holds promise for any NLP task targeting the dialectal varieties of Arabic; e.g., this approach may provide a cheap way to leverage MSA data and morphological resources to create resources for colloquial Arabic to English machine translation. It can also considerably speed up the annotation of Arabic dialects.</p><p>5 0.53624809 <a title="49-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-A_Computational_Approach_to_the_Automation_of_Creative_Naming.html">7 acl-2012-A Computational Approach to the Automation of Creative Naming</a></p>
<p>Author: Gozde Ozbal ; Carlo Strapparava</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a computational approach to generate neologisms consisting of homophonic puns and metaphors based on the category of the service to be named and the properties to be underlined. We describe all the linguistic resources and natural language processing techniques that we have exploited for this task. Then, we analyze the performance of the system that we have developed. The empirical results show that our approach is generally effective and it constitutes a solid starting point for the automation ofthe naming process.</p><p>6 0.53066176 <a title="49-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-Collective_Classification_for_Fine-grained_Information_Status.html">50 acl-2012-Collective Classification for Fine-grained Information Status</a></p>

<p>Author: Nicola Cancedda</p><p>Abstract: Some Statistical Machine Translation systems never see the light because the owner of the appropriate training data cannot release them, and the potential user ofthe system cannot disclose what should be translated. We propose a simple and practical encryption-based method addressing this barrier.</p><p>3 0.78506839 <a title="49-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-ACCURAT_Toolkit_for_Multi-Level_Alignment_and_Information_Extraction_from_Comparable_Corpora.html">1 acl-2012-ACCURAT Toolkit for Multi-Level Alignment and Information Extraction from Comparable Corpora</a></p>
<p>Author: Marcis Pinnis ; Radu Ion ; Dan Stefanescu ; Fangzhong Su ; Inguna Skadina ; Andrejs Vasiljevs ; Bogdan Babych</p><p>Abstract: The lack of parallel corpora and linguistic resources for many languages and domains is one of the major obstacles for the further advancement of automated translation. A possible solution is to exploit comparable corpora (non-parallel bi- or multi-lingual text resources) which are much more widely available than parallel translation data. Our presented toolkit deals with parallel content extraction from comparable corpora. It consists of tools bundled in two workflows: (1) alignment of comparable documents and extraction of parallel sentences and (2) extraction and bilingual mapping of terms and named entities. The toolkit pairs similar bilingual comparable documents and extracts parallel sentences and bilingual terminological and named entity dictionaries from comparable corpora. This demonstration focuses on the English, Latvian, Lithuanian, and Romanian languages.</p><p>4 0.62222612 <a title="49-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Computational_Approaches_to_Sentence_Completion.html">56 acl-2012-Computational Approaches to Sentence Completion</a></p>
<p>Author: Geoffrey Zweig ; John C. Platt ; Christopher Meek ; Christopher J.C. Burges ; Ainur Yessenalina ; Qiang Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of sentencelevel semantic coherence by answering SATstyle sentence completion questions. These questions test the ability of algorithms to distinguish sense from nonsense based on a variety of sentence-level phenomena. We tackle the problem with two approaches: methods that use local lexical information, such as the n-grams of a classical language model; and methods that evaluate global coherence, such as latent semantic analysis. We evaluate these methods on a suite of practice SAT questions, and on a recently released sentence completion task based on data taken from five Conan Doyle novels. We find that by fusing local and global information, we can exceed 50% on this task (chance baseline is 20%), and we suggest some avenues for further research.</p><p>5 0.37033245 <a title="49-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-CSNIPER_-_Annotation-by-query_for_Non-canonical_Constructions_in_Large_Corpora.html">44 acl-2012-CSNIPER - Annotation-by-query for Non-canonical Constructions in Large Corpora</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Eckart de Castilho ; Sabine Bartsch ; Iryna Gurevych</p><p>Abstract: We present CSNIPER (Corpus Sniper), a tool that implements (i) a web-based multiuser scenario for identifying and annotating non-canonical grammatical constructions in large corpora based on linguistic queries and (ii) evaluation of annotation quality by measuring inter-rater agreement. This annotationby-query approach efficiently harnesses expert knowledge to identify instances of linguistic phenomena that are hard to identify by means of existing automatic annotation tools.</p><p>6 0.36649695 <a title="49-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-UWN%3A_A_Large_Multilingual_Lexical_Knowledge_Base.html">206 acl-2012-UWN: A Large Multilingual Lexical Knowledge Base</a></p>

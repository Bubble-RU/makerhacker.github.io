</p><p>2 In this work, we show how to predict what the learning curve would look like if we were to manually translate increasing amounts of data. [sent-3, score-0.579]
</p><p>3 We consider two scenarios, 1) Monolingual samples in the source and target languages are available and 2) An additional small amount of parallel corpus is also available. [sent-4, score-0.354]
</p><p>4 We propose methods for predicting learning curves in both these scenarios. [sent-5, score-0.403]
</p><p>5 In many cases it is possible to allocate some budget for manually translating a limited sample of relevant documents, be it via professional translation services or through increasingly fashionable crowdsourcing. [sent-7, score-0.145]
</p><p>6 However, it is often difficult to predict how much training data will be required to achieve satisfactory translation accuracy, preventing sound provisional budgetting. [sent-8, score-0.214]
</p><p>7 This prediction, or more generally the prediction of the learning curve of an SMT system as a function of available in-domain parallel data, is the objective of this paper. [sent-9, score-0.635]
</p><p>8 In the first scenario (S1), the SMT developer is given only monolingual source and target samples from the relevant domain, and a small test parallel corpus. [sent-12, score-0.488]
</p><p>9 In the second scenario (S2), an additional small seed parallel corpus is given that can be used to train small in-domain models and measure  (with some variance) the evaluation score at a few points on the initial portion of the learning curve. [sent-15, score-0.482]
</p><p>10 In both cases, the task consists in predicting an evaluation score (BLEU, throughout this work) on the test corpus as a function of the size of a subset of the source sample, assuming that we could have it manually translated and use the resulting bilingual corpus for training.

</p><p>14 Our experiments involve 30 distinct language pair and domain combinations and 96 different learning curves. [sent-30, score-0.104]
</p><p>15 They show that without any parallel data we can predict the expected translation accuracy at 75K segments within an error of 6 BLEU points (Ta-  ble 4), while using a seed training corpus of 10K segments narrows this error to within 1. [sent-31, score-0.612]
</p><p>16 2  Related Work  Learning curves are routinely used to illustrate how the performance of experimental methods depend on the amount of training data used. [sent-33, score-0.364]
</p><p>17 (2003) used learning curves to compare performance for various meta-parameter settings such as maximum phrase length, while Turchi et al. [sent-35, score-0.327]
</p><p>18 (2008) extensively studied the behaviour of learning curves under a number of test conditions on Spanish-English. [sent-36, score-0.375]
</p><p>19 Their results showed that the most predictive features were the morphological complexity of the languages, their linguistic relatedness and their word-order divergence; in our work, we make use of these features, among others, for predicting translation accuracy (Section 4). [sent-39, score-0.141]
</p><p>20 (2003) used learning curves for predicting maximum performance bounds of learning algorithms and to  compare them. [sent-41, score-0.479]
</p><p>21 (2001), the learning curves of two classification algorithms were modelled for eight different large data sets. [sent-43, score-0.327]
</p><p>22 This work uses similar a priori knowledge for restricting the form of learning curves as ours (see Section 3), and also similar empirical evaluation criteria for comparing curve families with one another. [sent-44, score-1.042]
</p><p>23 While both application and performance metric in our work are different, we arrive at a similar conclusion that a power law family of the form y = c − a x−α is a gpoowode rm laowdel f aomf tilhye olefar thnein fgo crmurv yes =. [sent-45, score-0.199]
</p><p>24 Learning curves are also frequently used for determining empirically the number of iterations for an incremental learning procedure. [sent-46, score-0.327]
</p><p>25 The crucial difference in our work is that in the previous cases, learning curves are plotted a posteriori i. [sent-47, score-0.327]
</p><p>26 once the labelled data has become available and the training has been performed, whereas 23 in our work the learning curve itself is the object of the prediction. [sent-49, score-0.514]
</p><p>27 Our goal is to learn to predict what the learning curve will be a priori without having to label the data at all (S1), or through labelling only a very small amount of it (S2). [sent-50, score-0.662]
</p><p>28 In this respect, the academic field of Computa-  tional Learning Theory has a similar goal, since it strives to identify bounds to performance measures1 , typically including a dependency on the training sample size. [sent-51, score-0.153]
</p><p>29 3  Selecting a parametric family of curves  The first step in our approach consists in selecting a suitable family of shapes for the learning curves that we want to produce in the two scenarios being considered. [sent-53, score-1.233]
</p><p>30 For a certain bilingual test dataset d, we consider a set of observations Od = {(x1, y1) , (x2, y2) . [sent-55, score-0.143]

</p><p>32 The corpus size xi is measured in terms of the number of segments (sentences) present in the parallel corpus. [sent-60, score-0.332]
</p><p>33 We consider such observations to be generated by a regression model of the form: yi  = F(xi; θ) + ? [sent-61, score-0.211]
</p><p>34 Based on our prior knowledge of the problem, we limit the search for a suitable F to families that satisfies the following conditions- monotonically increasing, concave and bounded. [sent-64, score-0.278]
</p><p>35 The second condition expresses a notion of “diminishing returns”, namely that a given amount of additional training data is more advantageous when added to a small rather than to a big amount of initial data. [sent-66, score-0.211]
</p><p>36 We consider six possible families of functions satisfying these conditions, which are listed in Table 1. [sent-69, score-0.272]

</p><p>39 We decided to only select families with three or four parameters. [sent-72, score-0.269]

</p><p>41 (xn, yn)} and a curve family F(x; θ) from Table 1, we compute a best fit where:  ˆθ-  Xn  θˆ = argmθinXi=1[yi− F(xi;θ)]2,  (2)  through use of the Levenberg-Marquardt method (Mor e´, 1978) for non-linear regression. [sent-76, score-0.747]
</p><p>42 For selecting a learning curve family, and for all  other experiments in this paper, we trained a large number of systems on multiple configurations of training sets and sample sizes, and tested each on multiple test sets; these are listed in Table 2. [sent-77, score-0.693]

</p><p>48 Average root mean-squared error (RMSE):  N1Xc∈StX∈Tc(n1iX=n1[yi− F(xi;θˆ)]2)c1t/2 where S is the set of training datasets, Tc is the set of test datasets for training configuration c, is as defined in Eq. [sent-92, score-0.347]

</p><p>52 The average values of the root meansquared error and the average residuals across all the learning curves used in our experiments are shown in this table. [sent-100, score-0.594]

</p><p>56 The only available parallel resource is a very small test corpus. [sent-108, score-0.217]
</p><p>57 Our objective is to predict the evolution of the BLEU score on the given test set as a function of the size of a random subset of the training data  that we manually translate4. [sent-109, score-0.25]
</p><p>58 25 The intuition behind  this is that the source-side and target-side monolingual data already convey significant information about the difficulty of the translation task. [sent-110, score-0.186]

</p><p>61 We then perform inference using these models to predict the BLEU score at each anchor, for the test case of interest. [sent-120, score-0.12]
</p><p>62 We finally estimate the parameters of the learning curve by weighted least squares regression using the anchor predictions. [sent-121, score-0.943]
</p><p>63 Anchor sizes can be chosen rather arbitrarily, but must satisfy the following two constraints: 1. [sent-122, score-0.105]
</p><p>64 They must be three or more in number in order to allow fitting the tri-parameter curve. [sent-123, score-0.16]

[sent-132, score-0.586]
</p><p>67 4We specify that it is a random sample as opposed to a subset deliberately chosen to maximize learning effectiveness. [sent-133, score-0.145]
</p><p>68 Features capturing divergence between languages in the pair:  (a) average ratio of source/target sentence lengths in the test set. [sent-136, score-0.193]
</p><p>69 (b) ratio of type-token ratios of orders 1 to 5 in the monolingual corpus of both source and target languages. [sent-137, score-0.266]
</p><p>70 Word-order divergence: The divergence in the word-order between the source and the target languages can be captured using the part-ofspeech (pos) tag sequences across languages. [sent-139, score-0.183]
</p><p>71 We use cross-entropy measure to capture similarity between the n-gram distributions of the pos tags in the monolingual corpora of the two languages. [sent-140, score-0.121]
</p><p>72 These features capture our intuition that translation is going to be harder if the language in the domain is highly variable and if the source and target languages diverge more in terms of morphology and word-order. [sent-147, score-0.217]
</p><p>73 The training data for fitting these linear models is obtained in the following way. [sent-149, score-0.194]
</p><p>74 For each configuration (combination of language pair and domain) c and test set t in Table 2, a gold curve is fitted using the selected tri-parameter power-law family using a fine grid of corpus sizes. [sent-150, score-0.968]
</p><p>75 This is available as a byproduct of the experiments for comparing different parametric families described in Section 3. [sent-151, score-0.335]
</p><p>76 We then compute the value of the gold curves at the m anchor sizes: we thus have m “gold” vectors µ1, . [sent-152, score-0.691]

</p><p>79 As baseline, we take a constant mean model predicting, for each anchor size sj, the average of all the µjct. [sent-160, score-0.484]
</p><p>80 We do not assume the difficulty of predicting BLEU at all anchor points to be the same. [sent-161, score-0.519]
</p><p>81 To allow for this, we use (non-regularized) weighted leastsquares to fit a curve from our parametric family through the m anchor points6. [sent-162, score-1.203]
</p><p>82 2), the anchor confidence is set to be the inverse of the cross-validated mean square residuals:  ωj= N1Xc∈StX∈Tc(φc>twj\c− µjct)2! [sent-166, score-0.496]

</p><p>84 In other words, we assign to each anchor point a confidence inverse to the crossvalidated mean squared error of the model used to predict it. [sent-168, score-0.787]
</p><p>85 For a new unseen configuration with feature vec-  tor φu, we determine the parameters θu of the corresponding learning curve as:  θu= argmθinXjωj? [sent-169, score-0.631]
</p><p>86 2 5  (5)  Extrapolating a learning curve fitted on a small parallel corpus  Given a small “seed” parallel corpus, the translation system can be used to train small in-domain models and the evaluation score can be measured at a few initial sample sizes {(x1, y1) , (x2, y2) .

</p><p>89 We 6When the number of anchor points is the same as the number of parameters in the parametric family, the curve can be fit exactly through all anchor points. [sent-178, score-1.499]

</p><p>94 1/2  (6)  where ˆη ct are the parameters of the curve fit using the initial points for the combination ct. [sent-185, score-0.79]
</p><p>95 In general, we observed that the extrapolated curve tends to over-estimate BLEU for large samples. [sent-186, score-0.535]

In order to reliably learn a myriad of parameters in these models, we propose an expected BLEU score-based utility function with KL regularization as the objective, and train the models on a large parallel dataset. For training, we derive growth transformations for phrase and lexicon translation probabilities to iteratively improve the objective. The proposed method, evaluated on the Europarl German-to-English dataset, leads to a 1.1 BLEU point improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline translation system.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for translation model adaptation by utilizing in-domain monolingual topic information instead of the in-domain bilingual corpora, which incorporates the topic information into translation probability estimation. Our method establishes the relationship between the out-of-domain bilingual corpus and the in-domain monolingual corpora via topic mapping and phrase-topic distribution probability estimation from in-domain monolingual corpora. Experimental result on the NIST Chinese-English translation task shows that our approach significantly outperforms the baseline system.</p><p>4 0.089766175 <a title="163-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Deciphering_Foreign_Language_by_Combining_Language_Models_and_Context_Vectors.html">67 acl-2012-Deciphering Foreign Language by Combining Language Models and Context Vectors</a></p>
<p>Author: Malte Nuhn ; Arne Mauser ; Hermann Ney</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we show how to train statistical machine translation systems on reallife tasks using only non-parallel monolingual data from two languages. We present a modification of the method shown in (Ravi and Knight, 2011) that is scalable to vocabulary sizes of several thousand words. On the task shown in (Ravi and Knight, 2011) we obtain better results with only 5% of the computational effort when running our method with an n-gram language model. The efficiency improvement of our method allows us to run experiments with vocabulary sizes of around 5,000 words, such as a non-parallel version of the VERBMOBIL corpus. We also report results using data from the monolingual French and English GIGAWORD corpora.</p><p>5 0.08926557 <a title="163-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Joint_Feature_Selection_in_Distributed_Stochastic_Learning_for_Large-Scale_Discriminative_Training_in_SMT.html">123 acl-2012-Joint Feature Selection in Distributed Stochastic Learning for Large-Scale Discriminative Training in SMT</a></p>
<p>Author: Patrick Simianer ; Stefan Riezler ; Chris Dyer</p><p>Abstract: With a few exceptions, discriminative training in statistical machine translation (SMT) has been content with tuning weights for large feature sets on small development data. Evidence from machine learning indicates that increasing the training sample size results in better prediction. The goal of this paper is to show that this common wisdom can also be brought to bear upon SMT. We deploy local features for SCFG-based SMT that can be read off from rules at runtime, and present a learning algorithm that applies ‘1/‘2 regularization for joint feature selection over distributed stochastic learning processes. We present experiments on learning on 1.5 million training sentences, and show significant improvements over tuning discriminative models on small development sets.</p><p>6 0.082956754 <a title="163-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Mixing_Multiple_Translation_Models_in_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">143 acl-2012-Mixing Multiple Translation Models in Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

Since ad-hoc manual translation can represent a significant investment in time and money, a prior assesment of the amount of training data required to achieve a satisfactory accuracy level can be very useful. In this work, we show how to predict what the learning curve would look like if we were to manually translate increasing amounts of data. We consider two scenarios, 1) Monolingual samples in the source and target languages are available and 2) An additional small amount of parallel corpus is also available.

<p>Author: Kevin Duh ; Katsuhito Sudoh ; Xianchao Wu ; Hajime Tsukada ; Masaaki Nagata</p><p>Abstract: We introduce an approach to optimize a machine translation (MT) system on multiple metrics simultaneously. Different metrics (e.g. BLEU, TER) focus on different aspects of translation quality; our multi-objective approach leverages these diverse aspects to improve overall quality. Our approach is based on the theory of Pareto Optimality. It is simple to implement on top of existing single-objective optimization methods (e.g. MERT, PRO) and outperforms ad hoc alternatives based on linear-combination of metrics. We also discuss the issue of metric tunability and show that our Pareto approach is more effective in incorporating new metrics from MT evaluation for MT optimization.</p><p>3 0.67123872 <a title="163-lsi-3" href="./acl-2012-Automatically_Learning_Measures_of_Child_Language_Development.html">34 acl-2012-Automatically Learning Measures of Child Language Development</a></p>
<p>Author: Sam Sahakian ; Benjamin Snyder</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach for the creation of child language development metrics. A set of linguistic features is computed on child speech samples and used as input in two age prediction experiments. In the first experiment, we learn a child-specific metric and predicts the ages at which speech samples were produced. We then learn a more general developmental index by applying our method across children, predicting relative temporal orderings of speech samples. In both cases we compare our results with established measures of language development, showing improvements in age prediction performance.</p><p>4 0.61666811 <a title="163-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-PORT%3A_a_Precision-Order-Recall_MT_Evaluation_Metric_for_Tuning.html">158 acl-2012-PORT: a Precision-Order-Recall MT Evaluation Metric for Tuning</a></p>
<p>Author: Boxing Chen ; Roland Kuhn ; Samuel Larkin</p><p>Abstract: Many machine translation (MT) evaluation metrics have been shown to correlate better with human judgment than BLEU. In principle, tuning on these metrics should yield better systems than tuning on BLEU. However, due to issues such as speed, requirements for linguistic resources, and optimization difficulty, they have not been widely adopted for tuning. This paper presents PORT , a new MT evaluation metric which combines precision, recall and an ordering metric and which is primarily designed for tuning MT systems. PORT does not require external resources and is quick to compute. It has a better correlation with human judgment than BLEU. We compare PORT-tuned MT systems to BLEU-tuned baselines in five experimental conditions involving four language pairs. PORT tuning achieves 1 consistently better performance than BLEU tuning, according to four automated metrics (including BLEU) and to human evaluation: in comparisons of outputs from 300 source sentences, human judges preferred the PORT-tuned output 45.3% of the time (vs. 32.7% BLEU tuning preferences and 22.0% ties). 1</p><p>5 0.60704905 <a title="163-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-Selective_Sharing_for_Multilingual_Dependency_Parsing.html">172 acl-2012-Selective Sharing for Multilingual Dependency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Tahira Naseem ; Regina Barzilay ; Amir Globerson</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel algorithm for multilingual dependency parsing that uses annotations from a diverse set of source languages to parse a new unannotated language. Our motivation is to broaden the advantages of multilingual learning to languages that exhibit significant differences from existing resource-rich languages. The algorithm learns which aspects of the source languages are relevant for the target language and ties model parameters accordingly. The model factorizes the process of generating a dependency tree into two steps: selection of syntactic dependents and their ordering. Being largely languageuniversal, the selection component is learned in a supervised fashion from all the training languages. In contrast, the ordering decisions are only influenced by languages with similar properties. We systematically model this cross-lingual sharing using typological features. In our experiments, the model consistently outperforms a state-of-the-art multilingual parser. The largest improvement is achieved on the non Indo-European languages yielding a gain of 14.4%.1</p><p>6 0.59214693 <a title="163-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-LetsMT%21%3A_Cloud-Based_Platform_for_Do-It-Yourself_Machine_Translation.html">138 acl-2012-LetsMT!: Cloud-Based Platform for Do-It-Yourself Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Deyi Xiong ; Min Zhang ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: Predicate-argument structure contains rich semantic information of which statistical machine translation hasn’t taken full advantage. In this paper, we propose two discriminative, feature-based models to exploit predicateargument structures for statistical machine translation: 1) a predicate translation model and 2) an argument reordering model. The predicate translation model explores lexical and semantic contexts surrounding a verbal predicate to select desirable translations for the predicate. The argument reordering model automatically predicts the moving direction of an argument relative to its predicate after translation using semantic features. The two models are integrated into a state-of-theart phrase-based machine translation system and evaluated on Chinese-to-English transla- , tion tasks with large-scale training data. Experimental results demonstrate that the two models significantly improve translation accuracy.</p><p>4 0.52917379 <a title="163-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Authorship_Attribution_with_Author-aware_Topic_Models.html">31 acl-2012-Authorship Attribution with Author-aware Topic Models</a></p>

In addition, we define a model that combines LDA and AT by representing authors and documents over two disjoint topic sets, and show that our model outperforms LDA, AT and support vector machines on datasets with many authors.</p><p>5 0.52820635 <a title="163-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Semantic_Parsing_with_Bayesian_Tree_Transducers.html">174 acl-2012-Semantic Parsing with Bayesian Tree Transducers</a></p>

However, while tree transformations are central to several state-of-the-art approaches, little use has been made of the rich literature on tree automata. This paper makes the connection concrete with a tree transducer based semantic parsing model and suggests that other models can be interpreted in a similar framework, increasing the generality of their contributions. In particular, this paper further introduces a variational Bayesian inference algorithm that is applicable to a wide class of tree transducers, producing state-of-the-art semantic parsing results while remaining applicable to any domain employing probabilistic tree transducers.</p><p>6 0.52681923 <a title="163-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-A_Topic_Similarity_Model_for_Hierarchical_Phrase-based_Translation.html">22 acl-2012-A Topic Similarity Model for Hierarchical Phrase-based Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Guillermo Garrido ; Anselmo Penas ; Bernardo Cabaleiro ; Alvaro Rodrigo</p><p>Abstract: Although much work on relation extraction has aimed at obtaining static facts, many of the target relations are actually fluents, as their validity is naturally anchored to a certain time period. This paper proposes a methodological approach to temporally anchored relation extraction. Our proposal performs distant supervised learning to extract a set of relations from a natural language corpus, and anchors each of them to an interval of temporal validity, aggregating evidence from documents supporting the relation. We use a rich graphbased document-level representation to generate novel features for this task. Results show that our implementation for temporal anchoring is able to achieve a 69% of the upper bound performance imposed by the relation extraction step. Compared to the state of the art, the overall system achieves the highest precision reported.</p><p>3 0.12529841 <a title="163-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Maximum_Expected_BLEU_Training_of_Phrase_and_Lexicon_Translation_Models.html">141 acl-2012-Maximum Expected BLEU Training of Phrase and Lexicon Translation Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaodong He ; Li Deng</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new discriminative training method in constructing phrase and lexicon translation models. In order to reliably learn a myriad of parameters in these models, we propose an expected BLEU score-based utility function with KL regularization as the objective, and train the models on a large parallel dataset. For training, we derive growth transformations for phrase and lexicon translation probabilities to iteratively improve the objective. The proposed method, evaluated on the Europarl German-to-English dataset, leads to a 1.1 BLEU point improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline translation system. In IWSLT 201 1 Benchmark, our system using the proposed method achieves the best Chinese-to-English translation result on the task of translating TED talks.</p><p>4 0.10342136 <a title="163-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-PORT%3A_a_Precision-Order-Recall_MT_Evaluation_Metric_for_Tuning.html">158 acl-2012-PORT: a Precision-Order-Recall MT Evaluation Metric for Tuning</a></p>
<p>Author: Boxing Chen ; Roland Kuhn ; Samuel Larkin</p><p>Abstract: Many machine translation (MT) evaluation metrics have been shown to correlate better with human judgment than BLEU. In principle, tuning on these metrics should yield better systems than tuning on BLEU. However, due to issues such as speed, requirements for linguistic resources, and optimization difficulty, they have not been widely adopted for tuning. This paper presents PORT , a new MT evaluation metric which combines precision, recall and an ordering metric and which is primarily designed for tuning MT systems. PORT does not require external resources and is quick to compute. It has a better correlation with human judgment than BLEU. We compare PORT-tuned MT systems to BLEU-tuned baselines in five experimental conditions involving four language pairs. PORT tuning achieves 1 consistently better performance than BLEU tuning, according to four automated metrics (including BLEU) and to human evaluation: in comparisons of outputs from 300 source sentences, human judges preferred the PORT-tuned output 45.3% of the time (vs. 32.7% BLEU tuning preferences and 22.0% ties). 1</p><p>5 0.089014523 <a title="163-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Selective_Sharing_for_Multilingual_Dependency_Parsing.html">172 acl-2012-Selective Sharing for Multilingual Dependency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Tahira Naseem ; Regina Barzilay ; Amir Globerson</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel algorithm for multilingual dependency parsing that uses annotations from a diverse set of source languages to parse a new unannotated language. Our motivation is to broaden the advantages of multilingual learning to languages that exhibit significant differences from existing resource-rich languages. The algorithm learns which aspects of the source languages are relevant for the target language and ties model parameters accordingly. The model factorizes the process of generating a dependency tree into two steps: selection of syntactic dependents and their ordering. Being largely languageuniversal, the selection component is learned in a supervised fashion from all the training languages. In contrast, the ordering decisions are only influenced by languages with similar properties. We systematically model this cross-lingual sharing using typological features. In our experiments, the model consistently outperforms a state-of-the-art multilingual parser. The largest improvement is achieved on the non Indo-European languages yielding a gain of 14.4%.1</p><p>6 0.087584794 <a title="163-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Translation_Model_Adaptation_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation_with_Monolingual_Topic_Information.html">203 acl-2012-Translation Model Adaptation for Statistical Machine Translation with Monolingual Topic Information</a></p>

A set of linguistic features is computed on child speech samples and used as input in two age prediction experiments. In the first experiment, we learn a child-specific metric and predicts the ages at which speech samples were produced. We then learn a more general developmental index by applying our method across children, predicting relative temporal orderings of speech samples. In both cases we compare our results with established measures of language development, showing improvements in age prediction performance.</p><p>4 0.51422423 <a title="163-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-Learning_to_Translate_with_Multiple_Objectives.html">136 acl-2012-Learning to Translate with Multiple Objectives</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin Duh ; Katsuhito Sudoh ; Xianchao Wu ; Hajime Tsukada ; Masaaki Nagata</p><p>Abstract: We introduce an approach to optimize a machine translation (MT) system on multiple metrics simultaneously. Different metrics (e.g. BLEU, TER) focus on different aspects of translation quality; our multi-objective approach leverages these diverse aspects to improve overall quality. Our approach is based on the theory of Pareto Optimality. It is simple to implement on top of existing single-objective optimization methods (e.g. MERT, PRO) and outperforms ad hoc alternatives based on linear-combination of metrics. We also discuss the issue of metric tunability and show that our Pareto approach is more effective in incorporating new metrics from MT evaluation for MT optimization.</p><p>5 0.5076859 <a title="163-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-PORT%3A_a_Precision-Order-Recall_MT_Evaluation_Metric_for_Tuning.html">158 acl-2012-PORT: a Precision-Order-Recall MT Evaluation Metric for Tuning</a></p>

<p>Author: Shingo Takamatsu ; Issei Sato ; Hiroshi Nakagawa</p><p>Abstract: In relation extraction, distant supervision seeks to extract relations between entities from text by using a knowledge base, such as Freebase, as a source of supervision. When a sentence and a knowledge base refer to the same entity pair, this approach heuristically labels the sentence with the corresponding relation in the knowledge base. However, this heuristic can fail with the result that some sentences are labeled wrongly. This noisy labeled data causes poor extraction performance. In this paper, we propose a method to reduce the number of wrong labels. We present a novel generative model that directly models the heuristic labeling process of distant supervision. The model predicts whether assigned labels are correct or wrong via its hidden variables. Our experimental results show that this model detected wrong labels with higher performance than baseline methods. In the ex- periment, we also found that our wrong label reduction boosted the performance of relation extraction.</p><p>2 0.96797049 <a title="163-lda-2" href="./acl-2012-Fully_Abstractive_Approach_to_Guided_Summarization.html">101 acl-2012-Fully Abstractive Approach to Guided Summarization</a></p>

<p>Author: Claire Gardent ; Shashi Narayan</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, error mining approaches were developed to help identify the most likely sources of parsing failures in parsing systems using handcrafted grammars and lexicons. However the techniques they use to enumerate and count n-grams builds on the sequential nature of a text corpus and do not easily extend to structured data. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for mining trees and apply it to detect the most likely sources of generation failure. We show that this tree mining algorithm permits identifying not only errors in the generation system (grammar, lexicon) but also mismatches between the structures contained in the input and the input structures expected by our generator as well as a few idiosyncrasies/error in the input data.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.94186652 <a title="163-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Prediction_of_Learning_Curves_in_Machine_Translation.html">163 acl-2012-Prediction of Learning Curves in Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: S.R.K. Branavan ; Nate Kushman ; Tao Lei ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: Comprehending action preconditions and effects is an essential step in modeling the dynamics of the world. In this paper, we express the semantics of precondition relations extracted from text in terms of planning operations. The challenge of modeling this connection is to ground language at the level of relations. This type of grounding enables us to create high-level plans based on language abstractions. Our model jointly learns to predict precondition relations from text and to perform high-level planning guided by those relations. We implement this idea in the reinforcement learning framework using feedback automatically obtained from plan execution attempts. When applied to a complex virtual world and text describing that world, our relation extraction technique performs on par with a supervised baseline, yielding an F-measure of 66% compared to the baseline’s 65%. Additionally, we show that a high-level planner utilizing these extracted relations significantly outperforms a strong, text unaware baseline successfully completing 80% of planning tasks as compared to 69% for the baseline.1 –</p><p>6 0.87073177 <a title="163-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-WizIE%3A_A_Best_Practices_Guided_Development_Environment_for_Information_Extraction.html">215 acl-2012-WizIE: A Best Practices Guided Development Environment for Information Extraction</a></p>

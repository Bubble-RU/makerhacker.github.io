<p>Author: Oleksandr Kolomiyets ; Steven Bethard ; Marie-Francine Moens</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach to characterizing the timeline of a text: temporal dependency structures, where all the events of a narrative are linked via partial ordering relations like BEFORE, AFTER, OVERLAP and IDENTITY. We annotate a corpus of children’s stories with temporal dependency trees, achieving agreement (Krippendorff’s Alpha) of 0.856 on the event words, 0.822 on the links between events, and of 0.700 on the ordering relation labels. We compare two parsing models for temporal dependency structures, and show that a deterministic non-projective dependency parser outperforms a graph-based maximum spanning tree parser, achieving labeled attachment accuracy of 0.647 and labeled tree edit distance of 0.596. Our analysis of the dependency parser errors gives some insights into future research directions.</p><p>3 0.13752808 <a title="85-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Temporally_Anchored_Relation_Extraction.html">191 acl-2012-Temporally Anchored Relation Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Guillermo Garrido ; Anselmo Penas ; Bernardo Cabaleiro ; Alvaro Rodrigo</p><p>Abstract: Although much work on relation extraction has aimed at obtaining static facts, many of the target relations are actually fluents, as their validity is naturally anchored to a certain time period. This paper proposes a methodological approach to temporally anchored relation extraction. Our proposal performs distant supervised learning to extract a set of relations from a natural language corpus, and anchors each of them to an interval of temporal validity, aggregating evidence from documents supporting the relation. We use a rich graphbased document-level representation to generate novel features for this task. Results show that our implementation for temporal anchoring is able to achieve a 69% of the upper bound performance imposed by the relation extraction step. Compared to the state of the art, the overall system achieves the highest precision reported.</p><p>4 0.13458441 <a title="85-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Multilingual_Named_Entity_Recognition_using_Parallel_Data_and_Metadata_from_Wikipedia.html">150 acl-2012-Multilingual Named Entity Recognition using Parallel Data and Metadata from Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>Author: Sungchul Kim ; Kristina Toutanova ; Hwanjo Yu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a method to automatically label multi-lingual data with named entity tags. We build on prior work utilizing Wikipedia metadata and show how to effectively combine the weak annotations stemming from Wikipedia metadata with information obtained through English-foreign language parallel Wikipedia sentences. The combination is achieved using a novel semi-CRF model for foreign sentence tagging in the context of a parallel English sentence. The model outperforms both standard annotation projection methods and methods based solely on Wikipedia metadata.</p><p>5 0.12756266 <a title="85-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Finding_Salient_Dates_for_Building_Thematic_Timelines.html">99 acl-2012-Finding Salient Dates for Building Thematic Timelines</a></p>

In order to extract salient dates that warrant inclusion in an event timeline, we first recognize and normalize temporal expressions in texts and then use a machine-learning approach to extract salient dates that relate to a particular topic.

<p>Author: Katja Markert ; Yufang Hou ; Michael Strube</p><p>Abstract: Previous work on classifying information status (Nissim, 2006; Rahman and Ng, 2011) is restricted to coarse-grained classification and focuses on conversational dialogue. We here introduce the task of classifying finegrained information status and work on written text. We add a fine-grained information status layer to the Wall Street Journal portion of the OntoNotes corpus. We claim that the information status of a mention depends not only on the mention itself but also on other mentions in the vicinity and solve the task by collectively classifying the information status ofall mentions. Our approach strongly outperforms reimplementations of previous work.</p><p>3 0.63934755 <a title="85-lsi-3" href="./acl-2012-Finding_Salient_Dates_for_Building_Thematic_Timelines.html">99 acl-2012-Finding Salient Dates for Building Thematic Timelines</a></p>

We additionally introduce extensions to cover lexical relationships, frame-semantic knowledge, and language data.

<p>Author: Eric Xing</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic topic models have recently gained much popularity in informational retrieval and related areas. Via such models, one can project high-dimensional objects such as text documents into a low dimensional space where their latent semantics are captured and modeled; can integrate multiple sources of information—to ”share statistical strength” among components of a hierarchical probabilistic model; and can structurally display and classify the otherwise unstructured object collections. However, to many practitioners, how topic models work, what to and not to expect from a topic model, how is it different from and related to classical matrix algebraic techniques such as LSI, NMF in NLP, how to empower topic models to deal with complex scenarios such as multimodal data, contractual text in social media, evolving corpus, or presence of supervision such as labeling and rating, how to make topic modeling computationally tractable even on webscale data, etc., in a principled way, remain unclear. In this tutorial, I will demystify the conceptual, mathematical, and computational issues behind all such problems surrounding the topic models and their applications by presenting a systematic overview of the mathematical foundation of topic modeling, and its connections to a number of related methods popular in other fields such as the LDA, admixture model, mixed membership model, latent space models, and sparse coding. Iwill offer a simple and unifying view of all these techniques under the framework multi-view latent space embedding, and online the roadmap of model extension and algorithmic design to3 ward different applications in IR and NLP. A main theme of this tutorial that tie together a wide range of issues and problems will build on the ”probabilistic graphical model” formalism, a formalism that exploits the conjoined talents of graph theory and probability theory to build complex models out of simpler pieces. Iwill use this formalism as a main aid to discuss both the mathematical underpinnings for the models and the related computational issues in a unified, simplistic, transparent, and actionable fashion.

<p>Author: Ivan Titov ; Alexandre Klementiev</p><p>Abstract: We argue that multilingual parallel data provides a valuable source of indirect supervision for induction of shallow semantic representations. Specifically, we consider unsupervised induction of semantic roles from sentences annotated with automatically-predicted syntactic dependency representations and use a stateof-the-art generative Bayesian non-parametric model. At inference time, instead of only seeking the model which explains the monolingual data available for each language, we regularize the objective by introducing a soft constraint penalizing for disagreement in argument labeling on aligned sentences. We propose a simple approximate learning algorithm for our set-up which results in efficient inference. When applied to German-English parallel data, our method obtains a substantial improvement over a model trained without using the agreement signal, when both are tested on non-parallel sentences.</p><p>5 0.46849778 <a title="85-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Social_Event_Radar%3A_A_Bilingual_Context_Mining_and_Sentiment_Analysis_Summarization_System.html">180 acl-2012-Social Event Radar: A Bilingual Context Mining and Sentiment Analysis Summarization System</a></p>
<p>Author: Wen-Tai Hsieh ; Chen-Ming Wu ; Tsun Ku ; Seng-cho T. Chou</p><p>Abstract: Social Event Radar is a new social networking-based service platform, that aim to alert as well as monitor any merchandise flaws, food-safety related issues, unexpected eruption of diseases or campaign issues towards to the Government, enterprises of any kind or election parties, through keyword expansion detection module, using bilingual sentiment opinion analysis tool kit to conclude the specific event social dashboard and deliver the outcome helping authorities to plan “risk control” strategy. With the rapid development of social network, people can now easily publish their opinions on the Internet.

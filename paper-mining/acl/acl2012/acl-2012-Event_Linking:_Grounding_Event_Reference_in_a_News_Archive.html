</p><p>4 This implicitly relaxes coreference to co-reporting, and will practically enable augmenting news archives with semantic hyperlinks. [sent-8, score-0.256]
</p><p>5 We annotate and analyse a corpus of 150 documents, extracting 501 links to a news archive with reasonable inter-annotator agreement. [sent-9, score-0.404]
</p><p>6 1 Introduction  Interpreting news requires identifying its constituent events. [sent-10, score-0.179]
</p><p>7 Information extraction (IE) makes this feasible by considering only events of a specified type, such as personnel succession or arrest (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996; LDC, 2005), an approach not extensible to novel events, or the same event types in sub-domains, e. [sent-11, score-0.885]
</p><p>8 On the other hand, topic detection and tracking (TDT; Allan, 2002) disregards individual event mentions, clustering together articles that share a topic. [sent-14, score-0.744]
</p><p>9 Between these fine and coarse-grained approaches, event identification requires grouping references to the same event. [sent-15, score-0.643]
</p><p>10 However, strict coreference is hampered by the complexity of event semantics: poison, murder and die may indicate the same effective event. [sent-16, score-0.783]
</p><p>11 The solution is to tag mentions with a canonical identifier for each news-triggering event. [sent-17, score-0.126]
</p><p>12 This paper introduces event linking: given a past event reference in context, find the article in a news archive that first reports that the event happened. [sent-18, score-2.614]

</p><p>14 com  The task has an immediate practical application: some online newspapers link past event mentions to relevant news stories, but currently do so with low coverage and consistency; an event linker can add referentially-precise hyperlinks to news. [sent-22, score-1.773]
</p><p>15 The event linking task parallels entity linking (NEL; Ji and Grishman, 2011), considering a news archive as a knowledge base (KB) of events, where each article exclusively represents the zero or more events that it first reports. [sent-23, score-1.865]
</p><p>16 Coupled with an appropriate event extractor, event linking may be performed for all events mentioned in a document, like the named entity disambiguation task (Bunescu and Pa¸ sca, 2006; Cucerzan, 2007). [sent-24, score-1.751]
</p><p>17 We have annotated and analysed 150 news and opinion articles, marking references to past, newsworthy events, and linking where possible to canonical articles in a 13-year news archive. [sent-25, score-0.855]
</p><p>18 2  The events in a news story  Approaches to news event processing are subsumed within broader notions of topics, scenario templates, or temporal entities, among others. [sent-26, score-1.469]
</p><p>19 We illustrate key challenges in processing news events and motivate event linking through the example story in Figure 1. [sent-27, score-1.385]
</p><p>20 Salience Our story highlights carjackings and a police warning as newsworthy, alongside events like feeding, drove and told which carry less individual weight. [sent-28, score-0.653]
</p><p>21 Orthogonally, parts of the story are new events, while others are previously reported events that the reader may be aware of (illustrated in Figure 1). [sent-29, score-0.342]
</p><p>22 Online, the two background carjackings and the police warning are hyperlinked to other SMH articles where they were reported. [sent-30, score-0.273]

</p><p>27 Similarly, reference to a previously-reported event implies it is newsworthy. [sent-38, score-0.706]
</p><p>28 Diversity IE traditionally targets a selected event type (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996). [sent-39, score-0.695]
</p><p>29 ACE05 considers a broader event typology, dividing eight thematic event types (business, justice, etc. [sent-40, score-1.33]
</p><p>30 ) into 33 subtypes such as attack, die and declare bankruptcy (LDC, 2005). [sent-41, score-0.1]
</p><p>31 Most subtypes suffer from few annotated instances, while others are impractically broad: sexual abuse, gunfire and the Holocaust each constitute attack instances (is told considered an attack in Figure 1? [sent-42, score-0.214]
</p><p>32 1 While ACE05 would mark the various attack events in our story, police warned would be unrecognised. [sent-45, score-0.375]

</p><p>35 When considering the relationship between another carjacking and grabbed, drove or stabbed, ACE05 would apply the policy: “When in doubt, do not mark any coreference” (LDC, 2005). [sent-64, score-0.099]
</p><p>36 Bejan and Harabagiu (2008) consider event coreference across documents, marking the “most important events” (Bejan, 2010), albeit within Google News clusters, where multiple articles reporting the same event are likely to use similar language. [sent-65, score-1.496]
</p><p>37 Similar challenges apply to identifying event causality and other relations: Bejan and Harabagiu (2008) suggest arcs such as feeding −p −re −c −ed →es walking −en −a −b →les grabbed – akin to instantiat−i −o −ns − → →of FrameNe−−t ’s − →frame relations (Fillmore et al. [sent-66, score-0.829]
</p><p>38 Explicit reference By considering events through topical document clusters, TDT avoids some challenges of precise identity. [sent-69, score-0.399]
</p><p>39 It prescribes rules of interpretation for which stories pertain to a seminal  event. [sent-70, score-0.074]
</p><p>40 However, the carjackings in our story are neither preconditions nor consequences of a seminal event and so would not constitute a TDT cluster. [sent-71, score-0.864]
</p><p>41 TDT fails to account for these explicit event references. [sent-72, score-0.703]
</p><p>42 (2009) consider event dependency as directed arcs between documents or paragraphs, they generally retain a broad sense of topic with little attention to explicit reference. [sent-74, score-0.734]
</p><p>43 3  The event linking task  Given an explicit reference to a past event, event linking grounds it in a given news archive. [sent-75, score-2.013]
</p><p>44 This applies to all events worthy of having been reported, and harnesses explicit reference rather than more general notions of relevance. [sent-76, score-0.402]
</p><p>45 Though analogous to NEL, our task differs in the types of expressions that may be linked, and the manner of determining the correct KB node to link to, if any. [sent-77, score-0.161]
</p><p>46 1 Event-referring expressions We consider a subset of newsworthy events things that happen and directly trigger news as candidate referents. [sent-79, score-0.611]
</p><p>47 In TimeML’s event classification (Puste–  –  jovsky et al. [sent-80, score-0.643]

</p><p>52 2  A news archive as a KB  We define a canonical link target for each event: the earliest article in the archive that reports the given event happened or is happening. [sent-100, score-1.626]
</p><p>53 Each archival article implicitly represents zero or more related events, just as Wikipedia entries represent zero or one entity  in NEL. [sent-101, score-0.258]
</p><p>54 Links target the story as a whole: closely related, co-reported events link to the same article, avoiding a problematically strict approach to event identity. [sent-102, score-1.147]
</p><p>55 An archive reports only selected events, so a valid target may not exist (NEL’s NIL). [sent-103, score-0.271]
</p><p>56 4  An annotated corpus  We link to a digital archive of the Sydney Morning Herald: Australian and international news from 1986 to 2009, published daily, Monday to Saturday. [sent-104, score-0.501]
</p><p>57 2 We annotate a randomly sampled corpus of 150 articles from its 2009 News and Features and Business sections including news reports, op-eds and letters. [sent-105, score-0.233]
</p><p>58 For this whole-document annotation, a single word of each past/ongoing, newsworthy event mention is marked. [sent-106, score-0.843]
</p><p>59 3 If LINKABLE, the annotator searches the archive by keyword and date, selecting a target, reported here (a self-referential link) or NIL. [sent-107, score-0.243]
</p><p>60 An annotation ofour example story (Figure 1) would produce five groups of event references (Table 1). [sent-108, score-0.771]
</p><p>61 2The archive may be searched at http : / / news store . [sent-109, score-0.372]
</p><p>62 ac 3We couple marking and linking since annotators must learn to judge newsworthiness relative to the target archive. [sent-113, score-0.358]
</p><p>63 Pairwise inter-annotator agreement in Table 2 shows that annotators infrequently select the same words to link, but that reasonable agreement on the link target can be achieved for agreed tokens. [sent-115, score-0.308]
</p><p>64 4 Adjudicator-annotator agreements are generally much higher than inter-annotator agreements: in many cases, an annotator fails to find a target or selects one that does not first report the event; J accepts most annotations as valid. [sent-116, score-0.122]
</p><p>65 In other cases, there may be multiple articles published on the same day that describe the event in question from different angles; agreement increases substantially when relaxed to accept date agreement. [sent-117, score-0.736]
</p><p>66 Our adjudicated corpus of 150 documents is summarised in Table 3. [sent-118, score-0.053]
</p><p>67 Where a definitive link target is not available, an annotator may erroneously select another candidate: an opinion article describing the event, an article where the event is mentioned as background, or an article anticipating the event. [sent-119, score-1.341]

</p><p>72 For the application of adding hyperlinks to news, such a link might be beneficial, but it may be better considered an AGGREGATE. [sent-125, score-0.188]
</p><p>73 The schema underspecifies definitions of ‘event’ and ‘newsworthiness’, accounting for much of the token-level disagreement, but not directly affecting  the task of linking a specified mention to the archive. [sent-126, score-0.233]
</p><p>74 Adjectival mentions such as Apple’s new CEO are easy to miss and questionably explicit. [sent-127, score-0.077]
</p><p>75 Events are also confused with facts and abstract entities, such as bans, plans, reports and laws. [sent-128, score-0.045]
</p><p>76 Unlike many other facts, events can be grounded to a particular time of occurrence, often stated in text. [sent-129, score-0.242]
</p><p>77 5  Analysis and discussion  To assess task feasibility, we present bag-of-words (BoW) and oracle results (Figure 2). [sent-130, score-0.034]
</p><p>78 Using the whole document as a query5 retrieves 30% of gold targets at rank 10, but only 60% by rank 150. [sent-131, score-0.088]
</p><p>79 Term windows around each event mention perform close to our oracle consisting of successful search keywords collected during annotation, with over 80% recall at 150. [sent-132, score-0.754]
</p><p>80 No system recalls over 30% of targets at 1-best, suggesting a reranking approach may be required. [sent-133, score-0.052]
</p><p>81 These constraints may draw on temporal expressions in the source article or external knowledge. [sent-135, score-0.239]
</p><p>82 Successful automated linking will therefore require extensive use of semantic and temporal information. [sent-136, score-0.236]

</p><p>85 (2009) makes the reasonable assumption that news events generally build on others that recently precede them. [sent-140, score-0.492]
</p><p>86 We find that the likelihood  a linked article occurred fewer than d days ago reduces exponentially with respect to d, yet the rate of decay is surprisingly slow: half of all link targets precede their source by over 3 months. [sent-141, score-0.43]
</p><p>87 The effect of coreporting rather than coreference is also clear: like {carjacking, grabbed} in our example, mention chains include { return, decide, recontest}, {winner, Cup} as well as more familiar instances like {acquired, acquisition }. [sent-142, score-0.119]
</p><p>88 6  Conclusion  We have introduced event linking, which takes a novel approach to news event reference, associating each newsworthy past event with a canonical article in a news archive. [sent-143, score-2.699]
</p><p>89 We demonstrate task’s feasibility, with reasonable inter-annotator agreement over a 150 document corpus. [sent-144, score-0.107]

<p>Author: Wei Lu ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel sequence labeling model based on the latent-variable semiMarkov conditional random fields for jointly extracting argument roles of events from texts. The model takes in coarse mention and type information and predicts argument roles for a given event template. This paper addresses the event extraction problem in a primarily unsupervised setting, where no labeled training instances are available. Our key contribution is a novel learning framework called structured preference modeling (PM), that allows arbitrary preference to be assigned to certain structures during the learning procedure. We establish and discuss connections between this framework and other existing works. We show empirically that the structured preferences are crucial to the success of our task. Our model, trained without annotated data and with a small number of structured preferences, yields performance competitive to some baseline supervised approaches.</p><p>3 0.26063067 <a title="85-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Extracting_Narrative_Timelines_as_Temporal_Dependency_Structures.html">90 acl-2012-Extracting Narrative Timelines as Temporal Dependency Structures</a></p>
<p>Author: Oleksandr Kolomiyets ; Steven Bethard ; Marie-Francine Moens</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach to characterizing the timeline of a text: temporal dependency structures, where all the events of a narrative are linked via partial ordering relations like BEFORE, AFTER, OVERLAP and IDENTITY. We annotate a corpus of children’s stories with temporal dependency trees, achieving agreement (Krippendorff’s Alpha) of 0.856 on the event words, 0.822 on the links between events, and of 0.700 on the ordering relation labels. We compare two parsing models for temporal dependency structures, and show that a deterministic non-projective dependency parser outperforms a graph-based maximum spanning tree parser, achieving labeled attachment accuracy of 0.647 and labeled tree edit distance of 0.596. Our analysis of the dependency parser errors gives some insights into future research directions.</p><p>4 0.25880858 <a title="85-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-A_Novel_Burst-based_Text_Representation_Model_for_Scalable_Event_Detection.html">17 acl-2012-A Novel Burst-based Text Representation Model for Scalable Event Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xin Zhao ; Rishan Chen ; Kai Fan ; Hongfei Yan ; Xiaoming Li</p><p>Abstract: Mining retrospective events from text streams has been an important research topic. Classic text representation model (i.e., vector space model) cannot model temporal aspects of documents. To address it, we proposed a novel burst-based text representation model, denoted as BurstVSM. BurstVSM corresponds dimensions to bursty features instead of terms, which can capture semantic and temporal information. Meanwhile, it significantly reduces the number of non-zero entries in the representation. We test it via scalable event detection, and experiments in a 10-year news archive show that our methods are both effective and efficient.</p><p>5 0.23753364 <a title="85-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Towards_the_Unsupervised_Acquisition_of_Discourse_Relations.html">201 acl-2012-Towards the Unsupervised Acquisition of Discourse Relations</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian Chiarcos</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a novel approach towards the empirical approximation of discourse relations between different utterances in texts. Following the idea that every pair of events comes with preferences regarding the range and frequency of discourse relations connecting both parts, the paper investigates whether these preferences are manifested in the distribution of relation words (that serve to signal these relations). Experiments on two large-scale English web corpora show that significant correlations between pairs of adjacent events and relation words exist, that they are reproducible on different data sets, and for three relation words, that their distribution corresponds to theorybased assumptions. 1 Motivation Texts are not merely accumulations of isolated utterances, but the arrangement of utterances conveys meaning; human text understanding can thus be described as a process to recover the global structure of texts and the relations linking its different parts (Vallduv ı´ 1992; Gernsbacher et al. 2004). To capture these aspects of meaning in NLP, it is necessary to develop operationalizable theories, and, within a supervised approach, large amounts of annotated training data. To facilitate manual annotation, weakly supervised or unsupervised techniques can be applied as preprocessing step for semimanual annotation, and this is part of the motivation of the approach described here. 213 Discourse relations involve different aspects of meaning. This may include factual knowledge about the connected discourse segments (a ‘subjectmatter’ relation, e.g., if one utterance represents the cause for another, Mann and Thompson 1988, p.257), argumentative purposes (a ‘presentational’ relation, e.g., one utterance motivates the reader to accept a claim formulated in another utterance, ibid., p.257), or relations between entities mentioned in the connected discourse segments (anaphoric relations, Webber et al. 2003). Discourse relations can be indicated explicitly by optional cues, e.g., adverbials (e.g., however), conjunctions (e.g., but), or complex phrases (e.g., in contrast to what Peter said a minute ago). Here, these cues are referred to as relation words. Assuming that relation words are associated with specific discourse relations (Knott and Dale 1994; Prasad et al. 2008), the distribution of relation words found between two (types of) events can yield insights into the range of discourse relations possible at this occasion and their respective likeliness. For this purpose, this paper proposes a background knowledge base (BKB) that hosts pairs of events (here heuristically represented by verbs) along with distributional profiles for relation words. The primary data structure of the BKB is a triple where one event (type) is connected with a particular relation word to another event (type). Triples are further augmented with a frequency score (expressing the likelihood of the triple to be observed), a significance score (see below), and a correlation score (indicating whether a pair of events has a positive or negative correlation with a particular relation word). ProceedJienjgus, R ofep thueb 5lic0t hof A Knonrueaa,l M 8-e1e4ti Jnugly o f2 t0h1e2 A.s ?c so2c0ia1t2io Ans fsoorc Ciatoiomnp fuotart Cioonmaplu Ltiantgiounisatlic Lsi,n pgaugiestsi2c 1s3–217, Triples can be easily acquired from automatically parsed corpora. While the relation word is usually part of the utterance that represents the source of the relation, determining the appropriate target (antecedent) of the relation may be difficult to achieve. As a heuristic, an adjacency preference is adopted, i.e., the target is identified with the main event of the preceding utterance.1 The BKB can be constructed from a sufficiently large corpus as follows: • • identify event types and relation words for every utterance create a candidate triple consisting of the event type of the utterance, the relation word, and the event type of the preceding utterance. add the candidate triple to the BKB, if it found in the BKB, increase its score by (or initialize it with) 1, – – • perform a pruning on all candidate triples, calcpuerlaftoer significance aonnd a lclo crarneldaitdioante scores Pruning uses statistical significance tests to evaluate whether the relative frequency of a relation word for a pair of events is significantly higher or lower than the relative frequency of the relation word in the entire corpus. Assuming that incorrect candidate triples (i.e., where the factual target of the relation was non-adjacent) are equally distributed, they should be filtered out by the significance tests. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the validity of this approach. 2 Experimental Setup By generalizing over multiple occurrences of the same events (or, more precisely, event types), one can identify preferences of event pairs for one or several relation words. These preferences capture context-invariant characteristics of pairs of events and are thus to considered to reflect a semantic predisposition for a particular discourse relation. Formally, an event is the semantic representation of the meaning conveyed in the utterance. We 1Relations between non-adjacent utterances are constrained by the structure of discourse (Webber 1991), and thus less likely than relations between adjacent utterances. 214 assume that the same event can reoccur in different contexts, we are thus studying relations between types of events. For the experiment described here, events are heuristically identified with the main predicates of a sentence, i.e., non-auxiliar, noncausative, non-modal verbal lexemes that serve as heads of main clauses. The primary data structure of the approach described here is a triple consisting of a source event, a relation word and a target (antecedent) event. These triples are harvested from large syntactically annotated corpora. For intersentential relations, the target is identified with the event of the immediately preceding main clause. These extraction preferences are heuristic approximations, and thus, an additional pruning step is necessary. For this purpose, statistical significance tests are adopted (χ2 for triples of frequent events and relation words, t-test for rare events and/or relation words) that compare the relative frequency of a rela- tion word given a pair of events with the relative frequency of the relation word in the entire corpus. All results with p ≥ .05 are excluded, i.e., only triples are preserved pfo ≥r w .0h5ic ahr teh eex xocblsuedrevde,d i positive or negative correlation between a pair of events and a relation word is not due to chance with at least 95% probability. Assuming an even distribution of incorrect target events, this should rule these out. Additionally, it also serves as a means of evaluation. Using statistical significance tests as pruning criterion entails that all triples eventually confirmed are statistically significant.2 This setup requires immense amounts of data: We are dealing with several thousand events (theoretically, the total number of verbs of a language). The chance probability for two events to occur in adjacent position is thus far below 10−6, and it decreases further if the likelihood of a relation word is taken into consideration. All things being equal, we thus need millions of sentences to create the BKB. Here, two large-scale corpora of English are employed, PukWaC and Wackypedia EN (Baroni et al. 2009). PukWaC is a 2G-token web corpus of British English crawled from the uk domain (Ferraresi et al. 2Subsequent studies may employ less rigid pruning criteria. For the purpose of the current paper, however, the statistical significance of all extracted triples serves as an criterion to evaluate methodological validity. 2008), and parsed with MaltParser (Nivre et al. 2006). It is distributed in 5 parts; Only PukWaC1 to PukWaC-4 were considered here, constituting 82.2% (72.5M sentences) of the entire corpus, PukWaC-5 is left untouched for forthcoming evaluation experiments. Wackypedia EN is a 0.8G-token dump of the English Wikipedia, annotated with the same tools. It is distributed in 4 different files; the last portion was left untouched for forthcoming evaluation experiments. The portion analyzed here comprises 33.2M sentences, 75.9% of the corpus. The extraction of events in these corpora uses simple patterns that combine dependency information and part-of-speech tags to retrieve the main verbs and store their lemmata as event types. The target (antecedent) event was identified with the last main event of the preceding sentence. As relation words, only sentence-initial children of the source event that were annotated as adverbial modifiers, verb modifiers or conjunctions were considered. 3 Evaluation To evaluate the validity of the approach, three fundamental questions need to be addressed: significance (are there significant correlations between pairs of events and relation words ?), reproducibility (can these correlations confirmed on independent data sets ?), and interpretability (can these correlations be interpreted in terms of theoretically-defined discourse relations ?). 3.1 Significance and Reproducibility Significance tests are part of the pruning stage of the algorithm. Therefore, the number of triples eventually retrieved confirms the existence of statistically significant correlations between pairs of events and relation words. The left column of Tab. 1 shows the number of triples obtained from PukWaC subcorpora of different size. For reproducibility, compare the triples identified with Wackypedia EN and PukWaC subcorpora of different size: Table 1 shows the number of triples found in both Wackypedia EN and PukWaC, and the agreement between both resources. For two triples involving the same events (event types) and the same relation word, agreement means that the relation word shows either positive or negative correlation 215 TasPbe13u7l4n2k98t.

Table 1 confirms that results obtained on one resource can be reproduced on another. This indicates that triples indeed capture context-invariant, and hence, semantic, characteristics of the relation between events. The data also indicates that reproducibility increases with the size of corpora from which a BKB is built. 3.2 Interpretability Any theory of discourse relations would predict that relation words with similar function should have similar distributions, whereas one would expect different distributions for functionally unrelated relation words. These expectations are tested here for three of the most frequent relation words found in the corpora, i.e., but, then and however. But and however can be grouped together under a generalized notion of contrast (Knott and Dale 1994; Prasad et al. 2008); then, on the other hand, indicates a tem- poral and/or causal relation. Table 2 confirms the expectation that event pairs that are correlated with but tend to show the same correlation with however, but not with then. 4 Discussion and Outlook This paper described a novel approach towards the unsupervised acquisition of discourse relations, with encouraging preliminary results: Large collections of parsed text are used to assess distributional profiles of relation words that indicate discourse relations that are possible between specific types of events; on this basis, a background knowledge base (BKB) was created that can be used to predict an appropriatediscoursemarkertoconnecttwoutterances with no overt relation word. This information can be used, for example, to facilitate the semiautomated annotation of discourse relations, by pointing out the ‘default’ relation word for a given pair of events. Similarly, Zhou et al. (2010) used a language model to predict discourse markers for implicitly realized discourse relations. As opposed to this shallow, n-gram-based approach, here, the internal structure of utterances is exploited: based on semantic considerations, syntactic patterns have been devised that extract triples of event pairs and relation words. The resulting BKB provides a distributional approximation of the discourse relations that can hold between two specific event types. Both approaches exploit complementary sources of knowledge, and may be combined with each other to achieve a more precise prediction of implicit discourse connectives. The validity of the approach was evaluated with respect to three evaluation criteria: The extracted associations between relation words and event pairs could be shown to be statistically significant, and to be reproducible on other corpora; for three highly frequent relation words, theoretical predictions about their relative distribution could be confirmed, indicating their interpretability in terms of presupposed taxonomies of discourse relations. Another prospective field of application can be seen in NLP applications, where selection preferences for relation words may serve as a cheap replacement for full-fledged discourse parsing. In the Natural Language Understanding domain, the BKB may help to disambiguate or to identify discourse relations between different events; in the context of Machine Translation, it may represent a factor guid- ing the insertion of relation words, a task that has been found to be problematic for languages that dif216 fer in their inventory and usage of discourse markers, e.g., German and English (Stede and Schmitz 2000). The approach is language-independent (except for the syntactic extraction patterns), and it does not require manually annotated data. It would thus be easy to create background knowledge bases with relation words for other languages or specific domains given a sufficient amount of textual data. – Related research includes, for example, the unsupervised recognition of causal and temporal relationships, as required, for example, for the recognition of textual entailment. Riaz and Girju (2010) exploit distributional information about pairs of utterances. Unlike approach described here, they are not restricted to adjacent utterances, and do not rely on explicit and recurrent relation words. Their approach can thus be applied to comparably small data sets. However, they are restricted to a specific type of relations whereas here the entire band- width of discourse relations that are explicitly realized in a language are covered. Prospectively, both approaches could be combined to compensate their respective weaknesses. Similar observations can be made with respect to Chambers and Jurafsky (2009) and Kasch and Oates (2010), who also study a single discourse relation (narration), and are thus more limited in scope than the approach described here. However, as their approach extends beyond pairs of events to complex event chains, it seems that both approaches provide complementary types of information and their results could also be combined in a fruitful way to achieve a more detailed assessment of discourse relations. The goal of this paper was to evaluate the methdological validity of the approach. It thus represents the basis for further experiments, e.g., with respect to the enrichment the BKB with information provided by Riaz and Girju (2010), Chambers and Jurafsky (2009) and Kasch and Oates (2010). Other directions of subsequent research may include address more elaborate models of events, and the investigation of the relationship between relation words and taxonomies of discourse relations.

Events are complex linguistically and ontologically, so disambiguating their reference is challenging. We introduce event linking, which canonically labels an event reference with the article where it was first reported. This implicitly relaxes coreference to co-reporting, and will practically enable augmenting news archives with semantic hyperlinks. We annotate and analyse a corpus of 150 documents, extracting 501 links to a news archive with reasonable inter-annotator agreement.</p><p>2 0.69780076 <a title="85-lsi-2" href="./acl-2012-Automatic_Event_Extraction_with_Structured_Preference_Modeling.html">33 acl-2012-Automatic Event Extraction with Structured Preference Modeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Lu ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel sequence labeling model based on the latent-variable semiMarkov conditional random fields for jointly extracting argument roles of events from texts. The model takes in coarse mention and type information and predicts argument roles for a given event template. This paper addresses the event extraction problem in a primarily unsupervised setting, where no labeled training instances are available. Our key contribution is a novel learning framework called structured preference modeling (PM), that allows arbitrary preference to be assigned to certain structures during the learning procedure. We establish and discuss connections between this framework and other existing works. We show empirically that the structured preferences are crucial to the success of our task. Our model, trained without annotated data and with a small number of structured preferences, yields performance competitive to some baseline supervised approaches.</p><p>3 0.65549695 <a title="85-lsi-3" href="./acl-2012-A_Novel_Burst-based_Text_Representation_Model_for_Scalable_Event_Detection.html">17 acl-2012-A Novel Burst-based Text Representation Model for Scalable Event Detection</a></p>

Classic text representation model (i.e., vector space model) cannot model temporal aspects of documents. To address it, we proposed a novel burst-based text representation model, denoted as BurstVSM.

<p>Author: Preethi Raghavan ; Albert Lai ; Eric Fosler-Lussier</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of ordering medical events in unstructured clinical narratives by learning to rank them based on their time of occurrence. We represent each medical event as a time duration, with a corresponding start and stop, and learn to rank the starts/stops based on their proximity to the admission date. Such a representation allows us to learn all of Allen’s temporal relations between medical events. Interestingly, we observe that this methodology performs better than a classification-based approach for this domain, but worse on the relationships found in the Timebank corpus. This finding has important implications for styles of data representation and resources used for temporal relation learning: clinical narratives may have different language attributes corresponding to temporal ordering relative to Timebank, implying that the field may need to look at a wider range ofdomains to fully understand the nature of temporal ordering.</p><p>6 0.504794 <a title="85-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-Towards_the_Unsupervised_Acquisition_of_Discourse_Relations.html">201 acl-2012-Towards the Unsupervised Acquisition of Discourse Relations</a></p>

<p>Author: Joel Nothman ; Matthew Honnibal ; Ben Hachey ; James R. Curran</p><p>Abstract: Interpreting news requires identifying its constituent events. Events are complex linguistically and ontologically, so disambiguating their reference is challenging. We introduce event linking, which canonically labels an event reference with the article where it was first reported. This implicitly relaxes coreference to co-reporting, and will practically enable augmenting news archives with semantic hyperlinks. We annotate and analyse a corpus of 150 documents, extracting 501 links to a news archive with reasonable inter-annotator agreement.</p><p>2 0.82501709 <a title="85-lda-2" href="./acl-2012-Automated_Essay_Scoring_Based_on_Finite_State_Transducer%3A_towards_ASR_Transcription_of_Oral_English_Speech.html">32 acl-2012-Automated Essay Scoring Based on Finite State Transducer: towards ASR Transcription of Oral English Speech</a></p>
<p>Author: Xingyuan Peng ; Dengfeng Ke ; Bo Xu</p><p>Abstract: Conventional Automated Essay Scoring (AES) measures may cause severe problems when directly applied in scoring Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcription as they are error sensitive and unsuitable for the characteristic of ASR transcription. Therefore, we introduce a framework of Finite State Transducer (FST) to avoid the shortcomings. Compared with the Latent Semantic Analysis with Support Vector Regression (LSA-SVR) method (stands for the conventional measures), our FST method shows better performance especially towards the ASR transcription. In addition, we apply the synonyms similarity to expand the FST model. The final scoring performance reaches an acceptable level of 0.80 which is only 0.07 lower than the correlation (0.87) between human raters.</p><p>3 0.75804871 <a title="85-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Detecting_Semantic_Equivalence_and_Information_Disparity_in_Cross-lingual_Documents.html">72 acl-2012-Detecting Semantic Equivalence and Information Disparity in Cross-lingual Documents</a></p>
<p>Author: Yashar Mehdad ; Matteo Negri ; Marcello Federico</p><p>Abstract: We address a core aspect of the multilingual content synchronization task: the identification of novel, more informative or semantically equivalent pieces of information in two documents about the same topic. This can be seen as an application-oriented variant of textual entailment recognition where: i) T and H are in different languages, and ii) entailment relations between T and H have to be checked in both directions. Using a combination of lexical, syntactic, and semantic features to train a cross-lingual textual entailment system, we report promising results on different datasets.</p><p>4 0.63237113 <a title="85-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Multilingual_Named_Entity_Recognition_using_Parallel_Data_and_Metadata_from_Wikipedia.html">150 acl-2012-Multilingual Named Entity Recognition using Parallel Data and Metadata from Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>Author: Sungchul Kim ; Kristina Toutanova ; Hwanjo Yu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a method to automatically label multi-lingual data with named entity tags. We build on prior work utilizing Wikipedia metadata and show how to effectively combine the weak annotations stemming from Wikipedia metadata with information obtained through English-foreign language parallel Wikipedia sentences. The combination is achieved using a novel semi-CRF model for foreign sentence tagging in the context of a parallel English sentence. The model outperforms both standard annotation projection methods and methods based solely on Wikipedia metadata.</p><p>5 0.5827952 <a title="85-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Subgroup_Detection_in_Ideological_Discussions.html">187 acl-2012-Subgroup Detection in Ideological Discussions</a></p>
<p>Author: Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Pradeep Dasigi ; Mona Diab ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: The rapid and continuous growth of social networking sites has led to the emergence of many communities of communicating groups. Many of these groups discuss ideological and political topics. It is not uncommon that the participants in such discussions split into two or more subgroups. The members of each subgroup share the same opinion toward the discussion topic and are more likely to agree with members of the same subgroup and disagree with members from opposing subgroups. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach for automatically detecting discussant subgroups in online communities. We analyze the text exchanged between the participants of a discussion to identify the attitude they carry toward each other and towards the various aspects of the discussion topic. We use attitude predictions to construct an attitude vector for each discussant. We use clustering techniques to cluster these vectors and, hence, determine the subgroup membership of each participant. We compare our methods to text clustering and other baselines, and show that our method achieves promising results.</p><p>6 0.58065993 <a title="85-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-A_Graph-based_Cross-lingual_Projection_Approach_for_Weakly_Supervised_Relation_Extraction.html">12 acl-2012-A Graph-based Cross-lingual Projection Approach for Weakly Supervised Relation Extraction</a></p>

<p>Author: Einat Minkov ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a joint model for template filling, where the goal is to automatically specify the fields of target relations such as seminar announcements or corporate acquisition events. The approach models mention detection, unification and field extraction in a flexible, feature-rich model that allows for joint modeling of interdependencies at all levels and across fields. Such an approach can, for example, learn likely event durations and the fact that start times should come before end times. While the joint inference space is large, we demonstrate effective learning with a Perceptron-style approach that uses simple, greedy beam decoding.

<p>Author: Limin Yao ; Sebastian Riedel ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: To discover relation types from text, most methods cluster shallow or syntactic patterns of relation mentions, but consider only one possible sense per pattern. In practice this assumption is often violated. In this paper we overcome this issue by inducing clusters of pattern senses from feature representations of patterns. In particular, we employ a topic model to partition entity pairs associated with patterns into sense clusters using local and global features. We merge these sense clusters into semantic relations using hierarchical agglomerative clustering. We compare against several baselines: a generative latent-variable model, a clustering method that does not disambiguate between path senses, and our own approach but with only local features. Experimental results show our proposed approach discovers dramatically more accurate clusters than models without sense disambiguation, and that incorporating global features, such as the document theme, is crucial.</p><p>5 0.085500151 <a title="186-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Automatic_Event_Extraction_with_Structured_Preference_Modeling.html">33 acl-2012-Automatic Event Extraction with Structured Preference Modeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Lu ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel sequence labeling model based on the latent-variable semiMarkov conditional random fields for jointly extracting argument roles of events from texts. The model takes in coarse mention and type information and predicts argument roles for a given event template. This paper addresses the event extraction problem in a primarily unsupervised setting, where no labeled training instances are available. Our key contribution is a novel learning framework called structured preference modeling (PM), that allows arbitrary preference to be assigned to certain structures during the learning procedure. We establish and discuss connections between this framework and other existing works. We show empirically that the structured preferences are crucial to the success of our task. Our model, trained without annotated data and with a small number of structured preferences, yields performance competitive to some baseline supervised approaches.</p><p>6 0.081906274 <a title="186-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Pattern_Learning_for_Relation_Extraction_with_a_Hierarchical_Topic_Model.html">159 acl-2012-Pattern Learning for Relation Extraction with a Hierarchical Topic Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Igor Labutov ; Hod Lipson</p><p>Abstract: This work presents a first step to a general implementation of the Semantic-Script Theory of Humor (SSTH). Of the scarce amount of research in computational humor, no research had focused on humor generation beyond simple puns and punning riddles. We propose an algorithm for mining simple humorous scripts from a semantic network (ConceptNet) by specifically searching for dual scripts that jointly maximize overlap and incongruity metrics in line with Raskin’s Semantic-Script Theory of Humor. Initial results show that a more relaxed constraint of this form is capable of generating humor of deeper semantic content than wordplay riddles. We evaluate the said metrics through a user-assessed quality of the generated two-liners.</p><p>4 0.52581018 <a title="186-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-Discriminative_Learning_for_Joint_Template_Filling.html">73 acl-2012-Discriminative Learning for Joint Template Filling</a></p>

<p>Author: Alexandre Davis ; Adriano Veloso ; Altigran Soares ; Alberto Laender ; Wagner Meira Jr.</p><p>Abstract: The named entity disambiguation task is to resolve the many-to-many correspondence between ambiguous names and the unique realworld entity. This task can be modeled as a classification problem, provided that positive and negative examples are available for learning binary classifiers. High-quality senseannotated data, however, are hard to be obtained in streaming environments, since the training corpus would have to be constantly updated in order to accomodate the fresh data coming on the stream. On the other hand, few positive examples plus large amounts of unlabeled data may be easily acquired. Producing binary classifiers directly from this data, however, leads to poor disambiguation performance. Thus, we propose to enhance the quality of the classifiers using finer-grained variations of the well-known ExpectationMaximization (EM) algorithm. We conducted a systematic evaluation using Twitter streaming data and the results show that our classifiers are extremely effective, providing improvements ranging from 1% to 20%, when compared to the current state-of-the-art biased SVMs, being more than 120 times faster.</p><p>3 0.46081209 <a title="186-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Bootstrapping_a_Unified_Model_of_Lexical_and_Phonetic_Acquisition.html">41 acl-2012-Bootstrapping a Unified Model of Lexical and Phonetic Acquisition</a></p>
<p>Author: Micha Elsner ; Sharon Goldwater ; Jacob Eisenstein</p><p>Abstract: ILCC, School of Informatics School of Interactive Computing University of Edinburgh Georgia Institute of Technology Edinburgh, EH8 9AB, UK Atlanta, GA, 30308, USA (a) intended: /ju want w2n/ /want e kUki/ (b) surface: [j@ w a?P w2n] [wan @ kUki] During early language acquisition, infants must learn both a lexicon and a model of phonetics that explains how lexical items can vary in pronunciation—for instance “the” might be realized as [Di] or [D@]. Previous models of acquisition have generally tackled these problems in isolation, yet behavioral evidence suggests infants acquire lexical and phonetic knowledge simultaneously. We present a Bayesian model that clusters together phonetic variants of the same lexical item while learning both a language model over lexical items and a log-linear model of pronunciation variability based on articulatory features. The model is trained on transcribed surface pronunciations, and learns by bootstrapping, without access to the true lexicon. We test the model using a corpus of child-directed speech with realistic phonetic variation and either gold standard or automatically induced word boundaries. In both cases modeling variability improves the accuracy of the learned lexicon over a system that assumes each lexical item has a unique pronunciation.</p><p>4 0.46010613 <a title="186-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Bayesian_Symbol-Refined_Tree_Substitution_Grammars_for_Syntactic_Parsing.html">38 acl-2012-Bayesian Symbol-Refined Tree Substitution Grammars for Syntactic Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Hiroyuki Shindo ; Yusuke Miyao ; Akinori Fujino ; Masaaki Nagata</p><p>Abstract: We propose Symbol-Refined Tree Substitution Grammars (SR-TSGs) for syntactic parsing. An SR-TSG is an extension of the conventional TSG model where each nonterminal symbol can be refined (subcategorized) to fit the training data. We aim to provide a unified model where TSG rules and symbol refinement are learned from training data in a fully automatic and consistent fashion. We present a novel probabilistic SR-TSG model based on the hierarchical Pitman-Yor Process to encode backoff smoothing from a fine-grained SR-TSG to simpler CFG rules, and develop an efficient training method based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Our SR-TSG parser achieves an F1 score of 92.4% in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) English Penn Treebank parsing task, which is a 7.7 point improvement over a conventional Bayesian TSG parser, and better than state-of-the-art discriminative reranking parsers.</p><p>5 0.45928898 <a title="186-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Lemmatisation_as_a_Tagging_Task.html">137 acl-2012-Lemmatisation as a Tagging Task</a></p>

We formalise lemmatisation as a category tagging task, by describing how a word-to-lemma transformation rule can be encoded in a single label and how a set of such labels can be inferred for a specific language. In this way, a lemmatisation system can be trained and tested using any supervised tagging model. In contrast to previous approaches, the proposed technique allows us to easily integrate relevant contextual information. We test our approach on eight languages reaching a new state-of-the-art level for the lemmatisation task.</p><p>6 0.45838636 <a title="186-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Semi-supervised_Dependency_Parsing_using_Lexical_Affinities.html">175 acl-2012-Semi-supervised Dependency Parsing using Lexical Affinities</a></p>

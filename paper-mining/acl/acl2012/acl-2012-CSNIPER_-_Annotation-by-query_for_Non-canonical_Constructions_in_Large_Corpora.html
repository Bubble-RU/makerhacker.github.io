We jointly model the interplay between latent user intents that govern queries and unobserved entity types, leveraging observed signals from query formulations and document clicks.

<p>Author: Kuzman Ganchev ; Keith Hall ; Ryan McDonald ; Slav Petrov</p><p>Abstract: Syntactic analysis of search queries is important for a variety of information-retrieval tasks; however, the lack of annotated data makes training query analysis models difficult. We propose a simple, efficient procedure in which part-of-speech tags are transferred from retrieval-result snippets to queries at training time. Unlike previous work, our final model does not require any additional resources at run-time. Compared to a state-ofthe-art approach, we achieve more than 20% relative error reduction. Additionally, we annotate a corpus of search queries with partof-speech tags, providing a resource for future work on syntactic query analysis.</p><p>4 0.14340597 <a title="44-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Word_Sense_Disambiguation_Improves_Information_Retrieval.html">217 acl-2012-Word Sense Disambiguation Improves Information Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhi Zhong ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: Previous research has conflicting conclusions on whether word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems can improve information retrieval (IR) performance. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate sense distributions for short queries. Together with the senses predicted for words in documents, we propose a novel approach to incorporate word senses into the language modeling approach to IR and also exploit the integration of synonym relations. Our experimental results on standard TREC collections show that using the word senses tagged by a supervised WSD system, we obtain significant improvements over a state-of-the-art IR system.</p><p>5 0.12836957 <a title="44-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Assessing_the_Effect_of_Inconsistent_Assessors_on_Summarization_Evaluation.html">29 acl-2012-Assessing the Effect of Inconsistent Assessors on Summarization Evaluation</a></p>
<p>Author: Karolina Owczarzak ; Peter A. Rankel ; Hoa Trang Dang ; John M. Conroy</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the consistency of human assessors involved in summarization evaluation to understand its effect on system ranking and automatic evaluation techniques. Using Text Analysis Conference data, we measure annotator consistency based on human scoring of summaries for Responsiveness, Readability, and Pyramid scoring. We identify inconsistencies in the data and measure to what extent these inconsistencies affect the ranking of automatic summarization systems. Finally, we examine the stability of automatic metrics (ROUGE and CLASSY) with respect to the inconsistent assessments.</p><p>6 0.10086609 <a title="44-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Automatically_Mining_Question_Reformulation_Patterns_from_Search_Log_Data.html">35 acl-2012-Automatically Mining Question Reformulation Patterns from Search Log Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Toshikazu Tajiri ; Mamoru Komachi ; Yuji Matsumoto</p><p>Abstract: As the number of learners of English is constantly growing, automatic error correction of ESL learners’ writing is an increasingly active area of research. However, most research has mainly focused on errors concerning articles and prepositions even though tense/aspect errors are also important. One of the main reasons why tense/aspect error correction is difficult is that the choice of tense/aspect is highly dependent on global context. Previous research on grammatical error correction typically uses pointwise prediction that performs classification on each word independently, and thus fails to capture the information of neighboring labels. In order to take global information into account, we regard the task as sequence labeling: each verb phrase in a document is labeled with tense/aspect depending on surrounding labels. Our experiments show that the global context makes a moderate con- tribution to tense/aspect error correction.</p><p>3 0.46415308 <a title="44-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Efficient_Search_for_Transformation-based_Inference.html">78 acl-2012-Efficient Search for Transformation-based Inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Asher Stern ; Roni Stern ; Ido Dagan ; Ariel Felner</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the search problem in textual inference, where systems need to infer one piece of text from another. A prominent approach to this task is attempts to transform one text into the other through a sequence of inference-preserving transformations, a.k.a. a proof, while estimating the proof’s validity. This raises a search challenge of finding the best possible proof. We explore this challenge through a comprehensive investigation of prominent search algorithms and propose two novel algorithmic components specifically designed for textual inference: a gradient-style evaluation function, and a locallookahead node expansion method. Evaluations, using the open-source system, BIUTEE, show the contribution of these ideas to search efficiency and proof quality.</p><p>4 0.45231202 <a title="44-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Unsupervised_Relation_Discovery_with_Sense_Disambiguation.html">208 acl-2012-Unsupervised Relation Discovery with Sense Disambiguation</a></p>
<p>Author: Limin Yao ; Sebastian Riedel ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: To discover relation types from text, most methods cluster shallow or syntactic patterns of relation mentions, but consider only one possible sense per pattern. In practice this assumption is often violated. In this paper we overcome this issue by inducing clusters of pattern senses from feature representations of patterns. In particular, we employ a topic model to partition entity pairs associated with patterns into sense clusters using local and global features. We merge these sense clusters into semantic relations using hierarchical agglomerative clustering. We compare against several baselines: a generative latent-variable model, a clustering method that does not disambiguate between path senses, and our own approach but with only local features. Experimental results show our proposed approach discovers dramatically more accurate clusters than models without sense disambiguation, and that incorporating global features, such as the document theme, is crucial.</p><p>5 0.45181352 <a title="44-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Crowdsourcing_Inference-Rule_Evaluation.html">65 acl-2012-Crowdsourcing Inference-Rule Evaluation</a></p>
<p>Author: Naomi Zeichner ; Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: The importance of inference rules to semantic applications has long been recognized and extensive work has been carried out to automatically acquire inference-rule resources. However, evaluating such resources has turned out to be a non-trivial task, slowing progress in the field. In this paper, we suggest a framework for evaluating inference-rule resources. Our framework simplifies a previously proposed “instance-based evaluation” method that involved substantial annotator training, making it suitable for crowdsourcing. We show that our method produces a large amount of annotations with high inter-annotator agreement for a low cost at a short period of time, without requiring training expert annotators.</p><p>6 0.45062742 <a title="44-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-The_Creation_of_a_Corpus_of_English_Metalanguage.html">195 acl-2012-The Creation of a Corpus of English Metalanguage</a></p>

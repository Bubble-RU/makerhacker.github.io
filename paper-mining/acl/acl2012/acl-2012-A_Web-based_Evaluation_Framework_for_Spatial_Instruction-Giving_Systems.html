<p>Author: David Chen</p><p>Abstract: Learning a semantic lexicon is often an important first step in building a system that learns to interpret the meaning of natural language. It is especially important in language grounding where the training data usually consist of language paired with an ambiguous perceptual context. Recent work by Chen and Mooney (201 1) introduced a lexicon learning method that deals with ambiguous relational data by taking intersections of graphs. While the algorithm produced good lexicons for the task of learning to interpret navigation instructions, it only works in batch settings and does not scale well to large datasets. In this paper we introduce a new online algorithm that is an order of magnitude faster and surpasses the stateof-the-art results. We show that by changing the grammar of the formal meaning represen- . tation language and training on additional data collected from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk we can further improve the results. We also include experimental results on a Chinese translation of the training data to demonstrate the generality of our approach.</p><p>3 0.2644738 <a title="24-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Corpus-based_Interpretation_of_Instructions_in_Virtual_Environments.html">59 acl-2012-Corpus-based Interpretation of Instructions in Virtual Environments</a></p>
<p>Author: Luciana Benotti ; Martin Villalba ; Tessa Lau ; Julian Cerruti</p><p>Abstract: Previous approaches to instruction interpretation have required either extensive domain adaptation or manually annotated corpora. This paper presents a novel approach to instruction interpretation that leverages a large amount of unannotated, easy-to-collect data from humans interacting with a virtual world. We compare several algorithms for automatically segmenting and discretizing this data into (utterance, reaction) pairs and training a classifier to predict reactions given the next utterance. Our empirical analysis shows that the best algorithm achieves 70% accuracy on this task, with no manual annotation required. 1 Introduction and motivation Mapping instructions into automatically executable actions would enable the creation of natural lan- , guage interfaces to many applications (Lau et al., 2009; Branavan et al., 2009; Orkin and Roy, 2009). In this paper, we focus on the task of navigation and manipulation of a virtual environment (Vogel and Jurafsky, 2010; Chen and Mooney, 2011). Current symbolic approaches to the problem are brittle to the natural language variation present in instructions and require intensive rule authoring to be fit for a new task (Dzikovska et al., 2008). Current statistical approaches require extensive manual annotations of the corpora used for training (MacMahon et al., 2006; Matuszek et al., 2010; Gorniak and Roy, 2007; Rieser and Lemon, 2010). Manual annotation and rule authoring by natural language engineering experts are bottlenecks for developing conversational systems for new domains. 181 t e s s al au @ us . ibm . com, j ce rrut i ar .ibm . com @ This paper proposes a fully automated approach to interpreting natural language instructions to complete a task in a virtual world based on unsupervised recordings of human-human interactions perform- ing that task in that virtual world. Given unannotated corpora collected from humans following other humans’ instructions, our system automatically segments the corpus into labeled training data for a classification algorithm. Our interpretation algorithm is based on the observation that similar instructions uttered in similar contexts should lead to similar actions being taken in the virtual world. Given a previously unseen instruction, our system outputs actions that can be directly executed in the virtual world, based on what humans did when given similar instructions in the past. 2 Corpora situated in virtual worlds Our environment consists of six virtual worlds designed for the natural language generation shared task known as the GIVE Challenge (Koller et al., 2010), where a pair of partners must collaborate to solve a task in a 3D space (Figure 1). The “instruction follower” (IF) can move around in the virtual world, but has no knowledge of the task. The “instruction giver” (IG) types instructions to the IF in order to guide him to accomplish the task. Each corpus contains the IF’s actions and position recorded every 200 milliseconds, as well as the IG’s instruc- tions with their timestamps. We used two corpora for our experiments. The Cm corpus (Gargett et al., 2010) contains instructions given by multiple people, consisting of 37 games spanning 2163 instructions over 8: 17 hs.

The world consists of interconnecting hallways, rooms and objects Cs corpus (Benotti and Denis, 2011), gathered using a single IG, is composed of 63 games and 3417 in- structions, and was recorded in a span of 6:09 hs. It took less than 15 hours to collect the corpora through the web and the subjects reported that the experiment was fun. While the environment is restricted, people describe the same route and the same objects in extremely different ways. Below are some examples of instructions from our corpus all given for the same route shown in Figure 1. 1) out 2) walk down the passage 3) nowgo [sic] to the pink room 4) back to the room with the plant 5) Go through the door on the left 6) go through opening with yellow wall paper People describe routes using landmarks (4) or specific actions (2). They may describe the same object differently (5 vs 6). Instructions also differ in their scope (3 vs 1). Thus, even ignoring spelling and grammatical errors, navigation instructions contain considerable variation which makes interpreting them a challenging problem. 3 Learning from previous interpretations Our algorithm consists of two phases: annotation and interpretation. Annotation is performed only once and consists of automatically associating each IG instruction to an IF reaction. Interpretation is performed every time the system receives an instruc182 tion and consists of predicting an appropriate reaction given reactions observed in the corpus. Our method is based on the assumption that a reaction captures the semantics of the instruction that caused it. Therefore, if two utterances result in the same reaction, they are paraphrases of each other, and similar utterances should generate the same reaction. This approach enables us to predict reactions for previously-unseen instructions. 3.1 Annotation phase The key challenge in learning from massive amounts of easily-collected data is to automatically annotate an unannotated corpus. Our annotation method consists of two parts: first, segmenting a low-level interaction trace into utterances and corresponding reactions, and second, discretizing those reactions into canonical action sequences. Segmentation enables our algorithm to learn from traces of IFs interacting directly with a virtual world. Since the IF can move freely in the virtual world, his actions are a stream of continuous behavior. Segmentation divides these traces into reactions that follow from each utterance of the IG. Consider the following example starting at the situation shown in Figure 1: IG(1): go through the yellow opening IF(2): [walks out of the room] IF(3): [turns left at the intersection] IF(4): [enters the room with the sofa] IG(5): stop It is not clear whether the IF is doing h3, 4i because h neo tis c reacting htoe r1 t or Fbec isadu soei hge h 3is, being proactive. While one could manually annotate this data to remove extraneous actions, our goal is to develop automated solutions that enable learning from massive amounts of data. We decided to approach this problem by experimenting with two alternative formal definitions: 1) a strict definition that considers the maximum reaction according to the IF behavior, and 2) a loose defini- tion based on the empirical observation that, in situated interaction, most instructions are constrained by the current visually perceived affordances (Gibson, 1979; Stoia et al., 2006). We formally define behavior segmentation (Bhv) as follows. A reaction rk to an instruction uk begins right after the instruction uk is uttered and ends right before the next instruction uk+1 is uttered. In the example, instruction 1corresponds to h2, 3, 4i . We formally d inefsitnrue visibility segmentation (Vis) as f Wolelows. A reaction rk to an instruction uk begins right after the instruction uk is uttered and ends right before the next instruction uk+1 is uttered or right after the IF leaves the area visible at 360◦ from where uk was uttered. In the example, instruction 1’s reaction would be limited to h2i because the intersection is nwootu vldisi bbele l ifmroimte dw htoer he2 tihe b eicnasutrsuec ttihoen was suetctetiroend. The Bhv and Vis methods define how to segment an interaction trace into utterances and their corresponding reactions. However, users frequently perform noisy behavior that is irrelevant to the goal of the task. For example, after hearing an instruction, an IF might go into the wrong room, realize the error, and leave the room. A reaction should not in- clude such irrelevant actions. In addition, IFs may accomplish the same goal using different behaviors: two different IFs may interpret “go to the pink room” by following different paths to the same destination. We would like to be able to generalize both reactions into one canonical reaction. As a result, our approach discretizes reactions into higher-level action sequences with less noise and less variation. Our discretization algorithm uses an automated planner and a planning representation of the task. This planning representation includes: (1) the task goal, (2) the actions which can be taken in the virtual world, and (3) the current state of the virtual world. Using the planning representation, the planner calculates an optimal path between the starting and ending states of the reaction, eliminating all unnecessary actions. While we use the classical planner FF (Hoffmann, 2003), our technique could also work with classical planning (Nau et al., 2004) or other techniques such as probabilistic planning (Bonet and Geffner, 2005). It is also not dependent on a particular discretization of the world in terms of actions. Now we are ready to define canonical reaction ck formally. Let Sk be the state of the virtual world when instruction uk was uttered, Sk+1 be the state of the world where the reaction ends (as defined by Bhv or Vis segmentation), and D be the planning domain representation of the virtual world. The canonical reaction to uk is defined as the sequence of actions 183 returned by the planner with Sk as initial state, Sk+1 as goal state and D as planning domain. 3.2 Interpretation phase The annotation phase results in a collection of (uk, ck) pairs. The interpretation phase uses these pairs to interpret new utterances in three steps. First, we filter the set of pairs into those whose reactions can be directly executed from the current IF position. Second, we group the filtered pairs according to their reactions. Third, we select the group with utterances most similar to the new utterance, and output that group’s reaction. Figure 2 shows the output of the first two steps: three groups of pairs whose reactions can all be executed from the IF’s current position. Figure 2: Utterance groups for this situation. Colored arrows show the reaction associated with each group. We treat the third step, selecting the most similar group for a new utterance, as a classification problem. We compare three different classification methods. One method uses nearest-neighbor classification with three different similarity metrics: Jaccard and Overlap coefficients (both of which measure the degree of overlap between two sets, differing only in the normalization of the final value (Nikravesh et al., 2005)), and Levenshtein Distance (a string met- ric for measuring the amount of differences between two sequences of words (Levenshtein, 1966)). Our second classification method employs a strategy in which we considered each group as a set of possible machine translations of our utterance, using the BLEU measure (Papineni et al., 2002) to select which group could be considered the best translation of our utterance. Finally, we trained an SVM classifier (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) using the unigrams Corpus Cm Corpus Cs Algorithm Bhv Vis Bhv Vis Jaccard47%54%54%70% Overlap BLEU SVM Levenshtein 43% 44% 33% 21% 53% 52% 29% 20% 45% 54% 45% 8% 60% 50% 29% 17% Table 1: Accuracy comparison between Cm and Cs for Bhv and Vis segmentation of each paraphrase and the position of the IF as features, and setting their group as the output class using a libSVM wrapper (Chang and Lin, 2011). When the system misinterprets an instruction we use a similar approach to what people do in order to overcome misunderstandings. If the system executes an incorrect reaction, the IG can tell the system to cancel its current interpretation and try again using a paraphrase, selecting a different reaction. 4 Evaluation For the evaluation phase, we annotated both the Cm and Cs corpora entirely, and then we split them in an 80/20 proportion; the first 80% of data collected in each virtual world was used for training, while the remaining 20% was used for testing. For each pair (uk, ck) in the testing set, we used our algorithm to predict the reaction to the selected utterance, and then compared this result against the automatically annotated reaction. Table 1 shows the results. Comparing the Bhv and Vis segmentation strategies, Vis tends to obtain better results than Bhv. In addition, accuracy on the Cs corpus was generally higher than Cm. Given that Cs contained only one IG, we believe this led to less variability in the instructions and less noise in the training data. We evaluated the impact of user corrections by simulating them using the existing corpus. In case of a wrong response, the algorithm receives a second utterance with the same reaction (a paraphrase of the previous one). Then the new utterance is tested over the same set of possible groups, except for the one which was returned before. If the correct reaction is not predicted after four tries, or there are no utterances with the same reaction, the predictions are registered as wrong. To measure the effects of user corrections vs. without, we used a different evalu184 ation process for this algorithm: first, we split the corpus in a 50/50 proportion, and then we moved correctly predicted utterances from the testing set towards training, until either there was nothing more to learn or the training set reached 80% of the entire corpus size. As expected, user corrections significantly improve accuracy, as shown in Figure 3. The worst algorithm’s results improve linearly with each try, while the best ones behave asymptotically, barely improving after the second try. The best algorithm reaches 92% with just one correction from the IG. 5 Discussion and future work We presented an approach to instruction interpretation which learns from non-annotated logs of human behavior. Our empirical analysis shows that our best algorithm achieves 70% accuracy on this task, with no manual annotation required. When corrections are added, accuracy goes up to 92% for just one correction. We consider our results promising since state of the art semi-unsupervised approaches to instruction interpretation (Chen and Mooney, 2011) reports a 55% accuracy on manually segmented data. We plan to compare our system’s performance against human performance in comparable situations. Our informal observations of the GIVE corpus indicate that humans often follow instructions incorrectly, so our automated system’s performance may be on par with human performance. Although we have presented our approach in the context of 3D virtual worlds, we believe our technique is also applicable to other domains such as the web, video games, or Human Robot Interaction.

<p>Author: Wei-Jie Huang ; Chia-Ru Chou ; Yu-Lin Tzeng ; Chia-Ying Lee ; Chao-Lin Liu</p><p>Abstract: We demonstrate applications of psycholinguistic and sublexical information for learning Chinese characters. The knowledge about the grapheme-phoneme conversion (GPC) rules of languages has been shown to be highly correlated to the ability of reading alphabetic languages and Chinese. We build and will demo a game platform for strengthening the association of phonological components in Chinese characters with the pronunciations of the characters. Results of a preliminary evaluation of our games indicated significant improvement in learners’ response times in Chinese naming tasks. In addition, we construct a Webbased open system for teachers to prepare their own games to best meet their teaching goals. Techniques for decomposing Chinese characters and for comparing the similarity between Chinese characters were employed to recommend lists of Chinese characters for authoring the games. Evaluation of the authoring environment with 20 subjects showed that our system made the authoring of games more effective and efficient.</p><p>5 0.10999279 <a title="24-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-IRIS%3A_a_Chat-oriented_Dialogue_System_based_on_the_Vector_Space_Model.html">114 acl-2012-IRIS: a Chat-oriented Dialogue System based on the Vector Space Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Luciana Benotti ; Martin Villalba ; Tessa Lau ; Julian Cerruti</p><p>Abstract: Previous approaches to instruction interpretation have required either extensive domain adaptation or manually annotated corpora. This paper presents a novel approach to instruction interpretation that leverages a large amount of unannotated, easy-to-collect data from humans interacting with a virtual world. We compare several algorithms for automatically segmenting and discretizing this data into (utterance, reaction) pairs and training a classifier to predict reactions given the next utterance. Our empirical analysis shows that the best algorithm achieves 70% accuracy on this task, with no manual annotation required. 1 Introduction and motivation Mapping instructions into automatically executable actions would enable the creation of natural lan- , guage interfaces to many applications (Lau et al., 2009; Branavan et al., 2009; Orkin and Roy, 2009). In this paper, we focus on the task of navigation and manipulation of a virtual environment (Vogel and Jurafsky, 2010; Chen and Mooney, 2011). Current symbolic approaches to the problem are brittle to the natural language variation present in instructions and require intensive rule authoring to be fit for a new task (Dzikovska et al., 2008). Current statistical approaches require extensive manual annotations of the corpora used for training (MacMahon et al., 2006; Matuszek et al., 2010; Gorniak and Roy, 2007; Rieser and Lemon, 2010). Manual annotation and rule authoring by natural language engineering experts are bottlenecks for developing conversational systems for new domains. 181 t e s s al au @ us . ibm . com, j ce rrut i ar .ibm . com @ This paper proposes a fully automated approach to interpreting natural language instructions to complete a task in a virtual world based on unsupervised recordings of human-human interactions perform- ing that task in that virtual world. Given unannotated corpora collected from humans following other humans’ instructions, our system automatically segments the corpus into labeled training data for a classification algorithm. Our interpretation algorithm is based on the observation that similar instructions uttered in similar contexts should lead to similar actions being taken in the virtual world. Given a previously unseen instruction, our system outputs actions that can be directly executed in the virtual world, based on what humans did when given similar instructions in the past. 2 Corpora situated in virtual worlds Our environment consists of six virtual worlds designed for the natural language generation shared task known as the GIVE Challenge (Koller et al., 2010), where a pair of partners must collaborate to solve a task in a 3D space (Figure 1). The “instruction follower” (IF) can move around in the virtual world, but has no knowledge of the task. The “instruction giver” (IG) types instructions to the IF in order to guide him to accomplish the task. Each corpus contains the IF’s actions and position recorded every 200 milliseconds, as well as the IG’s instruc- tions with their timestamps. We used two corpora for our experiments. The Cm corpus (Gargett et al., 2010) contains instructions given by multiple people, consisting of 37 games spanning 2163 instructions over 8: 17 hs.

The world consists of interconnecting hallways, rooms and objects Cs corpus (Benotti and Denis, 2011), gathered using a single IG, is composed of 63 games and 3417 in- structions, and was recorded in a span of 6:09 hs. It took less than 15 hours to collect the corpora through the web and the subjects reported that the experiment was fun. While the environment is restricted, people describe the same route and the same objects in extremely different ways. Below are some examples of instructions from our corpus all given for the same route shown in Figure 1. 1) out 2) walk down the passage 3) nowgo [sic] to the pink room 4) back to the room with the plant 5) Go through the door on the left 6) go through opening with yellow wall paper People describe routes using landmarks (4) or specific actions (2). They may describe the same object differently (5 vs 6). Instructions also differ in their scope (3 vs 1). Thus, even ignoring spelling and grammatical errors, navigation instructions contain considerable variation which makes interpreting them a challenging problem. 3 Learning from previous interpretations Our algorithm consists of two phases: annotation and interpretation. Annotation is performed only once and consists of automatically associating each IG instruction to an IF reaction. Interpretation is performed every time the system receives an instruc182 tion and consists of predicting an appropriate reaction given reactions observed in the corpus. Our method is based on the assumption that a reaction captures the semantics of the instruction that caused it. Therefore, if two utterances result in the same reaction, they are paraphrases of each other, and similar utterances should generate the same reaction. This approach enables us to predict reactions for previously-unseen instructions. 3.1 Annotation phase The key challenge in learning from massive amounts of easily-collected data is to automatically annotate an unannotated corpus. Our annotation method consists of two parts: first, segmenting a low-level interaction trace into utterances and corresponding reactions, and second, discretizing those reactions into canonical action sequences. Segmentation enables our algorithm to learn from traces of IFs interacting directly with a virtual world. Since the IF can move freely in the virtual world, his actions are a stream of continuous behavior. Segmentation divides these traces into reactions that follow from each utterance of the IG. Consider the following example starting at the situation shown in Figure 1: IG(1): go through the yellow opening IF(2): [walks out of the room] IF(3): [turns left at the intersection] IF(4): [enters the room with the sofa] IG(5): stop It is not clear whether the IF is doing h3, 4i because h neo tis c reacting htoe r1 t or Fbec isadu soei hge h 3is, being proactive. While one could manually annotate this data to remove extraneous actions, our goal is to develop automated solutions that enable learning from massive amounts of data. We decided to approach this problem by experimenting with two alternative formal definitions: 1) a strict definition that considers the maximum reaction according to the IF behavior, and 2) a loose defini- tion based on the empirical observation that, in situated interaction, most instructions are constrained by the current visually perceived affordances (Gibson, 1979; Stoia et al., 2006). We formally define behavior segmentation (Bhv) as follows. A reaction rk to an instruction uk begins right after the instruction uk is uttered and ends right before the next instruction uk+1 is uttered. In the example, instruction 1corresponds to h2, 3, 4i . We formally d inefsitnrue visibility segmentation (Vis) as f Wolelows. A reaction rk to an instruction uk begins right after the instruction uk is uttered and ends right before the next instruction uk+1 is uttered or right after the IF leaves the area visible at 360◦ from where uk was uttered. In the example, instruction 1’s reaction would be limited to h2i because the intersection is nwootu vldisi bbele l ifmroimte dw htoer he2 tihe b eicnasutrsuec ttihoen was suetctetiroend. The Bhv and Vis methods define how to segment an interaction trace into utterances and their corresponding reactions. However, users frequently perform noisy behavior that is irrelevant to the goal of the task. For example, after hearing an instruction, an IF might go into the wrong room, realize the error, and leave the room. A reaction should not in- clude such irrelevant actions. In addition, IFs may accomplish the same goal using different behaviors: two different IFs may interpret “go to the pink room” by following different paths to the same destination. We would like to be able to generalize both reactions into one canonical reaction. As a result, our approach discretizes reactions into higher-level action sequences with less noise and less variation. Our discretization algorithm uses an automated planner and a planning representation of the task. This planning representation includes: (1) the task goal, (2) the actions which can be taken in the virtual world, and (3) the current state of the virtual world. Using the planning representation, the planner calculates an optimal path between the starting and ending states of the reaction, eliminating all unnecessary actions. While we use the classical planner FF (Hoffmann, 2003), our technique could also work with classical planning (Nau et al., 2004) or other techniques such as probabilistic planning (Bonet and Geffner, 2005). It is also not dependent on a particular discretization of the world in terms of actions. Now we are ready to define canonical reaction ck formally. Let Sk be the state of the virtual world when instruction uk was uttered, Sk+1 be the state of the world where the reaction ends (as defined by Bhv or Vis segmentation), and D be the planning domain representation of the virtual world. The canonical reaction to uk is defined as the sequence of actions 183 returned by the planner with Sk as initial state, Sk+1 as goal state and D as planning domain. 3.2 Interpretation phase The annotation phase results in a collection of (uk, ck) pairs. The interpretation phase uses these pairs to interpret new utterances in three steps. First, we filter the set of pairs into those whose reactions can be directly executed from the current IF position. Second, we group the filtered pairs according to their reactions. Third, we select the group with utterances most similar to the new utterance, and output that group’s reaction. Figure 2 shows the output of the first two steps: three groups of pairs whose reactions can all be executed from the IF’s current position. Figure 2: Utterance groups for this situation. Colored arrows show the reaction associated with each group. We treat the third step, selecting the most similar group for a new utterance, as a classification problem. We compare three different classification methods. One method uses nearest-neighbor classification with three different similarity metrics: Jaccard and Overlap coefficients (both of which measure the degree of overlap between two sets, differing only in the normalization of the final value (Nikravesh et al., 2005)), and Levenshtein Distance (a string met- ric for measuring the amount of differences between two sequences of words (Levenshtein, 1966)). Our second classification method employs a strategy in which we considered each group as a set of possible machine translations of our utterance, using the BLEU measure (Papineni et al., 2002) to select which group could be considered the best translation of our utterance. Finally, we trained an SVM classifier (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) using the unigrams Corpus Cm Corpus Cs Algorithm Bhv Vis Bhv Vis Jaccard47%54%54%70% Overlap BLEU SVM Levenshtein 43% 44% 33% 21% 53% 52% 29% 20% 45% 54% 45% 8% 60% 50% 29% 17% Table 1: Accuracy comparison between Cm and Cs for Bhv and Vis segmentation of each paraphrase and the position of the IF as features, and setting their group as the output class using a libSVM wrapper (Chang and Lin, 2011). When the system misinterprets an instruction we use a similar approach to what people do in order to overcome misunderstandings. If the system executes an incorrect reaction, the IG can tell the system to cancel its current interpretation and try again using a paraphrase, selecting a different reaction. 4 Evaluation For the evaluation phase, we annotated both the Cm and Cs corpora entirely, and then we split them in an 80/20 proportion; the first 80% of data collected in each virtual world was used for training, while the remaining 20% was used for testing. For each pair (uk, ck) in the testing set, we used our algorithm to predict the reaction to the selected utterance, and then compared this result against the automatically annotated reaction. Table 1 shows the results. Comparing the Bhv and Vis segmentation strategies, Vis tends to obtain better results than Bhv. In addition, accuracy on the Cs corpus was generally higher than Cm. Given that Cs contained only one IG, we believe this led to less variability in the instructions and less noise in the training data. We evaluated the impact of user corrections by simulating them using the existing corpus. In case of a wrong response, the algorithm receives a second utterance with the same reaction (a paraphrase of the previous one). Then the new utterance is tested over the same set of possible groups, except for the one which was returned before. If the correct reaction is not predicted after four tries, or there are no utterances with the same reaction, the predictions are registered as wrong. To measure the effects of user corrections vs. without, we used a different evalu184 ation process for this algorithm: first, we split the corpus in a 50/50 proportion, and then we moved correctly predicted utterances from the testing set towards training, until either there was nothing more to learn or the training set reached 80% of the entire corpus size. As expected, user corrections significantly improve accuracy, as shown in Figure 3. The worst algorithm’s results improve linearly with each try, while the best ones behave asymptotically, barely improving after the second try. The best algorithm reaches 92% with just one correction from the IG. 5 Discussion and future work We presented an approach to instruction interpretation which learns from non-annotated logs of human behavior. Our empirical analysis shows that our best algorithm achieves 70% accuracy on this task, with no manual annotation required. When corrections are added, accuracy goes up to 92% for just one correction. We consider our results promising since state of the art semi-unsupervised approaches to instruction interpretation (Chen and Mooney, 2011) reports a 55% accuracy on manually segmented data. We plan to compare our system’s performance against human performance in comparable situations. Our informal observations of the GIVE corpus indicate that humans often follow instructions incorrectly, so our automated system’s performance may be on par with human performance. Although we have presented our approach in the context of 3D virtual worlds, we believe our technique is also applicable to other domains such as the web, video games, or Human Robot Interaction.

<p>Author: David Chen</p><p>Abstract: Learning a semantic lexicon is often an important first step in building a system that learns to interpret the meaning of natural language. It is especially important in language grounding where the training data usually consist of language paired with an ambiguous perceptual context. Recent work by Chen and Mooney (201 1) introduced a lexicon learning method that deals with ambiguous relational data by taking intersections of graphs. While the algorithm produced good lexicons for the task of learning to interpret navigation instructions, it only works in batch settings and does not scale well to large datasets. In this paper we introduce a new online algorithm that is an order of magnitude faster and surpasses the stateof-the-art results. We show that by changing the grammar of the formal meaning represen- . tation language and training on additional data collected from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk we can further improve the results. We also include experimental results on a Chinese translation of the training data to demonstrate the generality of our approach.</p><p>4 0.41310531 <a title="24-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-Learning_High-Level_Planning_from_Text.html">129 acl-2012-Learning High-Level Planning from Text</a></p>
<p>Author: S.R.K. Branavan ; Nate Kushman ; Tao Lei ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: Comprehending action preconditions and effects is an essential step in modeling the dynamics of the world. In this paper, we express the semantics of precondition relations extracted from text in terms of planning operations. The challenge of modeling this connection is to ground language at the level of relations. This type of grounding enables us to create high-level plans based on language abstractions. Our model jointly learns to predict precondition relations from text and to perform high-level planning guided by those relations. We implement this idea in the reinforcement learning framework using feedback automatically obtained from plan execution attempts. When applied to a complex virtual world and text describing that world, our relation extraction technique performs on par with a supervised baseline, yielding an F-measure of 66% compared to the baseline’s 65%. Additionally, we show that a high-level planner utilizing these extracted relations significantly outperforms a strong, text unaware baseline successfully completing 80% of planning tasks as compared to 69% for the baseline.1 –</p><p>5 0.33661294 <a title="24-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-Spice_it_up%3F_Mining_Refinements_to_Online_Instructions_from_User_Generated_Content.html">182 acl-2012-Spice it up?

<p>Author: Gregory Druck ; Bo Pang</p><p>Abstract: There are a growing number of popular web sites where users submit and review instructions for completing tasks as varied as building a table and baking a pie. In addition to providing their subjective evaluation, reviewers often provide actionable refinements. These refinements clarify, correct, improve, or provide alternatives to the original instructions. However, identifying and reading all relevant reviews is a daunting task for a user. In this paper, we propose a generative model that jointly identifies user-proposed refinements in instruction reviews at multiple granularities, and aligns them to the appropriate steps in the original instructions. Labeled data is not readily available for these tasks, so we focus on the unsupervised setting. In experiments in the recipe domain, our model provides 90. 1% F1 for predicting refinements at the review level, and 77.0% F1 for predicting refinement segments within reviews.</p><p>6 0.31841114 <a title="24-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-Qualitative_Modeling_of_Spatial_Prepositions_and_Motion_Expressions.html">166 acl-2012-Qualitative Modeling of Spatial Prepositions and Motion Expressions</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuening Hu ; Jordan Boyd-Graber</p><p>Abstract: Topic modeling with a tree-based prior has been used for a variety of applications because it can encode correlations between words that traditional topic modeling cannot. However, its expressive power comes at the cost of more complicated inference. We extend the SPARSELDA (Yao et al., 2009) inference scheme for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to tree-based topic models. This sampling scheme computes the exact conditional distribution for Gibbs sampling much more quickly than enumerating all possible latent variable assignments. We further improve performance by iteratively refining the sampling distribution only when needed. Experiments show that the proposed techniques dramatically improve the computation time.</p><p>3 0.49431232 <a title="24-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Learning_to_%22Read_Between_the_Lines%22_using_Bayesian_Logic_Programs.html">133 acl-2012-Learning to "Read Between the Lines" using Bayesian Logic Programs</a></p>
<p>Author: Sindhu Raghavan ; Raymond Mooney ; Hyeonseo Ku</p><p>Abstract: Most information extraction (IE) systems identify facts that are explicitly stated in text. However, in natural language, some facts are implicit, and identifying them requires “reading between the lines”. Human readers naturally use common sense knowledge to infer such implicit information from the explicitly stated facts. We propose an approach that uses Bayesian Logic Programs (BLPs), a statistical relational model combining firstorder logic and Bayesian networks, to infer additional implicit information from extracted facts. It involves learning uncertain commonsense knowledge (in the form of probabilistic first-order rules) from natural language text by mining a large corpus of automatically extracted facts. These rules are then used to derive additional facts from extracted information using BLP inference. Experimental evaluation on a benchmark data set for machine reading demonstrates the efficacy of our approach.</p><p>4 0.32933432 <a title="24-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Corpus-based_Interpretation_of_Instructions_in_Virtual_Environments.html">59 acl-2012-Corpus-based Interpretation of Instructions in Virtual Environments</a></p>
<p>Author: Luciana Benotti ; Martin Villalba ; Tessa Lau ; Julian Cerruti</p><p>Abstract: Previous approaches to instruction interpretation have required either extensive domain adaptation or manually annotated corpora. This paper presents a novel approach to instruction interpretation that leverages a large amount of unannotated, easy-to-collect data from humans interacting with a virtual world. We compare several algorithms for automatically segmenting and discretizing this data into (utterance, reaction) pairs and training a classifier to predict reactions given the next utterance. Our empirical analysis shows that the best algorithm achieves 70% accuracy on this task, with no manual annotation required. 1 Introduction and motivation Mapping instructions into automatically executable actions would enable the creation of natural lan- , guage interfaces to many applications (Lau et al., 2009; Branavan et al., 2009; Orkin and Roy, 2009). In this paper, we focus on the task of navigation and manipulation of a virtual environment (Vogel and Jurafsky, 2010; Chen and Mooney, 2011). Current symbolic approaches to the problem are brittle to the natural language variation present in instructions and require intensive rule authoring to be fit for a new task (Dzikovska et al., 2008). Current statistical approaches require extensive manual annotations of the corpora used for training (MacMahon et al., 2006; Matuszek et al., 2010; Gorniak and Roy, 2007; Rieser and Lemon, 2010). Manual annotation and rule authoring by natural language engineering experts are bottlenecks for developing conversational systems for new domains. 181 t e s s al au @ us . ibm . com, j ce rrut i ar .ibm . com @ This paper proposes a fully automated approach to interpreting natural language instructions to complete a task in a virtual world based on unsupervised recordings of human-human interactions perform- ing that task in that virtual world. Given unannotated corpora collected from humans following other humans’ instructions, our system automatically segments the corpus into labeled training data for a classification algorithm. Our interpretation algorithm is based on the observation that similar instructions uttered in similar contexts should lead to similar actions being taken in the virtual world. Given a previously unseen instruction, our system outputs actions that can be directly executed in the virtual world, based on what humans did when given similar instructions in the past. 2 Corpora situated in virtual worlds Our environment consists of six virtual worlds designed for the natural language generation shared task known as the GIVE Challenge (Koller et al., 2010), where a pair of partners must collaborate to solve a task in a 3D space (Figure 1). The “instruction follower” (IF) can move around in the virtual world, but has no knowledge of the task. The “instruction giver” (IG) types instructions to the IF in order to guide him to accomplish the task. Each corpus contains the IF’s actions and position recorded every 200 milliseconds, as well as the IG’s instruc- tions with their timestamps. We used two corpora for our experiments. The Cm corpus (Gargett et al., 2010) contains instructions given by multiple people, consisting of 37 games spanning 2163 instructions over 8: 17 hs.

The world consists of interconnecting hallways, rooms and objects Cs corpus (Benotti and Denis, 2011), gathered using a single IG, is composed of 63 games and 3417 in- structions, and was recorded in a span of 6:09 hs. It took less than 15 hours to collect the corpora through the web and the subjects reported that the experiment was fun. While the environment is restricted, people describe the same route and the same objects in extremely different ways. Below are some examples of instructions from our corpus all given for the same route shown in Figure 1. 1) out 2) walk down the passage 3) nowgo [sic] to the pink room 4) back to the room with the plant 5) Go through the door on the left 6) go through opening with yellow wall paper People describe routes using landmarks (4) or specific actions (2). They may describe the same object differently (5 vs 6). Instructions also differ in their scope (3 vs 1). Thus, even ignoring spelling and grammatical errors, navigation instructions contain considerable variation which makes interpreting them a challenging problem. 3 Learning from previous interpretations Our algorithm consists of two phases: annotation and interpretation. Annotation is performed only once and consists of automatically associating each IG instruction to an IF reaction. Interpretation is performed every time the system receives an instruc182 tion and consists of predicting an appropriate reaction given reactions observed in the corpus. Our method is based on the assumption that a reaction captures the semantics of the instruction that caused it. Therefore, if two utterances result in the same reaction, they are paraphrases of each other, and similar utterances should generate the same reaction. This approach enables us to predict reactions for previously-unseen instructions. 3.1 Annotation phase The key challenge in learning from massive amounts of easily-collected data is to automatically annotate an unannotated corpus. Our annotation method consists of two parts: first, segmenting a low-level interaction trace into utterances and corresponding reactions, and second, discretizing those reactions into canonical action sequences. Segmentation enables our algorithm to learn from traces of IFs interacting directly with a virtual world. Since the IF can move freely in the virtual world, his actions are a stream of continuous behavior. Segmentation divides these traces into reactions that follow from each utterance of the IG. Consider the following example starting at the situation shown in Figure 1: IG(1): go through the yellow opening IF(2): [walks out of the room] IF(3): [turns left at the intersection] IF(4): [enters the room with the sofa] IG(5): stop It is not clear whether the IF is doing h3, 4i because h neo tis c reacting htoe r1 t or Fbec isadu soei hge h 3is, being proactive. While one could manually annotate this data to remove extraneous actions, our goal is to develop automated solutions that enable learning from massive amounts of data. We decided to approach this problem by experimenting with two alternative formal definitions: 1) a strict definition that considers the maximum reaction according to the IF behavior, and 2) a loose defini- tion based on the empirical observation that, in situated interaction, most instructions are constrained by the current visually perceived affordances (Gibson, 1979; Stoia et al., 2006). We formally define behavior segmentation (Bhv) as follows. A reaction rk to an instruction uk begins right after the instruction uk is uttered and ends right before the next instruction uk+1 is uttered. In the example, instruction 1corresponds to h2, 3, 4i . We formally d inefsitnrue visibility segmentation (Vis) as f Wolelows. A reaction rk to an instruction uk begins right after the instruction uk is uttered and ends right before the next instruction uk+1 is uttered or right after the IF leaves the area visible at 360◦ from where uk was uttered. In the example, instruction 1’s reaction would be limited to h2i because the intersection is nwootu vldisi bbele l ifmroimte dw htoer he2 tihe b eicnasutrsuec ttihoen was suetctetiroend. The Bhv and Vis methods define how to segment an interaction trace into utterances and their corresponding reactions. However, users frequently perform noisy behavior that is irrelevant to the goal of the task. For example, after hearing an instruction, an IF might go into the wrong room, realize the error, and leave the room. A reaction should not in- clude such irrelevant actions. In addition, IFs may accomplish the same goal using different behaviors: two different IFs may interpret “go to the pink room” by following different paths to the same destination. We would like to be able to generalize both reactions into one canonical reaction. As a result, our approach discretizes reactions into higher-level action sequences with less noise and less variation. Our discretization algorithm uses an automated planner and a planning representation of the task. This planning representation includes: (1) the task goal, (2) the actions which can be taken in the virtual world, and (3) the current state of the virtual world. Using the planning representation, the planner calculates an optimal path between the starting and ending states of the reaction, eliminating all unnecessary actions. While we use the classical planner FF (Hoffmann, 2003), our technique could also work with classical planning (Nau et al., 2004) or other techniques such as probabilistic planning (Bonet and Geffner, 2005). It is also not dependent on a particular discretization of the world in terms of actions. Now we are ready to define canonical reaction ck formally. Let Sk be the state of the virtual world when instruction uk was uttered, Sk+1 be the state of the world where the reaction ends (as defined by Bhv or Vis segmentation), and D be the planning domain representation of the virtual world. The canonical reaction to uk is defined as the sequence of actions 183 returned by the planner with Sk as initial state, Sk+1 as goal state and D as planning domain. 3.2 Interpretation phase The annotation phase results in a collection of (uk, ck) pairs. The interpretation phase uses these pairs to interpret new utterances in three steps. First, we filter the set of pairs into those whose reactions can be directly executed from the current IF position. Second, we group the filtered pairs according to their reactions. Third, we select the group with utterances most similar to the new utterance, and output that group’s reaction. Figure 2 shows the output of the first two steps: three groups of pairs whose reactions can all be executed from the IF’s current position. Figure 2: Utterance groups for this situation. Colored arrows show the reaction associated with each group. We treat the third step, selecting the most similar group for a new utterance, as a classification problem. We compare three different classification methods. One method uses nearest-neighbor classification with three different similarity metrics: Jaccard and Overlap coefficients (both of which measure the degree of overlap between two sets, differing only in the normalization of the final value (Nikravesh et al., 2005)), and Levenshtein Distance (a string met- ric for measuring the amount of differences between two sequences of words (Levenshtein, 1966)). Our second classification method employs a strategy in which we considered each group as a set of possible machine translations of our utterance, using the BLEU measure (Papineni et al., 2002) to select which group could be considered the best translation of our utterance. Finally, we trained an SVM classifier (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) using the unigrams Corpus Cm Corpus Cs Algorithm Bhv Vis Bhv Vis Jaccard47%54%54%70% Overlap BLEU SVM Levenshtein 43% 44% 33% 21% 53% 52% 29% 20% 45% 54% 45% 8% 60% 50% 29% 17% Table 1: Accuracy comparison between Cm and Cs for Bhv and Vis segmentation of each paraphrase and the position of the IF as features, and setting their group as the output class using a libSVM wrapper (Chang and Lin, 2011). When the system misinterprets an instruction we use a similar approach to what people do in order to overcome misunderstandings. If the system executes an incorrect reaction, the IG can tell the system to cancel its current interpretation and try again using a paraphrase, selecting a different reaction. 4 Evaluation For the evaluation phase, we annotated both the Cm and Cs corpora entirely, and then we split them in an 80/20 proportion; the first 80% of data collected in each virtual world was used for training, while the remaining 20% was used for testing. For each pair (uk, ck) in the testing set, we used our algorithm to predict the reaction to the selected utterance, and then compared this result against the automatically annotated reaction. Table 1 shows the results. Comparing the Bhv and Vis segmentation strategies, Vis tends to obtain better results than Bhv. In addition, accuracy on the Cs corpus was generally higher than Cm. Given that Cs contained only one IG, we believe this led to less variability in the instructions and less noise in the training data. We evaluated the impact of user corrections by simulating them using the existing corpus. In case of a wrong response, the algorithm receives a second utterance with the same reaction (a paraphrase of the previous one). Then the new utterance is tested over the same set of possible groups, except for the one which was returned before. If the correct reaction is not predicted after four tries, or there are no utterances with the same reaction, the predictions are registered as wrong. To measure the effects of user corrections vs. without, we used a different evalu184 ation process for this algorithm: first, we split the corpus in a 50/50 proportion, and then we moved correctly predicted utterances from the testing set towards training, until either there was nothing more to learn or the training set reached 80% of the entire corpus size. As expected, user corrections significantly improve accuracy, as shown in Figure 3. The worst algorithm’s results improve linearly with each try, while the best ones behave asymptotically, barely improving after the second try. The best algorithm reaches 92% with just one correction from the IG. 5 Discussion and future work We presented an approach to instruction interpretation which learns from non-annotated logs of human behavior. Our empirical analysis shows that our best algorithm achieves 70% accuracy on this task, with no manual annotation required. When corrections are added, accuracy goes up to 92% for just one correction. We consider our results promising since state of the art semi-unsupervised approaches to instruction interpretation (Chen and Mooney, 2011) reports a 55% accuracy on manually segmented data. We plan to compare our system’s performance against human performance in comparable situations. Our informal observations of the GIVE corpus indicate that humans often follow instructions incorrectly, so our automated system’s performance may be on par with human performance. Although we have presented our approach in the context of 3D virtual worlds, we believe our technique is also applicable to other domains such as the web, video games, or Human Robot Interaction.

<p>Author: David Chen</p><p>Abstract: Learning a semantic lexicon is often an important first step in building a system that learns to interpret the meaning of natural language. It is especially important in language grounding where the training data usually consist of language paired with an ambiguous perceptual context. Recent work by Chen and Mooney (201 1) introduced a lexicon learning method that deals with ambiguous relational data by taking intersections of graphs. While the algorithm produced good lexicons for the task of learning to interpret navigation instructions, it only works in batch settings and does not scale well to large datasets. In this paper we introduce a new online algorithm that is an order of magnitude faster and surpasses the stateof-the-art results. We show that by changing the grammar of the formal meaning represen- . tation language and training on additional data collected from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk we can further improve the results. We also include experimental results on a Chinese translation of the training data to demonstrate the generality of our approach.</p><p>6 0.32750919 <a title="24-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-A_Graphical_Interface_for_MT_Evaluation_and_Error_Analysis.html">13 acl-2012-A Graphical Interface for MT Evaluation and Error Analysis</a></p>

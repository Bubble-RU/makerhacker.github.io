<p>Author: Ariya Rastrow ; Mark Dredze ; Sanjeev Khudanpur</p><p>Abstract: Long-span features, such as syntax, can improve language models for tasks such as speech recognition and machine translation. However, these language models can be difficult to use in practice because of the time required to generate features for rescoring a large hypothesis set. In this work, we propose substructure sharing, which saves duplicate work in processing hypothesis sets with redundant hypothesis structures. We apply substructure sharing to a dependency parser and part of speech tagger to obtain significant speedups, and further improve the accuracy of these tools through up-training. When using these improved tools in a language model for speech recognition, we obtain significant speed improvements with both N-best and hill climbing rescoring, and show that up-training leads to WER reduction.</p><p>3 0.11201654 <a title="32-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-The_OpenGrm_open-source_finite-state_grammar_software_libraries.html">196 acl-2012-The OpenGrm open-source finite-state grammar software libraries</a></p>

<p>Author: Khe Chai Sim</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic framework that combines multiple knowledge sources for Haptic Voice Recognition (HVR), a multimodal input method designed to provide efficient text entry on modern mobile devices. HVR extends the conventional voice input by allowing users to provide complementary partial lexical information via touch input to improve the efficiency and accuracy of voice recognition. This paper investigates the use of the initial letter of the words in the utterance as the partial lexical information. In addition to the acoustic and language models used in automatic speech recognition systems, HVR uses the haptic and partial lexical models as additional knowledge sources to reduce the recognition search space and suppress confusions. Experimental results show that both the word error rate and runtime factor can be re- duced by a factor of two using HVR.</p><p>5 0.094799563 <a title="32-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-A_Corpus_of_Textual_Revisions_in_Second_Language_Writing.html">8 acl-2012-A Corpus of Textual Revisions in Second Language Writing</a></p>

<p>Author: Bevan Jones ; Mark Johnson ; Sharon Goldwater</p><p>Abstract: Many semantic parsing models use tree transformations to map between natural language and meaning representation. However, while tree transformations are central to several state-of-the-art approaches, little use has been made of the rich literature on tree automata. This paper makes the connection concrete with a tree transducer based semantic parsing model and suggests that other models can be interpreted in a similar framework, increasing the generality of their contributions. In particular, this paper further introduces a variational Bayesian inference algorithm that is applicable to a wide class of tree transducers, producing state-of-the-art semantic parsing results while remaining applicable to any domain employing probabilistic tree transducers.</p><p>6 0.35878623 <a title="32-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-Beefmoves%3A_Dissemination%2C_Diversity%2C_and_Dynamics_of_English_Borrowings_in_a_German_Hip_Hop_Forum.html">39 acl-2012-Beefmoves: Dissemination, Diversity, and Dynamics of English Borrowings in a German Hip Hop Forum</a></p>

We jointly model the interplay between latent user intents that govern queries and unobserved entity types, leveraging observed signals from query formulations and document clicks. We apply the models to resolve entity types in new queries and to assign prior type distributions over an existing knowledge base. Our models are efficiently trained using maximum likelihood estimation over millions of real-world Web search queries. We show that modeling user intent significantly improves entity type resolution for head queries over the state ofthe art, on several metrics, without degradation in tail query performance.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.9139204 <a title="32-lda-2" href="./acl-2012-Automated_Essay_Scoring_Based_on_Finite_State_Transducer%3A_towards_ASR_Transcription_of_Oral_English_Speech.html">32 acl-2012-Automated Essay Scoring Based on Finite State Transducer: towards ASR Transcription of Oral English Speech</a></p>

<p>Author: Weiwei Guo ; Mona Diab</p><p>Abstract: Sentence Similarity is the process of computing a similarity score between two sentences. Previous sentence similarity work finds that latent semantics approaches to the problem do not perform well due to insufficient information in single sentences. In this paper, we show that by carefully handling words that are not in the sentences (missing words), we can train a reliable latent variable model on sentences. In the process, we propose a new evaluation framework for sentence similarity: Concept Definition Retrieval. The new framework allows for large scale tuning and testing of Sentence Similarity models. Experiments on the new task and previous data sets show significant improvement of our model over baselines and other traditional latent variable models. Our results indicate comparable and even better performance than current state of the art systems addressing the problem of sentence similarity.</p><p>5 0.81108594 <a title="32-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Learning_the_Latent_Semantics_of_a_Concept_from_its_Definition.html">132 acl-2012-Learning the Latent Semantics of a Concept from its Definition</a></p>

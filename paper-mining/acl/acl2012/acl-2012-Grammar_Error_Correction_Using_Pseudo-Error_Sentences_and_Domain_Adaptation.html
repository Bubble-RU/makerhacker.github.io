<p>Author: Toshikazu Tajiri ; Mamoru Komachi ; Yuji Matsumoto</p><p>Abstract: As the number of learners of English is constantly growing, automatic error correction of ESL learnersâ€™ writing is an increasingly active area of research. However, most research has mainly focused on errors concerning articles and prepositions even though tense/aspect errors are also important. One of the main reasons why tense/aspect error correction is difficult is that the choice of tense/aspect is highly dependent on global context. Previous research on grammatical error correction typically uses pointwise prediction that performs classification on each word independently, and thus fails to capture the information of neighboring labels. In order to take global information into account, we regard the task as sequence labeling: each verb phrase in a document is labeled with tense/aspect depending on surrounding labels. Our experiments show that the global context makes a moderate con- tribution to tense/aspect error correction.</p><p>4 0.098246776 <a title="103-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Sentence_Dependency_Tagging_in_Online_Question_Answering_Forums.html">177 acl-2012-Sentence Dependency Tagging in Online Question Answering Forums</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhonghua Qu ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: Online forums are becoming a popular resource in the state of the art question answering (QA) systems. Because of its nature as an online community, it contains more updated knowledge than other places. However, going through tedious and redundant posts to look for answers could be very time consuming. Most prior work focused on extracting only question answering sentences from user conversations. In this paper, we introduce the task of sentence dependency tagging. Finding dependency structure can not only help find answer quickly but also allow users to trace back how the answer is concluded through user conversations. We use linear-chain conditional random fields (CRF) for sentence type tagging, and a 2D CRF to label the dependency relation between sentences. Our experimental results show that our proposed approach performs well for sentence dependency tagging. This dependency information can benefit other tasks such as thread ranking and answer summarization in online forums.</p><p>5 0.094158664 <a title="103-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-A_Meta_Learning_Approach_to_Grammatical_Error_Correction.html">15 acl-2012-A Meta Learning Approach to Grammatical Error Correction</a></p>

<p>Author: Yukino Baba ; Hisami Suzuki</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of spelling errors that are corrected as you type, vs. those that remain uncorrected. First, we generate naturally occurring online error correction data by logging usersâ€™ keystrokes, and by automatically deriving pre- and postcorrection strings from them. We then perform an analysis of this data against the errors that remain in the final text as well as across languages. Our analysis shows a clear distinction between the types of errors that are generated and those that remain uncorrected, as well as across languages.</p><p>4 0.49947432 <a title="103-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-Tense_and_Aspect_Error_Correction_for_ESL_Learners_Using_Global_Context.html">192 acl-2012-Tense and Aspect Error Correction for ESL Learners Using Global Context</a></p>

<p>Author: Hiroyuki Shindo ; Yusuke Miyao ; Akinori Fujino ; Masaaki Nagata</p><p>Abstract: We propose Symbol-Refined Tree Substitution Grammars (SR-TSGs) for syntactic parsing. An SR-TSG is an extension of the conventional TSG model where each nonterminal symbol can be refined (subcategorized) to fit the training data. We aim to provide a unified model where TSG rules and symbol refinement are learned from training data in a fully automatic and consistent fashion. We present a novel probabilistic SR-TSG model based on the hierarchical Pitman-Yor Process to encode backoff smoothing from a fine-grained SR-TSG to simpler CFG rules, and develop an efficient training method based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Our SR-TSG parser achieves an F1 score of 92.4% in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) English Penn Treebank parsing task, which is a 7.7 point improvement over a conventional Bayesian TSG parser, and better than state-of-the-art discriminative reranking parsers.</p><p>4 0.52489251 <a title="103-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-A_Ranking-based_Approach_to_Word_Reordering_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">19 acl-2012-A Ranking-based Approach to Word Reordering for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Nan Yang ; Mu Li ; Dongdong Zhang ; Nenghai Yu</p><p>Abstract: Long distance word reordering is a major challenge in statistical machine translation research. Previous work has shown using source syntactic trees is an effective way to tackle this problem between two languages with substantial word order difference. In this work, we further extend this line of exploration and propose a novel but simple approach, which utilizes a ranking model based on word order precedence in the target language to reposition nodes in the syntactic parse tree of a source sentence. The ranking model is automatically derived from word aligned parallel data with a syntactic parser for source language based on both lexical and syntactical features. We evaluated our approach on largescale Japanese-English and English-Japanese machine translation tasks, and show that it can significantly outperform the baseline phrase- based SMT system.</p><p>5 0.51774395 <a title="103-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Learning_to_Find_Translations_and_Transliterations_on_the_Web.html">134 acl-2012-Learning to Find Translations and Transliterations on the Web</a></p>

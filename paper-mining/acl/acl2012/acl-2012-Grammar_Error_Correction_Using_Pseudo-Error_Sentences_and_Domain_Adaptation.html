</p><p>3 We tackle this problem by using pseudoerror sentences generated automatically. [sent-10, score-0.214]
</p><p>4 Furthermore, we apply domain adaptation, the pseudo-error sentences are from the source domain, and the real-error sentences are from the target domain. [sent-11, score-0.504]
</p><p>5 Experiments show that stable improvement is achieved by using domain adaptation. [sent-12, score-0.31]
</p><p>6 1 Introduction Case marks of a sentence are represented by postpositional particles in Japanese. [sent-13, score-0.312]
</p><p>7 Incorrect usage of the  particles causes serious communication errors because the cases become unclear. [sent-14, score-0.391]
</p><p>8 arrive when delete please “When φ has arrived an e-mail, please delete it. [sent-17, score-0.39]
</p><p>9 ” If the accusative particle o is replaced by a nominative one ga, it becomes clear that the writer wants to delete the e-mail (“When the e-mail has arrived, please delete it. [sent-18, score-0.55]
</p><p>10 Such particle errors frequently occur in sentences written by non-native Japanese speakers. [sent-20, score-0.399]
</p><p>11 This paper presents a method that can automatically correct Japanese particle errors. [sent-21, score-0.297]
</p><p>12 This task 388 corresponds to preposition/article error correction in English. [sent-22, score-0.577]
</p><p>13 For English error correction, many studies employ classifiers, which select the appropriate prepositions/articles, by restricting the error types to articles and frequent prepositions (Gamon, 2010; Han et al. [sent-23, score-0.55]
</p><p>14 This approach can handle all error types by converting the learner’s sentences into the correct ones. [sent-27, score-0.436]
</p><p>15 Although the target of this paper is particle error, we employ a similar approach based on sequence conversion (Imamura et al. [sent-28, score-0.478]
</p><p>16 The conversion approach requires pairs of the learner’s and the correct sentences. [sent-30, score-0.184]
</p><p>17 To avoid this problem, we use additional corpus consisting of pseudo-error sentences automatically generated from correct sentences that mimic the realerrors (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010b). [sent-32, score-0.253]
</p><p>18 Furthermore, we apply a domain adaptation technique that regards the pseudo-errors and the real-errors as the source and the target domain, respectively, so that the pseudo-errors better match the real-errors. [sent-33, score-0.53]
</p><p>19 2  Error Correction by Discriminative Sequence Conversion  We start by describing discriminative sequence conversion. [sent-34, score-0.077]
</p><p>20 Our error correction method converts the  learner’s word sequences into the correct sequences. [sent-35, score-0.703]
</p><p>21 Our method is similar to phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT), but there are three differences; 1) it adopts the conditional random fields, 2) it allows insertion and deletion, and 3) binary and real features are combined. [sent-36, score-0.162]
</p><p>22 DS IUN UEBSL B  Table 1: Example of Phrase Table (partial)  approach, the conversion approach can correct multiple errors of all types in a sentence. [sent-41, score-0.263]
</p><p>23 1 Basic Procedure We apply the morpheme conversion approach that converts the results of a speech recognizer into word  sequences for language analyzer processing (Imamura et al. [sent-43, score-0.267]
</p><p>24 It corrects particle errors in the input sentences as follows. [sent-45, score-0.453]
</p><p>25 • First, all modification candidates are obtained by referring mtoo a phrase nta cbalne. [sent-46, score-0.101]
</p><p>26 d dTahtiess table, ctaail needd t bhey confusion set (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010a) in the error correction task, stores pairs of incorrect and correct particles (Table 1). [sent-47, score-1.19]
</p><p>27 The candidates are packed into a lattice structure, called the phrase lattice (Figure 1). [sent-48, score-0.228]
</p><p>28 To deal with unchanged words, it also copies the input words and inserts them into the phrase lattice. [sent-49, score-0.066]
</p><p>29 • Next, the best phrase sequence in the phrase lattNiceex tis, tihdeen bteisfietd p hbraasseed s on uthenec ceo nind tihtioen pahl rraasnedo lamtfields (CRFs (Lafferty et al. [sent-50, score-0.171]

</p><p>31 sFr coamrri tehde o alignment results, the phrase table is constructed by acquiring particle errors, and the CRF models are trained using the alignment results as supervised data. [sent-54, score-0.329]
</p><p>32 2  Insertion / Deletion  Since an insertion can be regarded as replacing an empty word with an actual word, and deletion is the replacement of an actual word with an empty one, we treat these operations as substitution without distinction while learning/applying the CRF models.

</p><p>34 tov de rob iPtAa rRa T Figure 1: Example of Phrase Lattice  However, insertion is a high cost operation because it may occur at any location and can cause lattice size to explode. [sent-60, score-0.2]
</p><p>35 To avoid this problem, we permit insertion only immediately after nouns. [sent-61, score-0.119]
</p><p>36 3 Features In this paper, we use mapping features and link features. [sent-63, score-0.043]
</p><p>37 The latter measure the fluency of the output word sequence (similar to language models). [sent-65, score-0.076]
</p><p>38 The focusing phrase and its two surrounding words of the input are regarded as the window. [sent-67, score-0.124]
</p><p>39 The mapping features are defined as the pairs of the output phrase and 1-, 2-, and 3-grams in the window. [sent-68, score-0.146]
</p><p>40 The link features are important for the error correction task because the system has to judge output correctness. [sent-69, score-0.657]
</p><p>41 Fortunately, CRF, which is a kind of discriminative model, can handle features that depend on each other; we mix two types of features as follows and optimize their weights in the CRF framework. [sent-70, score-0.16]
</p><p>42 Since the feature weights are optimized  •  considering the entire feature space, fine-tuning can be achieved. [sent-73, score-0.138]
</p><p>43 The accuracy becomes almost perfect on the training corpus. [sent-74, score-0.039]
</p><p>44 Language model probability: This is a logarithLmaicn gvuaalugee (real value) aofb itlhiety n-gram probability of the output word sequence. [sent-75, score-0.072]
</p><p>45 Incorporating binary and real features yields a rough approximation of generative models in semisupervised CRFs (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008). [sent-78, score-0.043]
</p><p>46 It can appropriately correct new sentences while maintaining high accuracy on the training corpus. [sent-79, score-0.161]
</p><p>47 3  Pseudo-error Sentences and Domain Adaptation  The error corrector described in Section 2 requires paired sentences. [sent-80, score-0.343]
</p><p>48 We resolve this problem by using pseudoerror sentences and domain adaptation. [sent-82, score-0.376]
</p><p>49 1 Pseudo-Error Generation Correct sentences, which are halves of the paired  sentences, can be easily acquired from corpora such as newspaper articles. [sent-84, score-0.138]
</p><p>50 Pseudo-errors are generated from them by the substitution, insertion, and deletion functions according to the desired error patterns. [sent-85, score-0.354]
</p><p>51 Namely, when particles appear in the correct sentence, they are replaced by incorrect ones in a probabilistic manner by applying the phrase table (which stores the error patterns) in the opposite direction. [sent-87, score-0.874]
</p><p>52 The error generation probabilities are relative frequencies on the training corpus. [sent-88, score-0.453]
</p><p>53 The models are learnt using both the training corpus and the pseudo-error sentences. [sent-89, score-0.05]
</p><p>54 2 Adaptation by Feature Augmentation Although the error generation probabilities are computed from the real-error corpus, the error distribution that results may be inappropriate. [sent-91, score-0.687]
</p><p>55 To better fit the pseudo-errors to the real-errors, we apply a domain adaptation technique. [sent-92, score-0.312]
</p><p>56 Namely, we regard the pseudo-error corpus as the source domain and the real-error corpus as the target domain, and models are learnt that fit the target domain. [sent-93, score-0.51]
</p><p>57 In this paper, we use Daume (2007)’s feature aug-  mentation method for the domain adaptation, which eliminates the need to change the learning algorithm. [sent-94, score-0.213]
</p><p>58 This method regards the models for the source domain as the prior distribution and learns the models for the target domain. [sent-95, score-0.38]

</p><p>60 The feature space is segmented into three parts: common, source, and target. [sent-97, score-0.087]
</p><p>61 The features extracted from the source domain data are deployed to the common and the source spaces, and those from the target domain data are deployed to the common and the target spaces. [sent-98, score-0.791]
</p><p>62 The parameter estimation is carried out in the usual way on the above feature space. [sent-100, score-0.051]
</p><p>63 Consequently, the weights of the common features are emphasized if the features are consistent between the source and the target. [sent-101, score-0.184]
</p><p>64 With regard to domain dependent features, the weights in the source or the target space are emphasized. [sent-102, score-0.436]
</p><p>65 Error correction uses only the features in the common and target spaces. [sent-103, score-0.441]
</p><p>66 The error distribution approaches that of the real-errors because the weights of features are optimized to the target domain. [sent-104, score-0.45]
</p><p>67 In addition, it becomes robust against new sentences because the common features acquired from the source domain can be used even when they do not appear in the target domain. [sent-105, score-0.529]
</p><p>68 1 Experimental Settings Real-error Corpus: We collected learner’s sentences written by Chinese native speakers. [sent-107, score-0.15]
</p><p>69 The sentences were created from English Linux manuals and figures, and Japanese native speakers revised them. [sent-108, score-0.21]
</p><p>70 From these sentences, only particle errors were retained; the other errors were corrected. [sent-109, score-0.386]
</p><p>71 As  a result, we obtained 2,770 paired sentences. [sent-110, score-0.068]
</p><p>72 Note that most particles did not need to be revised. [sent-113, score-0.312]
</p><p>73 The number of pair types of incorrect particles and their correct ones was 132. [sent-114, score-0.479]
</p><p>74 Pseudo-error Corpus: The pseudo-errors were generated using 10,000 sentences randomly selected from the corpus for the language model. [sent-124, score-0.092]
</p><p>75 The magnification of the error generation probabilities was changed from 0. [sent-125, score-0.534]
</p><p>76 0 (the relative frequency in the real-error corpus was taken as 1. [sent-129, score-0.041]
</p><p>77 We used two metrics: 1) Precision and recall rates of the error correction by the systems, and 2) Relative improvement, the number of differences between improved and degraded particles in the output sentences (no changes were ignored). [sent-132, score-1.054]
</p><p>78 This is a practical metric because it denotes the number of particles that human rewriters do not need to revise after the system correction. [sent-133, score-0.312]

</p><p>80 The feature augmentation was realized by regarding the pseudo-errors as the 391  Figure 4: Relative Improvement among Error Generation Probabilities  source domain and the real-errors as the target domain. [sent-140, score-0.501]
</p><p>81 The SRC case, which uses only the pseudo-error sentences, did not match the precision of TRG. [sent-141, score-0.038]
</p><p>82 The ALL case matched the precision of TRG at high recall rates. [sent-142, score-0.074]
</p><p>83 AUG, the proposed method, achieved higher precision than TRG at high recall rates. [sent-143, score-0.113]
</p><p>84 At the recall rate of 18%, the precision rate of AUG was 55. [sent-144, score-0.074]
</p><p>85 Feature augmentation effectively leverages the pseudoerrors for error correction. [sent-147, score-0.486]
</p><p>86 Figure 4 shows the relative improvement of each method according to the error generation probabilities. [sent-148, score-0.463]
</p><p>87 In this experiment, ALL achieved higher improvement than TRG at error generation probabilities ranging from 0. [sent-149, score-0.502]
</p><p>88 Although the improvements were high, we have to control the error generation probability because the improvements in the SRC case fell as the magnification was raised. [sent-152, score-0.493]
</p><p>89 On the other hand, AUG achieved stable improvement regardless of the error generation probability. [sent-153, score-0.563]
</p><p>90 We can conclude that domain adaptation to the pseudo-  error sentences is the preferred approach. [sent-154, score-0.679]
</p><p>91 5  Conclusions  This paper presented an error correction method of Japanese particles that uses pseudo-error generation. [sent-155, score-0.889]
</p><p>92 We applied domain adaptation in which the pseudoerrors are regarded as the source domain and the real-errors as the target domain. [sent-156, score-0.771]

<p>Author: Toshikazu Tajiri ; Mamoru Komachi ; Yuji Matsumoto</p><p>Abstract: As the number of learners of English is constantly growing, automatic error correction of ESL learners’ writing is an increasingly active area of research. However, most research has mainly focused on errors concerning articles and prepositions even though tense/aspect errors are also important. One of the main reasons why tense/aspect error correction is difficult is that the choice of tense/aspect is highly dependent on global context. Previous research on grammatical error correction typically uses pointwise prediction that performs classification on each word independently, and thus fails to capture the information of neighboring labels. In order to take global information into account, we regard the task as sequence labeling: each verb phrase in a document is labeled with tense/aspect depending on surrounding labels. Our experiments show that the global context makes a moderate con- tribution to tense/aspect error correction.</p><p>3 0.21328506 <a title="103-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Using_Rejuvenation_to_Improve_Particle_Filtering_for_Bayesian_Word_Segmentation.html">211 acl-2012-Using Rejuvenation to Improve Particle Filtering for Bayesian Word Segmentation</a></p>

First, we generate naturally occurring online error correction data by logging users’ keystrokes, and by automatically deriving pre- and postcorrection strings from them. We then perform an analysis of this data against the errors that remain in the final text as well as across languages. Our analysis shows a clear distinction between the types of errors that are generated and those that remain uncorrected, as well as across languages.</p><p>6 0.10085753 <a title="103-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-A_Corpus_of_Textual_Revisions_in_Second_Language_Writing.html">8 acl-2012-A Corpus of Textual Revisions in Second Language Writing</a></p>

The error correction task is hindered by the difficulty of collecting large error corpora. We tackle this problem by using pseudoerror sentences generated automatically. Furthermore, we apply domain adaptation, the pseudo-error sentences are from the source domain, and the real-error sentences are from the target domain. Experiments show that stable improvement is achieved by using domain adaptation.</p><p>2 0.78702915 <a title="103-lsi-2" href="./acl-2012-A_Meta_Learning_Approach_to_Grammatical_Error_Correction.html">15 acl-2012-A Meta Learning Approach to Grammatical Error Correction</a></p>

<p>Author: Toshikazu Tajiri ; Mamoru Komachi ; Yuji Matsumoto</p><p>Abstract: As the number of learners of English is constantly growing, automatic error correction of ESL learners’ writing is an increasingly active area of research. However, most research has mainly focused on errors concerning articles and prepositions even though tense/aspect errors are also important. One of the main reasons why tense/aspect error correction is difficult is that the choice of tense/aspect is highly dependent on global context. Previous research on grammatical error correction typically uses pointwise prediction that performs classification on each word independently, and thus fails to capture the information of neighboring labels. In order to take global information into account, we regard the task as sequence labeling: each verb phrase in a document is labeled with tense/aspect depending on surrounding labels. Our experiments show that the global context makes a moderate con- tribution to tense/aspect error correction.</p><p>4 0.69557136 <a title="103-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-How_Are_Spelling_Errors_Generated_and_Corrected%3F_A_Study_of_Corrected_and_Uncorrected_Spelling_Errors_Using_Keystroke_Logs.html">111 acl-2012-How Are Spelling Errors Generated and Corrected?

<p>Author: Viet-An Nguyen ; Jordan Boyd-Graber ; Philip Resnik</p><p>Abstract: One of the key tasks for analyzing conversational data is segmenting it into coherent topic segments. However, most models of topic segmentation ignore the social aspect of conversations, focusing only on the words used. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian nonparametric model, Speaker Identity for Topic Segmentation (SITS), that discovers (1) the topics used in a conversation, (2) how these topics are shared across conversations, (3) when these topics shift, and (4) a person-specific tendency to introduce new topics. We evaluate against current unsupervised segmentation models to show that including personspecific information improves segmentation performance on meeting corpora and on political debates. Moreover, we provide evidence that SITS captures an individual’s tendency to introduce new topics in political contexts, via analysis of the 2008 US presidential debates and the television program Crossfire. 1 Topic Segmentation as a Social Process Conversation, interactive discussion between two or more people, is one of the most essential and common forms of communication. Whether in an informal situation or in more formal settings such as a political debate or business meeting, a conversation is often not about just one thing: topics evolve and are replaced as the conversation unfolds. Discovering this hidden structure in conversations is a key problem for conversational assistants (Tur et al., 2010) and tools that summarize (Murray et al., 2005) and display (Ehlen et al., 2007) conversational data. Topic segmentation also can illuminate individuals’ agendas (Boydstun et al., 2011), patterns of agree- ment and disagreement (Hawes et al., 2009; Abbott 78 Jordan Boyd-Graber iSchool and UMIACS University of Maryland College Park, MD jbg@ umiac s .umd .edu Philip Resnik Department of Linguistics and UMIACS University of Maryland College Park, MD re snik @ umd .edu al., 2011), and relationships among conversational participants (Ireland et al., 2011). One of the most natural ways to capture conversational structure is topic segmentation (Reynar, 1998; Purver, 2011). Topic segmentation approaches range from simple heuristic methods based on lexical similarity (Morris and Hirst, 1991 ; Hearst, 1997) to more intricate generative models and supervised methods (Georgescul et al., 2006; Purver et al., 2006; Gruber et al., 2007; Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008), which have been shown to outperform the established heuristics. However, previous computational work on conversational structure, particularly in topic discovery and topic segmentation, focuses primarily on conet tent, ignoring the speakers. We argue that, because conversation is a social process, we can understand conversational phenomena better by explicitly modeling behaviors of conversational participants. In Section 2, we incorporate participant identity in a new model we call Speaker Identity for Topic Segmentation (SITS), which discovers topical structure in conversation while jointly incorporating a participantlevel social component. Specifically, we explicitly model an individual’s tendency to introduce a topic. After outlining inference in Section 3 and introducing data in Section 4, we use SITS to improve state-ofthe-art-topic segmentation and topic identification models in Section 5. In addition, in Section 6, we also show that the per-speaker model is able to discover individuals who shape and influence the course of a conversation. Finally, we discuss related work and conclude the paper in Section 7. 2 Modeling Multiparty Discussions Data Properties We are interested in turn-taking, multiparty discussion. This is a broad category, inProce Jedijung, sR oefpu thbeli c50 othf K Aonrneua,a8l -M14e Jtiunlgy o 2f0 t1h2e.

More formally, such datasets contain C conversations. A conversation c has Tc turns, each of which is a maximal uninterrupted utterance by one speaker.1 In each turn t ∈ [1, Tc], a speaker ac,t utters N words {wc,t,n}. Eatch ∈ w [1o,rTd is from a vocabulary of size V , {awnd th}ere are M distinct speakers. Modeling Approaches The key insight of topic segmentation is that segments evince lexical cohesion (Galley et al., 2003; Olney and Cai, 2005). Words within a segment will look more like their neighbors than other words. This insight has been used to tune supervised methods (Hsueh et al., 2006) and inspire unsupervised models of lexical cohesion using bags of words (Purver et al., 2006) and language models (Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008). We too take the unsupervised statistical approach. It requires few resources and is applicable in many domains without extensive training. Like previous approaches, we consider each turn to be a bag of words generated from an admixture of topics. Topics—after the topic modeling literature (Blei and Lafferty, 2009)—are multinomial distributions over terms. These topics are part of a generative model posited to have produced a corpus. However, topic models alone cannot model the dynamics of a conversation. Topic models typically do not model the temporal dynamics of individual documents, and those that do (Wang et al., 2008; Gerrish and Blei, 2010) are designed for larger documents and are not applicable here because they assume that most topics appear in every time slice. Instead, we endow each turn with a binary latent variable lc,t, called the topic shift. This latent variable signifies whether the speaker changed the topic of the conversation. To capture the topic-controlling behavior of the speakers across different conversations, we further associate each speaker m with a latent topic shift tendency, πm. Informally, this variable is intended to capture the propensity of a speaker to effect a topic shift. Formally, it represents the probability that the speaker m will change the topic (distribution) of a conversation. We take a Bayesian nonparametric approach (M¨uller and Quintana, 2004). Unlike 1Note the distinction with phonetic definition are bounded by silence. utterances, which by 79 parametric models, which a priori fix the number of topics, nonparametric models use a flexible number of topics to better represent data. Nonparametric distributions such as the Dirichlet process (Ferguson, 1973) share statistical strength among conversations using a hierarchical model, such as the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) (Teh et al., 2006). 2.1 Generative Process In this section, we develop SITS, a generative model of multiparty discourse that jointly discovers topics and speaker-specific topic shifts from an unannotated corpus (Figure 1a). As in the hierarchical Dirichlet process (Teh et al., 2006), we allow an unbounded number of topics to be shared among the turns of the corpus. Topics are drawn from a base distribution H over multinomial distributions over the vocabulary, a finite Dirichlet with symmetric prior λ. Unlike the HDP, where every document (here, every turn) draws a new multinomial distribution from a Dirichlet process, the social and temporal dynamics of a conversation, as specified by the binary topic shift indicator lc,t, determine when new draws happen. The full generative process is as follows: 1. For speaker m ∈ [1, M], draw speaker shift probability πm ∼ Beta(γ) 2. Draw∼ global probability measure G0 ∼ DP(α, H) 3. For each conversation c ∈ [1, C] (a) Draw conversation distribution Gc ∼ DP(α0 , G0) (b) For each turn t ∈ [1, Tc] with speaker ac,t i. If t = 1, set the topic shift lc,t = 1. Otherwise, draw lc,t ∼ Bernoulli(πac,t ). ii. If lc,t = 1∼, d Breawrn Gc,t ∼ DP(αc, Gc). Otherwise, set Gc,t ≡ Gc,t−1 . iii. For each word ≡ind Gex n ∈ [1, Nc,t] • Draw ψc,t,n ∼ Gc,t • DDrraaww wc,t,n ∼ Multinomial(ψc,t,n) The hierarchy of Dirichlet processes allows statistical strength to be shared across contexts; within a conversation and across conversations. The perspeaker topic shift tendency πm allows speaker identity to influence the evolution of topics. To make notation concrete and aligned with the topic segmentation, we introduce notation for segments in a conversation. A segment s of conversation c is a sequence of turns [τ, τ0] such that lc,τ = lc,τ0+1 = 1and lc,t = 0, ∀t ∈ (τ, τ0] . When lc,t = 0, Gc,t is the same =Gc 0,t,−∀1t a ∈nd ( aτ,llτ τtopics (i.e. multinomial distributions over words) {ψc,t,n} that generate words in turn t and the topics{ ψ{ψc,t}−1,n} that generate words in turn t −1 come from{ψ ψthc,et −s1a,mn}e as Figure 1: Graphical model representations of our proposed models: (a) the nonparametric version; (b) the parametric version. Nodes represent random variables (shaded ones are observed), lines are probabilistic dependencies. Plates represent repetition. The innermost plates are turns, grouped in conversations. distribution. Thus all topics used in a segment s are drawn from a single distribution, Gc,s, , , , Gc,s | lc,1 lc,2 · · · lc,Tc , αc, Gc ∼ DP(αc, Gc) (1) For notational convenience, Sc denotes the number of segments in conversation c, and st denotes the segment index of turn t. We emphasize that all segment-related notations are derived from the posterior over the topic shifts land not part of the model itself. Parametric Version SITS is a generalization of a parametric model (Figure 1b) where each turn has a multinomial distribution over K topics. In the parametric case, the number of topics K is fixed. Each topic, as before, is a multinomial distribution φ1 . . . φK. In the parametric case, each turn t in conversation c has an explicit multinomial distribution over K topics θc,t, identical for turns within a segment. A new topic distribution θ is drawn from a Dirichlet distribution parameterized by α when the topic shift indicator lis 1. The parametric version does not share strength within or across conversations, unlike SITS. When applied on a single conversation without speaker identity (all speakers are identical) it is equivalent to (Purver et al., 2006). In our experiments (Section 5), we compare against both. 80 3 Inference To find the latent variables that best explain observed data, we use Gibbs sampling, a widely used Markov chain Monte Carlo inference technique (Neal, 2000; Resnik and Hardisty, 2010). The state space is latent variables for topic indices assigned to all tokens z = {zc,t,n} and topic shifts assigned to turns l= {lc,t}. {Wze marginalize over all other latent variablle =s. Here, we only present the conditional sampling equations; for more details, see our supplement.2 3.1 Sampling Topic Assignments To sample zc,t,n, the index of the shared topic assigned to token n of turn t in conversation c, we need to sample the path assigning each word token to a segment-specific topic, each segment-specific topic to a conversational topic and each conversational topic to a shared topic. For efficiency, we make use of the minimal path assumption (Wallach, 2008) to generate these assignments.3 Under the minimal path assumption, an observation is assumed to have been generated by using a new distribution if and only if there is no existing distribution with the same value. 2 http://www.cs.umd.edu/∼vietan/topicshift/appendix.pdf 3We also investigated using the maximal assumption and fully sampling assignments. We found the minimal path assumption worked as well as explicitly sampling seating assignments and that the maximal path assumption worked less well. We use Nc,s,k to denote the number of tokens in segment s in conversation c assigned topic k; Nc,k denotes the total number of segment-specific topics in conversation c assigned topic k and Nk denotes the number of conversational topics assigned topic k. TWk,w denotes the number of times the shared topic k is assigned to word w in the vocabulary. Marginal counts are represented with · and ∗ represents all hyperparameters. The condit·ional d∗istribution for zc,t,n is P(zc,t,n = k | wc,t,n = w, z−c,t,n, w−c,t,n, l, ∗) ∝ Nc−,sct ,kn+αNc −c,s−ct,kct·,n Nn+c −,·αc ,t0cnN +k−· αc,t0 ,n + αK ×  VT1 W k−, ·c,wctk, n e+w V.λ( 2), Here V is the size of the vocabulary, K is the current number of shared topics and the superscript −c,t,n denotes counts without considering wc,t,n. In Equation 2, the first factor is proportional to the probability of sampling a path according to the minimal path assumption; the second factor is proportional to the likelihood of observing w given the sampled topic. Since an uninformed prior is used, when a new topic is sampled, all tokens are equiprobable. 3.2 Sampling Topic Shifts Sampling the topic shift variable lc,t requires us to consider merging or splitting segments. We use kc,t to denote the shared topic indices of all tokens in turn t of conversation c; Sac,t,x to denote the number of times speaker ac,t is assigned the topic shift with value x ∈ {0, 1}; Jcx,s to denote the number of topics in segment s 1o}f conversation c if lc,t = x and Ncx,s,j to denote the number of tokens assigned to the segment-specific topic j when lc,t = x.4 Again, the superscript −c,t is used to denote exclusion of turn t of conversation c in the corresponding counts. Recall that the topic shift is a binary variable. We use 0 to represent the case that the topic distribution is identical to the previous turn. We sample this assignment P(lc,t = 0 | l−c,t, w, k, a, ∗) ∝ SSa−a−cc,c,ct,t , t·,0++ 2 γγ×αcJ0c,sNtx=Qc01,sjJt=c,0·,1s(tx(N −c0 1,s +t,j α−c) 1)!. (3) 4Deterministically knowQing the path assignments is the primary efficiency motivation for using the minimal path assumption. The alternative is to explicitly sample the path assignments, which is more complicated (for both notation and computation). This option is spelled in full detail in the supplementary material. 81 In Equation 3, the first factor is proportional to the probability of assigning a topic shift of value 0 to speaker ac,t and the second factor is proportional to the joint probability of all topics in segment st of conversation c when lc,t = 0. The other alternative is for the topic shift to be 1, which represents the introduction of a new distri- bution over topics inside an existing segment. We sample this as P(lc,t = 1 | l−c,t, w, k, a, ∗) ∝ S −a −c ,c t, t, t, ·1+ 2 γ ×αcJc1,(st−1x)NQ=c1,1(jJs=ct1−,1(s1t)−,·1()x(N −c1 1,( +st− α1c) ,j− 1)! αcJcQ1,sNxt=c1Q1,stJj,c=1·,(s1xt( −N 1c1, +stj α−c) 1)!. (4) As above, the first faQctor in Equation 4 is proportional to the probability of assigning a topic shift of value 1to speaker ac,t; the second factor in the big bracket is proportional to the joint distribution of the topics in segments st − 1 and st. In this case lc,t = 1 means splitting the current segment, which results in two joint probabilities for two segments. 4 Datasets This section introduces the three corpora we use. We preprocess the data to remove stopwords and remove turns containing fewer than five tokens. The ICSI Meeting Corpus: The ICSI Meeting Corpus (Janin et al., 2003) is 75 transcribed meetings. For evaluation, we used a standard set of reference segmentations (Galley et al., 2003) of 25 meetings. Segmentations are binary, i.e., each point of the document is either a segment boundary or not, and on average each meeting has 8 segment boundaries. After preprocessing, there are 60 unique speakers and the vocabulary contains 3346 non-stopword tokens. The 2008 Presidential Election Debates Our second dataset contains three annotated presidential debates (Boydstun et al., 2011) between Barack Obama and John McCain and a vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin. Each turn is one of two types: questions (Q) from the moderator or responses (R) from a candidate. Each clause in a turn is coded with a Question Topic (TQ) and a Response Topic (TR). Thus, a turn has a list of TQ’s and TR’s both of length equal to the number of clauses in the turn. Topics are from the Policy Agendas Topics SpeakerTypeTurn clausesTQTR BrokawQbSeenfo.r Oeib ta gmeat,s [b.e.t.t]er A arned yo thuey sa oyuingght [. to. b]e th parte tphaere Adm foerri tchaant? economy is going to get much worse1N/A ObamaR[hN.o .m,.]e Is B a,um mtac mokenofs itdu iermenpt o ahrabt oaun th tel yt ,h we c Aaen’rm epea gryoic ithnangei e trco bo hinlaosvm e[.y t. o. h]elp ordinary familes be able to stay in their1 1 4 BrokawQSen.

The topics (TQ and TR) are from the Policy Agendas Topics Codebook which contains the following codes of topic: Macroeconomics Community Development (14), Government Operations (20). (1), Housing & Codebook, a manual inventory of 19 major topics and 225 subtopics.5 Table 1 shows an example annotation. To get reference segmentations, we assign each turn a real value from 0 to 1indicating how much a turn changes the topic. For a question-typed turn, the score is the fraction of clause topics not appearing in the previous turn; for response-typed turns, the score is the fraction of clause topics that do not appear in the corresponding question. This results in a set of non-binary reference segmentations. For evaluation metrics that require binary segmentations, we create a binary segmentation by setting a turn as a segment boundary if the computed score is 1. This threshold is chosen to include only true segment boundaries. CNN’s Crossfire Crossfire was a weekly U.S. television “talking heads” program engineered to incite heated arguments (hence the name). Each episode features two recurring hosts, two guests, and clips from the week’s news. Our Crossfire dataset contains 1134 transcribed episodes aired between 2000 and 2004.6 There are 2567 unique speakers. Unlike the previous two datasets, Crossfire does not have explicit topic segmentations, so we use it to explore speaker-specific characteristics (Section 6). 5 Topic Segmentation Experiments In this section, we examine how well SITS can replicate annotations of when new topics are introduced. 5 http://www.policyagendas.org/page/topic-codebook 6 http://www.cs.umd.edu/∼vietan/topicshift/crossfire.zip 82 We discuss metrics for evaluating an algorithm’s segmentation against a gold annotation, describe our experimental setup, and report those results. Evaluation Metrics To evaluate segmentations, we use Pk (Beeferman et al., 1999) and WindowDiff (WD) (Pevzner and Hearst, 2002). Both metrics measure the probability that two points in a document will be incorrectly separated by a segment boundary. Both techniques consider all spans of length k in the document and count whether the two endpoints of the window are (im)properly segmented against the gold segmentation. However, these metrics have drawbacks. First, they require both hypothesized and reference segmentations to be binary. Many algorithms (e.g., probabilistic approaches) give non-binary segmentations where candidate boundaries have real-valued scores (e.g., probability or confidence). Thus, evaluation requires arbitrary thresholding to binarize soft scores. To be fair, thresholds are set so the number of segments are equal to a predefined value (Purver et al., 2006; Galley et al., 2003). To overcome these limitations, we also use Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) (Rubner et al., 2000), a metric that measures the distance between two distributions. The EMD is the minimal cost to transform one distribution into the other. Each segmentation can be considered a multi-dimensional distribution where each candidate boundary is a dimension. In EMD, a distance function across features allows partial credit for “near miss” segment boundaries. In addition, because EMD operates on distributions, we can compute the distance between non-binary hypothesized segmentations with binary or real-valued reference segmentations. We use the FastEMD implementation (Pele and Werman, 2009). Experimental Methods We applied the following methods to discover topic segmentations in a document: • TextTiling (Hearst, 1997) is one of the earliest generalpurpose topic segmentation algorithms, sliding a fixedwidth window to detect major changes in lexical similarity. • P-NoSpeaker-S: parametric version without speaker identity run on keaerc-hS conversation (Purver et al., 2006) • P-NoSpeaker-M: parametric version without speaker identity run on Mall conversations • P-SITS: the parametric version of SITS with speaker identity run on all conversations • NP-HMM: the HMM-based nonparametric model which a single topic per turn. This model can be considered a Sticky HDP-HMM (Fox et al., 2008) with speaker identity. • NP-SITS: the nonparametric version of SITS with speaker identity run on all conversations. Parameter Settings and Implementations experiment, all parameters same as in (Hearst, 1997). of TextTiling In our are the For statistical models, Gibbs sampling with 10 randomly initialized chains is used. Initial hyperparameter values are sampled from U(0, 1) to favor sparsity; statistics are collected after 500 burn-in iterations with a lag of 25 iterations over a total of 5000 iterations; and slice sampling (Neal, 2003) optimizes hyperparameters. Results and Analysis Table 2 shows the perfor- mance of various models on the topic segmentation problem, using the ICSI corpus and the 2008 debates. Consistent with previous results, probabilistic models outperform TextTiling. In addition, among the probabilistic models, the models that had access to speaker information consistently segment better than those lacking such information, supporting our assertion that there is benefit to modeling conversation as a social process. Furthermore, NP-SITS outperforms NP-HMM in both experiments, suggesting that using a distribution over topics to turns is better than using a single topic. This is consistent with parametric results reported in (Purver et al., 2006). The contribution of speaker identity seems more valuable in the debate setting. Debates are characterized by strong rewards for setting the agenda; dodging a question or moving the debate toward an oppo83 nent’s weakness can be useful strategies (Boydstun et al., 2011). In contrast, meetings (particularly lowstakes ICSI meetings) are characterized by pragmatic rather than strategic topic shifts. Second, agendasetting roles are clearer in formal debates; a modera- tor is tasked with setting the agenda and ensuring the conversation does not wander too much. The nonparametric model does best on the smaller debate dataset. We suspect that an evaluation that directly accessed the topic quality, either via prediction (Teh et al., 2006) or interpretability (Chang et al., 2009) would favor the nonparametric model more. 6 Evaluating Topic Shift Tendency In this section, we focus on the ability of SITS to capture speaker-level attributes. Recall that SITS associates with each speaker a topic shift tendency π that represents the probability of asserting a new topic in the conversation. While topic segmentation is a well studied problem, there are no established quantitative measurements of an individual’s ability to control a conversation. To evaluate whether the tendency is capturing meaningful characteristics of speakers, we compare our inferred tendencies against insights from political science. 2008 Elections To obtain a posterior estimate of π (Figure 3) we create 10 chains with hyperparameters sampled from the uniform distribution U(0, 1) and averaged π over 10 chains (as described in Section 5). In these debates, Ifill is the moderator of the debate between Biden and Palin; Brokaw, Lehrer and Schieffer are the three moderators of three debates between Obama and McCain. Here “Question” denotes questions from audiences in “town hall” debate. The role of this “speaker” can be considered equivalent to the debate moderator. The topic shift tendencies of moderators are much higher than for candidates. In the three debates between Obama and McCain, the moderators— Brokaw, Lehrer and Schieffer—have significantly higher scores than both candidates. This is a useful reality check, since in a debate the moderators are the ones asking questions and literally controlling the topical focus. Interestingly, in the vice-presidential debate, the score of moderator Ifill is only slightly higher than those of Palin and Biden; this is consistent with media commentary characterizing her as a size of the metrics Pk and WindowDiff chosen to replicate previous results. weak moderator.7 Similarly, the “Question” speaker had a relatively high variance, consistent with an amalgamation of many distinct speakers. These topic shift tendencies suggest that all candidates manage to succeed at some points in setting and controlling the debate topics. Our model gives Obama a slightly higher score than McCain, consistent with social science claims (Boydstun et al., 2011) that Obama had the lead in setting the agenda over McCain. Table 4 shows of SITS-detected topic shifts. Crossfire Crossfire, unlike the debates, has many speakers. This allows us to examine more closely what we can learn about speakers’ topic shift tendency. We verified that SITS can segment topics, and assuming that changing the topic is useful for a speaker, how can we characterize who does so effectively? We examine the relationship between topic shift tendency, social roles, and political ideology. To focus on frequent speakers, we filter out speakers with fewer than 30 turns. Most speakers have relatively small π, with the mode around 0.3. There are, however, speakers with very high topic shift tendencies. Table 5 shows the speakers having the highest values according to SITS. We find that there are three general patterns for who influences the course of a conversation in Crossfire. First, there are structural “speakers” the show uses to frame and propose new topics. These are 7 http://harpers.org/archive/2008/10/hbc-90003659 84 2008 Presidential Election Debates (larger means greater tendency) audience questions, news clips (e.g. many of Gore’s and Bush’s turns from 2000), and voice overs. That SITS is able to recover these is reassuring. Second, the stable of regular hosts receives high topic shift tendencies, which is reasonable given their experience with the format and ostensible moderation roles (in practice they also stoke lively discussion). The remaining class is more interesting. The remaining non-hosts with high topic shift tendency are relative moderates on the political spectrum: • John Kasich, one of few Republicans to support the assault weapons ban and now governor of Ohio, a swing state • Christine Todd Whitman, former Republican governor of CNehrwis Jersey, a very iDtmemano,c froartmice srt Ratee • John McCain, who before 2008 was known as a “maverick” for working with Democrats (e.g. Russ Feingold) This suggests that, despite Crossfire’s tendency to create highly partisan debates, those who are able to work across the political spectrum may best be able to influence the topic under discussion in highly polarized contexts. Table 4 shows detected topic shifts from these speakers; two of these examples (McCain and Whitman) show disagreement of Republicans with President Bush. In the other, Kasich is defending a Republican plan (school vouchers) popular with traditional Democratic constituencies. 7 Related and Future Work In the realm of statistical models, a number of techniques incorporate social connections and identity to explain content in social networks (Chang and Blei, atsbDePMmwphIncFiAoasCrtuLleycnNdAg:irIs’SatYphyo,weumckItGrasy’.qoheivfnuIakgrsdt?heo vna,dtbpJ.omslrheyivcaBnwdspeur[.ihodqtef]nuar,slihmetdnyuaopi’s-SbeI[hBn.FCtDvHLcr]ligEemIhysNoa:nFbvWidxeAltEsghnmRboad:eics[yr.,fmtuwleinha][go.,dLYftweur]–’lhsdaitngxerkbIfoat.hqeslkOufinrmbtyoeha,rit[n.geholyasc]rdi,wteoaxylpm’sburneItaopfkvicsqr.,n[BYoOtafebxruli.,mcEksGgatvn]roOebpyitmlnorcd.ea[sfviPYtr]lgoandyu., Previous turnTurn detected as shifting topic examples of those with high topic shift tendency 238947156FPAGNQMreouna.mlvsWea†‡kt.iluBonrcseh‡.7586 41702 4863150FBCKWMealchgrsitCvA lamuhoin†efr.5 2473509 π.

Apart from those groups, speakers with the highest tendency were political moderates. 2009) and scientific corpora (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004). However, these models ignore the temporal evolution of content, treating documents as static. Models that do investigate the evolution of topics over time typically ignore the identify of the speaker. For example: models having sticky topics over ngrams (Johnson, 2010), sticky HDP-HMM (Fox et al., 2008); models that are an amalgam of sequential models and topic models (Griffiths et al., 2005; Wal85 lach, 2006; Gruber et al., 2007; Ahmed and Xing, 2008; Boyd-Graber and Blei, 2008; Du et al., 2010); or explicit models of time or other relevant features as a distinct latent variable (Wang and McCallum, 2006; Eisenstein et al., 2010). In contrast, SITS jointly models topic and individuals’ tendency to control a conversation. Not only does SITS outperform other models using standard computational linguistics baselines, but it also pro- poses intriguing hypotheses for social scientists. Associating each speaker with a scalar that models their tendency to change the topic does improve performance on standard tasks, but it’s inadequate to fully describe an individual. Modeling individuals’ perspective (Paul and Girju, 2010), “side” (Thomas et al., 2006), or personal preferences for topics (Grimmer, 2009) would enrich the model and better illuminate the interaction of influence and topic. Statistical analysis of political discourse can help discover patterns that political scientists, who often work via a “close reading,” might otherwise miss. We plan to work with social scientists to validate our implicit hypothesis that our topic shift tendency correlates well with intuitive measures of “influence.” Acknowledgements This research was funded in part by the Army Research Laboratory through ARL Cooperative Agreement W91 1NF-09-2-0072 and by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), through the Army Research Laboratory.

<p>Author: Mark Johnson ; Katherine Demuth ; Michael Frank</p><p>Abstract: This paper uses an unsupervised model of grounded language acquisition to study the role that social cues play in language acquisition. The input to the model consists of (orthographically transcribed) child-directed utterances accompanied by the set of objects present in the non-linguistic context. Each object is annotated by social cues, indicating e.g., whether the caregiver is looking at or touching the object. We show how to model the task of inferring which objects are being talked about (and which words refer to which objects) as standard grammatical inference, and describe PCFG-based unigram models and adaptor grammar-based collocation models for the task. Exploiting social cues improves the performance of all models. Our models learn the relative importance of each social cue jointly with word-object mappings and collocation structure, consis- tent with the idea that children could discover the importance of particular social information sources during word learning.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.79604512 <a title="103-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Grammar_Error_Correction_Using_Pseudo-Error_Sentences_and_Domain_Adaptation.html">103 acl-2012-Grammar Error Correction Using Pseudo-Error Sentences and Domain Adaptation</a></p>

The error correction task is hindered by the difficulty of collecting large error corpora. We tackle this problem by using pseudoerror sentences generated automatically. Furthermore, we apply domain adaptation, the pseudo-error sentences are from the source domain, and the real-error sentences are from the target domain. Experiments show that stable improvement is achieved by using domain adaptation.</p><p>4 0.65488183 <a title="103-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-PORT%3A_a_Precision-Order-Recall_MT_Evaluation_Metric_for_Tuning.html">158 acl-2012-PORT: a Precision-Order-Recall MT Evaluation Metric for Tuning</a></p>
<p>Author: Boxing Chen ; Roland Kuhn ; Samuel Larkin</p><p>Abstract: Many machine translation (MT) evaluation metrics have been shown to correlate better with human judgment than BLEU. In principle, tuning on these metrics should yield better systems than tuning on BLEU. However, due to issues such as speed, requirements for linguistic resources, and optimization difficulty, they have not been widely adopted for tuning. This paper presents PORT , a new MT evaluation metric which combines precision, recall and an ordering metric and which is primarily designed for tuning MT systems. PORT does not require external resources and is quick to compute. It has a better correlation with human judgment than BLEU. We compare PORT-tuned MT systems to BLEU-tuned baselines in five experimental conditions involving four language pairs. PORT tuning achieves 1 consistently better performance than BLEU tuning, according to four automated metrics (including BLEU) and to human evaluation: in comparisons of outputs from 300 source sentences, human judges preferred the PORT-tuned output 45.3% of the time (vs. 32.7% BLEU tuning preferences and 22.0% ties). 1</p><p>5 0.63987827 <a title="103-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Joint_Feature_Selection_in_Distributed_Stochastic_Learning_for_Large-Scale_Discriminative_Training_in_SMT.html">123 acl-2012-Joint Feature Selection in Distributed Stochastic Learning for Large-Scale Discriminative Training in SMT</a></p>

Evidence from machine learning indicates that increasing the training sample size results in better prediction. The goal of this paper is to show that this common wisdom can also be brought to bear upon SMT. We deploy local features for SCFG-based SMT that can be read off from rules at runtime, and present a learning algorithm that applies ‘1/‘2 regularization for joint feature selection over distributed stochastic learning processes. We present experiments on learning on 1.5 million training sentences, and show significant improvements over tuning discriminative models on small development sets.</p><p>6 0.63962865 <a title="103-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Machine_Translation_without_Words_through_Substring_Alignment.html">140 acl-2012-Machine Translation without Words through Substring Alignment</a></p>

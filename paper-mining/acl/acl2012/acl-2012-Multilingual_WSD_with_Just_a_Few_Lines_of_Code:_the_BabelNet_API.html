</p><p>2 it ,  Abstract In this paper we present an API for programmatic access to BabelNet a wide-coverage multilingual lexical knowledge base and multilingual knowledge-rich Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). [sent-3, score-0.657]
</p><p>3 Our aim is to provide the research community with easy-to-use tools to perform multilingual lexical semantic analysis and foster further research in this direction. [sent-4, score-0.359]
</p><p>4 While the lack of resources has hampered the development of effective multilingual approaches to WSD, recently this idea has been revamped with the organization of SemEval tasks on cross-lingual WSD (Lefever and Hoste, 2010) and cross-lingual lexical substitution (Mihalcea et al. [sent-9, score-0.264]
</p><p>5 In addition, new research on 67 the topic has explored the translation of sentences into many languages (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010; Lefever et al. [sent-11, score-0.026]
</p><p>6 , 2011; Banea and Mihalcea, 2011), as well as the projection of monolingual knowledge onto another language (Khapra et al. [sent-12, score-0.037]
</p><p>7 In our research we focus on knowledge-based  methods and tools for multilingual WSD, since knowledge-rich WSD has been shown to achieve high performance across domains (Agirre et al. [sent-14, score-0.258]
</p><p>8 , 2011) and to compete with supervised methods on a variety oflexical disambiguation tasks (Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010). [sent-16, score-0.145]
</p><p>9 Our vision of knowledge-rich multilingual WSD requires two fundamental components: first, a wide-coverage multilingual lexical knowledge base; second, tools to effectively query, retrieve and exploit its information for disambiguation. [sent-17, score-0.559]
</p><p>10 Nevertheless, to date, no integrated resources and tools exist that are freely available to the research community on a multilingual scale. [sent-18, score-0.284]
</p><p>11 Previous endeavors are either not freely available (EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998)), or are only accessible via a Web interface (cf. [sent-19, score-0.062]
</p><p>12 , 2004) and MENTA (de Melo and Weikum, 2010)), thus providing no programmatic access. [sent-21, score-0.055]
</p><p>13 And this is despite the fact that the availability of easy-to-use libraries for efficient information access is known to foster top-level research cf. [sent-22, score-0.07]

</p><p>17 , concepts and semantic relations) levels; (b) an API to perform graph-based WSD with BabelNet, thus providing, for the first time, a freely-available toolkit for performing knowledge-based WSD in a multilingual and cross-lingual setting. [sent-39, score-0.371]
</p><p>18 2  BabelNet  BabelNet follows the structure of a traditional lex-  ical knowledge base and accordingly consists of a labeled directed graph where nodes represent concepts and named entities and edges express semantic relations between them. [sent-40, score-0.289]
</p><p>19 Concepts and relations are harvested from the largest available semantic lexicon of English, i. [sent-41, score-0.149]
</p><p>20 , Wikipedia1 , thus making BabelNet a multilingual ‘encyclopedic dictionary’ which automatically integrates fine-grained lexicographic information with large amounts of encyclopedic knowledge by means of a high-performing mapping algorithm (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010). [sent-45, score-0.409]
</p><p>21 In addition to this conceptual backbone, BabelNet provides a multilingual lexical dimension. [sent-46, score-0.309]
</p><p>22 Each of its nodes, called Babel synsets, contains a set of lexicalizations of the concept for different languages, e. [sent-47, score-0.042]
</p><p>23 An excerpt of the entry for the Babel synset containing bankn2 is shown in Figure 12. [sent-54, score-0.153]
</p><p>24 sense  of  a  word w  68 tion of WordNet and Wikipedia); (c) the corresponding (possibly empty) WordNet 3. [sent-60, score-0.112]
</p><p>25 0 synset offset ; (d) the number of sense s in all languages and their full listing; (e) the number of translation relations and their full listing; (f) the number of semantic pointers (i. [sent-61, score-0.423]
</p><p>26 , relations) to other Babel synsets and their full listing. [sent-63, score-0.081]
</p><p>27 , whether they come from WordNet (WN), Wikipedia pages (WIKI) or their redirections (WIKIRED), or are automatic translations (WNTR / WIKI TR) and about their language and lemma. [sent-66, score-0.044]
</p><p>28 In addition, translation relations among lexical items are represented as a mapping from source to target senses e. [sent-67, score-0.168]
</p><p>29 , 2 3 4 9 means that the second element in the list of senses (the English word bank) translates into items #3 (German Bank), #4 (Italian banca), and #9 (French banque). [sent-69, score-0.083]
</p><p>30 Finally, semantic relations are encoded using WordNet’s pointers and an additional sym–  –  –  , ,  bol for Wikipedia relations (r), which can also specify the source of the relation (e. [sent-70, score-0.17]
</p><p>31 , FROM I T means that the relation was harvested from the Italian Wikipedia). [sent-72, score-0.051]
</p><p>32 In Figure 1, the Babel synset inherits the WordNet hypernym (@) relation to financial institutionn1 (offset bn : 0 0 0 3 4 5 3 7n), as well as Wikipedia relations to the synsets of FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT (bn : 02 94 52 4 6n) and ETHICAL BANKING (bn : 0 2 8 5 4 8 8 4 n, from Italian). [sent-73, score-0.343]
</p><p>33 BabelNet can be effectively accessed and automatically embedded within applications by means of a programmatic access. [sent-75, score-0.055]
</p><p>34 In order to achieve this, we developed a Java API, based on Apache Lucene3, which indexes the BabelNet textual dump and includes a variety of methods to access the four main levels of information encoded in BabelNet, namely: (a) lexicographic (information about word senses), (b) encyclopedic (i. [sent-76, score-0.195]
</p><p>35 tities), (c) conceptual (the semantic network made up of its concepts), (d) and multilingual level (information about word translations). [sent-81, score-0.322]
</p><p>36 In the code snippet we start by querying the Babel synsets for the English word bank (line 3). [sent-83, score-0.156]
</p><p>37 Then, we access and print the Italian word senses they contain (lines 8–10), and finally –  the synsets they are related to (lines 11–19). [sent-85, score-0.244]
</p><p>38 Thanks to carefully designed Java classes, we are able to accomplish all of this in about 20 lines of code. [sent-86, score-0.057]
</p><p>39 At its core, the API leverages an in-house Java library to query paths and create semantic graphs with BabelNet. [sent-89, score-0.147]
</p><p>40 Next, these paths are stored within a Lucene index, –  which ensures efficient lookups for querying those paths starting and ending in a specific synset. [sent-91, score-0.162]
</p><p>41 Given a set of words as input, a semantic graph factory class searches for their meanings within BabelNet, looks for their connecting paths, and merges such paths within a single graph. [sent-92, score-0.234]
</p><p>42 Optionally, the paths making up the graph can be filtered e. [sent-93, score-0.122]
</p><p>43 and the graph nodes can be scored using a variety of methods such as, for instance, their outdegree or PageRank value in the context of the semantic graph. [sent-96, score-0.149]
</p><p>44 These graph connectivity measures can be used to rank senses of the input words, thus performing graph-based WSD on the basis of the structure of the underlying knowledge base. [sent-97, score-0.265]
</p><p>45 –  –  –  We show in Figure 3 a usage disambiguation API. [sent-98, score-0.118]

</p><p>47 KnowledgeBase is an enumeration of supported knowledge bases: currently, it includes BabelNet, as well as WordNet++ (namely, an English WordNet-based subset ofit (Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010)) and WordNet. [sent-107, score-0.068]
</p><p>48 In the snippet we start in line 3 by obtaining an instance of the factory class which creates the semantic graphs for a given knowledge base. [sent-109, score-0.175]
</p><p>49 Next, we use this factory to create the graph for the input words (line 4). [sent-110, score-0.113]
</p><p>50 We then score the senses ofthe input words occurring within this graph (line 5–10). [sent-111, score-0.141]
</p><p>51 Finally, we output the sense distributions of each word in lines 11–18. [sent-112, score-0.169]
</p><p>52 4  Experiments  We benchmark our API by performing knowledgebased WSD with BabelNet on standard SemEval datasets, namely the SemEval-2007 coarse-grained all-words (Navigli et al. [sent-116, score-0.077]
</p><p>53 For both experimental settings we use a standard graphbased algorithm, Degree (Navigli and Lapata, 2010), which has been previously shown to yield a highly competitive performance on different lexical disambiguation tasks (Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010). [sent-118, score-0.162]
</p><p>54 Given a semantic graph for the input context, Degree selects the sense of the target word with the highest vertex degree. [sent-119, score-0.227]
</p><p>55 Since the selected Babel synset can contain multiple translations in a target language for the given English word, we use for this task an  AlgorithmNouns onlyAll words  SNUUSSS-XPT-FR8812. [sent-121, score-0.125]
</p><p>56 Tables 1 and 2 summarize our results in terms of recall (the primary metric for WSD tasks): for each SemEval task, we benchmark our disambiguation API against the best unsupervised and supervised systems, namely SUSSX-FR (Koeling and McCarthy, 2007) and NUS-PT (Chan et al. [sent-134, score-0.186]
</p><p>57 In the Coarse-WSD task our API achieves the best overall performance on the nouns-only subset of the data, thus supporting previous findings indicating the benefits of using rich knowledge bases like BabelNet. [sent-136, score-0.079]
</p><p>58 In the CL-WSD evaluation, instead, using BabelNet allows us to surpass the best unsupervised system by a substantial margin, thus indicating the viability of high-performing WSD with a multilingual lexical knowledge base. [sent-137, score-0.301]
</p><p>59 While our performance still lags behind the application of supervised techniques to this task (cf. [sent-138, score-0.027]
</p><p>60 also results from Lefever  and Hoste (2010)), we argue that further improvements can still be obtained by exploiting more complex disambiguation strategies. [sent-139, score-0.118]
</p><p>61 5  Related Work  Our work complements recent efforts focused on visual browsing of wide-coverage knowledge bases (Tylenda et al. [sent-141, score-0.116]

</p><p>63 In comparison with other contributions, our toolkit for multilingual WSD takes previous work from Navigli (2006), in which an online interface for graph-based monolingual WSD is presented, one step further by adding a multilingual dimension as well as a full-fledged API. [sent-148, score-0.476]
</p><p>64 Our work also complements previous attempts by NLP researchers to provide the community with freely available tools to perform state-of-the-art WSD using WordNet-based measures of semantic relatedness (Patwardhan et al. [sent-149, score-0.158]
</p><p>65 , 2005), as well as supervised WSD techniques (Zhong and Ng, 2010). [sent-150, score-0.027]
</p><p>66 We achieve this by building upon BabelNet, a multilingual ‘encyclopedic dictionary’ bringing together the lexicographic and encyclopedic knowledge from WordNet  and Wikipedia. [sent-151, score-0.409]
</p><p>67 Other recent projects on creating multilingual knowledge bases from Wikipedia include WikiNet (Nastase et al. [sent-152, score-0.299]

<p>Author: Limin Yao ; Sebastian Riedel ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: To discover relation types from text, most methods cluster shallow or syntactic patterns of relation mentions, but consider only one possible sense per pattern. In practice this assumption is often violated. In this paper we overcome this issue by inducing clusters of pattern senses from feature representations of patterns. In particular, we employ a topic model to partition entity pairs associated with patterns into sense clusters using local and global features. We merge these sense clusters into semantic relations using hierarchical agglomerative clustering. We compare against several baselines: a generative latent-variable model, a clustering method that does not disambiguate between path senses, and our own approach but with only local features. Experimental results show our proposed approach discovers dramatically more accurate clusters than models without sense disambiguation, and that incorporating global features, such as the document theme, is crucial.</p><p>6 0.08291965 <a title="152-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Polarity_Consistency_Checking_for_Sentiment_Dictionaries.html">161 acl-2012-Polarity Consistency Checking for Sentiment Dictionaries</a></p>

<p>Author: Gerard de Melo ; Gerhard Weikum</p><p>Abstract: We present UWN, a large multilingual lexical knowledge base that describes the meanings and relationships of words in over 200 languages. This paper explains how link prediction, information integration and taxonomy induction methods have been used to build UWN based on WordNet and extend it with millions of named entities from Wikipedia. We additionally introduce extensions to cover lexical relationships, frame-semantic knowledge, and language data. An online interface provides human access to the data, while a software API enables applications to look up over 16 million words and names.</p><p>3 0.69018418 <a title="152-lsi-3" href="./acl-2012-Word_Sense_Disambiguation_Improves_Information_Retrieval.html">217 acl-2012-Word Sense Disambiguation Improves Information Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhi Zhong ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: Previous research has conflicting conclusions on whether word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems can improve information retrieval (IR) performance. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate sense distributions for short queries. Together with the senses predicted for words in documents, we propose a novel approach to incorporate word senses into the language modeling approach to IR and also exploit the integration of synonym relations. Our experimental results on standard TREC collections show that using the word senses tagged by a supervised WSD system, we obtain significant improvements over a state-of-the-art IR system.</p><p>4 0.54707652 <a title="152-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-Learning_the_Latent_Semantics_of_a_Concept_from_its_Definition.html">132 acl-2012-Learning the Latent Semantics of a Concept from its Definition</a></p>
<p>Author: Weiwei Guo ; Mona Diab</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we study unsupervised word sense disambiguation (WSD) based on sense definition. We learn low-dimensional latent semantic vectors of concept definitions to construct a more robust sense similarity measure wmfvec. Experiments on four all-words WSD data sets show significant improvement over the baseline WSD systems and LDA based similarity measures, achieving results comparable to state of the art WSD systems.</p><p>5 0.4641147 <a title="152-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-Polarity_Consistency_Checking_for_Sentiment_Dictionaries.html">161 acl-2012-Polarity Consistency Checking for Sentiment Dictionaries</a></p>
<p>Author: Eduard Dragut ; Hong Wang ; Clement Yu ; Prasad Sistla ; Weiyi Meng</p><p>Abstract: Polarity classification of words is important for applications such as Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis. A number of sentiment word/sense dictionaries have been manually or (semi)automatically constructed. The dictionaries have substantial inaccuracies. Besides obvious instances, where the same word appears with different polarities in different dictionaries, the dictionaries exhibit complex cases, which cannot be detected by mere manual inspection. We introduce the concept of polarity consistency of words/senses in sentiment dictionaries in this paper. We show that the consistency problem is NP-complete. We reduce the polarity consistency problem to the satisfiability problem and utilize a fast SAT solver to detect inconsistencies in a sentiment dictionary. We perform experiments on four sentiment dictionaries and WordNet.</p><p>6 0.35675114 <a title="152-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-Coarse_Lexical_Semantic_Annotation_with_Supersenses%3A_An_Arabic_Case_Study.html">49 acl-2012-Coarse Lexical Semantic Annotation with Supersenses: An Arabic Case Study</a></p>

<p>Author: Meni Adler ; Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel text exploration model, which extends the scope of state-of-the-art technologies by moving from standard concept-based exploration to statement-based exploration. The proposed scheme utilizes the textual entailment relation between statements as the basis of the exploration process. A user of our system can explore the result space of a query by drilling down/up from one statement to another, according to entailment relations specified by an entailment graph and an optional concept taxonomy. As a prominent use case, we apply our exploration system and illustrate its benefit on the health-care domain. To the best of our knowledge this is the first implementation of an exploration system at the statement level that is based on the textual entailment relation. 1</p><p>2 0.87204999 <a title="152-lda-2" href="./acl-2012-A_Graphical_Interface_for_MT_Evaluation_and_Error_Analysis.html">13 acl-2012-A Graphical Interface for MT Evaluation and Error Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Meritxell Gonzalez ; Jesus Gimenez ; Lluis Marquez</p><p>Abstract: Error analysis in machine translation is a necessary step in order to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of the MT systems under development and allow fair comparisons among them. This work presents an application that shows how a set of heterogeneous automatic metrics can be used to evaluate a test bed of automatic translations. To do so, we have set up an online graphical interface for the ASIYA toolkit, a rich repository of evaluation measures working at different linguistic levels. The current implementation of the interface shows constituency and dependency trees as well as shallow syntactic and semantic annotations, and word alignments. The intelligent visualization of the linguistic structures used by the metrics, as well as a set of navigational functionalities, may lead towards advanced methods for automatic error analysis.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.8635447 <a title="152-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Multilingual_WSD_with_Just_a_Few_Lines_of_Code%3A_the_BabelNet_API.html">152 acl-2012-Multilingual WSD with Just a Few Lines of Code: the BabelNet API</a></p>

<p>Author: Khe Chai Sim</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic framework that combines multiple knowledge sources for Haptic Voice Recognition (HVR), a multimodal input method designed to provide efficient text entry on modern mobile devices. HVR extends the conventional voice input by allowing users to provide complementary partial lexical information via touch input to improve the efficiency and accuracy of voice recognition. This paper investigates the use of the initial letter of the words in the utterance as the partial lexical information. In addition to the acoustic and language models used in automatic speech recognition systems, HVR uses the haptic and partial lexical models as additional knowledge sources to reduce the recognition search space and suppress confusions. Experimental results show that both the word error rate and runtime factor can be re- duced by a factor of two using HVR.</p><p>5 0.79682398 <a title="152-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Fast_and_Robust_Part-of-Speech_Tagging_Using_Dynamic_Model_Selection.html">96 acl-2012-Fast and Robust Part-of-Speech Tagging Using Dynamic Model Selection</a></p>
<p>Author: Jinho D. Choi ; Martha Palmer</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel way of improving POS tagging on heterogeneous data. First, two separate models are trained (generalized and domain-specific) from the same data set by controlling lexical items with different document frequencies. During decoding, one of the models is selected dynamically given the cosine similarity between each sentence and the training data. This dynamic model selection approach, coupled with a one-pass, leftto-right POS tagging algorithm, is evaluated on corpora from seven different genres. Even with this simple tagging algorithm, our system shows comparable results against other state-of-the-art systems, and gives higher accuracies when evaluated on a mixture of the data. Furthermore, our system is able to tag about 32K tokens per second. this model selection approach to more sophisticated tagging improve their robustness even We believe that can be applied algorithms and further.</p><p>6 0.7053411 <a title="152-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Post-ordering_by_Parsing_for_Japanese-English_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">162 acl-2012-Post-ordering by Parsing for Japanese-English Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

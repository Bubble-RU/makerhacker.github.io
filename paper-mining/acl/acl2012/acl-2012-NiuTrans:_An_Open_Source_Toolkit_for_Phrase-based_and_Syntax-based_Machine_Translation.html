<p>Author: Nan Yang ; Mu Li ; Dongdong Zhang ; Nenghai Yu</p><p>Abstract: Long distance word reordering is a major challenge in statistical machine translation research. Previous work has shown using source syntactic trees is an effective way to tackle this problem between two languages with substantial word order difference. In this work, we further extend this line of exploration and propose a novel but simple approach, which utilizes a ranking model based on word order precedence in the target language to reposition nodes in the syntactic parse tree of a source sentence. The ranking model is automatically derived from word aligned parallel data with a syntactic parser for source language based on both lexical and syntactical features. We evaluated our approach on largescale Japanese-English and English-Japanese machine translation tasks, and show that it can significantly outperform the baseline phrase- based SMT system.</p><p>3 0.28811347 <a title="155-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Modified_Distortion_Matrices_for_Phrase-Based_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">148 acl-2012-Modified Distortion Matrices for Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Arianna Bisazza ; Marcello Federico</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel method to suggest long word reorderings to a phrase-based SMT decoder. We address language pairs where long reordering concentrates on few patterns, and use fuzzy chunk-based rules to predict likely reorderings for these phenomena. Then we use reordered n-gram LMs to rank the resulting permutations and select the n-best for translation. Finally we encode these reorderings by modifying selected entries of the distortion cost matrix, on a per-sentence basis. In this way, we expand the search space by a much finer degree than if we simply raised the distortion limit. The proposed techniques are tested on Arabic-English and German-English using well-known SMT benchmarks.</p><p>4 0.2650525 <a title="155-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Mixing_Multiple_Translation_Models_in_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">143 acl-2012-Mixing Multiple Translation Models in Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Majid Razmara ; George Foster ; Baskaran Sankaran ; Anoop Sarkar</p><p>Abstract: Statistical machine translation is often faced with the problem of combining training data from many diverse sources into a single translation model which then has to translate sentences in a new domain. We propose a novel approach, ensemble decoding, which combines a number of translation systems dynamically at the decoding step. In this paper, we evaluate performance on a domain adaptation setting where we translate sentences from the medical domain. Our experimental results show that ensemble decoding outperforms various strong baselines including mixture models, the current state-of-the-art for domain adaptation in machine translation.</p><p>5 0.26302043 <a title="155-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-An_Exploration_of_Forest-to-String_Translation%3A_Does_Translation_Help_or_Hurt_Parsing%3F.html">25 acl-2012-An Exploration of Forest-to-String Translation: Does Translation Help or Hurt Parsing?</a></p>
<p>Author: Hui Zhang ; David Chiang</p><p>Abstract: Syntax-based translation models that operate on the output of a source-language parser have been shown to perform better if allowed to choose from a set of possible parses. In this paper, we investigate whether this is because it allows the translation stage to overcome parser errors or to override the syntactic structure itself. We find that it is primarily the latter, but that under the right conditions, the translation stage does correct parser errors, improving parsing accuracy on the Chinese Treebank.</p><p>6 0.25728351 <a title="155-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-A_Class-Based_Agreement_Model_for_Generating_Accurately_Inflected_Translations.html">3 acl-2012-A Class-Based Agreement Model for Generating Accurately Inflected Translations</a></p>

<p>Author: Shujie Liu ; Chi-Ho Li ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the issue for learning better translation consensus in machine translation (MT) research, and explore the search of translation consensus from similar, rather than the same, source sentences or their spans. Unlike previous work on this topic, we formulate the problem as structured labeling over a much smaller graph, and we propose a novel structured label propagation for the task. We convert such graph-based translation consensus from similar source strings into useful features both for n-best output reranking and for decoding algorithm. Experimental results show that, our method can significantly improve machine translation performance on both IWSLT and NIST data, compared with a state-ofthe-art baseline. 1</p><p>4 0.72897685 <a title="155-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-Modified_Distortion_Matrices_for_Phrase-Based_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">148 acl-2012-Modified Distortion Matrices for Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

In order to reliably learn a myriad of parameters in these models, we propose an expected BLEU score-based utility function with KL regularization as the objective, and train the models on a large parallel dataset. For training, we derive growth transformations for phrase and lexicon translation probabilities to iteratively improve the objective. The proposed method, evaluated on the Europarl German-to-English dataset, leads to a 1.1 BLEU point improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline translation system. In IWSLT 201 1 Benchmark, our system using the proposed method achieves the best Chinese-to-English translation result on the task of translating TED talks.</p><p>3 0.839463 <a title="155-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Modeling_the_Translation_of_Predicate-Argument_Structure_for_SMT.html">147 acl-2012-Modeling the Translation of Predicate-Argument Structure for SMT</a></p>
<p>Author: Deyi Xiong ; Min Zhang ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: Predicate-argument structure contains rich semantic information of which statistical machine translation hasn’t taken full advantage. In this paper, we propose two discriminative, feature-based models to exploit predicateargument structures for statistical machine translation: 1) a predicate translation model and 2) an argument reordering model. The predicate translation model explores lexical and semantic contexts surrounding a verbal predicate to select desirable translations for the predicate. The argument reordering model automatically predicts the moving direction of an argument relative to its predicate after translation using semantic features. The two models are integrated into a state-of-theart phrase-based machine translation system and evaluated on Chinese-to-English transla- , tion tasks with large-scale training data. Experimental results demonstrate that the two models significantly improve translation accuracy.</p><p>4 0.835536 <a title="155-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Concept-to-text_Generation_via_Discriminative_Reranking.html">57 acl-2012-Concept-to-text Generation via Discriminative Reranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Ioannis Konstas ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven method for concept-to-text generation, the task of automatically producing textual output from non-linguistic input. A key insight in our approach is to reduce the tasks of content selection (“what to say”) and surface realization (“how to say”) into a common parsing problem. We define a probabilistic context-free grammar that describes the structure of the input (a corpus of database records and text describing some of them) and represent it compactly as a weighted hypergraph. The hypergraph structure encodes exponentially many derivations, which we rerank discriminatively using local and global features. We propose a novel decoding algorithm for finding the best scoring derivation and generating in this setting. Experimental evaluation on the ATIS domain shows that our model outperforms a competitive discriminative system both using BLEU and in a judgment elicitation study.</p><p>5 0.83206505 <a title="155-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Learning_Translation_Consensus_with_Structured_Label_Propagation.html">131 acl-2012-Learning Translation Consensus with Structured Label Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Shujie Liu ; Chi-Ho Li ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the issue for learning better translation consensus in machine translation (MT) research, and explore the search of translation consensus from similar, rather than the same, source sentences or their spans. Unlike previous work on this topic, we formulate the problem as structured labeling over a much smaller graph, and we propose a novel structured label propagation for the task. We convert such graph-based translation consensus from similar source strings into useful features both for n-best output reranking and for decoding algorithm. Experimental results show that, our method can significantly improve machine translation performance on both IWSLT and NIST data, compared with a state-ofthe-art baseline. 1</p><p>6 0.81053507 <a title="155-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-An_Exploration_of_Forest-to-String_Translation%3A_Does_Translation_Help_or_Hurt_Parsing%3F.html">25 acl-2012-An Exploration of Forest-to-String Translation: Does Translation Help or Hurt Parsing?</a></p>

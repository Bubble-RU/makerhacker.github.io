<p>Author: Mohit Bansal ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: To address semantic ambiguities in coreference resolution, we use Web n-gram features that capture a range of world knowledge in a diffuse but robust way. Specifically, we exploit short-distance cues to hypernymy, semantic compatibility, and semantic context, as well as general lexical co-occurrence. When added to a state-of-the-art coreference baseline, our Web features give significant gains on multiple datasets (ACE 2004 and ACE 2005) and metrics (MUC and B3), resulting in the best results reported to date for the end-to-end task of coreference resolution.</p><p>3 0.16404587 <a title="50-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-A_Discriminative_Hierarchical_Model_for_Fast_Coreference_at_Large_Scale.html">10 acl-2012-A Discriminative Hierarchical Model for Fast Coreference at Large Scale</a></p>

However, they suffer from a number of drawbacks including difficulties scaling to large numbers of mentions and limited representational power. As these drawbacks become increasingly restrictive, the need to replace the pairwise approaches with a more expressive, highly scalable alternative is becoming urgent. In this paper we propose a novel discriminative hierarchical model that recursively partitions entities into trees of latent sub-entities. These trees succinctly summarize the mentions providing a highly compact, information-rich structure for reasoning about entities and coreference uncertainty at massive scales. We demonstrate that the hierarchical model is several orders of magnitude faster than pairwise, allowing us to perform coreference on six million author mentions in under four hours on a single CPU.</p><p>4 0.095987037 <a title="50-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-PDTB-style_Discourse_Annotation_of_Chinese_Text.html">157 acl-2012-PDTB-style Discourse Annotation of Chinese Text</a></p>

Our scheme, inspired by the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB), adopts the lexically grounded approach; at the same time, it makes adaptations based on the linguistic and statistical characteristics of Chinese text. Annotation results show that these adaptations work well in practice. Our scheme, taken together with other PDTB-style schemes (e.g. for English, Turkish, Hindi, and Czech), affords a broader perspective on how the generalized lexically grounded approach can flesh itself out in the context of cross-linguistic annotation of discourse relations.</p><p>5 0.086531386 <a title="50-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Towards_the_Unsupervised_Acquisition_of_Discourse_Relations.html">201 acl-2012-Towards the Unsupervised Acquisition of Discourse Relations</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian Chiarcos</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a novel approach towards the empirical approximation of discourse relations between different utterances in texts. Following the idea that every pair of events comes with preferences regarding the range and frequency of discourse relations connecting both parts, the paper investigates whether these preferences are manifested in the distribution of relation words (that serve to signal these relations). Experiments on two large-scale English web corpora show that significant correlations between pairs of adjacent events and relation words exist, that they are reproducible on different data sets, and for three relation words, that their distribution corresponds to theorybased assumptions. 1 Motivation Texts are not merely accumulations of isolated utterances, but the arrangement of utterances conveys meaning; human text understanding can thus be described as a process to recover the global structure of texts and the relations linking its different parts (Vallduv ı´ 1992; Gernsbacher et al. 2004). To capture these aspects of meaning in NLP, it is necessary to develop operationalizable theories, and, within a supervised approach, large amounts of annotated training data. To facilitate manual annotation, weakly supervised or unsupervised techniques can be applied as preprocessing step for semimanual annotation, and this is part of the motivation of the approach described here. 213 Discourse relations involve different aspects of meaning. This may include factual knowledge about the connected discourse segments (a ‘subjectmatter’ relation, e.g., if one utterance represents the cause for another, Mann and Thompson 1988, p.257), argumentative purposes (a ‘presentational’ relation, e.g., one utterance motivates the reader to accept a claim formulated in another utterance, ibid., p.257), or relations between entities mentioned in the connected discourse segments (anaphoric relations, Webber et al. 2003). Discourse relations can be indicated explicitly by optional cues, e.g., adverbials (e.g., however), conjunctions (e.g., but), or complex phrases (e.g., in contrast to what Peter said a minute ago). Here, these cues are referred to as relation words. Assuming that relation words are associated with specific discourse relations (Knott and Dale 1994; Prasad et al. 2008), the distribution of relation words found between two (types of) events can yield insights into the range of discourse relations possible at this occasion and their respective likeliness. For this purpose, this paper proposes a background knowledge base (BKB) that hosts pairs of events (here heuristically represented by verbs) along with distributional profiles for relation words. The primary data structure of the BKB is a triple where one event (type) is connected with a particular relation word to another event (type). Triples are further augmented with a frequency score (expressing the likelihood of the triple to be observed), a significance score (see below), and a correlation score (indicating whether a pair of events has a positive or negative correlation with a particular relation word). ProceedJienjgus, R ofep thueb 5lic0t hof A Knonrueaa,l M 8-e1e4ti Jnugly o f2 t0h1e2 A.s ?c so2c0ia1t2io Ans fsoorc Ciatoiomnp fuotart Cioonmaplu Ltiantgiounisatlic Lsi,n pgaugiestsi2c 1s3–217, Triples can be easily acquired from automatically parsed corpora. While the relation word is usually part of the utterance that represents the source of the relation, determining the appropriate target (antecedent) of the relation may be difficult to achieve. As a heuristic, an adjacency preference is adopted, i.e., the target is identified with the main event of the preceding utterance.1 The BKB can be constructed from a sufficiently large corpus as follows: • • identify event types and relation words for every utterance create a candidate triple consisting of the event type of the utterance, the relation word, and the event type of the preceding utterance. add the candidate triple to the BKB, if it found in the BKB, increase its score by (or initialize it with) 1, – – • perform a pruning on all candidate triples, calcpuerlaftoer significance aonnd a lclo crarneldaitdioante scores Pruning uses statistical significance tests to evaluate whether the relative frequency of a relation word for a pair of events is significantly higher or lower than the relative frequency of the relation word in the entire corpus. Assuming that incorrect candidate triples (i.e., where the factual target of the relation was non-adjacent) are equally distributed, they should be filtered out by the significance tests. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the validity of this approach. 2 Experimental Setup By generalizing over multiple occurrences of the same events (or, more precisely, event types), one can identify preferences of event pairs for one or several relation words. These preferences capture context-invariant characteristics of pairs of events and are thus to considered to reflect a semantic predisposition for a particular discourse relation. Formally, an event is the semantic representation of the meaning conveyed in the utterance. We 1Relations between non-adjacent utterances are constrained by the structure of discourse (Webber 1991), and thus less likely than relations between adjacent utterances. 214 assume that the same event can reoccur in different contexts, we are thus studying relations between types of events. For the experiment described here, events are heuristically identified with the main predicates of a sentence, i.e., non-auxiliar, noncausative, non-modal verbal lexemes that serve as heads of main clauses. The primary data structure of the approach described here is a triple consisting of a source event, a relation word and a target (antecedent) event. These triples are harvested from large syntactically annotated corpora. For intersentential relations, the target is identified with the event of the immediately preceding main clause. These extraction preferences are heuristic approximations, and thus, an additional pruning step is necessary. For this purpose, statistical significance tests are adopted (χ2 for triples of frequent events and relation words, t-test for rare events and/or relation words) that compare the relative frequency of a rela- tion word given a pair of events with the relative frequency of the relation word in the entire corpus. All results with p ≥ .05 are excluded, i.e., only triples are preserved pfo ≥r w .0h5ic ahr teh eex xocblsuedrevde,d i positive or negative correlation between a pair of events and a relation word is not due to chance with at least 95% probability. Assuming an even distribution of incorrect target events, this should rule these out. Additionally, it also serves as a means of evaluation. Using statistical significance tests as pruning criterion entails that all triples eventually confirmed are statistically significant.2 This setup requires immense amounts of data: We are dealing with several thousand events (theoretically, the total number of verbs of a language). The chance probability for two events to occur in adjacent position is thus far below 10−6, and it decreases further if the likelihood of a relation word is taken into consideration. All things being equal, we thus need millions of sentences to create the BKB. Here, two large-scale corpora of English are employed, PukWaC and Wackypedia EN (Baroni et al. 2009). PukWaC is a 2G-token web corpus of British English crawled from the uk domain (Ferraresi et al. 2Subsequent studies may employ less rigid pruning criteria. For the purpose of the current paper, however, the statistical significance of all extracted triples serves as an criterion to evaluate methodological validity. 2008), and parsed with MaltParser (Nivre et al. 2006). It is distributed in 5 parts; Only PukWaC1 to PukWaC-4 were considered here, constituting 82.2% (72.5M sentences) of the entire corpus, PukWaC-5 is left untouched for forthcoming evaluation experiments. Wackypedia EN is a 0.8G-token dump of the English Wikipedia, annotated with the same tools. It is distributed in 4 different files; the last portion was left untouched for forthcoming evaluation experiments. The portion analyzed here comprises 33.2M sentences, 75.9% of the corpus. The extraction of events in these corpora uses simple patterns that combine dependency information and part-of-speech tags to retrieve the main verbs and store their lemmata as event types. The target (antecedent) event was identified with the last main event of the preceding sentence. As relation words, only sentence-initial children of the source event that were annotated as adverbial modifiers, verb modifiers or conjunctions were considered. 3 Evaluation To evaluate the validity of the approach, three fundamental questions need to be addressed: significance (are there significant correlations between pairs of events and relation words ?), reproducibility (can these correlations confirmed on independent data sets ?), and interpretability (can these correlations be interpreted in terms of theoretically-defined discourse relations ?). 3.1 Significance and Reproducibility Significance tests are part of the pruning stage of the algorithm. Therefore, the number of triples eventually retrieved confirms the existence of statistically significant correlations between pairs of events and relation words. The left column of Tab. 1 shows the number of triples obtained from PukWaC subcorpora of different size. For reproducibility, compare the triples identified with Wackypedia EN and PukWaC subcorpora of different size: Table 1 shows the number of triples found in both Wackypedia EN and PukWaC, and the agreement between both resources. For two triples involving the same events (event types) and the same relation word, agreement means that the relation word shows either positive or negative correlation 215 TasPbe13u7l4n2k98t.

Table 1 confirms that results obtained on one resource can be reproduced on another. This indicates that triples indeed capture context-invariant, and hence, semantic, characteristics of the relation between events. The data also indicates that reproducibility increases with the size of corpora from which a BKB is built. 3.2 Interpretability Any theory of discourse relations would predict that relation words with similar function should have similar distributions, whereas one would expect different distributions for functionally unrelated relation words. These expectations are tested here for three of the most frequent relation words found in the corpora, i.e., but, then and however. But and however can be grouped together under a generalized notion of contrast (Knott and Dale 1994; Prasad et al. 2008); then, on the other hand, indicates a tem- poral and/or causal relation. Table 2 confirms the expectation that event pairs that are correlated with but tend to show the same correlation with however, but not with then. 4 Discussion and Outlook This paper described a novel approach towards the unsupervised acquisition of discourse relations, with encouraging preliminary results: Large collections of parsed text are used to assess distributional profiles of relation words that indicate discourse relations that are possible between specific types of events; on this basis, a background knowledge base (BKB) was created that can be used to predict an appropriatediscoursemarkertoconnecttwoutterances with no overt relation word. This information can be used, for example, to facilitate the semiautomated annotation of discourse relations, by pointing out the ‘default’ relation word for a given pair of events. Similarly, Zhou et al. (2010) used a language model to predict discourse markers for implicitly realized discourse relations. As opposed to this shallow, n-gram-based approach, here, the internal structure of utterances is exploited: based on semantic considerations, syntactic patterns have been devised that extract triples of event pairs and relation words. The resulting BKB provides a distributional approximation of the discourse relations that can hold between two specific event types. Both approaches exploit complementary sources of knowledge, and may be combined with each other to achieve a more precise prediction of implicit discourse connectives. The validity of the approach was evaluated with respect to three evaluation criteria: The extracted associations between relation words and event pairs could be shown to be statistically significant, and to be reproducible on other corpora; for three highly frequent relation words, theoretical predictions about their relative distribution could be confirmed, indicating their interpretability in terms of presupposed taxonomies of discourse relations. Another prospective field of application can be seen in NLP applications, where selection preferences for relation words may serve as a cheap replacement for full-fledged discourse parsing. In the Natural Language Understanding domain, the BKB may help to disambiguate or to identify discourse relations between different events; in the context of Machine Translation, it may represent a factor guid- ing the insertion of relation words, a task that has been found to be problematic for languages that dif216 fer in their inventory and usage of discourse markers, e.g., German and English (Stede and Schmitz 2000). The approach is language-independent (except for the syntactic extraction patterns), and it does not require manually annotated data. It would thus be easy to create background knowledge bases with relation words for other languages or specific domains given a sufficient amount of textual data. – Related research includes, for example, the unsupervised recognition of causal and temporal relationships, as required, for example, for the recognition of textual entailment. Riaz and Girju (2010) exploit distributional information about pairs of utterances. Unlike approach described here, they are not restricted to adjacent utterances, and do not rely on explicit and recurrent relation words. Their approach can thus be applied to comparably small data sets. However, they are restricted to a specific type of relations whereas here the entire band- width of discourse relations that are explicitly realized in a language are covered. Prospectively, both approaches could be combined to compensate their respective weaknesses. Similar observations can be made with respect to Chambers and Jurafsky (2009) and Kasch and Oates (2010), who also study a single discourse relation (narration), and are thus more limited in scope than the approach described here. However, as their approach extends beyond pairs of events to complex event chains, it seems that both approaches provide complementary types of information and their results could also be combined in a fruitful way to achieve a more detailed assessment of discourse relations. The goal of this paper was to evaluate the methdological validity of the approach. It thus represents the basis for further experiments, e.g., with respect to the enrichment the BKB with information provided by Riaz and Girju (2010), Chambers and Jurafsky (2009) and Kasch and Oates (2010). Other directions of subsequent research may include address more elaborate models of events, and the investigation of the relationship between relation words and taxonomies of discourse relations.

<p>Author: Katja Markert ; Yufang Hou ; Michael Strube</p><p>Abstract: Previous work on classifying information status (Nissim, 2006; Rahman and Ng, 2011) is restricted to coarse-grained classification and focuses on conversational dialogue. We here introduce the task of classifying finegrained information status and work on written text. We add a fine-grained information status layer to the Wall Street Journal portion of the OntoNotes corpus. We claim that the information status of a mention depends not only on the mention itself but also on other mentions in the vicinity and solve the task by collectively classifying the information status ofall mentions. Our approach strongly outperforms reimplementations of previous work.</p><p>2 0.80102557 <a title="50-lsi-2" href="./acl-2012-Coreference_Semantics_from_Web_Features.html">58 acl-2012-Coreference Semantics from Web Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohit Bansal ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: To address semantic ambiguities in coreference resolution, we use Web n-gram features that capture a range of world knowledge in a diffuse but robust way. Specifically, we exploit short-distance cues to hypernymy, semantic compatibility, and semantic context, as well as general lexical co-occurrence. When added to a state-of-the-art coreference baseline, our Web features give significant gains on multiple datasets (ACE 2004 and ACE 2005) and metrics (MUC and B3), resulting in the best results reported to date for the end-to-end task of coreference resolution.</p><p>3 0.75210661 <a title="50-lsi-3" href="./acl-2012-A_Discriminative_Hierarchical_Model_for_Fast_Coreference_at_Large_Scale.html">10 acl-2012-A Discriminative Hierarchical Model for Fast Coreference at Large Scale</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Wick ; Sameer Singh ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: Sameer Singh Andrew McCallum University of Massachusetts University of Massachusetts 140 Governor’s Drive 140 Governor’s Drive Amherst, MA Amherst, MA s ameer@ cs .umas s .edu mccal lum@ c s .umas s .edu Hamming” who authored “The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.” Features of the mentions Methods that measure compatibility between mention pairs are currently the dominant ap- proach to coreference. However, they suffer from a number of drawbacks including difficulties scaling to large numbers of mentions and limited representational power. As these drawbacks become increasingly restrictive, the need to replace the pairwise approaches with a more expressive, highly scalable alternative is becoming urgent. In this paper we propose a novel discriminative hierarchical model that recursively partitions entities into trees of latent sub-entities. These trees succinctly summarize the mentions providing a highly compact, information-rich structure for reasoning about entities and coreference uncertainty at massive scales. We demonstrate that the hierarchical model is several orders of magnitude faster than pairwise, allowing us to perform coreference on six million author mentions in under four hours on a single CPU.</p><p>4 0.54086447 <a title="50-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-Event_Linking%3A_Grounding_Event_Reference_in_a_News_Archive.html">85 acl-2012-Event Linking: Grounding Event Reference in a News Archive</a></p>
<p>Author: Joel Nothman ; Matthew Honnibal ; Ben Hachey ; James R. Curran</p><p>Abstract: Interpreting news requires identifying its constituent events. Events are complex linguistically and ontologically, so disambiguating their reference is challenging. We introduce event linking, which canonically labels an event reference with the article where it was first reported. This implicitly relaxes coreference to co-reporting, and will practically enable augmenting news archives with semantic hyperlinks. We annotate and analyse a corpus of 150 documents, extracting 501 links to a news archive with reasonable inter-annotator agreement.</p><p>5 0.5270192 <a title="50-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-A_Probabilistic_Model_for_Canonicalizing_Named_Entity_Mentions.html">18 acl-2012-A Probabilistic Model for Canonicalizing Named Entity Mentions</a></p>
<p>Author: Dani Yogatama ; Yanchuan Sim ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We present a statistical model for canonicalizing named entity mentions into a table whose rows represent entities and whose columns are attributes (or parts of attributes). The model is novel in that it incorporates entity context, surface features, firstorder dependencies among attribute-parts, and a notion of noise. Transductive learning from a few seeds and a collection of mention tokens combines Bayesian inference and conditional estimation. We evaluate our model and its components on two datasets collected from political blogs and sports news, finding that it outperforms a simple agglomerative clustering approach and previous work.</p><p>6 0.51142246 <a title="50-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-The_Creation_of_a_Corpus_of_English_Metalanguage.html">195 acl-2012-The Creation of a Corpus of English Metalanguage</a></p>

<p>Author: Shomir Wilson</p><p>Abstract: Metalanguage is an essential linguistic mechanism which allows us to communicate explicit information about language itself. However, it has been underexamined in research in language technologies, to the detriment of the performance of systems that could exploit it. This paper describes the creation of the first tagged and delineated corpus of English metalanguage, accompanied by an explicit definition and a rubric for identifying the phenomenon in text. This resource will provide a basis for further studies of metalanguage and enable its utilization in language technologies.</p><p>3 0.4377178 <a title="50-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Automatic_Event_Extraction_with_Structured_Preference_Modeling.html">33 acl-2012-Automatic Event Extraction with Structured Preference Modeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Lu ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel sequence labeling model based on the latent-variable semiMarkov conditional random fields for jointly extracting argument roles of events from texts. The model takes in coarse mention and type information and predicts argument roles for a given event template. This paper addresses the event extraction problem in a primarily unsupervised setting, where no labeled training instances are available. Our key contribution is a novel learning framework called structured preference modeling (PM), that allows arbitrary preference to be assigned to certain structures during the learning procedure. We establish and discuss connections between this framework and other existing works. We show empirically that the structured preferences are crucial to the success of our task. Our model, trained without annotated data and with a small number of structured preferences, yields performance competitive to some baseline supervised approaches.</p><p>4 0.4329797 <a title="50-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-A_System_for_Real-time_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_of_2012_U.S._Presidential_Election_Cycle.html">21 acl-2012-A System for Real-time Twitter Sentiment Analysis of 2012 U.S. Presidential Election Cycle</a></p>
<p>Author: Hao Wang ; Dogan Can ; Abe Kazemzadeh ; Francois Bar ; Shrikanth Narayanan</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a system for real-time analysis of public sentiment toward presidential candidates in the 2012 U.S. election as expressed on Twitter, a microblogging service. Twitter has become a central site where people express their opinions and views on political parties and candidates. Emerging events or news are often followed almost instantly by a burst in Twitter volume, providing a unique opportunity to gauge the relation between expressed public sentiment and electoral events. In addition, sentiment analysis can help explore how these events affect public opinion. While traditional content analysis takes days or weeks to complete, the system demonstrated here analyzes sentiment in the entire Twitter traffic about the election, delivering results instantly and continuously. It offers the public, the media, politicians and scholars a new and timely perspective on the dynamics of the electoral process and public opinion. 1</p><p>5 0.43234122 <a title="50-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Crosslingual_Induction_of_Semantic_Roles.html">64 acl-2012-Crosslingual Induction of Semantic Roles</a></p>
<p>Author: Ivan Titov ; Alexandre Klementiev</p><p>Abstract: We argue that multilingual parallel data provides a valuable source of indirect supervision for induction of shallow semantic representations. Specifically, we consider unsupervised induction of semantic roles from sentences annotated with automatically-predicted syntactic dependency representations and use a stateof-the-art generative Bayesian non-parametric model. At inference time, instead of only seeking the model which explains the monolingual data available for each language, we regularize the objective by introducing a soft constraint penalizing for disagreement in argument labeling on aligned sentences. We propose a simple approximate learning algorithm for our set-up which results in efficient inference. When applied to German-English parallel data, our method obtains a substantial improvement over a model trained without using the agreement signal, when both are tested on non-parallel sentences.</p><p>6 0.43020594 <a title="50-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Text-level_Discourse_Parsing_with_Rich_Linguistic_Features.html">193 acl-2012-Text-level Discourse Parsing with Rich Linguistic Features</a></p>

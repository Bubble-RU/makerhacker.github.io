<p>Author: Naomi Zeichner ; Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: The importance of inference rules to semantic applications has long been recognized and extensive work has been carried out to automatically acquire inference-rule resources. However, evaluating such resources has turned out to be a non-trivial task, slowing progress in the field. In this paper, we suggest a framework for evaluating inference-rule resources. Our framework simplifies a previously proposed “instance-based evaluation” method that involved substantial annotator training, making it suitable for crowdsourcing. We show that our method produces a large amount of annotations with high inter-annotator agreement for a low cost at a short period of time, without requiring training expert annotators.</p><p>3 0.09285982 <a title="133-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Sentence_Compression_with_Semantic_Role_Constraints.html">176 acl-2012-Sentence Compression with Semantic Role Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Katsumasa Yoshikawa ; Ryu Iida ; Tsutomu Hirao ; Manabu Okumura</p><p>Abstract: For sentence compression, we propose new semantic constraints to directly capture the relations between a predicate and its arguments, whereas the existing approaches have focused on relatively shallow linguistic properties, such as lexical and syntactic information. These constraints are based on semantic roles and superior to the constraints of syntactic dependencies. Our empirical evaluation on the Written News Compression Corpus (Clarke and Lapata, 2008) demonstrates that our system achieves results comparable to other state-of-the-art techniques.</p><p>4 0.083008312 <a title="133-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Efficient_Tree-based_Approximation_for_Entailment_Graph_Learning.html">80 acl-2012-Efficient Tree-based Approximation for Entailment Graph Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan ; Meni Adler ; Jacob Goldberger</p><p>Abstract: Learning entailment rules is fundamental in many semantic-inference applications and has been an active field of research in recent years. In this paper we address the problem of learning transitive graphs that describe entailment rules between predicates (termed entailment graphs). We first identify that entailment graphs exhibit a “tree-like” property and are very similar to a novel type of graph termed forest-reducible graph. We utilize this property to develop an iterative efficient approximation algorithm for learning the graph edges, where each iteration takes linear time. We compare our approximation algorithm to a recently-proposed state-of-the-art exact algorithm and show that it is more efficient and scalable both theoretically and empirically, while its output quality is close to that given by the optimal solution of the exact algorithm.</p><p>5 0.082585141 <a title="133-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-A_Topic_Similarity_Model_for_Hierarchical_Phrase-based_Translation.html">22 acl-2012-A Topic Similarity Model for Hierarchical Phrase-based Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinyan Xiao ; Deyi Xiong ; Min Zhang ; Qun Liu ; Shouxun Lin</p><p>Abstract: Previous work using topic model for statistical machine translation (SMT) explore topic information at the word level. However, SMT has been advanced from word-based paradigm to phrase/rule-based paradigm. We therefore propose a topic similarity model to exploit topic information at the synchronous rule level for hierarchical phrase-based translation. We associate each synchronous rule with a topic distribution, and select desirable rules according to the similarity of their topic distributions with given documents. We show that our model significantly improves the translation performance over the baseline on NIST Chinese-to-English translation experiments. Our model also achieves a better performance and a faster speed than previous approaches that work at the word level.</p><p>6 0.073186688 <a title="133-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Mining_Entity_Types_from_Query_Logs_via_User_Intent_Modeling.html">142 acl-2012-Mining Entity Types from Query Logs via User Intent Modeling</a></p>

<p>Author: Meni Adler ; Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel text exploration model, which extends the scope of state-of-the-art technologies by moving from standard concept-based exploration to statement-based exploration. The proposed scheme utilizes the textual entailment relation between statements as the basis of the exploration process. A user of our system can explore the result space of a query by drilling down/up from one statement to another, according to entailment relations specified by an entailment graph and an optional concept taxonomy. As a prominent use case, we apply our exploration system and illustrate its benefit on the health-care domain. To the best of our knowledge this is the first implementation of an exploration system at the statement level that is based on the textual entailment relation. 1</p><p>5 0.51194191 <a title="133-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-WizIE%3A_A_Best_Practices_Guided_Development_Environment_for_Information_Extraction.html">215 acl-2012-WizIE: A Best Practices Guided Development Environment for Information Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Yunyao Li ; Laura Chiticariu ; Huahai Yang ; Frederick Reiss ; Arnaldo Carreno-fuentes</p><p>Abstract: Information extraction (IE) is becoming a critical building block in many enterprise applications. In order to satisfy the increasing text analytics demands of enterprise applications, it is crucial to enable developers with general computer science background to develop high quality IE extractors. In this demonstration, we present WizIE, an IE development environment intended to reduce the development life cycle and enable developers with little or no linguistic background to write high quality IE rules. WizI E provides an integrated wizard-like environment that guides IE developers step-by-step throughout the entire development process, based on best practices synthesized from the experience of expert developers. In addition, WizIE reduces the manual effort involved in performing key IE development tasks by offering automatic result explanation and rule discovery functionality. Preliminary results indicate that WizI E is a step forward towards enabling extractor development for novice IE developers.</p><p>6 0.49739066 <a title="133-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-Learning_High-Level_Planning_from_Text.html">129 acl-2012-Learning High-Level Planning from Text</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuening Hu ; Jordan Boyd-Graber</p><p>Abstract: Topic modeling with a tree-based prior has been used for a variety of applications because it can encode correlations between words that traditional topic modeling cannot. However, its expressive power comes at the cost of more complicated inference. We extend the SPARSELDA (Yao et al., 2009) inference scheme for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to tree-based topic models. This sampling scheme computes the exact conditional distribution for Gibbs sampling much more quickly than enumerating all possible latent variable assignments. We further improve performance by iteratively refining the sampling distribution only when needed. Experiments show that the proposed techniques dramatically improve the computation time.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.63068938 <a title="133-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Learning_to_%22Read_Between_the_Lines%22_using_Bayesian_Logic_Programs.html">133 acl-2012-Learning to "Read Between the Lines" using Bayesian Logic Programs</a></p>

<p>Author: Limin Yao ; Sebastian Riedel ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: To discover relation types from text, most methods cluster shallow or syntactic patterns of relation mentions, but consider only one possible sense per pattern. In practice this assumption is often violated. In this paper we overcome this issue by inducing clusters of pattern senses from feature representations of patterns. In particular, we employ a topic model to partition entity pairs associated with patterns into sense clusters using local and global features. We merge these sense clusters into semantic relations using hierarchical agglomerative clustering. We compare against several baselines: a generative latent-variable model, a clustering method that does not disambiguate between path senses, and our own approach but with only local features. Experimental results show our proposed approach discovers dramatically more accurate clusters than models without sense disambiguation, and that incorporating global features, such as the document theme, is crucial.</p><p>5 0.44933206 <a title="133-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Online_Plagiarized_Detection_Through_Exploiting_Lexical%2C_Syntax%2C_and_Semantic_Information.html">156 acl-2012-Online Plagiarized Detection Through Exploiting Lexical, Syntax, and Semantic Information</a></p>

Results demonstrate that our system can not only find considerable amount of real-world online plagiarism cases but also outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms and commercial software. Keywords Plagiarism Detection, Lexical, Syntactic, Semantic 1.</p><p>6 0.44545317 <a title="133-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Crosslingual_Induction_of_Semantic_Roles.html">64 acl-2012-Crosslingual Induction of Semantic Roles</a></p>

</p><p>6 At the same time, because n-gram language models only condition on a local window of linear word-level context, they are poor models of long-range syntactic dependencies. [sent-9, score-0.276]
</p><p>7 Although several lines of work have proposed generative syntactic language models that improve on n-gram models for moderate amounts of data (Chelba, 1997; Xu et al. [sent-10, score-0.37]
</p><p>8 , 2002; Charniak, 2001 ; Hall, 2004; Roark, 959 2004), these models have only recently been scaled to the impressive amounts of data routinely used by n-gram language models (Tan et al. [sent-11, score-0.189]
</p><p>9 In this paper, we describe a generative, syntactic language model that conditions on local context treelets1 in a parse tree, backing off to smaller  treelets as necessary. [sent-13, score-0.385]
</p><p>10 Our model can be trained simply by collecting counts and using the same smoothing techniques normally applied to n-gram models (Kneser and Ney, 1995), enabling us to apply techniques developed for scaling n-gram models out of the box (Brants et al. [sent-14, score-0.333]
</p><p>11 The simplicity of our training procedure allows us to train a model on a billion tokens of data in a matter of hours on a single machine, which compares favorably to the more involved training algorithm of Tan et al. [sent-16, score-0.122]
</p><p>12 The simplicity of our approach also contrasts with recent work on language modeling with tree substitution grammars (Post and Gildea, 2009), where larger treelet contexts are incorporated by using sophisticated priors to learn a segmentation of parse trees. [sent-18, score-0.41]
</p><p>13 We also evaluate our model on several grammaticality tasks proposed in 1We borrow  the term treelet from Quirk et al. [sent-22, score-0.551]

</p><p>19 Parent rule context has also been employed in translation (Vaswani et al. [sent-91, score-0.141]
</p><p>20 To capture linear effects, we extend the context for terminal (lexical) productions to include –  the previous two words w−2 and w−1 in the sentence in addition to r0; see Figure 1(c) for a depiction. [sent-96, score-0.236]

</p><p>24 There is one additional hurdle in the estimation of our model: while there exist corpora with humanannotated constituency parses like the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. [sent-115, score-0.212]
</p><p>25 These parses may contain errors, but not all parsing errors are problematic for our model, since we only care about the sentences generated by our model and not the parses themselves. [sent-120, score-0.303]
</p><p>26 We show in our experiments that the addition of data with automatic parses does improve the performance of our language models across a range of tasks. [sent-121, score-0.144]
</p><p>27 –  3  Tree Transformations  –  In the previous section, we described how to condition on rich parse context to better capture the distribution of English trees. [sent-122, score-0.143]
</p><p>28 While such context allows our model to capture many interesting dependencies, several important dependencies require additional attention. [sent-123, score-0.126]
</p><p>29 today  Figure 2: A sample parse from the Penn Treebank after the tree transformations described in Section 3. [sent-126, score-0.133]
</p><p>30 Note that we have not shown head tag annotations on preterminals because in that case, the head tag is the preterminal itself. [sent-127, score-0.344]
</p><p>31 number of transformations of Treebank constituency parses that allow us to capture such dependencies. [sent-128, score-0.228]
</p><p>32 Instead, we mark any noun that is the head of a NP-TMP constituent at least once in the Treebank as a temporal noun, so for example today would be tagged as NNT and months would be tagged as NNTS. [sent-133, score-0.129]
</p><p>33 Head Annotations We annotate every non-terminal or preterminal with its head word if the head is a closedclass word3 and with its head tag otherwise. [sent-134, score-0.523]
</p><p>34 Klein and Manning (2003) used head tag annotation extensively, though they applied their splits much more selectively. [sent-135, score-0.177]
</p><p>35 By removing the dominated NP, we allow the production NNS→sales to condition on the presence of a modifying PP (here a PP head-annotated with by). [sent-138, score-0.14]
</p><p>36 962 MX for numbers that mix letters and digits; and CD-AL for numbers that are entirely alphabetic. [sent-140, score-0.092]
</p><p>37 SBAR Flattening We remove any sentential (S) nodes immediately dominated by an SBAR. [sent-141, score-0.145]
</p><p>38 S nodes under SBAR have very distinct distributions from other sentential nodes, mostly due to empty subjects and/or objects. [sent-142, score-0.096]
</p><p>39 By flattening such structures, we allow the main verb and its arguments to condition on the whole chain of verbs. [sent-147, score-0.206]
</p><p>40 Gapped Sentence Annotation Collins (1999) and Klein and Manning (2003) annotate nodes which have empty subjects. [sent-149, score-0.146]
</p><p>41 We use a very simple  procedure: we annotate all S or SBAR nodes that have a VP before any NPs. [sent-151, score-0.098]
</p><p>42 Parent Annotation We annotate all VPs with their parent symbol. [sent-152, score-0.168]
</p><p>43 Because our treelet model already conditions on the parent, this has the effect of allowing verbs to condition on their grandparents. [sent-153, score-0.508]
</p><p>44 Unary Deletion We remove all unary productions except the root and preterminal productions, keeping only the bottom-most symbol. [sent-156, score-0.261]
</p><p>45 For machine translation, a model that builds target-side constituency parses, such as that of Galley et al. [sent-161, score-0.147]
</p><p>46 In Table 1, we show the first four samples of length between 15 and 20 generated from our model and a 5-gram model trained on the Penn Treebank. [sent-176, score-0.197]
</p><p>47 4We found that using the 1-best worked just as well as the 1000-best on our grammaticality tasks, but significantly overestimated our model’s perplexities. [sent-177, score-0.134]
</p><p>48 For training data, we constructed a large treebank by concatenating the WSJ and Brown portions of the Penn Treebank, the 50K BLLIP training sentences from Post (201 1), and the AFP and APW portions of English Gigaword version 3 (Graff, 2003), totaling about 1. [sent-182, score-0.139]
</p><p>49 We used the humanannotated parses for the sentences in the Penn Treebank, but parsed the Gigaword and BLLIP sentences with the Berkeley Parser. [sent-184, score-0.241]
</p><p>50 TREELET-RULE The TREELET-TRANS model with the parent rule context described in Section 2. [sent-193, score-0.244]
</p><p>51 This is equivalent to the full TREELET model without the lexical context described in Section 2. [sent-194, score-0.126]
</p><p>52 6Specifically, like Collins Model 1, we generate a rule yield conditioned on parent symbol P and head word h by first generating its head symbol Ch, then generating the head words and symbols for left and right modifiers outwards from Ch. [sent-196, score-0.591]
</p><p>53 Unlike Model 1, which generates each modifier head and symbol conditioned only on Ch, h, and P, we additionally condition on the previously generated modifier’s head and symbol and back off to Model 1. [sent-197, score-0.49]
</p><p>54 PCFG-LA (marked with **) was only trained on the WSJ and Brown corpora  because it does not scale to large amounts of data. [sent-200, score-0.128]
</p><p>55 We used the Berkeley LM toolkit (Pauls and Klein, 2011), which implements Kneser-Ney smoothing, to estimate all back-off models for both n-gram and treelet models. [sent-201, score-0.398]
</p><p>56 Our model outperforms all other generative models, though the improvement over the n-gram model is not statistically significant. [sent-203, score-0.302]
</p><p>57 3 Classification of Pseudo-Negative Sentences We make use of three kinds of automatically generated pseudo-negative sentences previously proposed in the literature: Okanohara and Tsujii (2007) proposed generating pseudo-negative examples from a trigram language model; Foster et al. [sent-206, score-0.171]
</p><p>58 (2008) create “noisy” sentences by automatically inserting a single error into grammatical sentences with a script  that randomly deletes, inserts, or misspells a word; and Och et al. [sent-207, score-0.102]
</p><p>59 We evaluate our model’s ability to distinguish positive from pseudonegative data, and compare against generative baselines and state-of-the-art discriminative methods. [sent-210, score-0.289]
</p><p>60 We would like to use our model to make grammaticality judgements, but as a generative model it can only provide us with probabilities. [sent-218, score-0.388]
</p><p>61 Simply thresholding generative probabilities, even with a separate threshold for each length, has been shown to be very ineffective for grammaticality judgements, both for  n-gram and syntactic language models (Cherry and Quirk, 2008; Post, 2011). [sent-219, score-0.37]
</p><p>62 We used a simple measure for isolating the syntactic likelihood of a sentence: we take the log-probability under our model and subtract the log-probability under a unigram model, then normalize by the length of the sentence. [sent-220, score-0.195]
</p><p>63 8 This measure, which we call the syntactic log-odds ratio (SLR), is a crude way of “subtracting out” the semantic component of the generative probability, so that sentences that use rare words are not penalized for doing so. [sent-221, score-0.232]
</p><p>64 1 Trigram Classification To facilitate comparison with previous work, we used the same negative corpora as Post (201 1) for trigram classification. [sent-224, score-0.164]
</p><p>65 They randomly selected 50K train, 3K development, and 3K positive test sentences from the BLLIP corpus, then trained a trigram model on 450K BLLIP sentences and generated 50K train, 3K development, and 3K negative sentences. [sent-225, score-0.389]
</p><p>66 We parsed the 50K positive training examples of Post (201 1) with the Berkeley Parser and used the resulting treebank to train a treelet language model. [sent-226, score-0.431]
</p><p>67 We set an SLR threshold for each model on  the 6K positive and negative development sentences. [sent-227, score-0.118]
</p><p>68 In addition to our generative baselines, we show results for the discriminative models reported in Cherry and Quirk (2008) and Post (201 1). [sent-229, score-0.235]
</p><p>69 We assume this is either because the lengthnormalization is important, or because their choice of syntactic language model was poor. [sent-233, score-0.149]
</p><p>70 The number reported for PCFG-LA is marked with a * to indicate that this model was trained on the training section of the WSJ, not the BLLIP corpus. [sent-235, score-0.172]
</p><p>71 Our TREELET model performs nearly as well as the TSG method, and substantially  outperforms  the  LSVM method, though the latter was not tested on  the same random split. [sent-238, score-0.122]
</p><p>72 This is likely because the negative data is largely coherent at the trigram level (because it was generated from a trigram model), and the full model is much more sensitive to trigram coherence than the TREELET-RULE model. [sent-240, score-0.534]
</p><p>73 We emphasize that the discriminative baselines are specifically trained to separate trigram text from natural English, while our model is trained on positive examples alone. [sent-242, score-0.418]
</p><p>74 Unlike some of the discriminative baselines, which require expensive operations9 on 9It is true that in order train our system, one must parse large amounts of training data, which can be costly, though it only needs to be done once. [sent-245, score-0.201]
</p><p>75 In contrast, even with observed training trees, the discriminative algorithms must still iteratively perform expensive operations (like parsing) for each sentence, and a new model must be trained for new types of negative data. [sent-246, score-0.241]
</p><p>76 “Pairwise” accuracy is the fraction of correct sentences whose SLR score was higher than its noisy version, and “independent” refers to standard binary classification accuracy. [sent-248, score-0.151]
</p><p>77 each training sentence, we can very easily scale our model to much larger amounts of data. [sent-249, score-0.153]
</p><p>78 In Table 4, we also show the performance of the generative models trained on our 1B corpus. [sent-250, score-0.21]
</p><p>79 All generative models improve, but TREELET-RULE remains the best, now outperforming the RERANK system, though of course it is likely that RERANK would improve if it could be scaled up to more training data. [sent-251, score-0.209]
</p><p>80 2 “Noisy” Classification We also evaluate the performance of our model on the task of distinguishing the noisy WSJ sentences of Foster et al. [sent-254, score-0.172]
</p><p>81 Because they only report classification results on Section 0, we used Section 23 to tune an SLR threshold, and tested our model on Section 0. [sent-257, score-0.127]
</p><p>82 We show the results of both independent and pairwise classification for the WSJ and 1B training sets in Table 5. [sent-258, score-0.137]
</p><p>83 Note that independent classification is much more difficult than for the trigram data, because sentences contain at most one change, which may not even result in an ungrammaticality. [sent-259, score-0.224]
</p><p>84 Again, our model outperforms the n-gram model for both types of classification, and achieves the same performance as the discriminative system of Foster et al. [sent-260, score-0.222]
</p><p>85 The TREELET-RULE system again slightly outperforms the full TREELET model at independent classification, though not at pairwise classification. [sent-262, score-0.206]
</p><p>86 This probably reflects the fact that semantic coherence can still influence the SLR score, despite our efforts  to subtract it out. [sent-263, score-0.102]
</p><p>87 9% on a similar experiment with German a source language, though the translation system and training data were different so the numbers are not comparable. [sent-274, score-0.183]
</p><p>88 For pairwise comparisons, where semantic coherence is effectively held constant, such sentences are not problematic. [sent-277, score-0.191]
</p><p>89 (2004) and Cherry and Quirk  (2008) in evaluating our language models on their ability to distinguish the 1-best output of a machine translation system from a reference translation in a pairwise fashion. [sent-281, score-0.317]
</p><p>90 , 2009) trained on 500K sentences of GALE Chinese-English parallel newswire. [sent-286, score-0.1]
</p><p>91 We trained both our TREELET model and a 5-GRAM model on the union of our 1B corpus and the English sides of our parallel corpora. [sent-287, score-0.197]
</p><p>92 org/wmt09  11We note that the n-gram language model used by the MT system was much smaller than the 5-GRAM model, as they were only trained on the English sides of their parallel data. [sent-293, score-0.123]
</p><p>93 966 fect language model might not be able to differentiate such translations from their references. [sent-294, score-0.133]
</p><p>94 4 Machine Translation Fluency We also carried out reranking experiments on 1000best lists from Moses using our syntactic language model as a feature. [sent-296, score-0.149]
</p><p>95 We did not find that the use of our syntactic language model made any statistically significant increases in BLEU score. [sent-297, score-0.149]
</p><p>96 However, we noticed in general that the translations favored by our model were more fluent, a useful improvement to which BLEU is often insensitive. [sent-298, score-0.133]
</p><p>97 To confirm this, we carried out an Amazon Mechanical Turk experiment where users from the United States were asked to compare translations using our TREELET language model as the language model feature to those using the 5-GRAM model. [sent-299, score-0.207]
</p><p>98 6  Conclusion  We have presented a simple syntactic language model that can be estimated using standard n-gram smoothing techniques on large amounts of data. [sent-304, score-0.277]
</p><p>99 Our model outperforms generative baselines on several evaluation metrics and achieves the same performance as state-of-the-art discriminative classifiers specifically trained on several types of negative data. [sent-305, score-0.399]

<p>Author: Hiroyuki Shindo ; Yusuke Miyao ; Akinori Fujino ; Masaaki Nagata</p><p>Abstract: We propose Symbol-Refined Tree Substitution Grammars (SR-TSGs) for syntactic parsing.

<p>Author: Hui Zhang ; David Chiang</p><p>Abstract: Syntax-based translation models that operate on the output of a source-language parser have been shown to perform better if allowed to choose from a set of possible parses. In this paper, we investigate whether this is because it allows the translation stage to overcome parser errors or to override the syntactic structure itself. We find that it is primarily the latter, but that under the right conditions, the translation stage does correct parser errors, improving parsing accuracy on the Chinese Treebank.</p><p>5 0.14258136 <a title="127-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-NiuTrans%3A_An_Open_Source_Toolkit_for_Phrase-based_and_Syntax-based_Machine_Translation.html">155 acl-2012-NiuTrans: An Open Source Toolkit for Phrase-based and Syntax-based Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Xiao ; Jingbo Zhu ; Hao Zhang ; Qiang Li</p><p>Abstract: We present a new open source toolkit for phrase-based and syntax-based machine translation. The toolkit supports several state-of-the-art models developed in statistical machine translation, including the phrase-based model, the hierachical phrase-based model, and various syntaxbased models. The key innovation provided by the toolkit is that the decoder can work with various grammars and offers different choices of decoding algrithms, such as phrase-based decoding, decoding as parsing/tree-parsing and forest-based decoding. Moreover, several useful utilities were distributed with the toolkit, including a discriminative reordering model, a simple and fast language model, and an implementation of minimum error rate training for weight tuning. 1</p><p>6 0.14049426 <a title="127-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-A_Comparative_Study_of_Target_Dependency_Structures_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">4 acl-2012-A Comparative Study of Target Dependency Structures for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

We evaluate on perplexity and a range of grammaticality tasks, and find that we perform as well or better than n-gram models and other generative baselines. Our model even competes with state-of-the-art discriminative models hand-designed for the grammaticality tasks, despite training on positive data alone.

<p>Author: William Yang Wang ; Elijah Mayfield ; Suresh Naidu ; Jeremiah Dittmar</p><p>Abstract: We propose a latent variable model to enhance historical analysis of large corpora. This work extends prior work in topic modelling by incorporating metadata, and the interactions between the components in metadata, in a general way. To test this, we collect a corpus of slavery-related United States property law judgements sampled from the years 1730 to 1866. We study the language use in these legal cases, with a special focus on shifts in opinions on controversial topics across different regions. Because this is a longitudinal data set, we are also interested in understanding how these opinions change over the course of decades. We show that the joint learning scheme of our sparse mixed-effects model improves on other state-of-the-art generative and discriminative models on the region and time period identification tasks. Experiments show that our sparse mixed-effects model is more accurate quantitatively and qualitatively interesting, and that these improvements are robust across different parameter settings.</p><p>3 0.72076482 <a title="127-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-A_Topic_Similarity_Model_for_Hierarchical_Phrase-based_Translation.html">22 acl-2012-A Topic Similarity Model for Hierarchical Phrase-based Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinyan Xiao ; Deyi Xiong ; Min Zhang ; Qun Liu ; Shouxun Lin</p><p>Abstract: Previous work using topic model for statistical machine translation (SMT) explore topic information at the word level. However, SMT has been advanced from word-based paradigm to phrase/rule-based paradigm. We therefore propose a topic similarity model to exploit topic information at the synchronous rule level for hierarchical phrase-based translation. We associate each synchronous rule with a topic distribution, and select desirable rules according to the similarity of their topic distributions with given documents. We show that our model significantly improves the translation performance over the baseline on NIST Chinese-to-English translation experiments. Our model also achieves a better performance and a faster speed than previous approaches that work at the word level.</p><p>4 0.72034997 <a title="127-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-Modified_Distortion_Matrices_for_Phrase-Based_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">148 acl-2012-Modified Distortion Matrices for Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Arianna Bisazza ; Marcello Federico</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel method to suggest long word reorderings to a phrase-based SMT decoder. We address language pairs where long reordering concentrates on few patterns, and use fuzzy chunk-based rules to predict likely reorderings for these phenomena. Then we use reordered n-gram LMs to rank the resulting permutations and select the n-best for translation. Finally we encode these reorderings by modifying selected entries of the distortion cost matrix, on a per-sentence basis. In this way, we expand the search space by a much finer degree than if we simply raised the distortion limit. The proposed techniques are tested on Arabic-English and German-English using well-known SMT benchmarks.</p><p>5 0.71946675 <a title="127-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Joint_Feature_Selection_in_Distributed_Stochastic_Learning_for_Large-Scale_Discriminative_Training_in_SMT.html">123 acl-2012-Joint Feature Selection in Distributed Stochastic Learning for Large-Scale Discriminative Training in SMT</a></p>

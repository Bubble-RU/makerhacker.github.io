<p>Author: Rui Yan ; Mirella Lapata ; Xiaoming Li</p><p>Abstract: Mirella Lapata‡ Xiaoming Li†, \ ‡Institute for Language, \State Key Laboratory of Software Cognition and Computation, Development Environment, University of Edinburgh, Beihang University, Edinburgh EH8 9AB, UK Beijing 100083, China mlap@ inf .ed .ac .uk lxm@pku .edu .cn 2012.1 Twitter enables users to send and read textbased posts ofup to 140 characters, known as tweets. As one of the most popular micro-blogging services, Twitter attracts millions of users, producing millions of tweets daily. Shared information through this service spreads faster than would have been possible with traditional sources, however the proliferation of user-generation content poses challenges to browsing and finding valuable information. In this paper we propose a graph-theoretic model for tweet recommendation that presents users with items they may have an interest in. Our model ranks tweets and their authors simultaneously using several networks: the social network connecting the users, the network connecting the tweets, and a third network that ties the two together. Tweet and author entities are ranked following a co-ranking algorithm based on the intuition that that there is a mutually reinforcing relationship between tweets and their authors that could be reflected in the rankings. We show that this framework can be parametrized to take into account user preferences, the popularity of tweets and their authors, and diversity. Experimental evaluation on a large dataset shows that our model out- performs competitive approaches by a large margin.</p><p>3 0.48250717 <a title="167-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-A_System_for_Real-time_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_of_2012_U.S._Presidential_Election_Cycle.html">21 acl-2012-A System for Real-time Twitter Sentiment Analysis of 2012 U.S. Presidential Election Cycle</a></p>
<p>Author: Hao Wang ; Dogan Can ; Abe Kazemzadeh ; Francois Bar ; Shrikanth Narayanan</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a system for real-time analysis of public sentiment toward presidential candidates in the 2012 U.S. election as expressed on Twitter, a microblogging service. Twitter has become a central site where people express their opinions and views on political parties and candidates. Emerging events or news are often followed almost instantly by a burst in Twitter volume, providing a unique opportunity to gauge the relation between expressed public sentiment and electoral events. In addition, sentiment analysis can help explore how these events affect public opinion. While traditional content analysis takes days or weeks to complete, the system demonstrated here analyzes sentiment in the entire Twitter traffic about the election, delivering results instantly and continuously. It offers the public, the media, politicians and scholars a new and timely perspective on the dynamics of the electoral process and public opinion. 1</p><p>4 0.4742254 <a title="167-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Joint_Inference_of_Named_Entity_Recognition_and_Normalization_for_Tweets.html">124 acl-2012-Joint Inference of Named Entity Recognition and Normalization for Tweets</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaohua Liu ; Ming Zhou ; Xiangyang Zhou ; Zhongyang Fu ; Furu Wei</p><p>Abstract: Tweets represent a critical source of fresh information, in which named entities occur frequently with rich variations. We study the problem of named entity normalization (NEN) for tweets. Two main challenges are the errors propagated from named entity recognition (NER) and the dearth of information in a single tweet. We propose a novel graphical model to simultaneously conduct NER and NEN on multiple tweets to address these challenges. Particularly, our model introduces a binary random variable for each pair of words with the same lemma across similar tweets, whose value indicates whether the two related words are mentions of the same entity. We evaluate our method on a manually annotated data set, and show that our method outperforms the baseline that handles these two tasks separately, boosting the F1 from 80.2% to 83.6% for NER, and the Accuracy from 79.4% to 82.6% for NEN, respectively.</p><p>5 0.27705613 <a title="167-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Extracting_and_modeling_durations_for_habits_and_events_from_Twitter.html">91 acl-2012-Extracting and modeling durations for habits and events from Twitter</a></p>
<p>Author: Jennifer Williams ; Graham Katz</p><p>Abstract: We seek to automatically estimate typical durations for events and habits described in Twitter tweets. A corpus of more than 14 million tweets containing temporal duration information was collected. These tweets were classified as to their habituality status using a bootstrapped, decision tree. For each verb lemma, associated duration information was collected for episodic and habitual uses of the verb. Summary statistics for 483 verb lemmas and their typical habit and episode durations has been compiled and made available. This automatically generated duration information is broadly comparable to hand-annotation. 1</p><p>6 0.14834677 <a title="167-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Self-Disclosure_and_Relationship_Strength_in_Twitter_Conversations.html">173 acl-2012-Self-Disclosure and Relationship Strength in Twitter Conversations</a></p>

<p>Author: Xinfan Meng ; Furu Wei ; Xiaohua Liu ; Ming Zhou ; Ge Xu ; Houfeng Wang</p><p>Abstract: The amount of labeled sentiment data in English is much larger than that in other languages. Such a disproportion arouse interest in cross-lingual sentiment classification, which aims to conduct sentiment classification in the target language (e.g. Chinese) using labeled data in the source language (e.g. English). Most existing work relies on machine translation engines to directly adapt labeled data from the source language to the target language. This approach suffers from the limited coverage of vocabulary in the machine translation results. In this paper, we propose a generative cross-lingual mixture model (CLMM) to leverage unlabeled bilingual parallel data. By fitting parameters to maximize the likelihood of the bilingual parallel data, the proposed model learns previously unseen sentiment words from the large bilingual parallel data and improves vocabulary coverage signifi- cantly. Experiments on multiple data sets show that CLMM is consistently effective in two settings: (1) labeled data in the target language are unavailable; and (2) labeled data in the target language are also available.</p><p>4 0.47581288 <a title="167-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-A_System_for_Real-time_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_of_2012_U.S._Presidential_Election_Cycle.html">21 acl-2012-A System for Real-time Twitter Sentiment Analysis of 2012 U.S. Presidential Election Cycle</a></p>
<p>Author: Hao Wang ; Dogan Can ; Abe Kazemzadeh ; Francois Bar ; Shrikanth Narayanan</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a system for real-time analysis of public sentiment toward presidential candidates in the 2012 U.S. election as expressed on Twitter, a microblogging service. Twitter has become a central site where people express their opinions and views on political parties and candidates. Emerging events or news are often followed almost instantly by a burst in Twitter volume, providing a unique opportunity to gauge the relation between expressed public sentiment and electoral events. In addition, sentiment analysis can help explore how these events affect public opinion. While traditional content analysis takes days or weeks to complete, the system demonstrated here analyzes sentiment in the entire Twitter traffic about the election, delivering results instantly and continuously. It offers the public, the media, politicians and scholars a new and timely perspective on the dynamics of the electoral process and public opinion. 1</p><p>5 0.4449282 <a title="167-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-The_Creation_of_a_Corpus_of_English_Metalanguage.html">195 acl-2012-The Creation of a Corpus of English Metalanguage</a></p>
<p>Author: Shomir Wilson</p><p>Abstract: Metalanguage is an essential linguistic mechanism which allows us to communicate explicit information about language itself. However, it has been underexamined in research in language technologies, to the detriment of the performance of systems that could exploit it. This paper describes the creation of the first tagged and delineated corpus of English metalanguage, accompanied by an explicit definition and a rubric for identifying the phenomenon in text. This resource will provide a basis for further studies of metalanguage and enable its utilization in language technologies.</p><p>6 0.44343045 <a title="167-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Crosslingual_Induction_of_Semantic_Roles.html">64 acl-2012-Crosslingual Induction of Semantic Roles</a></p>

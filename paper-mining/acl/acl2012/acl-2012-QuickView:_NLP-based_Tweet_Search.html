We present QuickView, an NLP-based tweet search platform to tackle this issue.

</p><p>2 We present QuickView, an NLP-based tweet search platform to tackle this issue. [sent-4, score-0.509]
</p><p>3 Specifically, it exploits a series of natural language processing technologies, such as tweet normalization, named entity recognition, semantic role labeling, sentiment analysis, tweet classification, to extract useful information, i. [sent-5, score-0.978]
</p><p>4 Then, non-noisy tweets, together with the mined information, are indexed, on top of which two brand new scenarios are enabled, i. [sent-9, score-0.139]
</p><p>5 , categorized browsing and advanced search, allowing users to effectively access  either the tweets or fine-grained information they are interested in. [sent-11, score-0.762]
</p><p>6 However, users often have difficulty finding information they are interested in from tweets, because of the huge number of tweets as well as their noisy and informal nature. [sent-13, score-0.674]
</p><p>7 , Twitter 1, is a kind of service aiming to tackle this issue. [sent-16, score-0.027]
</p><p>8 For example, in Twitter, only a simple keyword-based search is sup1http://twitter. [sent-18, score-0.065]
</p><p>9 This demonstration introduces QuickView, which employs a series of NLP technologies to extract useful information from a large volume of tweets. [sent-20, score-0.046]
</p><p>10 Specifically, for each tweet, it first conducts normalization, followed by named entity recognition  (NER). [sent-21, score-0.125]
</p><p>11 Then it conducts semantic role labeling (SRL) to get predicate-argument structures, which are further converted into events, i. [sent-22, score-0.146]
</p><p>12 Finally, non-noisy tweets together with the mined information are indexed. [sent-29, score-0.577]
</p><p>13 On top of the index, QuickView enables two brand new scenarios, allowing users to effectively access the tweets or fine-grained information mined from tweets. [sent-30, score-0.679]
</p><p>14 As illustrated in Figure 1(a), QuickView shows recent popular tweets, entities, events, opinions and so on, which are organized by categories. [sent-32, score-0.083]
</p><p>15 It also extracts and classifies URL links in tweets and allows users to check out popular links in a categorized way. [sent-33, score-0.642]
</p><p>16 , search tweets containing any positive/negative opinion about “Obama” or any event involving “Obama”. [sent-40, score-0.636]
</p><p>17 The implementation of QuickView requires adapting existing NLP components trained on formal texts, which often performs poorly on tweets. [sent-41, score-0.108]
</p><p>18 However, the adaptation of those components is challenging, owing to the lack of annotated tweets and the inadequate signals provided by a noisy and  short tweet. [sent-49, score-0.755]
</p><p>19 Our general strategy is to leverage existing resources as well as unsupervised or semisupervised learning methods to reduce the labeling efforts, and to aggregate as much evidence as possible from a broader context to compensate for the lack of information in a tweet. [sent-50, score-0.128]
</p><p>20 This strategy is embodied by various components we have developed. [sent-51, score-0.071]
</p><p>21 For example, our NER component combines a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier, which collects global information across recently labeled tweets with a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) labeler, which exploits information from a single tweet and the gazetteers. [sent-52, score-1.083]
</p><p>22 Both the KNN classifier and the CRF labeler are repeatedly retrained using the results that they have confidently labeled. [sent-53, score-0.207]
</p><p>23 The SRL component caches and clusters recent labeled tweets, and aggregates information from the cluster containing the tweet. [sent-54, score-0.15]
</p><p>24 Similarly, the classifier considers not only the current tweet but also its neighbors in a tweet graph, where two tweets are connected if they are similar in content or have a tweet/retweet relationship. [sent-55, score-1.423]
</p><p>25 Experimental  results on a human annotated dataset also indicate the effectiveness of our adaptation strategy. [sent-57, score-0.071]
</p><p>26 We demonstrate  QuickView,  an NLP-based  14 tweet search. [sent-60, score-0.417]
</p><p>27 Different from existing methods, it exploits a series of NLP technologies to extract useful information from a large volume of tweets, and enables categorized browsing and advanced search scenarios, allowing users to efficiently access information they are interested in from tweets. [sent-61, score-0.392]
</p><p>28 We present core components of QuickView, focusing on how to leverage existing resources and technologies as well as how to make up for the limited information in a short and often noisy tweet by aggregating information from a broader context. [sent-63, score-0.708]
</p><p>29 However, unlike existing IE systems, such as Evita (Saur ´ı et al. [sent-71, score-0.037]
</p><p>30 , 2005), a robust event recognizer for QA system, and SRES (Rozenfeld and Feldman, 2008), a self-supervised relation extractor for the web, it targets tweets, a new genre of text, which are short and informal, and its focus is on adapting existing IE components to tweets. [sent-72, score-0.159]
</p><p>31 A couple of tweet search services exist, including Twitter, Bing social search 2 and Google social search 3. [sent-74, score-0.637]
</p><p>32 Most of them provide only keyword-based search interfaces, i. [sent-75, score-0.065]
</p><p>33 , returning a list of tweets related to a given word/phrase. [sent-77, score-0.543]
</p><p>34 In contrast, our system extracts fine-grained information from tweets and allows a new end-toend search experience beyond keyword search, such as clustering of search results, and search with events/opinions. [sent-78, score-0.738]
</p><p>35 At the heart of our system is the re-use of existing resources, methodologies as 2http://www. [sent-83, score-0.068]

</p><p>38 well as components, and the the adaptation of them to tweets. [sent-90, score-0.048]
</p><p>39 3  System Description  We first give an overview of our system, then present more details about NER and SRL, as two representative core components, to illustrate the adaptation process. [sent-92, score-0.099]
</p><p>40 QuickView can be divided into four parts, as illustrated in Figure 2. [sent-95, score-0.027]
</p><p>41 The first part includes a crawler and a buffer of raw tweets. [sent-96, score-0.134]
</p><p>42 The crawler repeatedly downloads tweets using the Twitter APIs, and then pre-filters noisy tweets using some heuristic rules, e. [sent-97, score-1.194]
</p><p>43 , removing a tweet if it is too short, say, less than 3 words, or if it contains any predefined banned word. [sent-99, score-0.417]
</p><p>44 At the moment, we focus on English tweets, so non-English tweets are filtered as well. [sent-100, score-0.543]
</p><p>45 The second part consists of several tweet extraction pipelines. [sent-102, score-0.44]
</p><p>46 Each pipeline has the same configuration, constantly fetching a tweet from the raw tweet  buffer, and conducting the following processes se-  quentially: 1) normalization; 2) parsing including part-of-speech (POS), chunking, and dependency parsing; 3) NER; 4) SRL; 5) SA and 6) classification. [sent-103, score-0.861]
</p><p>47 In future, the parsing model will be re-trained using annotated tweets. [sent-109, score-0.023]
</p><p>48 The SA component is implemented according to Jiang et al. [sent-110, score-0.043]
</p><p>49 (201 1), which incorporates target-dependent features and considers related tweets by utilizing a graph-based optimization. [sent-111, score-0.543]
</p><p>50 The classification model is a KNN-based classifier that caches confidently labeled results to re-train itself, which also recognizes and drops noisy tweets. [sent-112, score-0.206]
</p><p>51 net/projects/opennlp/ 16 Each processed tweet, if not identified as noise, is put into a shared buffer for indexing. [sent-119, score-0.125]
</p><p>52 The third part is responsible for indexing and querying. [sent-120, score-0.023]
</p><p>53 It constantly takes from the indexing buffer a processed tweet, which is then indexed with various entries including words, phrases, metadata (e. [sent-121, score-0.222]
</p><p>54 , source, publish time, and account), named entities, events, and opinions. [sent-123, score-0.035]
</p><p>55 On top ofthis, it answers any search request, and returns a list of matched results, each of which contains both the original tweet and the extracted information from that tweet. [sent-124, score-0.513]
</p><p>56 This part also maintains a cache of recent processed tweets, from which the following information is extracted and indexed: 1) top tweets; 2) top entities/events/opinions in tweets; and 3) top accounts. [sent-126, score-0.12]
</p><p>57 Whether a tweet/entity/event/opinion ranks top depends on their re-tweeted/mentioned times as well as its publisher, while whether an account is top relies on the number of his/her followers and tweets. [sent-127, score-0.062]
</p><p>58 The fourth part is a web application that returns related information to end users according to their browsing or search request. [sent-128, score-0.163]
</p><p>59 The implementation of the web application is organized with the modelview-control pattern so that other kinds of user interfaces, e. [sent-129, score-0.029]
</p><p>60 QuickView is deployed into 5 workstations 7 including 2 processing pipelines, as illustrated in Table 1. [sent-133, score-0.054]
</p><p>61 01 seconds to process each tweet, and in total about 10 million tweets are indexed every day. [sent-136, score-0.59]
</p><p>62 2 Core Components Because of limited space, we only discuss two core components of QuickView: NER and SRL. [sent-139, score-0.122]

</p><p>65 With the availability of annotated corpora, such as ACE05, Enron and CoNLL03, the data-driven methods become the dominating methods. [sent-150, score-0.023]
</p><p>66 Firstly, it defines those recently labeled tweets that are similar to the current tweet as its recognition context, under which a KNN-  based classifier is used to conduct word level classification. [sent-153, score-1.015]
</p><p>67 Following the two-stage prediction aggregation methods (Krishnan and Manning, 2006), such pre-labeled results, together with other conventional features used by the state-of-the-art NER systems, are fed into a linear CRF models, which conducts fine-grained tweet level NER. [sent-154, score-0.482]
</p><p>68 Secondly, the KNN and CRF model are repeatedly retrained with an incrementally augmented training set, into which highly confidently labeled tweets are added. [sent-155, score-0.716]
</p><p>69 Finally, following Lev Ratinov and Dan Roth (2009), 30 gazetteers are used, which cover common names, countries, locations, temporal expressions, etc. [sent-156, score-0.033]
</p><p>70 These gazetteers represent general knowledge across domains, and help to make up for the lack of training data. [sent-157, score-0.033]
</p><p>71 Given a sentence, the SRL component identifies every predicate, and for each predicate further identifies its arguments. [sent-159, score-0.154]
</p><p>72 This task has been extensively studied on well-written corpora like news, and a couple of solutions exist. [sent-160, score-0.025]

</p><p>76 Unsurprisingly, the performance of the state-of-the-art SRL system (MezaRuiz and Riedel, 2009) drops sharply when applied to tweets. [sent-173, score-0.03]
</p><p>77 The SRL component of QuickView is based on CRF, and uses the recently labeled tweets that are similar to the current tweet as the broader context. [sent-174, score-1.081]
</p><p>78 To prepare the initial clusters required by the SRL component as its input, we adopt the predicateargument mapping method (Liu et al. [sent-176, score-0.043]
</p><p>79 , 2010) to get some automatically labeled tweets, which (plus the manually labeled tweets) are then organized into groups using a bottom-up clustering procedure. [sent-177, score-0.093]

</p><p>83 Experimental results show that: 1) our NER component achieves an average F1 of 80. [sent-197, score-0.043]
</p><p>84 4% of the baseline, which is a CRF-based system similar to Ratinov and Roth’s (2009) but re-trained on annotated tweets; and 2) our SRL component gets an F1 of 59. [sent-199, score-0.066]

As one of the most popular micro-blogging services, Twitter attracts millions of users, producing millions of tweets daily. Shared information through this service spreads faster than would have been possible with traditional sources, however the proliferation of user-generation content poses challenges to browsing and finding valuable information. In this paper we propose a graph-theoretic model for tweet recommendation that presents users with items they may have an interest in. Our model ranks tweets and their authors simultaneously using several networks: the social network connecting the users, the network connecting the tweets, and a third network that ties the two together. Tweet and author entities are ranked following a co-ranking algorithm based on the intuition that that there is a mutually reinforcing relationship between tweets and their authors that could be reflected in the rankings. We show that this framework can be parametrized to take into account user preferences, the popularity of tweets and their authors, and diversity. Experimental evaluation on a large dataset shows that our model out- performs competitive approaches by a large margin.</p><p>3 0.34889501 <a title="167-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Joint_Inference_of_Named_Entity_Recognition_and_Normalization_for_Tweets.html">124 acl-2012-Joint Inference of Named Entity Recognition and Normalization for Tweets</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaohua Liu ; Ming Zhou ; Xiangyang Zhou ; Zhongyang Fu ; Furu Wei</p><p>Abstract: Tweets represent a critical source of fresh information, in which named entities occur frequently with rich variations. We study the problem of named entity normalization (NEN) for tweets. Two main challenges are the errors propagated from named entity recognition (NER) and the dearth of information in a single tweet. We propose a novel graphical model to simultaneously conduct NER and NEN on multiple tweets to address these challenges. Particularly, our model introduces a binary random variable for each pair of words with the same lemma across similar tweets, whose value indicates whether the two related words are mentions of the same entity. We evaluate our method on a manually annotated data set, and show that our method outperforms the baseline that handles these two tasks separately, boosting the F1 from 80.2% to 83.6% for NER, and the Accuracy from 79.4% to 82.6% for NEN, respectively.</p><p>4 0.34818071 <a title="167-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-A_System_for_Real-time_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_of_2012_U.S._Presidential_Election_Cycle.html">21 acl-2012-A System for Real-time Twitter Sentiment Analysis of 2012 U.S. Presidential Election Cycle</a></p>
<p>Author: Hao Wang ; Dogan Can ; Abe Kazemzadeh ; Francois Bar ; Shrikanth Narayanan</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a system for real-time analysis of public sentiment toward presidential candidates in the 2012 U.S. election as expressed on Twitter, a microblogging service. Twitter has become a central site where people express their opinions and views on political parties and candidates. Emerging events or news are often followed almost instantly by a burst in Twitter volume, providing a unique opportunity to gauge the relation between expressed public sentiment and electoral events. In addition, sentiment analysis can help explore how these events affect public opinion. While traditional content analysis takes days or weeks to complete, the system demonstrated here analyzes sentiment in the entire Twitter traffic about the election, delivering results instantly and continuously. It offers the public, the media, politicians and scholars a new and timely perspective on the dynamics of the electoral process and public opinion. 1</p><p>5 0.23474282 <a title="167-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Extracting_and_modeling_durations_for_habits_and_events_from_Twitter.html">91 acl-2012-Extracting and modeling durations for habits and events from Twitter</a></p>
<p>Author: Jennifer Williams ; Graham Katz</p><p>Abstract: We seek to automatically estimate typical durations for events and habits described in Twitter tweets. A corpus of more than 14 million tweets containing temporal duration information was collected. These tweets were classified as to their habituality status using a bootstrapped, decision tree.

<p>Author: Xiaohua Liu ; Furu Wei ; Ming Zhou ; QuickView Team Microsoft</p><p>Abstract: Tweets have become a comprehensive repository for real-time information. However, it is often hard for users to quickly get information they are interested in from tweets, owing to the sheer volume of tweets as well as their noisy and informal nature. We present QuickView, an NLP-based tweet search platform to tackle this issue. Specifically, it exploits a series of natural language processing technologies, such as tweet normalization, named entity recognition, semantic role labeling, sentiment analysis, tweet classification, to extract useful information, i.e., named entities, events, opinions, etc., from a large volume of tweets. Then, non-noisy tweets, together with the mined information, are indexed, on top of which two brand new scenarios are enabled, i.e., categorized browsing and advanced search, allowing users to effectively access either the tweets or fine-grained information they are interested in.</p><p>2 0.89011598 <a title="167-lsi-2" href="./acl-2012-Tweet_Recommendation_with_Graph_Co-Ranking.html">205 acl-2012-Tweet Recommendation with Graph Co-Ranking</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiaohua Liu ; Ming Zhou ; Xiangyang Zhou ; Zhongyang Fu ; Furu Wei</p><p>Abstract: Tweets represent a critical source of fresh information, in which named entities occur frequently with rich variations. We study the problem of named entity normalization (NEN) for tweets. Two main challenges are the errors propagated from named entity recognition (NER) and the dearth of information in a single tweet. We propose a novel graphical model to simultaneously conduct NER and NEN on multiple tweets to address these challenges. Particularly, our model introduces a binary random variable for each pair of words with the same lemma across similar tweets, whose value indicates whether the two related words are mentions of the same entity. We evaluate our method on a manually annotated data set, and show that our method outperforms the baseline that handles these two tasks separately, boosting the F1 from 80.2% to 83.6% for NER, and the Accuracy from 79.4% to 82.6% for NEN, respectively.</p><p>4 0.67710274 <a title="167-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-A_System_for_Real-time_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_of_2012_U.S._Presidential_Election_Cycle.html">21 acl-2012-A System for Real-time Twitter Sentiment Analysis of 2012 U.S. Presidential Election Cycle</a></p>
<p>Author: Hao Wang ; Dogan Can ; Abe Kazemzadeh ; Francois Bar ; Shrikanth Narayanan</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a system for real-time analysis of public sentiment toward presidential candidates in the 2012 U.S. election as expressed on Twitter, a microblogging service. Twitter has become a central site where people express their opinions and views on political parties and candidates. Emerging events or news are often followed almost instantly by a burst in Twitter volume, providing a unique opportunity to gauge the relation between expressed public sentiment and electoral events. In addition, sentiment analysis can help explore how these events affect public opinion. While traditional content analysis takes days or weeks to complete, the system demonstrated here analyzes sentiment in the entire Twitter traffic about the election, delivering results instantly and continuously. It offers the public, the media, politicians and scholars a new and timely perspective on the dynamics of the electoral process and public opinion. 1</p><p>5 0.65488333 <a title="167-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-Extracting_and_modeling_durations_for_habits_and_events_from_Twitter.html">91 acl-2012-Extracting and modeling durations for habits and events from Twitter</a></p>
<p>Author: Jennifer Williams ; Graham Katz</p><p>Abstract: We seek to automatically estimate typical durations for events and habits described in Twitter tweets. A corpus of more than 14 million tweets containing temporal duration information was collected. These tweets were classified as to their habituality status using a bootstrapped, decision tree. For each verb lemma, associated duration information was collected for episodic and habitual uses of the verb. Summary statistics for 483 verb lemmas and their typical habit and episode durations has been compiled and made available. This automatically generated duration information is broadly comparable to hand-annotation. 1</p><p>6 0.36570793 <a title="167-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-Self-Disclosure_and_Relationship_Strength_in_Twitter_Conversations.html">173 acl-2012-Self-Disclosure and Relationship Strength in Twitter Conversations</a></p>

<p>Author: Danilo Croce ; Alessandro Moschitti ; Roberto Basili ; Martha Palmer</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose innovative representations for automatic classification of verbs according to mainstream linguistic theories, namely VerbNet and FrameNet. First, syntactic and semantic structures capturing essential lexical and syntactic properties of verbs are defined. Then, we design advanced similarity functions between such structures, i.e., semantic tree kernel functions, for exploiting distributional and grammatical information in Support Vector Machines. The extensive empirical analysis on VerbNet class and frame detection shows that our models capture mean- ingful syntactic/semantic structures, which allows for improving the state-of-the-art.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.82741147 <a title="167-lda-4" href="./acl-2012-QuickView%3A_NLP-based_Tweet_Search.html">167 acl-2012-QuickView: NLP-based Tweet Search</a></p>

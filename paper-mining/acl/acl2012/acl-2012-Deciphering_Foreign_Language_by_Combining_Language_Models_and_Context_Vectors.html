<p>Author: Joern Wuebker ; Hermann Ney ; Richard Zens</p><p>Abstract: In this work we present two extensions to the well-known dynamic programming beam search in phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT), aiming at increased efficiency of decoding by minimizing the number of language model computations and hypothesis expansions. Our results show that language model based pre-sorting yields a small improvement in translation quality and a speedup by a factor of 2. Two look-ahead methods are shown to further increase translation speed by a factor of2 without changing the search space and a factor of 4 with the side-effect of some additional search errors. We compare our ap- proach with Moses and observe the same performance, but a substantially better trade-off between translation quality and speed. At a speed of roughly 70 words per second, Moses reaches 17.2% BLEU, whereas our approach yields 20.0% with identical models.</p><p>3 0.24200478 <a title="67-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-Maximum_Expected_BLEU_Training_of_Phrase_and_Lexicon_Translation_Models.html">141 acl-2012-Maximum Expected BLEU Training of Phrase and Lexicon Translation Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaodong He ; Li Deng</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new discriminative training method in constructing phrase and lexicon translation models. In order to reliably learn a myriad of parameters in these models, we propose an expected BLEU score-based utility function with KL regularization as the objective, and train the models on a large parallel dataset. For training, we derive growth transformations for phrase and lexicon translation probabilities to iteratively improve the objective. The proposed method, evaluated on the Europarl German-to-English dataset, leads to a 1.1 BLEU point improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline translation system. In IWSLT 201 1 Benchmark, our system using the proposed method achieves the best Chinese-to-English translation result on the task of translating TED talks.</p><p>4 0.15440305 <a title="67-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Translation_Model_Adaptation_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation_with_Monolingual_Topic_Information.html">203 acl-2012-Translation Model Adaptation for Statistical Machine Translation with Monolingual Topic Information</a></p>
<p>Author: Jinsong Su ; Hua Wu ; Haifeng Wang ; Yidong Chen ; Xiaodong Shi ; Huailin Dong ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: To adapt a translation model trained from the data in one domain to another, previous works paid more attention to the studies of parallel corpus while ignoring the in-domain monolingual corpora which can be obtained more easily. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for translation model adaptation by utilizing in-domain monolingual topic information instead of the in-domain bilingual corpora, which incorporates the topic information into translation probability estimation. Our method establishes the relationship between the out-of-domain bilingual corpus and the in-domain monolingual corpora via topic mapping and phrase-topic distribution probability estimation from in-domain monolingual corpora. Experimental result on the NIST Chinese-English translation task shows that our approach significantly outperforms the baseline system.</p><p>5 0.15434346 <a title="67-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-Machine_Translation_without_Words_through_Substring_Alignment.html">140 acl-2012-Machine Translation without Words through Substring Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Graham Neubig ; Taro Watanabe ; Shinsuke Mori ; Tatsuya Kawahara</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that accurate machine translation is possible without the concept of “words,” treating MT as a problem of transformation between character strings. We achieve this result by applying phrasal inversion transduction grammar alignment techniques to character strings to train a character-based translation model, and using this in the phrase-based MT framework. We also propose a look-ahead parsing algorithm and substring-informed prior probabilities to achieve more effective and efficient alignment. In an evaluation, we demonstrate that character-based translation can achieve results that compare to word-based systems while effectively translating unknown and uncommon words over several language pairs.</p><p>6 0.14539529 <a title="67-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-PORT%3A_a_Precision-Order-Recall_MT_Evaluation_Metric_for_Tuning.html">158 acl-2012-PORT: a Precision-Order-Recall MT Evaluation Metric for Tuning</a></p>

<p>Author: Shujie Liu ; Chi-Ho Li ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the issue for learning better translation consensus in machine translation (MT) research, and explore the search of translation consensus from similar, rather than the same, source sentences or their spans. Unlike previous work on this topic, we formulate the problem as structured labeling over a much smaller graph, and we propose a novel structured label propagation for the task. We convert such graph-based translation consensus from similar source strings into useful features both for n-best output reranking and for decoding algorithm. Experimental results show that, our method can significantly improve machine translation performance on both IWSLT and NIST data, compared with a state-ofthe-art baseline. 1</p><p>5 0.5955807 <a title="67-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-Sentence_Simplification_by_Monolingual_Machine_Translation.html">178 acl-2012-Sentence Simplification by Monolingual Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Sander Wubben ; Antal van den Bosch ; Emiel Krahmer</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we describe a method for simplifying sentences using Phrase Based Machine Translation, augmented with a re-ranking heuristic based on dissimilarity, and trained on a monolingual parallel corpus. We compare our system to a word-substitution baseline and two state-of-the-art systems, all trained and tested on paired sentences from the English part of Wikipedia and Simple Wikipedia. Human test subjects judge the output of the different systems. Analysing the judgements shows that by relatively careful phrase-based paraphrasing our model achieves similar sim- a. plification results to state-of-the-art systems, while generating better formed output. We also argue that text readability metrics such as the Flesch-Kincaid grade level should be used with caution when evaluating the output of simplification systems.</p><p>6 0.59283704 <a title="67-lsi-6" href="./acl-2012-Combining_Word-Level_and_Character-Level_Models_for_Machine_Translation_Between_Closely-Related_Languages.html">54 acl-2012-Combining Word-Level and Character-Level Models for Machine Translation Between Closely-Related Languages</a></p>

<p>Author: Meni Adler ; Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel text exploration model, which extends the scope of state-of-the-art technologies by moving from standard concept-based exploration to statement-based exploration. The proposed scheme utilizes the textual entailment relation between statements as the basis of the exploration process. A user of our system can explore the result space of a query by drilling down/up from one statement to another, according to entailment relations specified by an entailment graph and an optional concept taxonomy. As a prominent use case, we apply our exploration system and illustrate its benefit on the health-care domain. To the best of our knowledge this is the first implementation of an exploration system at the statement level that is based on the textual entailment relation. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.91703081 <a title="67-lda-3" href="./acl-2012-Deciphering_Foreign_Language_by_Combining_Language_Models_and_Context_Vectors.html">67 acl-2012-Deciphering Foreign Language by Combining Language Models and Context Vectors</a></p>

The workbench is intended for specialists and nontechnical audiences alike, and provides the ever expanding library of analytics compliant with the Unstructured Information Management Architecture, a widely adopted interoperability framework. We explore the flexibility of this framework by demonstrating workflows involving three processing components capable of performing self-contained machine learning-based tagging. The three components are responsible for the three distinct tasks of 1) generating observations or features, 2) training a statistical model based on the generated features, and 3) tagging unlabelled data with the model. The learning and tagging components are based on an implementation of conditional random fields (CRF); whereas the feature generation component is an analytic capable of extending basic token information to a comprehensive set of features. Users define the features of their choice directly from Argo’s graphical interface, without resorting to programming (a commonly used approach to feature engineering). The experimental results performed on two tagging tasks, chunking and named entity recognition, showed that a tagger with a generic set of features built in Argo is capable of competing with taskspecific solutions. 121</p><p>5 0.78944826 <a title="67-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Efficient_Tree-based_Approximation_for_Entailment_Graph_Learning.html">80 acl-2012-Efficient Tree-based Approximation for Entailment Graph Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan ; Meni Adler ; Jacob Goldberger</p><p>Abstract: Learning entailment rules is fundamental in many semantic-inference applications and has been an active field of research in recent years. In this paper we address the problem of learning transitive graphs that describe entailment rules between predicates (termed entailment graphs). We first identify that entailment graphs exhibit a “tree-like” property and are very similar to a novel type of graph termed forest-reducible graph. We utilize this property to develop an iterative efficient approximation algorithm for learning the graph edges, where each iteration takes linear time. We compare our approximation algorithm to a recently-proposed state-of-the-art exact algorithm and show that it is more efficient and scalable both theoretically and empirically, while its output quality is close to that given by the optimal solution of the exact algorithm.</p><p>6 0.7851823 <a title="67-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Word_Sense_Disambiguation_Improves_Information_Retrieval.html">217 acl-2012-Word Sense Disambiguation Improves Information Retrieval</a></p>

<p>Author: Srinivasan Janarthanam ; Oliver Lemon</p><p>Abstract: We present a data-driven approach to learn user-adaptive referring expression generation (REG) policies for spoken dialogue systems. Referring expressions can be difficult to understand in technical domains where users may not know the technical ‘jargon’ names of the domain entities. In such cases, dialogue systems must be able to model the user’s (lexical) domain knowledge and use appropriate referring expressions. We present a reinforcement learning (RL) framework in which the sys- tem learns REG policies which can adapt to unknown users online. Furthermore, unlike supervised learning methods which require a large corpus of expert adaptive behaviour to train on, we show that effective adaptive policies can be learned from a small dialogue corpus of non-adaptive human-machine interaction, by using a RL framework and a statistical user simulation. We show that in comparison to adaptive hand-coded baseline policies, the learned policy performs significantly better, with an 18.6% average increase in adaptation accuracy. The best learned policy also takes less dialogue time (average 1.07 min less) than the best hand-coded policy. This is because the learned policies can adapt online to changing evidence about the user’s domain expertise.</p><p>3 0.22551793 <a title="239-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Optimising_Information_Presentation_for_Spoken_Dialogue_Systems.html">187 acl-2010-Optimising Information Presentation for Spoken Dialogue Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Verena Rieser ; Oliver Lemon ; Xingkun Liu</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to Information Presentation (IP) in Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) using a data-driven statistical optimisation framework for content planning and attribute selection. First we collect data in a Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) experiment and use it to build a supervised model of human behaviour. This forms a baseline for measuring the performance of optimised policies, developed from this data using Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. We show that the optimised policies significantly outperform the baselines in a variety of generation scenarios: while the supervised model is able to attain up to 87.6% of the possible reward on this task, the RL policies are significantly better in 5 out of 6 scenarios, gaining up to 91.5% of the total possible reward. The RL policies perform especially well in more complex scenarios. We are also the first to show that adding predictive “lower level” features (e.g. from the NLG realiser) is important for optimising IP strategies according to user preferences. This provides new insights into the nature of the IP problem for SDS.</p><p>4 0.17933577 <a title="239-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Non-Cooperation_in_Dialogue.html">178 acl-2010-Non-Cooperation in Dialogue</a></p>

<p>Author: Ethan Selfridge ; Peter Heeman</p><p>Abstract: Current turn-taking approaches for spoken dialogue systems rely on the speaker releasing the turn before the other can take it. This reliance results in restricted interactions that can lead to inefficient dialogues. In this paper we present a model we refer to as Importance-Driven Turn-Bidding that treats turn-taking as a negotiative process. Each conversant bids for the turn based on the importance of the intended utterance, and Reinforcement Learning is used to indirectly learn this parameter. We find that Importance-Driven Turn-Bidding performs better than two current turntaking approaches in an artificial collaborative slot-filling domain. The negotiative nature of this model creates efficient dia- logues, and supports the improvement of mixed-initiative interaction.</p><p>6 0.16186768 <a title="239-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Phrase-Based_Statistical_Language_Generation_Using_Graphical_Models_and_Active_Learning.html">194 acl-2010-Phrase-Based Statistical Language Generation Using Graphical Models and Active Learning</a></p>

Resumption Strategies for an In-Vehicle Dialogue System</a></p>
<p>Author: Jessica Villing</p><p>Abstract: In-vehicle dialogue systems often contain more than one application, e.g. a navigation and a telephone application. This means that the user might, for example, interrupt the interaction with the telephone application to ask for directions from the navigation application, and then resume the dialogue with the telephone application. In this paper we present an analysis of interruption and resumption behaviour in human-human in-vehicle dialogues and also propose some implications for resumption strategies in an in-vehicle dialogue system.</p><p>6 0.75104374 <a title="239-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Talking_NPCs_in_a_Virtual_Game_World.html">224 acl-2010-Talking NPCs in a Virtual Game World</a></p>

<p>Author: Klinton Bicknell ; Roger Levy</p><p>Abstract: A number of results in the study of realtime sentence comprehension have been explained by computational models as resulting from the rational use of probabilistic linguistic information. Many times, these hypotheses have been tested in reading by linking predictions about relative word difficulty to word-aggregated eye tracking measures such as go-past time. In this paper, we extend these results by asking to what extent reading is well-modeled as rational behavior at a finer level of analysis, predicting not aggregate measures, but the duration and location of each fixation. We present a new rational model of eye movement control in reading, the central assumption of which is that eye move- ment decisions are made to obtain noisy visual information as the reader performs Bayesian inference on the identities of the words in the sentence. As a case study, we present two simulations demonstrating that the model gives a rational explanation for between-word regressions.</p><p>4 0.70398575 <a title="239-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Reading_between_the_Lines%3A_Learning_to_Map_High-Level_Instructions_to_Commands.html">202 acl-2010-Reading between the Lines: Learning to Map High-Level Instructions to Commands</a></p>
<p>Author: S.R.K. Branavan ; Luke Zettlemoyer ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the task of mapping high-level instructions to sequences of commands in an external environment. Processing these instructions is challenging—they posit goals to be achieved without specifying the steps required to complete them. We describe a method that fills in missing information using an automatically derived environment model that encodes states, transitions, and commands that cause these transitions to happen. We present an efficient approximate approach for learning this environment model as part of a policygradient reinforcement learning algorithm for text interpretation. This design enables learning for mapping high-level instructions, which previous statistical methods cannot handle.1</p><p>5 0.7029658 <a title="239-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Optimising_Information_Presentation_for_Spoken_Dialogue_Systems.html">187 acl-2010-Optimising Information Presentation for Spoken Dialogue Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Verena Rieser ; Oliver Lemon ; Xingkun Liu</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to Information Presentation (IP) in Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) using a data-driven statistical optimisation framework for content planning and attribute selection. First we collect data in a Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) experiment and use it to build a supervised model of human behaviour. This forms a baseline for measuring the performance of optimised policies, developed from this data using Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. We show that the optimised policies significantly outperform the baselines in a variety of generation scenarios: while the supervised model is able to attain up to 87.6% of the possible reward on this task, the RL policies are significantly better in 5 out of 6 scenarios, gaining up to 91.5% of the total possible reward. The RL policies perform especially well in more complex scenarios. We are also the first to show that adding predictive “lower level” features (e.g. from the NLG realiser) is important for optimising IP strategies according to user preferences. This provides new insights into the nature of the IP problem for SDS.</p><p>6 0.70149589 <a title="239-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Semantic_Parsing%3A_The_Task%2C_the_State_of_the_Art_and_the_Future.html">206 acl-2010-Semantic Parsing: The Task, the State of the Art and the Future</a></p>

<p>Author: Carlos Gomez-Rodriguez ; Joakim Nivre</p><p>Abstract: Finding a class of structures that is rich enough for adequate linguistic representation yet restricted enough for efficient computational processing is an important problem for dependency parsing. In this paper, we present a transition system for 2-planar dependency trees trees that can be decomposed into at most two planar graphs and show that it can be used to implement a classifier-based parser that runs in linear time and outperforms a stateof-the-art transition-based parser on four data sets from the CoNLL-X shared task. In addition, we present an efficient method – – for determining whether an arbitrary tree is 2-planar and show that 99% or more of the trees in existing treebanks are 2-planar.</p><p>3 0.14094368 <a title="27-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Distributional_Similarity_vs._PU_Learning_for_Entity_Set_Expansion.html">89 acl-2010-Distributional Similarity vs. PU Learning for Entity Set Expansion</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiao-Li Li ; Lei Zhang ; Bing Liu ; See-Kiong Ng</p><p>Abstract: Distributional similarity is a classic technique for entity set expansion, where the system is given a set of seed entities of a particular class, and is asked to expand the set using a corpus to obtain more entities of the same class as represented by the seeds. This paper shows that a machine learning model called positive and unlabeled learning (PU learning) can model the set expansion problem better. Based on the test results of 10 corpora, we show that a PU learning technique outperformed distributional similarity significantly. 1</p><p>4 0.12181138 <a title="27-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Tree-Based_Deterministic_Dependency_Parsing_-_An_Application_to_Nivre%27s_Method_-.html">242 acl-2010-Tree-Based Deterministic Dependency Parsing - An Application to Nivre's Method -</a></p>
<p>Author: Kotaro Kitagawa ; Kumiko Tanaka-Ishii</p><p>Abstract: Nivre’s method was improved by enhancing deterministic dependency parsing through application of a tree-based model. The model considers all words necessary for selection of parsing actions by including words in the form of trees. It chooses the most probable head candidate from among the trees and uses this candidate to select a parsing action. In an evaluation experiment using the Penn Treebank (WSJ section), the proposed model achieved higher accuracy than did previous deterministic models. Although the proposed model’s worst-case time complexity is O(n2), the experimental results demonstrated an average pars- ing time not much slower than O(n).</p><p>5 0.12042427 <a title="27-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-BabelNet%3A_Building_a_Very_Large_Multilingual_Semantic_Network.html">44 acl-2010-BabelNet: Building a Very Large Multilingual Semantic Network</a></p>

<p>Author: Verena Henrich ; Erhard Hinrichs</p><p>Abstract: GernEdiT (short for: GermaNet Editing Tool) offers a graphical interface for the lexicographers and developers of GermaNet to access and modify the underlying GermaNet resource. GermaNet is a lexical-semantic wordnet that is modeled after the Princeton WordNet for English. The traditional lexicographic development of GermaNet was error prone and time-consuming, mainly due to a complex underlying data format and no opportunity of automatic consistency checks. GernEdiT replaces the earlier development by a more userfriendly tool, which facilitates automatic checking of internal consistency and correctness of the linguistic resource. This paper pre- sents all these core functionalities of GernEdiT along with details about its usage and usability. 1</p><p>3 0.62995076 <a title="27-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-Identifying_Text_Polarity_Using_Random_Walks.html">141 acl-2010-Identifying Text Polarity Using Random Walks</a></p>
<p>Author: Ahmed Hassan ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: Automatically identifying the polarity of words is a very important task in Natural Language Processing. It has applications in text classification, text filtering, analysis of product review, analysis of responses to surveys, and mining online discussions. We propose a method for identifying the polarity of words. We apply a Markov random walk model to a large word relatedness graph, producing a polarity estimate for any given word. A key advantage of the model is its ability to accurately and quickly assign a polarity sign and magnitude to any word. The method could be used both in a semi-supervised setting where a training set of labeled words is used, and in an unsupervised setting where a handful of seeds is used to define the two polarity classes. The method is experimentally tested using a manually labeled set of positive and negative words. It outperforms the state of the art methods in the semi-supervised setting. The results in the unsupervised setting is comparable to the best reported values. However, the proposed method is faster and does not need a large corpus.</p><p>4 0.60664225 <a title="27-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-A_Bayesian_Method_for_Robust_Estimation_of_Distributional_Similarities.html">3 acl-2010-A Bayesian Method for Robust Estimation of Distributional Similarities</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun'ichi Kazama ; Stijn De Saeger ; Kow Kuroda ; Masaki Murata ; Kentaro Torisawa</p><p>Abstract: Existing word similarity measures are not robust to data sparseness since they rely only on the point estimation of words’ context profiles obtained from a limited amount of data. This paper proposes a Bayesian method for robust distributional word similarities. The method uses a distribution of context profiles obtained by Bayesian estimation and takes the expectation of a base similarity measure under that distribution. When the context profiles are multinomial distributions, the priors are Dirichlet, and the base measure is . the Bhattacharyya coefficient, we can derive an analytical form that allows efficient calculation. For the task of word similarity estimation using a large amount of Web data in Japanese, we show that the proposed measure gives better accuracies than other well-known similarity measures.</p><p>5 0.55084473 <a title="27-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Don%27t_%27Have_a_Clue%27%3F_Unsupervised_Co-Learning_of_Downward-Entailing_Operators..html">92 acl-2010-Don't 'Have a Clue'?

<p>Author: Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil ; Lillian Lee</p><p>Abstract: Researchers in textual entailment have begun to consider inferences involving downward-entailing operators, an interesting and important class of lexical items that change the way inferences are made. Recent work proposed a method for learning English downward-entailing operators that requires access to a high-quality collection of negative polarity items (NPIs). However, English is one of the very few languages for which such a list exists. We propose the first approach that can be applied to the many languages for which there is no pre-existing high-precision database of NPIs. As a case study, we apply our method to Romanian and show that our method yields good results. Also, we perform a cross-linguistic analysis that suggests interesting connections to some findings in linguistic typology.</p><p>6 0.53887755 <a title="27-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Distributional_Similarity_vs._PU_Learning_for_Entity_Set_Expansion.html">89 acl-2010-Distributional Similarity vs. PU Learning for Entity Set Expansion</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhi Zhong ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: Word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems based on supervised learning achieved the best performance in SensEval and SemEval workshops. However, there are few publicly available open source WSD systems. This limits the use of WSD in other applications, especially for researchers whose research interests are not in WSD. In this paper, we present IMS, a supervised English all-words WSD system. The flexible framework of IMS allows users to integrate different preprocessing tools, additional features, and different classifiers. By default, we use linear support vector machines as the classifier with multiple knowledge-based features. In our implementation, IMS achieves state-of-the-art results on several SensEval and SemEval tasks.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.96081489 <a title="27-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-An_Active_Learning_Approach_to_Finding_Related_Terms.html">27 acl-2010-An Active Learning Approach to Finding Related Terms</a></p>

In the second stage, on-topic sentences containing evaluations about the topic are further investigated at the expression level for pinpointing the properties (semantic orientation, intensity), and the functional components of the evaluations (opinion terms, targets and holders).

<p>Author: Nancy Ide ; Collin Baker ; Christiane Fellbaum ; Rebecca Passonneau</p><p>Abstract: The Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC) project provides data and annotations to serve as the base for a communitywide annotation effort of a subset of the American National Corpus. The MASC infrastructure enables the incorporation of contributed annotations into a single, usable format that can then be analyzed as it is or ported to any of a variety of other formats. MASC includes data from a much wider variety of genres than existing multiply-annotated corpora of English, and the project is committed to a fully open model of distribution, without restriction, for all data and annotations produced or contributed. As such, MASC is the first large-scale, open, communitybased effort to create much needed language resources for NLP. This paper describes the MASC project, its corpus and annotations, and serves as a call for contributions of data and annotations from the language processing community.</p><p>6 0.79282385 <a title="27-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Combining_Orthogonal_Monolingual_and_Multilingual_Sources_of_Evidence_for_All_Words_WSD.html">62 acl-2010-Combining Orthogonal Monolingual and Multilingual Sources of Evidence for All Words WSD</a></p>

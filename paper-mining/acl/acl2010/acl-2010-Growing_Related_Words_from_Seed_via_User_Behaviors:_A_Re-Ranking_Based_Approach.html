<p>Author: Xiao-Li Li ; Lei Zhang ; Bing Liu ; See-Kiong Ng</p><p>Abstract: Distributional similarity is a classic technique for entity set expansion, where the system is given a set of seed entities of a particular class, and is asked to expand the set using a corpus to obtain more entities of the same class as represented by the seeds. This paper shows that a machine learning model called positive and unlabeled learning (PU learning) can model the set expansion problem better. Based on the test results of 10 corpora, we show that a PU learning technique outperformed distributional similarity significantly. 1</p><p>3 0.11319793 <a title="129-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-A_Unified_Graph_Model_for_Sentence-Based_Opinion_Retrieval.html">22 acl-2010-A Unified Graph Model for Sentence-Based Opinion Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Binyang Li ; Lanjun Zhou ; Shi Feng ; Kam-Fai Wong</p><p>Abstract: There is a growing research interest in opinion retrieval as on-line users’ opinions are becoming more and more popular in business, social networks, etc. Practically speaking, the goal of opinion retrieval is to retrieve documents, which entail opinions or comments, relevant to a target subject specified by the user’s query. A fundamental challenge in opinion retrieval is information representation. Existing research focuses on document-based approaches and documents are represented by bag-of-word. However, due to loss of contextual information, this representation fails to capture the associative information between an opinion and its corresponding target. It cannot distinguish different degrees of a sentiment word when associated with different targets. This in turn seriously affects opinion retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a sentence-based approach based on a new information representa- , tion, namely topic-sentiment word pair, to capture intra-sentence contextual information between an opinion and its target. Additionally, we consider inter-sentence information to capture the relationships among the opinions on the same topic. Finally, the two types of information are combined in a unified graph-based model, which can effectively rank the documents. Compared with existing approaches, experimental results on the COAE08 dataset showed that our graph-based model achieved significant improvement. 1</p><p>4 0.10722371 <a title="129-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Extraction_and_Approximation_of_Numerical_Attributes_from_the_Web.html">113 acl-2010-Extraction and Approximation of Numerical Attributes from the Web</a></p>
<p>Author: Dmitry Davidov ; Ari Rappoport</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel framework for automated extraction and approximation of numerical object attributes such as height and weight from the Web. Given an object-attribute pair, we discover and analyze attribute information for a set of comparable objects in order to infer the desired value. This allows us to approximate the desired numerical values even when no exact values can be found in the text. Our framework makes use of relation defining patterns and WordNet similarity information. First, we obtain from the Web and WordNet a list of terms similar to the given object. Then we retrieve attribute values for each term in this list, and information that allows us to compare different objects in the list and to infer the attribute value range. Finally, we combine the retrieved data for all terms from the list to select or approximate the requested value. We evaluate our method using automated question answering, WordNet enrichment, and comparison with answers given in Wikipedia and by leading search engines. In all of these, our framework provides a significant improvement.</p><p>5 0.10584509 <a title="129-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Modeling_Semantic_Relevance_for_Question-Answer_Pairs_in_Web_Social_Communities.html">174 acl-2010-Modeling Semantic Relevance for Question-Answer Pairs in Web Social Communities</a></p>
<p>Author: Baoxun Wang ; Xiaolong Wang ; Chengjie Sun ; Bingquan Liu ; Lin Sun</p><p>Abstract: Quantifying the semantic relevance between questions and their candidate answers is essential to answer detection in social media corpora. In this paper, a deep belief network is proposed to model the semantic relevance for question-answer pairs. Observing the textual similarity between the community-driven questionanswering (cQA) dataset and the forum dataset, we present a novel learning strategy to promote the performance of our method on the social community datasets without hand-annotating work. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the traditional approaches on both the cQA and the forum corpora.</p><p>6 0.10201117 <a title="129-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Bootstrapping_Semantic_Analyzers_from_Non-Contradictory_Texts.html">55 acl-2010-Bootstrapping Semantic Analyzers from Non-Contradictory Texts</a></p>

<p>Author: Tingxu Yan ; Tamsin Maxwell ; Dawei Song ; Yuexian Hou ; Peng Zhang</p><p>Abstract: p . zhang1 @ rgu .ac .uk Bag-of-words approaches to information retrieval (IR) are effective but assume independence between words. The Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) is a cognitively motivated and validated semantic space model that captures statistical dependencies between words by considering their co-occurrences in a surrounding window of text. HAL has been successfully applied to query expansion in IR, but has several limitations, including high processing cost and use of distributional statistics that do not exploit syntax. In this paper, we pursue two methods for incorporating syntactic-semantic information from textual ‘events’ into HAL. We build the HAL space directly from events to investigate whether processing costs can be reduced through more careful definition of word co-occurrence, and improve the quality of the pseudo-relevance feedback by applying event information as a constraint during HAL construction. Both methods significantly improve performance results in comparison with original HAL, and interpolation of HAL and relevance model expansion outperforms either method alone.</p><p>4 0.53054267 <a title="129-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-An_Active_Learning_Approach_to_Finding_Related_Terms.html">27 acl-2010-An Active Learning Approach to Finding Related Terms</a></p>
<p>Author: David Vickrey ; Oscar Kipersztok ; Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel system that helps nonexperts find sets of similar words. The user begins by specifying one or more seed words. The system then iteratively suggests a series of candidate words, which the user can either accept or reject. Current techniques for this task typically bootstrap a classifier based on a fixed seed set. In contrast, our system involves the user throughout the labeling process, using active learning to intelligently explore the space of similar words. In particular, our system can take advantage of negative examples provided by the user. Our system combines multiple preexisting sources of similarity data (a standard thesaurus, WordNet, contextual similarity), enabling it to capture many types of similarity groups (“synonyms of crash,” “types of car,” etc.). We evaluate on a hand-labeled evaluation set; our system improves over a strong baseline by 36%.</p><p>5 0.51995724 <a title="129-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Bootstrapping_Semantic_Analyzers_from_Non-Contradictory_Texts.html">55 acl-2010-Bootstrapping Semantic Analyzers from Non-Contradictory Texts</a></p>
<p>Author: Ivan Titov ; Mikhail Kozhevnikov</p><p>Abstract: We argue that groups of unannotated texts with overlapping and non-contradictory semantics represent a valuable source of information for learning semantic representations. A simple and efficient inference method recursively induces joint semantic representations for each group and discovers correspondence between lexical entries and latent semantic concepts. We consider the generative semantics-text correspondence model (Liang et al., 2009) and demonstrate that exploiting the noncontradiction relation between texts leads to substantial improvements over natural baselines on a problem of analyzing human-written weather forecasts.</p><p>6 0.5123862 <a title="129-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Cross-Lingual_Latent_Topic_Extraction.html">79 acl-2010-Cross-Lingual Latent Topic Extraction</a></p>

<p>Author: Fei Huang ; Alexander Yates</p><p>Abstract: Most supervised language processing systems show a significant drop-off in performance when they are tested on text that comes from a domain significantly different from the domain of the training data. Semantic role labeling techniques are typically trained on newswire text, and in tests their performance on fiction is as much as 19% worse than their performance on newswire text. We investigate techniques for building open-domain semantic role labeling systems that approach the ideal of a train-once, use-anywhere system. We leverage recently-developed techniques for learning representations of text using latent-variable language models, and extend these techniques to ones that provide the kinds of features that are useful for semantic role labeling. In experiments, our novel system reduces error by 16% relative to the previous state of the art on out-of-domain text.</p><p>6 0.61915314 <a title="129-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Bootstrapping_Semantic_Analyzers_from_Non-Contradictory_Texts.html">55 acl-2010-Bootstrapping Semantic Analyzers from Non-Contradictory Texts</a></p>

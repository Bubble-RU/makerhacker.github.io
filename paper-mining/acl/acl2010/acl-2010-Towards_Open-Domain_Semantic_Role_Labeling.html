<p>Author: Fei Huang ; Alexander Yates</p><p>Abstract: Most supervised language processing systems show a significant drop-off in performance when they are tested on text that comes from a domain significantly different from the domain of the training data. Semantic role labeling techniques are typically trained on newswire text, and in tests their performance on fiction is as much as 19% worse than their performance on newswire text. We investigate techniques for building open-domain semantic role labeling systems that approach the ideal of a train-once, use-anywhere system. We leverage recently-developed techniques for learning representations of text using latent-variable language models, and extend these techniques to ones that provide the kinds of features that are useful for semantic role labeling. In experiments, our novel system reduces error by 16% relative to the previous state of the art on out-of-domain text.</p><p>3 0.27220824 <a title="238-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Joint_Syntactic_and_Semantic_Parsing_of_Chinese.html">153 acl-2010-Joint Syntactic and Semantic Parsing of Chinese</a></p>
<p>Author: Junhui Li ; Guodong Zhou ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: This paper explores joint syntactic and semantic parsing of Chinese to further improve the performance of both syntactic and semantic parsing, in particular the performance of semantic parsing (in this paper, semantic role labeling). This is done from two levels. Firstly, an integrated parsing approach is proposed to integrate semantic parsing into the syntactic parsing process. Secondly, semantic information generated by semantic parsing is incorporated into the syntactic parsing model to better capture semantic information in syntactic parsing. Evaluation on Chinese TreeBank, Chinese PropBank, and Chinese NomBank shows that our integrated parsing approach outperforms the pipeline parsing approach on n-best parse trees, a natural extension of the widely used pipeline parsing approach on the top-best parse tree. Moreover, it shows that incorporating semantic role-related information into the syntactic parsing model significantly improves the performance of both syntactic parsing and semantic parsing. To our best knowledge, this is the first research on exploring syntactic parsing and semantic role labeling for both verbal and nominal predicates in an integrated way. 1</p><p>4 0.23808433 <a title="238-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Adapting_Self-Training_for_Semantic_Role_Labeling.html">25 acl-2010-Adapting Self-Training for Semantic Role Labeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Rasoul Samad Zadeh Kaljahi</p><p>Abstract: Supervised semantic role labeling (SRL) systems trained on hand-crafted annotated corpora have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, creating such corpora is tedious and costly, with the resulting corpora not sufficiently representative of the language. This paper describes a part of an ongoing work on applying bootstrapping methods to SRL to deal with this problem. Previous work shows that, due to the complexity of SRL, this task is not straight forward. One major difficulty is the propagation of classification noise into the successive iterations. We address this problem by employing balancing and preselection methods for self-training, as a bootstrapping algorithm. The proposed methods could achieve improvement over the base line, which do not use these methods. 1</p><p>5 0.21391283 <a title="238-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Starting_from_Scratch_in_Semantic_Role_Labeling.html">216 acl-2010-Starting from Scratch in Semantic Role Labeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Connor ; Yael Gertner ; Cynthia Fisher ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: A fundamental step in sentence comprehension involves assigning semantic roles to sentence constituents. To accomplish this, the listener must parse the sentence, find constituents that are candidate arguments, and assign semantic roles to those constituents. Each step depends on prior lexical and syntactic knowledge. Where do children learning their first languages begin in solving this problem? In this paper we focus on the parsing and argumentidentification steps that precede Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) training. We combine a simplified SRL with an unsupervised HMM part of speech tagger, and experiment with psycholinguisticallymotivated ways to label clusters resulting from the HMM so that they can be used to parse input for the SRL system. The results show that proposed shallow representations of sentence structure are robust to reductions in parsing accuracy, and that the contribution of alternative representations of sentence structure to successful semantic role labeling varies with the integrity of the parsing and argumentidentification stages.</p><p>6 0.20550749 <a title="238-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Fully_Unsupervised_Core-Adjunct_Argument_Classification.html">120 acl-2010-Fully Unsupervised Core-Adjunct Argument Classification</a></p>

The task of distinguishing between the two has strong relations to various basic NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing, semantic role labeling and subcategorization acquisition. This paper presents a novel unsupervised algorithm for the task that uses no supervised models, utilizing instead state-of-the-art syntactic induction algorithms.

<p>Author: Jessica Villing</p><p>Abstract: In-vehicle dialogue systems often contain more than one application, e.g. a navigation and a telephone application. This means that the user might, for example, interrupt the interaction with the telephone application to ask for directions from the navigation application, and then resume the dialogue with the telephone application. In this paper we present an analysis of interruption and resumption behaviour in human-human in-vehicle dialogues and also propose some implications for resumption strategies in an in-vehicle dialogue system.</p><p>2 0.85380948 <a title="238-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-GernEdiT_-_The_GermaNet_Editing_Tool.html">126 acl-2010-GernEdiT - The GermaNet Editing Tool</a></p>
<p>Author: Verena Henrich ; Erhard Hinrichs</p><p>Abstract: GernEdiT (short for: GermaNet Editing Tool) offers a graphical interface for the lexicographers and developers of GermaNet to access and modify the underlying GermaNet resource. GermaNet is a lexical-semantic wordnet that is modeled after the Princeton WordNet for English. The traditional lexicographic development of GermaNet was error prone and time-consuming, mainly due to a complex underlying data format and no opportunity of automatic consistency checks. GernEdiT replaces the earlier development by a more userfriendly tool, which facilitates automatic checking of internal consistency and correctness of the linguistic resource. This paper pre- sents all these core functionalities of GernEdiT along with details about its usage and usability. 1</p><p>3 0.84342921 <a title="238-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Paraphrase_Lattice_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">192 acl-2010-Paraphrase Lattice for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Takashi Onishi ; Masao Utiyama ; Eiichiro Sumita</p><p>Abstract: Lattice decoding in statistical machine translation (SMT) is useful in speech translation and in the translation of German because it can handle input ambiguities such as speech recognition ambiguities and German word segmentation ambiguities. We show that lattice decoding is also useful for handling input variations. Given an input sentence, we build a lattice which represents paraphrases of the input sentence. We call this a paraphrase lattice. Then, we give the paraphrase lattice as an input to the lattice decoder. The decoder selects the best path for decoding. Using these paraphrase lattices as inputs, we obtained significant gains in BLEU scores for IWSLT and Europarl datasets.</p><p>4 0.84066552 <a title="238-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Preferences_versus_Adaptation_during_Referring_Expression_Generation.html">199 acl-2010-Preferences versus Adaptation during Referring Expression Generation</a></p>

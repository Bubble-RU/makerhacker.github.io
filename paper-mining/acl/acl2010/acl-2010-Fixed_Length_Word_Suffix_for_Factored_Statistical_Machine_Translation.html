<p>Author: Marine Carpuat ; Yuval Marton ; Nizar Habash</p><p>Abstract: We study the challenges raised by Arabic verb and subject detection and reordering in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). We show that post-verbal subject (VS) constructions are hard to translate because they have highly ambiguous reordering patterns when translated to English. In addition, implementing reordering is difficult because the boundaries of VS constructions are hard to detect accurately, even with a state-of-the-art Arabic dependency parser. We therefore propose to reorder VS constructions into SV order for SMT word alignment only. This strategy significantly improves BLEU and TER scores, even on a strong large-scale baseline and despite noisy parses.</p><p>3 0.17897746 <a title="119-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Boosting-Based_System_Combination_for_Machine_Translation.html">54 acl-2010-Boosting-Based System Combination for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Xiao ; Jingbo Zhu ; Muhua Zhu ; Huizhen Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a simple and effective method to address the issue of how to generate diversified translation systems from a single Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) engine for system combination. Our method is based on the framework of boosting. First, a sequence of weak translation systems is generated from a baseline system in an iterative manner. Then, a strong translation system is built from the ensemble of these weak translation systems. To adapt boosting to SMT system combination, several key components of the original boosting algorithms are redesigned in this work. We evaluate our method on Chinese-to-English Machine Translation (MT) tasks in three baseline systems, including a phrase-based system, a hierarchical phrasebased system and a syntax-based system. The experimental results on three NIST evaluation test sets show that our method leads to significant improvements in translation accuracy over the baseline systems. 1</p><p>4 0.17833281 <a title="119-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Training_Phrase_Translation_Models_with_Leaving-One-Out.html">240 acl-2010-Training Phrase Translation Models with Leaving-One-Out</a></p>
<p>Author: Joern Wuebker ; Arne Mauser ; Hermann Ney</p><p>Abstract: Several attempts have been made to learn phrase translation probabilities for phrasebased statistical machine translation that go beyond pure counting of phrases in word-aligned training data. Most approaches report problems with overfitting. We describe a novel leavingone-out approach to prevent over-fitting that allows us to train phrase models that show improved translation performance on the WMT08 Europarl German-English task. In contrast to most previous work where phrase models were trained separately from other models used in translation, we include all components such as single word lexica and reordering mod- els in training. Using this consistent training of phrase models we are able to achieve improvements of up to 1.4 points in BLEU. As a side effect, the phrase table size is reduced by more than 80%.</p><p>5 0.17812486 <a title="119-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Syntax-to-Morphology_Mapping_in_Factored_Phrase-Based_Statistical_Machine_Translation_from_English_to_Turkish.html">221 acl-2010-Syntax-to-Morphology Mapping in Factored Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation from English to Turkish</a></p>
<p>Author: Reyyan Yeniterzi ; Kemal Oflazer</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel scheme to apply factored phrase-based SMT to a language pair with very disparate morphological structures. Our approach relies on syntactic analysis on the source side (English) and then encodes a wide variety of local and non-local syntactic structures as complex structural tags which appear as additional factors in the training data. On the target side (Turkish), we only perform morphological analysis and disambiguation but treat the complete complex morphological tag as a factor, instead of separating morphemes. We incrementally explore capturing various syntactic substructures as complex tags on the English side, and evaluate how our translations improve in BLEU scores. Our maximal set of source and target side transformations, coupled with some additional techniques, provide an 39% relative improvement from a baseline 17.08 to 23.78 BLEU, all averaged over 10 training and test sets. Now that the syntactic analysis on the English side is available, we also experiment with more long distance constituent reordering to bring the English constituent order close to Turkish, but find that these transformations do not provide any additional consistent tangible gains when averaged over the 10 sets.</p><p>6 0.16447726 <a title="119-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Unsupervised_Search_for_the_Optimal_Segmentation_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">249 acl-2010-Unsupervised Search for the Optimal Segmentation for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jinsong Su ; Yang Liu ; Yajuan Lv ; Haitao Mi ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: Lexicalized reordering models play a crucial role in phrase-based translation systems. They are usually learned from the word-aligned bilingual corpus by examining the reordering relations of adjacent phrases. Instead of just checking whether there is one phrase adjacent to a given phrase, we argue that it is important to take the number of adjacent phrases into account for better estimations of reordering models. We propose to use a structure named reordering graph, which represents all phrase segmentations of a sentence pair, to learn lexicalized reordering models efficiently. Experimental results on the NIST Chinese-English test sets show that our approach significantly outperforms the baseline method. 1</p><p>4 0.64511579 <a title="119-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Syntax-to-Morphology_Mapping_in_Factored_Phrase-Based_Statistical_Machine_Translation_from_English_to_Turkish.html">221 acl-2010-Syntax-to-Morphology Mapping in Factored Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation from English to Turkish</a></p>

<p>Author: Coskun Mermer ; Ahmet Afsin Akin</p><p>Abstract: We tackle the previously unaddressed problem of unsupervised determination of the optimal morphological segmentation for statistical machine translation (SMT) and propose a segmentation metric that takes into account both sides of the SMT training corpus. We formulate the objective function as the posterior probability of the training corpus according to a generative segmentation-translation model. We describe how the IBM Model-1 translation likelihood can be computed incrementally between adjacent segmentation states for efficient computation. Submerging the proposed segmentation method in a SMT task from morphologically-rich Turkish to English does not exhibit the expected improvement in translation BLEU scores and confirms the robustness of phrase-based SMT to translation unit combinatorics. A positive outcome of this work is the described modification to the sequential search algorithm of Morfessor (Creutz and Lagus, 2007) that enables arbitrary-fold parallelization of the computation, which unexpectedly improves the translation performance as measured by BLEU.</p><p>6 0.59834868 <a title="119-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Boosting-Based_System_Combination_for_Machine_Translation.html">54 acl-2010-Boosting-Based System Combination for Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Wei Wei ; Jon Atle Gulla</p><p>Abstract: Existing works on sentiment analysis on product reviews suffer from the following limitations: (1) The knowledge of hierarchical relationships of products attributes is not fully utilized. (2) Reviews or sentences mentioning several attributes associated with complicated sentiments are not dealt with very well. In this paper, we propose a novel HL-SOT approach to labeling a product’s attributes and their associated sentiments in product reviews by a Hierarchical Learning (HL) process with a defined Sentiment Ontology Tree (SOT). The empirical analysis against a humanlabeled data set demonstrates promising and reasonable performance of the proposed HL-SOT approach. While this paper is mainly on sentiment analysis on reviews of one product, our proposed HLSOT approach is easily generalized to labeling a mix of reviews of more than one products.</p><p>3 0.67054206 <a title="119-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-SVD_and_Clustering_for_Unsupervised_POS_Tagging.html">205 acl-2010-SVD and Clustering for Unsupervised POS Tagging</a></p>

It can also produce a range of finer-grained taggings, with potential applications to various tasks. 1</p><p>4 0.6674583 <a title="119-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Hierarchical_Search_for_Word_Alignment.html">133 acl-2010-Hierarchical Search for Word Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Riesa ; Daniel Marcu</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple yet powerful hierarchical search algorithm for automatic word alignment. Our algorithm induces a forest of alignments from which we can efficiently extract a ranked k-best list. We score a given alignment within the forest with a flexible, linear discriminative model incorporating hundreds of features, and trained on a relatively small amount of annotated data. We report results on Arabic-English word alignment and translation tasks. Our model outperforms a GIZA++ Model-4 baseline by 6.3 points in F-measure, yielding a 1.1 BLEU score increase over a state-of-the-art syntax-based machine translation system.</p><p>5 0.66657424 <a title="119-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Discriminative_Modeling_of_Extraction_Sets_for_Machine_Translation.html">87 acl-2010-Discriminative Modeling of Extraction Sets for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: John DeNero ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We present a discriminative model that directly predicts which set ofphrasal translation rules should be extracted from a sentence pair. Our model scores extraction sets: nested collections of all the overlapping phrase pairs consistent with an underlying word alignment. Extraction set models provide two principle advantages over word-factored alignment models. First, we can incorporate features on phrase pairs, in addition to word links. Second, we can optimize for an extraction-based loss function that relates directly to the end task of generating translations. Our model gives improvements in alignment quality relative to state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised baselines, as well as providing up to a 1.4 improvement in BLEU score in Chinese-to-English translation experiments.</p><p>6 0.66607177 <a title="119-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Error_Detection_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation_Using_Linguistic_Features.html">102 acl-2010-Error Detection for Statistical Machine Translation Using Linguistic Features</a></p>

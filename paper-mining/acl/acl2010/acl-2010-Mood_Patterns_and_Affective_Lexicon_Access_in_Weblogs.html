<p>Author: Keun Chan Park ; Yoonjae Jeong ; Sung Hyon Myaeng</p><p>Abstract: Weblogs are a source of human activity knowledge comprising valuable information such as facts, opinions and personal experiences. In this paper, we propose a method for mining personal experiences from a large set of weblogs. We define experience as knowledge embedded in a collection of activities or events which an individual or group has actually undergone. Based on an observation that experience-revealing sentences have a certain linguistic style, we formulate the problem of detecting experience as a classification task using various features including tense, mood, aspect, modality, experiencer, and verb classes. We also present an activity verb lexicon construction method based on theories of lexical semantics. Our results demonstrate that the activity verb lexicon plays a pivotal role among selected features in the classification perfor- , mance and shows that our proposed method outperforms the baseline significantly.</p><p>3 0.098875612 <a title="176-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Generating_Focused_Topic-Specific_Sentiment_Lexicons.html">123 acl-2010-Generating Focused Topic-Specific Sentiment Lexicons</a></p>
<p>Author: Valentin Jijkoun ; Maarten de Rijke ; Wouter Weerkamp</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for automatically generating focused and accurate topicspecific subjectivity lexicons from a general purpose polarity lexicon that allow users to pin-point subjective on-topic information in a set of relevant documents. We motivate the need for such lexicons in the field of media analysis, describe a bootstrapping method for generating a topic-specific lexicon from a general purpose polarity lexicon, and evaluate the quality of the generated lexicons both manually and using a TREC Blog track test set for opinionated blog post retrieval. Although the generated lexicons can be an order of magnitude more selective than the general purpose lexicon, they maintain, or even improve, the performance of an opin- ion retrieval system.</p><p>4 0.068542317 <a title="176-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Recommendation_in_Internet_Forums_and_Blogs.html">204 acl-2010-Recommendation in Internet Forums and Blogs</a></p>

Such a feature should be utilized while attempting to provide intelligent services to social media participants. In this article, we present a framework to recommend relevant information in Internet forums and blogs using user comments, one of the most representative of user behaviors in online discussion. When incorporating user comments, we consider structural, semantic, and authority information carried by them. One of the most important observation from this work is that semantic contents of user comments can play a fairly different role in a different form of social media. When designing a recommendation system for this purpose, such a difference must be considered with caution.</p><p>5 0.066434443 <a title="176-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Sentiment_Translation_through_Lexicon_Induction.html">210 acl-2010-Sentiment Translation through Lexicon Induction</a></p>

<p>Author: Richard Power</p><p>Abstract: We describe the strategy currently pursued for verbalising OWL ontologies by sentences in Controlled Natural Language (i.e., combining generic rules for realising logical patterns with ontology-specific lexicons for realising atomic terms for individuals, classes, and properties) and argue that its success depends on assumptions about the complexity of terms and axioms in the ontology. We then show, through analysis of a corpus of ontologies, that although these assumptions could in principle be violated, they are overwhelmingly respected in practice by ontology developers.</p><p>6 0.36693904 <a title="176-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-A_Study_of_Information_Retrieval_Weighting_Schemes_for_Sentiment_Analysis.html">18 acl-2010-A Study of Information Retrieval Weighting Schemes for Sentiment Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Nikolaos Trogkanis ; Charles Elkan</p><p>Abstract: Finding allowable places in words to insert hyphens is an important practical problem. The algorithm that is used most often nowadays has remained essentially unchanged for 25 years. This method is the TEX hyphenation algorithm of Knuth and Liang. We present here a hyphenation method that is clearly more accurate. The new method is an application of conditional random fields. We create new training sets for English and Dutch from the CELEX European lexical resource, and achieve error rates for English of less than 0.1% for correctly allowed hyphens, and less than 0.01% for Dutch. Experiments show that both the Knuth/Liang method and a leading current commercial alternative have error rates several times higher for both languages.</p><p>3 0.39577556 <a title="176-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-A_Risk_Minimization_Framework_for_Extractive_Speech_Summarization.html">14 acl-2010-A Risk Minimization Framework for Extractive Speech Summarization</a></p>
<p>Author: Shih-Hsiang Lin ; Berlin Chen</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we formulate extractive summarization as a risk minimization problem and propose a unified probabilistic framework that naturally combines supervised and unsupervised summarization models to inherit their individual merits as well as to overcome their inherent limitations. In addition, the introduction of various loss functions also provides the summarization framework with a flexible but systematic way to render the redundancy and coherence relationships among sentences and between sentences and the whole document, respectively. Experiments on speech summarization show that the methods deduced from our framework are very competitive with existing summarization approaches. 1</p><p>4 0.376311 <a title="176-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Faster_Parsing_by_Supertagger_Adaptation.html">114 acl-2010-Faster Parsing by Supertagger Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan K. Kummerfeld ; Jessika Roesner ; Tim Dawborn ; James Haggerty ; James R. Curran ; Stephen Clark</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel self-training method for a parser which uses a lexicalised grammar and supertagger, focusing on increasing the speed of the parser rather than its accuracy. The idea is to train the supertagger on large amounts of parser output, so that the supertagger can learn to supply the supertags that the parser will eventually choose as part of the highestscoring derivation. Since the supertagger supplies fewer supertags overall, the parsing speed is increased. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method using a CCG supertagger and parser, obtain- ing significant speed increases on newspaper text with no loss in accuracy. We also show that the method can be used to adapt the CCG parser to new domains, obtaining accuracy and speed improvements for Wikipedia and biomedical text.</p><p>5 0.32560965 <a title="176-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Models_of_Metaphor_in_NLP.html">175 acl-2010-Models of Metaphor in NLP</a></p>

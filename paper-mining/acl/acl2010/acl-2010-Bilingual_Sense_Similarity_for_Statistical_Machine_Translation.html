<p>Author: Zhiyang Wang ; Yajuan Lv ; Qun Liu ; Young-Sook Hwang</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel filtration criterion to restrict the rule extraction for the hierarchical phrase-based translation model, where a bilingual but relaxed wellformed dependency restriction is used to filter out bad rules. Furthermore, a new feature which describes the regularity that the source/target dependency edge triggers the target/source word is also proposed. Experimental results show that, the new criteria weeds out about 40% rules while with translation performance improvement, and the new feature brings an- other improvement to the baseline system, especially on larger corpus.</p><p>3 0.212938 <a title="51-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Boosting-Based_System_Combination_for_Machine_Translation.html">54 acl-2010-Boosting-Based System Combination for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Xiao ; Jingbo Zhu ; Muhua Zhu ; Huizhen Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a simple and effective method to address the issue of how to generate diversified translation systems from a single Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) engine for system combination. Our method is based on the framework of boosting. First, a sequence of weak translation systems is generated from a baseline system in an iterative manner. Then, a strong translation system is built from the ensemble of these weak translation systems. To adapt boosting to SMT system combination, several key components of the original boosting algorithms are redesigned in this work. We evaluate our method on Chinese-to-English Machine Translation (MT) tasks in three baseline systems, including a phrase-based system, a hierarchical phrasebased system and a syntax-based system. The experimental results on three NIST evaluation test sets show that our method leads to significant improvements in translation accuracy over the baseline systems. 1</p><p>4 0.20531644 <a title="51-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-A_Joint_Rule_Selection_Model_for_Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation.html">9 acl-2010-A Joint Rule Selection Model for Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Cui ; Dongdong Zhang ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou ; Tiejun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: In hierarchical phrase-based SMT systems, statistical models are integrated to guide the hierarchical rule selection for better translation performance. Previous work mainly focused on the selection of either the source side of a hierarchical rule or the target side of a hierarchical rule rather than considering both of them simultaneously. This paper presents a joint model to predict the selection of hierarchical rules. The proposed model is estimated based on four sub-models where the rich context knowledge from both source and target sides is leveraged. Our method can be easily incorporated into the practical SMT systems with the log-linear model framework. The experimental results show that our method can yield significant improvements in performance.</p><p>5 0.18399212 <a title="51-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Training_Phrase_Translation_Models_with_Leaving-One-Out.html">240 acl-2010-Training Phrase Translation Models with Leaving-One-Out</a></p>
<p>Author: Joern Wuebker ; Arne Mauser ; Hermann Ney</p><p>Abstract: Several attempts have been made to learn phrase translation probabilities for phrasebased statistical machine translation that go beyond pure counting of phrases in word-aligned training data. Most approaches report problems with overfitting. We describe a novel leavingone-out approach to prevent over-fitting that allows us to train phrase models that show improved translation performance on the WMT08 Europarl German-English task. In contrast to most previous work where phrase models were trained separately from other models used in translation, we include all components such as single word lexica and reordering mod- els in training. Using this consistent training of phrase models we are able to achieve improvements of up to 1.4 points in BLEU. As a side effect, the phrase table size is reduced by more than 80%.</p><p>6 0.17841016 <a title="51-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Learning_to_Translate_with_Source_and_Target_Syntax.html">169 acl-2010-Learning to Translate with Source and Target Syntax</a></p>

<p>Author: Haitao Mi ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: Tree-to-string systems (and their forestbased extensions) have gained steady popularity thanks to their simplicity and efficiency, but there is a major limitation: they are unable to guarantee the grammaticality of the output, which is explicitly modeled in string-to-tree systems via targetside syntax. We thus propose to combine the advantages of both, and present a novel constituency-to-dependency translation model, which uses constituency forests on the source side to direct the translation, and dependency trees on the target side (as a language model) to ensure grammaticality. Medium-scale experiments show an absolute and statistically significant improvement of +0.7 BLEU points over a state-of-the-art forest-based tree-to-string system even with fewer rules. This is also the first time that a treeto-tree model can surpass tree-to-string counterparts.</p><p>3 0.78920317 <a title="51-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Distributional_Similarity_vs._PU_Learning_for_Entity_Set_Expansion.html">89 acl-2010-Distributional Similarity vs. PU Learning for Entity Set Expansion</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiao-Li Li ; Lei Zhang ; Bing Liu ; See-Kiong Ng</p><p>Abstract: Distributional similarity is a classic technique for entity set expansion, where the system is given a set of seed entities of a particular class, and is asked to expand the set using a corpus to obtain more entities of the same class as represented by the seeds. This paper shows that a machine learning model called positive and unlabeled learning (PU learning) can model the set expansion problem better. Based on the test results of 10 corpora, we show that a PU learning technique outperformed distributional similarity significantly. 1</p><p>4 0.74473071 <a title="51-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Discriminative_Modeling_of_Extraction_Sets_for_Machine_Translation.html">87 acl-2010-Discriminative Modeling of Extraction Sets for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: John DeNero ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We present a discriminative model that directly predicts which set ofphrasal translation rules should be extracted from a sentence pair. Our model scores extraction sets: nested collections of all the overlapping phrase pairs consistent with an underlying word alignment. Extraction set models provide two principle advantages over word-factored alignment models. First, we can incorporate features on phrase pairs, in addition to word links. Second, we can optimize for an extraction-based loss function that relates directly to the end task of generating translations. Our model gives improvements in alignment quality relative to state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised baselines, as well as providing up to a 1.4 improvement in BLEU score in Chinese-to-English translation experiments.</p><p>5 0.74051684 <a title="51-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Pseudo-Word_for_Phrase-Based_Machine_Translation.html">201 acl-2010-Pseudo-Word for Phrase-Based Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiao Li</p><p>Abstract: Determining the semantic intent of web queries not only involves identifying their semantic class, which is a primary focus of previous works, but also understanding their semantic structure. In this work, we formally define the semantic structure of noun phrase queries as comprised of intent heads and intent modifiers. We present methods that automatically identify these constituents as well as their semantic roles based on Markov and semi-Markov conditional random fields. We show that the use of semantic features and syntactic features significantly contribute to improving the understanding performance.</p><p>3 0.16731226 <a title="164-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Speech-Driven_Access_to_the_Deep_Web_on_Mobile_Devices.html">215 acl-2010-Speech-Driven Access to the Deep Web on Mobile Devices</a></p>

<p>Author: Shane Bergsma ; Emily Pitler ; Dekang Lin</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we systematically assess the value of using web-scale N-gram data in state-of-the-art supervised NLP classifiers. We compare classifiers that include or exclude features for the counts of various N-grams, where the counts are obtained from a web-scale auxiliary corpus. We show that including N-gram count features can advance the state-of-the-art accuracy on standard data sets for adjective ordering, spelling correction, noun compound bracketing, and verb part-of-speech disambiguation. More importantly, when operating on new domains, or when labeled training data is not plentiful, we show that using web-scale N-gram features is essential for achieving robust performance.</p><p>5 0.13593407 <a title="164-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Active_Learning-Based_Elicitation_for_Semi-Supervised_Word_Alignment.html">24 acl-2010-Active Learning-Based Elicitation for Semi-Supervised Word Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Vamshi Ambati ; Stephan Vogel ; Jaime Carbonell</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised word alignment aims to improve the accuracy of automatic word alignment by incorporating full or partial manual alignments. Motivated by standard active learning query sampling frameworks like uncertainty-, margin- and query-by-committee sampling we propose multiple query strategies for the alignment link selection task. Our experiments show that by active selection of uncertain and informative links, we reduce the overall manual effort involved in elicitation of alignment link data for training a semisupervised word aligner.</p><p>6 0.13040026 <a title="164-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Multilingual_Pseudo-Relevance_Feedback%3A_Performance_Study_of_Assisting_Languages.html">177 acl-2010-Multilingual Pseudo-Relevance Feedback: Performance Study of Assisting Languages</a></p>

<p>Author: Manoj Kumar Chinnakotla ; Karthik Raman ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: In a previous work of ours Chinnakotla et al. (2010) we introduced a novel framework for Pseudo-Relevance Feedback (PRF) called MultiPRF. Given a query in one language called Source, we used English as the Assisting Language to improve the performance of PRF for the source language. MulitiPRF showed remarkable improvement over plain Model Based Feedback (MBF) uniformly for 4 languages, viz., French, German, Hungarian and Finnish with English as the assisting language. This fact inspired us to study the effect of any source-assistant pair on MultiPRF performance from out of a set of languages with widely different characteristics, viz., Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German and Spanish. Carrying this further, we looked into the effect of using two assisting languages together on PRF. The present paper is a report of these investigations, their results and conclusions drawn therefrom. While performance improvement on MultiPRF is observed whatever the assisting language and whatever the source, observations are mixed when two assisting languages are used simultaneously. Interestingly, the performance improvement is more pronounced when the source and assisting languages are closely related, e.g., French and Spanish.</p><p>3 0.77556509 <a title="164-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-Understanding_the_Semantic_Structure_of_Noun_Phrase_Queries.html">245 acl-2010-Understanding the Semantic Structure of Noun Phrase Queries</a></p>

<p>Author: Tingxu Yan ; Tamsin Maxwell ; Dawei Song ; Yuexian Hou ; Peng Zhang</p><p>Abstract: p . zhang1 @ rgu .ac .uk Bag-of-words approaches to information retrieval (IR) are effective but assume independence between words. The Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) is a cognitively motivated and validated semantic space model that captures statistical dependencies between words by considering their co-occurrences in a surrounding window of text. HAL has been successfully applied to query expansion in IR, but has several limitations, including high processing cost and use of distributional statistics that do not exploit syntax. In this paper, we pursue two methods for incorporating syntactic-semantic information from textual ‘events’ into HAL. We build the HAL space directly from events to investigate whether processing costs can be reduced through more careful definition of word co-occurrence, and improve the quality of the pseudo-relevance feedback by applying event information as a constraint during HAL construction. Both methods significantly improve performance results in comparison with original HAL, and interpolation of HAL and relevance model expansion outperforms either method alone.</p><p>5 0.59762764 <a title="164-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Speech-Driven_Access_to_the_Deep_Web_on_Mobile_Devices.html">215 acl-2010-Speech-Driven Access to the Deep Web on Mobile Devices</a></p>

<p>Author: Jonathan May ; Kevin Knight ; Heiko Vogler</p><p>Abstract: Weighted tree transducers have been proposed as useful formal models for representing syntactic natural language processing applications, but there has been little description of inference algorithms for these automata beyond formal foundations. We give a detailed description of algorithms for application of cascades of weighted tree transducers to weighted tree acceptors, connecting formal theory with actual practice. Additionally, we present novel on-the-fly variants of these algorithms, and compare their performance on a syntax machine translation cascade based on (Yamada and Knight, 2001). 1 Motivation Weighted finite-state transducers have found recent favor as models of natural language (Mohri, 1997). In order to make actual use of systems built with these formalisms we must first calculate the set of possible weighted outputs allowed by the transducer given some input, which we call forward application, or the set of possible weighted inputs given some output, which we call backward application. After application we can do some inference on this result, such as determining its k highest weighted elements. We may also want to divide up our problems into manageable chunks, each represented by a transducer. As noted by Woods (1980), it is easier for designers to write several small transducers where each performs a simple transformation, rather than painstakingly construct a single complicated device. We would like to know, then, the result of transformation of input or output by a cascade of transducers, one operating after the other. As we will see, there are various strategies for approaching this problem. We will consider offline composition, bucket brigade applica- tion, and on-the-fly application. Application of cascades of weighted string transducers (WSTs) has been well-studied (Mohri, Heiko Vogler Technische Universit a¨t Dresden Institut f u¨r Theoretische Informatik 01062 Dresden, Germany he iko .vogle r@ tu-dre s den .de 1997). Less well-studied but of more recent interest is application of cascades of weighted tree transducers (WTTs). We tackle application of WTT cascades in this work, presenting: • • • explicit algorithms for application of WTT casceaxpdelisc novel algorithms for on-the-fly application of nWoTvTe lca alscgoardieths,m mansd f experiments comparing the performance of tehxepseer iamlgeonrtisthm cos.m 2 Strategies for the string case Before we discuss application of WTTs, it is helpful to recall the solution to this problem in the WST domain. We recall previous formal presentations of WSTs (Mohri, 1997) and note informally that they may be represented as directed graphs with designated start and end states and edges labeled with input symbols, output symbols, and weights.1 Fortunately, the solution for WSTs is practically trivial—we achieve application through a series of embedding, composition, and projection operations. Embedding is simply the act of representing a string or regular string language as an identity WST. Composition of WSTs, that is, generating a single WST that captures the transformations of two input WSTs used in sequence, is not at all trivial, but has been well covered in, e.g., (Mohri, 2009), where directly implementable algorithms can be found. Finally, projection is another trivial operation—the domain or range language can be obtained from a WST by ignoring the output or input symbols, respectively, on its arcs, and summing weights on otherwise identical arcs. By embedding an input, composing the result with the given WST, and projecting the result, forward application is accomplished.2 We are then left with a weighted string acceptor (WSA), essentially a weighted, labeled graph, which can be traversed R+1∪W {e+ as∞su}m,te ha thtro thuegh woeuitgh t hi osf p aa ppaetrh t ihsa cta wlceuilgahtetds a asre th ien prod∪uct { +of∞ ∞th}e, wtheaitgh thtes wofe i gtsh etd ogfes a, panatdh t ihsat c athlceu lwateeigdh ats so tfh ae (not necessarily finite) set T of paths is calculated as the sum of the weights of the paths of T. 2For backward applications, the roles of input and output are simply exchanged. 1058 ProceedingUsp opfs thaela 4, 8Stwhe Adnennu,a 1l1- M16ee Jtiunlgy o 2f0 t1h0e.

Because WSTs can be freely composed, extending application to operate on a cascade of WSTs is fairly trivial. The only question is one of composition order: whether to initially compose the cascade into a single transducer (an approach we call offline composition) or to compose the initial embedding with the first transducer, trim useless states, compose the result with the second, and so on (an approach we call bucket brigade). The appropriate strategy generally depends on the structure of the individual transducers. A third approach builds the result incrementally, as dictated by some algorithm that requests information about it. Such an approach, which we call on-the-fly, was described in (Pereira and Riley, 1997; Mohri, 2009; Mohri et al., 2000). If we can efficiently calculate the outgoing edges of a state of the result WSA on demand, without calculating all edges in the entire machine, we can maintain a stand-in for the result structure, a machine consisting at first of only the start state of the true result. As a calling algorithm (e.g., an implementation of Dijkstra’s algorithm) requests information about the result graph, such as the set of outgoing edges from a state, we replace the current stand-in with a richer version by adding the result of the request. The on-the-fly approach has a distinct advantage over the other two methods in that the entire result graph need not be built. A graphical representation of all three methods is presented in Figure 1. 3 AppCliEcdcF//a..53ti64on of treeB tFranscd/d./3.u264cers Now let us revisit these strategies in the setting of trees and tree transducers. Imagine we have a tree or set of trees as input that can be represented as a weighted regular tree grammar3 (WRTG) and a WTT that can transform that input with some weight. We would like to know the k-best trees the WTT can produce as output for that input, along with their weights. We already know of several methods for acquiring k-best trees from a WRTG (Huang and Chiang, 2005; Pauls and Klein, 2009), so we then must ask if, analogously to the string case, WTTs preserve recognizability4 and we can form an application WRTG. Before we begin, however, we must define WTTs and WRTGs. 3.1 Preliminaries5 A ranked alphabet is a finite set Σ such that every member σ ∈ Σ has a rank rk(σ) ∈ N.

Table 1 presents known results for the top-down tree transducer classes described in Section 3. 1. Unlike the string case, preservation of recognizability is not universal or symmetric. This is important for us, because we can only construct an application WRTG, i.e., a WRTG representing the result of application, if we can ensure that the language generated by application is in fact recognizable. Of the types under consideration, only wxLNT and wLNT preserve forward recognizability. The two classes marked as open questions and the other classes, which are superclasses of wNT, do not or are presumed not to. All subclasses of wxLT preserve backward recognizability.7 We do not consider cases where recognizability is not preserved tshuamt in the remainder of this paper. If a transducer M of a class that preserves forward recognizability is applied to a WRTG G, we can call the forward ap7Note that the introduction of weights limits recognizability preservation considerably. For example, (unweighted) xT preserves backward recognizability. plication WRTG M(G). and if M preserves backward recognizability, we can call the backward application WRTG M(G)/. Now that we have explained the application problem in the context of weighted tree transducers and determined the classes for which application is possible, let us consider how to build forward and backward application WRTGs. Our basic approach mimics that taken for WSTs by using an embed-compose-project strategy. As in string world, if we can embed the input in a transducer, compose with the given transducer, and project the result, we can obtain the application WRTG. Embedding a WRTG in a wLNT is a trivial operation—if the WRTG is in normal form and chain production-free,8 for every production of the form n − →w σ(n1 , . . . , nk), create a rule ofthe form n.σ(x1 , . . . , xk) − →w σ(n1 .x1, . . . , nk.xk). Range × projection of a w− x→LN σT(n is also trivial—for every q ∈ Q and u ∈ T∆ (Q X) create a production of the form q ∈−→w T u(0 where )u 0c is formed from u by replacing al−l → →lea uves of the form q.x with the leaf q, i.e., removing references to variables, and w is the sum of the weights of all rules of the form q.y → u in R.9 Domain projection for wxLT is bq.eyst →exp ulai inne dR b.y way of example. The left side of a rule is preserved, with variables leaves replaced by their associated states from the right side. So, the rule q1.σ(γ(x1) , x2) − →w δ(q2.x2, β(α, q3.x1)) would yield the production q1 q− →w σ(γ(q3) , q2) in the domain projection. Howev− →er, aσ dγe(lqeting rule such as q1.σ(x1 , x2) − →w γ(q2.x2) necessitates the introduction of a new →non γte(rqminal ⊥ that can genienrtartoed aullc toiof nT Σo fw ai nthe wwe niognhtte r1m . The only missing piece in our embed-composeproject strategy is composition. Algorithm 1, which is based on the declarative construction of Maletti (2006), generates the syntactic composition of a wxLT and a wLNT, a generalization of the basic composition construction of Baker (1979). It calls Algorithm 2, which determines the sequences of rules in the second transducer that match the right side of a single rule in the × first transducer. Since the embedded WRTG is of type wLNT, it may be either the first or second argument provided to Algorithm 1, depending on whether the application is forward or backward. We can thus use the embed-compose-project strategy for forward application of wLNT and backward application of wxLT and wxLNT. Note that we cannot use this strategy for forward applica8Without loss of generality we assume this is so, since standard algorithms exist to remove chain productions (Kuich, 1998; E´sik and Kuich, 2003; Mohri, 2009) and convert into normal form (Alexandrakis and Bozapalidis, 1987). 9Finitely many such productions may be formed. 1061 tion of wxLNT, even though that class preserves recognizability.

We will revisit the three strategies for accomplishing application discussed above for the string case. In order for offline composition to be a viable strategy, the transducers in the cascade must be closed under composition. Unfortunately, of the classes that preserve recognizability, only wLNT × is closed under composition (G´ ecseg and Steinby, 1984; Baker, 1979; Maletti et al., 2009; F ¨ul ¨op and Vogler, 2009). However, the general lack of composability of tree transducers does not preclude us from conducting forward application of a cascade. We revisit the bucket brigade approach, which in Section 2 appeared to be little more than a choice of composition order. As discussed previously, application of a single transducer involves an embedding, a composition, and a projection. The embedded WRTG is in the class wLNT, and the projection forms another WRTG. As long as every transducer in the cascade can be composed with a wLNT to its left or right, depending on the application type, application of a cascade is possible. Note that this embed-compose-project process is somewhat more burdensome than in the string case. For strings, application is obtained by a single embedding, a series of compositions, and a single projecAlgorithm 2 COVER 1: inputs 2: u ∈ T∆ (Q1 X) 3: wuT ∈ M T2 = (Q×2, X X∆), Γ, R2, q20 ) 4: state q2 ∈ Q2 ×× × 5: outputs 6: set of pairs (z, w) with z ∈ TΓ ((Q1 Q2) X) fsoetrm ofed p ab yir so (nze, ,o wr m) worieth hsu zcc ∈es Tsful runs× ×on Q Qu )b y × ×ru Xles) in R2, starting from q2, and w ∈ R+∞ the sum of the weights of all such runs,. 7: complexity 8: O(|R2|size(u)) 9: 10: 11: 12: 13: 14: if u(ε) is of the form (q1,x) ∈ Q1× X then zinit ← ((q1 q2), x) else zinit ← ⊥ Πlast ←← ←{(z ⊥init, {((ε, ε), q2)}, 1)} for all← v ∈ pos(u) εsu,εch), tqha)t} u(v) ∈ ∆(k) for some fko ≥r 0ll li nv p ∈ref ipxo osr(ude)r sduoc 15: ≥Π v0 i←n p ∅r 16: for ←all ∅(z, θ, w) ∈ Πlast do 17: rf aorll a(zll, vθ0, ∈w )lv ∈(z Π) such that z(v0) = ⊥ do 18: 19: 20: 21: 22: 23: 24: 25: 26: 27: 28: , dfoor all(θ(v,v0).u(v)(x1,...,xk) −w →0h)∈R2 θ0 ← θ For←m sθubstitution mapping ϕ : (Q2 X) → TΓ((Q1 Q2 X) {⊥}). f→or Ti = 1to× ×k dQo for all v00 ∈ pos(h) such that h(v00) = (q02 , xi∈) for some q20 ∈ Q2 do θ0(vi, v0v00) ← q20 if u(vi) ←is q of the form (q1, x) ∈ Q1 X then ∪ ,ϕ(x)q20 ∈, x Qi) ←× X((q t1h, eqn20), x) else ϕ(q20, xi) ← ⊥ Πv ← Πv {(z[ϕ)( ←h)] ⊥v0 , θ0, w · w0)} ∪ 29: Πlast ← Πv 30: Z ← {z |← ←(z Π, θ, Xw) 31: return {(z, X ∈ (z ,θ ,wX) X∈Πl Πlast} w) | z ∈ Z} ast X tion, whereas application for trees is obtained by a series of (embed, compose, project) operations. 4.1 On-the-fly algorithms We next consider on-the-fly algorithms for application. Similar to the string case, an on-thefly approach is driven by a calling algorithm that periodically needs to know the productions in a WRTG with a common left side nonterminal. The embed-compose-project approach produces an entire application WRTG before any inference algorithm is run. In order to admit an on-the-fly approach we describe algorithms that only generate those productions in a WRTG that have a given left nonterminal. In this section we extend Definition 3. 1 as follows: a WRTG is a 6tuple G = (N, P, n0,M,G) where N, P, and n0 are defined as in Definition 3. 1, and either M = G = ∅,10 or M is a wxLNT and G is a normMal = =fo Grm =, c ∅h,ain production-free WRTG such that Σ, 10In which case Σ, the definition is functionally unchanged from before. 1062 w t[xLypN] LeT (a)pPresOYNer Qovsateiodn?f(Grwe´ca(Fsd¨uMrg(lKeS¨coa punelgsid cowtihuSza,[rtxlbce1.2i]9,l0Nn2tybT091), 984w [txy](pbL Ne)T PrespvatiosYnNero svfebda?ckw(rFdu¨MlSeo¨c apesgl onwtiuza[r,xlcb.2]ei,NlL0t2yT 91)0 Table 1: Preservation of forward and backward recognizability for various classes of top-down tree transducers.

The complete MB (MA(G).). is shown in Figure 2e. Note that because we used this on-the-fly approach, we were able to avoid building all the productions in MA(G).; in particular we did not build g0a2 − −w2 −· −w →8 ρ, while a bucket brigade approach would −h −a −v −e → →bui ρlt, ,t whish production. We have also designed an analogous onthe-fly PRODUCE algorithm for backward application on linear WTT. We have now defined several on-the-fly and bucket brigade algorithms, and also discussed the possibility of embed-compose-project and offline composition strategies to application of cascades of tree transducers. Tables 2a and 2b summarize the available methods of forward and backward application of cascades for recognizabilitypreserving tree transducer classes. 5 Decoding Experiments The main purpose of this paper has been to present novel algorithms for performing applica- tion. However, it is important to demonstrate these algorithms on real data. We thus demonstrate bucket-brigade and on-the-fly backward application on a typical NLP task cast as a cascade of wLNT. We adapt the Japanese-to-English transla13Note that G2 is the initial stand-in for MB (MA (G).)., since G1 is the initial stand-in for MA (G).. 1064 obomcbtfethodW√ √STwx√L× NTwL√ √NTo mbctbfethodW√ √STw×x√ LTw√ ×LTwxL√ ×NTwL√ √NT (a) Forward application (b) Backward application Table 2: Transducer types and available methods of forward and backward application of a cascade. oc = offline composition, bb = bucket brigade, otf = on the fly. tion model of Yamada and Knight (2001) by transforming it from an English-tree-to-Japanese-string model to an English-tree-to-Japanese-tree model. The Japanese trees are unlabeled, meaning they have syntactic structure but all nodes are labeled “X”. We then cast this modified model as a cascade of LNT tree transducers.

We add an English syntax language model L to theW ceas acdadde a no Ef ntrgalinsshd uscyentras x ju lastn gdueascgrei mbeodd etol L be ttoter simulate an actual machine translation decoding task. The language model is cast as an identity WTT and thus fits naturally into the experimental framework. In our experiments we try several different language models to demonstrate varying performance of the application algorithms. The most realistic language model is a PCFG. Each rule captures the probability of a particular sequence of child labels given a parent label. This model has 7,765 rules. To demonstrate more extreme cases of the usefulness of the on-the-fly approach, we build a language model that recognizes exactly the 2,087 trees in the training corpus, each with equal weight. It has 39,455 rules. Finally, to be ultraspecific, we include a form of the “specific” language model just described, but only allow the English counterpart of the particular Japanese sentence being decoded in the language.

We evaluate the speed of each approach: bucket brigade and on-the-fly. The algorithm we use to obtain the 1-best path is a modification of the kbest algorithm of Pauls and Klein (2009). Our algorithm finds the 1-best path in a WRTG and admits an on-the-fly approach. The results of the experiments are shown in Table 3. As can be seen, on-the-fly application is generally faster than the bucket brigade, about double the speed per sentence in the traditional L1eMp-xcsafe tgcyn tpemb u eo ct hkfoe tdime>/.21s 0.e78465nms tenc Table 3: Timing results to obtain 1-best from application through a weighted tree transducer cascade, using on-the-fly vs. bucket brigade backward application techniques. pcfg = model recognizes any tree licensed by a pcfg built from observed data, exact = model recognizes each of 2,000+ trees with equal weight, 1-sent = model recognizes exactly one tree. experiment that uses an English PCFG language model. The results for the other two language models demonstrate more keenly the potential advantage that an on-the-fly approach provides—the simultaneous incorporation of information from all models allows application to be done more effectively than if each information source is considered in sequence. In the “exact” case, where a very large language model that simply recognizes each of the 2,087 trees in the training corpus is used, the final application is so large that it overwhelms the resources of a 4gb MacBook Pro, while the on-the-fly approach does not suffer from this problem. The “1-sent” case is presented to demonstrate the ripple effect caused by using on-the fly. In the other two cases, a very large language model generally overwhelms the timing statistics, regardless of the method being used. But a language model that represents exactly one sentence is very small, and thus the effects of simultaneous inference are readily apparent—the time to retrieve the 1-best sentence is reduced by two orders of magnitude in this experiment. 6 Conclusion We have presented algorithms for forward and backward application of weighted tree transducer cascades, including on-the-fly variants, and demonstrated the benefit of an on-the-fly approach to application. We note that a more formal approach to application of WTTs is being developed, 1065 independent from these efforts, by F ¨ul ¨op (2010). et al.

We have employed an HMM statistical framework for both speech recognition and synthesis which provides transformation mechanisms to adapt the synthesized voice in TTS (text-to-speech) using the recognized voice in ASR (automatic speech recognition). An important application for this research is personalised speech-to-speech translation that will use the voice of the speaker in the input language to utter the translated sentences in the output language. In mobile environments this enhances the users’ interaction across language barriers by making the output speech sound more like the original speaker’s way of speaking, even if she or he could not speak the output language.</p><p>3 0.95179439 <a title="164-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Learning_Common_Grammar_from_Multilingual_Corpus.html">162 acl-2010-Learning Common Grammar from Multilingual Corpus</a></p>

We also develop a variational method for efficient inference.

Each strategy on its own greatly improves performance over basic expectation-maximization training with a bitag Hidden Markov Model, which we show on the CCGbank and CCG-TUT corpora. The strategies provide further error reductions when combined. We describe a new two-stage integer programming strategy that efficiently deals with the high degree of ambiguity on these datasets while obtaining the full effect of model minimization.</p><p>6 0.85542434 <a title="164-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-The_Importance_of_Rule_Restrictions_in_CCG.html">228 acl-2010-The Importance of Rule Restrictions in CCG</a></p>

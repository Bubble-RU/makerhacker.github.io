<p>Author: Nancy Ide ; Collin Baker ; Christiane Fellbaum ; Rebecca Passonneau</p><p>Abstract: The Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC) project provides data and annotations to serve as the base for a communitywide annotation effort of a subset of the American National Corpus. The MASC infrastructure enables the incorporation of contributed annotations into a single, usable format that can then be analyzed as it is or ported to any of a variety of other formats. MASC includes data from a much wider variety of genres than existing multiply-annotated corpora of English, and the project is committed to a fully open model of distribution, without restriction, for all data and annotations produced or contributed. As such, MASC is the first large-scale, open, communitybased effort to create much needed language resources for NLP. This paper describes the MASC project, its corpus and annotations, and serves as a call for contributions of data and annotations from the language processing community.</p><p>3 0.61342794 <a title="259-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-The_Human_Language_Project%3A_Building_a_Universal_Corpus_of_the_World%27s_Languages.html">226 acl-2010-The Human Language Project: Building a Universal Corpus of the World's Languages</a></p>

In order to validate this adaptation, we use the obtained data to replicate some results in the literature that used the original English data. The fact that comparable results are obtained indicates that our approach can be used successfully to rapidly create semantically annotated resources for new languages.</p><p>6 0.4882634 <a title="259-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Classification_of_Feedback_Expressions_in_Multimodal_Data.html">58 acl-2010-Classification of Feedback Expressions in Multimodal Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Shasha Li ; Chin-Yew Lin ; Young-In Song ; Zhoujun Li</p><p>Abstract: Comparing one thing with another is a typical part of human decision making process. However, it is not always easy to know what to compare and what are the alternatives. To address this difficulty, we present a novel way to automatically mine comparable entities from comparative questions that users posted online. To ensure high precision and high recall, we develop a weakly-supervised bootstrapping method for comparative question identification and comparable entity extraction by leveraging a large online question archive. The experimental results show our method achieves F1measure of 82.5% in comparative question identification and 83.3% in comparable entity extraction. Both significantly outperform an existing state-of-the-art method. 1</p><p>2 0.94751602 <a title="259-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-A_Framework_for_Figurative_Language_Detection_Based_on_Sense_Differentiation.html">5 acl-2010-A Framework for Figurative Language Detection Based on Sense Differentiation</a></p>
<p>Author: Daria Bogdanova</p><p>Abstract: Various text mining algorithms require the process offeature selection. High-level semantically rich features, such as figurative language uses, speech errors etc., are very promising for such problems as e.g. writing style detection, but automatic extraction of such features is a big challenge. In this paper, we propose a framework for figurative language use detection. This framework is based on the idea of sense differentiation. We describe two algorithms illustrating the mentioned idea. We show then how these algorithms work by applying them to Russian language data.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.90592158 <a title="259-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-WebLicht%3A_Web-Based_LRT_Services_for_German.html">259 acl-2010-WebLicht: Web-Based LRT Services for German</a></p>

<p>Author: Nils Reiter ; Anette Frank</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a supervised approach for identifying generic noun phrases in context. Generic statements express rulelike knowledge about kinds or events. Therefore, their identification is important for the automatic construction of knowledge bases. In particular, the distinction between generic and non-generic statements is crucial for the correct encoding of generic and instance-level information. Generic expressions have been studied extensively in formal semantics. Building on this work, we explore a corpus-based learning approach for identifying generic NPs, using selections of linguistically motivated features. Our results perform well above the baseline and existing prior work.</p><p>5 0.76768756 <a title="259-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-A_Transition-Based_Parser_for_2-Planar_Dependency_Structures.html">20 acl-2010-A Transition-Based Parser for 2-Planar Dependency Structures</a></p>
<p>Author: Carlos Gomez-Rodriguez ; Joakim Nivre</p><p>Abstract: Finding a class of structures that is rich enough for adequate linguistic representation yet restricted enough for efficient computational processing is an important problem for dependency parsing. In this paper, we present a transition system for 2-planar dependency trees trees that can be decomposed into at most two planar graphs and show that it can be used to implement a classifier-based parser that runs in linear time and outperforms a stateof-the-art transition-based parser on four data sets from the CoNLL-X shared task. In addition, we present an efficient method – – for determining whether an arbitrary tree is 2-planar and show that 99% or more of the trees in existing treebanks are 2-planar.</p><p>6 0.66771281 <a title="259-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Distributional_Similarity_vs._PU_Learning_for_Entity_Set_Expansion.html">89 acl-2010-Distributional Similarity vs. PU Learning for Entity Set Expansion</a></p>

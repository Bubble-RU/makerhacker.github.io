<p>Author: Weiwei Guo ; Mona Diab</p><p>Abstract: Word Sense Disambiguation remains one ofthe most complex problems facing computational linguists to date. In this paper we present a system that combines evidence from a monolingual WSD system together with that from a multilingual WSD system to yield state of the art performance on standard All-Words data sets. The monolingual system is based on a modification ofthe graph based state ofthe art algorithm In-Degree. The multilingual system is an improvement over an AllWords unsupervised approach, SALAAM. SALAAM exploits multilingual evidence as a means of disambiguation. In this paper, we present modifications to both of the original approaches and then their combination. We finally report the highest results obtained to date on the SENSEVAL 2 standard data set using an unsupervised method, we achieve an overall F measure of 64.58 using a voting scheme.</p><p>3 0.29500678 <a title="152-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Topic_Models_for_Word_Sense_Disambiguation_and_Token-Based_Idiom_Detection.html">237 acl-2010-Topic Models for Word Sense Disambiguation and Token-Based Idiom Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Linlin Li ; Benjamin Roth ; Caroline Sporleder</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic model for sense disambiguation which chooses the best sense based on the conditional probability of sense paraphrases given a context. We use a topic model to decompose this conditional probability into two conditional probabilities with latent variables. We propose three different instantiations of the model for solving sense disambiguation problems with different degrees of resource availability. The proposed models are tested on three different tasks: coarse-grained word sense disambiguation, fine-grained word sense disambiguation, and detection of literal vs. nonliteral usages of potentially idiomatic expressions. In all three cases, we outper- form state-of-the-art systems either quantitatively or statistically significantly.</p><p>4 0.25960916 <a title="152-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-WSD_as_a_Distributed_Constraint_Optimization_Problem.html">257 acl-2010-WSD as a Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem</a></p>

To model WSD as a DCOP, we view information from various knowledge sources as constraints. DCOP algorithms have the remarkable property to jointly maximize over a wide range of utility functions associated with these constraints. We show how utility functions can be designed for various knowledge sources. For the purpose of evaluation, we modelled all words WSD as a simple DCOP problem.

<p>Author: Mitesh Khapra ; Anup Kulkarni ; Saurabh Sohoney ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: In spite of decades of research on word sense disambiguation (WSD), all-words general purpose WSD has remained a distant goal. Many supervised WSD systems have been built, but the effort of creating the training corpus - annotated sense marked corpora - has always been a matter of concern. Therefore, attempts have been made to develop unsupervised and knowledge based techniques for WSD which do not need sense marked corpora. However such approaches have not proved effective, since they typically do not better Wordnet first sense baseline accuracy. Our research reported here proposes to stick to the supervised approach, but with far less demand on annotation. We show that if we have ANY sense marked corpora, be it from mixed domain or a specific domain, a small amount of annotation in ANY other domain can deliver the goods almost as if exhaustive sense marking were available in that domain. We have tested our approach across Tourism and Health domain corpora, using also the well known mixed domain SemCor corpus. Accuracy figures close to self domain training lend credence to the viability of our approach. Our contribution thus lies in finding a convenient middle ground between pure supervised and pure unsupervised WSD. Finally, our approach is not restricted to any specific set of target words, a departure from a commonly observed practice in domain specific WSD.</p><p>5 0.65866816 <a title="152-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Topic_Models_for_Word_Sense_Disambiguation_and_Token-Based_Idiom_Detection.html">237 acl-2010-Topic Models for Word Sense Disambiguation and Token-Based Idiom Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: David Vickrey ; Oscar Kipersztok ; Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel system that helps nonexperts find sets of similar words. The user begins by specifying one or more seed words. The system then iteratively suggests a series of candidate words, which the user can either accept or reject. Current techniques for this task typically bootstrap a classifier based on a fixed seed set. In contrast, our system involves the user throughout the labeling process, using active learning to intelligently explore the space of similar words. In particular, our system can take advantage of negative examples provided by the user. Our system combines multiple preexisting sources of similarity data (a standard thesaurus, WordNet, contextual similarity), enabling it to capture many types of similarity groups (“synonyms of crash,” “types of car,” etc.). We evaluate on a hand-labeled evaluation set; our system improves over a strong baseline by 36%.</p><p>3 0.87873423 <a title="152-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Sentence_and_Expression_Level_Annotation_of_Opinions_in_User-Generated_Discourse.html">208 acl-2010-Sentence and Expression Level Annotation of Opinions in User-Generated Discourse</a></p>

In the second stage, on-topic sentences containing evaluations about the topic are further investigated at the expression level for pinpointing the properties (semantic orientation, intensity), and the functional components of the evaluations (opinion terms, targets and holders). We discuss the annotation scheme, the inter-annotator agreement for different subtasks and our observations.</p><p>4 0.83579928 <a title="152-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Automatic_Selectional_Preference_Acquisition_for_Latin_Verbs.html">41 acl-2010-Automatic Selectional Preference Acquisition for Latin Verbs</a></p>
<p>Author: Barbara McGillivray</p><p>Abstract: We present a system that automatically induces Selectional Preferences (SPs) for Latin verbs from two treebanks by using Latin WordNet. Our method overcomes some of the problems connected with data sparseness and the small size of the input corpora. We also suggest a way to evaluate the acquired SPs on unseen events extracted from other Latin corpora.</p><p>5 0.83491838 <a title="152-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-The_Manually_Annotated_Sub-Corpus%3A_A_Community_Resource_for_and_by_the_People.html">230 acl-2010-The Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus: A Community Resource for and by the People</a></p>
<p>Author: Nancy Ide ; Collin Baker ; Christiane Fellbaum ; Rebecca Passonneau</p><p>Abstract: The Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC) project provides data and annotations to serve as the base for a communitywide annotation effort of a subset of the American National Corpus. The MASC infrastructure enables the incorporation of contributed annotations into a single, usable format that can then be analyzed as it is or ported to any of a variety of other formats. MASC includes data from a much wider variety of genres than existing multiply-annotated corpora of English, and the project is committed to a fully open model of distribution, without restriction, for all data and annotations produced or contributed. As such, MASC is the first large-scale, open, communitybased effort to create much needed language resources for NLP. This paper describes the MASC project, its corpus and annotations, and serves as a call for contributions of data and annotations from the language processing community.</p><p>6 0.74303055 <a title="152-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Combining_Orthogonal_Monolingual_and_Multilingual_Sources_of_Evidence_for_All_Words_WSD.html">62 acl-2010-Combining Orthogonal Monolingual and Multilingual Sources of Evidence for All Words WSD</a></p>

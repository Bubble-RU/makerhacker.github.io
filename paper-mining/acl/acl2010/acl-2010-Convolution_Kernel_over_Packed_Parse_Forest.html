<p>Author: WenTing Wang ; Jian Su ; Chew Lim Tan</p><p>Abstract: Syntactic knowledge is important for discourse relation recognition. Yet only heuristically selected flat paths and 2-level production rules have been used to incorporate such information so far. In this paper we propose using tree kernel based approach to automatically mine the syntactic information from the parse trees for discourse analysis, applying kernel function to the tree structures directly. These structural syntactic features, together with other normal flat features are incorporated into our composite kernel to capture diverse knowledge for simultaneous discourse identification and classification for both explicit and implicit relations. The experiment shows tree kernel approach is able to give statistical significant improvements over flat syntactic path feature. We also illustrate that tree kernel approach covers more structure information than the production rules, which allows tree kernel to further incorporate information from a higher dimension space for possible better discrimination. Besides, we further propose to leverage on temporal ordering information to constrain the interpretation of discourse relation, which also demonstrate statistical significant improvements for discourse relation recognition on PDTB 2.0 for both explicit and implicit as well.

<p>Author: Haitao Mi ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: Tree-to-string systems (and their forestbased extensions) have gained steady popularity thanks to their simplicity and efficiency, but there is a major limitation: they are unable to guarantee the grammaticality of the output, which is explicitly modeled in string-to-tree systems via targetside syntax. We thus propose to combine the advantages of both, and present a novel constituency-to-dependency translation model, which uses constituency forests on the source side to direct the translation, and dependency trees on the target side (as a language model) to ensure grammaticality. Medium-scale experiments show an absolute and statistically significant improvement of +0.7 BLEU points over a state-of-the-art forest-based tree-to-string system even with fewer rules.

<p>Author: Jun Sun ; Min Zhang ; Chew Lim Tan</p><p>Abstract: We propose Bilingual Tree Kernels (BTKs) to capture the structural similarities across a pair of syntactic translational equivalences and apply BTKs to sub-tree alignment along with some plain features. Our study reveals that the structural features embedded in a bilingual parse tree pair are very effective for sub-tree alignment and the bilingual tree kernels can well capture such features. The experimental results show that our approach achieves a significant improvement on both gold standard tree bank and automatically parsed tree pairs against a heuristic similarity based method. We further apply the sub-tree alignment in machine translation with two methods. It is suggested that the subtree alignment benefits both phrase and syntax based systems by relaxing the constraint of the word alignment. 1</p><p>5 0.28063095 <a title="71-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Tree-Based_and_Forest-Based_Translation.html">243 acl-2010-Tree-Based and Forest-Based Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Timothy A. D. Fowler ; Gerald Penn</p><p>Abstract: The definition of combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) in the literature varies quite a bit from author to author. However, the differences between the definitions are important in terms of the language classes of each CCG. We prove that a wide range of CCGs are strongly context-free, including the CCG of CCGbank and of the parser of Clark and Curran (2007). In light of these new results, we train the PCFG parser of Petrov and Klein (2007) on CCGbank and achieve state of the art results in supertagging accuracy, PARSEVAL measures and dependency accuracy.</p><p>3 0.67156041 <a title="71-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Rebanking_CCGbank_for_Improved_NP_Interpretation.html">203 acl-2010-Rebanking CCGbank for Improved NP Interpretation</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Honnibal ; James R. Curran ; Johan Bos</p><p>Abstract: Once released, treebanks tend to remain unchanged despite any shortcomings in their depth of linguistic analysis or coverage of specific phenomena. Instead, separate resources are created to address such problems. In this paper we show how to improve the quality of a treebank, by integrating resources and implementing improved analyses for specific constructions. We demonstrate this rebanking process by creating an updated version of CCGbank that includes the predicate-argument structure of both verbs and nouns, baseNP brackets, verb-particle constructions, and restrictive and non-restrictive nominal modifiers; and evaluate the impact of these changes on a statistical parser.</p><p>4 0.67096549 <a title="71-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Training_Phrase_Translation_Models_with_Leaving-One-Out.html">240 acl-2010-Training Phrase Translation Models with Leaving-One-Out</a></p>
<p>Author: Joern Wuebker ; Arne Mauser ; Hermann Ney</p><p>Abstract: Several attempts have been made to learn phrase translation probabilities for phrasebased statistical machine translation that go beyond pure counting of phrases in word-aligned training data. Most approaches report problems with overfitting. We describe a novel leavingone-out approach to prevent over-fitting that allows us to train phrase models that show improved translation performance on the WMT08 Europarl German-English task. In contrast to most previous work where phrase models were trained separately from other models used in translation, we include all components such as single word lexica and reordering mod- els in training. Using this consistent training of phrase models we are able to achieve improvements of up to 1.4 points in BLEU. As a side effect, the phrase table size is reduced by more than 80%.</p><p>5 0.66976166 <a title="71-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Constituency_to_Dependency_Translation_with_Forests.html">69 acl-2010-Constituency to Dependency Translation with Forests</a></p>

<p>Author: Srinivasan Janarthanam ; Oliver Lemon</p><p>Abstract: We present a data-driven approach to learn user-adaptive referring expression generation (REG) policies for spoken dialogue systems. Referring expressions can be difficult to understand in technical domains where users may not know the technical ‘jargon’ names of the domain entities. In such cases, dialogue systems must be able to model the user’s (lexical) domain knowledge and use appropriate referring expressions. We present a reinforcement learning (RL) framework in which the sys- tem learns REG policies which can adapt to unknown users online. Furthermore, unlike supervised learning methods which require a large corpus of expert adaptive behaviour to train on, we show that effective adaptive policies can be learned from a small dialogue corpus of non-adaptive human-machine interaction, by using a RL framework and a statistical user simulation. We show that in comparison to adaptive hand-coded baseline policies, the learned policy performs significantly better, with an 18.6% average increase in adaptation accuracy. The best learned policy also takes less dialogue time (average 1.07 min less) than the best hand-coded policy. This is because the learned policies can adapt online to changing evidence about the user’s domain expertise.</p><p>3 0.22551793 <a title="187-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Towards_Relational_POMDPs_for_Adaptive_Dialogue_Management.html">239 acl-2010-Towards Relational POMDPs for Adaptive Dialogue Management</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre Lison</p><p>Abstract: Open-ended spoken interactions are typically characterised by both structural complexity and high levels of uncertainty, making dialogue management in such settings a particularly challenging problem. Traditional approaches have focused on providing theoretical accounts for either the uncertainty or the complexity of spoken dialogue, but rarely considered the two issues simultaneously. This paper describes ongoing work on a new approach to dialogue management which attempts to fill this gap. We represent the interaction as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) over a rich state space incorporating both dialogue, user, and environment models. The tractability of the resulting POMDP can be preserved using a mechanism for dynamically constraining the action space based on prior knowledge over locally relevant dialogue structures. These constraints are encoded in a small set of general rules expressed as a Markov Logic network. The first-order expressivity of Markov Logic enables us to leverage the rich relational structure of the problem and efficiently abstract over large regions ofthe state and action spaces.</p><p>4 0.17723092 <a title="187-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Phrase-Based_Statistical_Language_Generation_Using_Graphical_Models_and_Active_Learning.html">194 acl-2010-Phrase-Based Statistical Language Generation Using Graphical Models and Active Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Francois Mairesse ; Milica Gasic ; Filip Jurcicek ; Simon Keizer ; Blaise Thomson ; Kai Yu ; Steve Young</p><p>Abstract: Most previous work on trainable language generation has focused on two paradigms: (a) using a statistical model to rank a set of generated utterances, or (b) using statistics to inform the generation decision process. Both approaches rely on the existence of a handcrafted generator, which limits their scalability to new domains. This paper presents BAGEL, a statistical language generator which uses dynamic Bayesian networks to learn from semantically-aligned data produced by 42 untrained annotators. A human evaluation shows that BAGEL can generate natural and informative utterances from unseen inputs in the information presentation domain. Additionally, generation perfor- mance on sparse datasets is improved significantly by using certainty-based active learning, yielding ratings close to the human gold standard with a fraction of the data.</p><p>5 0.16399157 <a title="187-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Importance-Driven_Turn-Bidding_for_Spoken_Dialogue_Systems.html">142 acl-2010-Importance-Driven Turn-Bidding for Spoken Dialogue Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Ethan Selfridge ; Peter Heeman</p><p>Abstract: Current turn-taking approaches for spoken dialogue systems rely on the speaker releasing the turn before the other can take it. This reliance results in restricted interactions that can lead to inefficient dialogues. In this paper we present a model we refer to as Importance-Driven Turn-Bidding that treats turn-taking as a negotiative process. Each conversant bids for the turn based on the importance of the intended utterance, and Reinforcement Learning is used to indirectly learn this parameter. We find that Importance-Driven Turn-Bidding performs better than two current turntaking approaches in an artificial collaborative slot-filling domain. The negotiative nature of this model creates efficient dia- logues, and supports the improvement of mixed-initiative interaction.</p><p>6 0.141545 <a title="187-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Beetle_II%3A_A_System_for_Tutoring_and_Computational_Linguistics_Experimentation.html">47 acl-2010-Beetle II: A System for Tutoring and Computational Linguistics Experimentation</a></p>

<p>Author: Steven Abney ; Steven Bird</p><p>Abstract: We present a grand challenge to build a corpus that will include all of the world’s languages, in a consistent structure that permits large-scale cross-linguistic processing, enabling the study of universal linguistics. The focal data types, bilingual texts and lexicons, relate each language to one of a set of reference languages. We propose that the ability to train systems to translate into and out of a given language be the yardstick for determining when we have successfully captured a language. We call on the computational linguistics community to begin work on this Universal Corpus, pursuing the many strands of activity described here, as their contribution to the global effort to document the world’s linguistic heritage before more languages fall silent.</p><p>2 0.96942675 <a title="187-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Online_Generation_of_Locality_Sensitive_Hash_Signatures.html">183 acl-2010-Online Generation of Locality Sensitive Hash Signatures</a></p>

We show that the optimised policies significantly outperform the baselines in a variety of generation scenarios: while the supervised model is able to attain up to 87.6% of the possible reward on this task, the RL policies are significantly better in 5 out of 6 scenarios, gaining up to 91.5% of the total possible reward. The RL policies perform especially well in more complex scenarios. We are also the first to show that adding predictive “lower level” features (e.g. from the NLG realiser) is important for optimising IP strategies according to user preferences. This provides new insights into the nature of the IP problem for SDS.</p><p>4 0.92428833 <a title="187-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Weakly_Supervised_Learning_of_Presupposition_Relations_between_Verbs.html">258 acl-2010-Weakly Supervised Learning of Presupposition Relations between Verbs</a></p>
<p>Author: Galina Tremper</p><p>Abstract: Presupposition relations between verbs are not very well covered in existing lexical semantic resources. We propose a weakly supervised algorithm for learning presupposition relations between verbs that distinguishes five semantic relations: presupposition, entailment, temporal inclusion, antonymy and other/no relation. We start with a number of seed verb pairs selected manually for each semantic relation and classify unseen verb pairs. Our algorithm achieves an overall accuracy of 36% for type-based classification.</p><p>5 0.89490604 <a title="187-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-How_Many_Words_Is_a_Picture_Worth%3F_Automatic_Caption_Generation_for_News_Images.html">136 acl-2010-How Many Words Is a Picture Worth? Automatic Caption Generation for News Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Yansong Feng ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we tackle the problem of automatic caption generation for news images. Our approach leverages the vast resource of pictures available on the web and the fact that many of them are captioned. Inspired by recent work in summarization, we propose extractive and abstractive caption generation models. They both operate over the output of a probabilistic image annotation model that preprocesses the pictures and suggests keywords to describe their content. Experimental results show that an abstractive model defined over phrases is superior to extractive methods.</p><p>6 0.8653056 <a title="187-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Semantic_Parsing%3A_The_Task%2C_the_State_of_the_Art_and_the_Future.html">206 acl-2010-Semantic Parsing: The Task, the State of the Art and the Future</a></p>

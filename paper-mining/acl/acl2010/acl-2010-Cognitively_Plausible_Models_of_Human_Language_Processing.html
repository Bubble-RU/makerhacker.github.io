<p>Author: Jeff Mitchell ; Mirella Lapata ; Vera Demberg ; Frank Keller</p><p>Abstract: The analysis of reading times can provide insights into the processes that underlie language comprehension, with longer reading times indicating greater cognitive load. There is evidence that the language processor is highly predictive, such that prior context allows upcoming linguistic material to be anticipated. Previous work has investigated the contributions of semantic and syntactic contexts in isolation, essentially treating them as independent factors. In this paper we analyze reading times in terms of a single predictive measure which integrates a model of semantic composition with an incremental parser and a language model.</p><p>3 0.32547885 <a title="59-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-The_Influence_of_Discourse_on_Syntax%3A_A_Psycholinguistic_Model_of_Sentence_Processing.html">229 acl-2010-The Influence of Discourse on Syntax: A Psycholinguistic Model of Sentence Processing</a></p>
<p>Author: Amit Dubey</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic models of sentence comprehension are increasingly relevant to questions concerning human language processing. However, such models are often limited to syntactic factors. This paper introduces a novel sentence processing model that consists of a parser augmented with a probabilistic logic-based model of coreference resolution, which allows us to simulate how context interacts with syntax in a reading task. Our simulations show that a Weakly Interactive cognitive architecture can explain data which had been provided as evidence for the Strongly Interactive hypothesis.</p><p>4 0.22757904 <a title="59-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-A_Cognitive_Cost_Model_of_Annotations_Based_on_Eye-Tracking_Data.html">4 acl-2010-A Cognitive Cost Model of Annotations Based on Eye-Tracking Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Katrin Tomanek ; Udo Hahn ; Steffen Lohmann ; Jurgen Ziegler</p><p>Abstract: We report on an experiment to track complex decision points in linguistic metadata annotation where the decision behavior of annotators is observed with an eyetracking device. As experimental conditions we investigate different forms of textual context and linguistic complexity classes relative to syntax and semantics. Our data renders evidence that annotation performance depends on the semantic and syntactic complexity of the decision points and, more interestingly, indicates that fullscale context is mostly negligible with – the exception of semantic high-complexity cases. We then induce from this observational data a cognitively grounded cost model of linguistic meta-data annotations and compare it with existing non-cognitive models. Our data reveals that the cognitively founded model explains annotation costs (expressed in annotation time) more adequately than non-cognitive ones.</p><p>5 0.20661056 <a title="59-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Complexity_Metrics_in_an_Incremental_Right-Corner_Parser.html">65 acl-2010-Complexity Metrics in an Incremental Right-Corner Parser</a></p>

<p>Author: Klinton Bicknell ; Roger Levy</p><p>Abstract: A number of results in the study of realtime sentence comprehension have been explained by computational models as resulting from the rational use of probabilistic linguistic information. Many times, these hypotheses have been tested in reading by linking predictions about relative word difficulty to word-aggregated eye tracking measures such as go-past time. In this paper, we extend these results by asking to what extent reading is well-modeled as rational behavior at a finer level of analysis, predicting not aggregate measures, but the duration and location of each fixation. We present a new rational model of eye movement control in reading, the central assumption of which is that eye move- ment decisions are made to obtain noisy visual information as the reader performs Bayesian inference on the identities of the words in the sentence. As a case study, we present two simulations demonstrating that the model gives a rational explanation for between-word regressions.</p><p>6 0.574763 <a title="59-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Last_but_Definitely_Not_Least%3A_On_the_Role_of_the_Last_Sentence_in_Automatic_Polarity-Classification.html">157 acl-2010-Last but Definitely Not Least: On the Role of the Last Sentence in Automatic Polarity-Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Daniil Umanski ; Federico Sangati</p><p>Abstract: The growing availability of spoken language corpora presents new opportunities for enriching the methodologies of speech and language therapy. In this paper, we present a novel approach for constructing speech motor exercises, based on linguistic knowledge extracted from spoken language corpora. In our study with the Dutch Spoken Corpus, syllabic inventories were obtained by means of automatic syllabification of the spoken language data. Our experimental syllabification method exhibited a reliable performance, and allowed for the acquisition of syllabic tokens from the corpus. Consequently, the syl- labic tokens were integrated in a tool for clinicians, a result which holds the potential of contributing to the current state of speech motor training methodologies.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.75517452 <a title="59-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Cognitively_Plausible_Models_of_Human_Language_Processing.html">59 acl-2010-Cognitively Plausible Models of Human Language Processing</a></p>

<p>Author: Zornitsa Kozareva ; Eduard Hovy</p><p>Abstract: A challenging problem in open information extraction and text mining is the learning of the selectional restrictions of semantic relations. We propose a minimally supervised bootstrapping algorithm that uses a single seed and a recursive lexico-syntactic pattern to learn the arguments and the supertypes of a diverse set of semantic relations from the Web. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on multiple semantic relations expressed using “verb”, “noun”, and “verb prep” lexico-syntactic patterns. Humanbased evaluation shows that the accuracy of the harvested information is about 90%. We also compare our results with existing knowledge base to outline the similarities and differences of the granularity and diversity of the harvested knowledge.</p><p>4 0.64948857 <a title="59-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Correcting_Errors_in_a_Treebank_Based_on_Synchronous_Tree_Substitution_Grammar.html">75 acl-2010-Correcting Errors in a Treebank Based on Synchronous Tree Substitution Grammar</a></p>

By using a synchronous grammar, the method transforms parse trees containing annotation errors into the ones whose errors are corrected. The synchronous grammar is automatically induced from the treebank. We report an experimental result of applying our method to the Penn Treebank. The result demonstrates that our method corrects syntactic annotation errors with high precision.</p><p>5 0.63203931 <a title="59-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Complexity_Metrics_in_an_Incremental_Right-Corner_Parser.html">65 acl-2010-Complexity Metrics in an Incremental Right-Corner Parser</a></p>

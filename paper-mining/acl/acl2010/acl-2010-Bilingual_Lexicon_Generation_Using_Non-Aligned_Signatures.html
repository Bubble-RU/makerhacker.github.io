<p>Author: Bin Wei ; Christopher Pal</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of using an annotated corpus in English for the same natural language processing task in another language. While various machine translation systems are available, automated translation is still far from perfect. To minimize the noise introduced by translations, we propose to use only key ‘reliable” parts from the translations and apply structural correspondence learning (SCL) to find a low dimensional representation shared by the two languages. We perform experiments on an EnglishChinese sentiment classification task and compare our results with a previous cotraining approach. To alleviate the problem of data sparseness, we create extra pseudo-examples for SCL by making queries to a search engine. Experiments on real-world on-line review data demonstrate the two techniques can effectively improvetheperformancecomparedtoprevious work.</p><p>3 0.22027582 <a title="50-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Cross-Language_Text_Classification_Using_Structural_Correspondence_Learning.html">78 acl-2010-Cross-Language Text Classification Using Structural Correspondence Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Prettenhofer ; Benno Stein</p><p>Abstract: We present a new approach to crosslanguage text classification that builds on structural correspondence learning, a recently proposed theory for domain adaptation. The approach uses unlabeled documents, along with a simple word translation oracle, in order to induce taskspecific, cross-lingual word correspondences. We report on analyses that reveal quantitative insights about the use of unlabeled data and the complexity of interlanguage correspondence modeling. We conduct experiments in the field of cross-language sentiment classification, employing English as source language, and German, French, and Japanese as target languages. The results are convincing; they demonstrate both the robustness and the competitiveness of the presented ideas.</p><p>4 0.18798929 <a title="50-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Generating_Focused_Topic-Specific_Sentiment_Lexicons.html">123 acl-2010-Generating Focused Topic-Specific Sentiment Lexicons</a></p>
<p>Author: Valentin Jijkoun ; Maarten de Rijke ; Wouter Weerkamp</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for automatically generating focused and accurate topicspecific subjectivity lexicons from a general purpose polarity lexicon that allow users to pin-point subjective on-topic information in a set of relevant documents. We motivate the need for such lexicons in the field of media analysis, describe a bootstrapping method for generating a topic-specific lexicon from a general purpose polarity lexicon, and evaluate the quality of the generated lexicons both manually and using a TREC Blog track test set for opinionated blog post retrieval. Although the generated lexicons can be an order of magnitude more selective than the general purpose lexicon, they maintain, or even improve, the performance of an opin- ion retrieval system.</p><p>5 0.1538326 <a title="50-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Bilingual_Sense_Similarity_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">51 acl-2010-Bilingual Sense Similarity for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Boxing Chen ; George Foster ; Roland Kuhn</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes new algorithms to compute the sense similarity between two units (words, phrases, rules, etc.) from parallel corpora. The sense similarity scores are computed by using the vector space model. We then apply the algorithms to statistical machine translation by computing the sense similarity between the source and target side of translation rule pairs. Similarity scores are used as additional features of the translation model to improve translation performance. Significant improvements are obtained over a state-of-the-art hierarchical phrase-based machine translation system. 1</p><p>6 0.14744821 <a title="50-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-A_New_Approach_to_Improving_Multilingual_Summarization_Using_a_Genetic_Algorithm.html">11 acl-2010-A New Approach to Improving Multilingual Summarization Using a Genetic Algorithm</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiangyu Duan ; Min Zhang ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: The pipeline of most Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation (PB-SMT) systems starts from automatically word aligned parallel corpus. But word appears to be too fine-grained in some cases such as non-compositional phrasal equivalences, where no clear word alignments exist. Using words as inputs to PBSMT pipeline has inborn deficiency. This paper proposes pseudo-word as a new start point for PB-SMT pipeline. Pseudo-word is a kind of basic multi-word expression that characterizes minimal sequence of consecutive words in sense of translation. By casting pseudo-word searching problem into a parsing framework, we search for pseudo-words in a monolingual way and a bilingual synchronous way. Experiments show that pseudo-word significantly outperforms word for PB-SMT model in both travel translation domain and news translation domain. 1</p><p>5 0.47030216 <a title="50-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Evaluating_Multilanguage-Comparability_of_Subjectivity_Analysis_Systems.html">105 acl-2010-Evaluating Multilanguage-Comparability of Subjectivity Analysis Systems</a></p>

Along with its applications to various NLP tasks, much work have put efforts into multilingual subjectivity learning from existing resources. Multilingual subjectivity analysis requires language-independent criteria for comparable outcomes across languages. This paper proposes to measure the multilanguage-comparability of subjectivity analysis tools, and provides meaningful comparisons of multilingual subjectivity analysis from various points of view.</p><p>6 0.44534025 <a title="50-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Bilingual_Sense_Similarity_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">51 acl-2010-Bilingual Sense Similarity for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Rasoul Samad Zadeh Kaljahi</p><p>Abstract: Supervised semantic role labeling (SRL) systems trained on hand-crafted annotated corpora have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, creating such corpora is tedious and costly, with the resulting corpora not sufficiently representative of the language. This paper describes a part of an ongoing work on applying bootstrapping methods to SRL to deal with this problem. Previous work shows that, due to the complexity of SRL, this task is not straight forward. One major difficulty is the propagation of classification noise into the successive iterations. We address this problem by employing balancing and preselection methods for self-training, as a bootstrapping algorithm. The proposed methods could achieve improvement over the base line, which do not use these methods. 1</p><p>3 0.71299893 <a title="50-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Contextualizing_Semantic_Representations_Using_Syntactically_Enriched_Vector_Models.html">70 acl-2010-Contextualizing Semantic Representations Using Syntactically Enriched Vector Models</a></p>

It employs a systematic combination of first- and second-order context vectors. We apply our model to two different tasks and show that (i) it substantially outperforms previous work on a paraphrase ranking task, and (ii) achieves promising results on a wordsense similarity task; to our knowledge, it is the first time that an unsupervised method has been applied to this task.</p><p>4 0.71209824 <a title="50-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Bridging_SMT_and_TM_with_Translation_Recommendation.html">56 acl-2010-Bridging SMT and TM with Translation Recommendation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yifan He ; Yanjun Ma ; Josef van Genabith ; Andy Way</p><p>Abstract: We propose a translation recommendation framework to integrate Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) output with Translation Memory (TM) systems. The framework recommends SMT outputs to a TM user when it predicts that SMT outputs are more suitable for post-editing than the hits provided by the TM. We describe an implementation of this framework using an SVM binary classifier. We exploit methods to fine-tune the classifier and investigate a variety of features of different types. We rely on automatic MT evaluation metrics to approximate human judgements in our experiments. Experimental results show that our system can achieve 0.85 precision at 0.89 recall, excluding ex- act matches. Furthermore, it is possible for the end-user to achieve a desired balance between precision and recall by adjusting confidence levels.</p><p>5 0.71165454 <a title="50-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Bootstrapping_Semantic_Analyzers_from_Non-Contradictory_Texts.html">55 acl-2010-Bootstrapping Semantic Analyzers from Non-Contradictory Texts</a></p>

A simple and efficient inference method recursively induces joint semantic representations for each group and discovers correspondence between lexical entries and latent semantic concepts. We consider the generative semantics-text correspondence model (Liang et al., 2009) and demonstrate that exploiting the noncontradiction relation between texts leads to substantial improvements over natural baselines on a problem of analyzing human-written weather forecasts.</p><p>6 0.71051097 <a title="50-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-A_Risk_Minimization_Framework_for_Extractive_Speech_Summarization.html">14 acl-2010-A Risk Minimization Framework for Extractive Speech Summarization</a></p>

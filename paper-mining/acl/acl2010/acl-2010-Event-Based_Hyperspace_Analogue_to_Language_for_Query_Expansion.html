<p>Author: Xiao Li</p><p>Abstract: Determining the semantic intent of web queries not only involves identifying their semantic class, which is a primary focus of previous works, but also understanding their semantic structure. In this work, we formally define the semantic structure of noun phrase queries as comprised of intent heads and intent modifiers.

<p>Author: Manoj Kumar Chinnakotla ; Karthik Raman ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: In a previous work of ours Chinnakotla et al. (2010) we introduced a novel framework for Pseudo-Relevance Feedback (PRF) called MultiPRF. Given a query in one language called Source, we used English as the Assisting Language to improve the performance of PRF for the source language. MulitiPRF showed remarkable improvement over plain Model Based Feedback (MBF) uniformly for 4 languages, viz., French, German, Hungarian and Finnish with English as the assisting language. This fact inspired us to study the effect of any source-assistant pair on MultiPRF performance from out of a set of languages with widely different characteristics, viz., Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German and Spanish. Carrying this further, we looked into the effect of using two assisting languages together on PRF. The present paper is a report of these investigations, their results and conclusions drawn therefrom. While performance improvement on MultiPRF is observed whatever the assisting language and whatever the source, observations are mixed when two assisting languages are used simultaneously. Interestingly, the performance improvement is more pronounced when the source and assisting languages are closely related, e.g., French and Spanish.</p><p>4 0.12280511 <a title="106-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-The_S-Space_Package%3A_An_Open_Source_Package_for_Word_Space_Models.html">232 acl-2010-The S-Space Package: An Open Source Package for Word Space Models</a></p>
<p>Author: David Jurgens ; Keith Stevens</p><p>Abstract: We present the S-Space Package, an open source framework for developing and evaluating word space algorithms. The package implements well-known word space algorithms, such as LSA, and provides a comprehensive set of matrix utilities and data structures for extending new or existing models. The package also includes word space benchmarks for evaluation. Both algorithms and libraries are designed for high concurrency and scalability. We demonstrate the efficiency of the reference implementations and also provide their results on six benchmarks.</p><p>5 0.11725322 <a title="106-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Generating_Fine-Grained_Reviews_of_Songs_from_Album_Reviews.html">122 acl-2010-Generating Fine-Grained Reviews of Songs from Album Reviews</a></p>
<p>Author: Swati Tata ; Barbara Di Eugenio</p><p>Abstract: Music Recommendation Systems often recommend individual songs, as opposed to entire albums. The challenge is to generate reviews for each song, since only full album reviews are available on-line. We developed a summarizer that combines information extraction and generation techniques to produce summaries of reviews of individual songs. We present an intrinsic evaluation of the extraction components, and of the informativeness of the summaries; and a user study of the impact of the song review summaries on users’ decision making processes. Users were able to make quicker and more informed decisions when presented with the summary as compared to the full album review.</p><p>6 0.1104749 <a title="106-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Joint_Syntactic_and_Semantic_Parsing_of_Chinese.html">153 acl-2010-Joint Syntactic and Semantic Parsing of Chinese</a></p>

<p>Author: Xu Sun ; Jianfeng Gao ; Daniel Micol ; Chris Quirk</p><p>Abstract: This paper explores the use of clickthrough data for query spelling correction. First, large amounts of query-correction pairs are derived by analyzing users' query reformulation behavior encoded in the clickthrough data. Then, a phrase-based error model that accounts for the transformation probability between multi-term phrases is trained and integrated into a query speller system. Experiments are carried out on a human-labeled data set. Results show that the system using the phrase-based error model outperforms cantly its baseline systems. 1 signifi-</p><p>4 0.74607992 <a title="106-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Understanding_the_Semantic_Structure_of_Noun_Phrase_Queries.html">245 acl-2010-Understanding the Semantic Structure of Noun Phrase Queries</a></p>

Our proposed method is motivated by the observation that the more frequently two words cooccur in user records, the more related they are. First, we utilize user behaviors to generate candidate words. Then, we utilize search engine to enrich candidate words with adequate semantic features. Finally, we reorder candidate words according to their semantic relatedness to the seed word. Experimental results on a Chinese input method dataset show that our method gains better performance. 1</p><p>6 0.52761322 <a title="106-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-The_S-Space_Package%3A_An_Open_Source_Package_for_Word_Space_Models.html">232 acl-2010-The S-Space Package: An Open Source Package for Word Space Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Sebastian Spiegler ; Peter A. Flach</p><p>Abstract: This paper demonstrates that the use of ensemble methods and carefully calibrating the decision threshold can significantly improve the performance of machine learning methods for morphological word decomposition. We employ two algorithms which come from a family of generative probabilistic models. The models consider segment boundaries as hidden variables and include probabilities for letter transitions within segments. The advantage of this model family is that it can learn from small datasets and easily gen- eralises to larger datasets. The first algorithm PROMODES, which participated in the Morpho Challenge 2009 (an international competition for unsupervised morphological analysis) employs a lower order model whereas the second algorithm PROMODES-H is a novel development of the first using a higher order model. We present the mathematical description for both algorithms, conduct experiments on the morphologically rich language Zulu and compare characteristics of both algorithms based on the experimental results.</p><p>2 0.80603254 <a title="106-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-A_Taxonomy%2C_Dataset%2C_and_Classifier_for_Automatic_Noun_Compound_Interpretation.html">19 acl-2010-A Taxonomy, Dataset, and Classifier for Automatic Noun Compound Interpretation</a></p>

The problem is difficult, with disagreement regarding the number and nature of the relations, low inter-annotator agreement, and limited annotated data.

We build the HAL space directly from events to investigate whether processing costs can be reduced through more careful definition of word co-occurrence, and improve the quality of the pseudo-relevance feedback by applying event information as a constraint during HAL construction. Both methods significantly improve performance results in comparison with original HAL, and interpolation of HAL and relevance model expansion outperforms either method alone.</p><p>5 0.78429788 <a title="106-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Unsupervised_Ontology_Induction_from_Text.html">248 acl-2010-Unsupervised Ontology Induction from Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Hoifung Poon ; Pedro Domingos</p><p>Abstract: Extracting knowledge from unstructured text is a long-standing goal of NLP. Although learning approaches to many of its subtasks have been developed (e.g., parsing, taxonomy induction, information extraction), all end-to-end solutions to date require heavy supervision and/or manual engineering, limiting their scope and scalability. We present OntoUSP, a system that induces and populates a probabilistic ontology using only dependency-parsed text as input. OntoUSP builds on the USP unsupervised semantic parser by jointly forming ISA and IS-PART hierarchies of lambda-form clusters. The ISA hierarchy allows more general knowledge to be learned, and the use of smoothing for parameter estimation. We evaluate On- toUSP by using it to extract a knowledge base from biomedical abstracts and answer questions. OntoUSP improves on the recall of USP by 47% and greatly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches.</p><p>6 0.67869198 <a title="106-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Improving_Arabic-to-English_Statistical_Machine_Translation_by_Reordering_Post-Verbal_Subjects_for_Alignment.html">145 acl-2010-Improving Arabic-to-English Statistical Machine Translation by Reordering Post-Verbal Subjects for Alignment</a></p>

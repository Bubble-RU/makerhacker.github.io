<p>Author: Baoxun Wang ; Xiaolong Wang ; Chengjie Sun ; Bingquan Liu ; Lin Sun</p><p>Abstract: Quantifying the semantic relevance between questions and their candidate answers is essential to answer detection in social media corpora. In this paper, a deep belief network is proposed to model the semantic relevance for question-answer pairs. Observing the textual similarity between the community-driven questionanswering (cQA) dataset and the forum dataset, we present a novel learning strategy to promote the performance of our method on the social community datasets without hand-annotating work.

<p>Author: Marie-Catherine de Marneffe ; Christopher D. Manning ; Christopher Potts</p><p>Abstract: Texts and dialogues often express information indirectly. For instance, speakers’ answers to yes/no questions do not always straightforwardly convey a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer. The intended reply is clear in some cases (Was it good? It was great!) but uncertain in others (Was it acceptable? It was unprecedented.). In this paper, we present methods for interpreting the answers to questions like these which involve scalar modifiers. We show how to ground scalar modifier meaning based on data collected from the Web. We learn scales between modifiers and infer the extent to which a given answer conveys ‘yes’ or ‘no’ . To evaluate the methods, we collected examples of question–answer pairs involving scalar modifiers from CNN transcripts and the Dialog Act corpus and use response distributions from Mechanical Turk workers to assess the degree to which each answer conveys ‘yes’ or ‘no’ . Our experimental results closely match the Turkers’ response data, demonstrating that meanings can be learned from Web data and that such meanings can drive pragmatic inference.</p><p>5 0.16618447 <a title="171-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-A_Risk_Minimization_Framework_for_Extractive_Speech_Summarization.html">14 acl-2010-A Risk Minimization Framework for Extractive Speech Summarization</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthias H. Heie ; Edward W. D. Whittaker ; Sadaoki Furui</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate that there is a strong correlation between the Question Answering (QA) accuracy and the log-likelihood of the answer typing component of our statistical QA model. We exploit this observation in a clustering algorithm which optimizes QA accuracy by maximizing the log-likelihood of a set of question-and-answer pairs. Experimental results show that we achieve better QA accuracy using the resulting clusters than by using manually derived clusters.</p><p>4 0.7372089 <a title="171-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-%22Was_It_Good%3F_It_Was_Provocative.%22_Learning_the_Meaning_of_Scalar_Adjectives.html">2 acl-2010-"Was It Good?

<p>Author: Fei Huang ; Alexander Yates</p><p>Abstract: Most supervised language processing systems show a significant drop-off in performance when they are tested on text that comes from a domain significantly different from the domain of the training data. Semantic role labeling techniques are typically trained on newswire text, and in tests their performance on fiction is as much as 19% worse than their performance on newswire text. We investigate techniques for building open-domain semantic role labeling systems that approach the ideal of a train-once, use-anywhere system. We leverage recently-developed techniques for learning representations of text using latent-variable language models, and extend these techniques to ones that provide the kinds of features that are useful for semantic role labeling. In experiments, our novel system reduces error by 16% relative to the previous state of the art on out-of-domain text.</p><p>4 0.58290356 <a title="171-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Discriminative_Modeling_of_Extraction_Sets_for_Machine_Translation.html">87 acl-2010-Discriminative Modeling of Extraction Sets for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: John DeNero ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We present a discriminative model that directly predicts which set ofphrasal translation rules should be extracted from a sentence pair. Our model scores extraction sets: nested collections of all the overlapping phrase pairs consistent with an underlying word alignment. Extraction set models provide two principle advantages over word-factored alignment models. First, we can incorporate features on phrase pairs, in addition to word links. Second, we can optimize for an extraction-based loss function that relates directly to the end task of generating translations. Our model gives improvements in alignment quality relative to state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised baselines, as well as providing up to a 1.4 improvement in BLEU score in Chinese-to-English translation experiments.</p><p>5 0.5743627 <a title="171-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-A_Risk_Minimization_Framework_for_Extractive_Speech_Summarization.html">14 acl-2010-A Risk Minimization Framework for Extractive Speech Summarization</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Prettenhofer ; Benno Stein</p><p>Abstract: We present a new approach to crosslanguage text classification that builds on structural correspondence learning, a recently proposed theory for domain adaptation. The approach uses unlabeled documents, along with a simple word translation oracle, in order to induce taskspecific, cross-lingual word correspondences. We report on analyses that reveal quantitative insights about the use of unlabeled data and the complexity of interlanguage correspondence modeling. We conduct experiments in the field of cross-language sentiment classification, employing English as source language, and German, French, and Japanese as target languages. The results are convincing; they demonstrate both the robustness and the competitiveness of the presented ideas.</p><p>3 0.29415888 <a title="80-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Bilingual_Lexicon_Generation_Using_Non-Aligned_Signatures.html">50 acl-2010-Bilingual Lexicon Generation Using Non-Aligned Signatures</a></p>
<p>Author: Daphna Shezaf ; Ari Rappoport</p><p>Abstract: Bilingual lexicons are fundamental resources. Modern automated lexicon generation methods usually require parallel corpora, which are not available for most language pairs. Lexicons can be generated using non-parallel corpora or a pivot language, but such lexicons are noisy. We present an algorithm for generating a high quality lexicon from a noisy one, which only requires an independent corpus for each language. Our algorithm introduces non-aligned signatures (NAS), a cross-lingual word context similarity score that avoids the over-constrained and inef- ficient nature of alignment-based methods. We use NAS to eliminate incorrect translations from the generated lexicon. We evaluate our method by improving the quality of noisy Spanish-Hebrew lexicons generated from two pivot English lexicons. Our algorithm substantially outperforms other lexicon generation methods.</p><p>4 0.16244777 <a title="80-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Cross-Language_Document_Summarization_Based_on_Machine_Translation_Quality_Prediction.html">77 acl-2010-Cross-Language Document Summarization Based on Machine Translation Quality Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaojun Wan ; Huiying Li ; Jianguo Xiao</p><p>Abstract: Cross-language document summarization is a task of producing a summary in one language for a document set in a different language. Existing methods simply use machine translation for document translation or summary translation. However, current machine translation services are far from satisfactory, which results in that the quality of the cross-language summary is usually very poor, both in readability and content. In this paper, we propose to consider the translation quality of each sentence in the English-to-Chinese cross-language summarization process. First, the translation quality of each English sentence in the document set is predicted with the SVM regression method, and then the quality score of each sentence is incorporated into the summarization process. Finally, the English sentences with high translation quality and high informativeness are selected and translated to form the Chinese summary. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed approach. 1</p><p>5 0.16100203 <a title="80-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Evaluating_Multilanguage-Comparability_of_Subjectivity_Analysis_Systems.html">105 acl-2010-Evaluating Multilanguage-Comparability of Subjectivity Analysis Systems</a></p>

<p>Author: Deyi Xiong ; Min Zhang ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: Automatic error detection is desired in the post-processing to improve machine translation quality. The previous work is largely based on confidence estimation using system-based features, such as word posterior probabilities calculated from Nbest lists or word lattices. We propose to incorporate two groups of linguistic features, which convey information from outside machine translation systems, into error detection: lexical and syntactic features. We use a maximum entropy classifier to predict translation errors by integrating word posterior probability feature and linguistic features. The experimental results show that 1) linguistic features alone outperform word posterior probability based confidence estimation in error detection; and 2) linguistic features can further provide complementary information when combined with word confidence scores, which collectively reduce the classification error rate by 18.52% and improve the F measure by 16.37%.</p><p>3 0.66504729 <a title="80-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Automatically_Generating_Annotator_Rationales_to_Improve_Sentiment_Classification.html">42 acl-2010-Automatically Generating Annotator Rationales to Improve Sentiment Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Ainur Yessenalina ; Yejin Choi ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: One ofthe central challenges in sentimentbased text categorization is that not every portion of a document is equally informative for inferring the overall sentiment of the document. Previous research has shown that enriching the sentiment labels with human annotators’ “rationales” can produce substantial improvements in categorization performance (Zaidan et al., 2007). We explore methods to automatically generate annotator rationales for document-level sentiment classification. Rather unexpectedly, we find the automatically generated rationales just as helpful as human rationales.</p><p>4 0.6442849 <a title="80-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Sentiment_Learning_on_Product_Reviews_via_Sentiment_Ontology_Tree.html">209 acl-2010-Sentiment Learning on Product Reviews via Sentiment Ontology Tree</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Wei ; Jon Atle Gulla</p><p>Abstract: Existing works on sentiment analysis on product reviews suffer from the following limitations: (1) The knowledge of hierarchical relationships of products attributes is not fully utilized. (2) Reviews or sentences mentioning several attributes associated with complicated sentiments are not dealt with very well. In this paper, we propose a novel HL-SOT approach to labeling a product’s attributes and their associated sentiments in product reviews by a Hierarchical Learning (HL) process with a defined Sentiment Ontology Tree (SOT). The empirical analysis against a humanlabeled data set demonstrates promising and reasonable performance of the proposed HL-SOT approach. While this paper is mainly on sentiment analysis on reviews of one product, our proposed HLSOT approach is easily generalized to labeling a mix of reviews of more than one products.</p><p>5 0.64409852 <a title="80-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Generating_Templates_of_Entity_Summaries_with_an_Entity-Aspect_Model_and_Pattern_Mining.html">125 acl-2010-Generating Templates of Entity Summaries with an Entity-Aspect Model and Pattern Mining</a></p>
<p>Author: Peng Li ; Jing Jiang ; Yinglin Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatic generation of summary templates from given collections of summary articles. This kind of summary templates can be useful in various applications. We first develop an entity-aspect LDA model to simultaneously cluster both sentences and words into aspects. We then apply frequent subtree pattern mining on the dependency parse trees of the clustered and labeled sentences to discover sentence patterns that well represent the aspects. Key features of our method include automatic grouping of semantically related sentence patterns and automatic identification of template slots that need to be filled in. We apply our method on five Wikipedia entity categories and compare our method with two baseline methods. Both quantitative evaluation based on human judgment and qualitative comparison demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our method.</p><p>6 0.6418556 <a title="80-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-SVD_and_Clustering_for_Unsupervised_POS_Tagging.html">205 acl-2010-SVD and Clustering for Unsupervised POS Tagging</a></p>

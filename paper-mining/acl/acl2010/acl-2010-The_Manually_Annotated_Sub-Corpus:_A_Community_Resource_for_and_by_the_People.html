</p><p>7 1 Introduction The need for corpora annotated for multiple phenomena across a variety of linguistic layers is keenly recognized in the computational linguistics community. [sent-9, score-0.185]
</p><p>8 Several multiply-annotated corpora exist, especially for Western European languages and for spoken data, but, interestingly, broadbased English language corpora with robust annotation for diverse linguistic phenomena are rela-  tively rare. [sent-10, score-0.153]

</p><p>11 The most well-known multiply-annotated and validated corpus of English is the one million word Wall Street Journal corpus known as the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. [sent-16, score-0.205]
</p><p>12 , 1993), which over the years has been fully or partially annotated for several phenomena over and above the original part-of-speech tagging and phrase structure annotation. [sent-17, score-0.092]
</p><p>13 The usability of these annotations is limited, however, by the fact  that many of them were produced by independent projects using their own tools and formats, making it difficult to combine them in order to study their inter-relations. [sent-18, score-0.381]
</p><p>14 , 2007) released a one million word English corpus of newswire, broadcast news, and broadcast conversation that is annotated for Penn Treebank syntax, PropBank predicate argument structures, coreference, and named entities. [sent-20, score-0.144]
</p><p>15 OntoNotes comes closest to providing a corpus with multiple layers of annotation that can be analyzed as a unit via its representation of the annotations in a “normal form”. [sent-21, score-0.427]
</p><p>16 However, like the Wall Street Journal corpus, OntoNotes is limited in the range of genres it includes. [sent-22, score-0.066]
</p><p>17 It is also limited to only those annotations that may be produced by members of the OntoNotes project. [sent-23, score-0.293]
</p><p>18 In addition, use of the data and annotations with software other than the OntoNotes database API is not necessarily straightforward. [sent-24, score-0.283]
</p><p>19 The greatest obstacle is the high cost of manual pro-  duction and validation of linguistic annotations. [sent-26, score-0.059]
</p><p>20 Furthermore, the production and annotation of corpora, even when they involve significant scientific research, often do not, per se, lead to publishable research results. [sent-27, score-0.081]
</p><p>21 , 2008) project has been established to address many of these obstacles to the creation of large-scale, robust, multiplyannotated corpora. [sent-32, score-0.074]
</p><p>22 The MASC project’s aim is to offset some of the high costs of producing high quality linguistic annotations via a distribution of effort, and to solve some of the usability problems for annotations produced at different sites by harmonizing their representation formats. [sent-34, score-0.602]
</p><p>23 The MASC project provides a resource that is significantly different from OntoNotes and similar corpora. [sent-35, score-0.109]
</p><p>24 It provides data from a much wider variety of genres than existing multiply-annotated corpora of English, and all of the data in the corpus are drawn from current American English so as to be most useful for NLP applications. [sent-36, score-0.173]
</p><p>25 Perhaps most importantly, the MASC project is committed to a fully open model of distribution, without restriction, for all data and annotations. [sent-37, score-0.157]
</p><p>26 It is also committed to incorporating diverse annotations contributed by the community, regardless of format, into the corpus. [sent-38, score-0.408]
</p><p>27 As such, MASC is the first large-scale, open, community-based effort to create a much-needed language resource for NLP. [sent-39, score-0.065]
</p><p>28 This paper describes the MASC project, its corpus  and annotations, and serves as a call for contributions of data and annotations from the language processing community. [sent-40, score-0.348]
</p><p>29 2  MASC: The Corpus  MASC is a balanced subset of 500K words of written texts and transcribed speech drawn primarily from the Open American National Corpus (OANC)1 . [sent-41, score-0.064]
</p><p>30 The OANC is a 15 million word (and growing) corpus of American English produced since 1990, all of which is in the public domain 1http://www. [sent-42, score-0.09]
</p><p>31 Where licensing permits, data for inclusion in MASC is drawn from sources that have already been heavily annotated by others. [sent-46, score-0.072]
</p><p>32 So far, the first 80K increment of MASC data includes a 40K subset consisting of OANC data that has been previously annotated for PropBank predicate argument structures, Pittsburgh Opinion annotation (opinions, evaluations, sentiments, etc. [sent-47, score-0.197]
</p><p>33 ), TimeML time and events2, and several other linguistic phenomena. [sent-48, score-0.03]
</p><p>34 It also includes a handful of small texts from the so-called Language Understanding (LU) Corpus3 that has been annotated by multiple groups for a wide variety of phenomena, including events and committed belief. [sent-49, score-0.208]
</p><p>35 All of the first 80K increment is annotated for Penn Treebank syntax. [sent-50, score-0.089]
</p><p>36 5K words of Wall Street Journal texts that have  been annotated by several projects, including Penn Treebank, PropBank, Penn Discourse Treebank, TimeML, and the Pittsburgh Opinion project. [sent-52, score-0.092]
</p><p>37 The composition of the 220K portion of the corpus annotated so far is shown in Table 1. [sent-53, score-0.078]
</p><p>38 The remaining 280K of the corpus fills out the genres that are under-represented in the first portion and includes a few additional genres such as blogs and tweets. [sent-54, score-0.187]
</p><p>39 3  MASC Annotations  Annotations for a variety of linguistic phenomena, either manually produced or corrected from output of automatic annotation systems, are being added 2The TimeML annotations of the data are not yet completed. [sent-55, score-0.481]
</p><p>40 3MASC contains about 2K words of the 10K LU corpus, eliminating non-English and translated LU texts as well as texts that are not free of usage and redistribution restrictions. [sent-56, score-0.114]
</p><p>41 To date, validated or manually produced annotations for 222K words have been made available. [sent-60, score-0.437]
</p><p>42 The MASC project is itself producing annotations for portions ofthe corpus for WordNet senses and FrameNet frames and frame elements. [sent-61, score-0.408]
</p><p>43 To derive maximal benefit from the semantic information provided by these resources, the entire corpus is also annotated and manually validated for shallow parses (noun and verb chunks) and named  entities (person, location, organization, date and time). [sent-62, score-0.242]
</p><p>44 Several additional types of annotation have either been contracted by the MASC project or contributed from other sources. [sent-63, score-0.247]
</p><p>45 The 220K words ofMASC I IIinclude seventeen different types and of linguistic annotation4, shown in Table 2. [sent-64, score-0.03]
</p><p>46 All MASC annotations, whether contributed or produced in-house, are transduced to the Graph Annotation Framework (GrAF) (Ide and Suderman, 2007) defined by ISO TC37 SC4’s Linguistic Annotation Framework (LAF) (Ide and Romary, 2004). [sent-65, score-0.128]
</p><p>47 GrAF is an XML serialization of the LAF abstract model of annotations, which consists of a directed graph decorated with feature structures providing the annotation content. [sent-66, score-0.112]
</p><p>48 GrAF’s primary role is to serve as a “pivot” format for transducing among annotations represented in different formats. [sent-67, score-0.408]
</p><p>49 However, because the underlying data structure is a graph, the GrAF representation itself can serve as the basis for analysis via application of 4This includes WordNet sense annotations, which are not listed in Table 2 because they are not applied to full texts; see Section 3.

</p><p>50 1 for a description of the WordNet sense annotations in MASC. [sent-69, score-0.295]
</p><p>51 The layering of annotations over MASC texts dictates the use of a stand-off annotation representation format, in which each annotation is contained in a separate document linked to the primary data. [sent-71, score-0.461]
</p><p>52 Each text in the corpus is provided in UTF-8 character encoding in a separate file, which includes no annotation or markup of any kind. [sent-72, score-0.136]
</p><p>53 Each file is associated with a set of GrAF standoff files, one for each annotation type, containing the annotations for that text. [sent-73, score-0.384]
</p><p>54 In addition to the annotation types listed in Table 2, a document containing annotation for logical structure (titles, headings, sections, etc. [sent-74, score-0.162]
</p><p>55 Contributed annotations  are also included in their original format, where available. [sent-77, score-0.257]
</p><p>56 1 WordNet Sense Annotations A focus of the MASC project is to provide corpus evidence to support an effort to harmonize sense distinctions in WordNet and FrameNet (Baker and Fellbaum, 2009), (Fellbaum and Baker, to appear). [sent-79, score-0.17]
</p><p>57 The WordNet and FrameNet teams have selected for this purpose 100 common polysemous words whose senses they will study in detail, and the MASC team is annotating occurrences of these words in the MASC. [sent-80, score-0.08]
</p><p>58 As a first step, fifty occurrences of each word are annotated using the WordNet 3. [sent-81, score-0.071]
</p><p>59 0 inventory and analyzed for problems in sense assignment, after which the WordNet team may make modifications to the inventory if needed. [sent-82, score-0.161]
</p><p>60 The revised inventory (which will be released as part of WordNet 3. [sent-83, score-0.028]
</p><p>61 Because of its small size, MASC typically contains less than 1000 occurrences of a given word; the remaining occurrences are therefore drawn from the 15 million  words of the OANC. [sent-85, score-0.09]
</p><p>62 Furthermore, the FrameNet team is also annotating one hundred of the 1000 sentences for each word with FrameNet frames and frame elements, providing direct comparisons of WordNet and FrameNet sense assignments in 70  attested sentences. [sent-86, score-0.126]
</p><p>63 5 For convenience, the annotated sentences are provided as a stand-alone corpus, with the WordNet and FrameNet annotations represented in standoff files. [sent-87, score-0.353]
</p><p>64 Each sentence in this corpus is linked to its occurrence in the original text, so that the context and other annotations associated with the sentence may be retrieved. [sent-88, score-0.285]
</p><p>65 2  Validation  Automatically-produced annotations for sentence, token, part of speech, shallow parses (noun and verb chunks), and named entities (person, location, organization, date and time) are handvalidated by a team of students. [sent-90, score-0.316]
</p><p>66 Each annotation  set is first corrected by one student, after which it is checked (and corrected where necessary) by a second student, and finally checked by both automatic extraction of the annotated data and a third pass over the annotations by a graduate student or senior researcher. [sent-91, score-0.472]
</p><p>67 Annotations produced by other projects and the FrameNet and Penn Treebank annotations produced specifically for MASC are semiautomatically and/or manually produced by those projects and subjected to their internal quality controls. [sent-93, score-0.446]
</p><p>68 The WordNet sense annotations are being used as a base for an extensive inter-annotator agreement study, which is described in detail in (Passonneau et al. [sent-95, score-0.295]
</p><p>69 All inter-annotator agreement data and statistics are published along with the sense tags. [sent-98, score-0.038]
</p><p>70 The release also includes documentation on the words  annotated in each round, the sense labels for each word, the sentences for each word, and the annotator or annotators for each sense assignment to each word in context. [sent-99, score-0.174]
</p><p>71 For the multiply annotated data in rounds 2-4, we include raw tables for each word in the form expected by Ron Artstein’s calculate alpha. [sent-100, score-0.05]
</p><p>72 5Note that several MASC texts have been fully annotated for FrameNet frames and frame elements, in addition to the WordNet-tagged sentences. [sent-102, score-0.141]
</p><p>73 In addition to enabling download of the entire MASC, we provide a web application that allows users to select some or all parts of the corpus and  choose among the available annotations via a web interface (Ide et al. [sent-108, score-0.285]

[sent-135, score-0.799]
</p><p>78 Because the GrAF format is isomorphic to input to many graph-analytic tools, existing graphanalytic software can also be exploited to search and manipulate MASC annotations. [sent-136, score-0.141]
</p><p>79 Trivial merging of GrAF-based annotations involves simply combining the graphs for each annotation, after which graph minimization algorithms15 can be applied to collapse nodes with edges to common subgraphs to identify commonly annotated components. [sent-137, score-0.338]

</p><p>83 —  6 Community Contributions The ANC project solicits contributions of annotations of any kind, applied to any part or all of the MASC data. [sent-141, score-0.37]
</p><p>84 Annotations may be contributed in any format, either inline or standoff. [sent-142, score-0.092]
</p><p>85 All contributed annotations are ported to GrAF standoff format so that they may be used with other MASC annotations and rendered in the various formats the ANC tools generate. [sent-143, score-0.888]
</p><p>86 To accomplish this, the ANC project has developed a suite ofinternal tools and methods for automatically transducing other annotation formats to GrAF and for rapid adaptation of previously unseen formats. [sent-144, score-0.294]
</p><p>87 The validity of annotations and supplemental documentation (if appropriate) are the responsibility of the contributor. [sent-148, score-0.278]

</p><p>89 Contributions of unvalidated annotations for MASC and OANC data are also welcomed and are distributed separately. [sent-158, score-0.257]
</p><p>90 Contributions of unencumbered texts in any genre, including stories, papers, student essays, poetry, blogs, and email, are also solicited via the ANC web site and the ANC FaceBook page18, and may be uploaded at the contribution page cited above. [sent-159, score-0.1]
</p><p>91 7  Conclusion  MASC is already the most richly annotated corpus of English available for widespread use. [sent-160, score-0.078]
</p><p>92 Because the MASC is an open resource that the community can continually enhance with additional annotations and modifications, the project serves as a model for community-wide resource development  in the future. [sent-161, score-0.477]
</p><p>93 Past experience with corpora such as the Wall Street Journal shows that the community is eager to annotate available language data, and we anticipate even greater interest in MASC, which includes language data covering a range of genres that no existing resource provides. [sent-162, score-0.156]
</p><p>94 Therefore, we expect that as MASC evolves, more and more annotations will be contributed, thus creating a massive, inter-linked linguistic infrastructure for the study and processing of current American English in its many genres and varieties. [sent-163, score-0.385]
</p><p>95 In addition, by virtue of its WordNet and FrameNet annotations, MASC will be linked to parallel WordNets and FrameNets in languages other than English, thus creating a global resource for multi-lingual technologies, including machine translation. [sent-164, score-0.035]

The focal data types, bilingual texts and lexicons, relate each language to one of a set of reference languages. We propose that the ability to train systems to translate into and out of a given language be the yardstick for determining when we have successfully captured a language.

<p>Author: Nancy Ide ; Collin Baker ; Christiane Fellbaum ; Rebecca Passonneau</p><p>Abstract: The Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC) project provides data and annotations to serve as the base for a communitywide annotation effort of a subset of the American National Corpus. The MASC infrastructure enables the incorporation of contributed annotations into a single, usable format that can then be analyzed as it is or ported to any of a variety of other formats. MASC includes data from a much wider variety of genres than existing multiply-annotated corpora of English, and the project is committed to a fully open model of distribution, without restriction, for all data and annotations produced or contributed. As such, MASC is the first large-scale, open, communitybased effort to create much needed language resources for NLP.

<p>Author: Erhard Hinrichs ; Marie Hinrichs ; Thomas Zastrow</p><p>Abstract: This software demonstration presents WebLicht (short for: Web-Based Linguistic Chaining Tool), a webbased service environment for the integration and use of language resources and tools (LRT). WebLicht is being developed as part of the D-SPIN project1. WebLicht is implemented as a web application so that there is no need for users to install any software on their own computers or to concern themselves with the technical details involved in building tool chains. The integrated web services are part of a prototypical infrastructure that was developed to facilitate chaining of LRT services. WebLicht allows the integration and use of distributed web services with standardized APIs. The nature of these open and standardized APIs makes it possible to access the web services from nearly any programming language, shell script or workflow engine (UIMA, Gate etc.) Additionally, an application for integration of additional services is available, allowing anyone to contribute his own web service. 1</p><p>4 0.68086386 <a title="230-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-A_Cognitive_Cost_Model_of_Annotations_Based_on_Eye-Tracking_Data.html">4 acl-2010-A Cognitive Cost Model of Annotations Based on Eye-Tracking Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Steven Abney ; Steven Bird</p><p>Abstract: We present a grand challenge to build a corpus that will include all of the world’s languages, in a consistent structure that permits large-scale cross-linguistic processing, enabling the study of universal linguistics. The focal data types, bilingual texts and lexicons, relate each language to one of a set of reference languages. We propose that the ability to train systems to translate into and out of a given language be the yardstick for determining when we have successfully captured a language. We call on the computational linguistics community to begin work on this Universal Corpus, pursuing the many strands of activity described here, as their contribution to the global effort to document the world’s linguistic heritage before more languages fall silent.</p><p>6 0.56539965 <a title="230-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Temporal_Information_Processing_of_a_New_Language%3A_Fast_Porting_with_Minimal_Resources.html">225 acl-2010-Temporal Information Processing of a New Language: Fast Porting with Minimal Resources</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Prettenhofer ; Benno Stein</p><p>Abstract: We present a new approach to crosslanguage text classification that builds on structural correspondence learning, a recently proposed theory for domain adaptation. The approach uses unlabeled documents, along with a simple word translation oracle, in order to induce taskspecific, cross-lingual word correspondences. We report on analyses that reveal quantitative insights about the use of unlabeled data and the complexity of interlanguage correspondence modeling. We conduct experiments in the field of cross-language sentiment classification, employing English as source language, and German, French, and Japanese as target languages. The results are convincing; they demonstrate both the robustness and the competitiveness of the presented ideas.</p><p>3 0.66417986 <a title="230-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Towards_Open-Domain_Semantic_Role_Labeling.html">238 acl-2010-Towards Open-Domain Semantic Role Labeling</a></p>

<p>Author: Hiroyuki Shindo ; Akinori Fujino ; Masaaki Nagata</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel framework for word alignment that incorporates synonym knowledge collected from monolingual linguistic resources in a bilingual probabilistic model. Synonym information is helpful for word alignment because we can expect a synonym to correspond to the same word in a different language. We design a generative model for word alignment that uses synonym information as a regularization term. The experimental results show that our proposed method significantly improves word alignment quality.</p><p>5 0.6524083 <a title="230-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-%22Ask_Not_What_Textual_Entailment_Can_Do_for_You...%22.html">1 acl-2010-"Ask Not What Textual Entailment Can Do for You..."</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark Sammons ; V.G.Vinod Vydiswaran ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: We challenge the NLP community to participate in a large-scale, distributed effort to design and build resources for developing and evaluating solutions to new and existing NLP tasks in the context of Recognizing Textual Entailment. We argue that the single global label with which RTE examples are annotated is insufficient to effectively evaluate RTE system performance; to promote research on smaller, related NLP tasks, we believe more detailed annotation and evaluation are needed, and that this effort will benefit not just RTE researchers, but the NLP community as a whole. We use insights from successful RTE systems to propose a model for identifying and annotating textual infer- ence phenomena in textual entailment examples, and we present the results of a pilot annotation study that show this model is feasible and the results immediately useful.</p><p>6 0.64626765 <a title="230-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Entity-Based_Local_Coherence_Modelling_Using_Topological_Fields.html">101 acl-2010-Entity-Based Local Coherence Modelling Using Topological Fields</a></p>

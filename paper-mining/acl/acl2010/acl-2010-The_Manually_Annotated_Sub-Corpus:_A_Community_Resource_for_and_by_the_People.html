<p>Author: Steven Abney ; Steven Bird</p><p>Abstract: We present a grand challenge to build a corpus that will include all of the world’s languages, in a consistent structure that permits large-scale cross-linguistic processing, enabling the study of universal linguistics. The focal data types, bilingual texts and lexicons, relate each language to one of a set of reference languages. We propose that the ability to train systems to translate into and out of a given language be the yardstick for determining when we have successfully captured a language. We call on the computational linguistics community to begin work on this Universal Corpus, pursuing the many strands of activity described here, as their contribution to the global effort to document the world’s linguistic heritage before more languages fall silent.</p><p>5 0.08390566 <a title="230-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Generating_Entailment_Rules_from_FrameNet.html">121 acl-2010-Generating Entailment Rules from FrameNet</a></p>

<p>Author: Erhard Hinrichs ; Marie Hinrichs ; Thomas Zastrow</p><p>Abstract: This software demonstration presents WebLicht (short for: Web-Based Linguistic Chaining Tool), a webbased service environment for the integration and use of language resources and tools (LRT). WebLicht is being developed as part of the D-SPIN project1. WebLicht is implemented as a web application so that there is no need for users to install any software on their own computers or to concern themselves with the technical details involved in building tool chains. The integrated web services are part of a prototypical infrastructure that was developed to facilitate chaining of LRT services. WebLicht allows the integration and use of distributed web services with standardized APIs. The nature of these open and standardized APIs makes it possible to access the web services from nearly any programming language, shell script or workflow engine (UIMA, Gate etc.) Additionally, an application for integration of additional services is available, allowing anyone to contribute his own web service. 1</p><p>5 0.64558357 <a title="230-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-A_Cognitive_Cost_Model_of_Annotations_Based_on_Eye-Tracking_Data.html">4 acl-2010-A Cognitive Cost Model of Annotations Based on Eye-Tracking Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhi Zhong ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: Word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems based on supervised learning achieved the best performance in SensEval and SemEval workshops. However, there are few publicly available open source WSD systems. This limits the use of WSD in other applications, especially for researchers whose research interests are not in WSD. In this paper, we present IMS, a supervised English all-words WSD system. The flexible framework of IMS allows users to integrate different preprocessing tools, additional features, and different classifiers. By default, we use linear support vector machines as the classifier with multiple knowledge-based features. In our implementation, IMS achieves state-of-the-art results on several SensEval and SemEval tasks.</p><p>2 0.97315419 <a title="230-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-An_Active_Learning_Approach_to_Finding_Related_Terms.html">27 acl-2010-An Active Learning Approach to Finding Related Terms</a></p>
<p>Author: David Vickrey ; Oscar Kipersztok ; Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel system that helps nonexperts find sets of similar words. The user begins by specifying one or more seed words. The system then iteratively suggests a series of candidate words, which the user can either accept or reject. Current techniques for this task typically bootstrap a classifier based on a fixed seed set. In contrast, our system involves the user throughout the labeling process, using active learning to intelligently explore the space of similar words. In particular, our system can take advantage of negative examples provided by the user. Our system combines multiple preexisting sources of similarity data (a standard thesaurus, WordNet, contextual similarity), enabling it to capture many types of similarity groups (“synonyms of crash,” “types of car,” etc.). We evaluate on a hand-labeled evaluation set; our system improves over a strong baseline by 36%.</p><p>3 0.95157313 <a title="230-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Sentence_and_Expression_Level_Annotation_of_Opinions_in_User-Generated_Discourse.html">208 acl-2010-Sentence and Expression Level Annotation of Opinions in User-Generated Discourse</a></p>

We present a two-level annotation scheme. In the first stage, the reviews are analyzed at the sentence level for (i) relevancy to a given topic, and (ii) expressing an evaluation about the topic. In the second stage, on-topic sentences containing evaluations about the topic are further investigated at the expression level for pinpointing the properties (semantic orientation, intensity), and the functional components of the evaluations (opinion terms, targets and holders). We discuss the annotation scheme, the inter-annotator agreement for different subtasks and our observations.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.93332106 <a title="230-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-The_Manually_Annotated_Sub-Corpus%3A_A_Community_Resource_for_and_by_the_People.html">230 acl-2010-The Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus: A Community Resource for and by the People</a></p>

<p>Author: Barbara McGillivray</p><p>Abstract: We present a system that automatically induces Selectional Preferences (SPs) for Latin verbs from two treebanks by using Latin WordNet. Our method overcomes some of the problems connected with data sparseness and the small size of the input corpora. We also suggest a way to evaluate the acquired SPs on unseen events extracted from other Latin corpora.</p><p>6 0.85403728 <a title="230-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Combining_Orthogonal_Monolingual_and_Multilingual_Sources_of_Evidence_for_All_Words_WSD.html">62 acl-2010-Combining Orthogonal Monolingual and Multilingual Sources of Evidence for All Words WSD</a></p>

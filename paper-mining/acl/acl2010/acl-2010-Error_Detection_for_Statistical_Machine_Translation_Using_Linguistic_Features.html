</p><p>6 A common approach to SMT error detection at the word level is calculating the confidence at which a word is correct. [sent-19, score-0.766]
</p><p>7 The majority of word confidence estimation methods follows three steps: 1) Calculate features that express the correctness of words either based on SMT model (e. [sent-20, score-0.511]

</p><p>10 It has already been proven effective in error detection for speech recognition (Shi and Zhou, 2005). [sent-43, score-0.454]
</p><p>11 However, it is not widely used in SMT error detection. [sent-44, score-0.254]
</p><p>12 The reason is probably that people have yet to find effective linguistic features that outperform nonlinguistic features such as word posterior probability features (Blatz et al. [sent-45, score-1.026]
</p><p>13 In this paper, we would like to show an effective use of linguistic features in SMT error detection. [sent-48, score-0.469]
</p><p>14 We integrate two sets of linguistic features into a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model and develop a MaxEnt-based binary classifier to predict the category (correct or incorrect) for each word in a generated target sentence. [sent-49, score-0.475]
</p><p>15 Our experimental results show that linguistic features substantially improve error detection and even outperform word posterior probability features. [sent-50, score-1.204]
</p><p>16 Further, they can produce additional improvements when combined  with word posterior probability features. [sent-51, score-0.505]
</p><p>17 In Section 2, we review the previous work on wordlevel confidence estimation which is used for error detection. [sent-53, score-0.531]
</p><p>18 In Section 3, we introduce our linguistic features as well as the word posterior probability feature. [sent-54, score-0.75]
</p><p>19 In Section 4, we elaborate our MaxEntbased error detection model which combine linguistic features and word posterior probability feature together. [sent-55, score-1.284]
</p><p>20 2  Related Work  In this section, we present an overview of confidence estimation (CE) for machine translation at the word level. [sent-58, score-0.522]
</p><p>21 As we are only interested in error detection, we focus on work that uses confidence estimation approaches to detect translation errors. [sent-59, score-0.682]
</p><p>22 Of course, confidence estimation is not limited to the application of error detection, it can also be  used in other scenarios, such as translation prediction in an interactive environment (Grandrabur and Foster, 2003) . [sent-60, score-0.653]
</p><p>23 (2003) investigate using neural networks and a naive Bayes classifier to combine various confidence features for confidence estimation at the word level as well as at the sentence level. [sent-62, score-0.726]
</p><p>24 The features they use for word level CE include word posterior probabilities estimated from N-best lists, features based on SMT models, semantic features extracted from WordNet as well as simple syntactic features, i. [sent-63, score-1.036]
</p><p>25 Among all these features, the word posterior probability is the most effective feature, which is much better than linguistic features such as semantic features, according to their final results. [sent-66, score-0.75]
</p><p>26 Ueffing and Ney (2007) exhaustively explore various word-level confidence measures to label each word in a generated translation hypothesis as correct or incorrect. [sent-67, score-0.636]
</p><p>27 All their measures are based on word posterior probabilities, which are estimated from 1) system output, such as  word lattices or N-best lists and 2) word or phrase translation table. [sent-68, score-0.836]
</p><p>28 Their experimental results show that word posterior probabilities directly estimated from phrase translation table are better than those from system output except for the Chinese-English language pair. [sent-69, score-0.676]
</p><p>29 (2007) adopt a smoothed naive Bayes model to combine different word posterior probability based confidence features which are estimated from N-best lists, similar to (Ueffing and Ney, 2007). [sent-71, score-0.901]
</p><p>30 (2009) study several confidence features based on mutual information between words and n-gram and backward n-gram language model for word-level and sentence-level CE. [sent-73, score-0.322]
</p><p>31 They also explore linguistic features using information from syntactic category, tense, gender and so on. [sent-74, score-0.286]
</p><p>32 Unfortunately, such linguistic features neither improve performance at the word level nor at the sentence level. [sent-75, score-0.309]
</p><p>33 •  •  We exploit various linguistic features and sWhoew e txhpalto they are asb l ein to produce larger iamndprovements than widely used system-related features such as word posterior probabilities. [sent-77, score-0.828]
</p><p>34 Yet another advantage of using linguistic features is that they are system-independent, which therefore can be used across different systems. [sent-79, score-0.245]
</p><p>35 We treat error detection as a complete binary rcelaatss eirfircoartio dnet problem. [sent-80, score-0.498]
</p><p>36 1 Most previous approaches make decisions based on a pretuned classification threshold τ as follows  class ={ cinorcor ercet,ct, Φot(hceorrwreiscet,θ) > τ  where Φ is a classifier or a confidence measure and θ is the parameter set of Φ. [sent-82, score-0.288]
</p><p>37 3  Features  We explore two sets of linguistic features for each word in a machine generated translation hypothesis. [sent-84, score-0.535]
</p><p>38 The first set of linguistic features are simple lexical features. [sent-85, score-0.245]
</p><p>39 The second set of linguistic features are syntactic features which are extracted from link grammar parse. [sent-86, score-0.552]
</p><p>40 To compare with the previously widely used features, we also investigate features based on word posterior probabilities. [sent-87, score-0.583]
</p><p>41 The basic idea of using these features is that words in rare patterns are more likely to be incorrect than words in frequently occurring patterns. [sent-93, score-0.24]
</p><p>42 2 Syntactic Features High-level linguistic knowledge such as syntactic information about a word is a very natural and promising indicator to decide whether this word is syntactically correct or not. [sent-96, score-0.35]
</p><p>43 The challenge of using syntactic knowledge for error detection is that machine-  generated hypotheses are rarely fully grammatical. [sent-105, score-0.622]
</p><p>44 They are mixed with grammatical and ungrammatical parts, which hence are not friendly to traditional parsers trained on grammatical sentences because ungrammatical parts of a machinegenerated sentence could lead to a parsing failure. [sent-106, score-0.214]
</p><p>45 We hence straightforwardly define a syntactic feature for a word w according to its links as follows  link(w) ={ nyoes, woth hearsw li sneks In Figure 1we show an example of a generated translation hypothesis with its link parse. [sent-117, score-0.627]
</p><p>46 3 Word Posterior Probability Features Our word posterior probability is calculated on Nbest list, which is first proposed by (Ueffing et al. [sent-123, score-0.533]
</p><p>47 The major work of calculating word posterior probabilities is to find the Levenshtein alignment (Levenshtein, 1966) between the  best hypothesis  e1  and its competing hypothesis  3Available at http://www. [sent-128, score-0.715]
</p><p>48 The word in the hypothesis en which ei1 is Levenshtein aligned to is denoted as ℓi (e1, en). [sent-135, score-0.24]
</p><p>49 The word posterior probability of ei1 is then calculated by summing up the probabilities over all hypotheses containing ei1 in a position which is Levenshtein aligned to ei1. [sent-136, score-0.688]
</p><p>50 pwpp(ei1) =∑en: ℓ∑i(e1N1,epn()=ene1i)p(en) To use the word posterio∑r probability in our error detection model, we need to make it discrete. [sent-137, score-0.608]
</p><p>51 We introduce a feature for a word w based on its word posterior probability as follows  dwpp(w) = ⌊−log(pwpp(w))/df⌋ where df is the discrete factor which can be set to 1, 0. [sent-138, score-0.649]
</p><p>52 Therefore a feature “dwpp = 2” represents that the logarithm of the word posterior probability is between -3 and -2;  ”  4  Error Detection with a Maximum Entropy Model  As mentioned before, we consider error detection as a binary classification task. [sent-144, score-1.123]
</p><p>53 To formalize this task, we use a feature vector ψ to represent a word w in question, and a binary variable c to indicate whether this word is correct or not. [sent-145, score-0.326]
</p><p>54 We collect features {wd, pos, link, dwpp} for each word among these {wwodrd,sp oans,dl icnokm,bdiwnep t}he fmor einactoh wtheo fde aamtuoren gvte hcetoser  ψ for w. [sent-147, score-0.202]

</p><p>56 p(c|ψ) =∑ec′xepx(p∑(∑iθi fθii(fci,(cψ′,))ψ)) where fi is a binary mode∑l feature defined on c and the feature vector ψ. [sent-153, score-0.204]
</p><p>57 The challenge of collecting training {inψstan}ces is that the correctness of a word in a generated translation hypothesis is not intuitively clear (Ueffing and Ney, 2007). [sent-157, score-0.417]
</p><p>58 5  SMT System  To obtain machine-generated translation hypotheses for our error detection, we use a state-of-the-art phrase-based machine translation system MOSES (Koehn et al. [sent-163, score-0.66]
</p><p>59 For minimum error rate tun-  ing (Och, 2003), we use NIST MT-02 as the development set for the translation task. [sent-175, score-0.455]
</p><p>60 In order to calculate word posterior probabilities, we generate 10,000 best lists for NIST MT-02/03/05 respectively. [sent-176, score-0.476]
</p><p>61 Starting with MaxEnt models with single linguistic feature or word posterior probability based feature, we incorporated additional features incrementally by combining features together. [sent-180, score-0.968]
</p><p>62 In doing so, we would like the experimental results not only to display the effectiveness of linguistic features for error detection but also to identify the additional contribution of each feature to the task. [sent-181, score-0.779]
</p><p>63 1 Data Corpus For the error detection task, we use the best translation hypotheses of NIST MT-02/05/03 generated by MOSES as our training, development, and test corpus respectively. [sent-183, score-0.74]

</p><p>65 To obtain the linkage information, we run the LG parser on all translation hypotheses. [sent-187, score-0.207]
</p><p>66 To determine the true class of a word in a generated translation hypothesis, we follow (Blatz et al. [sent-193, score-0.293]
</p><p>67 We tag a word as correct if it is aligned to itself in  the Levenshtein alignment between the hypothesis and the nearest reference translation that has minimum edit distance to the hypothesis among four reference translations. [sent-195, score-0.635]
</p><p>68 Figure 2 shows the Levenshtein alignment between a machine-generated hypothesis and its nearest reference translation. [sent-196, score-0.189]
</p><p>69 The “Class” row shows the label of each word according to the alignment, where “c” and “i” represent correct and incorrect respectively. [sent-197, score-0.24]
</p><p>70 In Figure 2, the two words “last year” in the hypothesis will be tagged as correct if we use the PER or Set metric since they do not consider the occurring positions of words. [sent-199, score-0.281]
</p><p>71 It is also stricter than normal WER metric which compares each hypothesis to all references, rather than the nearest reference. [sent-331, score-0.224]
</p><p>72 2 Evaluation Metrics To evaluate the overall performance of the error detection, we use the commonly used metric, classification error rate (CER) to evaluate our classi-  fiers. [sent-334, score-0.522]
</p><p>73 Hence the baseline CER in our experiments is equal to the ratio of correct words as these words are wrongly tagged as incorrect. [sent-337, score-0.208]
</p><p>74 We also use precision and recall on errors to evaluate the performance of error detection. [sent-338, score-0.263]
</p><p>75 Let ng be the number of words of which the true class is incorrect, nt be the number of words which are tagged as incorrect by classifiers, and nm be the number of words tagged as incorrect that are indeed translation errors. [sent-339, score-0.519]
</p><p>76 The precision Pre is the percentage of words correctly tagged as translation errors. [sent-340, score-0.221]
</p><p>77 3 Experimental Results Table 5 shows the performance of our experiments on the error detection task. [sent-344, score-0.454]
</p><p>78 To compare with previous work using word posterior probabilities for confidence estimation, we carried out experiments using wpp estimated from N-best lists with the classification threshold τ, which was optimized on our development set to minimize CER. [sent-345, score-0.84]
</p><p>79 27% is achieved over the baseline CER, which reconfirms the effectiveness of word posterior probabilities for error detection. [sent-347, score-0.705]
</p><p>80 We conducted three groups of experiments using the MaxEnt based error detection model with various feature combinations. [sent-348, score-0.569]
</p><p>81 55% relative improvement over the CER of word posterior probability thresholding. [sent-352, score-0.539]
</p><p>82 Using discrete word posterior probabilities as features in the MaxEnt based error detection model is marginally better than word posterior probability thresholding in terms of CER, but obtains a 13. [sent-353, score-1.678]

</p><p>86 The combination of lexical features improves both CER and precision over single lexical feature (wd, pos). [sent-368, score-0.218]
</p><p>87 The addition of syntactic feature link marginally undermines CER but improves recall by a lot. [sent-369, score-0.31]

</p><p>89 We added linguistic features incrementally into the feature pool. [sent-371, score-0.325]
</p><p>90 The first two groups of experiments show that linguistic features, individually (except for link) or by combination, are able to produce much better performance than word posterior probability features in both CER and F measure. [sent-374, score-0.785]
</p><p>91 The best combination of linguistic features achieves a relative improvement of 8. [sent-375, score-0.279]
</p><p>92 58% in CER and  F measure respectively over word posterior probability thresholding. [sent-377, score-0.505]
</p><p>93 The Table 5 also reveals how linguistic features improve error detection. [sent-378, score-0.469]
</p><p>94 This suggests that our error detection model can be learned from a rather small training set. [sent-386, score-0.454]

</p><p>96 7  Conclusions and Future Work  In this paper, we have presented a maximum entropy based approach to automatically detect errors in translation hypotheses generated by SMT 610  systems. [sent-390, score-0.406]
</p><p>97 We incorporate two sets of linguistic features together with word posterior probability based features into error detection. [sent-391, score-1.112]
</p><p>98 The extracted linguistic features are quite compact, which can be learned from a small train-  ing set. [sent-393, score-0.245]
</p><p>99 Therefore our approach can be used for other machine translation systems, such as rule-based or example-based system, which generally do not produce N-best lists. [sent-395, score-0.188]
</p><p>100 Future work in this direction involve detecting particular error types such as incorrect positions, inappropriate/unnecessary words (Elliott, 2006) and automatically correcting errors. [sent-396, score-0.356]

<p>Author: Tong Xiao ; Jingbo Zhu ; Muhua Zhu ; Huizhen Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a simple and effective method to address the issue of how to generate diversified translation systems from a single Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) engine for system combination. Our method is based on the framework of boosting. First, a sequence of weak translation systems is generated from a baseline system in an iterative manner. Then, a strong translation system is built from the ensemble of these weak translation systems. To adapt boosting to SMT system combination, several key components of the original boosting algorithms are redesigned in this work. We evaluate our method on Chinese-to-English Machine Translation (MT) tasks in three baseline systems, including a phrase-based system, a hierarchical phrasebased system and a syntax-based system. The experimental results on three NIST evaluation test sets show that our method leads to significant improvements in translation accuracy over the baseline systems. 1</p><p>3 0.18056455 <a title="102-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Balancing_User_Effort_and_Translation_Error_in_Interactive_Machine_Translation_via_Confidence_Measures.html">45 acl-2010-Balancing User Effort and Translation Error in Interactive Machine Translation via Confidence Measures</a></p>

If a small loss in translation quality can be tolerated for the sake of efficiency, user effort can be saved by interactively translating only those initial translations which the confidence measure classifies as incorrect. We apply confidence estimation as a way to achieve a balance between user effort savings and final translation error. Empirical results show that our proposal allows to obtain almost perfect translations while significantly reducing user effort.</p><p>4 0.1800935 <a title="102-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Active_Learning-Based_Elicitation_for_Semi-Supervised_Word_Alignment.html">24 acl-2010-Active Learning-Based Elicitation for Semi-Supervised Word Alignment</a></p>

Our experiments show that by active selection of uncertain and informative links, we reduce the overall manual effort involved in elicitation of alignment link data for training a semisupervised word aligner.</p><p>5 0.16829747 <a title="102-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Bridging_SMT_and_TM_with_Translation_Recommendation.html">56 acl-2010-Bridging SMT and TM with Translation Recommendation</a></p>

<p>Author: Deyi Xiong ; Min Zhang ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: Automatic error detection is desired in the post-processing to improve machine translation quality. The previous work is largely based on confidence estimation using system-based features, such as word posterior probabilities calculated from Nbest lists or word lattices. We propose to incorporate two groups of linguistic features, which convey information from outside machine translation systems, into error detection: lexical and syntactic features. We use a maximum entropy classifier to predict translation errors by integrating word posterior probability feature and linguistic features. The experimental results show that 1) linguistic features alone outperform word posterior probability based confidence estimation in error detection; and 2) linguistic features can further provide complementary information when combined with word confidence scores, which collectively reduce the classification error rate by 18.52% and improve the F measure by 16.37%.</p><p>2 0.85080862 <a title="102-lsi-2" href="./acl-2010-Bridging_SMT_and_TM_with_Translation_Recommendation.html">56 acl-2010-Bridging SMT and TM with Translation Recommendation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jesus Gonzalez Rubio ; Daniel Ortiz Martinez ; Francisco Casacuberta</p><p>Abstract: This work deals with the application of confidence measures within an interactivepredictive machine translation system in order to reduce human effort. If a small loss in translation quality can be tolerated for the sake of efficiency, user effort can be saved by interactively translating only those initial translations which the confidence measure classifies as incorrect. We apply confidence estimation as a way to achieve a balance between user effort savings and final translation error. Empirical results show that our proposal allows to obtain almost perfect translations while significantly reducing user effort.</p><p>4 0.73089314 <a title="102-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Boosting-Based_System_Combination_for_Machine_Translation.html">54 acl-2010-Boosting-Based System Combination for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Xiao ; Jingbo Zhu ; Muhua Zhu ; Huizhen Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a simple and effective method to address the issue of how to generate diversified translation systems from a single Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) engine for system combination. Our method is based on the framework of boosting. First, a sequence of weak translation systems is generated from a baseline system in an iterative manner. Then, a strong translation system is built from the ensemble of these weak translation systems. To adapt boosting to SMT system combination, several key components of the original boosting algorithms are redesigned in this work. We evaluate our method on Chinese-to-English Machine Translation (MT) tasks in three baseline systems, including a phrase-based system, a hierarchical phrasebased system and a syntax-based system. The experimental results on three NIST evaluation test sets show that our method leads to significant improvements in translation accuracy over the baseline systems. 1</p><p>5 0.6843999 <a title="102-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-TrustRank%3A_Inducing_Trust_in_Automatic_Translations_via_Ranking.html">244 acl-2010-TrustRank: Inducing Trust in Automatic Translations via Ranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Radu Soricut ; Abdessamad Echihabi</p><p>Abstract: The adoption ofMachine Translation technology for commercial applications is hampered by the lack of trust associated with machine-translated output. In this paper, we describe TrustRank, an MT system enhanced with a capability to rank the quality of translation outputs from good to bad. This enables the user to set a quality threshold, granting the user control over the quality of the translations. We quantify the gains we obtain in translation quality, and show that our solution works on a wide variety of domains and language pairs.</p><p>6 0.64381248 <a title="102-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Tackling_Sparse_Data_Issue_in_Machine_Translation_Evaluation.html">223 acl-2010-Tackling Sparse Data Issue in Machine Translation Evaluation</a></p>

Frame-based systems currently make use of the FrameNet database but fail to show suitable generalization capabilities in out-of-domain scenarios. In this paper, a state-of-art system for frame-based SRL is extended through the encapsulation of a distributional model of semantic similarity. The resulting argument classification model promotes a simpler feature space that limits the potential overfitting effects. The large scale empirical study here discussed confirms that state-of-art accuracy can be obtained for out-of-domain evaluations.</p><p>6 0.8259095 <a title="102-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-TrustRank%3A_Inducing_Trust_in_Automatic_Translations_via_Ranking.html">244 acl-2010-TrustRank: Inducing Trust in Automatic Translations via Ranking</a></p>

<p>Author: Tong Xiao ; Jingbo Zhu ; Muhua Zhu ; Huizhen Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a simple and effective method to address the issue of how to generate diversified translation systems from a single Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) engine for system combination. Our method is based on the framework of boosting. First, a sequence of weak translation systems is generated from a baseline system in an iterative manner. Then, a strong translation system is built from the ensemble of these weak translation systems. To adapt boosting to SMT system combination, several key components of the original boosting algorithms are redesigned in this work. We evaluate our method on Chinese-to-English Machine Translation (MT) tasks in three baseline systems, including a phrase-based system, a hierarchical phrasebased system and a syntax-based system. The experimental results on three NIST evaluation test sets show that our method leads to significant improvements in translation accuracy over the baseline systems. 1</p><p>3 0.20828247 <a title="102-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Active_Learning-Based_Elicitation_for_Semi-Supervised_Word_Alignment.html">24 acl-2010-Active Learning-Based Elicitation for Semi-Supervised Word Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Vamshi Ambati ; Stephan Vogel ; Jaime Carbonell</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised word alignment aims to improve the accuracy of automatic word alignment by incorporating full or partial manual alignments. Motivated by standard active learning query sampling frameworks like uncertainty-, margin- and query-by-committee sampling we propose multiple query strategies for the alignment link selection task. Our experiments show that by active selection of uncertain and informative links, we reduce the overall manual effort involved in elicitation of alignment link data for training a semisupervised word aligner.</p><p>4 0.20420395 <a title="102-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Balancing_User_Effort_and_Translation_Error_in_Interactive_Machine_Translation_via_Confidence_Measures.html">45 acl-2010-Balancing User Effort and Translation Error in Interactive Machine Translation via Confidence Measures</a></p>
<p>Author: Jesus Gonzalez Rubio ; Daniel Ortiz Martinez ; Francisco Casacuberta</p><p>Abstract: This work deals with the application of confidence measures within an interactivepredictive machine translation system in order to reduce human effort. If a small loss in translation quality can be tolerated for the sake of efficiency, user effort can be saved by interactively translating only those initial translations which the confidence measure classifies as incorrect. We apply confidence estimation as a way to achieve a balance between user effort savings and final translation error. Empirical results show that our proposal allows to obtain almost perfect translations while significantly reducing user effort.</p><p>5 0.16676603 <a title="102-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Bridging_SMT_and_TM_with_Translation_Recommendation.html">56 acl-2010-Bridging SMT and TM with Translation Recommendation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yifan He ; Yanjun Ma ; Josef van Genabith ; Andy Way</p><p>Abstract: We propose a translation recommendation framework to integrate Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) output with Translation Memory (TM) systems. The framework recommends SMT outputs to a TM user when it predicts that SMT outputs are more suitable for post-editing than the hits provided by the TM. We describe an implementation of this framework using an SVM binary classifier. We exploit methods to fine-tune the classifier and investigate a variety of features of different types. We rely on automatic MT evaluation metrics to approximate human judgements in our experiments. Experimental results show that our system can achieve 0.85 precision at 0.89 recall, excluding ex- act matches. Furthermore, it is possible for the end-user to achieve a desired balance between precision and recall by adjusting confidence levels.</p><p>6 0.14534368 <a title="102-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Training_Phrase_Translation_Models_with_Leaving-One-Out.html">240 acl-2010-Training Phrase Translation Models with Leaving-One-Out</a></p>

<p>Author: Radu Soricut ; Abdessamad Echihabi</p><p>Abstract: The adoption ofMachine Translation technology for commercial applications is hampered by the lack of trust associated with machine-translated output. In this paper, we describe TrustRank, an MT system enhanced with a capability to rank the quality of translation outputs from good to bad. This enables the user to set a quality threshold, granting the user control over the quality of the translations. We quantify the gains we obtain in translation quality, and show that our solution works on a wide variety of domains and language pairs.</p><p>6 0.67181343 <a title="102-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Tackling_Sparse_Data_Issue_in_Machine_Translation_Evaluation.html">223 acl-2010-Tackling Sparse Data Issue in Machine Translation Evaluation</a></p>

<p>Author: Bin Wei ; Christopher Pal</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of using an annotated corpus in English for the same natural language processing task in another language. While various machine translation systems are available, automated translation is still far from perfect. To minimize the noise introduced by translations, we propose to use only key ‘reliable” parts from the translations and apply structural correspondence learning (SCL) to find a low dimensional representation shared by the two languages. We perform experiments on an EnglishChinese sentiment classification task and compare our results with a previous cotraining approach. To alleviate the problem of data sparseness, we create extra pseudo-examples for SCL by making queries to a search engine. Experiments on real-world on-line review data demonstrate the two techniques can effectively improvetheperformancecomparedtoprevious work.</p><p>3 0.62716949 <a title="102-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Generating_Templates_of_Entity_Summaries_with_an_Entity-Aspect_Model_and_Pattern_Mining.html">125 acl-2010-Generating Templates of Entity Summaries with an Entity-Aspect Model and Pattern Mining</a></p>
<p>Author: Peng Li ; Jing Jiang ; Yinglin Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatic generation of summary templates from given collections of summary articles. This kind of summary templates can be useful in various applications. We first develop an entity-aspect LDA model to simultaneously cluster both sentences and words into aspects. We then apply frequent subtree pattern mining on the dependency parse trees of the clustered and labeled sentences to discover sentence patterns that well represent the aspects. Key features of our method include automatic grouping of semantically related sentence patterns and automatic identification of template slots that need to be filled in. We apply our method on five Wikipedia entity categories and compare our method with two baseline methods. Both quantitative evaluation based on human judgment and qualitative comparison demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our method.</p><p>4 0.61641514 <a title="102-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Blocked_Inference_in_Bayesian_Tree_Substitution_Grammars.html">53 acl-2010-Blocked Inference in Bayesian Tree Substitution Grammars</a></p>
<p>Author: Trevor Cohn ; Phil Blunsom</p><p>Abstract: Learning a tree substitution grammar is very challenging due to derivational ambiguity. Our recent approach used a Bayesian non-parametric model to induce good derivations from treebanked input (Cohn et al., 2009), biasing towards small grammars composed of small generalisable productions. In this paper we present a novel training method for the model using a blocked Metropolis-Hastings sampler in place of the previous method’s local Gibbs sampler. The blocked sampler makes considerably larger moves than the local sampler and consequently con- verges in less time. A core component of the algorithm is a grammar transformation which represents an infinite tree substitution grammar in a finite context free grammar. This enables efficient blocked inference for training and also improves the parsing algorithm. Both algorithms are shown to improve parsing accuracy.</p><p>5 0.61295533 <a title="102-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Discriminative_Modeling_of_Extraction_Sets_for_Machine_Translation.html">87 acl-2010-Discriminative Modeling of Extraction Sets for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: John DeNero ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We present a discriminative model that directly predicts which set ofphrasal translation rules should be extracted from a sentence pair. Our model scores extraction sets: nested collections of all the overlapping phrase pairs consistent with an underlying word alignment. Extraction set models provide two principle advantages over word-factored alignment models. First, we can incorporate features on phrase pairs, in addition to word links. Second, we can optimize for an extraction-based loss function that relates directly to the end task of generating translations. Our model gives improvements in alignment quality relative to state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised baselines, as well as providing up to a 1.4 improvement in BLEU score in Chinese-to-English translation experiments.</p><p>6 0.61268914 <a title="102-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Training_Phrase_Translation_Models_with_Leaving-One-Out.html">240 acl-2010-Training Phrase Translation Models with Leaving-One-Out</a></p>

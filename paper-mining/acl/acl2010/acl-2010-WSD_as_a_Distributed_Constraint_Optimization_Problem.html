<p>Author: Zhi Zhong ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: Word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems based on supervised learning achieved the best performance in SensEval and SemEval workshops. However, there are few publicly available open source WSD systems. This limits the use of WSD in other applications, especially for researchers whose research interests are not in WSD. In this paper, we present IMS, a supervised English all-words WSD system. The flexible framework of IMS allows users to integrate different preprocessing tools, additional features, and different classifiers. By default, we use linear support vector machines as the classifier with multiple knowledge-based features.

<p>Author: Linlin Li ; Benjamin Roth ; Caroline Sporleder</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic model for sense disambiguation which chooses the best sense based on the conditional probability of sense paraphrases given a context. We use a topic model to decompose this conditional probability into two conditional probabilities with latent variables. We propose three different instantiations of the model for solving sense disambiguation problems with different degrees of resource availability. The proposed models are tested on three different tasks: coarse-grained word sense disambiguation, fine-grained word sense disambiguation, and detection of literal vs. nonliteral usages of potentially idiomatic expressions. In all three cases, we outper- form state-of-the-art systems either quantitatively or statistically significantly.</p><p>4 0.17104493 <a title="257-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Combining_Orthogonal_Monolingual_and_Multilingual_Sources_of_Evidence_for_All_Words_WSD.html">62 acl-2010-Combining Orthogonal Monolingual and Multilingual Sources of Evidence for All Words WSD</a></p>

In this paper we present a system that combines evidence from a monolingual WSD system together with that from a multilingual WSD system to yield state of the art performance on standard All-Words data sets. The monolingual system is based on a modification ofthe graph based state ofthe art algorithm In-Degree. The multilingual system is an improvement over an AllWords unsupervised approach, SALAAM. SALAAM exploits multilingual evidence as a means of disambiguation. In this paper, we present modifications to both of the original approaches and then their combination.

In this paper, we present a methodology to automatically extend WordNet with large amounts of semantic relations from an encyclopedic resource, namely Wikipedia.

<p>Author: Mitesh Khapra ; Anup Kulkarni ; Saurabh Sohoney ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: In spite of decades of research on word sense disambiguation (WSD), all-words general purpose WSD has remained a distant goal. Many supervised WSD systems have been built, but the effort of creating the training corpus - annotated sense marked corpora - has always been a matter of concern. Therefore, attempts have been made to develop unsupervised and knowledge based techniques for WSD which do not need sense marked corpora. However such approaches have not proved effective, since they typically do not better Wordnet first sense baseline accuracy. Our research reported here proposes to stick to the supervised approach, but with far less demand on annotation. We show that if we have ANY sense marked corpora, be it from mixed domain or a specific domain, a small amount of annotation in ANY other domain can deliver the goods almost as if exhaustive sense marking were available in that domain. We have tested our approach across Tourism and Health domain corpora, using also the well known mixed domain SemCor corpus. Accuracy figures close to self domain training lend credence to the viability of our approach. Our contribution thus lies in finding a convenient middle ground between pure supervised and pure unsupervised WSD. Finally, our approach is not restricted to any specific set of target words, a departure from a commonly observed practice in domain specific WSD.</p><p>5 0.57251656 <a title="257-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Topic_Models_for_Word_Sense_Disambiguation_and_Token-Based_Idiom_Detection.html">237 acl-2010-Topic Models for Word Sense Disambiguation and Token-Based Idiom Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Jesus Gonzalez Rubio ; Daniel Ortiz Martinez ; Francisco Casacuberta</p><p>Abstract: This work deals with the application of confidence measures within an interactivepredictive machine translation system in order to reduce human effort. If a small loss in translation quality can be tolerated for the sake of efficiency, user effort can be saved by interactively translating only those initial translations which the confidence measure classifies as incorrect. We apply confidence estimation as a way to achieve a balance between user effort savings and final translation error. Empirical results show that our proposal allows to obtain almost perfect translations while significantly reducing user effort.</p><p>3 0.6164065 <a title="257-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Hierarchical_A%2A_Parsing_with_Bridge_Outside_Scores.html">131 acl-2010-Hierarchical A* Parsing with Bridge Outside Scores</a></p>
<p>Author: Adam Pauls ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Hierarchical A∗ (HA∗) uses of a hierarchy of coarse grammars to speed up parsing without sacrificing optimality. HA∗ prioritizes search in refined grammars using Viterbi outside costs computed in coarser grammars. We present Bridge Hierarchical A∗ (BHA∗), a modified Hierarchial A∗ algorithm which computes a novel outside cost called a bridge outside cost. These bridge costs mix finer outside scores with coarser inside scores, and thus constitute tighter heuristics than entirely coarse scores. We show that BHA∗ substantially outperforms HA∗ when the hierarchy contains only very coarse grammars, while achieving comparable performance on more refined hierarchies.</p><p>4 0.57075387 <a title="257-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Automatic_Selectional_Preference_Acquisition_for_Latin_Verbs.html">41 acl-2010-Automatic Selectional Preference Acquisition for Latin Verbs</a></p>

Experiments have shown effectiveness of many factors, including the Part of Speech tags in improving the grammaticality of the output. However, high quality part of speech taggers are not available in open domain for many languages. In this paper we used fixed length word suffix as a new factor in the Factored SMT, and were able to achieve significant improvements in three set of experiments: large NIST Arabic to English system, medium WMT Spanish to English system, and small TRANSTAC English to Iraqi system. 1</p><p>6 0.55995458 <a title="257-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-All_Words_Domain_Adapted_WSD%3A_Finding_a_Middle_Ground_between_Supervision_and_Unsupervision.html">26 acl-2010-All Words Domain Adapted WSD: Finding a Middle Ground between Supervision and Unsupervision</a></p>

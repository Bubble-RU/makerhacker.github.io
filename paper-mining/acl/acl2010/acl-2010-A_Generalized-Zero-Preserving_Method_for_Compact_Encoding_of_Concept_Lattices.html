<p>Author: Benjamin Van Durme ; Ashwin Lall</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by the recent interest in streaming algorithms for processing large text collections, we revisit the work of Ravichandran et al. (2005) on using the Locality Sensitive Hash (LSH) method of Charikar (2002) to enable fast, approximate comparisons of vector cosine similarity. For the common case of feature updates being additive over a data stream, we show that LSH signatures can be maintained online, without additional approximation error, and with lower memory requirements than when using the standard offline technique.</p><p>3 0.090427004 <a title="7-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Minimized_Models_and_Grammar-Informed_Initialization_for_Supertagging_with_Highly_Ambiguous_Lexicons.html">172 acl-2010-Minimized Models and Grammar-Informed Initialization for Supertagging with Highly Ambiguous Lexicons</a></p>
<p>Author: Sujith Ravi ; Jason Baldridge ; Kevin Knight</p><p>Abstract: We combine two complementary ideas for learning supertaggers from highly ambiguous lexicons: grammar-informed tag transitions and models minimized via integer programming. Each strategy on its own greatly improves performance over basic expectation-maximization training with a bitag Hidden Markov Model, which we show on the CCGbank and CCG-TUT corpora. The strategies provide further error reductions when combined. We describe a new two-stage integer programming strategy that efficiently deals with the high degree of ambiguity on these datasets while obtaining the full effect of model minimization.</p><p>4 0.088690028 <a title="7-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-A_Risk_Minimization_Framework_for_Extractive_Speech_Summarization.html">14 acl-2010-A Risk Minimization Framework for Extractive Speech Summarization</a></p>

<p>Author: Stefan Thater ; Hagen Furstenau ; Manfred Pinkal</p><p>Abstract: We present a syntactically enriched vector model that supports the computation of contextualized semantic representations in a quasi compositional fashion. It employs a systematic combination of first- and second-order context vectors. We apply our model to two different tasks and show that (i) it substantially outperforms previous work on a paraphrase ranking task, and (ii) achieves promising results on a wordsense similarity task; to our knowledge, it is the first time that an unsupervised method has been applied to this task.</p><p>6 0.076849714 <a title="7-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Metadata-Aware_Measures_for_Answer_Summarization_in_Community_Question_Answering.html">171 acl-2010-Metadata-Aware Measures for Answer Summarization in Community Question Answering</a></p>

<p>Author: Sylvain Schmitz</p><p>Abstract: Dominance links were introduced in grammars to model long distance scrambling phenomena, motivating the definition of multiset-valued linear indexed grammars (MLIGs) by Rambow (1994b), and inspiring quite a few recent formalisms. It turns out that MLIGs have since been rediscovered and reused in a variety of contexts, and that the complexity of their emptiness problem has become the key to several open questions in computer science. We survey complexity results and open issues on MLIGs and related formalisms, and provide new complexity bounds for some linguistically motivated restrictions.</p><p>3 0.64704448 <a title="7-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-Online_Generation_of_Locality_Sensitive_Hash_Signatures.html">183 acl-2010-Online Generation of Locality Sensitive Hash Signatures</a></p>

<p>Author: Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach to multilingual grammar induction that exploits a phylogeny-structured model of parameter drift. Our method does not require any translated texts or token-level alignments. Instead, the phylogenetic prior couples languages at a parameter level. Joint induction in the multilingual model substantially outperforms independent learning, with larger gains both from more articulated phylogenies and as well as from increasing numbers of languages. Across eight languages, the multilingual approach gives error reductions over the standard monolingual DMV averaging 21. 1% and reaching as high as 39%.</p><p>5 0.6552937 <a title="7-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Complexity_Metrics_in_an_Incremental_Right-Corner_Parser.html">65 acl-2010-Complexity Metrics in an Incremental Right-Corner Parser</a></p>
<p>Author: Stephen Wu ; Asaf Bachrach ; Carlos Cardenas ; William Schuler</p><p>Abstract: Hierarchical HMM (HHMM) parsers make promising cognitive models: while they use a bounded model of working memory and pursue incremental hypotheses in parallel, they still achieve parsing accuracies competitive with chart-based techniques. This paper aims to validate that a right-corner HHMM parser is also able to produce complexity metrics, which quantify a reader’s incremental difficulty in understanding a sentence. Besides defining standard metrics in the HHMM framework, a new metric, embedding difference, is also proposed, which tests the hypothesis that HHMM store elements represents syntactic working memory. Results show that HHMM surprisal outperforms all other evaluated metrics in predicting reading times, and that embedding difference makes a significant, independent contribution.</p><p>6 0.6547296 <a title="7-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Tree-Based_and_Forest-Based_Translation.html">243 acl-2010-Tree-Based and Forest-Based Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jason Riesa ; Daniel Marcu</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple yet powerful hierarchical search algorithm for automatic word alignment. Our algorithm induces a forest of alignments from which we can efficiently extract a ranked k-best list. We score a given alignment within the forest with a flexible, linear discriminative model incorporating hundreds of features, and trained on a relatively small amount of annotated data. We report results on Arabic-English word alignment and translation tasks. Our model outperforms a GIZA++ Model-4 baseline by 6.3 points in F-measure, yielding a 1.1 BLEU score increase over a state-of-the-art syntax-based machine translation system.</p><p>4 0.33752969 <a title="170-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Diversify_and_Combine%3A_Improving_Word_Alignment_for_Machine_Translation_on_Low-Resource_Languages.html">90 acl-2010-Diversify and Combine: Improving Word Alignment for Machine Translation on Low-Resource Languages</a></p>
<p>Author: Bing Xiang ; Yonggang Deng ; Bowen Zhou</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method to improve word alignment quality and eventually the translation performance by producing and combining complementary word alignments for low-resource languages. Instead of focusing on the improvement of a single set of word alignments, we generate multiple sets of diversified alignments based on different motivations, such as linguistic knowledge, morphology and heuristics. We demonstrate this approach on an English-to-Pashto translation task by combining the alignments obtained from syntactic reordering, stemming, and partial words.

<p>Author: John DeNero ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We present a discriminative model that directly predicts which set ofphrasal translation rules should be extracted from a sentence pair. Our model scores extraction sets: nested collections of all the overlapping phrase pairs consistent with an underlying word alignment. Extraction set models provide two principle advantages over word-factored alignment models. First, we can incorporate features on phrase pairs, in addition to word links. Second, we can optimize for an extraction-based loss function that relates directly to the end task of generating translations. Our model gives improvements in alignment quality relative to state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised baselines, as well as providing up to a 1.4 improvement in BLEU score in Chinese-to-English translation experiments.</p><p>6 0.21166633 <a title="170-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Improving_Statistical_Machine_Translation_with_Monolingual_Collocation.html">147 acl-2010-Improving Statistical Machine Translation with Monolingual Collocation</a></p>

Synonym information is helpful for word alignment because we can expect a synonym to correspond to the same word in a different language. We design a generative model for word alignment that uses synonym information as a regularization term. The experimental results show that our proposed method significantly improves word alignment quality.</p><p>6 0.79145682 <a title="170-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Discriminative_Modeling_of_Extraction_Sets_for_Machine_Translation.html">87 acl-2010-Discriminative Modeling of Extraction Sets for Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Simone Paolo Ponzetto ; Roberto Navigli</p><p>Abstract: One of the main obstacles to highperformance Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the knowledge acquisition bottleneck. In this paper, we present a methodology to automatically extend WordNet with large amounts of semantic relations from an encyclopedic resource, namely Wikipedia. We show that, when provided with a vast amount of high-quality semantic relations, simple knowledge-lean disambiguation algorithms compete with state-of-the-art supervised WSD systems in a coarse-grained all-words setting and outperform them on gold-standard domain-specific datasets.</p><p>3 0.6470117 <a title="170-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Training_Phrase_Translation_Models_with_Leaving-One-Out.html">240 acl-2010-Training Phrase Translation Models with Leaving-One-Out</a></p>
<p>Author: Joern Wuebker ; Arne Mauser ; Hermann Ney</p><p>Abstract: Several attempts have been made to learn phrase translation probabilities for phrasebased statistical machine translation that go beyond pure counting of phrases in word-aligned training data. Most approaches report problems with overfitting. We describe a novel leavingone-out approach to prevent over-fitting that allows us to train phrase models that show improved translation performance on the WMT08 Europarl German-English task. In contrast to most previous work where phrase models were trained separately from other models used in translation, we include all components such as single word lexica and reordering mod- els in training. Using this consistent training of phrase models we are able to achieve improvements of up to 1.4 points in BLEU. As a side effect, the phrase table size is reduced by more than 80%.</p><p>4 0.64679193 <a title="170-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Faster_Parsing_by_Supertagger_Adaptation.html">114 acl-2010-Faster Parsing by Supertagger Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan K. Kummerfeld ; Jessika Roesner ; Tim Dawborn ; James Haggerty ; James R. Curran ; Stephen Clark</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel self-training method for a parser which uses a lexicalised grammar and supertagger, focusing on increasing the speed of the parser rather than its accuracy. The idea is to train the supertagger on large amounts of parser output, so that the supertagger can learn to supply the supertags that the parser will eventually choose as part of the highestscoring derivation. Since the supertagger supplies fewer supertags overall, the parsing speed is increased. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method using a CCG supertagger and parser, obtain- ing significant speed increases on newspaper text with no loss in accuracy. We also show that the method can be used to adapt the CCG parser to new domains, obtaining accuracy and speed improvements for Wikipedia and biomedical text.</p><p>5 0.64523071 <a title="170-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-BabelNet%3A_Building_a_Very_Large_Multilingual_Semantic_Network.html">44 acl-2010-BabelNet: Building a Very Large Multilingual Semantic Network</a></p>

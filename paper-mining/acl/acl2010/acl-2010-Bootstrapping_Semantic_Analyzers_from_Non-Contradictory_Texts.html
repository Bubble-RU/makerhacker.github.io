</p><p>4 For example, when analyzing weather forecasts it is very hard to discover in an unsupervised way which of the expressions among “south wind”, “wind from west” and “southerly” denote the same wind direction and which are not, as they all have a very similar distribution of their contexts. [sent-15, score-0.746]
</p><p>5 In this paper, we show that groups of unannotated texts with overlapping and non-contradictory semantics provide a valuable source of information. [sent-17, score-0.546]
</p><p>6 We assume that each text in a group is independently generated from a full latent semantic state corresponding to the group. [sent-19, score-0.395]
</p><p>7 Importantly, the texts in each group do not have to be paraphrases of each other, as they  can verbalize only specific parts (aspects) of the full semantic state, yet statements about the same aspects must not contradict each other. [sent-20, score-0.494]
</p><p>8 Simultaneous inference of the semantic state for the noncontradictory and semantically overlapping documents would restrict the space of compatible hypotheses, and, intuitively, ‘easier’ texts in a group will help to analyze the ‘harder’ ones. [sent-21, score-0.764]

</p><p>10 However, it is important to note that the  phrase “wind from west” may still appear in the texts, but in reference to other time periods, underlying the need for modeling alignment between grouped texts and their latent meaning representation. [sent-34, score-0.485]
</p><p>11 As much of the human knowledge is redescribed multiple times, we believe that noncontradictory and semantically overlapping texts are often easy to obtain. [sent-35, score-0.348]
</p><p>12 Alternatively, if such groupings are not available, it may still be easier to give each semantic representation (or a state) to multiple annotators and ask each of them to provide a textual description, instead of annotating texts with semantic expressions. [sent-38, score-0.396]
</p><p>13 They investigate grounded language acquisition set-up and assume that semantics (world state) can be represented as a set of records each consisting of a set of fields. [sent-46, score-0.384]
</p><p>14 Their model segments text into utterances and identifies records, fields and field values discussed in each utter-  ance. [sent-47, score-0.449]
</p><p>15 For example, in the weather forecast domain field sky cover should get the same value given expressions “overcast” and “very cloudy” but a different one if the expres959  sions are “clear” or “sunny”. [sent-51, score-0.682]

</p><p>17 We follow their set-up, but assume that in-  stead of having access to the full semantic state for every training example, we have a very small amount of data annotated with semantic states and a larger number of unannotated texts with noncontradictory semantics. [sent-56, score-0.694]
</p><p>18 We study our set-up on the weather forecast data (Liang et al. [sent-57, score-0.436]

</p><p>26 In semantic parsing, we aim to find the most likely underlying semantics and alignment given the text:  ( mˆ , aˆ) = argmm,aaxP(a,w|m)P(m). [sent-82, score-0.379]
</p><p>27 Note th|awt the decision about mi is now conditioned on all the texts wj rather than only on wi. [sent-96, score-0.43]
</p><p>28 This conditioning is exactly what drives learning, as the information about likely semantics mj of text j affects the decision about choice of mi: P(mi|w1,. [sent-97, score-0.263]
</p><p>29 Note, that this probability is different from the probability that mi is actually verbalized in the text. [sent-112, score-0.306]

</p><p>31 An even simpler technique would be to parse texts in a random order conditioning each meaning mk? [sent-118, score-0.293]
</p><p>32 We propose a simple algorithm which aims to find an appropriate order of the greedy inference  ×  by estimating how well each candidate semantics mˆk would explain other texts and at each step selecting k (and mˆ k) which explains them best. [sent-124, score-0.437]
</p><p>33 Then it iteratively predicts meaning representations mˆ j conditioned on the list of semantics m? [sent-156, score-0.402]
</p><p>34 The algorithm selects a single meaning mˆ j which maximizes the probability of all the remaining texts and excludes the text j from future consideration (lines 6-7). [sent-163, score-0.345]

</p><p>37 An important aspect of this algorithm is that unlike usual greedy inference, the remaining (‘future’) texts do affect the choice of meaning rep-  resentations made on the earlier stages. [sent-170, score-0.293]
</p><p>38 In this paper, we use semantic structures as a pivot for finding the best alignment in the hope that presence of meaningful text alignments will improve the quality of the resulting semantic structures by enforcing a form of agreement between them. [sent-183, score-0.432]
</p><p>39 (2009) considered a scenario where each text was annotated with a world state, even though alignment between the text and the state was not observable. [sent-188, score-0.465]
</p><p>40 This is a weaker form of supervision than the one traditionally considered in supervised semantic parsing, where the alignment is also usually provided in training (Chen and Mooney, 2008; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005). [sent-189, score-0.375]
</p><p>41 Nevertheless, both in training and testing the world state is observable, and the alignment and the text are conditioned on the state during inference. [sent-190, score-0.527]
</p><p>42 As explained in the introduction, the world states s are represented by sets of records (see the block in the middle of figure 1 for an example of a world state). [sent-193, score-0.472]
</p><p>43 Each record is characterized by a record type t ∈ {1,. [sent-194, score-0.346]
</p><p>44 For example, there may be more than a single record of type wind speed, as they may refer to different time periods but all these records have the same set of fields, such as minimal, maximal and average wind speeds. [sent-199, score-0.742]
</p><p>45 We write = v to denote that n-th record of type t has field f set to value v. [sent-201, score-0.344]
</p><p>46 The probability of meaning mk then equals the probability of this assignment with other state variables left non-observable (and therefore marginalized out). [sent-203, score-0.368]

</p><p>65 When the world state is observable, learning does not require any approximations, as dynamic programming (a form of the forward-backward algorithm) can be used to infer the posterior distribution on the E-step (Liang et al. [sent-273, score-0.276]

</p><p>82 The test set consists of 150 texts, each corresponding to a different weather state. [sent-321, score-0.267]
</p><p>83 We aimed to preserve approximately the same proportion of new and original examples as we had in the training set, therefore, we combined 50 texts originally present in the weather dataset with additional 100 newly-produced texts. [sent-323, score-0.457]

<p>Author: Fei Huang ; Alexander Yates</p><p>Abstract: Most supervised language processing systems show a significant drop-off in performance when they are tested on text that comes from a domain significantly different from the domain of the training data. Semantic role labeling techniques are typically trained on newswire text, and in tests their performance on fiction is as much as 19% worse than their performance on newswire text. We investigate techniques for building open-domain semantic role labeling systems that approach the ideal of a train-once, use-anywhere system. We leverage recently-developed techniques for learning representations of text using latent-variable language models, and extend these techniques to ones that provide the kinds of features that are useful for semantic role labeling. In experiments, our novel system reduces error by 16% relative to the previous state of the art on out-of-domain text.</p><p>4 0.11481187 <a title="55-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Unsupervised_Discourse_Segmentation_of_Documents_with_Inherently_Parallel_Structure.html">246 acl-2010-Unsupervised Discourse Segmentation of Documents with Inherently Parallel Structure</a></p>
<p>Author: Minwoo Jeong ; Ivan Titov</p><p>Abstract: Documents often have inherently parallel structure: they may consist of a text and commentaries, or an abstract and a body, or parts presenting alternative views on the same problem.

<p>Author: Vamshi Ambati ; Stephan Vogel ; Jaime Carbonell</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised word alignment aims to improve the accuracy of automatic word alignment by incorporating full or partial manual alignments. Motivated by standard active learning query sampling frameworks like uncertainty-, margin- and query-by-committee sampling we propose multiple query strategies for the alignment link selection task. Our experiments show that by active selection of uncertain and informative links, we reduce the overall manual effort involved in elicitation of alignment link data for training a semisupervised word aligner.</p><p>6 0.10416067 <a title="55-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Discriminative_Modeling_of_Extraction_Sets_for_Machine_Translation.html">87 acl-2010-Discriminative Modeling of Extraction Sets for Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jackie Chi Kit Cheung ; Gerald Penn</p><p>Abstract: One goal of natural language generation is to produce coherent text that presents information in a logical order. In this paper, we show that topological fields, which model high-level clausal structure, are an important component of local coherence in German. First, we show in a sentence ordering experiment that topological field information improves the entity grid model of Barzilay and Lapata (2008) more than grammatical role and simple clausal order information do, particularly when manual annotations of this information are not available. Then, we incorporate the model enhanced with topological fields into a natural language generation system that generates constituent orders for German text, and show that the added coherence component improves performance slightly, though not statistically significantly.</p><p>4 0.55603427 <a title="55-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Unsupervised_Ontology_Induction_from_Text.html">248 acl-2010-Unsupervised Ontology Induction from Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Hoifung Poon ; Pedro Domingos</p><p>Abstract: Extracting knowledge from unstructured text is a long-standing goal of NLP. Although learning approaches to many of its subtasks have been developed (e.g., parsing, taxonomy induction, information extraction), all end-to-end solutions to date require heavy supervision and/or manual engineering, limiting their scope and scalability. We present OntoUSP, a system that induces and populates a probabilistic ontology using only dependency-parsed text as input. OntoUSP builds on the USP unsupervised semantic parser by jointly forming ISA and IS-PART hierarchies of lambda-form clusters. The ISA hierarchy allows more general knowledge to be learned, and the use of smoothing for parameter estimation. We evaluate On- toUSP by using it to extract a knowledge base from biomedical abstracts and answer questions. OntoUSP improves on the recall of USP by 47% and greatly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches.</p><p>5 0.54612845 <a title="55-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Word_Representations%3A_A_Simple_and_General_Method_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">263 acl-2010-Word Representations: A Simple and General Method for Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Joseph Turian ; Lev-Arie Ratinov ; Yoshua Bengio</p><p>Abstract: If we take an existing supervised NLP system, a simple and general way to improve accuracy is to use unsupervised word representations as extra word features. We evaluate Brown clusters, Collobert and Weston (2008) embeddings, and HLBL (Mnih & Hinton, 2009) embeddings of words on both NER and chunking. We use near state-of-the-art supervised baselines, and find that each of the three word representations improves the accuracy of these baselines. We find further improvements by combining different word representations.

<p>Author: Federico Sangati</p><p>Abstract: We present a probabilistic model extension to the Tesni `ere Dependency Structure (TDS) framework formulated in (Sangati and Mazza, 2009). This representation incorporates aspects from both constituency and dependency theory. In addition, it makes use of junction structures to handle coordination constructions. We test our model on parsing the English Penn WSJ treebank using a re-ranking framework. This technique allows us to efficiently test our model without needing a specialized parser, and to use the standard evaluation metric on the original Phrase Structure version of the treebank. We obtain encouraging results: we achieve a small improvement over state-of-the-art results when re-ranking a small number of candidate structures, on all the evaluation metrics except for chunking.</p><p>2 0.87271011 <a title="55-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Simple_Semi-Supervised_Training_of_Part-Of-Speech_Taggers.html">212 acl-2010-Simple Semi-Supervised Training of Part-Of-Speech Taggers</a></p>

In this work stacked learning is used to reduce tagging to a classification task. This simplifies semisupervised training considerably. Our prefered semi-supervised method combines tri-training (Li and Zhou, 2005) and disagreement-based co-training.

<p>Author: Francois Mairesse ; Milica Gasic ; Filip Jurcicek ; Simon Keizer ; Blaise Thomson ; Kai Yu ; Steve Young</p><p>Abstract: Most previous work on trainable language generation has focused on two paradigms: (a) using a statistical model to rank a set of generated utterances, or (b) using statistics to inform the generation decision process. Both approaches rely on the existence of a handcrafted generator, which limits their scalability to new domains. This paper presents BAGEL, a statistical language generator which uses dynamic Bayesian networks to learn from semantically-aligned data produced by 42 untrained annotators. A human evaluation shows that BAGEL can generate natural and informative utterances from unseen inputs in the information presentation domain. Additionally, generation perfor- mance on sparse datasets is improved significantly by using certainty-based active learning, yielding ratings close to the human gold standard with a fraction of the data.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.84235799 <a title="55-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Bootstrapping_Semantic_Analyzers_from_Non-Contradictory_Texts.html">55 acl-2010-Bootstrapping Semantic Analyzers from Non-Contradictory Texts</a></p>

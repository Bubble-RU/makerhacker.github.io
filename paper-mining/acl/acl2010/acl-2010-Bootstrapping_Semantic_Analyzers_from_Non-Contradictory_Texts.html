<p>Author: Jason Riesa ; Daniel Marcu</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple yet powerful hierarchical search algorithm for automatic word alignment. Our algorithm induces a forest of alignments from which we can efficiently extract a ranked k-best list. We score a given alignment within the forest with a flexible, linear discriminative model incorporating hundreds of features, and trained on a relatively small amount of annotated data. We report results on Arabic-English word alignment and translation tasks. Our model outperforms a GIZA++ Model-4 baseline by 6.3 points in F-measure, yielding a 1.1 BLEU score increase over a state-of-the-art syntax-based machine translation system.</p><p>3 0.15331514 <a title="55-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Active_Learning-Based_Elicitation_for_Semi-Supervised_Word_Alignment.html">24 acl-2010-Active Learning-Based Elicitation for Semi-Supervised Word Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Vamshi Ambati ; Stephan Vogel ; Jaime Carbonell</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised word alignment aims to improve the accuracy of automatic word alignment by incorporating full or partial manual alignments. Motivated by standard active learning query sampling frameworks like uncertainty-, margin- and query-by-committee sampling we propose multiple query strategies for the alignment link selection task. Our experiments show that by active selection of uncertain and informative links, we reduce the overall manual effort involved in elicitation of alignment link data for training a semisupervised word aligner.</p><p>4 0.13963607 <a title="55-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Semantic_Parsing%3A_The_Task%2C_the_State_of_the_Art_and_the_Future.html">206 acl-2010-Semantic Parsing: The Task, the State of the Art and the Future</a></p>

<p>Author: Minwoo Jeong ; Ivan Titov</p><p>Abstract: Documents often have inherently parallel structure: they may consist of a text and commentaries, or an abstract and a body, or parts presenting alternative views on the same problem. Revealing relations between the parts by jointly segmenting and predicting links between the segments, would help to visualize such documents and construct friendlier user interfaces. To address this problem, we propose an unsupervised Bayesian model for joint discourse segmentation and alignment. We apply our method to the “English as a second language” podcast dataset where each episode is composed of two parallel parts: a story and an explanatory lecture. The predicted topical links uncover hidden re- lations between the stories and the lectures. In this domain, our method achieves competitive results, rivaling those of a previously proposed supervised technique.</p><p>6 0.13099198 <a title="55-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-The_Human_Language_Project%3A_Building_a_Universal_Corpus_of_the_World%27s_Languages.html">226 acl-2010-The Human Language Project: Building a Universal Corpus of the World's Languages</a></p>

<p>Author: Yabin Zheng ; Zhiyuan Liu ; Lixing Xie</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by Google Sets, we study the problem of growing related words from a single seed word by leveraging user behaviors hiding in user records of Chinese input method. Our proposed method is motivated by the observation that the more frequently two words cooccur in user records, the more related they are. First, we utilize user behaviors to generate candidate words. Then, we utilize search engine to enrich candidate words with adequate semantic features. Finally, we reorder candidate words according to their semantic relatedness to the seed word. Experimental results on a Chinese input method dataset show that our method gains better performance. 1</p><p>4 0.59397775 <a title="55-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Word_Alignment_with_Synonym_Regularization.html">262 acl-2010-Word Alignment with Synonym Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Hiroyuki Shindo ; Akinori Fujino ; Masaaki Nagata</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel framework for word alignment that incorporates synonym knowledge collected from monolingual linguistic resources in a bilingual probabilistic model. Synonym information is helpful for word alignment because we can expect a synonym to correspond to the same word in a different language. We design a generative model for word alignment that uses synonym information as a regularization term. The experimental results show that our proposed method significantly improves word alignment quality.</p><p>5 0.57617879 <a title="55-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Plot_Induction_and_Evolutionary_Search_for_Story_Generation.html">196 acl-2010-Plot Induction and Evolutionary Search for Story Generation</a></p>
<p>Author: Neil McIntyre ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we develop a story generator that leverages knowledge inherent in corpora without requiring extensive manual involvement. A key feature in our approach is the reliance on a story planner which we acquire automatically by recording events, their participants, and their precedence relationships in a training corpus. Contrary to previous work our system does not follow a generate-and-rank architecture. Instead, we employ evolutionary search techniques to explore the space of possible stories which we argue are well suited to the story generation task. Experiments on generating simple children’s stories show that our system outperforms pre- vious data-driven approaches.</p><p>6 0.57080996 <a title="55-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-The_Human_Language_Project%3A_Building_a_Universal_Corpus_of_the_World%27s_Languages.html">226 acl-2010-The Human Language Project: Building a Universal Corpus of the World's Languages</a></p>

<p>Author: Nadir Durrani ; Hassan Sajjad ; Alexander Fraser ; Helmut Schmid</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to integrate transliteration into Hindi-to-Urdu statistical machine translation. We propose two probabilistic models, based on conditional and joint probability formulations, that are novel solutions to the problem. Our models consider both transliteration and translation when translating a particular Hindi word given the context whereas in previous work transliteration is only used for translating OOV (out-of-vocabulary) words. We use transliteration as a tool for disambiguation of Hindi homonyms which can be both translated or transliterated or transliterated differently based on different contexts. We obtain final BLEU scores of 19.35 (conditional prob- ability model) and 19.00 (joint probability model) as compared to 14.30 for a baseline phrase-based system and 16.25 for a system which transliterates OOV words in the baseline system. This indicates that transliteration is useful for more than only translating OOV words for language pairs like Hindi-Urdu.</p><p>2 0.87315023 <a title="55-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Generating_Fine-Grained_Reviews_of_Songs_from_Album_Reviews.html">122 acl-2010-Generating Fine-Grained Reviews of Songs from Album Reviews</a></p>
<p>Author: Swati Tata ; Barbara Di Eugenio</p><p>Abstract: Music Recommendation Systems often recommend individual songs, as opposed to entire albums. The challenge is to generate reviews for each song, since only full album reviews are available on-line. We developed a summarizer that combines information extraction and generation techniques to produce summaries of reviews of individual songs. We present an intrinsic evaluation of the extraction components, and of the informativeness of the summaries; and a user study of the impact of the song review summaries on users’ decision making processes. Users were able to make quicker and more informed decisions when presented with the summary as compared to the full album review.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.86099285 <a title="55-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Bootstrapping_Semantic_Analyzers_from_Non-Contradictory_Texts.html">55 acl-2010-Bootstrapping Semantic Analyzers from Non-Contradictory Texts</a></p>

<p>Author: Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach to multilingual grammar induction that exploits a phylogeny-structured model of parameter drift. Our method does not require any translated texts or token-level alignments. Instead, the phylogenetic prior couples languages at a parameter level. Joint induction in the multilingual model substantially outperforms independent learning, with larger gains both from more articulated phylogenies and as well as from increasing numbers of languages. Across eight languages, the multilingual approach gives error reductions over the standard monolingual DMV averaging 21. 1% and reaching as high as 39%.</p><p>5 0.79382211 <a title="55-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Discriminative_Modeling_of_Extraction_Sets_for_Machine_Translation.html">87 acl-2010-Discriminative Modeling of Extraction Sets for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: John DeNero ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We present a discriminative model that directly predicts which set ofphrasal translation rules should be extracted from a sentence pair. Our model scores extraction sets: nested collections of all the overlapping phrase pairs consistent with an underlying word alignment. Extraction set models provide two principle advantages over word-factored alignment models. First, we can incorporate features on phrase pairs, in addition to word links. Second, we can optimize for an extraction-based loss function that relates directly to the end task of generating translations. Our model gives improvements in alignment quality relative to state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised baselines, as well as providing up to a 1.4 improvement in BLEU score in Chinese-to-English translation experiments.</p><p>6 0.79377902 <a title="55-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Towards_Open-Domain_Semantic_Role_Labeling.html">238 acl-2010-Towards Open-Domain Semantic Role Labeling</a></p>

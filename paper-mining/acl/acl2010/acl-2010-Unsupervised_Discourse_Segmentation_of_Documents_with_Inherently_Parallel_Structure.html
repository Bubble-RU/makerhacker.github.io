<p>Author: Coskun Mermer ; Ahmet Afsin Akin</p><p>Abstract: We tackle the previously unaddressed problem of unsupervised determination of the optimal morphological segmentation for statistical machine translation (SMT) and propose a segmentation metric that takes into account both sides of the SMT training corpus. We formulate the objective function as the posterior probability of the training corpus according to a generative segmentation-translation model. We describe how the IBM Model-1 translation likelihood can be computed incrementally between adjacent segmentation states for efficient computation. Submerging the proposed segmentation method in a SMT task from morphologically-rich Turkish to English does not exhibit the expected improvement in translation BLEU scores and confirms the robustness of phrase-based SMT to translation unit combinatorics. A positive outcome of this work is the described modification to the sequential search algorithm of Morfessor (Creutz and Lagus, 2007) that enables arbitrary-fold parallelization of the computation, which unexpectedly improves the translation performance as measured by BLEU.</p><p>3 0.15319161 <a title="246-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Active_Learning-Based_Elicitation_for_Semi-Supervised_Word_Alignment.html">24 acl-2010-Active Learning-Based Elicitation for Semi-Supervised Word Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Vamshi Ambati ; Stephan Vogel ; Jaime Carbonell</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised word alignment aims to improve the accuracy of automatic word alignment by incorporating full or partial manual alignments. Motivated by standard active learning query sampling frameworks like uncertainty-, margin- and query-by-committee sampling we propose multiple query strategies for the alignment link selection task. Our experiments show that by active selection of uncertain and informative links, we reduce the overall manual effort involved in elicitation of alignment link data for training a semisupervised word aligner.</p><p>4 0.14647558 <a title="246-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Hierarchical_Search_for_Word_Alignment.html">133 acl-2010-Hierarchical Search for Word Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Riesa ; Daniel Marcu</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple yet powerful hierarchical search algorithm for automatic word alignment. Our algorithm induces a forest of alignments from which we can efficiently extract a ranked k-best list. We score a given alignment within the forest with a flexible, linear discriminative model incorporating hundreds of features, and trained on a relatively small amount of annotated data. We report results on Arabic-English word alignment and translation tasks. Our model outperforms a GIZA++ Model-4 baseline by 6.3 points in F-measure, yielding a 1.1 BLEU score increase over a state-of-the-art syntax-based machine translation system.</p><p>5 0.13813539 <a title="246-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Automatic_Evaluation_of_Linguistic_Quality_in_Multi-Document_Summarization.html">38 acl-2010-Automatic Evaluation of Linguistic Quality in Multi-Document Summarization</a></p>
<p>Author: Emily Pitler ; Annie Louis ; Ani Nenkova</p><p>Abstract: To date, few attempts have been made to develop and validate methods for automatic evaluation of linguistic quality in text summarization. We present the first systematic assessment of several diverse classes of metrics designed to capture various aspects of well-written text. We train and test linguistic quality models on consecutive years of NIST evaluation data in order to show the generality of results. For grammaticality, the best results come from a set of syntactic features. Focus, coherence and referential clarity are best evaluated by a class of features measuring local coherence on the basis of cosine similarity between sentences, coreference informa- tion, and summarization specific features. Our best results are 90% accuracy for pairwise comparisons of competing systems over a test set of several inputs and 70% for ranking summaries of a specific input.</p><p>6 0.13487959 <a title="246-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Discourse_Structure%3A_Theory%2C_Practice_and_Use.html">86 acl-2010-Discourse Structure: Theory, Practice and Use</a></p>

<p>Author: Ivan Titov ; Mikhail Kozhevnikov</p><p>Abstract: We argue that groups of unannotated texts with overlapping and non-contradictory semantics represent a valuable source of information for learning semantic representations. A simple and efficient inference method recursively induces joint semantic representations for each group and discovers correspondence between lexical entries and latent semantic concepts. We consider the generative semantics-text correspondence model (Liang et al., 2009) and demonstrate that exploiting the noncontradiction relation between texts leads to substantial improvements over natural baselines on a problem of analyzing human-written weather forecasts.</p><p>3 0.54372185 <a title="246-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-Unsupervised_Search_for_the_Optimal_Segmentation_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">249 acl-2010-Unsupervised Search for the Optimal Segmentation for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Neil McIntyre ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we develop a story generator that leverages knowledge inherent in corpora without requiring extensive manual involvement. A key feature in our approach is the reliance on a story planner which we acquire automatically by recording events, their participants, and their precedence relationships in a training corpus. Contrary to previous work our system does not follow a generate-and-rank architecture. Instead, we employ evolutionary search techniques to explore the space of possible stories which we argue are well suited to the story generation task. Experiments on generating simple children’s stories show that our system outperforms pre- vious data-driven approaches.</p><p>6 0.5106439 <a title="246-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Automatic_Sanskrit_Segmentizer_Using_Finite_State_Transducers.html">40 acl-2010-Automatic Sanskrit Segmentizer Using Finite State Transducers</a></p>

<p>Author: Weiwei Sun</p><p>Abstract: One deficiency of current shallow parsing based Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) methods is that syntactic chunks are too small to effectively group words. To partially resolve this problem, we propose semantics-driven shallow parsing, which takes into account both syntactic structures and predicate-argument structures. We also introduce several new “path” features to improve shallow parsing based SRL method. Experiments indicate that our new method obtains a significant improvement over the best reported Chinese SRL result.</p><p>3 0.6886549 <a title="246-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Learning_Better_Data_Representation_Using_Inference-Driven_Metric_Learning.html">161 acl-2010-Learning Better Data Representation Using Inference-Driven Metric Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: WenTing Wang ; Jian Su ; Chew Lim Tan</p><p>Abstract: Syntactic knowledge is important for discourse relation recognition. Yet only heuristically selected flat paths and 2-level production rules have been used to incorporate such information so far. In this paper we propose using tree kernel based approach to automatically mine the syntactic information from the parse trees for discourse analysis, applying kernel function to the tree structures directly. These structural syntactic features, together with other normal flat features are incorporated into our composite kernel to capture diverse knowledge for simultaneous discourse identification and classification for both explicit and implicit relations. The experiment shows tree kernel approach is able to give statistical significant improvements over flat syntactic path feature. We also illustrate that tree kernel approach covers more structure information than the production rules, which allows tree kernel to further incorporate information from a higher dimension space for possible better discrimination. Besides, we further propose to leverage on temporal ordering information to constrain the interpretation of discourse relation, which also demonstrate statistical significant improvements for discourse relation recognition on PDTB 2.0 for both explicit and implicit as well.

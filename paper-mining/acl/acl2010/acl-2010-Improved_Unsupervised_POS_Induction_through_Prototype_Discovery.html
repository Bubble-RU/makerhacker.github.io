<p>Author: Daria Bogdanova</p><p>Abstract: Various text mining algorithms require the process offeature selection. High-level semantically rich features, such as figurative language uses, speech errors etc., are very promising for such problems as e.g. writing style detection, but automatic extraction of such features is a big challenge. In this paper, we propose a framework for figurative language use detection. This framework is based on the idea of sense differentiation. We describe two algorithms illustrating the mentioned idea. We show then how these algorithms work by applying them to Russian language data.</p><p>4 0.17188106 <a title="144-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Fully_Unsupervised_Core-Adjunct_Argument_Classification.html">120 acl-2010-Fully Unsupervised Core-Adjunct Argument Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Omri Abend ; Ari Rappoport</p><p>Abstract: The core-adjunct argument distinction is a basic one in the theory of argument structure. The task of distinguishing between the two has strong relations to various basic NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing, semantic role labeling and subcategorization acquisition. This paper presents a novel unsupervised algorithm for the task that uses no supervised models, utilizing instead state-of-the-art syntactic induction algorithms. This is the first work to tackle this task in a fully unsupervised scenario.</p><p>5 0.15082127 <a title="144-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Syntax-to-Morphology_Mapping_in_Factored_Phrase-Based_Statistical_Machine_Translation_from_English_to_Turkish.html">221 acl-2010-Syntax-to-Morphology Mapping in Factored Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation from English to Turkish</a></p>
<p>Author: Reyyan Yeniterzi ; Kemal Oflazer</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel scheme to apply factored phrase-based SMT to a language pair with very disparate morphological structures. Our approach relies on syntactic analysis on the source side (English) and then encodes a wide variety of local and non-local syntactic structures as complex structural tags which appear as additional factors in the training data. On the target side (Turkish), we only perform morphological analysis and disambiguation but treat the complete complex morphological tag as a factor, instead of separating morphemes. We incrementally explore capturing various syntactic substructures as complex tags on the English side, and evaluate how our translations improve in BLEU scores. Our maximal set of source and target side transformations, coupled with some additional techniques, provide an 39% relative improvement from a baseline 17.08 to 23.78 BLEU, all averaged over 10 training and test sets. Now that the syntactic analysis on the English side is available, we also experiment with more long distance constituent reordering to bring the English constituent order close to Turkish, but find that these transformations do not provide any additional consistent tangible gains when averaged over the 10 sets.</p><p>6 0.15043713 <a title="144-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Efficient_Optimization_of_an_MDL-Inspired_Objective_Function_for_Unsupervised_Part-Of-Speech_Tagging.html">96 acl-2010-Efficient Optimization of an MDL-Inspired Objective Function for Unsupervised Part-Of-Speech Tagging</a></p>

<p>Author: Seth Kulick</p><p>Abstract: We describe an approach to simultaneous tokenization and part-of-speech tagging that is based on separating the closed and open-class items, and focusing on the likelihood of the possible stems of the openclass words.

<p>Author: Ashish Vaswani ; Adam Pauls ; David Chiang</p><p>Abstract: The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle is a method for model selection that trades off between the explanation of the data by the model and the complexity of the model itself. Inspired by the MDL principle, we develop an objective function for generative models that captures the description of the data by the model (log-likelihood) and the description of the model (model size). We also develop a efficient general search algorithm based on the MAP-EM framework to optimize this function. Since recent work has shown that minimizing the model size in a Hidden Markov Model for part-of-speech (POS) tagging leads to higher accuracies, we test our approach by applying it to this problem. The search algorithm involves a simple change to EM and achieves high POS tagging accuracies on both English and Italian data sets.</p><p>5 0.64296079 <a title="144-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Unsupervised_Ontology_Induction_from_Text.html">248 acl-2010-Unsupervised Ontology Induction from Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Hoifung Poon ; Pedro Domingos</p><p>Abstract: Extracting knowledge from unstructured text is a long-standing goal of NLP. Although learning approaches to many of its subtasks have been developed (e.g., parsing, taxonomy induction, information extraction), all end-to-end solutions to date require heavy supervision and/or manual engineering, limiting their scope and scalability. We present OntoUSP, a system that induces and populates a probabilistic ontology using only dependency-parsed text as input. OntoUSP builds on the USP unsupervised semantic parser by jointly forming ISA and IS-PART hierarchies of lambda-form clusters. The ISA hierarchy allows more general knowledge to be learned, and the use of smoothing for parameter estimation. We evaluate On- toUSP by using it to extract a knowledge base from biomedical abstracts and answer questions. OntoUSP improves on the recall of USP by 47% and greatly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches.</p><p>6 0.64177483 <a title="144-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Word_Representations%3A_A_Simple_and_General_Method_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">263 acl-2010-Word Representations: A Simple and General Method for Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Wei Wei ; Jon Atle Gulla</p><p>Abstract: Existing works on sentiment analysis on product reviews suffer from the following limitations: (1) The knowledge of hierarchical relationships of products attributes is not fully utilized. (2) Reviews or sentences mentioning several attributes associated with complicated sentiments are not dealt with very well. In this paper, we propose a novel HL-SOT approach to labeling a product‚Äôs attributes and their associated sentiments in product reviews by a Hierarchical Learning (HL) process with a defined Sentiment Ontology Tree (SOT). The empirical analysis against a humanlabeled data set demonstrates promising and reasonable performance of the proposed HL-SOT approach. While this paper is mainly on sentiment analysis on reviews of one product, our proposed HLSOT approach is easily generalized to labeling a mix of reviews of more than one products.</p><p>4 0.79530323 <a title="144-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Generating_Focused_Topic-Specific_Sentiment_Lexicons.html">123 acl-2010-Generating Focused Topic-Specific Sentiment Lexicons</a></p>

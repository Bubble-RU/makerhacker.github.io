<p>Author: Katrin Tomanek ; Udo Hahn ; Steffen Lohmann ; Jurgen Ziegler</p><p>Abstract: We report on an experiment to track complex decision points in linguistic metadata annotation where the decision behavior of annotators is observed with an eyetracking device. As experimental conditions we investigate different forms of textual context and linguistic complexity classes relative to syntax and semantics. Our data renders evidence that annotation performance depends on the semantic and syntactic complexity of the decision points and, more interestingly, indicates that fullscale context is mostly negligible with – the exception of semantic high-complexity cases. We then induce from this observational data a cognitively grounded cost model of linguistic meta-data annotations and compare it with existing non-cognitive models. Our data reveals that the cognitively founded model explains annotation costs (expressed in annotation time) more adequately than non-cognitive ones.</p><p>5 0.12107561 <a title="139-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Adapting_Self-Training_for_Semantic_Role_Labeling.html">25 acl-2010-Adapting Self-Training for Semantic Role Labeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Rasoul Samad Zadeh Kaljahi</p><p>Abstract: Supervised semantic role labeling (SRL) systems trained on hand-crafted annotated corpora have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, creating such corpora is tedious and costly, with the resulting corpora not sufficiently representative of the language. This paper describes a part of an ongoing work on applying bootstrapping methods to SRL to deal with this problem. Previous work shows that, due to the complexity of SRL, this task is not straight forward. One major difficulty is the propagation of classification noise into the successive iterations. We address this problem by employing balancing and preselection methods for self-training, as a bootstrapping algorithm. The proposed methods could achieve improvement over the base line, which do not use these methods. 1</p><p>6 0.11695497 <a title="139-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Automatic_Evaluation_of_Linguistic_Quality_in_Multi-Document_Summarization.html">38 acl-2010-Automatic Evaluation of Linguistic Quality in Multi-Document Summarization</a></p>

<p>Author: Stephen Tratz ; Eduard Hovy</p><p>Abstract: The automatic interpretation of noun-noun compounds is an important subproblem within many natural language processing applications and is an area of increasing interest. The problem is difficult, with disagreement regarding the number and nature of the relations, low inter-annotator agreement, and limited annotated data. In this paper, we present a novel taxonomy of relations that integrates previous relations, the largest publicly-available annotated dataset, and a supervised classification method for automatic noun compound interpretation.</p><p>3 0.70864576 <a title="139-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-Inducing_Domain-Specific_Semantic_Class_Taggers_from_%28Almost%29_Nothing.html">150 acl-2010-Inducing Domain-Specific Semantic Class Taggers from (Almost) Nothing</a></p>
<p>Author: Ruihong Huang ; Ellen Riloff</p><p>Abstract: This research explores the idea of inducing domain-specific semantic class taggers using only a domain-specific text collection and seed words. The learning process begins by inducing a classifier that only has access to contextual features, forcing it to generalize beyond the seeds. The contextual classifier then labels new instances, to expand and diversify the training set. Next, a cross-category bootstrapping process simultaneously trains a suite of classifiers for multiple semantic classes. The positive instances for one class are used as negative instances for the others in an iterative bootstrapping cycle. We also explore a one-semantic-class-per-discourse heuristic, and use the classifiers to dynam- ically create semantic features. We evaluate our approach by inducing six semantic taggers from a collection of veterinary medicine message board posts.</p><p>4 0.66886532 <a title="139-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Unsupervised_Event_Coreference_Resolution_with_Rich_Linguistic_Features.html">247 acl-2010-Unsupervised Event Coreference Resolution with Rich Linguistic Features</a></p>

Designed with the purpose of clustering complex linguistic objects, these models consider a potentially infinite number of features and categorical outcomes. The evaluation performed for solving both within- and cross-document event coreference shows significant improvements of the models when compared against two baselines for this task.</p><p>5 0.66209751 <a title="139-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-The_Same-Head_Heuristic_for_Coreference.html">233 acl-2010-The Same-Head Heuristic for Coreference</a></p>

<p>Author: Shasha Li ; Chin-Yew Lin ; Young-In Song ; Zhoujun Li</p><p>Abstract: Comparing one thing with another is a typical part of human decision making process. However, it is not always easy to know what to compare and what are the alternatives. To address this difficulty, we present a novel way to automatically mine comparable entities from comparative questions that users posted online. To ensure high precision and high recall, we develop a weakly-supervised bootstrapping method for comparative question identification and comparable entity extraction by leveraging a large online question archive. The experimental results show our method achieves F1measure of 82.5% in comparative question identification and 83.3% in comparable entity extraction. Both significantly outperform an existing state-of-the-art method. 1</p><p>2 0.9831658 <a title="139-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-A_Framework_for_Figurative_Language_Detection_Based_on_Sense_Differentiation.html">5 acl-2010-A Framework for Figurative Language Detection Based on Sense Differentiation</a></p>
<p>Author: Daria Bogdanova</p><p>Abstract: Various text mining algorithms require the process offeature selection. High-level semantically rich features, such as figurative language uses, speech errors etc., are very promising for such problems as e.g. writing style detection, but automatic extraction of such features is a big challenge. In this paper, we propose a framework for figurative language use detection. This framework is based on the idea of sense differentiation. We describe two algorithms illustrating the mentioned idea. We show then how these algorithms work by applying them to Russian language data.</p><p>3 0.95438308 <a title="139-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-WebLicht%3A_Web-Based_LRT_Services_for_German.html">259 acl-2010-WebLicht: Web-Based LRT Services for German</a></p>
<p>Author: Erhard Hinrichs ; Marie Hinrichs ; Thomas Zastrow</p><p>Abstract: This software demonstration presents WebLicht (short for: Web-Based Linguistic Chaining Tool), a webbased service environment for the integration and use of language resources and tools (LRT). WebLicht is being developed as part of the D-SPIN project1. WebLicht is implemented as a web application so that there is no need for users to install any software on their own computers or to concern themselves with the technical details involved in building tool chains. The integrated web services are part of a prototypical infrastructure that was developed to facilitate chaining of LRT services. WebLicht allows the integration and use of distributed web services with standardized APIs. The nature of these open and standardized APIs makes it possible to access the web services from nearly any programming language, shell script or workflow engine (UIMA, Gate etc.) Additionally, an application for integration of additional services is available, allowing anyone to contribute his own web service. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.93622082 <a title="139-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Identifying_Generic_Noun_Phrases.html">139 acl-2010-Identifying Generic Noun Phrases</a></p>

<p>Author: Carlos Gomez-Rodriguez ; Joakim Nivre</p><p>Abstract: Finding a class of structures that is rich enough for adequate linguistic representation yet restricted enough for efficient computational processing is an important problem for dependency parsing. In this paper, we present a transition system for 2-planar dependency trees trees that can be decomposed into at most two planar graphs and show that it can be used to implement a classifier-based parser that runs in linear time and outperforms a stateof-the-art transition-based parser on four data sets from the CoNLL-X shared task. In addition, we present an efficient method – – for determining whether an arbitrary tree is 2-planar and show that 99% or more of the trees in existing treebanks are 2-planar.</p><p>6 0.80744785 <a title="139-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Untangling_the_Cross-Lingual_Link_Structure_of_Wikipedia.html">250 acl-2010-Untangling the Cross-Lingual Link Structure of Wikipedia</a></p>

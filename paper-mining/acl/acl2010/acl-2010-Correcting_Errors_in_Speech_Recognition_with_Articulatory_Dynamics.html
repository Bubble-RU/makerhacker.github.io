</p><p>2 Abstract We introduce a novel mechanism for incorporating articulatory dynamics into speech recognition with the theory of task dynamics. [sent-2, score-0.859]
</p><p>3 This system reranks sentencelevel hypotheses by the likelihoods of their hypothetical articulatory realizations which are derived from relationships learned with aligned acoustic/articulatory data. [sent-3, score-0.651]
</p><p>4 Experiments compare this with two baseline systems, namely an acoustic hidden Markov model and a dynamic Bayes network augmented with discretized representations of the vocal tract. [sent-4, score-0.492]
</p><p>5 The result is that speech is treated as a surface acoustic phenomenon with lexical or phonetic hidden dynamics but without any physical constraints in between. [sent-8, score-0.537]
</p><p>6 Many acoustic ambiguities can be resolved with knowledge of the vocal tract’s configuration (O’Shaughnessy, 2000). [sent-11, score-0.353]
</p><p>7 Having access to the articulatory goals of the speaker would, in theory, make the identification of linguistic intent almost trivial. [sent-16, score-0.62]
</p><p>8 Although we don’t typically have access to the vocal tract during speech recognition, its configuration can be estimated reasonably well from acoustics alone within adequate models or measurements of the vocal tract (Richmond et al. [sent-17, score-1.245]
</p><p>9 Evidence that such inversion takes place naturally in humans during speech perception suggests that the discriminability of speech sounds depends powerfully on their production (Liberman and Mattingly, 1985; D’Ausilio et al. [sent-20, score-0.273]

</p><p>12 1 Articulatory phonology Articulatory phonology bridges the divide between the physical manifestation of speech and its  underlying lexical intentions. [sent-33, score-0.254]
</p><p>13 Within this discipline, the theory of task dynamics is a combined model of physical articulator motion and the planning of abstract vocal tract configurations (Saltzman, 1986). [sent-34, score-0.772]
</p><p>14 This theory introduces the notion that all observed patterns of speech are the result of overlapping gestures, which are abstracted goaloriented reconfigurations of the vocal tract, such as bilabial closure or velar opening (Saltzman and Munhall, 1989). [sent-35, score-0.334]
</p><p>15 The presence of these discrete goals influences the vocal tract dynamically and continuously as modelled by the following non-homogeneous second-order linear differential equation: Mz00+Bz0+K(z−z∗)  = 0. [sent-43, score-0.599]
</p><p>16 (1)  1Constriction locations generally refer to the front-back dimension of the vocal tract and constriction degrees generally refer to the top-down dimension. [sent-44, score-0.585]
</p><p>17 Here, z is a continuous vector representing the instantaneous positions of the nine tract variables, z∗ is the target (equilibrium) positions of those variables, and vectors z0 and z00 represent the first and second derivatives of z with respect to time (i. [sent-45, score-0.51]
</p><p>18 Generally, this theory assumes that the tract variables are mutually independent, and that the system is critically damped (i. [sent-49, score-0.408]
</p><p>19 , the tract variables do not oscillate around their equilibrium positions) (Nam and Saltzman, 2003). [sent-51, score-0.408]
</p><p>20 2 Articulatory data Tract variables provide the dimensions of an abstract gestural space independent of the physical characteristics of the speaker. [sent-54, score-0.187]
</p><p>21 In order to com-  plete our articulatory model, however, we require physical data from which to infer these high-level articulatory goals. [sent-55, score-1.131]
</p><p>22 Electromagnetic articulography (EMA) is a method to measure the motion of the vocal tract during speech. [sent-56, score-0.566]
</p><p>23 For the following study we use the eight 2D positions common to both databases, namely the upper lip (UL), lower lip (LL), upper incisor (UI), lower incisor (LI), tongue tip (TT), tongue blade (TB), and tongue dorsum (TD). [sent-64, score-0.753]
</p><p>24 (Additionally, the MOCHA database provides velum (V) data on this plane, and TORGO provides the left and right lip corners (LL and RL) but these are excluded from study except where noted). [sent-66, score-0.223]
</p><p>25 All articulatory data is aligned with its associated acoustic data, which is transformed to Melfrequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). [sent-67, score-0.767]
</p><p>26 We approximate the tract variable space from the physical space of the articulators, in general, through principal component analysis (PCA) on the latter, and subsequent sigmoid normalization on [0, 1] . [sent-71, score-0.477]
</p><p>27 For example, the LTH tract variable is inferred by calculating the first principal component of the two-dimensional lower incisor (LI) motion in the midsagittal plane, and by normalizing the resulting univariate data through a scaled sigmoid. [sent-72, score-0.617]
</p><p>28 Tongue tip constriction location and degree (TTCL and TTCD, respectively) are inferred from the 1st and 2nd principal components of tongue tip (TT) EMA data, with TBCL and TBCD inferred similarly from tongue body (TB) data. [sent-74, score-0.555]
</p><p>29 Finally, the glottis (GLO) is inferred by voicing detection on acoustic energy below 150 Hz (O’Shaughnessy, 2000), lip aperture (LA) is the  normalized Euclidean distance between the lips, and lip protrusion (LP) is the normalized 2nd principal component of the midpoint between the lips. [sent-75, score-0.611]
</p><p>30 The result is a low-dimensional set of continuous curves describing goal-relevant articulatory variables. [sent-77, score-0.601]
</p><p>31 Figure 2, for example, shows the degree of the lip aperture (LA) over time for all instances of the /b/ phoneme in the MOCHA database. [sent-78, score-0.258]
</p><p>32 The relevant articulatory goal of lip closure is evident. [sent-79, score-0.693]
</p><p>33 , dependency) re-  lationships between relevant variables in our models, which can include measurements of tract data. [sent-86, score-0.449]
</p><p>34 The first is the standard acoustic hidden Markov model (HMM) augmented with a bigram language model, as shown in figure 3(a). [sent-88, score-0.222]
</p><p>35 Likewise, each phoneme Ph conditions t→he sub-phoneme state, Qt, whose transition probabilities Qt → Qt+1 describe the dynamics within phonemes. [sent-90, score-0.254]
</p><p>36 T Qhe variable Mt refers to hidden Gaussian indices so that the likelihoods of acoustic observations, Ot, are represented by a mixture of 4, 8, 16, or 32 Gaussians for each state and each phoneme. [sent-91, score-0.356]
</p><p>37 The second baseline model is the articulatory dynamic Bayes network (DBN-A). [sent-93, score-0.597]
</p><p>38 This augments the standard acoustic HMM by replacing hidden indices, Mt, with discrete observations of the vo-  cal tract, Kt, as shown in figure 3(b). [sent-94, score-0.268]
</p><p>39 The pattern of acoustics within each phoneme is dependent on a relatively restricted set of possible articulatory configurations (Roweis, 1999). [sent-95, score-0.715]
</p><p>40 To find these discrete positions, we obtain k vectors that best de62  scribe the articulatory data according to k-means clustering with the sum-of-squares error function. [sent-96, score-0.591]
</p><p>41 In this way, the relationship Kt → Ot allows us to learn how discretized articulatory configurations affect acoustics. [sent-98, score-0.597]
</p><p>42 Figure 3: Baseline systems: (a) acoustic hidden Markov model and (b) articulatory dynamic Bayes network. [sent-102, score-0.819]
</p><p>43 Node Wt represents the current word, Pht is the current phoneme, Qt is that phoneme’s dynamic state, Ot is the acoustic observation, Mt is the Gaussian mixture component, and Kt is the discretized articulatory configuration. [sent-103, score-0.864]
</p><p>44 4  Switching Kalman filter  Our first experimental system attempts speech recognition given only articulatory data. [sent-106, score-0.694]

</p><p>46 1, the motions of these tract variables obey critically damped second-order oscillatory relationships. [sent-109, score-0.408]
</p><p>47 We start with the simplifying assumption of linear dynamics here with allowances for random Gaussian process noise, vt, since articulatory behaviour is non-deterministic. [sent-110, score-0.71]
</p><p>48 Assuming that the relationship between yt and xt is also linear, and that the measurement noise, wt, is also Gaussian, then the dynamical articulatory system can be described by  yxt ==C Dttx t +−1w+t. [sent-113, score-0.619]
</p><p>49 Obviously, since articulatory dynamics vary significantly for different goals, we replicate eq. [sent-116, score-0.71]
</p><p>50 (2) for each phoneme and connect these continuous Kalman filters together with discrete conditioning variables for phoneme and word, resulting in the switching Kalman filter (SKF) model. [sent-117, score-0.381]
</p><p>51 5 Recognition with task dynamics Our goal is to integrate task dynamics within an ASR system for continuous sentences called TD-  ASR. [sent-122, score-0.386]
</p><p>52 Our approach is to re-rank an N-best list of sentence hypotheses according to a weighted likelihood of their articulatory realizations. [sent-123, score-0.545]
</p><p>53 wi,m has likelihoods LX (Wi) and LΛ(Wi) according to purely acoustic and articulatory interpretations of an utterance, respectively, then its overall score would be L(Wi) = αLX(Wi) + (1 α)LΛ(Wi) (3) given a weighting parameter α set manually, as in section 6. [sent-127, score-0.808]
</p><p>54 1 The TADA component In order to obtain articulatory likelihoods, LΛ(Wi), for each word sequence, we first generate articulatory realizations of those sequences according 63  to task dynamics. [sent-131, score-1.187]
</p><p>55 For example, given the syllable pub in figure 1, this table provides the targets for the GLO, VEL, TBCL, and TBCD tract variables, and the parameters for the second-order differential equation, eq. [sent-137, score-0.414]
</p><p>56 These parameters have been empirically tuned by the authors of TADA according to a generic, speakerindependent representation of the vocal tract (Saltzman and Munhall, 1989). [sent-139, score-0.507]
</p><p>57 This component takes into account various physiological aspects of human speech production, including intergestural and interarticulator co-ordination and timing (Nam and Saltzman, 2003; Goldstein and Fowler, 2003), and the neutral (“schwa”) forces of the vocal tract (Saltzman and Munhall, 1989). [sent-141, score-0.687]
</p><p>58 This component takes a sequence of gestural goals predicted by the segment-to-gesture lookup table, and produces appropriate paths for each tract variable. [sent-142, score-0.531]
</p><p>59 The result of the TADA component is a set of N 9-dimensional articulatory paths, TVi, necessary to produce the associated word sequences, Wi for i= 1. [sent-143, score-0.577]
</p><p>60 Since task dynamics is a prescriptive model and fully deterministic, TVi sequences are the canonical or default articulatory realizations of the associated sentences. [sent-146, score-0.845]
</p><p>61 These canonical realizations are independent of our training data, so we transform them in order to more closely resemble the observed articulatory behaviour in our EMA data. [sent-147, score-0.645]
</p><p>62 Towards this end, we train a switch-  ing Kalman filter identical to that in section 4, except the hidden state variable xt is replaced by the observed instantaneous canonical TVs predicted by TADA. [sent-148, score-0.252]
</p><p>63 Since the lengths of these sequences are generally unequal, we align the articulatory behaviour predicted by TADA with training data from MOCHA and TORGO using standard dynamic time warping (Sakoe and Chiba, 1978). [sent-150, score-0.665]
</p><p>64 During run-time, the articulatory sequence yt most likely to have been produced by the human data given the canonical sequence TVi is inferred by the Viterbi algorithm through the SKF model with all other variables hidden. [sent-151, score-0.755]
</p><p>65 The result is a set of articulatory sequences, TVi∗, for i= 1. [sent-152, score-0.545]
</p><p>66 2 Acoustic-articulatory inversion In order to estimate the articulatory likelihood of an utterance, we need to evaluate each transformed articulatory sequence, TVi∗, within proba-  bility distributions ranging over all tract variables. [sent-156, score-1.466]
</p><p>67 Here, each Gaussian mixture describes a probability function over TV positions given the acoustic frame at time t. [sent-166, score-0.252]
</p><p>68 Our networks are trained with acoustic and EMA-derived data as de-  scribed in section 2. [sent-168, score-0.216]
</p><p>69 3 Recognition by reranking During recognition of a test utterance, a standard acoustic HMM produces word sequence hypotheses, Wi, and associated likelihoods, L(Wi), for i= 1. [sent-171, score-0.227]
</p><p>70 The expected canonical motion of the tract variables, TVi is then produced by task dynamics 64  Figure 4: Example probability density of tongue tip constriction degree over time, inferred from acoustics. [sent-174, score-0.935]
</p><p>71 The mechanism for producing the articulatory likelihood is shown in figure 5. [sent-178, score-0.545]
</p><p>72 17  Table 2: Average log likelihood of true tract variable positions in test data, under distributions produced by mixture density networks with varying numbers of Gaussians. [sent-258, score-0.465]
</p><p>73 Similarly, the DBN-A model is compared by varying the number of discrete quantizations of articulatory configurations, as described in section 3. [sent-260, score-0.591]
</p><p>74 In all cases the DBN-A model outperforms the HMM, which highlights the benefit of explicitly conditioning acoustic observations on articulatory causes. [sent-263, score-0.732]
</p><p>75 Table 2 shows the average log likelihood over each tract variable across both databases. [sent-267, score-0.371]

</p><p>77 tract variables and observed data, on [0, 1] scale. [sent-272, score-0.408]
</p><p>78 We evaluate how closely transformations to the canonical tract variables predicted by TADA match the data. [sent-274, score-0.511]
</p><p>79 Namely, we input the known orthography for each test utterance into TADA, obtain the predicted canonical tract variables TV, and transform these according to our trained SKF. [sent-275, score-0.511]
</p><p>80 The resulting predicted and transformed sequences are aligned with our measurements derived from EMA with dynamic time warping. [sent-276, score-0.196]
</p><p>81 Finally, we measure the average difference between the observed data and  the predicted (canonical and transformed) tract variables. [sent-277, score-0.374]
</p><p>82 In all cases the transformed tract variable motion is more accurate, and significantly so at the 95% confidence level for nasal and retroflex phonemes, and at 99% for fricatives. [sent-279, score-0.496]
</p><p>83 The effect of α is clearly non-monotonic, with articulatory information clearly proving useful. [sent-289, score-0.545]
</p><p>84 Although systems whose rankings are weighted solely by the articulatory component perform better than the exclusively acoustic systems, the lists available to the former are procured from standard acoustic ASR. [sent-290, score-0.951]
</p><p>85 Although this gap is not significant, it may be the result of increased inter-speaker articulatory variation in the TORGO database, which includes more than twice as many speakers as MOCHA. [sent-293, score-0.545]
</p><p>86 The SKF model of section 4 differs from the HMM and DBN-A baseline models only in its use of continuous (rather than discrete) hid-  den dynamics and in its articulatory observations. [sent-303, score-0.766]
</p><p>87 Despite the presupposed utility of direct articulatory observations, the SKF system does not perform significantly better than the best DBN-A model. [sent-310, score-0.545]
</p><p>88 Finally, the experiments of tables 6 and 7 are repeated with the canonical tract variables passed untransformed to the probability maps generated by the MDNs. [sent-311, score-0.478]
</p><p>89 Predictably, resulting articulatory likelihoods LΛ are less representative and increasing their contribution α to the hypothesis reranking does not improve TD-ASR performance significantly, and in some instances worsens it. [sent-312, score-0.621]
</p><p>90 7  Discussion and conclusions  The articulatory medium of speech rarely informs modern speech recognition. [sent-314, score-0.763]
</p><p>91 We have demonstrated that the use of direct articulatory knowledge can substantially reduce phoneme and word errors in speech recognition, especially if that knowledge is motivated by high-level abstractions of vocal tract behaviour. [sent-315, score-1.25]
</p><p>92 Task dynamic theory provides a coherent and biologically plausible model of speech production with consequences for phonology (Browman and Goldstein, 1986), neurolinguistics (Guenther and Perkell, 2004), and the evolution of speech and language (Goldstein et al. [sent-316, score-0.377]
</p><p>93 This integration is accomplished by stochastically transforming predicted articulatory dynamics and by calculating the likelihoods of these dynamics according to speaker data. [sent-320, score-1.013]
</p><p>94 Other errors common to both sources of data include phoneme insertion errors, normally vowels, which appear to co-occur with some spurious motion of the tongue between segments, especially for longer N-best lists. [sent-326, score-0.261]
</p><p>95 As more articulatory  data becomes  available  and as theories of speech production become more refined, we expect that their combined value to speech recognition will become indispensable. [sent-328, score-0.858]

<p>Author: Daniil Umanski ; Federico Sangati</p><p>Abstract: The growing availability of spoken language corpora presents new opportunities for enriching the methodologies of speech and language therapy. In this paper, we present a novel approach for constructing speech motor exercises, based on linguistic knowledge extracted from spoken language corpora. In our study with the Dutch Spoken Corpus, syllabic inventories were obtained by means of automatic syllabification of the spoken language data. Our experimental syllabification method exhibited a reliable performance, and allowed for the acquisition of syllabic tokens from the corpus. Consequently, the syl- labic tokens were integrated in a tool for clinicians, a result which holds the potential of contributing to the current state of speech motor training methodologies.</p><p>3 0.080341972 <a title="74-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Combining_Data_and_Mathematical_Models_of_Language_Change.html">61 acl-2010-Combining Data and Mathematical Models of Language Change</a></p>

We explore several alternative alignment methods that employ phonetics, integer programming, and sets of constraints, and propose a novel approach of refining the EM alignment by aggregation of best alignments. We perform both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of the assortment of methods. We show that our proposed EM-Aggregation algorithm leads to the improvement of the state of the art in letter-to-phoneme conversion on several different data sets.</p><p>6 0.058187194 <a title="74-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Modeling_Norms_of_Turn-Taking_in_Multi-Party_Conversation.html">173 acl-2010-Modeling Norms of Turn-Taking in Multi-Party Conversation</a></p>

<p>Author: Daniil Umanski ; Federico Sangati</p><p>Abstract: The growing availability of spoken language corpora presents new opportunities for enriching the methodologies of speech and language therapy. In this paper, we present a novel approach for constructing speech motor exercises, based on linguistic knowledge extracted from spoken language corpora. In our study with the Dutch Spoken Corpus, syllabic inventories were obtained by means of automatic syllabification of the spoken language data. Our experimental syllabification method exhibited a reliable performance, and allowed for the acquisition of syllabic tokens from the corpus. Consequently, the syl- labic tokens were integrated in a tool for clinicians, a result which holds the potential of contributing to the current state of speech motor training methodologies.</p><p>3 0.73053581 <a title="74-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-Modeling_Norms_of_Turn-Taking_in_Multi-Party_Conversation.html">173 acl-2010-Modeling Norms of Turn-Taking in Multi-Party Conversation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kornel Laskowski</p><p>Abstract: Substantial research effort has been invested in recent decades into the computational study and automatic processing of multi-party conversation. While most aspects of conversational speech have benefited from a wide availability of analytic, computationally tractable techniques, only qualitative assessments are available for characterizing multi-party turn-taking. The current paper attempts to address this deficiency by first proposing a framework for computing turn-taking model perplexity, and then by evaluating several multi-participant modeling approaches. Experiments show that direct multi-participant models do not generalize to held out data, and likely never will, for practical reasons. In contrast, the Extended-Degree-of-Overlap model represents a suitable candidate for future work in this area, and is shown to successfully predict the distribution of speech in time and across participants in previously unseen conversations.</p><p>4 0.6959914 <a title="74-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Domain_Adaptation_of_Maximum_Entropy_Language_Models.html">91 acl-2010-Domain Adaptation of Maximum Entropy Language Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Mohit Bansal ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple but accurate parser which exploits both large tree fragments and symbol refinement. We parse with all fragments of the training set, in contrast to much recent work on tree selection in data-oriented parsing and treesubstitution grammar learning. We require only simple, deterministic grammar symbol refinement, in contrast to recent work on latent symbol refinement. Moreover, our parser requires no explicit lexicon machinery, instead parsing input sentences as character streams. Despite its simplicity, our parser achieves accuracies of over 88% F1 on the standard English WSJ task, which is competitive with substantially more complicated state-of-theart lexicalized and latent-variable parsers. Additional specific contributions center on making implicit all-fragments parsing efficient, including a coarse-to-fine inference scheme and a new graph encoding.</p><p>3 0.33798096 <a title="74-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Complexity_Metrics_in_an_Incremental_Right-Corner_Parser.html">65 acl-2010-Complexity Metrics in an Incremental Right-Corner Parser</a></p>
<p>Author: Stephen Wu ; Asaf Bachrach ; Carlos Cardenas ; William Schuler</p><p>Abstract: Hierarchical HMM (HHMM) parsers make promising cognitive models: while they use a bounded model of working memory and pursue incremental hypotheses in parallel, they still achieve parsing accuracies competitive with chart-based techniques. This paper aims to validate that a right-corner HHMM parser is also able to produce complexity metrics, which quantify a reader’s incremental difficulty in understanding a sentence. Besides defining standard metrics in the HHMM framework, a new metric, embedding difference, is also proposed, which tests the hypothesis that HHMM store elements represents syntactic working memory. Results show that HHMM surprisal outperforms all other evaluated metrics in predicting reading times, and that embedding difference makes a significant, independent contribution.</p><p>4 0.3352412 <a title="74-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-A_Study_of_Information_Retrieval_Weighting_Schemes_for_Sentiment_Analysis.html">18 acl-2010-A Study of Information Retrieval Weighting Schemes for Sentiment Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Georgios Paltoglou ; Mike Thelwall</p><p>Abstract: Most sentiment analysis approaches use as baseline a support vector machines (SVM) classifier with binary unigram weights. In this paper, we explore whether more sophisticated feature weighting schemes from Information Retrieval can enhance classification accuracy. We show that variants of the classic tf.idf scheme adapted to sentiment analysis provide significant increases in accuracy, especially when using a sublinear function for term frequency weights and document frequency smoothing. The techniques are tested on a wide selection of data sets and produce the best accuracy to our knowledge.</p><p>5 0.33465323 <a title="74-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Experiments_in_Graph-Based_Semi-Supervised_Learning_Methods_for_Class-Instance_Acquisition.html">109 acl-2010-Experiments in Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning Methods for Class-Instance Acquisition</a></p>
<p>Author: Partha Pratim Talukdar ; Fernando Pereira</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms have been successfully used to extract class-instance pairs from large unstructured and structured text collections. However, a careful comparison of different graph-based SSL algorithms on that task has been lacking. We compare three graph-based SSL algorithms for class-instance acquisition on a variety of graphs constructed from different domains. We find that the recently proposed MAD algorithm is the most effective. We also show that class-instance extraction can be significantly improved by adding semantic information in the form of instance-attribute edges derived from an independently developed knowledge base. All of our code and data will be made publicly available to encourage reproducible research in this area.</p><p>6 0.33446848 <a title="74-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Latent_Variable_Models_of_Selectional_Preference.html">158 acl-2010-Latent Variable Models of Selectional Preference</a></p>

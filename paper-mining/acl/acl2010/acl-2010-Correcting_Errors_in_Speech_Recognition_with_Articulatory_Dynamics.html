<p>Author: Daniil Umanski ; Federico Sangati</p><p>Abstract: The growing availability of spoken language corpora presents new opportunities for enriching the methodologies of speech and language therapy. In this paper, we present a novel approach for constructing speech motor exercises, based on linguistic knowledge extracted from spoken language corpora. In our study with the Dutch Spoken Corpus, syllabic inventories were obtained by means of automatic syllabification of the spoken language data. Our experimental syllabification method exhibited a reliable performance, and allowed for the acquisition of syllabic tokens from the corpus. Consequently, the syl- labic tokens were integrated in a tool for clinicians, a result which holds the potential of contributing to the current state of speech motor training methodologies.</p><p>3 0.13280958 <a title="74-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Letter-Phoneme_Alignment%3A_An_Exploration.html">170 acl-2010-Letter-Phoneme Alignment: An Exploration</a></p>
<p>Author: Sittichai Jiampojamarn ; Grzegorz Kondrak</p><p>Abstract: Letter-phoneme alignment is usually generated by a straightforward application of the EM algorithm. We explore several alternative alignment methods that employ phonetics, integer programming, and sets of constraints, and propose a novel approach of refining the EM alignment by aggregation of best alignments. We perform both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of the assortment of methods. We show that our proposed EM-Aggregation algorithm leads to the improvement of the state of the art in letter-to-phoneme conversion on several different data sets.</p><p>4 0.10821959 <a title="74-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Learning_5000_Relational_Extractors.html">159 acl-2010-Learning 5000 Relational Extractors</a></p>
<p>Author: Raphael Hoffmann ; Congle Zhang ; Daniel S. Weld</p><p>Abstract: Many researchers are trying to use information extraction (IE) to create large-scale knowledge bases from natural language text on the Web. However, the primary approach (supervised learning of relation-specific extractors) requires manually-labeled training data for each relation and doesn’t scale to the thousands of relations encoded in Web text. This paper presents LUCHS, a self-supervised, relation-specific IE system which learns 5025 relations more than an order of magnitude greater than any previous approach with an average F1 score of 61%. Crucial to LUCHS’s performance is an automated system for dynamic lexicon learning, which allows it to learn accurately from heuristically-generated training data, which is often noisy and sparse. — —</p><p>5 0.10256764 <a title="74-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Classification_of_Feedback_Expressions_in_Multimodal_Data.html">58 acl-2010-Classification of Feedback Expressions in Multimodal Data</a></p>

We have employed an HMM statistical framework for both speech recognition and synthesis which provides transformation mechanisms to adapt the synthesized voice in TTS (text-to-speech) using the recognized voice in ASR (automatic speech recognition). An important application for this research is personalised speech-to-speech translation that will use the voice of the speaker in the input language to utter the translated sentences in the output language. In mobile environments this enhances the users’ interaction across language barriers by making the output speech sound more like the original speaker’s way of speaking, even if she or he could not speak the output language.</p><p>4 0.56348222 <a title="74-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Using_Speech_to_Reply_to_SMS_Messages_While_Driving%3A_An_In-Car_Simulator_User_Study.html">254 acl-2010-Using Speech to Reply to SMS Messages While Driving: An In-Car Simulator User Study</a></p>
<p>Author: Yun-Cheng Ju ; Tim Paek</p><p>Abstract: Speech recognition affords automobile drivers a hands-free, eyes-free method of replying to Short Message Service (SMS) text messages. Although a voice search approach based on template matching has been shown to be more robust to the challenging acoustic environment of automobiles than using dictation, users may have difficulties verifying whether SMS response templates match their intended meaning, especially while driving. Using a high-fidelity driving simulator, we compared dictation for SMS replies versus voice search in increasingly difficult driving conditions. Although the two approaches did not differ in terms of driving performance measures, users made about six times more errors on average using dictation than voice search. 1</p><p>5 0.56137764 <a title="74-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Combining_Data_and_Mathematical_Models_of_Language_Change.html">61 acl-2010-Combining Data and Mathematical Models of Language Change</a></p>
<p>Author: Morgan Sonderegger ; Partha Niyogi</p><p>Abstract: English noun/verb (N/V) pairs (contract, cement) have undergone complex patterns of change between 3 stress patterns for several centuries. We describe a longitudinal dataset of N/V pair pronunciations, leading to a set of properties to be accounted for by any computational model. We analyze the dynamics of 5 dynamical systems models of linguistic populations, each derived from a model of learning by individuals. We compare each model’s dynamics to a set of properties observed in the N/V data, and reason about how assumptions about individual learning affect population-level dynamics.</p><p>6 0.47948542 <a title="74-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Modeling_Norms_of_Turn-Taking_in_Multi-Party_Conversation.html">173 acl-2010-Modeling Norms of Turn-Taking in Multi-Party Conversation</a></p>

<p>Author: Stephen Wu ; Asaf Bachrach ; Carlos Cardenas ; William Schuler</p><p>Abstract: Hierarchical HMM (HHMM) parsers make promising cognitive models: while they use a bounded model of working memory and pursue incremental hypotheses in parallel, they still achieve parsing accuracies competitive with chart-based techniques. This paper aims to validate that a right-corner HHMM parser is also able to produce complexity metrics, which quantify a reader’s incremental difficulty in understanding a sentence. Besides defining standard metrics in the HHMM framework, a new metric, embedding difference, is also proposed, which tests the hypothesis that HHMM store elements represents syntactic working memory. Results show that HHMM surprisal outperforms all other evaluated metrics in predicting reading times, and that embedding difference makes a significant, independent contribution.</p><p>5 0.39819431 <a title="74-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Faster_Parsing_by_Supertagger_Adaptation.html">114 acl-2010-Faster Parsing by Supertagger Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan K. Kummerfeld ; Jessika Roesner ; Tim Dawborn ; James Haggerty ; James R. Curran ; Stephen Clark</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel self-training method for a parser which uses a lexicalised grammar and supertagger, focusing on increasing the speed of the parser rather than its accuracy. The idea is to train the supertagger on large amounts of parser output, so that the supertagger can learn to supply the supertags that the parser will eventually choose as part of the highestscoring derivation. Since the supertagger supplies fewer supertags overall, the parsing speed is increased. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method using a CCG supertagger and parser, obtain- ing significant speed increases on newspaper text with no loss in accuracy. We also show that the method can be used to adapt the CCG parser to new domains, obtaining accuracy and speed improvements for Wikipedia and biomedical text.</p><p>6 0.39807916 <a title="74-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Blocked_Inference_in_Bayesian_Tree_Substitution_Grammars.html">53 acl-2010-Blocked Inference in Bayesian Tree Substitution Grammars</a></p>

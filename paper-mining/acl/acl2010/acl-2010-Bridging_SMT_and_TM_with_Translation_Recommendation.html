</p><p>3 Furthermore, it is possible for the end-user to achieve a desired balance between precision and recall by adjusting confidence levels. [sent-11, score-0.356]
</p><p>4 1 Introduction Recent years have witnessed rapid developments in statistical machine translation (SMT), with considerable improvements in translation quality. [sent-12, score-0.202]
</p><p>5 However, to date most of the research has focused on better confidence measures for MT, e. [sent-22, score-0.192]
</p><p>6 based on training regression models to perform confidence estimation on scores assigned by post-editors (cf. [sent-24, score-0.317]
</p><p>7 Given that most postediting work is (still) based on TM output, we propose to recommend MT outputs which are better than TM hits to post-editors. [sent-27, score-0.199]
</p><p>8 In this framework, post-editors still work with the TM while benefiting from (better) SMT outputs; the assets in TMs are not wasted and TM fuzzy match scores can  still be used to estimate (the upper bound of) postediting labor. [sent-28, score-0.478]
</p><p>9 Firstly, the recommendation should have high precision, otherwise it would be confusing for post-editors and may negatively affect the lower bound of the postediting effort. [sent-30, score-0.289]
</p><p>10 Finally, post-editors should be able to easily adjust the recommendation threshold to particular requirements without having to retrain the model. [sent-34, score-0.244]
</p><p>11 The first strand is confidence estimation for MT, initiated by (Ueffing et al. [sent-42, score-0.3]
</p><p>12 The former experimented with confidence estimation with several different learning algorithms; the latter uses word-level confidence measures to determine whether a particular translation choice should be accepted or rejected in an interactive translation system. [sent-48, score-0.634]
</p><p>13 The second strand of research focuses on combining TM information with an SMT system, so that the SMT system can produce better target language output when there is an exact or close match in the TM (Simard and Isabelle, 2009). [sent-49, score-0.262]
</p><p>14 A third strand of research tries to incorporate confidence measures into a post-editing environment. [sent-51, score-0.252]
</p><p>15 Instead of modeling on translation quality (often measured by automatic evaluation scores), this research uses  regression on both the automatic scores and scores assigned by post-editors. [sent-54, score-0.262]
</p><p>16 , 2009b), which applies Inductive Confidence Machines and a larger set of features to model post-editors’ judgement ofthe translation quality between ‘good’ and ‘bad’, or among three levels of post-editing effort. [sent-56, score-0.179]
</p><p>17 However, we use outputs and features from the TM explicitly; therefore instead of having to solve a regression problem, we only have to solve a much easier binary prediction problem which can be integrated into TMs in a straightforward manner. [sent-58, score-0.209]
</p><p>18 Because of this, the precision and recall scores reported in this paper are not directly comparable to those in (Specia et al. [sent-59, score-0.188]
</p><p>19 4  Translation Recommendation as Binary Classification  We use an SVM binary classifier to predict the relative quality of the SMT output to make a recommendation. [sent-69, score-0.144]
</p><p>20 The SVM classifier uses features from the SMT system, the TM and additional linguistic features to estimate whether the SMT output is better than the hit from the TM. [sent-70, score-0.273]
</p><p>21 1 Problem Formulation As we treat translation recommendation as a binary classification problem, we have a pair of outputs from TM and MT for each sentence. [sent-72, score-0.497]
</p><p>22 Ideally the classifier will recommend the output that needs less post-editing effort. [sent-73, score-0.107]
</p><p>23 2  Recommendation Confidence Estimation  In classical settings involving SVMs, confidence levels are represented as margins of binary predictions. [sent-82, score-0.315]
</p><p>24 What is more preferable is a probabilistic confidence score (e. [sent-84, score-0.236]
</p><p>25 , 2007) to obtain the posterior probability of a classification, which is used as the confidence score in our system. [sent-88, score-0.278]
</p><p>26 2 The TM Feature The TM feature is the fuzzy match (Sikes, 2007) cost of the TM hit. [sent-100, score-0.417]
</p><p>27 The calculation of fuzzy match score itself is one of the core technologies in TM systems and varies among different vendors. [sent-101, score-0.425]
</p><p>28 We compute fuzzy match cost as the minimum Edit Distance (Levenshtein, 1966) between the source and TM entry, normalized by the length of the  source as in (6), as most of the current implementations are based on edit distance while allowing some additional flexible matching. [sent-102, score-0.56]
</p><p>29 For fuzzy match scores F, this fuzzy match cost hfm roughly corresponds to 1−F. [sent-104, score-0.895]
</p><p>30 Tchlaessdiiffficear-tion, and allows direct comparison between a pure TM system and a translation recommendation system in Section 5. [sent-106, score-0.401]
</p><p>31 3 System-Independent Features We use several features that are independent of the translation system, which are useful when a third-party translation service is used or the MT system is simply treated as a black-box. [sent-111, score-0.276]
</p><p>32 These features are source and target side LM scores, pseudo source fuzzy match scores and IBM model 1 scores. [sent-112, score-0.551]
</p><p>33 The inputs that have lower perplexity or higher LM score are more similar to the dataset on which the SMT system is built. [sent-115, score-0.129]
</p><p>34 Language model perplexity of the MT outputs are calculated, and LM probability is already part of the MT systems scores. [sent-118, score-0.117]
</p><p>35 LM scores on TM outputs are also computed, though they are not as informative as scores on the MT side, since TM outputs should be grammatically perfect. [sent-119, score-0.266]
</p><p>36 We compute the fuzzy match score between the original source sentence and this pseudo-source. [sent-122, score-0.448]
</p><p>37 Therefore, the fuzzy match score here gives an estimation of the confidence level of the output. [sent-124, score-0.665]
</p><p>38 The fuzzy match score does not measure whether the hit could be a correct translation, i. [sent-127, score-0.525]
</p><p>39 , 1993) serves as a rough estimation of how good a translation it is on the word level; for the MT output, on the other hand, it is a black-box feature to estimate translation quality when the information from the translation model is not available. [sent-131, score-0.383]
</p><p>40 1 Experimental Settings  Our raw data set is an English–French translation memory with technical translation from Symantec, consisting of 5 1K sentence pairs. [sent-134, score-0.202]
</p><p>41 2  The Evaluation Metrics  We measure the quality of the classification by precision and recall. [sent-150, score-0.165]
</p><p>42 Let A be the set of recommended MT outputs, and B be the set of MT outputs that have lower TER than TM hits. [sent-151, score-0.181]
</p><p>43 We standardly define precision P, recall R and F-value as in (7): 1More specifically, we performed 5 iterations of Model 1,  5 iterations of HMM, 3 iterations of Model 3, and 3 iterations of Model 4. [sent-152, score-0.216]
</p><p>44 3 Recommendation Results In Table 1, we report recommendation performance using MT and TM system features (SYS), system features plus system-independent features (ALL:SYS+SI), and system-independent features only (SI). [sent-154, score-0.484]
</p><p>45 2645  From Table 1, we observe that MT and TM system-internal features are very useful for producing a stable (as indicated by the smaller confidence interval) recommendation system (SYS). [sent-185, score-0.51]
</p><p>46 This indicates that at the default confidence level, current system-external (resp. [sent-191, score-0.192]
</p><p>47 2 that combing both system-internal and external features can yield higher, more stable precision when adjusting the confidence levels of the classifier. [sent-196, score-0.359]
</p><p>48 Additionally, the performance of system SI is promising given the fact that we are using only a limited number of simple features, which demonstrates a good prospect of applying our recommendation system to MT systems where we do not have access to their internal features. [sent-197, score-0.3]
</p><p>49 4  Further Improving Recommendation Precision Table 1 shows that classification recall is very high, which suggests that precision can still be improved, even though the F-score is not low. [sent-199, score-0.176]
</p><p>50 Considering that TM is the dominant technology used by post-editors, a recommendation to replace the hit from the TM would require more confidence, i. [sent-200, score-0.344]
</p><p>51 9 precision at the cost of some recall, if necessary. [sent-204, score-0.129]
</p><p>52 1 Classifier Margins We experiment with different margins on the training data to tune precision and recall in order to obtain a desired balance. [sent-208, score-0.249]
</p><p>53 We try to achieve higher precision by enforcing a larger bias towards negative examples in the training set so that some borderline positive in-  stances would actually be labeled as negative, and the classifier would have higher precision in the prediction stage as in (8). [sent-211, score-0.284]
</p><p>54 05, other configurations all obtain higher precision than TER + 0. [sent-266, score-0.136]
</p><p>55 85 precision without a big sacrifice in recall with b=0. [sent-268, score-0.175]
</p><p>56 This is one limitation of using biased margins to 626  obtain high precision. [sent-273, score-0.122]
</p><p>57 2 Adjusting Confidence Levels An alternative to using a biased margin is to output a confidence score during prediction and to threshold on the confidence score. [sent-279, score-0.533]
</p><p>58 We use the SVM confidence estimation techniques in Section 4. [sent-281, score-0.24]
</p><p>59 2 to obtain the confidence  level of the recommendation, and change the confidence threshold for recommendation when necessary. [sent-282, score-0.65]
</p><p>60 In a TM environment, some users simply ignore TM hits below a certain fuzzy match score F (usually from 0. [sent-284, score-0.472]
</p><p>61 This fuzzy match score reflects the confidence of recommending the TM hits. [sent-287, score-0.715]
</p><p>62 To obtain the confidence of recommending an SMT output, our baseline (FM) uses fuzzy match costs hFM ≈ 1−F (cf. [sent-288, score-0.674]
</p><p>63 2e)r words, TthMe higher the fuzzy match cost of the TM hit is (lower fuzzy match score), the higher the confidence of recommending the SMT output. [sent-295, score-1.211]
</p><p>64 Confdience  Figure 1: Precision Changes with Confidence Level Figure 1 shows that the precision curve of FM is low and flat when the fuzzy match costs are low (from 0 to 0. [sent-297, score-0.474]
</p><p>65 6), indicating that it is unwise to recommend an SMT output when the TM hit has a low fuzzy match cost (corresponding to higher fuzzy match score, from 0. [sent-298, score-0.996]
</p><p>66 We also observe that the precision of the recommendation receives a boost when the fuzzy match costs for the TM  hits are above 0. [sent-300, score-0.765]
</p><p>67 3), indicating that SMT output should be recommended when the TM hit has a high fuzzy match cost (low fuzzy match score). [sent-302, score-1.049]
</p><p>68 With this boost, the precision of the baseline system can reach 0. [sent-303, score-0.121]
</p><p>69 85, demonstrating that a proper thresholding of fuzzy match scores can be used effectively to discriminate the recommendation of the TM hit from the recommendation of the SMT output. [sent-304, score-1.021]
</p><p>70 For example, an excellent SMT output should be recommended even if there exists a good TM hit (e. [sent-306, score-0.251]
</p><p>71 On the other hand, a misleading SMT output should not be recommended if there exists a poor but useful TM match (e. [sent-310, score-0.274]
</p><p>72 Figure 1 shows that both the SYS and the ALL setting consistently outperform FM, indicating that our classification scheme can better integrate the MT output into the  TM system than this naive baseline. [sent-315, score-0.119]
</p><p>73 The SI feature set does not perform well when the confidence level is set above 0. [sent-316, score-0.192]
</p><p>74 However, when the requirement on precision is not that high, and the MT-internal features are not available, it would still be desirable to obtain translation recommendations with these black-box features. [sent-320, score-0.296]
</p><p>75 Note that our system will return the TM entry when there is an exact match, so the overall precision of the system 627  is above the precision score we set here in a mature TM environment, as a significant portion of the material to be translated will have a complete match in the TM system. [sent-345, score-0.409]
</p><p>76 In Table 3 for MODEL@ K, the recall scores are achieved when the prediction precision is better than K with 0. [sent-346, score-0.214]
</p><p>77 However, if we want to demand further recommendation precision (more conservative in recommending SMT output), the recall level will begin to drop more quickly. [sent-350, score-0.459]
</p><p>78 If we use only system-independent features (SI), we cannot achieve as high precision as with other models even if we sacrifice more recall. [sent-351, score-0.178]
</p><p>79 3 we suggested three sets of system-independent features: features based on the source- and target-side language model (LM), the IBM Model 1(M 1) and the fuzzy match scores on pseudo-source (PS). [sent-399, score-0.479]
</p><p>80 In sum, all the three sets of system-independent features improve the precision and F-scores of the MT and TM system features. [sent-401, score-0.167]
</p><p>81 The improvement is not significant, but improvement on every set of  system-independent features gives some credit to the capability of SI features, as does the fact that SI features perform close to SYS features in Table 1. [sent-402, score-0.138]
</p><p>82 6  Analysis of Post-Editing Effort  A natural question on the integration models is whether the classification reduces the effort of the translators and post-editors: after reading these recommendations, will they translate/edit less than they would otherwise have to? [sent-403, score-0.107]
</p><p>83 As we have not yet conducted a manual post-editing experiment, we conduct two sets of analyses, trying to show which type of edits will be required for different recommendation confidence levels. [sent-405, score-0.511]
</p><p>84 the instances in which MT output is recommended over the TM hit) are given in Table 5. [sent-412, score-0.151]
</p><p>85 When an MT output is recommended, its TM counterpart will require a larger average number of total edits than the MT output, as we expect. [sent-413, score-0.126]
</p><p>86 In this case, the recommended MT output actually saves more effort for the editors than what is shown by the TER score. [sent-415, score-0.21]
</p><p>87 the instances in which MT output is not recommended over the TM hit). [sent-419, score-0.151]
</p><p>88 In this case, the MT output requires considerably more edits than the TM hits in terms of all four TER edit types, i. [sent-420, score-0.27]
</p><p>89 2  Edit Statistics on Recommendations of Higher Confidence We present the edit statistics of recommendations with higher confidence in Table 7. [sent-425, score-0.372]
</p><p>90 Comparing Tables 5 and 7, we see that if recommended with higher confidence, the MT output will need substantially less edits than the TM output: e. [sent-426, score-0.247]
</p><p>91 From the characteristics of the high confidence recommendations, we suspect that these mainly comprise harder to translate (i. [sent-430, score-0.192]
</p><p>92 By providing them with the TM output, the MT output and the one recommended to edit, we can measure the true accuracy of our recommendation, as well as the post-editing time we save for the post-editors; •  Apply the presented method on open domain data and evaluate it using crowdsourcing. [sent-512, score-0.151]
</p><p>93 Insodoing we handle the problem of MT quality estimation as binary prediction instead of regression. [sent-516, score-0.137]
</p><p>94 We explore features from inside the MT system, from the TM, as well as features that make no assumption on the translation model for the binary classification. [sent-519, score-0.224]
</p><p>95 89 recall, and even higher precision if  we sacrifice more recall. [sent-523, score-0.153]
</p><p>96 We present results to show that, if measured by number, type and content of edits in TER, the recommended sentences produced by the classification model would bring about less post-editing effort than the TM outputs. [sent-526, score-0.25]
</p><p>97 A user study can serve two purposes: 1) it can validate the effectiveness of the method by measuring the amount of edit effort it saves; and 2) the byproduct of the user study post-edited sentences can be used to generate HTER scores to train a better recommendation model.

<p>Author: Deyi Xiong ; Min Zhang ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: Automatic error detection is desired in the post-processing to improve machine translation quality. The previous work is largely based on confidence estimation using system-based features, such as word posterior probabilities calculated from Nbest lists or word lattices. We propose to incorporate two groups of linguistic features, which convey information from outside machine translation systems, into error detection: lexical and syntactic features. We use a maximum entropy classifier to predict translation errors by integrating word posterior probability feature and linguistic features. The experimental results show that 1) linguistic features alone outperform word posterior probability based confidence estimation in error detection; and 2) linguistic features can further provide complementary information when combined with word confidence scores, which collectively reduce the classification error rate by 18.52% and improve the F measure by 16.37%.</p><p>3 0.14984843 <a title="56-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Boosting-Based_System_Combination_for_Machine_Translation.html">54 acl-2010-Boosting-Based System Combination for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Xiao ; Jingbo Zhu ; Muhua Zhu ; Huizhen Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a simple and effective method to address the issue of how to generate diversified translation systems from a single Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) engine for system combination. Our method is based on the framework of boosting. First, a sequence of weak translation systems is generated from a baseline system in an iterative manner. Then, a strong translation system is built from the ensemble of these weak translation systems. To adapt boosting to SMT system combination, several key components of the original boosting algorithms are redesigned in this work. We evaluate our method on Chinese-to-English Machine Translation (MT) tasks in three baseline systems, including a phrase-based system, a hierarchical phrasebased system and a syntax-based system. The experimental results on three NIST evaluation test sets show that our method leads to significant improvements in translation accuracy over the baseline systems. 1</p><p>4 0.13373096 <a title="56-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Cross-Language_Document_Summarization_Based_on_Machine_Translation_Quality_Prediction.html">77 acl-2010-Cross-Language Document Summarization Based on Machine Translation Quality Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaojun Wan ; Huiying Li ; Jianguo Xiao</p><p>Abstract: Cross-language document summarization is a task of producing a summary in one language for a document set in a different language. Existing methods simply use machine translation for document translation or summary translation. However, current machine translation services are far from satisfactory, which results in that the quality of the cross-language summary is usually very poor, both in readability and content. In this paper, we propose to consider the translation quality of each sentence in the English-to-Chinese cross-language summarization process. First, the translation quality of each English sentence in the document set is predicted with the SVM regression method, and then the quality score of each sentence is incorporated into the summarization process. Finally, the English sentences with high translation quality and high informativeness are selected and translated to form the Chinese summary. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed approach. 1</p><p>5 0.13247541 <a title="56-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Learning_to_Translate_with_Source_and_Target_Syntax.html">169 acl-2010-Learning to Translate with Source and Target Syntax</a></p>
<p>Author: David Chiang</p><p>Abstract: Statistical translation models that try to capture the recursive structure of language have been widely adopted over the last few years. These models make use of varying amounts of information from linguistic theory: some use none at all, some use information about the grammar of the target language, some use information about the grammar of the source language. But progress has been slower on translation models that are able to learn the relationship between the grammars of both the source and target language. We discuss the reasons why this has been a challenge, review existing attempts to meet this challenge, and show how some old and new ideas can be combined into a sim- ple approach that uses both source and target syntax for significant improvements in translation accuracy.</p><p>6 0.1197743 <a title="56-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-TrustRank%3A_Inducing_Trust_in_Automatic_Translations_via_Ranking.html">244 acl-2010-TrustRank: Inducing Trust in Automatic Translations via Ranking</a></p>

<p>Author: Yifan He ; Yanjun Ma ; Josef van Genabith ; Andy Way</p><p>Abstract: We propose a translation recommendation framework to integrate Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) output with Translation Memory (TM) systems. The framework recommends SMT outputs to a TM user when it predicts that SMT outputs are more suitable for post-editing than the hits provided by the TM. We describe an implementation of this framework using an SVM binary classifier. We exploit methods to fine-tune the classifier and investigate a variety of features of different types. We rely on automatic MT evaluation metrics to approximate human judgements in our experiments. Experimental results show that our system can achieve 0.85 precision at 0.89 recall, excluding ex- act matches. Furthermore, it is possible for the end-user to achieve a desired balance between precision and recall by adjusting confidence levels.</p><p>2 0.78136528 <a title="56-lsi-2" href="./acl-2010-Balancing_User_Effort_and_Translation_Error_in_Interactive_Machine_Translation_via_Confidence_Measures.html">45 acl-2010-Balancing User Effort and Translation Error in Interactive Machine Translation via Confidence Measures</a></p>
<p>Author: Jesus Gonzalez Rubio ; Daniel Ortiz Martinez ; Francisco Casacuberta</p><p>Abstract: This work deals with the application of confidence measures within an interactivepredictive machine translation system in order to reduce human effort. If a small loss in translation quality can be tolerated for the sake of efficiency, user effort can be saved by interactively translating only those initial translations which the confidence measure classifies as incorrect. We apply confidence estimation as a way to achieve a balance between user effort savings and final translation error. Empirical results show that our proposal allows to obtain almost perfect translations while significantly reducing user effort.</p><p>3 0.77414095 <a title="56-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-TrustRank%3A_Inducing_Trust_in_Automatic_Translations_via_Ranking.html">244 acl-2010-TrustRank: Inducing Trust in Automatic Translations via Ranking</a></p>

The previous work is largely based on confidence estimation using system-based features, such as word posterior probabilities calculated from Nbest lists or word lattices.

<p>Author: Fei Huang ; Alexander Yates</p><p>Abstract: Most supervised language processing systems show a significant drop-off in performance when they are tested on text that comes from a domain significantly different from the domain of the training data. Semantic role labeling techniques are typically trained on newswire text, and in tests their performance on fiction is as much as 19% worse than their performance on newswire text. We investigate techniques for building open-domain semantic role labeling systems that approach the ideal of a train-once, use-anywhere system. We leverage recently-developed techniques for learning representations of text using latent-variable language models, and extend these techniques to ones that provide the kinds of features that are useful for semantic role labeling. In experiments, our novel system reduces error by 16% relative to the previous state of the art on out-of-domain text.</p><p>5 0.76690954 <a title="56-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Experiments_in_Graph-Based_Semi-Supervised_Learning_Methods_for_Class-Instance_Acquisition.html">109 acl-2010-Experiments in Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning Methods for Class-Instance Acquisition</a></p>
<p>Author: Partha Pratim Talukdar ; Fernando Pereira</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms have been successfully used to extract class-instance pairs from large unstructured and structured text collections. However, a careful comparison of different graph-based SSL algorithms on that task has been lacking. We compare three graph-based SSL algorithms for class-instance acquisition on a variety of graphs constructed from different domains. We find that the recently proposed MAD algorithm is the most effective. We also show that class-instance extraction can be significantly improved by adding semantic information in the form of instance-attribute edges derived from an independently developed knowledge base. All of our code and data will be made publicly available to encourage reproducible research in this area.</p><p>6 0.7632668 <a title="56-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Improving_the_Use_of_Pseudo-Words_for_Evaluating_Selectional_Preferences.html">148 acl-2010-Improving the Use of Pseudo-Words for Evaluating Selectional Preferences</a></p>

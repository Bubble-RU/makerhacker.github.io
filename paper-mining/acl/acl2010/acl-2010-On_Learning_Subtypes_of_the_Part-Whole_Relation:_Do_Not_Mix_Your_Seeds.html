<p>Author: Zornitsa Kozareva ; Eduard Hovy</p><p>Abstract: A challenging problem in open information extraction and text mining is the learning of the selectional restrictions of semantic relations. We propose a minimally supervised bootstrapping algorithm that uses a single seed and a recursive lexico-syntactic pattern to learn the arguments and the supertypes of a diverse set of semantic relations from the Web. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on multiple semantic relations expressed using “verb”, “noun”, and “verb prep” lexico-syntactic patterns. Humanbased evaluation shows that the accuracy of the harvested information is about 90%. We also compare our results with existing knowledge base to outline the similarities and differences of the granularity and diversity of the harvested knowledge.</p><p>3 0.13632341 <a title="181-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Automatically_Generating_Term_Frequency_Induced_Taxonomies.html">43 acl-2010-Automatically Generating Term Frequency Induced Taxonomies</a></p>

<p>Author: Alan Ritter ; Mausam Mausam ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: The computation of selectional preferences, the admissible argument values for a relation, is a well-known NLP task with broad applicability. We present LDA-SP, which utilizes LinkLDA (Erosheva et al., 2004) to model selectional preferences. By simultaneously inferring latent topics and topic distributions over relations, LDA-SP combines the benefits of previous approaches: like traditional classbased approaches, it produces humaninterpretable classes describing each relation’s preferences, but it is competitive with non-class-based methods in predictive power. We compare LDA-SP to several state-ofthe-art methods achieving an 85% increase in recall at 0.9 precision over mutual information (Erk, 2007). We also evaluate LDA-SP’s effectiveness at filtering improper applications of inference rules, where we show substantial improvement over Pantel et al. ’s system (Pantel et al., 2007).</p><p>5 0.12057687 <a title="181-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Generating_Templates_of_Entity_Summaries_with_an_Entity-Aspect_Model_and_Pattern_Mining.html">125 acl-2010-Generating Templates of Entity Summaries with an Entity-Aspect Model and Pattern Mining</a></p>
<p>Author: Peng Li ; Jing Jiang ; Yinglin Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatic generation of summary templates from given collections of summary articles. This kind of summary templates can be useful in various applications. We first develop an entity-aspect LDA model to simultaneously cluster both sentences and words into aspects. We then apply frequent subtree pattern mining on the dependency parse trees of the clustered and labeled sentences to discover sentence patterns that well represent the aspects. Key features of our method include automatic grouping of semantically related sentence patterns and automatic identification of template slots that need to be filled in. We apply our method on five Wikipedia entity categories and compare our method with two baseline methods. Both quantitative evaluation based on human judgment and qualitative comparison demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our method.</p><p>6 0.10507488 <a title="181-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-SystemT%3A_An_Algebraic_Approach_to_Declarative_Information_Extraction.html">222 acl-2010-SystemT: An Algebraic Approach to Declarative Information Extraction</a></p>

<p>Author: Jochen Leidner ; Frank Schilder</p><p>Abstract: In the business world, analyzing and dealing with risk permeates all decisions and actions. However, to date, risk identification, the first step in the risk management cycle, has always been a manual activity with little to no intelligent software tool support. In addition, although companies are required to list risks to their business in their annual SEC filings in the USA, these descriptions are often very highlevel and vague. In this paper, we introduce Risk Mining, which is the task of identifying a set of risks pertaining to a business area or entity. We argue that by combining Web mining and Information Extraction (IE) techniques, risks can be detected automatically before they materialize, thus providing valuable business intelligence. We describe a system that induces a risk taxonomy with concrete risks (e.g., interest rate changes) at its leaves and more abstract risks (e.g., financial risks) closer to its root node. The taxonomy is induced via a bootstrapping algorithms starting with a few seeds. The risk taxonomy is used by the system as input to a risk monitor that matches risk mentions in financial documents to the abstract risk types, thus bridging a lexical gap. Our system is able to automatically generate company specific “risk maps”, which we demonstrate for a corpus of earnings report conference calls.</p><p>5 0.68833137 <a title="181-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Complexity_Assumptions_in_Ontology_Verbalisation.html">64 acl-2010-Complexity Assumptions in Ontology Verbalisation</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Power</p><p>Abstract: We describe the strategy currently pursued for verbalising OWL ontologies by sentences in Controlled Natural Language (i.e., combining generic rules for realising logical patterns with ontology-specific lexicons for realising atomic terms for individuals, classes, and properties) and argue that its success depends on assumptions about the complexity of terms and axioms in the ontology. We then show, through analysis of a corpus of ontologies, that although these assumptions could in principle be violated, they are overwhelmingly respected in practice by ontology developers.</p><p>6 0.66235614 <a title="181-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Learning_Word-Class_Lattices_for_Definition_and_Hypernym_Extraction.html">166 acl-2010-Learning Word-Class Lattices for Definition and Hypernym Extraction</a></p>

<p>Author: Adam Pauls ; Dan Klein ; Chris Quirk</p><p>Abstract: We propose a top-down algorithm for extracting k-best lists from a parser. Our algorithm, TKA∗ is a variant of the kbest A∗ (KA∗) algorithm of Pauls and Klein (2009). In contrast to KA∗, which performs an inside and outside pass before performing k-best extraction bottom up, TKA∗ performs only the inside pass before extracting k-best lists top down. TKA∗ maintains the same optimality and efficiency guarantees of KA∗, but is simpler to both specify and implement.</p><p>2 0.75782049 <a title="181-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Hierarchical_A%2A_Parsing_with_Bridge_Outside_Scores.html">131 acl-2010-Hierarchical A* Parsing with Bridge Outside Scores</a></p>
<p>Author: Adam Pauls ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Hierarchical A∗ (HA∗) uses of a hierarchy of coarse grammars to speed up parsing without sacrificing optimality. HA∗ prioritizes search in refined grammars using Viterbi outside costs computed in coarser grammars. We present Bridge Hierarchical A∗ (BHA∗), a modified Hierarchial A∗ algorithm which computes a novel outside cost called a bridge outside cost. These bridge costs mix finer outside scores with coarser inside scores, and thus constitute tighter heuristics than entirely coarse scores. We show that BHA∗ substantially outperforms HA∗ when the hierarchy contains only very coarse grammars, while achieving comparable performance on more refined hierarchies.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.73670459 <a title="181-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-On_Learning_Subtypes_of_the_Part-Whole_Relation%3A_Do_Not_Mix_Your_Seeds.html">181 acl-2010-On Learning Subtypes of the Part-Whole Relation: Do Not Mix Your Seeds</a></p>

<p>Author: Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: This paper establishes a connection between two apparently very different kinds of probabilistic models. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models are used as “topic models” to produce a lowdimensional representation of documents, while Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs) define distributions over trees. The paper begins by showing that LDA topic models can be viewed as a special kind of PCFG, so Bayesian inference for PCFGs can be used to infer Topic Models as well. Adaptor Grammars (AGs) are a hierarchical, non-parameteric Bayesian extension of PCFGs. Exploiting the close relationship between LDA and PCFGs just described, we propose two novel probabilistic models that combine insights from LDA and AG models. The first replaces the unigram component of LDA topic models with multi-word sequences or collocations generated by an AG.

Given an object-attribute pair, we discover and analyze attribute information for a set of comparable objects in order to infer the desired value. This allows us to approximate the desired numerical values even when no exact values can be found in the text. Our framework makes use of relation defining patterns and WordNet similarity information. First, we obtain from the Web and WordNet a list of terms similar to the given object. Then we retrieve attribute values for each term in this list, and information that allows us to compare different objects in the list and to infer the attribute value range. Finally, we combine the retrieved data for all terms from the list to select or approximate the requested value. We evaluate our method using automated question answering, WordNet enrichment, and comparison with answers given in Wikipedia and by leading search engines. In all of these, our framework provides a significant improvement.</p><p>6 0.55596191 <a title="181-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Learning_Arguments_and_Supertypes_of_Semantic_Relations_Using_Recursive_Patterns.html">160 acl-2010-Learning Arguments and Supertypes of Semantic Relations Using Recursive Patterns</a></p>

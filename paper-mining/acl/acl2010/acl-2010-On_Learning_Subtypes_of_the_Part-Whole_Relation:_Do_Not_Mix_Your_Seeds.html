Ontological studies mention several types of this relation. In this paper, we show that the traditional practice of initializing minimally-supervised algorithms with a single set that mixes seeds of different types fails to capture the wide variety of part-whole patterns and tuples.

</p><p>2 The results obtained with mixed seeds ultimately converge to one of the part-whole relation types. [sent-7, score-0.737]
</p><p>3 We also demonstrate that all the  different types of part-whole relations can still be discovered, regardless of the type characterized by the initializing seeds. [sent-8, score-0.404]
</p><p>4 The taxonomy of Keet and Artale (2008), for instance, distinguishes part-whole relations based on their transitivity, and on the semantic classes of entities they sub-categorize. [sent-14, score-0.286]
</p><p>5 Part-whole relations are also crucial for many information extraction (IE) tasks (Girju et al. [sent-15, score-0.202]
</p><p>6 (2006), have specifically targeted the discovery of part-whole relations from text. [sent-24, score-0.214]
</p><p>7 Furthermore, part-whole relations are de-facto benchmarks for evaluating the performance of general relation extraction systems (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006; Beamer et al. [sent-25, score-0.303]
</p><p>8 However, these relation extraction efforts have overlooked the ontological distinctions between the different types of part-whole relations. [sent-28, score-0.317]
</p><p>9 In this paper, we show that enforcing the onto-  logical distinctions between the different types of part-whole relations enable information extraction systems to capture a wider variety of both generic and specialised part-whole lexico-syntactic patterns and tuples. [sent-30, score-0.438]
</p><p>10 Are the patterns and tuples discovered when focusing on a specific part-whole relation type confined to that particular type? [sent-36, score-0.769]
</p><p>11 Are more distinct examples discovered when IE systems learn the individual part-whole relation types? [sent-39, score-0.208]
</p><p>12 To answer these questions, we bootstrapped a minimally-supervised relation extraction algorithm, based on Espresso (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006), with different seed-sets for the various types of part-whole relations, and analyzed the harvested tuples and patterns. [sent-43, score-0.735]
</p><p>13 2  Previous Work  Investigations on the part-whole relations span across many disciplines, such as conceptual mod-  eling (Artale et al. [sent-44, score-0.164]
</p><p>14 (1987), have been proposed to clarify the semantics of the different part-whole relations types across these various disciplines. [sent-47, score-0.217]
</p><p>15 Keet and Artale (2008) developed a formal taxonomy, distinguishing transitive mereological partwhole relations from intransitive meronymic ones. [sent-48, score-0.57]
</p><p>16 Meronymic relations identified are: 1) memberof, between a physical object (or role) and an aggregation, e. [sent-49, score-0.164]
</p><p>17 Mereological relations are: 1)involved-in, between a phase and a process, e. [sent-58, score-0.164]
</p><p>18 This taxonomy further discriminates between part-whole relation types by enforcing semantical selectional restrictions, in the form of DOLCE ontology (Gangemi et al. [sent-67, score-0.251]
</p><p>19 In NLP, information extraction (IE) techniques, for discovering part-whole relations from text have also been developed. [sent-69, score-0.202]
</p><p>20 (2006), lexical patterns expressing partwhole relations between WordNet concept pairs  are manually extracted from 20,000 sentences of the L. [sent-78, score-0.499]

</p><p>22 The Espresso algorithm (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006) achieves a precision of 80% in learning partwhole relations from the Acquaint (TREC-9) corpus of nearly 6M words. [sent-91, score-0.366]
</p><p>23 Despite the reasonable performance of the above IE systems in discov-  ering part-whole relations, they overlook the ontological distinctions between the different relation types. [sent-92, score-0.226]
</p><p>24 To distinguish between types of part-whole relations, we commit to the taxonomy of Keet and Artale (2008) (Keet’s taxonomy), which uses sound ontological formalisms to unambiguously discrimate the relation types. [sent-101, score-0.345]
</p><p>25 Also, this taxonomy classifies the various part-whole relations introduced in literature, including ontologically-motivated mereological relations and linguistically-motivated meronymic ones. [sent-102, score-0.672]

</p><p>29 Evaluation of the harvested relations to determine performance gain/loss, types of partwhole relations extracted, and distinct and unique patterns and tuples discovered. [sent-109, score-1.302]
</p><p>30 We parsed the English and Dutch corpora respectively with the Stanford3 (Klein and Manning, 2003) and the Alpino4 (van Noord, 2006) parsers, and formalized the relations between terms (entities) as dependency paths. [sent-120, score-0.191]
</p><p>31 Below, we show two dependency paths (1-b) and (2-b), respectively derived from English and Dutch Wikipedia sentences (1-a) and (2-a), and denoting the relations between sample-song, and alkalo¨ ıde-plant. [sent-128, score-0.256]
</p><p>32 Statistics on the number of tuples and patterns preserved after applying the frequency cut-off are given in Table 1. [sent-134, score-0.561]
</p><p>33 2 Information Extraction Algorithm As IE algorithm for extracting part-whole relations from our texts, we relied on Espresso, a minimally-supervised algorithm, as described by Pantel and Pennacchiotti (2006). [sent-136, score-0.164]
</p><p>34 Espresso extracts surface patterns connecting the seeds (tuples) in a corpus. [sent-156, score-0.726]
</p><p>35 The reliability of a pattern p, r(p), given a set of input tuples I, is computed using (3), as its average strength of association with each tuple,i, weighted by each tuple’s reliability, rι(i). [sent-157, score-0.503]

</p><p>37 The reliability of the initializing seeds is set to 1. [sent-165, score-0.763]
</p><p>38 The top-k most reliable patterns are selected to find new tuples. [sent-166, score-0.152]
</p><p>39 The reliability of each tuple i, rι(i) is computed according to (4), where P is the set of harvested patterns. [sent-167, score-0.239]
</p><p>40 The top-m most reliable tuples are used to infer new patterns. [sent-168, score-0.409]
</p><p>41 The recursive discovery of patterns from tuples and vice-versa is repeated until a threshold number of patterns and/or tuples have been extracted. [sent-171, score-1.15]
</p><p>42 In our implementation, we maintain the core of the original Espresso algorithm, which pertains to estimating the reliability of patterns and tuples. [sent-172, score-0.219]
</p><p>43 Another difference is that while Pantel and Pennacchiotti (2006) complement their small corpus with documents retrieved from the web, we only rely on patterns extracted from our (much larger) corpora. [sent-175, score-0.176]
</p><p>44 3 Seed Selection Initially,we selected seeds from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) (for English) and EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998) (for Dutch) to initialize the IE algorithm. [sent-179, score-0.551]
</p><p>45 The tuples sub-categorized by these patterns in the English texts were automatically6 typed to appropriate DOLCE ontology7 classes, corresponding to those employed by Keet and Artale for constraining the entity pairs participating in different types of partwhole relations. [sent-185, score-0.773]
</p><p>46 The types of part-whole relations instantiated by the tuples could then be determined based on their ontological classes. [sent-186, score-0.763]
</p><p>47 Separate sets of 20 tuples, with each set corresponding to a specific relation type in the taxonomy of Keet and Artale (Keet’s taxonomy), were then created. [sent-187, score-0.24]
</p><p>48 For example, the English Wikipedia tuple t1 =actor-cast was used as a seed to discover member-of partwhole relations since both its elements were typed to the SOCIAL OBJECT class of the DOLCE ontology, and according to Keet’s taxonomy, they instantiate a member-of relation. [sent-188, score-0.422]
</p><p>49 Seeds for extracting relations from the Dutch corpus were defined in a similar way, except that we manually deter-  mined their ontological classes based on the class glossary of DOLCE. [sent-189, score-0.258]
</p><p>50 Below, we only report on the member-of and sub-quantity-of meronymic relations, and on the located-in, contained-in and structural part-of mereological relations. [sent-190, score-0.293]
</p><p>51 We were unable to find sufficient seeds for the constituted-of meronymic 5We experimented with the suggested discounting factor for PMI, but were not able to improve over the accuracy scores reported later. [sent-191, score-0.683]
</p><p>52 Also, we did not experiment with the participates-in and involved-in relations since their lexical realizations in our corpora are sparse, and they contain at least one verbal argument, whereas we only targeted patterns connecting nomimals. [sent-202, score-0.394]
</p><p>53 Sample seeds, their corpus frequency, and the part-whole relation type they instantiate from the English (EN) and Dutch (NL)  corpora are illustrated in Table 2. [sent-203, score-0.198]
</p><p>54 Besides the five specialized seed-sets of 20 prototypical tuples for the aforementioned relations, we also defined a general set of mixed seeds, which combines four seeds from each of the specialized sets. [sent-204, score-1.239]
</p><p>55 4  Experiments and Evaluation  We initialized our IE algorithm with the seed-sets to extract part-whole relations from our corpora. [sent-205, score-0.213]
</p><p>56 That is, the 10 most reliable patterns inferred from the initial seeds are bootstrapped to induce 100 part-whole tuples. [sent-207, score-0.703]
</p><p>57 8710 Table 3: Precision for seed-sets representing specific types of part-whole relations (member-of, sub-quantity-of, contained-in, structural part-of and located-in), and for the general set composed of all types. [sent-217, score-0.263]
</p><p>58 1 Precision of Extracted Relations Two human judges manually evaluated the tuples extracted from the English and Dutch corpora per seed-set in each iteration of our algorithm. [sent-219, score-0.46]
</p><p>59 Tuples that unambiguously instantiated part-whole relations were considered true positives. [sent-220, score-0.207]
</p><p>60 The precision of the tuples discovered by the different seed-sets in the last iteration of our algorithm are in Table 3. [sent-223, score-0.517]
</p><p>61 These results reveal that the precision of harvested tuples varies depending on the part-whole relation type that the initializing seeds denote. [sent-224, score-1.425]
</p><p>62 Mereological seeds (cont, struct, locat sets) outperformed their meronymic counterparts (memb,  subq) in extracting relations with higher precision from the English texts. [sent-225, score-0.89]
</p><p>63 This could be attributed to their formal ontological grounding, making them less ambiguous than the linguistically-motivated meronymic relations (Keet, 2006; Keet and Artale, 2008). [sent-226, score-0.39]
</p><p>64 The precision variations were less discernible for tuples extracted from the Dutch corpus, although the best precision was still achieved with mereological located-in seeds. [sent-227, score-0.634]
</p><p>65 We also noticed that the precision of tuples extracted from both the English and Dutch corpora by the general set of mixed seeds was as high as the maximum precision obtained by the individual sets of specialized seeds over these two corpora, i. [sent-228, score-1.781]
</p><p>66 An evaluation of the patterns and tuples extracted indicated considerable precision drop between successive iterations of our algorithm. [sent-238, score-0.628]
</p><p>67 This appears to be due to semantic drift (McIntosh and Curran, 2009), where highly-ambiguous patterns promote incorrect tuples , which in turn, compound the precision loss. [sent-239, score-0.604]
</p><p>68 2 Types of Extracted Relations Initializing our algorithm with seeds of a particular type always led to the discovery of tuples characterizing other types of part-whole relations in the English corpus. [sent-241, score-1.247]
</p><p>69 “include”, generated regardless of the seeds’ types, and which are highy correlated with, and hence, trigger tuples denoting other part-whole relation types. [sent-244, score-0.58]
</p><p>70 An almost similar observation was made for the Dutch corpus,  except that tuples instantiating the member-of relation could only be learnt using initial seeds of that particular type (i. [sent-245, score-1.126]
</p><p>71 Thus, initializing our IE algorithm with seeds that instantiate relations other than member-of fails to detect these unique patterns, and fails to subsequently discover partwhole tuples describing the member-of relations. [sent-249, score-1.558]
</p><p>72 Our findings are illustrated in Table 4, where each cell lists a tuple of a particular type (column), which was harvested from seeds of a given type (row). [sent-250, score-0.829]
</p><p>73 3 Distinct Patterns and Tuples We address our third question by comparing the output of our algorithm to determine whether the results obtained by initializing with the individual specialized seeds were (dis)similar and/or distinct. [sent-253, score-0.783]
</p><p>74 Each result set consisted of maximally 520 tuples  (including 20 initializing seeds) and 15 lexicosyntactic patterns, obtained after five iterations. [sent-254, score-0.554]
</p><p>75 Tuples extracted from the English corpus using the member-of and contained-in seed-sets exhibited a high degree of similarity, with 465 common tuples discovered by both sets. [sent-255, score-0.498]
</p><p>76 These identical tuples were also assigned the same ranks (reliability) in the results generated by the memberof and contained-in seeds, with a Spearman rank correlation of 0. [sent-256, score-0.442]
</p><p>77 This convergence was also reflected in the fact that the member-of and contained-in seeds generated around 80% of common patterns. [sent-258, score-0.551]
</p><p>78 These patterns were mostly prototypical ones indicative of part-whole relations, such as WHOLE+nsubj ← include → dobj+PART (“include”) and+ +thnseuirb cognates involving passive forms and relative clauses. [sent-259, score-0.211]
</p><p>79 However, the specialized seeds also generated distinct patterns, like “joined as” and “released with” for the member-of and contained-in seeds respectively. [sent-260, score-1.231]
</p><p>80 The most distinct tuples and patterns were harvested with the sub-quantity-of, structural part-of,  and located-in seeds. [sent-261, score-0.783]
</p><p>81 Examining the patterns harvested by the sub-quantity-of, structural part-of, and located-in seeds revealed a high prominence of specialized and unique patterns, which specifically characterize these relations. [sent-263, score-0.995]
</p><p>82 Examples of such patterns include “made with”, “released with” and “found in”, which lexically realize the sub-quantity-of, structural part-of, and located-in relations respectively. [sent-264, score-0.416]
</p><p>83 For the Dutch corpus, the seeds that generated the most similar tuples were those corresponding to the sub-quantity-of, contained-in, and structural part-of relations, with 490 common tuples discovered, and a Spearman rank correlation in the range of 0. [sent-265, score-1.415]
</p><p>84 As expected, these seeds also led to the discovery of a substantial number of common and prototypical part-whole patterns. [sent-268, score-0.638]
</p><p>85 The most distinct results were harvested by the located-in and member-of seeds, with negative Spearman correlation scores between the output tuples indicating hardly any overlap. [sent-270, score-0.585]
</p><p>86 We also found out that the patterns harvested by the located-in and member-of seeds characteristically pertained to these relations. [sent-271, score-0.837]
</p><p>87 Example of such patterns include “ligt in” (“lie in”), “is gelegen in” (“is located in”), and “treedt toe tot” (“become member of”), respectively describing the located-in and member-of relations. [sent-272, score-0.181]
</p><p>88 Finally, instead of a single set that mixes seeds of different types, we created five such general sets by picking four different seeds from each of the specialized sets, and used them to initialize our algorithm. [sent-275, score-1.271]
</p><p>89 Based on these findings, we believe that the traditional practice of initializing IE algorithms with general sets that mix seeds denoting different partwhole relation types leads to inherently unstable results. [sent-277, score-1.124]
</p><p>90 As we have shown, the relations extracted by combining seeds ofheterogeneous types almost  always converge to one specific part-whole relation type, which cannot be conclusively predicted. [sent-278, score-0.932]
</p><p>91 Furthermore, general seeds are unable to capture the specific and distinct patterns that lexically realize the individual types of part-whole relations. [sent-279, score-0.852]
</p><p>92 5  Conclusions  In this paper, we have investigated the effect of ontologically-motivated distinctions in part-whole relations on IE systems that learn instances of these relations from text. [sent-280, score-0.359]
</p><p>93 We have shown that learning from specialized seeds-sets, denoting specific types of the partwhole relations, results in precision that is as high as or higher than the precision achieved with a general set that mixes seeds of different types. [sent-281, score-1.088]
</p><p>94 By comparing the outputs generated by different seed-sets, we observed that the tuples learnt with seeds denoting a specific part-whole relation type are not confined to that particular type. [sent-282, score-1.173]
</p><p>95 In most case, we are still able to discover tuples across all the different types of part-whole relations, regardless of the type instantiated by the initializing  seeds. [sent-283, score-0.725]
</p><p>96 Most importantly, we demonstrated that IE algorithms initialized with general sets of mixed seeds harvest results that tend to converge towards a specific type of part-whole relation. [sent-284, score-0.752]
</p><p>97 Conversely, when starting with seeds representing a specific type, it is likely to discover tuples and patterns that are completely distinct from those found by a mixed seed-set. [sent-285, score-1.233]
</p><p>98 Our results also illustrate that the outputs of IE algorithms are heavily influenced by the initializing seeds, concurring with the findings of McIntosh and Curran (2009). [sent-286, score-0.167]
</p><p>99 We believe that our results show a drastic form of this phenomenon: given a set of mixed seeds, denoting heterogeneous relations, the harvested tuples may converge towards any of the relations instantiated by the seeds. [sent-287, score-0.933]
</p><p>100 This instability strongly suggests that seeds instantiating different types of relations should not be mixed, partic1334  ularly when learning part-whole relations, which are characterized by many subtypes. [sent-289, score-0.791]

In this paper, we show that the traditional practice of initializing minimally-supervised algorithms with a single set that mixes seeds of different types fails to capture the wide variety of part-whole patterns and tuples. The results obtained with mixed seeds ultimately converge to one of the part-whole relation types.

<p>Author: Zornitsa Kozareva ; Eduard Hovy</p><p>Abstract: A challenging problem in open information extraction and text mining is the learning of the selectional restrictions of semantic relations. We propose a minimally supervised bootstrapping algorithm that uses a single seed and a recursive lexico-syntactic pattern to learn the arguments and the supertypes of a diverse set of semantic relations from the Web. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on multiple semantic relations expressed using “verb”, “noun”, and “verb prep” lexico-syntactic patterns. Humanbased evaluation shows that the accuracy of the harvested information is about 90%.

<p>Author: Xiao-Li Li ; Lei Zhang ; Bing Liu ; See-Kiong Ng</p><p>Abstract: Distributional similarity is a classic technique for entity set expansion, where the system is given a set of seed entities of a particular class, and is asked to expand the set using a corpus to obtain more entities of the same class as represented by the seeds. This paper shows that a machine learning model called positive and unlabeled learning (PU learning) can model the set expansion problem better. Based on the test results of 10 corpora, we show that a PU learning technique outperformed distributional similarity significantly. 1</p><p>4 0.11723489 <a title="181-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Weakly_Supervised_Learning_of_Presupposition_Relations_between_Verbs.html">258 acl-2010-Weakly Supervised Learning of Presupposition Relations between Verbs</a></p>
<p>Author: Galina Tremper</p><p>Abstract: Presupposition relations between verbs are not very well covered in existing lexical semantic resources. We propose a weakly supervised algorithm for learning presupposition relations between verbs that distinguishes five semantic relations: presupposition, entailment, temporal inclusion, antonymy and other/no relation. We start with a number of seed verb pairs selected manually for each semantic relation and classify unseen verb pairs. Our algorithm achieves an overall accuracy of 36% for type-based classification.</p><p>5 0.11111505 <a title="181-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Experiments_in_Graph-Based_Semi-Supervised_Learning_Methods_for_Class-Instance_Acquisition.html">109 acl-2010-Experiments in Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning Methods for Class-Instance Acquisition</a></p>
<p>Author: Partha Pratim Talukdar ; Fernando Pereira</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms have been successfully used to extract class-instance pairs from large unstructured and structured text collections. However, a careful comparison of different graph-based SSL algorithms on that task has been lacking. We compare three graph-based SSL algorithms for class-instance acquisition on a variety of graphs constructed from different domains. We find that the recently proposed MAD algorithm is the most effective. We also show that class-instance extraction can be significantly improved by adding semantic information in the form of instance-attribute edges derived from an independently developed knowledge base.

<p>Author: Jochen Leidner ; Frank Schilder</p><p>Abstract: In the business world, analyzing and dealing with risk permeates all decisions and actions. However, to date, risk identification, the first step in the risk management cycle, has always been a manual activity with little to no intelligent software tool support. In addition, although companies are required to list risks to their business in their annual SEC filings in the USA, these descriptions are often very highlevel and vague. In this paper, we introduce Risk Mining, which is the task of identifying a set of risks pertaining to a business area or entity. We argue that by combining Web mining and Information Extraction (IE) techniques, risks can be detected automatically before they materialize, thus providing valuable business intelligence. We describe a system that induces a risk taxonomy with concrete risks (e.g., interest rate changes) at its leaves and more abstract risks (e.g., financial risks) closer to its root node. The taxonomy is induced via a bootstrapping algorithms starting with a few seeds. The risk taxonomy is used by the system as input to a risk monitor that matches risk mentions in financial documents to the abstract risk types, thus bridging a lexical gap. Our system is able to automatically generate company specific “risk maps”, which we demonstrate for a corpus of earnings report conference calls.</p><p>5 0.67289197 <a title="181-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Experiments_in_Graph-Based_Semi-Supervised_Learning_Methods_for_Class-Instance_Acquisition.html">109 acl-2010-Experiments in Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning Methods for Class-Instance Acquisition</a></p>

In this paper, we present a methodology to automatically extend WordNet with large amounts of semantic relations from an encyclopedic resource, namely Wikipedia.

<p>Author: Mohit Bansal ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple but accurate parser which exploits both large tree fragments and symbol refinement. We parse with all fragments of the training set, in contrast to much recent work on tree selection in data-oriented parsing and treesubstitution grammar learning. We require only simple, deterministic grammar symbol refinement, in contrast to recent work on latent symbol refinement. Moreover, our parser requires no explicit lexicon machinery, instead parsing input sentences as character streams. Despite its simplicity, our parser achieves accuracies of over 88% F1 on the standard English WSJ task, which is competitive with substantially more complicated state-of-theart lexicalized and latent-variable parsers. Additional specific contributions center on making implicit all-fragments parsing efficient, including a coarse-to-fine inference scheme and a new graph encoding.</p><p>4 0.49839079 <a title="181-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Learning_to_Translate_with_Source_and_Target_Syntax.html">169 acl-2010-Learning to Translate with Source and Target Syntax</a></p>
<p>Author: David Chiang</p><p>Abstract: Statistical translation models that try to capture the recursive structure of language have been widely adopted over the last few years. These models make use of varying amounts of information from linguistic theory: some use none at all, some use information about the grammar of the target language, some use information about the grammar of the source language. But progress has been slower on translation models that are able to learn the relationship between the grammars of both the source and target language. We discuss the reasons why this has been a challenge, review existing attempts to meet this challenge, and show how some old and new ideas can be combined into a sim- ple approach that uses both source and target syntax for significant improvements in translation accuracy.</p><p>5 0.49826151 <a title="181-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Learning_Arguments_and_Supertypes_of_Semantic_Relations_Using_Recursive_Patterns.html">160 acl-2010-Learning Arguments and Supertypes of Semantic Relations Using Recursive Patterns</a></p>

<p>Author: Liang Huang ; Kenji Sagae</p><p>Abstract: Incremental parsing techniques such as shift-reduce have gained popularity thanks to their efficiency, but there remains a major problem: the search is greedy and only explores a tiny fraction of the whole space (even with beam search) as opposed to dynamic programming. We show that, surprisingly, dynamic programming is in fact possible for many shift-reduce parsers, by merging “equivalent” stacks based on feature values. Empirically, our algorithm yields up to a five-fold speedup over a state-of-the-art shift-reduce depen- dency parser with no loss in accuracy. Better search also leads to better learning, and our final parser outperforms all previously reported dependency parsers for English and Chinese, yet is much faster.</p><p>3 0.17723092 <a title="194-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Optimising_Information_Presentation_for_Spoken_Dialogue_Systems.html">187 acl-2010-Optimising Information Presentation for Spoken Dialogue Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Verena Rieser ; Oliver Lemon ; Xingkun Liu</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to Information Presentation (IP) in Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) using a data-driven statistical optimisation framework for content planning and attribute selection. First we collect data in a Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) experiment and use it to build a supervised model of human behaviour. This forms a baseline for measuring the performance of optimised policies, developed from this data using Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. We show that the optimised policies significantly outperform the baselines in a variety of generation scenarios: while the supervised model is able to attain up to 87.6% of the possible reward on this task, the RL policies are significantly better in 5 out of 6 scenarios, gaining up to 91.5% of the total possible reward. The RL policies perform especially well in more complex scenarios. We are also the first to show that adding predictive “lower level” features (e.g. from the NLG realiser) is important for optimising IP strategies according to user preferences. This provides new insights into the nature of the IP problem for SDS.</p><p>4 0.16186768 <a title="194-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Towards_Relational_POMDPs_for_Adaptive_Dialogue_Management.html">239 acl-2010-Towards Relational POMDPs for Adaptive Dialogue Management</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre Lison</p><p>Abstract: Open-ended spoken interactions are typically characterised by both structural complexity and high levels of uncertainty, making dialogue management in such settings a particularly challenging problem. Traditional approaches have focused on providing theoretical accounts for either the uncertainty or the complexity of spoken dialogue, but rarely considered the two issues simultaneously. This paper describes ongoing work on a new approach to dialogue management which attempts to fill this gap. We represent the interaction as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) over a rich state space incorporating both dialogue, user, and environment models. The tractability of the resulting POMDP can be preserved using a mechanism for dynamically constraining the action space based on prior knowledge over locally relevant dialogue structures. These constraints are encoded in a small set of general rules expressed as a Markov Logic network. The first-order expressivity of Markov Logic enables us to leverage the rich relational structure of the problem and efficiently abstract over large regions ofthe state and action spaces.</p><p>5 0.1462356 <a title="194-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Simple_Semi-Supervised_Training_of_Part-Of-Speech_Taggers.html">212 acl-2010-Simple Semi-Supervised Training of Part-Of-Speech Taggers</a></p>
<p>Author: Anders Sogaard</p><p>Abstract: Most attempts to train part-of-speech taggers on a mixture of labeled and unlabeled data have failed. In this work stacked learning is used to reduce tagging to a classification task. This simplifies semisupervised training considerably. Our prefered semi-supervised method combines tri-training (Li and Zhou, 2005) and disagreement-based co-training. On the Wall Street Journal, we obtain an error reduction of 4.2% with SVMTool (Gimenez and Marquez, 2004).</p><p>6 0.12864304 <a title="194-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Learning_to_Adapt_to_Unknown_Users%3A_Referring_Expression_Generation_in_Spoken_Dialogue_Systems.html">167 acl-2010-Learning to Adapt to Unknown Users: Referring Expression Generation in Spoken Dialogue Systems</a></p>

<p>Author: Ethan Selfridge ; Peter Heeman</p><p>Abstract: Current turn-taking approaches for spoken dialogue systems rely on the speaker releasing the turn before the other can take it. This reliance results in restricted interactions that can lead to inefficient dialogues. In this paper we present a model we refer to as Importance-Driven Turn-Bidding that treats turn-taking as a negotiative process. Each conversant bids for the turn based on the importance of the intended utterance, and Reinforcement Learning is used to indirectly learn this parameter. We find that Importance-Driven Turn-Bidding performs better than two current turntaking approaches in an artificial collaborative slot-filling domain. The negotiative nature of this model creates efficient dia- logues, and supports the improvement of mixed-initiative interaction.</p><p>3 0.69230962 <a title="194-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-Towards_Relational_POMDPs_for_Adaptive_Dialogue_Management.html">239 acl-2010-Towards Relational POMDPs for Adaptive Dialogue Management</a></p>

Resumption Strategies for an In-Vehicle Dialogue System</a></p>
<p>Author: Jessica Villing</p><p>Abstract: In-vehicle dialogue systems often contain more than one application, e.g. a navigation and a telephone application. This means that the user might, for example, interrupt the interaction with the telephone application to ask for directions from the navigation application, and then resume the dialogue with the telephone application. In this paper we present an analysis of interruption and resumption behaviour in human-human in-vehicle dialogues and also propose some implications for resumption strategies in an in-vehicle dialogue system.</p><p>5 0.60087866 <a title="194-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Decision_Detection_Using_Hierarchical_Graphical_Models.html">81 acl-2010-Decision Detection Using Hierarchical Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Trung H. Bui ; Stanley Peters</p><p>Abstract: We investigate hierarchical graphical models (HGMs) for automatically detecting decisions in multi-party discussions. Several types of dialogue act (DA) are distinguished on the basis of their roles in formulating decisions. HGMs enable us to model dependencies between observed features of discussions, decision DAs, and subdialogues that result in a decision. For the task of detecting decision regions, an HGM classifier was found to outperform non-hierarchical graphical models and support vector machines, raising the F1-score to 0.80 from 0.55.</p><p>6 0.594531 <a title="194-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Talking_NPCs_in_a_Virtual_Game_World.html">224 acl-2010-Talking NPCs in a Virtual Game World</a></p>

<p>Author: Hirotoshi Taira ; Sanae Fujita ; Masaaki Nagata</p><p>Abstract: Maintaining high annotation consistency in large corpora is crucial for statistical learning; however, such work is hard, especially for tasks containing semantic elements. This paper describes predicate argument structure analysis using transformation-based learning. An advantage of transformation-based learning is the readability of learned rules. A disadvantage is that the rule extraction procedure is time-consuming. We present incremental-based, transformation-based learning for semantic processing tasks. As an example, we deal with Japanese predicate argument analysis and show some tendencies of annotators for constructing a corpus with our method.</p><p>3 0.61120158 <a title="194-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Reading_between_the_Lines%3A_Learning_to_Map_High-Level_Instructions_to_Commands.html">202 acl-2010-Reading between the Lines: Learning to Map High-Level Instructions to Commands</a></p>
<p>Author: S.R.K. Branavan ; Luke Zettlemoyer ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the task of mapping high-level instructions to sequences of commands in an external environment. Processing these instructions is challenging—they posit goals to be achieved without specifying the steps required to complete them. We describe a method that fills in missing information using an automatically derived environment model that encodes states, transitions, and commands that cause these transitions to happen. We present an efficient approximate approach for learning this environment model as part of a policygradient reinforcement learning algorithm for text interpretation. This design enables learning for mapping high-level instructions, which previous statistical methods cannot handle.1</p><p>4 0.60756737 <a title="194-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Learning_to_Adapt_to_Unknown_Users%3A_Referring_Expression_Generation_in_Spoken_Dialogue_Systems.html">167 acl-2010-Learning to Adapt to Unknown Users: Referring Expression Generation in Spoken Dialogue Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Srinivasan Janarthanam ; Oliver Lemon</p><p>Abstract: We present a data-driven approach to learn user-adaptive referring expression generation (REG) policies for spoken dialogue systems. Referring expressions can be difficult to understand in technical domains where users may not know the technical ‘jargon’ names of the domain entities. In such cases, dialogue systems must be able to model the user’s (lexical) domain knowledge and use appropriate referring expressions. We present a reinforcement learning (RL) framework in which the sys- tem learns REG policies which can adapt to unknown users online. Furthermore, unlike supervised learning methods which require a large corpus of expert adaptive behaviour to train on, we show that effective adaptive policies can be learned from a small dialogue corpus of non-adaptive human-machine interaction, by using a RL framework and a statistical user simulation. We show that in comparison to adaptive hand-coded baseline policies, the learned policy performs significantly better, with an 18.6% average increase in adaptation accuracy. The best learned policy also takes less dialogue time (average 1.07 min less) than the best hand-coded policy. This is because the learned policies can adapt online to changing evidence about the user’s domain expertise.</p><p>5 0.59682673 <a title="194-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Active_Learning-Based_Elicitation_for_Semi-Supervised_Word_Alignment.html">24 acl-2010-Active Learning-Based Elicitation for Semi-Supervised Word Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Vamshi Ambati ; Stephan Vogel ; Jaime Carbonell</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised word alignment aims to improve the accuracy of automatic word alignment by incorporating full or partial manual alignments. Motivated by standard active learning query sampling frameworks like uncertainty-, margin- and query-by-committee sampling we propose multiple query strategies for the alignment link selection task. Our experiments show that by active selection of uncertain and informative links, we reduce the overall manual effort involved in elicitation of alignment link data for training a semisupervised word aligner.</p><p>6 0.59559387 <a title="194-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Towards_Relational_POMDPs_for_Adaptive_Dialogue_Management.html">239 acl-2010-Towards Relational POMDPs for Adaptive Dialogue Management</a></p>

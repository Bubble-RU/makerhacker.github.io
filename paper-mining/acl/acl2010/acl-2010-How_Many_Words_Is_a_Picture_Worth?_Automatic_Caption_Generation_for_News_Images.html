<p>Author: Ahmet Aker ; Robert Gaizauskas</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to automatic captioning of geo-tagged images by summarizing multiple webdocuments that contain information related to an image’s location. The summarizer is biased by dependency pattern models towards sentences which contain features typically provided for different scene types such as those of churches, bridges, etc. Our results show that summaries biased by dependency pattern models lead to significantly higher ROUGE scores than both n-gram language models reported in previous work and also Wikipedia baseline summaries. Summaries generated using dependency patterns also lead to more readable summaries than those generated without dependency patterns.</p><p>3 0.23442726 <a title="136-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-It_Makes_Sense%3A_A_Wide-Coverage_Word_Sense_Disambiguation_System_for_Free_Text.html">152 acl-2010-It Makes Sense: A Wide-Coverage Word Sense Disambiguation System for Free Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhi Zhong ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: Word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems based on supervised learning achieved the best performance in SensEval and SemEval workshops. However, there are few publicly available open source WSD systems. This limits the use of WSD in other applications, especially for researchers whose research interests are not in WSD. In this paper, we present IMS, a supervised English all-words WSD system. The flexible framework of IMS allows users to integrate different preprocessing tools, additional features, and different classifiers. By default, we use linear support vector machines as the classifier with multiple knowledge-based features. In our implementation, IMS achieves state-of-the-art results on several SensEval and SemEval tasks.</p><p>4 0.17003919 <a title="136-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Understanding_the_Semantic_Structure_of_Noun_Phrase_Queries.html">245 acl-2010-Understanding the Semantic Structure of Noun Phrase Queries</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiao Li</p><p>Abstract: Determining the semantic intent of web queries not only involves identifying their semantic class, which is a primary focus of previous works, but also understanding their semantic structure. In this work, we formally define the semantic structure of noun phrase queries as comprised of intent heads and intent modifiers. We present methods that automatically identify these constituents as well as their semantic roles based on Markov and semi-Markov conditional random fields. We show that the use of semantic features and syntactic features significantly contribute to improving the understanding performance.</p><p>5 0.16895978 <a title="136-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-A_Transition-Based_Parser_for_2-Planar_Dependency_Structures.html">20 acl-2010-A Transition-Based Parser for 2-Planar Dependency Structures</a></p>
<p>Author: Carlos Gomez-Rodriguez ; Joakim Nivre</p><p>Abstract: Finding a class of structures that is rich enough for adequate linguistic representation yet restricted enough for efficient computational processing is an important problem for dependency parsing. In this paper, we present a transition system for 2-planar dependency trees trees that can be decomposed into at most two planar graphs and show that it can be used to implement a classifier-based parser that runs in linear time and outperforms a stateof-the-art transition-based parser on four data sets from the CoNLL-X shared task. In addition, we present an efficient method – – for determining whether an arbitrary tree is 2-planar and show that 99% or more of the trees in existing treebanks are 2-planar.</p><p>6 0.12705059 <a title="136-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-A_Hybrid_Hierarchical_Model_for_Multi-Document_Summarization.html">8 acl-2010-A Hybrid Hierarchical Model for Multi-Document Summarization</a></p>

<p>Author: Jun'ichi Kazama ; Stijn De Saeger ; Kow Kuroda ; Masaki Murata ; Kentaro Torisawa</p><p>Abstract: Existing word similarity measures are not robust to data sparseness since they rely only on the point estimation of words’ context profiles obtained from a limited amount of data. This paper proposes a Bayesian method for robust distributional word similarities. The method uses a distribution of context profiles obtained by Bayesian estimation and takes the expectation of a base similarity measure under that distribution. When the context profiles are multinomial distributions, the priors are Dirichlet, and the base measure is . the Bhattacharyya coefficient, we can derive an analytical form that allows efficient calculation. For the task of word similarity estimation using a large amount of Web data in Japanese, we show that the proposed measure gives better accuracies than other well-known similarity measures.</p><p>3 0.64769614 <a title="136-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-Generating_Image_Descriptions_Using_Dependency_Relational_Patterns.html">124 acl-2010-Generating Image Descriptions Using Dependency Relational Patterns</a></p>

<p>Author: Asli Celikyilmaz ; Dilek Hakkani-Tur</p><p>Abstract: Scoring sentences in documents given abstract summaries created by humans is important in extractive multi-document summarization. In this paper, we formulate extractive summarization as a two step learning problem building a generative model for pattern discovery and a regression model for inference. We calculate scores for sentences in document clusters based on their latent characteristics using a hierarchical topic model. Then, using these scores, we train a regression model based on the lexical and structural characteristics of the sentences, and use the model to score sentences of new documents to form a summary. Our system advances current state-of-the-art improving ROUGE scores by ∼7%.

<p>Author: Steven Abney ; Steven Bird</p><p>Abstract: We present a grand challenge to build a corpus that will include all of the world’s languages, in a consistent structure that permits large-scale cross-linguistic processing, enabling the study of universal linguistics. The focal data types, bilingual texts and lexicons, relate each language to one of a set of reference languages. We propose that the ability to train systems to translate into and out of a given language be the yardstick for determining when we have successfully captured a language. We call on the computational linguistics community to begin work on this Universal Corpus, pursuing the many strands of activity described here, as their contribution to the global effort to document the world’s linguistic heritage before more languages fall silent.</p><p>2 0.97928935 <a title="136-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Online_Generation_of_Locality_Sensitive_Hash_Signatures.html">183 acl-2010-Online Generation of Locality Sensitive Hash Signatures</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin Van Durme ; Ashwin Lall</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by the recent interest in streaming algorithms for processing large text collections, we revisit the work of Ravichandran et al. (2005) on using the Locality Sensitive Hash (LSH) method of Charikar (2002) to enable fast, approximate comparisons of vector cosine similarity. For the common case of feature updates being additive over a data stream, we show that LSH signatures can be maintained online, without additional approximation error, and with lower memory requirements than when using the standard offline technique.</p><p>3 0.96323365 <a title="136-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Weakly_Supervised_Learning_of_Presupposition_Relations_between_Verbs.html">258 acl-2010-Weakly Supervised Learning of Presupposition Relations between Verbs</a></p>
<p>Author: Galina Tremper</p><p>Abstract: Presupposition relations between verbs are not very well covered in existing lexical semantic resources. We propose a weakly supervised algorithm for learning presupposition relations between verbs that distinguishes five semantic relations: presupposition, entailment, temporal inclusion, antonymy and other/no relation. We start with a number of seed verb pairs selected manually for each semantic relation and classify unseen verb pairs. Our algorithm achieves an overall accuracy of 36% for type-based classification.</p><p>4 0.959445 <a title="136-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Optimising_Information_Presentation_for_Spoken_Dialogue_Systems.html">187 acl-2010-Optimising Information Presentation for Spoken Dialogue Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Verena Rieser ; Oliver Lemon ; Xingkun Liu</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to Information Presentation (IP) in Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) using a data-driven statistical optimisation framework for content planning and attribute selection. First we collect data in a Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) experiment and use it to build a supervised model of human behaviour. This forms a baseline for measuring the performance of optimised policies, developed from this data using Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. We show that the optimised policies significantly outperform the baselines in a variety of generation scenarios: while the supervised model is able to attain up to 87.6% of the possible reward on this task, the RL policies are significantly better in 5 out of 6 scenarios, gaining up to 91.5% of the total possible reward. The RL policies perform especially well in more complex scenarios. We are also the first to show that adding predictive “lower level” features (e.g. from the NLG realiser) is important for optimising IP strategies according to user preferences. This provides new insights into the nature of the IP problem for SDS.</p><p>same-paper 5 0.94655073 <a title="136-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-How_Many_Words_Is_a_Picture_Worth%3F_Automatic_Caption_Generation_for_News_Images.html">136 acl-2010-How Many Words Is a Picture Worth?

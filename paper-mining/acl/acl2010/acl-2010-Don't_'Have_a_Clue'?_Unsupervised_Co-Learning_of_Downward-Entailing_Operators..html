<p>Author: Cigdem Toprak ; Niklas Jakob ; Iryna Gurevych</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a corpus of consumer reviews from the rateitall and the eopinions websites annotated with opinion-related information. We present a two-level annotation scheme. In the first stage, the reviews are analyzed at the sentence level for (i) relevancy to a given topic, and (ii) expressing an evaluation about the topic. In the second stage, on-topic sentences containing evaluations about the topic are further investigated at the expression level for pinpointing the properties (semantic orientation, intensity), and the functional components of the evaluations (opinion terms, targets and holders). We discuss the annotation scheme, the inter-annotator agreement for different subtasks and our observations.</p><p>3 0.074850984 <a title="92-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Generating_Focused_Topic-Specific_Sentiment_Lexicons.html">123 acl-2010-Generating Focused Topic-Specific Sentiment Lexicons</a></p>
<p>Author: Valentin Jijkoun ; Maarten de Rijke ; Wouter Weerkamp</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for automatically generating focused and accurate topicspecific subjectivity lexicons from a general purpose polarity lexicon that allow users to pin-point subjective on-topic information in a set of relevant documents. We motivate the need for such lexicons in the field of media analysis, describe a bootstrapping method for generating a topic-specific lexicon from a general purpose polarity lexicon, and evaluate the quality of the generated lexicons both manually and using a TREC Blog track test set for opinionated blog post retrieval. Although the generated lexicons can be an order of magnitude more selective than the general purpose lexicon, they maintain, or even improve, the performance of an opin- ion retrieval system.</p><p>4 0.069390438 <a title="92-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Identifying_Text_Polarity_Using_Random_Walks.html">141 acl-2010-Identifying Text Polarity Using Random Walks</a></p>
<p>Author: Ahmed Hassan ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: Automatically identifying the polarity of words is a very important task in Natural Language Processing. It has applications in text classification, text filtering, analysis of product review, analysis of responses to surveys, and mining online discussions. We propose a method for identifying the polarity of words. We apply a Markov random walk model to a large word relatedness graph, producing a polarity estimate for any given word. A key advantage of the model is its ability to accurately and quickly assign a polarity sign and magnitude to any word. The method could be used both in a semi-supervised setting where a training set of labeled words is used, and in an unsupervised setting where a handful of seeds is used to define the two polarity classes. The method is experimentally tested using a manually labeled set of positive and negative words. It outperforms the state of the art methods in the semi-supervised setting. The results in the unsupervised setting is comparable to the best reported values. However, the proposed method is faster and does not need a large corpus.</p><p>5 0.062960632 <a title="92-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-%22Was_It_Good%3F_It_Was_Provocative.%22_Learning_the_Meaning_of_Scalar_Adjectives.html">2 acl-2010-"Was It Good?

<p>Author: Marie-Catherine de Marneffe ; Christopher D. Manning ; Christopher Potts</p><p>Abstract: Texts and dialogues often express information indirectly. For instance, speakers’ answers to yes/no questions do not always straightforwardly convey a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer. The intended reply is clear in some cases (Was it good? It was great!) but uncertain in others (Was it acceptable? It was unprecedented.). In this paper, we present methods for interpreting the answers to questions like these which involve scalar modifiers. We show how to ground scalar modifier meaning based on data collected from the Web. We learn scales between modifiers and infer the extent to which a given answer conveys ‘yes’ or ‘no’ . To evaluate the methods, we collected examples of question–answer pairs involving scalar modifiers from CNN transcripts and the Dialog Act corpus and use response distributions from Mechanical Turk workers to assess the degree to which each answer conveys ‘yes’ or ‘no’ . Our experimental results closely match the Turkers’ response data, demonstrating that meanings can be learned from Web data and that such meanings can drive pragmatic inference.</p><p>6 0.060094312 <a title="92-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Assessing_the_Role_of_Discourse_References_in_Entailment_Inference.html">33 acl-2010-Assessing the Role of Discourse References in Entailment Inference</a></p>

<p>Author: David Vickrey ; Oscar Kipersztok ; Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel system that helps nonexperts find sets of similar words. The user begins by specifying one or more seed words. The system then iteratively suggests a series of candidate words, which the user can either accept or reject. Current techniques for this task typically bootstrap a classifier based on a fixed seed set. In contrast, our system involves the user throughout the labeling process, using active learning to intelligently explore the space of similar words. In particular, our system can take advantage of negative examples provided by the user. Our system combines multiple preexisting sources of similarity data (a standard thesaurus, WordNet, contextual similarity), enabling it to capture many types of similarity groups (“synonyms of crash,” “types of car,” etc.). We evaluate on a hand-labeled evaluation set; our system improves over a strong baseline by 36%.</p><p>5 0.53506267 <a title="92-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-%22Was_It_Good%3F_It_Was_Provocative.%22_Learning_the_Meaning_of_Scalar_Adjectives.html">2 acl-2010-"Was It Good?

<p>Author: Thomas Lavergne ; Olivier Cappe ; Francois Yvon</p><p>Abstract: Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are a widely-used approach for supervised sequence labelling, notably due to their ability to handle large description spaces and to integrate structural dependency between labels. Even for the simple linearchain model, taking structure into account implies a number of parameters and a computational effort that grows quadratically with the cardinality of the label set. In this paper, we address the issue of training very large CRFs, containing up to hun- dreds output labels and several billion features. Efficiency stems here from the sparsity induced by the use of a ‘1 penalty term. Based on our own implementation, we compare three recent proposals for implementing this regularization strategy. Our experiments demonstrate that very large CRFs can be trained efficiently and that very large models are able to improve the accuracy, while delivering compact parameter sets.</p><p>2 0.98703772 <a title="92-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Jointly_Optimizing_a_Two-Step_Conditional_Random_Field_Model_for_Machine_Transliteration_and_Its_Fast_Decoding_Algorithm.html">154 acl-2010-Jointly Optimizing a Two-Step Conditional Random Field Model for Machine Transliteration and Its Fast Decoding Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Dong Yang ; Paul Dixon ; Sadaoki Furui</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a joint optimization method of a two-step conditional random field (CRF) model for machine transliteration and a fast decoding algorithm for the proposed method. Our method lies in the category of direct orthographical mapping (DOM) between two languages without using any intermediate phonemic mapping. In the two-step CRF model, the first CRF segments an input word into chunks and the second one converts each chunk into one unit in the target language. In this paper, we propose a method to jointly optimize the two-step CRFs and also a fast algorithm to realize it. Our experiments show that the proposed method outper- forms the well-known joint source channel model (JSCM) and our proposed fast algorithm decreases the decoding time significantly. Furthermore, combination of the proposed method and the JSCM gives further improvement, which outperforms state-of-the-art results in terms of top-1 accuracy.</p><p>3 0.97708255 <a title="92-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Word_Representations%3A_A_Simple_and_General_Method_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">263 acl-2010-Word Representations: A Simple and General Method for Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Joseph Turian ; Lev-Arie Ratinov ; Yoshua Bengio</p><p>Abstract: If we take an existing supervised NLP system, a simple and general way to improve accuracy is to use unsupervised word representations as extra word features. We evaluate Brown clusters, Collobert and Weston (2008) embeddings, and HLBL (Mnih & Hinton, 2009) embeddings of words on both NER and chunking. We use near state-of-the-art supervised baselines, and find that each of the three word representations improves the accuracy of these baselines. We find further improvements by combining different word representations. You can download our word features, for off-the-shelf use in existing NLP systems, as well as our code, here: http ://metaoptimize com/proj ects/wordreprs/ .</p><p>4 0.96806931 <a title="92-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Talking_NPCs_in_a_Virtual_Game_World.html">224 acl-2010-Talking NPCs in a Virtual Game World</a></p>
<p>Author: Tina Kluwer ; Peter Adolphs ; Feiyu Xu ; Hans Uszkoreit ; Xiwen Cheng</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes the KomParse system, a natural-language dialog system in the three-dimensional virtual world Twinity. In order to fulfill the various communication demands between nonplayer characters (NPCs) and users in such an online virtual world, the system realizes a flexible and hybrid approach combining knowledge-intensive domainspecific question answering, task-specific and domain-specific dialog with robust chatbot-like chitchat.</p><p>5 0.95334566 <a title="92-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Detecting_Experiences_from_Weblogs.html">85 acl-2010-Detecting Experiences from Weblogs</a></p>
<p>Author: Keun Chan Park ; Yoonjae Jeong ; Sung Hyon Myaeng</p><p>Abstract: Weblogs are a source of human activity knowledge comprising valuable information such as facts, opinions and personal experiences. In this paper, we propose a method for mining personal experiences from a large set of weblogs. We define experience as knowledge embedded in a collection of activities or events which an individual or group has actually undergone. Based on an observation that experience-revealing sentences have a certain linguistic style, we formulate the problem of detecting experience as a classification task using various features including tense, mood, aspect, modality, experiencer, and verb classes. We also present an activity verb lexicon construction method based on theories of lexical semantics. Our results demonstrate that the activity verb lexicon plays a pivotal role among selected features in the classification perfor- , mance and shows that our proposed method outperforms the baseline significantly.</p><p>same-paper 6 0.92639792 <a title="92-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Don%27t_%27Have_a_Clue%27%3F_Unsupervised_Co-Learning_of_Downward-Entailing_Operators..html">92 acl-2010-Don't 'Have a Clue'?

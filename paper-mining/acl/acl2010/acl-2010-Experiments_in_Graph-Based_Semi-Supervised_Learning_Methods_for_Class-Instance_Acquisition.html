</p><p>3 1 Introduction Traditionally, named-entity recognition (NER) has focused on a small number of broad classes such as person, location, organization. [sent-8, score-0.126]
</p><p>4 However, those classes are too coarse to support important applications such as sense disambiguation, semantic matching, and textual inference in Web search. [sent-9, score-0.126]
</p><p>5 For those tasks, we need a much larger inventory of specific classes and accurate classification of terms into those classes. [sent-10, score-0.126]
</p><p>6 While supervised learning methods perform well for traditional NER, they are impractical for fine-grained classification because sufficient labeled data to train classifiers for all the classes is unavailable and would be very  expensive to obtain. [sent-11, score-0.147]
</p><p>7 Starting with a few seed instances for some classes, these methods, through analysis of unstructured text, extract new instances of the same class. [sent-18, score-0.126]
</p><p>8 We address this gap with a series of experiments comparing three graph-based SSL algorithms (Section 2) on graphs constructed from several sources (Metaweb Technologies, 2009; Banko et al. [sent-23, score-0.212]

</p><p>11 We demonstrate that instance-attribute edges significantly improve the accuracy of class-  instance extraction. [sent-28, score-0.068]
</p><p>12 In Section 2, we review three graph-based SSL algorithms that are compared for the classinstance acquisition task in Section 3. [sent-34, score-0.179]

</p><p>20 XYˆl>LYˆl = X Wuv(Yˆul −Yˆvl)2 Xl∈C  u,v∈XV,l∈C  From this, we observe that LP-ZGL penalizes any label assignment where two nodes connected by a highly weighted edge are assigned different labels. [sent-60, score-0.193]

</p><p>25 The main idea of Adsorption is to control label propagation more tightly by limiting the amount of information that passes through a node. [sent-73, score-0.075]
</p><p>26 For instance, Adsorption can reduce the importance of a high-degree node v during the label inference process by increasing pavbnd on that node. [sent-74, score-0.198]

</p><p>30 In case of MAD, the three random-walk probabilities, pivnj , pcvont, and pavbnd, defined by Adsorption on each node are folded inside the matrices S, , and R, respectively. [sent-102, score-0.161]
</p><p>31 3  Experiments  We now compare the experimental performance of the three graph-based SSL algorithms reviewed in the previous section, using graphs constructed from a variety of sources described below. [sent-107, score-0.235]
</p><p>32 , 2008), we use Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) as the evaluation metric in all experiments:  MRR =|Q1|vX∈Qr1v  (4)  where Q ⊆ V is the set of test nodes, and rv is the wranhekr oef Q Qthe ⊆ gold sl athbeel s among stth neo oldaebes,ls a assigned to node v. [sent-109, score-0.09]

</p><p>39 (b) The graph in part (a) augmented with an attribute node, has attribue:albums, along with the edges incident on it. [sent-128, score-0.342]
</p><p>40 This results is additional constraints for the nodes Johnny Cash and Bob Dylan to have similar labels (see Section 3. [sent-129, score-0.154]
</p><p>41 A table consists of one or more properties (column names) and their corresponding cell values (column entries). [sent-132, score-0.059]
</p><p>42 In this figure, Gender is a property in the table people-person, and Male is a corresponding cell value. [sent-134, score-0.12]
</p><p>43 We use the following process to convert the Freebase data tables into a single graph: •  •  •  Create a node for each unique cell value Create a node for each unique property name, wChreeartee unique property name pisr opbetratiyn nedam by prefixing the unique table ID to the property name.

</p><p>46 By applying this graph construction process on the first column of the two tables in Figure 1, we end up with the graph shown in Figure 2 (a). [sent-140, score-0.505]
</p><p>47 The topics in this subset were further filtered so that only cell-value nodes with frequency 10 or more were retained. [sent-145, score-0.086]
</p><p>48 We call the resulting graph Freebase-1 (see Table 1). [sent-146, score-0.221]
</p><p>49 From this set, we selected all classes which had more than 10 instances overlapping with the Freebase graph constructed above. [sent-150, score-0.478]
</p><p>50 This resulted in 23 classes, which along with their overlapping instances were used as the gold standard set for the experiments in this section. [sent-151, score-0.103]

</p><p>53 To evaluate how the algorithms scale up, we construct a larger graph from the same 18 domains as in Section 3. [sent-160, score-0.269]
</p><p>54 We shall call the resulting graph Freebase-2 (see Table 1). [sent-162, score-0.252]
</p><p>55 , 2007), that had more than 100 instances overlapping with the larger Freebase graph constructed above. [sent-164, score-0.352]
</p><p>56 This resulted in 192 WN classes which we use for the experiments in this section. [sent-165, score-0.147]
</p><p>57 The reason behind imposing such frequency constraints during class selection is to make sure that each class is left with a sufficient number of instances during testing. [sent-166, score-0.262]
</p><p>58 Experimental results comparing LP-ZGL, Adsorption, and MAD with 2 and 10 seeds per class are shown in Figure 4. [sent-167, score-0.266]
</p><p>59 A total of 292k test nodes were used for testing in the 10 seeds per class condition, showing that these methods can be applied to large datasets. [sent-168, score-0.352]
</p><p>60 It is interesting to note that MAD with 2 seeds per class outperforms LP-ZGL and adsorption even with 10 seeds per class. [sent-170, score-0.803]

</p><p>62 In contrast to graph construction from structured tables as in Sections 3. [sent-178, score-0.258]
</p><p>63 2, in this section  we use hypernym tuples extracted by TextRunner (Banko et al. [sent-180, score-0.063]
</p><p>64 To convert such a tuple into a graph, we create a node for the instance (http) and a node for the class (protocol), and then connect the nodes with two 1477  directed edges in both directions, with the extraction confidence (0. [sent-185, score-0.448]
</p><p>65 The graph created with this process from TextRunner output is called the TextRunner Graph (see Table 1). [sent-187, score-0.221]
</p><p>66 , 2007), which had more than 50 instances overlapping with the constructed graph. [sent-191, score-0.131]
</p><p>67 This resulted in 170 WordNet classes being used for the experiments in this section. [sent-192, score-0.147]
</p><p>68 Experimental results with 2 and 10 seeds per class are shown in Figure 5. [sent-193, score-0.266]
</p><p>69 4 Discussion If we correlate the graph statistics in Table 1 with the results of sections 3. [sent-196, score-0.221]
</p><p>70 3, we see that MAD is most effective for graphs with high average degree, that is, graphs where nodes tend to connect to many other nodes. [sent-199, score-0.262]
</p><p>71 For instance, the Freebase-1 graph has a high average degree of 29. [sent-200, score-0.244]
</p><p>72 Based on this, we suggest that average degree, an easily computable struc-  (Yˆ )  tural property of the graph, may be a useful indicator in choosing which graph-based SSL algorithm should be applied on a given graph. [sent-207, score-0.061]

</p><p>75 on a node, all classes except for the top scoring 15 classes were discarded. [sent-217, score-0.252]
</p><p>76 Without such sparsity constraints, a node in a connected graph will end up acquiring all the labels injected into the graph. [sent-218, score-0.411]
</p><p>77 In order to estimate the effect of such sparsity constraints, we varied the number of classes allowed per node from 5 to 45 on the graph and experimental setup of Figure 4, with 10 seeds per class. [sent-220, score-0.745]
</p><p>78 We observe that performance can vary significantly as the maximum number of classes allowed per node is changed, with the performance peaking at 25. [sent-222, score-0.297]
</p><p>79 This suggests that sparsity constraints during graph based SSL may have a crucial role to play, a question that needs further investigation. [sent-223, score-0.309]

</p><p>87 In particular, we experiment with the following type of constraint: two instances with a common attribute are likely to belong to the same class. [sent-241, score-0.151]
</p><p>88 For example, in Figure 2 (b), instances Johnny Cash and Bob Dylan are more likely to belong to the same class as they have a common attribute, albums. [sent-242, score-0.161]
</p><p>89 2), such constraints are naturally captured by the methods reviewed in Section 2. [sent-244, score-0.065]
</p><p>90 In Figure 7, we compare class-instance acquisition performance of the three graph-based SSL methods (Section 2) on the following three graphs (also see Table 1): TextRunner Graph: Graph constructed from the hypernym tuples extracted by TextRunner, as in Figure 5 (Section 3.

</p><p>92 In all experimental conditions with 2 and 10 seeds per class in Figure 7, we observe that the three methods consistently achieved the best performance on the TextRunner + YAGO graph. [sent-252, score-0.266]
</p><p>93 This suggests that addition of attribute based semantic constraints from YAGO to the TextRunner graph results in a better connected graph which in turn results in better inference by the graphbased SSL algorithms, compared to using either of the sources, i. [sent-253, score-0.609]
</p><p>94 Because of the label propagation behavior, graph-based SSL algorithms assign classes to all nodes reachable in the graph from at least one of the labeled instance nodes. [sent-261, score-0.599]
</p><p>95 This allows us to check the classes assigned to nodes corresponding to YAGO attributes in the TextRunner + YAGO graph, as shown in Table 2. [sent-262, score-0.259]

<p>Author: Fei Wu ; Daniel S. Weld</p><p>Abstract: Information-extraction (IE) systems seek to distill semantic relations from naturallanguage text, but most systems use supervised learning of relation-specific examples and are thus limited by the availability of training data. Open IE systems such as TextRunner, on the other hand, aim to handle the unbounded number of relations found on the Web. But how well can these open systems perform? This paper presents WOE, an open IE system which improves dramatically on TextRunner’s precision and recall. The key to WOE’s performance is a novel form of self-supervised learning for open extractors using heuris— tic matches between Wikipedia infobox attribute values and corresponding sentences to construct training data. Like TextRunner, WOE’s extractor eschews lexicalized features and handles an unbounded set of semantic relations. WOE can operate in two modes: when restricted to POS tag features, it runs as quickly as TextRunner, but when set to use dependency-parse features its precision and recall rise even higher.</p><p>3 0.12761152 <a title="109-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Learning_Arguments_and_Supertypes_of_Semantic_Relations_Using_Recursive_Patterns.html">160 acl-2010-Learning Arguments and Supertypes of Semantic Relations Using Recursive Patterns</a></p>
<p>Author: Zornitsa Kozareva ; Eduard Hovy</p><p>Abstract: A challenging problem in open information extraction and text mining is the learning of the selectional restrictions of semantic relations. We propose a minimally supervised bootstrapping algorithm that uses a single seed and a recursive lexico-syntactic pattern to learn the arguments and the supertypes of a diverse set of semantic relations from the Web. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on multiple semantic relations expressed using “verb”, “noun”, and “verb prep” lexico-syntactic patterns. Humanbased evaluation shows that the accuracy of the harvested information is about 90%.

<p>Author: Zornitsa Kozareva ; Eduard Hovy</p><p>Abstract: A challenging problem in open information extraction and text mining is the learning of the selectional restrictions of semantic relations. We propose a minimally supervised bootstrapping algorithm that uses a single seed and a recursive lexico-syntactic pattern to learn the arguments and the supertypes of a diverse set of semantic relations from the Web. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on multiple semantic relations expressed using “verb”, “noun”, and “verb prep” lexico-syntactic patterns. Humanbased evaluation shows that the accuracy of the harvested information is about 90%. We also compare our results with existing knowledge base to outline the similarities and differences of the granularity and diversity of the harvested knowledge.</p><p>4 0.5803321 <a title="109-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Learning_Better_Data_Representation_Using_Inference-Driven_Metric_Learning.html">161 acl-2010-Learning Better Data Representation Using Inference-Driven Metric Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Fei Wu ; Daniel S. Weld</p><p>Abstract: Information-extraction (IE) systems seek to distill semantic relations from naturallanguage text, but most systems use supervised learning of relation-specific examples and are thus limited by the availability of training data. Open IE systems such as TextRunner, on the other hand, aim to handle the unbounded number of relations found on the Web. But how well can these open systems perform? This paper presents WOE, an open IE system which improves dramatically on TextRunner’s precision and recall. The key to WOE’s performance is a novel form of self-supervised learning for open extractors using heuris— tic matches between Wikipedia infobox attribute values and corresponding sentences to construct training data. Like TextRunner, WOE’s extractor eschews lexicalized features and handles an unbounded set of semantic relations. WOE can operate in two modes: when restricted to POS tag features, it runs as quickly as TextRunner, but when set to use dependency-parse features its precision and recall rise even higher.</p><p>6 0.49938911 <a title="109-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Extraction_and_Approximation_of_Numerical_Attributes_from_the_Web.html">113 acl-2010-Extraction and Approximation of Numerical Attributes from the Web</a></p>

In this paper, a deep belief network is proposed to model the semantic relevance for question-answer pairs. Observing the textual similarity between the community-driven questionanswering (cQA) dataset and the forum dataset, we present a novel learning strategy to promote the performance of our method on the social community datasets without hand-annotating work. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the traditional approaches on both the cQA and the forum corpora.</p><p>4 0.74853516 <a title="109-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Open_Information_Extraction_Using_Wikipedia.html">185 acl-2010-Open Information Extraction Using Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Author: Mohit Bansal ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple but accurate parser which exploits both large tree fragments and symbol refinement. We parse with all fragments of the training set, in contrast to much recent work on tree selection in data-oriented parsing and treesubstitution grammar learning. We require only simple, deterministic grammar symbol refinement, in contrast to recent work on latent symbol refinement. Moreover, our parser requires no explicit lexicon machinery, instead parsing input sentences as character streams. Despite its simplicity, our parser achieves accuracies of over 88% F1 on the standard English WSJ task, which is competitive with substantially more complicated state-of-theart lexicalized and latent-variable parsers. Additional specific contributions center on making implicit all-fragments parsing efficient, including a coarse-to-fine inference scheme and a new graph encoding.</p><p>6 0.73604751 <a title="109-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Structural_Semantic_Relatedness%3A_A_Knowledge-Based_Method_to_Named_Entity_Disambiguation.html">218 acl-2010-Structural Semantic Relatedness: A Knowledge-Based Method to Named Entity Disambiguation</a></p>

</p><p>3 In this paper, we incorporate extra-linguistic information into an existing corpus-based reference resolution model, and investigate its effects on refer-  ence resolution problems within a corpus of Japanese dialogues. [sent-12, score-0.744]
</p><p>4 In these data sets, coreference relations are defined as a limited version of a typical coreference; this generally means that only the relations where expressions refer to the same named entities are addressed, because it makes the coreference resolution task more information extraction-oriented. [sent-25, score-0.637]
</p><p>5 They analysed the relations between referring expressions and the extra-linguistic information, and reported that the pronominal usage of referring expressions is predominant. [sent-34, score-1.044]
</p><p>6 Thus, a challenging issue in reference resolution is to create a model bridging a referring expression in the text and its object in the real world. [sent-36, score-1.003]
</p><p>7 We first explain the corpus of collaborative work dialogues in Section 2, and then present our approach for identifying a referent given a referring expression in situated dialogues in Section 3. [sent-49, score-0.898]
</p><p>8 2  REX-J corpus: a corpus of collaborative work dialogue  For investigating dialogue from the multi-modal perspective, researchers have developed data sets including extra-linguistic information, bridging objects in the world and their referring expressions. [sent-52, score-0.597]

</p><p>10 The relationship between a referring expression in a dialogue and its referent on a computer display is also annotated. [sent-62, score-0.739]
</p><p>11 The goal of the puzzle is to construct a given shape by arranging seven pieces of simple figures as shown in Figure 1. [sent-72, score-0.417]
</p><p>12 The precise position of every piece and every action that the participants make are recorded by the Tangram simulator in which the pieces on the computer display can be moved, rotated and flipped with simple mouse operations. [sent-73, score-0.932]
</p><p>13 The piece position and the mouse actions were recorded at intervals of 10 msec. [sent-74, score-0.464]
</p><p>14 The operator manipulates the pieces with the mouse according to the solver’s instructions. [sent-78, score-0.425]
</p><p>15 During this interaction, frequent uttering of referring expres-  sions are needed to distinguish the pieces of the puzzle. [sent-79, score-0.544]
</p><p>16 2 Statistics Table 1lists the syntactic and semantic features of the referring expressions in the corpus with their respective frequencies. [sent-82, score-0.522]
</p><p>17 This is because pronominal expressions are often used for pointing to a piece on a computer display. [sent-85, score-0.437]
</p><p>18 In the task of reference resolution, the reference resolution model has to identify a referent (i. [sent-89, score-0.815]
</p><p>19 In comparison to conventional problem settings for anaphora resolution, where the model searches for an antecedent out of a set of candidate antecedents from preceding utterances, expressions corresponding to antecedents are sometimes omitted because referring expressions are used as deixis (i.

</p><p>20 physically pointing to a piece on a computer display); they may also refer to a piece that has just been manipulated by an operator due to the temporal salience in a series of operations. [sent-94, score-0.729]
</p><p>21 For these reasons, even though the model checks all candidates in the preceding utterances, it may not find the antecedent  of a given referring expression. [sent-95, score-0.535]
</p><p>22 However, we do know that each referent exists as a piece on the display. [sent-96, score-0.385]
</p><p>23 We can therefore establish that when a referring expression is uttered by either a solver or an operator, the model can choose one of seven pieces as a referent of the current referring expression. [sent-97, score-1.237]
</p><p>24 1 Ranking model to identify referents To investigate the impact of extra-linguistic information on reference resolution, we conduct an em4In the current task on reference resolution, we deal only with referring expressions referring to a single piece to minimise complexity.

</p><p>27 As a basis for our reference resolution model, we adopt an existing model for reference resolution. [sent-103, score-0.663]
</p><p>28 Recently, machine learning-based approaches to reference resolution (Soon et al. [sent-104, score-0.459]
</p><p>29 These models for reference resolution take into account linguistic factors, such as relative salience of candidate antecedents, which have been modeled in Centering Theory (Grosz et al. [sent-107, score-0.576]
</p><p>30 In order to take advantage of existing models, we adopt the rankingbased approach as a basis for our reference resolution model. [sent-111, score-0.459]
</p><p>31 Each training instance is created from the set of all referents for each referring expression. [sent-118, score-0.433]
</p><p>32 To define the partial ranking of referents, we simply rank referents referred to by a given referring expression as first place and other referents as second place. [sent-119, score-0.75]
</p><p>33 2  Use of extra-linguistic information  Recent work on multi-modal reference resolution or referring expression generation (Prasov and Chai, 2008; Foster et al. [sent-121, score-0.899]
</p><p>34 , 2010) indicates that extra-linguistic information, such as eye-gaze and manipulation of objects, is 1261 Table 1: Referring expressions in REX-J corpus  one of essential clues for distinguishing deictic reference from endophoric reference. [sent-123, score-0.429]
</p><p>35 (2008) investigated the relationship of referring expressions and the manupluation of objects on a collaborative construction task, which is similar to our Tangram task5. [sent-126, score-0.565]
</p><p>36 They reported about 36% of the initial mentioned referring expressions in their corpus were involved with participant’s operations of objects, such as mouse manipulation. [sent-127, score-0.739]
</p><p>37 From these background, in addition to the information about the history of the preceding dis-  course, which has been used in previous machine learning-based approaches, we integrate extralinguistic information into the reference resolution model shown in Section 3. [sent-128, score-0.824]
</p><p>38 More precisely, we introduce the following extra-linguistic information: the information with regards to the history of a piece’s movement and the mouse cursor positions, and the information of the piece currently manipulated by an operator. [sent-130, score-0.941]
</p><p>39 1 Discourse history features First, ‘type of’ features are acquired from the expressions of a given referring expression and its antecedent in the preceding discourse if the an5Note that the task defined in Foster et al. [sent-135, score-1.097]
</p><p>40 These features have been examined by approaches to anaphora or  coreference resolution (Soon et al. [sent-139, score-0.549]
</p><p>41 To capture the textual aspect of dialogues for solving Tangram puzzle, we exploit the features such as a binary value indicating whether a referring expression has no antecedent in the preceding discourse and case markers following a candidate antecedent. [sent-142, score-1.144]
</p><p>42 2  Action history features  The history of the operations may yield important clues that indicate the salience in terms of the temporal recency of a piece within a series of operations. [sent-145, score-0.945]
</p><p>43 a piece in the Tangram puzzle) since the mouse cursor was moved over it. [sent-148, score-0.605]
</p><p>44 3  Current operation features  The recency of operations of a piece is also an im-  portant factor on reference resolution because it is directly associated with the focus of attention in terms of the cognition in a series of operations. [sent-152, score-0.986]
</p><p>45 For example, since a piece which was most recently manipulated is most salient from cognitive perspectives, it might be expected that the piece tends to be referred to by unmarked referring expressions such as pronouns. [sent-153, score-1.13]
</p><p>46 To incorporate such clues into the reference resolution model, we can use, for example, the time distance of a candidate referent since it was last manipulated in the preceding utterances. [sent-154, score-0.956]
</p><p>47 1262  (a) DH1 : yes, DH2 : yes, DH3 : yes, DH4 : yes, DH5 : yes, DH6 : yes, DH7 : yes, DH8 : yes, DH9 : yes, DH10 : yes,  Table 2: Feature set Discourse history features noa binary value indicating that P is referred to by the most recent referring expression. [sent-156, score-0.908]
</p><p>48 no a binary value indicating that the time distance to the last mention of P is more than 10 sec and less than or equal to 20 sec. [sent-158, score-0.412]
</p><p>49 no a binary value indicating that P has never been referred to by any mentions in the preceding utterances. [sent-160, score-0.376]
</p><p>50 no a binary value indicating that R is a pronoun and the most recent reference to P is not a pronoun. [sent-164, score-0.538]
</p><p>51 no a binary value indicating that R is not a pronoun and was most recently referred to by a pronoun. [sent-165, score-0.447]
</p><p>52 (b) Action history features AH1 : yes, noa binary value indicating that the mouse cursor was over P at the beginning of uttering R. [sent-166, score-0.947]
</p><p>53 AH2 : yes, no a binary value indicating that P is the last piece that the mouse cursor was over when feature AH1 is ‘no’ . [sent-167, score-0.844]
</p><p>54 AH3 : yes, no a binary value indicating that the time distance is less than or equal to 10 sec after the mouse cursor was over P. [sent-168, score-0.784]
</p><p>55 AH4 : yes, no a binary value indicating that the time distance is more than 10 sec and less than or equal to 20 sec after the mouse cursor was over P. [sent-169, score-0.886]
</p><p>56 AH5 : yes, no a binary value indicating that the time distance is more than 20 sec after the mouse cursor was over P. [sent-170, score-0.754]
</p><p>57 AH6 : yes, no a binary value indicating that the mouse cursor was never over P in the preceding utterances. [sent-171, score-0.7]
</p><p>58 (c) Current operation features CO1 : yes, noa binary value indicating that P is being manipulated at the beginning of uttering R. [sent-172, score-0.579]
</p><p>59 CO2 : yes, no a binary value indicating that P is the most recently manipulated piece when feature CO1 is ‘no’ . [sent-173, score-0.616]
</p><p>60 CO3 : yes, no a binary value indicating that the time distance is less than or equal to 10 sec after P was most recently manipulated. [sent-174, score-0.447]

</p><p>64 2, the feature testing whether a referring expression is a pronoun or not is crucial because it is directly related to the ‘deictic’ usage of referring expressions, whereas other expressions tend to refer to an expression appearing in the preceding utterances. [sent-184, score-1.27]
</p><p>65 Therefore, focusing on the difference of the pronominal usage of referring expressions, we separately create the reference resolution models;  one is for identifying a referent of a given pronoun, and the other is for all other expressions. [sent-188, score-1.043]
</p><p>66 At the training phase, we use only training instances whose referring expressions are pronouns for creating the pronoun model, and all other training instances are used for the nonpronoun model. [sent-190, score-0.676]
</p><p>67 The model using one of these models depending on the referring expression to be solved is called the separate model. [sent-191, score-0.47]
</p><p>68 2 Experimental setting We used 40 dialogues in the REX-J corpus6, containing 2,048 referring expressions. [sent-195, score-0.441]
</p><p>69 To facilitate the experiments, we conduct 10-fold crossvalidation using 2,035 referring expressions, each of which refers to a single piece in a computer dis-  6Spanger et al. [sent-196, score-0.565]
</p><p>70 In particular, it indicates that exploiting the action history features are significantly useful for reference resolution in this data set. [sent-223, score-0.81]
</p><p>71 Second, we can also see the impact of extralinguistic information (especially, the action history features) with regards to the pronoun and non-pronoun models. [sent-224, score-0.523]
</p><p>72 The difference may be caused by the fact that pronouns are more sensitive to the usage of the action history features because pronouns are often uttered as deixis (i. [sent-227, score-0.643]
</p><p>73 The results also show that the model using the discourse history and action history features achieved better performance than the model using all the features. [sent-230, score-0.655]
</p><p>74 This may be due to the duplicated definitions between the action history and current 7The remaining 13 instances referred to either more than one piece or a class of pieces, thus were excluded in this ex-  periment. [sent-231, score-0.582]

</p><p>77 9%) ‘# all REs’ stands for the frequency of referring expressions uttered in the corpus and ‘# on-mouse’ is the frequency of referring expressions in the situation when a referring expression is uttered and a mouse cursor is over the piece referred to by the expression. [sent-248, score-2.185]
</p><p>78 This demonstrates that in the pronoun model the action history features have the highest weight, while with the non-pronoun model these features are less significant. [sent-253, score-0.586]
</p><p>79 As we can see in Table 5, pronouns  are strongly related to the situation where a mouse cursor is over a piece, directly causing the weights of the features associated with the ‘on-mouse’ situation to become higher than other features. [sent-254, score-0.561]
</p><p>80 On the other hand, in the non-pronoun model, the discourse history features, such as DH6 and DH2, are the most significant, indicating that the compatibility of the attributes of a piece and a referring expression is more crucial than other action history and current operation features. [sent-255, score-1.438]
</p><p>81 This is compatible with the previous research concerning textual reference resolution (Mitkov, 2002). [sent-256, score-0.459]

<p>Author: Raquel Hervas ; Mark Finlayson</p><p>Abstract: Generating referring expressions is a key step in Natural Language Generation. Researchers have focused almost exclusively on generating distinctive referring expressions, that is, referring expressions that uniquely identify their intended referent. While undoubtedly one of their most important functions, referring expressions can be more than distinctive. In particular, descriptive referring expressions those that provide additional information not required for distinction are critical to flu– – ent, efficient, well-written text. We present a corpus analysis in which approximately one-fifth of 7,207 referring expressions in 24,422 words ofnews and narrative are descriptive. These data show that if we are ever to fully master natural language generation, especially for the genres of news and narrative, researchers will need to devote more attention to understanding how to generate descriptive, and not just distinctive, referring expressions. 1 A Distinctive Focus Generating referring expressions is a key step in Natural Language Generation (NLG). From early treatments in seminal papers by Appelt (1985) and Reiter and Dale (1992) to the recent set of Referring Expression Generation (REG) Challenges (Gatt et al., 2009) through different corpora available for the community (Eugenio et al., 1998; van Deemter et al., 2006; Viethen and Dale, 2008), generating referring expressions has become one of the most studied areas of NLG. Researchers studying this area have, almost without exception, focused exclusively on how to generate distinctive referring expressions, that is, referring expressions that unambiguously idenMark Alan Finlayson Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge, MA, 02139 USA markaf@mit .edu tify their intended referent. Referring expressions, however, may be more than distinctive. It is widely acknowledged that they can be used to achieve multiple goals, above and beyond distinction. Here we focus on descriptive referring expressions, that is, referring expressions that are not only distinctive, but provide additional information not required for identifying their intended referent. Consider the following text, in which some of the referring expressions have been underlined: Once upon a time there was a man, who had three daughters. They lived in a house and their dresses were made of fabric. While a bit strange, the text is perfectly wellformed. All the referring expressions are distinctive, in that we can properly identify the referents of each expression. But the real text, the opening lines to the folktale The Beauty and the Beast, is actually much more lyrical: Once upon a time there was a rich merchant, who had three daughters. They lived in a very fine house and their gowns were made of the richest fabric sewn with jewels. All the boldfaced portions namely, the choice of head nouns, the addition of adjectives, the use of appositive phrases serve to perform a descriptive function, and, importantly, are all unnecessary for distinction! In all of these cases, the author is using the referring expressions as a vehicle for communicating information about the referents. This descriptive information is sometimes – – new, sometimes necessary for understanding the text, and sometimes just for added flavor. But when the expression is descriptive, as opposed to distinctive, this additional information is not required for identifying the referent of the expression, and it is these sorts of referring expressions that we will be concerned with here. 49 Uppsala,P Srwoce de dni,n 1g1s- 1of6 t Jhuely AC 20L1 20 .1 ?0c 2 C0o1n0fe Aresnsoceci Sathio rnt f Poarp Ceorsm,p paugteastio 4n9a–l5 L4i,nguistics Although these sorts of referring expression have been mostly ignored by researchers in this area1 , we show in this corpus study that descriptive expressions are in fact quite prevalent: nearly one-fifth of referring expressions in news and narrative are descriptive. In particular, our data, the trained judgments of native English speakers, show that 18% of all distinctive referring expressions in news and 17% of those in narrative folktales are descriptive. With this as motivation, we argue that descriptive referring expressions must be studied more carefully, especially as the field progresses from referring in a physical, immediate context (like that in the REG Challenges) to generating more literary forms of text. 2 Corpus Annotation This is a corpus study; our procedure was therefore to define our annotation guidelines (Section 2.1), select texts to annotate (2.2), create an annotation tool for our annotators (2.3), and, finally, train annotators, have them annotate referring expressions’ constituents and function, and then adjudicate the double-annotated texts into a gold standard (2.4). 2.1 Definitions We wrote an annotation guide explaining the difference between distinctive and descriptive referring expressions. We used the guide when training annotators, and it was available to them while annotating. With limited space here we can only give an outline of what is contained in the guide; for full details see (Finlayson and Herv a´s, 2010a). Referring Expressions We defined referring expressions as referential noun phrases and their coreferential expressions, e.g., “John kissed Mary. She blushed.”. This included referring expressions to generics (e.g., “Lions are fierce”), dates, times, and numbers, as well as events if they were referred to using a noun phrase. We included in each referring expression all the determiners, quantifiers, adjectives, appositives, and prepositional phrases that syntactically attached to that expression. When referring expressions were nested, all the nested referring expressions were also marked separately. Nuclei vs. Modifiers In the only previous corpus study of descriptive referring expressions, on 1With the exception of a small amount of work, discussed in Section 4. museum labels, Cheng et al. (2001) noted that descriptive information is often integrated into referring expressions using modifiers to the head noun. To study this, and to allow our results to be more closely compared with Cheng’s, we had our annotators split referring expressions into their constituents, portions called either nuclei or modifiers. The nuclei were the portions of the referring expression that performed the ‘core’ referring function; the modifiers were those portions that could be varied, syntactically speaking, independently of the nuclei. Annotators then assigned a distinctive or descriptive function to each constituent, rather than the referring expression as a whole. Normally, the nuclei corresponded to the head of the noun phrase. In (1), the nucleus is the token king, which we have here surrounded with square brackets. The modifiers, surrounded by parentheses, are The and old. (1) (The) (old) [king] was wise. Phrasal modifiers were marked as single modifiers, for example, in (2). (2) (The) [roof] (of the house) collapsed. It is significant that we had our annotators mark and tag the nuclei of referring expressions. Cheng and colleagues only mentioned the possibility that additional information could be introduced in the modifiers. However, O’Donnell et al. (1998) observed that often the choice of head noun can also influence the function of a referring expression. Consider (3), in which the word villain is used to refer to the King. (3) The King assumed the throne today. I ’t trust (that) [villain] one bit. don The speaker could have merely used him to refer to the King–the choice of that particular head noun villain gives us additional information about the disposition of the speaker. Thus villain is descriptive. Function: Distinctive vs. Descriptive As already noted, instead of tagging the whole referring expression, annotators tagged each constituent (nuclei and modifiers) as distinctive or descriptive. The two main tests for determining descriptiveness were (a) if presence of the constituent was unnecessary for identifying the referent, or (b) if 50 the constituent was expressed using unusual or ostentatious word choice. If either was true, the constituent was considered descriptive; otherwise, it was tagged as distinctive. In cases where the constituent was completely irrelevant to identifying the referent, it was tagged as descriptive. For example, in the folktale The Princess and the Pea, from which (1) was extracted, there is only one king in the entire story. Thus, in that story, the king is sufficient for identification, and therefore the modifier old is descriptive. This points out the importance of context in determining distinctiveness or descriptiveness; if there had been a roomful of kings, the tags on those modifiers would have been reversed. There is some question as to whether copular predicates, such as the plumber in (4), are actually referring expressions. (4) John is the plumber Our annotators marked and tagged these constructions as normal referring expressions, but they added an additional flag to identify them as copular predicates. We then excluded these constructions from our final analysis. Note that copular predicates were treated differently from appositives: in appositives the predicate was included in the referring expression, and in most cases (again, depending on context) was marked descriptive (e.g., John, the plumber, slept.). 2.2 Text Selection Our corpus comprised 62 texts, all originally written in English, from two different genres, news and folktales. We began with 30 folktales of different sizes, totaling 12,050 words. These texts were used in a previous work on the influence of dialogues on anaphora resolution algorithms (Aggarwal et al., 2009); they were assembled with an eye toward including different styles, different authors, and different time periods. Following this, we matched, approximately, the number of words in the folktales by selecting 32 texts from Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993). These texts were selected at ran- dom from the first 200 texts in the corpus. 2.3 The Story Workbench We used the Story Workbench application (Finlayson, 2008) to actually perform the annotation. The Story Workbench is a semantic annotation program that, among other things, includes the ability to annotate referring expressions and coreferential relationships. We added the ability to annotate nuclei, modifiers, and their functions by writing a workbench “plugin” in Java that could be installed in the application. The Story Workbench is not yet available to the public at large, being in a limited distribution beta testing phase. The developers plan to release it as free software within the next year. At that time, we also plan to release our plugin as free, downloadable software. 2.4 Annotation & Adjudication The main task of the study was the annotation of the constituents of each referring expression, as well as the function (distinctive or descriptive) of each constituent. The system generated a first pass of constituent analysis, but did not mark functions. We hired two native English annotators, neither of whom had any linguistics background, who corrected these automatically-generated constituent analyses, and tagged each constituent as descriptive or distinctive. Every text was annotated by both annotators. Adjudication of the differences was conducted by discussion between the two annotators; the second author moderated these discussions and settled irreconcilable disagreements. We followed a “train-as-you-go” paradigm, where there was no distinct training period, but rather adjudication proceeded in step with annotation, and annotators received feedback during those sessions. We calculated two measures of inter-annotator agreement: a kappa statistic and an f-measure, shown in Table 1. All of our f-measures indicated that annotators agreed almost perfectly on the location of referring expressions and their breakdown into constituents. These agreement calculations were performed on the annotators’ original corrected texts. All the kappa statistics were calculated for two tags (nuclei vs. modifier for the constituents, and distinctive vs. descriptive for the functions) over both each token assigned to a nucleus or modifier and each referring expression pair. Our kappas indicate moderate to good agreement, especially for the folktales. These results are expected because of the inherent subjectivity of language. During the adjudication sessions it became clear that different people do not consider the same information 51 as obvious or descriptive for the same concepts, and even the contexts deduced by each annotators from the texts were sometimes substantially different. 3 Results Table 2 lists the primary results of the study. We considered a referring expression descriptive if any of its constituents were descriptive. Thus, 18% of the referring expressions in the corpus added additional information beyond what was required to unambiguously identify their referent. The results were similar in both genres.

Like Cheng’s results, our analysis shows that descriptive referring expressions make up a significant fraction of all referring expressions. Although Cheng did not examine nuclei, our results show that the use of descriptive nuclei is small but not negligible. 4 Relation to the Field Researchers working on generating referring expressions typically acknowledge that referring expressions can perform functions other than distinction. Despite this widespread acknowledgment, researchers have, for the most part, explicitly ignored these functions. Exceptions to this trend Tales Articles Total Nuclei3,6663,5027,168 Max. Nuc/Ref Dist.

Second and third are corpus studies by Cheng et al. (2001) and Jordan (2000a) that bear on the prevalence of descriptive referring expressions. The NLG subtask of aggregation can be used to imbue referring expressions with a descriptive function (Reiter and Dale, 2000, §5.3). There is a specific nk (iRned otefr aggregation 0c0al0le,d § embedding t ihsa at moves information from one clause to another inside the structure of a separate noun phrase. This type of aggregation can be used to transform two sentences such as “The princess lived in a castle. She was pretty ” into “The pretty princess lived in a castle ”. The adjective pretty, previously a cop- ular predicate, becomes a descriptive modifier of the reference to the princess, making the second text more natural and fluent. This kind of aggregation is widely used by humans for making the discourse more compact and efficient. In order to create NLG systems with this ability, we must take into account the caveat, noted by Cheng (1998), that any non-distinctive information in a referring expression must not lead to confusion about the distinctive function of the referring expression. This is by no means a trivial problem this sort of aggregation interferes with referring and coherence planning at both a local and global level (Cheng and Mellish, 2000; Cheng et al., 2001). It is clear, from the current state of the art of NLG, that we have not yet obtained a deep enough understanding of aggregation to enable us to handle these interactions. More research on the topic is needed. Two previous corpus studies have looked at the use of descriptive referring expressions. The first showed explicitly that people craft descriptive referring expressions to accomplish different – 52 goals. Jordan and colleagues (Jordan, 2000b; Jordan, 2000a) examined the use of referring expressions using the COCONUT corpus (Eugenio et al., 1998). They tested how domain and discourse goals can influence the content of non-pronominal referring expressions in a dialogue context, checking whether or not a subject’s goals led them to include non-referring information in a referring expression. Their results are intriguing because they point toward heretofore unexamined constraints, utilities and expectations (possibly genre- or styledependent) that may underlie the use ofdescriptive information to perform different functions, and are not yet captured by aggregation modules in particular or NLG systems in general. In the other corpus study, which partially inspired this work, Cheng and colleagues analyzed a set of museum descriptions, the GNOME corpus (Poesio, 2004), for the pragmatic functions of referring expressions. They had three functions in their study, in contrast to our two. Their first function (marked by their uniq tag) was equiv- alent to our distinctive function. The other two were specializations of our descriptive tag, where they differentiated between additional information that helped to understand the text (int), or additional information not necessary for understanding (att r). Despite their annotators seeming to have trouble distinguishing between the latter two tags, they did achieve good overall inter-annotator agreement. They identified 1,863 modifiers to referring expressions in their corpus, of which 47.3% fulfilled a descriptive (att r or int) function. This is supportive of our main assertion, namely, that descriptive referring expressions, not only crucial for efficient and fluent text, are actually a significant phenomenon. It is interesting, though, that Cheng’s fraction of descriptive referring expression was so much higher than ours (47.3% versus our 18%). We attribute this substantial difference to genre, in that Cheng studied museum labels, in which the writer is spaceconstrained, having to pack a lot of information into a small label. The issue bears further study, and perhaps will lead to insights into differences in writing style that may be attributed to author or genre. 5 Contributions We make two contributions in this paper. First, we assembled, double-annotated, and adjudicated into a gold-standard a corpus of 24,422 words. We marked all referring expressions, coreferential relations, and referring expression constituents, and tagged each constituent as having a descriptive or distinctive function. We wrote an annotation guide and created software that allows the annotation of this information in free text. The corpus and the guide are available on-line in a permanent digital archive (Finlayson and Herv a´s, 2010a; Finlayson and Herv a´s, 2010b). The software will also be released in the same archive when the Story Workbench annotation application is released to the public. This corpus will be useful for the automatic generation and analysis of both descriptive and distinctive referring expressions. Any kind of system intended to generate text as humans do must take into account that identifica- tion is not the only function of referring expressions. Many analysis applications would benefit from the automatic recognition of descriptive referring expressions. Second, we demonstrated that descriptive referring expressions comprise a substantial fraction (18%) of the referring expressions in news and narrative. Along with museum descriptions, studied by Cheng, it seems that news and narrative are genres where authors naturally use a large number ofdescriptive referring expressions. Given that so little work has been done on descriptive referring expressions, this indicates that the field would be well served by focusing more attention on this phenomenon.

<p>Author: Veselin Stoyanov ; Claire Cardie ; Nathan Gilbert ; Ellen Riloff ; David Buttler ; David Hysom</p><p>Abstract: Despite the existence of several noun phrase coreference resolution data sets as well as several formal evaluations on the task, it remains frustratingly difficult to compare results across different coreference resolution systems. This is due to the high cost of implementing a complete end-to-end coreference resolution system, which often forces researchers to substitute available gold-standard information in lieu of implementing a module that would compute that information. Unfortunately, this leads to inconsistent and often unrealistic evaluation scenarios. With the aim to facilitate consistent and realistic experimental evaluations in coreference resolution, we present Reconcile, an infrastructure for the development of learning-based noun phrase (NP) coreference resolution systems. Reconcile is designed to facilitate the rapid creation of coreference resolution systems, easy implementation of new feature sets and approaches to coreference res- olution, and empirical evaluation of coreference resolvers across a variety of benchmark data sets and standard scoring metrics. We describe Reconcile and present experimental results showing that Reconcile can be used to create a coreference resolver that achieves performance comparable to state-ofthe-art systems on six benchmark data sets.</p><p>6 0.15672922 <a title="149-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Learning_to_Adapt_to_Unknown_Users%3A_Referring_Expression_Generation_in_Spoken_Dialogue_Systems.html">167 acl-2010-Learning to Adapt to Unknown Users: Referring Expression Generation in Spoken Dialogue Systems</a></p>

<p>Author: Ryu Iida ; Syumpei Kobayashi ; Takenobu Tokunaga</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an approach to reference resolution in situated dialogues by exploiting extra-linguistic information. Recently, investigations of referential behaviours involved in situations in the real world have received increasing attention by researchers (Di Eugenio et al., 2000; Byron, 2005; van Deemter, 2007; Spanger et al., 2009). In order to create an accurate reference resolution model, we need to handle extra-linguistic information as well as textual information examined by existing approaches (Soon et al., 2001 ; Ng and Cardie, 2002, etc.). In this paper, we incorporate extra-linguistic information into an existing corpus-based reference resolution model, and investigate its effects on refer- ence resolution problems within a corpus of Japanese dialogues. The results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves an accuracy of 79.0% for this task.</p><p>2 0.8444258 <a title="149-lsi-2" href="./acl-2010-The_Prevalence_of_Descriptive_Referring_Expressions_in_News_and_Narrative.html">231 acl-2010-The Prevalence of Descriptive Referring Expressions in News and Narrative</a></p>
<p>Author: Raquel Hervas ; Mark Finlayson</p><p>Abstract: Generating referring expressions is a key step in Natural Language Generation. Researchers have focused almost exclusively on generating distinctive referring expressions, that is, referring expressions that uniquely identify their intended referent. While undoubtedly one of their most important functions, referring expressions can be more than distinctive. In particular, descriptive referring expressions those that provide additional information not required for distinction are critical to flu– – ent, efficient, well-written text. We present a corpus analysis in which approximately one-fifth of 7,207 referring expressions in 24,422 words ofnews and narrative are descriptive. These data show that if we are ever to fully master natural language generation, especially for the genres of news and narrative, researchers will need to devote more attention to understanding how to generate descriptive, and not just distinctive, referring expressions. 1 A Distinctive Focus Generating referring expressions is a key step in Natural Language Generation (NLG). From early treatments in seminal papers by Appelt (1985) and Reiter and Dale (1992) to the recent set of Referring Expression Generation (REG) Challenges (Gatt et al., 2009) through different corpora available for the community (Eugenio et al., 1998; van Deemter et al., 2006; Viethen and Dale, 2008), generating referring expressions has become one of the most studied areas of NLG. Researchers studying this area have, almost without exception, focused exclusively on how to generate distinctive referring expressions, that is, referring expressions that unambiguously idenMark Alan Finlayson Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge, MA, 02139 USA markaf@mit .edu tify their intended referent. Referring expressions, however, may be more than distinctive. It is widely acknowledged that they can be used to achieve multiple goals, above and beyond distinction. Here we focus on descriptive referring expressions, that is, referring expressions that are not only distinctive, but provide additional information not required for identifying their intended referent. Consider the following text, in which some of the referring expressions have been underlined: Once upon a time there was a man, who had three daughters. They lived in a house and their dresses were made of fabric. While a bit strange, the text is perfectly wellformed. All the referring expressions are distinctive, in that we can properly identify the referents of each expression. But the real text, the opening lines to the folktale The Beauty and the Beast, is actually much more lyrical: Once upon a time there was a rich merchant, who had three daughters. They lived in a very fine house and their gowns were made of the richest fabric sewn with jewels. All the boldfaced portions namely, the choice of head nouns, the addition of adjectives, the use of appositive phrases serve to perform a descriptive function, and, importantly, are all unnecessary for distinction! In all of these cases, the author is using the referring expressions as a vehicle for communicating information about the referents. This descriptive information is sometimes – – new, sometimes necessary for understanding the text, and sometimes just for added flavor. But when the expression is descriptive, as opposed to distinctive, this additional information is not required for identifying the referent of the expression, and it is these sorts of referring expressions that we will be concerned with here. 49 Uppsala,P Srwoce de dni,n 1g1s- 1of6 t Jhuely AC 20L1 20 .1 ?0c 2 C0o1n0fe Aresnsoceci Sathio rnt f Poarp Ceorsm,p paugteastio 4n9a–l5 L4i,nguistics Although these sorts of referring expression have been mostly ignored by researchers in this area1 , we show in this corpus study that descriptive expressions are in fact quite prevalent: nearly one-fifth of referring expressions in news and narrative are descriptive. In particular, our data, the trained judgments of native English speakers, show that 18% of all distinctive referring expressions in news and 17% of those in narrative folktales are descriptive. With this as motivation, we argue that descriptive referring expressions must be studied more carefully, especially as the field progresses from referring in a physical, immediate context (like that in the REG Challenges) to generating more literary forms of text. 2 Corpus Annotation This is a corpus study; our procedure was therefore to define our annotation guidelines (Section 2.1), select texts to annotate (2.2), create an annotation tool for our annotators (2.3), and, finally, train annotators, have them annotate referring expressions’ constituents and function, and then adjudicate the double-annotated texts into a gold standard (2.4). 2.1 Definitions We wrote an annotation guide explaining the difference between distinctive and descriptive referring expressions. We used the guide when training annotators, and it was available to them while annotating. With limited space here we can only give an outline of what is contained in the guide; for full details see (Finlayson and Herv a´s, 2010a). Referring Expressions We defined referring expressions as referential noun phrases and their coreferential expressions, e.g., “John kissed Mary. She blushed.”. This included referring expressions to generics (e.g., “Lions are fierce”), dates, times, and numbers, as well as events if they were referred to using a noun phrase. We included in each referring expression all the determiners, quantifiers, adjectives, appositives, and prepositional phrases that syntactically attached to that expression. When referring expressions were nested, all the nested referring expressions were also marked separately. Nuclei vs. Modifiers In the only previous corpus study of descriptive referring expressions, on 1With the exception of a small amount of work, discussed in Section 4. museum labels, Cheng et al. (2001) noted that descriptive information is often integrated into referring expressions using modifiers to the head noun. To study this, and to allow our results to be more closely compared with Cheng’s, we had our annotators split referring expressions into their constituents, portions called either nuclei or modifiers. The nuclei were the portions of the referring expression that performed the ‘core’ referring function; the modifiers were those portions that could be varied, syntactically speaking, independently of the nuclei. Annotators then assigned a distinctive or descriptive function to each constituent, rather than the referring expression as a whole. Normally, the nuclei corresponded to the head of the noun phrase. In (1), the nucleus is the token king, which we have here surrounded with square brackets. The modifiers, surrounded by parentheses, are The and old. (1) (The) (old) [king] was wise. Phrasal modifiers were marked as single modifiers, for example, in (2). (2) (The) [roof] (of the house) collapsed. It is significant that we had our annotators mark and tag the nuclei of referring expressions. Cheng and colleagues only mentioned the possibility that additional information could be introduced in the modifiers. However, O’Donnell et al. (1998) observed that often the choice of head noun can also influence the function of a referring expression. Consider (3), in which the word villain is used to refer to the King. (3) The King assumed the throne today. I ’t trust (that) [villain] one bit. don The speaker could have merely used him to refer to the King–the choice of that particular head noun villain gives us additional information about the disposition of the speaker. Thus villain is descriptive. Function: Distinctive vs. Descriptive As already noted, instead of tagging the whole referring expression, annotators tagged each constituent (nuclei and modifiers) as distinctive or descriptive. The two main tests for determining descriptiveness were (a) if presence of the constituent was unnecessary for identifying the referent, or (b) if 50 the constituent was expressed using unusual or ostentatious word choice. If either was true, the constituent was considered descriptive; otherwise, it was tagged as distinctive. In cases where the constituent was completely irrelevant to identifying the referent, it was tagged as descriptive. For example, in the folktale The Princess and the Pea, from which (1) was extracted, there is only one king in the entire story. Thus, in that story, the king is sufficient for identification, and therefore the modifier old is descriptive. This points out the importance of context in determining distinctiveness or descriptiveness; if there had been a roomful of kings, the tags on those modifiers would have been reversed. There is some question as to whether copular predicates, such as the plumber in (4), are actually referring expressions. (4) John is the plumber Our annotators marked and tagged these constructions as normal referring expressions, but they added an additional flag to identify them as copular predicates. We then excluded these constructions from our final analysis. Note that copular predicates were treated differently from appositives: in appositives the predicate was included in the referring expression, and in most cases (again, depending on context) was marked descriptive (e.g., John, the plumber, slept.). 2.2 Text Selection Our corpus comprised 62 texts, all originally written in English, from two different genres, news and folktales. We began with 30 folktales of different sizes, totaling 12,050 words. These texts were used in a previous work on the influence of dialogues on anaphora resolution algorithms (Aggarwal et al., 2009); they were assembled with an eye toward including different styles, different authors, and different time periods. Following this, we matched, approximately, the number of words in the folktales by selecting 32 texts from Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993). These texts were selected at ran- dom from the first 200 texts in the corpus. 2.3 The Story Workbench We used the Story Workbench application (Finlayson, 2008) to actually perform the annotation. The Story Workbench is a semantic annotation program that, among other things, includes the ability to annotate referring expressions and coreferential relationships. We added the ability to annotate nuclei, modifiers, and their functions by writing a workbench “plugin” in Java that could be installed in the application. The Story Workbench is not yet available to the public at large, being in a limited distribution beta testing phase. The developers plan to release it as free software within the next year. At that time, we also plan to release our plugin as free, downloadable software. 2.4 Annotation & Adjudication The main task of the study was the annotation of the constituents of each referring expression, as well as the function (distinctive or descriptive) of each constituent. The system generated a first pass of constituent analysis, but did not mark functions. We hired two native English annotators, neither of whom had any linguistics background, who corrected these automatically-generated constituent analyses, and tagged each constituent as descriptive or distinctive. Every text was annotated by both annotators. Adjudication of the differences was conducted by discussion between the two annotators; the second author moderated these discussions and settled irreconcilable disagreements. We followed a “train-as-you-go” paradigm, where there was no distinct training period, but rather adjudication proceeded in step with annotation, and annotators received feedback during those sessions. We calculated two measures of inter-annotator agreement: a kappa statistic and an f-measure, shown in Table 1. All of our f-measures indicated that annotators agreed almost perfectly on the location of referring expressions and their breakdown into constituents. These agreement calculations were performed on the annotators’ original corrected texts. All the kappa statistics were calculated for two tags (nuclei vs. modifier for the constituents, and distinctive vs. descriptive for the functions) over both each token assigned to a nucleus or modifier and each referring expression pair. Our kappas indicate moderate to good agreement, especially for the folktales. These results are expected because of the inherent subjectivity of language. During the adjudication sessions it became clear that different people do not consider the same information 51 as obvious or descriptive for the same concepts, and even the contexts deduced by each annotators from the texts were sometimes substantially different. 3 Results Table 2 lists the primary results of the study. We considered a referring expression descriptive if any of its constituents were descriptive. Thus, 18% of the referring expressions in the corpus added additional information beyond what was required to unambiguously identify their referent. The results were similar in both genres.

Like Cheng’s results, our analysis shows that descriptive referring expressions make up a significant fraction of all referring expressions. Although Cheng did not examine nuclei, our results show that the use of descriptive nuclei is small but not negligible. 4 Relation to the Field Researchers working on generating referring expressions typically acknowledge that referring expressions can perform functions other than distinction. Despite this widespread acknowledgment, researchers have, for the most part, explicitly ignored these functions. Exceptions to this trend Tales Articles Total Nuclei3,6663,5027,168 Max. Nuc/Ref Dist.

Second and third are corpus studies by Cheng et al. (2001) and Jordan (2000a) that bear on the prevalence of descriptive referring expressions. The NLG subtask of aggregation can be used to imbue referring expressions with a descriptive function (Reiter and Dale, 2000, §5.3). There is a specific nk (iRned otefr aggregation 0c0al0le,d § embedding t ihsa at moves information from one clause to another inside the structure of a separate noun phrase. This type of aggregation can be used to transform two sentences such as “The princess lived in a castle. She was pretty ” into “The pretty princess lived in a castle ”. The adjective pretty, previously a cop- ular predicate, becomes a descriptive modifier of the reference to the princess, making the second text more natural and fluent. This kind of aggregation is widely used by humans for making the discourse more compact and efficient. In order to create NLG systems with this ability, we must take into account the caveat, noted by Cheng (1998), that any non-distinctive information in a referring expression must not lead to confusion about the distinctive function of the referring expression. This is by no means a trivial problem this sort of aggregation interferes with referring and coherence planning at both a local and global level (Cheng and Mellish, 2000; Cheng et al., 2001). It is clear, from the current state of the art of NLG, that we have not yet obtained a deep enough understanding of aggregation to enable us to handle these interactions. More research on the topic is needed. Two previous corpus studies have looked at the use of descriptive referring expressions. The first showed explicitly that people craft descriptive referring expressions to accomplish different – 52 goals. Jordan and colleagues (Jordan, 2000b; Jordan, 2000a) examined the use of referring expressions using the COCONUT corpus (Eugenio et al., 1998). They tested how domain and discourse goals can influence the content of non-pronominal referring expressions in a dialogue context, checking whether or not a subject’s goals led them to include non-referring information in a referring expression. Their results are intriguing because they point toward heretofore unexamined constraints, utilities and expectations (possibly genre- or styledependent) that may underlie the use ofdescriptive information to perform different functions, and are not yet captured by aggregation modules in particular or NLG systems in general. In the other corpus study, which partially inspired this work, Cheng and colleagues analyzed a set of museum descriptions, the GNOME corpus (Poesio, 2004), for the pragmatic functions of referring expressions. They had three functions in their study, in contrast to our two. Their first function (marked by their uniq tag) was equiv- alent to our distinctive function. The other two were specializations of our descriptive tag, where they differentiated between additional information that helped to understand the text (int), or additional information not necessary for understanding (att r). Despite their annotators seeming to have trouble distinguishing between the latter two tags, they did achieve good overall inter-annotator agreement. They identified 1,863 modifiers to referring expressions in their corpus, of which 47.3% fulfilled a descriptive (att r or int) function. This is supportive of our main assertion, namely, that descriptive referring expressions, not only crucial for efficient and fluent text, are actually a significant phenomenon. It is interesting, though, that Cheng’s fraction of descriptive referring expression was so much higher than ours (47.3% versus our 18%). We attribute this substantial difference to genre, in that Cheng studied museum labels, in which the writer is spaceconstrained, having to pack a lot of information into a small label. The issue bears further study, and perhaps will lead to insights into differences in writing style that may be attributed to author or genre. 5 Contributions We make two contributions in this paper. First, we assembled, double-annotated, and adjudicated into a gold-standard a corpus of 24,422 words. We marked all referring expressions, coreferential relations, and referring expression constituents, and tagged each constituent as having a descriptive or distinctive function. We wrote an annotation guide and created software that allows the annotation of this information in free text. The corpus and the guide are available on-line in a permanent digital archive (Finlayson and Herv a´s, 2010a; Finlayson and Herv a´s, 2010b). The software will also be released in the same archive when the Story Workbench annotation application is released to the public. This corpus will be useful for the automatic generation and analysis of both descriptive and distinctive referring expressions. Any kind of system intended to generate text as humans do must take into account that identifica- tion is not the only function of referring expressions. Many analysis applications would benefit from the automatic recognition of descriptive referring expressions. Second, we demonstrated that descriptive referring expressions comprise a substantial fraction (18%) of the referring expressions in news and narrative. Along with museum descriptions, studied by Cheng, it seems that news and narrative are genres where authors naturally use a large number ofdescriptive referring expressions. Given that so little work has been done on descriptive referring expressions, this indicates that the field would be well served by focusing more attention on this phenomenon.

<p>Author: Veselin Stoyanov ; Claire Cardie ; Nathan Gilbert ; Ellen Riloff ; David Buttler ; David Hysom</p><p>Abstract: Despite the existence of several noun phrase coreference resolution data sets as well as several formal evaluations on the task, it remains frustratingly difficult to compare results across different coreference resolution systems. This is due to the high cost of implementing a complete end-to-end coreference resolution system, which often forces researchers to substitute available gold-standard information in lieu of implementing a module that would compute that information. Unfortunately, this leads to inconsistent and often unrealistic evaluation scenarios. With the aim to facilitate consistent and realistic experimental evaluations in coreference resolution, we present Reconcile, an infrastructure for the development of learning-based noun phrase (NP) coreference resolution systems. Reconcile is designed to facilitate the rapid creation of coreference resolution systems, easy implementation of new feature sets and approaches to coreference res- olution, and empirical evaluation of coreference resolvers across a variety of benchmark data sets and standard scoring metrics. We describe Reconcile and present experimental results showing that Reconcile can be used to create a coreference resolver that achieves performance comparable to state-ofthe-art systems on six benchmark data sets.</p><p>6 0.4868333 <a title="149-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Learning_to_Adapt_to_Unknown_Users%3A_Referring_Expression_Generation_in_Spoken_Dialogue_Systems.html">167 acl-2010-Learning to Adapt to Unknown Users: Referring Expression Generation in Spoken Dialogue Systems</a></p>

<p>Author: Brian Pluss</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents ongoing research on computational models for non-cooperative dialogue. We start by analysing different levels of cooperation in conversation. Then, inspired by findings from an empirical study, we propose a technique for measuring non-cooperation in political interviews. Finally, we describe a research programme towards obtaining a suitable model and discuss previous accounts for conflictive dialogue, identifying the differences with our work.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.8978914 <a title="149-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Incorporating_Extra-Linguistic_Information_into_Reference_Resolution_in_Collaborative_Task_Dialogue.html">149 acl-2010-Incorporating Extra-Linguistic Information into Reference Resolution in Collaborative Task Dialogue</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryu Iida ; Syumpei Kobayashi ; Takenobu Tokunaga</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an approach to reference resolution in situated dialogues by exploiting extra-linguistic information. Recently, investigations of referential behaviours involved in situations in the real world have received increasing attention by researchers (Di Eugenio et al., 2000; Byron, 2005; van Deemter, 2007; Spanger et al., 2009). In order to create an accurate reference resolution model, we need to handle extra-linguistic information as well as textual information examined by existing approaches (Soon et al., 2001 ; Ng and Cardie, 2002, etc.). In this paper, we incorporate extra-linguistic information into an existing corpus-based reference resolution model, and investigate its effects on refer- ence resolution problems within a corpus of Japanese dialogues. The results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves an accuracy of 79.0% for this task.</p><p>3 0.79687971 <a title="149-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Generating_Focused_Topic-Specific_Sentiment_Lexicons.html">123 acl-2010-Generating Focused Topic-Specific Sentiment Lexicons</a></p>
<p>Author: Valentin Jijkoun ; Maarten de Rijke ; Wouter Weerkamp</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for automatically generating focused and accurate topicspecific subjectivity lexicons from a general purpose polarity lexicon that allow users to pin-point subjective on-topic information in a set of relevant documents. We motivate the need for such lexicons in the field of media analysis, describe a bootstrapping method for generating a topic-specific lexicon from a general purpose polarity lexicon, and evaluate the quality of the generated lexicons both manually and using a TREC Blog track test set for opinionated blog post retrieval. Although the generated lexicons can be an order of magnitude more selective than the general purpose lexicon, they maintain, or even improve, the performance of an opin- ion retrieval system.</p><p>4 0.71195644 <a title="149-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Inducing_Domain-Specific_Semantic_Class_Taggers_from_%28Almost%29_Nothing.html">150 acl-2010-Inducing Domain-Specific Semantic Class Taggers from (Almost) Nothing</a></p>
<p>Author: Ruihong Huang ; Ellen Riloff</p><p>Abstract: This research explores the idea of inducing domain-specific semantic class taggers using only a domain-specific text collection and seed words. The learning process begins by inducing a classifier that only has access to contextual features, forcing it to generalize beyond the seeds. The contextual classifier then labels new instances, to expand and diversify the training set. Next, a cross-category bootstrapping process simultaneously trains a suite of classifiers for multiple semantic classes. The positive instances for one class are used as negative instances for the others in an iterative bootstrapping cycle. We also explore a one-semantic-class-per-discourse heuristic, and use the classifiers to dynam- ically create semantic features. We evaluate our approach by inducing six semantic taggers from a collection of veterinary medicine message board posts.</p><p>5 0.6171301 <a title="149-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Sparsity_in_Dependency_Grammar_Induction.html">214 acl-2010-Sparsity in Dependency Grammar Induction</a></p>
<p>Author: Jennifer Gillenwater ; Kuzman Ganchev ; Joao Graca ; Fernando Pereira ; Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: A strong inductive bias is essential in unsupervised grammar induction. We explore a particular sparsity bias in dependency grammars that encourages a small number of unique dependency types. Specifically, we investigate sparsity-inducing penalties on the posterior distributions of parent-child POS tag pairs in the posterior regularization (PR) framework of Graça et al. (2007). In ex- periments with 12 languages, we achieve substantial gains over the standard expectation maximization (EM) baseline, with average improvement in attachment accuracy of 6.3%. Further, our method outperforms models based on a standard Bayesian sparsity-inducing prior by an average of 4.9%. On English in particular, we show that our approach improves on several other state-of-the-art techniques.</p><p>6 0.61556542 <a title="149-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-The_Prevalence_of_Descriptive_Referring_Expressions_in_News_and_Narrative.html">231 acl-2010-The Prevalence of Descriptive Referring Expressions in News and Narrative</a></p>

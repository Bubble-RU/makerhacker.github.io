<p>Author: Binyang Li ; Lanjun Zhou ; Shi Feng ; Kam-Fai Wong</p><p>Abstract: There is a growing research interest in opinion retrieval as on-line users’ opinions are becoming more and more popular in business, social networks, etc. Practically speaking, the goal of opinion retrieval is to retrieve documents, which entail opinions or comments, relevant to a target subject specified by the user’s query. A fundamental challenge in opinion retrieval is information representation. Existing research focuses on document-based approaches and documents are represented by bag-of-word. However, due to loss of contextual information, this representation fails to capture the associative information between an opinion and its corresponding target. It cannot distinguish different degrees of a sentiment word when associated with different targets. This in turn seriously affects opinion retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a sentence-based approach based on a new information representa- , tion, namely topic-sentiment word pair, to capture intra-sentence contextual information between an opinion and its target. Additionally, we consider inter-sentence information to capture the relationships among the opinions on the same topic. Finally, the two types of information are combined in a unified graph-based model, which can effectively rank the documents. Compared with existing approaches, experimental results on the COAE08 dataset showed that our graph-based model achieved significant improvement. 1</p><p>3 0.50028074 <a title="208-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Hierarchical_Sequential_Learning_for_Extracting_Opinions_and_Their_Attributes.html">134 acl-2010-Hierarchical Sequential Learning for Extracting Opinions and Their Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Yejin Choi ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: Automatic opinion recognition involves a number of related tasks, such as identifying the boundaries of opinion expression, determining their polarity, and determining their intensity. Although much progress has been made in this area, existing research typically treats each of the above tasks in isolation. In this paper, we apply a hierarchical parameter sharing technique using Conditional Random Fields for fine-grained opinion analysis, jointly detecting the boundaries of opinion expressions as well as determining two of their key attributes polarity and intensity. Our experimental results show that our proposed approach improves the performance over a baseline that does not — exploit hierarchical structure among the classes. In addition, we find that the joint approach outperforms a baseline that is based on cascading two separate components.</p><p>4 0.48435152 <a title="208-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Using_Anaphora_Resolution_to_Improve_Opinion_Target_Identification_in_Movie_Reviews.html">251 acl-2010-Using Anaphora Resolution to Improve Opinion Target Identification in Movie Reviews</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhi Zhong ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: Word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems based on supervised learning achieved the best performance in SensEval and SemEval workshops. However, there are few publicly available open source WSD systems. This limits the use of WSD in other applications, especially for researchers whose research interests are not in WSD. In this paper, we present IMS, a supervised English all-words WSD system. The flexible framework of IMS allows users to integrate different preprocessing tools, additional features, and different classifiers. By default, we use linear support vector machines as the classifier with multiple knowledge-based features. In our implementation, IMS achieves state-of-the-art results on several SensEval and SemEval tasks.</p><p>2 0.95992535 <a title="208-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-An_Active_Learning_Approach_to_Finding_Related_Terms.html">27 acl-2010-An Active Learning Approach to Finding Related Terms</a></p>
<p>Author: David Vickrey ; Oscar Kipersztok ; Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel system that helps nonexperts find sets of similar words. The user begins by specifying one or more seed words. The system then iteratively suggests a series of candidate words, which the user can either accept or reject. Current techniques for this task typically bootstrap a classifier based on a fixed seed set. In contrast, our system involves the user throughout the labeling process, using active learning to intelligently explore the space of similar words. In particular, our system can take advantage of negative examples provided by the user. Our system combines multiple preexisting sources of similarity data (a standard thesaurus, WordNet, contextual similarity), enabling it to capture many types of similarity groups (“synonyms of crash,” “types of car,” etc.). We evaluate on a hand-labeled evaluation set; our system improves over a strong baseline by 36%.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.9481495 <a title="208-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Sentence_and_Expression_Level_Annotation_of_Opinions_in_User-Generated_Discourse.html">208 acl-2010-Sentence and Expression Level Annotation of Opinions in User-Generated Discourse</a></p>

<p>Author: Nancy Ide ; Collin Baker ; Christiane Fellbaum ; Rebecca Passonneau</p><p>Abstract: The Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC) project provides data and annotations to serve as the base for a communitywide annotation effort of a subset of the American National Corpus. The MASC infrastructure enables the incorporation of contributed annotations into a single, usable format that can then be analyzed as it is or ported to any of a variety of other formats. MASC includes data from a much wider variety of genres than existing multiply-annotated corpora of English, and the project is committed to a fully open model of distribution, without restriction, for all data and annotations produced or contributed. As such, MASC is the first large-scale, open, communitybased effort to create much needed language resources for NLP. This paper describes the MASC project, its corpus and annotations, and serves as a call for contributions of data and annotations from the language processing community.</p><p>6 0.82992834 <a title="208-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Combining_Orthogonal_Monolingual_and_Multilingual_Sources_of_Evidence_for_All_Words_WSD.html">62 acl-2010-Combining Orthogonal Monolingual and Multilingual Sources of Evidence for All Words WSD</a></p>

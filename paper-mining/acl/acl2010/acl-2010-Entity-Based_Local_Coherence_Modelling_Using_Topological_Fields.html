<p>Author: Emily Pitler ; Annie Louis ; Ani Nenkova</p><p>Abstract: To date, few attempts have been made to develop and validate methods for automatic evaluation of linguistic quality in text summarization. We present the first systematic assessment of several diverse classes of metrics designed to capture various aspects of well-written text. We train and test linguistic quality models on consecutive years of NIST evaluation data in order to show the generality of results. For grammaticality, the best results come from a set of syntactic features. Focus, coherence and referential clarity are best evaluated by a class of features measuring local coherence on the basis of cosine similarity between sentences, coreference informa- tion, and summarization specific features. Our best results are 90% accuracy for pairwise comparisons of competing systems over a test set of several inputs and 70% for ranking summaries of a specific input.</p><p>3 0.16739111 <a title="101-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Supervised_Noun_Phrase_Coreference_Research%3A_The_First_Fifteen_Years.html">219 acl-2010-Supervised Noun Phrase Coreference Research: The First Fifteen Years</a></p>

<p>Author: Haitao Mi ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: Tree-to-string systems (and their forestbased extensions) have gained steady popularity thanks to their simplicity and efficiency, but there is a major limitation: they are unable to guarantee the grammaticality of the output, which is explicitly modeled in string-to-tree systems via targetside syntax. We thus propose to combine the advantages of both, and present a novel constituency-to-dependency translation model, which uses constituency forests on the source side to direct the translation, and dependency trees on the target side (as a language model) to ensure grammaticality. Medium-scale experiments show an absolute and statistically significant improvement of +0.7 BLEU points over a state-of-the-art forest-based tree-to-string system even with fewer rules. This is also the first time that a treeto-tree model can surpass tree-to-string counterparts.</p><p>5 0.13934691 <a title="101-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-The_Influence_of_Discourse_on_Syntax%3A_A_Psycholinguistic_Model_of_Sentence_Processing.html">229 acl-2010-The Influence of Discourse on Syntax: A Psycholinguistic Model of Sentence Processing</a></p>
<p>Author: Amit Dubey</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic models of sentence comprehension are increasingly relevant to questions concerning human language processing. However, such models are often limited to syntactic factors. This paper introduces a novel sentence processing model that consists of a parser augmented with a probabilistic logic-based model of coreference resolution, which allows us to simulate how context interacts with syntax in a reading task. Our simulations show that a Weakly Interactive cognitive architecture can explain data which had been provided as evidence for the Strongly Interactive hypothesis.</p><p>6 0.13129872 <a title="101-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-An_Entity-Level_Approach_to_Information_Extraction.html">28 acl-2010-An Entity-Level Approach to Information Extraction</a></p>

<p>Author: Neil McIntyre ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we develop a story generator that leverages knowledge inherent in corpora without requiring extensive manual involvement. A key feature in our approach is the reliance on a story planner which we acquire automatically by recording events, their participants, and their precedence relationships in a training corpus. Contrary to previous work our system does not follow a generate-and-rank architecture. Instead, we employ evolutionary search techniques to explore the space of possible stories which we argue are well suited to the story generation task. Experiments on generating simple children’s stories show that our system outperforms pre- vious data-driven approaches.</p><p>3 0.60759759 <a title="101-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-Automatic_Evaluation_of_Linguistic_Quality_in_Multi-Document_Summarization.html">38 acl-2010-Automatic Evaluation of Linguistic Quality in Multi-Document Summarization</a></p>

<p>Author: Ryu Iida ; Syumpei Kobayashi ; Takenobu Tokunaga</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an approach to reference resolution in situated dialogues by exploiting extra-linguistic information. Recently, investigations of referential behaviours involved in situations in the real world have received increasing attention by researchers (Di Eugenio et al., 2000; Byron, 2005; van Deemter, 2007; Spanger et al., 2009). In order to create an accurate reference resolution model, we need to handle extra-linguistic information as well as textual information examined by existing approaches (Soon et al., 2001 ; Ng and Cardie, 2002, etc.). In this paper, we incorporate extra-linguistic information into an existing corpus-based reference resolution model, and investigate its effects on refer- ence resolution problems within a corpus of Japanese dialogues. The results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves an accuracy of 79.0% for this task.</p><p>6 0.54385698 <a title="101-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Coreference_Resolution_across_Corpora%3A_Languages%2C_Coding_Schemes%2C_and_Preprocessing_Information.html">72 acl-2010-Coreference Resolution across Corpora: Languages, Coding Schemes, and Preprocessing Information</a></p>

Several types of dialogue act (DA) are distinguished on the basis of their roles in formulating decisions. HGMs enable us to model dependencies between observed features of discussions, decision DAs, and subdialogues that result in a decision. For the task of detecting decision regions, an HGM classifier was found to outperform non-hierarchical graphical models and support vector machines, raising the F1-score to 0.80 from 0.55.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.80777824 <a title="101-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Entity-Based_Local_Coherence_Modelling_Using_Topological_Fields.html">101 acl-2010-Entity-Based Local Coherence Modelling Using Topological Fields</a></p>

<p>Author: Decong Li ; Sujian Li ; Wenjie Li ; Wei Wang ; Weiguang Qu</p><p>Abstract: It is a fundamental and important task to extract key phrases from documents. Generally, phrases in a document are not independent in delivering the content of the document. In order to capture and make better use of their relationships in key phrase extraction, we suggest exploring the Wikipedia knowledge to model a document as a semantic network, where both n-ary and binary relationships among phrases are formulated. Based on a commonly accepted assumption that the title of a document is always elaborated to reflect the content of a document and consequently key phrases tend to have close semantics to the title, we propose a novel semi-supervised key phrase extraction approach in this paper by computing the phrase importance in the semantic network, through which the influence of title phrases is propagated to the other phrases iteratively. Experimental results demonstrate the remarkable performance of this approach. 1</p><p>4 0.73207635 <a title="101-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Contextualizing_Semantic_Representations_Using_Syntactically_Enriched_Vector_Models.html">70 acl-2010-Contextualizing Semantic Representations Using Syntactically Enriched Vector Models</a></p>

<p>Author: WenTing Wang ; Jian Su ; Chew Lim Tan</p><p>Abstract: Syntactic knowledge is important for discourse relation recognition. Yet only heuristically selected flat paths and 2-level production rules have been used to incorporate such information so far. In this paper we propose using tree kernel based approach to automatically mine the syntactic information from the parse trees for discourse analysis, applying kernel function to the tree structures directly. These structural syntactic features, together with other normal flat features are incorporated into our composite kernel to capture diverse knowledge for simultaneous discourse identification and classification for both explicit and implicit relations. The experiment shows tree kernel approach is able to give statistical significant improvements over flat syntactic path feature. We also illustrate that tree kernel approach covers more structure information than the production rules, which allows tree kernel to further incorporate information from a higher dimension space for possible better discrimination. Besides, we further propose to leverage on temporal ordering information to constrain the interpretation of discourse relation, which also demonstrate statistical significant improvements for discourse relation recognition on PDTB 2.0 for both explicit and implicit as well.

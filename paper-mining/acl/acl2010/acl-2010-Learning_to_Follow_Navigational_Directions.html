<p>Author: S.R.K. Branavan ; Luke Zettlemoyer ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the task of mapping high-level instructions to sequences of commands in an external environment. Processing these instructions is challenging—they posit goals to be achieved without specifying the steps required to complete them. We describe a method that fills in missing information using an automatically derived environment model that encodes states, transitions, and commands that cause these transitions to happen. We present an efficient approximate approach for learning this environment model as part of a policygradient reinforcement learning algorithm for text interpretation. This design enables learning for mapping high-level instructions, which previous statistical methods cannot handle.1</p><p>3 0.26357144 <a title="168-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Learning_to_Adapt_to_Unknown_Users%3A_Referring_Expression_Generation_in_Spoken_Dialogue_Systems.html">167 acl-2010-Learning to Adapt to Unknown Users: Referring Expression Generation in Spoken Dialogue Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Srinivasan Janarthanam ; Oliver Lemon</p><p>Abstract: We present a data-driven approach to learn user-adaptive referring expression generation (REG) policies for spoken dialogue systems. Referring expressions can be difficult to understand in technical domains where users may not know the technical ‘jargon’ names of the domain entities. In such cases, dialogue systems must be able to model the user’s (lexical) domain knowledge and use appropriate referring expressions. We present a reinforcement learning (RL) framework in which the sys- tem learns REG policies which can adapt to unknown users online. Furthermore, unlike supervised learning methods which require a large corpus of expert adaptive behaviour to train on, we show that effective adaptive policies can be learned from a small dialogue corpus of non-adaptive human-machine interaction, by using a RL framework and a statistical user simulation. We show that in comparison to adaptive hand-coded baseline policies, the learned policy performs significantly better, with an 18.6% average increase in adaptation accuracy. The best learned policy also takes less dialogue time (average 1.07 min less) than the best hand-coded policy. This is because the learned policies can adapt online to changing evidence about the user’s domain expertise.</p><p>4 0.20527758 <a title="168-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Automated_Planning_for_Situated_Natural_Language_Generation.html">35 acl-2010-Automated Planning for Situated Natural Language Generation</a></p>

<p>Author: Verena Rieser ; Oliver Lemon ; Xingkun Liu</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to Information Presentation (IP) in Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) using a data-driven statistical optimisation framework for content planning and attribute selection. First we collect data in a Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) experiment and use it to build a supervised model of human behaviour. This forms a baseline for measuring the performance of optimised policies, developed from this data using Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. We show that the optimised policies significantly outperform the baselines in a variety of generation scenarios: while the supervised model is able to attain up to 87.6% of the possible reward on this task, the RL policies are significantly better in 5 out of 6 scenarios, gaining up to 91.5% of the total possible reward. The RL policies perform especially well in more complex scenarios. We are also the first to show that adding predictive “lower level” features (e.g. from the NLG realiser) is important for optimising IP strategies according to user preferences. This provides new insights into the nature of the IP problem for SDS.</p><p>6 0.10848147 <a title="168-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Importance-Driven_Turn-Bidding_for_Spoken_Dialogue_Systems.html">142 acl-2010-Importance-Driven Turn-Bidding for Spoken Dialogue Systems</a></p>

<p>Author: Myroslava O. Dzikovska ; Johanna D. Moore ; Natalie Steinhauser ; Gwendolyn Campbell</p><p>Abstract: Supporting natural language input may improve learning in intelligent tutoring systems. However, interpretation errors are unavoidable and require an effective recovery policy. We describe an evaluation of an error recovery policy in the BEETLE II tutorial dialogue system and discuss how different types of interpretation problems affect learning gain and user satisfaction. In particular, the problems arising from student use of non-standard terminology appear to have negative consequences. We argue that existing strategies for dealing with terminology problems are insufficient and that improving such strategies is important in future ITS research.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.81976295 <a title="168-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Learning_to_Follow_Navigational_Directions.html">168 acl-2010-Learning to Follow Navigational Directions</a></p>

<p>Author: Hiroshi Echizen-ya ; Kenji Araki</p><p>Abstract: As described in this paper, we propose a new automatic evaluation method for machine translation using noun-phrase chunking. Our method correctly determines the matching words between two sentences using corresponding noun phrases. Moreover, our method determines the similarity between two sentences in terms of the noun-phrase order of appearance. Evaluation experiments were conducted to calculate the correlation among human judgments, along with the scores produced us- ing automatic evaluation methods for MT outputs obtained from the 12 machine translation systems in NTCIR7. Experimental results show that our method obtained the highest correlations among the methods in both sentence-level adequacy and fluency.</p><p>4 0.67519885 <a title="168-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Beetle_II%3A_A_System_for_Tutoring_and_Computational_Linguistics_Experimentation.html">47 acl-2010-Beetle II: A System for Tutoring and Computational Linguistics Experimentation</a></p>

<p>Author: Weiwei Sun</p><p>Abstract: Developing features has been shown crucial to advancing the state-of-the-art in Semantic Role Labeling (SRL). To improve Chinese SRL, we propose a set of additional features, some of which are designed to better capture structural information. Our system achieves 93.49 Fmeasure, a significant improvement over the best reported performance 92.0. We are further concerned with the effect of parsing in Chinese SRL. We empirically analyze the two-fold effect, grouping words into constituents and providing syntactic information. We also give some preliminary linguistic explanations.</p><p>6 0.53085434 <a title="168-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Reading_between_the_Lines%3A_Learning_to_Map_High-Level_Instructions_to_Commands.html">202 acl-2010-Reading between the Lines: Learning to Map High-Level Instructions to Commands</a></p>

<p>Author: Ashwin Ittoo ; Gosse Bouma</p><p>Abstract: An important relation in information extraction is the part-whole relation. Ontological studies mention several types of this relation. In this paper, we show that the traditional practice of initializing minimally-supervised algorithms with a single set that mixes seeds of different types fails to capture the wide variety of part-whole patterns and tuples. The results obtained with mixed seeds ultimately converge to one of the part-whole relation types. We also demonstrate that all the different types of part-whole relations can still be discovered, regardless of the type characterized by the initializing seeds. We performed our experiments with a state-ofthe-art information extraction algorithm. 1</p><p>3 0.13377473 <a title="160-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-A_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation_Method_for_Selectional_Preferences.html">10 acl-2010-A Latent Dirichlet Allocation Method for Selectional Preferences</a></p>
<p>Author: Alan Ritter ; Mausam Mausam ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: The computation of selectional preferences, the admissible argument values for a relation, is a well-known NLP task with broad applicability. We present LDA-SP, which utilizes LinkLDA (Erosheva et al., 2004) to model selectional preferences. By simultaneously inferring latent topics and topic distributions over relations, LDA-SP combines the benefits of previous approaches: like traditional classbased approaches, it produces humaninterpretable classes describing each relation’s preferences, but it is competitive with non-class-based methods in predictive power. We compare LDA-SP to several state-ofthe-art methods achieving an 85% increase in recall at 0.9 precision over mutual information (Erk, 2007). We also evaluate LDA-SP’s effectiveness at filtering improper applications of inference rules, where we show substantial improvement over Pantel et al. ’s system (Pantel et al., 2007).</p><p>4 0.12205926 <a title="160-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Experiments_in_Graph-Based_Semi-Supervised_Learning_Methods_for_Class-Instance_Acquisition.html">109 acl-2010-Experiments in Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning Methods for Class-Instance Acquisition</a></p>
<p>Author: Partha Pratim Talukdar ; Fernando Pereira</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms have been successfully used to extract class-instance pairs from large unstructured and structured text collections. However, a careful comparison of different graph-based SSL algorithms on that task has been lacking. We compare three graph-based SSL algorithms for class-instance acquisition on a variety of graphs constructed from different domains. We find that the recently proposed MAD algorithm is the most effective. We also show that class-instance extraction can be significantly improved by adding semantic information in the form of instance-attribute edges derived from an independently developed knowledge base. All of our code and data will be made publicly available to encourage reproducible research in this area.</p><p>5 0.1217825 <a title="160-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Inducing_Domain-Specific_Semantic_Class_Taggers_from_%28Almost%29_Nothing.html">150 acl-2010-Inducing Domain-Specific Semantic Class Taggers from (Almost) Nothing</a></p>
<p>Author: Ruihong Huang ; Ellen Riloff</p><p>Abstract: This research explores the idea of inducing domain-specific semantic class taggers using only a domain-specific text collection and seed words. The learning process begins by inducing a classifier that only has access to contextual features, forcing it to generalize beyond the seeds. The contextual classifier then labels new instances, to expand and diversify the training set. Next, a cross-category bootstrapping process simultaneously trains a suite of classifiers for multiple semantic classes. The positive instances for one class are used as negative instances for the others in an iterative bootstrapping cycle. We also explore a one-semantic-class-per-discourse heuristic, and use the classifiers to dynam- ically create semantic features. We evaluate our approach by inducing six semantic taggers from a collection of veterinary medicine message board posts.</p><p>6 0.11605146 <a title="160-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Fully_Unsupervised_Core-Adjunct_Argument_Classification.html">120 acl-2010-Fully Unsupervised Core-Adjunct Argument Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Richard Power</p><p>Abstract: We describe the strategy currently pursued for verbalising OWL ontologies by sentences in Controlled Natural Language (i.e., combining generic rules for realising logical patterns with ontology-specific lexicons for realising atomic terms for individuals, classes, and properties) and argue that its success depends on assumptions about the complexity of terms and axioms in the ontology. We then show, through analysis of a corpus of ontologies, that although these assumptions could in principle be violated, they are overwhelmingly respected in practice by ontology developers.</p><p>5 0.65694362 <a title="160-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Hunting_for_the_Black_Swan%3A_Risk_Mining_from_Text.html">138 acl-2010-Hunting for the Black Swan: Risk Mining from Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Jochen Leidner ; Frank Schilder</p><p>Abstract: In the business world, analyzing and dealing with risk permeates all decisions and actions. However, to date, risk identification, the first step in the risk management cycle, has always been a manual activity with little to no intelligent software tool support. In addition, although companies are required to list risks to their business in their annual SEC filings in the USA, these descriptions are often very highlevel and vague. In this paper, we introduce Risk Mining, which is the task of identifying a set of risks pertaining to a business area or entity. We argue that by combining Web mining and Information Extraction (IE) techniques, risks can be detected automatically before they materialize, thus providing valuable business intelligence. We describe a system that induces a risk taxonomy with concrete risks (e.g., interest rate changes) at its leaves and more abstract risks (e.g., financial risks) closer to its root node. The taxonomy is induced via a bootstrapping algorithms starting with a few seeds. The risk taxonomy is used by the system as input to a risk monitor that matches risk mentions in financial documents to the abstract risk types, thus bridging a lexical gap. Our system is able to automatically generate company specific “risk maps”, which we demonstrate for a corpus of earnings report conference calls.</p><p>6 0.63452488 <a title="160-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Learning_Word-Class_Lattices_for_Definition_and_Hypernym_Extraction.html">166 acl-2010-Learning Word-Class Lattices for Definition and Hypernym Extraction</a></p>

In this paper, we present a novel approach for constructing speech motor exercises, based on linguistic knowledge extracted from spoken language corpora. In our study with the Dutch Spoken Corpus, syllabic inventories were obtained by means of automatic syllabification of the spoken language data. Our experimental syllabification method exhibited a reliable performance, and allowed for the acquisition of syllabic tokens from the corpus. Consequently, the syl- labic tokens were integrated in a tool for clinicians, a result which holds the potential of contributing to the current state of speech motor training methodologies.</p><p>2 0.78629011 <a title="160-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Cognitively_Plausible_Models_of_Human_Language_Processing.html">59 acl-2010-Cognitively Plausible Models of Human Language Processing</a></p>
<p>Author: Frank Keller</p><p>Abstract: We pose the development of cognitively plausible models of human language processing as a challenge for computational linguistics. Existing models can only deal with isolated phenomena (e.g., garden paths) on small, specifically selected data sets. The challenge is to build models that integrate multiple aspects of human language processing at the syntactic, semantic, and discourse level. Like human language processing, these models should be incremental, predictive, broad coverage, and robust to noise. This challenge can only be met if standardized data sets and evaluation measures are developed.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.76852721 <a title="160-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Learning_Arguments_and_Supertypes_of_Semantic_Relations_Using_Recursive_Patterns.html">160 acl-2010-Learning Arguments and Supertypes of Semantic Relations Using Recursive Patterns</a></p>

<p>Author: Stephen Wu ; Asaf Bachrach ; Carlos Cardenas ; William Schuler</p><p>Abstract: Hierarchical HMM (HHMM) parsers make promising cognitive models: while they use a bounded model of working memory and pursue incremental hypotheses in parallel, they still achieve parsing accuracies competitive with chart-based techniques. This paper aims to validate that a right-corner HHMM parser is also able to produce complexity metrics, which quantify a reader’s incremental difficulty in understanding a sentence. Besides defining standard metrics in the HHMM framework, a new metric, embedding difference, is also proposed, which tests the hypothesis that HHMM store elements represents syntactic working memory. Results show that HHMM surprisal outperforms all other evaluated metrics in predicting reading times, and that embedding difference makes a significant, independent contribution.</p><p>6 0.66289288 <a title="160-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Syntactic_and_Semantic_Factors_in_Processing_Difficulty%3A_An_Integrated_Measure.html">220 acl-2010-Syntactic and Semantic Factors in Processing Difficulty: An Integrated Measure</a></p>

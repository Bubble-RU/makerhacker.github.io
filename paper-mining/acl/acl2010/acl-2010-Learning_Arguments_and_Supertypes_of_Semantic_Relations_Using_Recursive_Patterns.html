</p><p>4 We also compare our results with existing knowledge base to outline the similarities  and differences of the granularity and diversity of the harvested knowledge. [sent-6, score-0.339]
</p><p>5 Researchers have also successfully harvested relations between entities, such as is-a (Hearst, 1992; Pasca, 2004) and part-of (Girju et al. [sent-12, score-0.365]
</p><p>6 This knowledge is usually used to support inference and is expressed as selectional restrictions (Wilks, 1975) (namely, the types of arguments that may fill a given relation, such as person live-in city and airline fly-to location). [sent-18, score-0.626]
</p><p>7 Selectional restrictions constrain the possible fillers of a relation, and hence the possible contexts in which the patterns expressing that relation can participate in, thereby enabling sense disambiguation of both the fillers and the expression itself. [sent-19, score-0.339]
</p><p>8 In contrast pattern-based approaches are more precise, but they typically require a handful to dozens of seeds and lexico-syntactic patterns to initiate the learning process. [sent-22, score-0.294]

</p><p>14 Given these considerations, we address in this  paper the following question: How can the selectional restrictions of semantic relations be learned automaticallyfrom the Web with minimal effort using lexico-syntactic recursive patterns? [sent-32, score-0.77]

</p><p>18 •  2  Related Work  A substantial body of work has been done in attempts to harvest bits of semantic information, including: semantic lexicons (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997), concept lists (Lin and Pantel, 2002), isa relations (Hearst, 1992; Etzioni et al. [sent-44, score-0.421]
</p><p>19 Knowledge has been harvested with varying success both from structured text such as Wikipedia’s infoboxes (Suchanek et al. [sent-48, score-0.286]
</p><p>20 TextRunner scans sentences to obtain relation-independent lexico-syntactic patterns to extract triples of the form (John, fly to, Prague). [sent-56, score-0.344]
</p><p>21 The middle string denotes some (unspecified) semantic relation while the first and third denote the learned arguments of this relation. [sent-57, score-0.456]
</p><p>22 But TextRunner does not seek specific semantic relations, and does not re-use the patterns it harvests with different arguments in order to extend their yields. [sent-58, score-0.49]
</p><p>23 The objective of our research is to combine the strengths of the two approaches, and, in addition, to provide even richer information by automati-  cally mapping each harvested argument to its supertype(s) (i. [sent-60, score-0.402]
</p><p>24 This information provides the selectional restrictions of the given semantic relation, indicating that living things like people can fly to cities and events, while non-living things like airlines fly mainly to cities. [sent-64, score-0.931]
</p><p>25 Knowing the sectional restrictions of a semantic relation supports inference in many applications, for example enabling more accurate information extraction. [sent-68, score-0.304]

</p><p>27 In order to obtain selectional restriction classes, (Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2006) made an attempt to ontologize the harvested arguments of is-a, part-of, and cause relations. [sent-73, score-0.628]
</p><p>28 They mapped each argument of the relation into WordNet and identified the senses for which the relation holds. [sent-74, score-0.301]
</p><p>29 Unfortunately, despite its very high precision entries, WordNet is known to have limited coverage, which makes it impossible for algorithms to map the content of a relation whose arguments are not present in WordNet. [sent-75, score-0.299]
</p><p>30 , 2009), which, given two arguments, harvests its supertypes from the source corpus. [sent-77, score-0.436]
</p><p>31 3  Recursive Patterns  A singly-anchored pattern contains one example of the seed term (the anchor) and one open position for the term to be learned. [sent-80, score-0.26]
</p><p>32 Most researchers use singly-anchored patterns to harvest semantic relations. [sent-81, score-0.31]
</p><p>33 To surmount this obstacle, a handful of seeds is generally used, and helps to guarantee diversity in the extraction of new lexicosyntactic patterns (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Snow et al. [sent-83, score-0.448]
</p><p>34 Interestingly, recent work reports a class of patterns that use only one seed to learn as much information with only one seed. [sent-95, score-0.267]
</p><p>35 , 2009) introduce the so-called doublyanchored pattern (DAP) that has two anchor seed positions “htypei such as hseedi and *”, plus one open position pfeori tshuec hter amss h steoe d bei l aenadrn *ed”,. [sent-98, score-0.42]
</p><p>36 pLleuasron ende terms can then be replaced into the seed position automatically, creating a recursive procedure that is reportedly much more accurate and has much higher final yield. [sent-99, score-0.383]
</p><p>37 No other study has described the use or effect of recursive patterns for different semantic relations. [sent-105, score-0.468]
</p><p>38 , 2009), we here introduce recursive patterns other than DAP that use only one seed to harvest the arguments and supertypes of a wide variety of relations. [sent-108, score-1.166]
</p><p>39 (Banko and Etzioni, 2008) show that semantic relations can be expressed using a handful of relation-independent lexico-syntactic patterns. [sent-109, score-0.251]
</p><p>40 Practically, we can turn any of these patterns into recursive form by giving as input only one of the arguments and leaving the other one as an open slot, allowing the learned arguments to replace the initial seed argument directly. [sent-110, score-1.11]
</p><p>41 Potentially, one can explore all recursive pattern variations when learning a relation and compare their yield, however this study is beyond the scope of this paper. [sent-113, score-0.422]
</p><p>42 , 2008), (2) use only one seed instance for the discovery of new previously unknown terms, and (3) harvest knowledge with minimal supervision. [sent-115, score-0.247]
</p><p>43 Given a seed John and a semantic relation fly to  expressed using the recursive pattern “* and John fly to *”, our algorithm learns the left side arguments {Brian, Kate, bees, Delta, Alaska} and the right ss {idBer arguments {flowers, trees, party, d N tehwe York, Italy, France}.

</p><p>46 For instance, people fly to events and countries, but never to trees or flowers. [sent-124, score-0.238]
</p><p>47 The algorithm has two phases: argument harvesting and supertype harvesting. [sent-129, score-0.553]
</p><p>48 The final output is a ranked list of interlinked concepts which captures the selectional restrictions of the relation. [sent-130, score-0.388]
</p><p>49 1 Argument Harvesting In the argument extraction phase, the first boot-  strapping iteration is initiated with a seed Y and a recursive pattern “X∗ and Y verb+prep|verb|noun Z∗ ”, where X∗ and Z∗ are the placeholders for the arguments to be learned. [sent-133, score-0.838]
</p><p>50 The newly learned and previously unexplored arguments on the X∗ position are used as seeds in the subsequent iteration. [sent-136, score-0.439]
</p><p>51 The arguments on the Z∗ position are stored at each iteration, but never used as seeds since the recursivity is created using the terms on X and Y . [sent-137, score-0.382]
</p><p>52 The bootstrapping process is implemented as an exhaustive breadth-first algorithm which terminates when all arguments are explored. [sent-138, score-0.344]
</p><p>53 We incorporate the harvested arguments on X and Y positions in a directed graph G = (V, E), where each vertex  v ∈ V is a candidate argument and each edge (u, v) ∈ iEs aind ciacnadteids athteat a trgheu argument v aisc genera(tue,dv by ∈th Ee argument u. [sent-141, score-0.971]
</p><p>54 Intuitively, our confidence in a correct argument u increases when the argument (1) discovers and (2) is discovered by many different arguments. [sent-144, score-0.286]
</p><p>55 Similarly, to rank the arguments standing on the Z position, we build a bipartite graph G0 = (V0, E0) that has two types of vertices. [sent-145, score-0.259]
</p><p>56 One set of vertices represents the arguments found on the Y position in the recursive pattern. [sent-146, score-0.555]
</p><p>57 The second set of vertices represents the arguments learned on the Z position. [sent-148, score-0.331]
</p><p>58 We create an edge e0(u0, v0) ∈ E0 between u0 ∈ Vy and v0 ∈ Vz when the argument on the Z position represented by v0 was harvested by  the argument on the Y position represented by u0. [sent-150, score-0.671]
</p><p>59 Vertex v0is ranked as v0= In a very large corpus, like theP Web,| Vw|e− a1ssume that a correct argument Z is the one that is frequently discovered by various arguments Y . [sent-153, score-0.445]
</p><p>60 2  Supertype Harvesting  In the supertype extraction phase, we take all   argument pairs collected during the argument harvesting stage and instantiate them in the inverse DAP−1 pattern “* such as X and Y”. [sent-156, score-0.836]

</p><p>63 e For example, imagine that the argument X∗= Ryanair was harvested in the previous phase by the recursive pattern “X∗ and EasyJet fly to Z∗ ”. [sent-164, score-0.983]
</p><p>64 Then the pair hRyanair,EasyJeti forms a new Web query “e* p sauirch hR as Ryanair Jaentid f EasyJet” ww Whicehb learns the supertypes “airlines ” and “carriers”. [sent-165, score-0.478]
</p><p>65 The bipartite graph has two vertices v010 and v020 for the supertypes “airlines ” and “carriers ”, one vertex u030 for the argument pair hRyanair, EasyJeti, and twof edges e010(u030, v010) apnaidPr e020(u030, v010). [sent-166, score-0.67]
</p><p>66 Intuitively, a supertype whiPch is di|sVco|v−e1red multiple times by various argument pairs is ranked highly. [sent-168, score-0.471]
</p><p>67 However, it might happen that a highly ranked supertype actually does not satisfy the selectional restrictions of the semantic relation. [sent-169, score-0.702]
</p><p>68 To avoid such situations, we further instantiate each supertype concept in the original pattern1 . [sent-170, score-0.286]
</p><p>69 For example,  “aircompanies fly to *” and “carriers fly to *”. [sent-171, score-0.418]
</p><p>70 If the candidate supertype produces many web hits for the query, then this suggests that the term is a relevant supertype. [sent-172, score-0.307]
</p><p>71 Unfortunately, to learn the supertypes of the Z arguments, currently we have to form all possible combinations among the top 150 highly ranked concepts, because these arguments have not been learned through pairing. [sent-173, score-0.79]
</p><p>72 1Except for the “dress” and “person ” relations, where the targeted arguments are adjectives, and the supertypes are nouns. [sent-175, score-0.621]
</p><p>73 5  Semantic Relations  So far, we have described the mechanism that learns from one seed and a recursive pattern the selectional restrictions of any semantic relation. [sent-176, score-0.849]
</p><p>74 Space prevents us from describing all of them, therefore we focus on the three most frequent patterns which capture a large diversity of semantic relations. [sent-181, score-0.274]
</p><p>75 1 Data Collection Table 1 shows the lexico-syntactic pattern and the initial seed we used to express each semantic relation. [sent-187, score-0.312]
</p><p>76 In total, we collected 30GB raw data which was part-of-speech tagged and used for the argument and supertype extraction. [sent-191, score-0.389]
</p><p>77 An interesting characteristic of the recursive patterns is the speed of leaning which can be measured in terms of the number of unique arguments acquired during each bootstrapping iteration. [sent-194, score-0.719]
</p><p>78 Although both relations differ in terms of the total number of iterations and harvested items, the overall behavior of the learning curves is similar. [sent-196, score-0.365]
</p><p>79 The speed of leaning is related to the connectivity behavior of the arguments of the relation. [sent-199, score-0.26]
</p><p>80 , 2007) actually allowed us to collect the arguments for all our semantic relations. [sent-209, score-0.32]
</p><p>81 , 2007), which was harvested from the Infoboxes tables in Wikipedia. [sent-213, score-0.259]
</p><p>82 1 Human-Based Argument Evaluation In this section, we discuss the results of the harvested arguments. [sent-220, score-0.259]
</p><p>83 The overall accuracy of the argument harvesting phase is 91%. [sent-235, score-0.336]
</p><p>84 The recursive patterns learn information about non-famous entities like Peter and famous entities like Michael Jordan. [sent-248, score-0.398]
</p><p>85 However, the recursive pattern learned arguments like pain, effort which express a manner of living, and locations like slums, box. [sent-251, score-0.62]
</p><p>86 In addition, the recursive pattern learned a diversity of company names absent from Yago. [sent-254, score-0.439]
</p><p>87 3 Human-Based Supertype Evaluation In this section, we discuss the results of harvesting the supertypes of the learned arguments. [sent-338, score-0.622]
</p><p>88 Figure 3 shows the top 100 ranked supertypes for the “cause ” and “work on ” relations. [sent-339, score-0.483]
</p><p>89 The decline of the curve indicates that certain supertypes are preferred and shared among different argument pairs. [sent-342, score-0.544]
</p><p>90 These most-popular harvested types tend to be the more descriptive terms. [sent-344, score-0.259]
</p><p>91 The results indicate that one does not need an elaborate supertype hierarchy to handle the selectional restrictions of semantic relations. [sent-345, score-0.62]
</p><p>92 Since our problem definition differs from avail-  able related work, and WordNet does not contain all harvested arguments as shown in (Hovy et al. [sent-346, score-0.479]
</p><p>93 Instead, we conduct a manual evaluation of the most highly ranked supertypes which normally are the top 20. [sent-348, score-0.483]
</p><p>94 The overall accuracy of the supertypes for all relations is 92%. [sent-349, score-0.507]
</p><p>95 top 10 highly ranked supertypes for six of our relations. [sent-351, score-0.483]
</p><p>96 7  Conclusion  We propose a minimally supervised algorithm that uses only one seed example and a recursive lexicosyntactic pattern to learn in bootstrapping fashion the selectional restrictions of a large class of semantic relations. [sent-352, score-1.032]
</p><p>97 For two of the relations, we compare results with the freely available ontology Yago, and conduct a manual evaluation of the harvested terms. [sent-357, score-0.259]
</p><p>98 We will release the annotated and the harvested data to the public to be used for comparison by other knowledge harvesting algorithms. [sent-358, score-0.464]
</p><p>99 We plan to use the algorithm described in this paper to learn the selectional restrictions of numerous other relations, in order to build a rich knowledge repository 1489  that can support a variety of applications, including textual entailment, information extraction, and question answering.

<p>Author: Zornitsa Kozareva ; Eduard Hovy</p><p>Abstract: A challenging problem in open information extraction and text mining is the learning of the selectional restrictions of semantic relations. We propose a minimally supervised bootstrapping algorithm that uses a single seed and a recursive lexico-syntactic pattern to learn the arguments and the supertypes of a diverse set of semantic relations from the Web. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on multiple semantic relations expressed using “verb”, “noun”, and “verb prep” lexico-syntactic patterns. Humanbased evaluation shows that the accuracy of the harvested information is about 90%.

<p>Author: Alan Ritter ; Mausam Mausam ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: The computation of selectional preferences, the admissible argument values for a relation, is a well-known NLP task with broad applicability. We present LDA-SP, which utilizes LinkLDA (Erosheva et al., 2004) to model selectional preferences. By simultaneously inferring latent topics and topic distributions over relations, LDA-SP combines the benefits of previous approaches: like traditional classbased approaches, it produces humaninterpretable classes describing each relation’s preferences, but it is competitive with non-class-based methods in predictive power. We compare LDA-SP to several state-ofthe-art methods achieving an 85% increase in recall at 0.9 precision over mutual information (Erk, 2007). We also evaluate LDA-SP’s effectiveness at filtering improper applications of inference rules, where we show substantial improvement over Pantel et al. ’s system (Pantel et al., 2007).</p><p>3 0.19808187 <a title="160-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-On_Learning_Subtypes_of_the_Part-Whole_Relation%3A_Do_Not_Mix_Your_Seeds.html">181 acl-2010-On Learning Subtypes of the Part-Whole Relation: Do Not Mix Your Seeds</a></p>
<p>Author: Ashwin Ittoo ; Gosse Bouma</p><p>Abstract: An important relation in information extraction is the part-whole relation. Ontological studies mention several types of this relation. In this paper, we show that the traditional practice of initializing minimally-supervised algorithms with a single set that mixes seeds of different types fails to capture the wide variety of part-whole patterns and tuples. The results obtained with mixed seeds ultimately converge to one of the part-whole relation types. We also demonstrate that all the different types of part-whole relations can still be discovered, regardless of the type characterized by the initializing seeds. We performed our experiments with a state-ofthe-art information extraction algorithm. 1</p><p>4 0.15350765 <a title="160-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Fully_Unsupervised_Core-Adjunct_Argument_Classification.html">120 acl-2010-Fully Unsupervised Core-Adjunct Argument Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Omri Abend ; Ari Rappoport</p><p>Abstract: The core-adjunct argument distinction is a basic one in the theory of argument structure. The task of distinguishing between the two has strong relations to various basic NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing, semantic role labeling and subcategorization acquisition. This paper presents a novel unsupervised algorithm for the task that uses no supervised models, utilizing instead state-of-the-art syntactic induction algorithms. This is the first work to tackle this task in a fully unsupervised scenario.</p><p>5 0.14895216 <a title="160-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Inducing_Domain-Specific_Semantic_Class_Taggers_from_%28Almost%29_Nothing.html">150 acl-2010-Inducing Domain-Specific Semantic Class Taggers from (Almost) Nothing</a></p>
<p>Author: Ruihong Huang ; Ellen Riloff</p><p>Abstract: This research explores the idea of inducing domain-specific semantic class taggers using only a domain-specific text collection and seed words. The learning process begins by inducing a classifier that only has access to contextual features, forcing it to generalize beyond the seeds. The contextual classifier then labels new instances, to expand and diversify the training set. Next, a cross-category bootstrapping process simultaneously trains a suite of classifiers for multiple semantic classes. The positive instances for one class are used as negative instances for the others in an iterative bootstrapping cycle. We also explore a one-semantic-class-per-discourse heuristic, and use the classifiers to dynam- ically create semantic features. We evaluate our approach by inducing six semantic taggers from a collection of veterinary medicine message board posts.</p><p>6 0.14217059 <a title="160-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Beyond_NomBank%3A_A_Study_of_Implicit_Arguments_for_Nominal_Predicates.html">49 acl-2010-Beyond NomBank: A Study of Implicit Arguments for Nominal Predicates</a></p>

<p>Author: Partha Pratim Talukdar ; Fernando Pereira</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms have been successfully used to extract class-instance pairs from large unstructured and structured text collections. However, a careful comparison of different graph-based SSL algorithms on that task has been lacking. We compare three graph-based SSL algorithms for class-instance acquisition on a variety of graphs constructed from different domains. We find that the recently proposed MAD algorithm is the most effective. We also show that class-instance extraction can be significantly improved by adding semantic information in the form of instance-attribute edges derived from an independently developed knowledge base. All of our code and data will be made publicly available to encourage reproducible research in this area.</p><p>4 0.69877762 <a title="160-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Hunting_for_the_Black_Swan%3A_Risk_Mining_from_Text.html">138 acl-2010-Hunting for the Black Swan: Risk Mining from Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Jochen Leidner ; Frank Schilder</p><p>Abstract: In the business world, analyzing and dealing with risk permeates all decisions and actions. However, to date, risk identification, the first step in the risk management cycle, has always been a manual activity with little to no intelligent software tool support. In addition, although companies are required to list risks to their business in their annual SEC filings in the USA, these descriptions are often very highlevel and vague. In this paper, we introduce Risk Mining, which is the task of identifying a set of risks pertaining to a business area or entity. We argue that by combining Web mining and Information Extraction (IE) techniques, risks can be detected automatically before they materialize, thus providing valuable business intelligence. We describe a system that induces a risk taxonomy with concrete risks (e.g., interest rate changes) at its leaves and more abstract risks (e.g., financial risks) closer to its root node. The taxonomy is induced via a bootstrapping algorithms starting with a few seeds. The risk taxonomy is used by the system as input to a risk monitor that matches risk mentions in financial documents to the abstract risk types, thus bridging a lexical gap. Our system is able to automatically generate company specific “risk maps”, which we demonstrate for a corpus of earnings report conference calls.</p><p>5 0.67490578 <a title="160-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Automatically_Generating_Term_Frequency_Induced_Taxonomies.html">43 acl-2010-Automatically Generating Term Frequency Induced Taxonomies</a></p>

Previous work mainly focused on the selection of either the source side of a hierarchical rule or the target side of a hierarchical rule rather than considering both of them simultaneously. This paper presents a joint model to predict the selection of hierarchical rules. The proposed model is estimated based on four sub-models where the rich context knowledge from both source and target sides is leveraged. Our method can be easily incorporated into the practical SMT systems with the log-linear model framework.

<p>Author: Celina Santamaria ; Julio Gonzalo ; Javier Artiles</p><p>Abstract: Is it possible to use sense inventories to improve Web search results diversity for one word queries? To answer this question, we focus on two broad-coverage lexical resources of a different nature: WordNet, as a de-facto standard used in Word Sense Disambiguation experiments; and Wikipedia, as a large coverage, updated encyclopaedic resource which may have a better coverage of relevant senses in Web pages. Our results indicate that (i) Wikipedia has a much better coverage of search results, (ii) the distribution of senses in search results can be estimated using the internal graph structure of the Wikipedia and the relative number of visits received by each sense in Wikipedia, and (iii) associating Web pages to Wikipedia senses with simple and efficient algorithms, we can produce modified rankings that cover 70% more Wikipedia senses than the original search engine rankings. 1 Motivation The application of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) to Information Retrieval (IR) has been subject of a significant research effort in the recent past. The essential idea is that, by indexing and matching word senses (or even meanings) , the retrieval process could better handle polysemy and synonymy problems (Sanderson, 2000). In practice, however, there are two main difficulties: (i) for long queries, IR models implicitly perform disambiguation, and thus there is little room for improvement. This is the case with most standard IR benchmarks, such as TREC (trec.nist.gov) or CLEF (www.clef-campaign.org) ad-hoc collections; (ii) for very short queries, disambiguation j ul io @ l i uned . e s j avart s . @bec . uned . e s may not be possible or even desirable. This is often the case with one word and even two word queries in Web search engines. In Web search, there are at least three ways of coping with ambiguity: • • • Promoting diversity in the search results (Clarke negt al., 2008): given th seea query s”uolatssis”, the search engine may try to include representatives for different senses of the word (such as the Oasis band, the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards, the online fashion store, etc.) among the top results. Search engines are supposed to handle diversity as one of the multiple factors that influence the ranking. Presenting the results as a set of (labelled) cPlruessteenrtsi nragth tehre eth reansu as a a rsan ake sde lti ostf (Carpineto et al., 2009). Complementing search results with search suggestions (e.g. e”oaracshis band”, ”woitahsis s fashion store”) that serve to refine the query in the intended way (Anick, 2003). All of them rely on the ability of the search engine to cluster search results, detecting topic similarities. In all of them, disambiguation is implicit, a side effect of the process but not its explicit target. Clustering may detect that documents about the Oasis band and the Oasis fashion store deal with unrelated topics, but it may as well detect a group of documents discussing why one of the Oasis band members is leaving the band, and another group of documents about Oasis band lyrics; both are different aspects of the broad topic Oasis band. A perfect hierarchical clustering should distinguish between the different Oasis senses at a first level, and then discover different topics within each of the senses. Is it possible to use sense inventories to improve search results for one word queries? To answer 1357 Proce dingUsp opfs thaela 4, 8Stwhe Adnen u,a 1l1- M16e Jtiunlgy o 2f0 t1h0e. A ?c s 2o0c1ia0ti Aosnso focria Ctio nm fpourta Ctoiomnpault Laitniognuaislt Licisn,g puaigsetisc 1s357–136 , this question, we will focus on two broad-coverage lexical resources of a different nature: WordNet (Miller et al., 1990), as a de-facto standard used in Word Sense Disambiguation experiments and many other Natural Language Processing research fields; and Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.org), as a large coverage and updated encyclopedic resource which may have a better coverage of relevant senses in Web pages. Our hypothesis is that, under appropriate conditions, any of the above mechanisms (clustering, search suggestions, diversity) might benefit from an explicit disambiguation (classification of pages in the top search results) using a wide-coverage sense inventory. Our research is focused on four relevant aspects of the problem: 1. Coverage: Are Wikipedia/Wordnet senses representative of search results? Otherwise, trying to make a disambiguation in terms of a fixed sense inventory would be meaningless. 2. If the answer to (1) is positive, the reverse question is also interesting: can we estimate search results diversity using our sense inven- tories? 3. Sense frequencies: knowing sense frequencies in (search results) Web pages is crucial to have a usable sense inventory. Is it possible to estimate Web sense frequencies from currently available information? 4. Classification: The association of Web pages to word senses must be done with some unsupervised algorithm, because it is not possible to hand-tag training material for every possible query word. Can this classification be done accurately? Can it be effective to promote diversity in search results? In order to provide an initial answer to these questions, we have built a corpus consisting of 40 nouns and 100 Google search results per noun, manually annotated with the most appropriate Wordnet and Wikipedia senses. Section 2 describes how this corpus has been created, and in Section 3 we discuss WordNet and Wikipedia coverage of search results according to our testbed. As this initial results clearly discard Wordnet as a sense inventory for the task, the rest of the paper mainly focuses on Wikipedia. In Section 4 we estimate search results diversity from our testbed, finding that the use of Wikipedia could substantially improve diversity in the top results. In Section 5 we use the Wikipedia internal link structure and the number of visits per page to estimate relative frequencies for Wikipedia senses, obtaining an estimation which is highly correlated with actual data in our testbed. Finally, in Section 6 we discuss a few strategies to classify Web pages into word senses, and apply the best classifier to enhance diversity in search results. The paper concludes with a discussion of related work (Section 7) and an overall discussion of our results in Section 8. 2 Test Set 2.1 Set of Words The most crucial step in building our test set is choosing the set of words to be considered. We are looking for words which are susceptible to form a one-word query for a Web search engine, and therefore we should focus on nouns which are used to denote one or more named entities. At the same time we want to have some degree of comparability with previous research on Word Sense Disambiguation, which points to noun sets used in Senseval/SemEval evaluation campaigns1 . Our budget for corpus annotation was enough for two persons-month, which limited us to handle 40 nouns (usually enough to establish statistically significant differences between WSD algorithms, although obviously limited to reach solid figures about the general behaviour of words in the Web). With these arguments in mind, we decided to choose: (i) 15 nouns from the Senseval-3 lexical sample dataset, which have been previously employed by (Mihalcea, 2007) in a related experiment (see Section 7); (ii) 25 additional words which satisfy two conditions: they are all ambiguous, and they are all names for music bands in one of their senses (not necessarily the most salient). The Senseval set is: {argument, arm, atmosphere, bank, degree, difference, disc, irmm-, age, paper, party, performance, plan, shelter, sort, source}. The bands set is {amazon, apple, camel, cell, columbia, cream, foreigner, fox, genesis, jaguar, oasis, pioneer, police, puma, rainbow, shell, skin, sun, tesla, thunder, total, traffic, trapeze, triumph, yes}. Fpoerz e,a trchiu noun, we looked up all its possible senses in WordNet 3.0 and in Wikipedia (using 1http://senseval.org 1358 Table 1: Coverage of Search Results: Wikipedia vs. WordNet Wikiped#ia documents # senses WordNe#t documents Senseval setava2il4a2b/1le0/u0sedassign8e7d7 to (5 s9o%me) senseavai9la2b/5le2/usedassigne6d96 to (4 s6o%m)e sense # senses BaTnodtsa lset868420//21774421323558 ((5546%%))17780/3/9911529995 (2 (342%%)) Wikipedia disambiguation pages). Wikipedia has an average of 22 senses per noun (25.2 in the Bands set and 16. 1in the Senseval set), and Wordnet a much smaller figure, 4.5 (3. 12 for the Bands set and 6.13 for the Senseval set). For a conventional dictionary, a higher ambiguity might indicate an excess of granularity; for an encyclopaedic resource such as Wikipedia, however, it is just an indication of larger coverage. Wikipedia en- tries for camel which are not in WordNet, for instance, include the Apache Camel routing and mediation engine, the British rock band, the brand of cigarettes, the river in Cornwall, and the World World War I fighter biplane. 2.2 Set of Documents We retrieved the 150 first ranked documents for each noun, by submitting the nouns as queries to a Web search engine (Google). Then, for each document, we stored both the snippet (small description of the contents of retrieved document) and the whole HTML document. This collection of documents contain an implicit new inventory of senses, based on Web search, as documents retrieved by a noun query are associated with some sense of the noun. Given that every document in the top Web search results is supposed to be highly relevant for the query word, we assume a ”one sense per document” scenario, although we allow annotators to assign more than one sense per document. In general this assumption turned out to be correct except in a few exceptional cases (such as Wikipedia disambiguation pages): only nine docu- ments received more than one WordNet sense, and 44 (1. 1% of all annotated pages) received more than one Wikipedia sense. 2.3 Manual Annotation We implemented an annotation interface which stored all documents and a short description for every Wordnet and Wikipedia sense. The annotators had to decide, for every document, whether there was one or more appropriate senses in each of the dictionaries. They were instructed to provide annotations for 100 documents per name; if an URL in the list was corrupt or not available, it had to be discarded. We provided 150 documents per name to ensure that the figure of 100 usable documents per name could be reached without problems. Each judge provided annotations for the 4,000 documents in the final data set. In a second round, they met and discussed their independent annotations together, reaching a consensus judgement for every document. 3 Coverage of Web Search Results: Wikipedia vs Wordnet Table 1 shows how Wikipedia and Wordnet cover the senses in search results. We report each noun subset separately (Senseval and bands subsets) as well as aggregated figures. The most relevant fact is that, unsurprisingly, Wikipedia senses cover much more search results (56%) than Wordnet (32%). If we focus on the top ten results, in the bands subset (which should be more representative of plausible web queries) Wikipedia covers 68% of the top ten documents. This is an indication that it can indeed be useful for promoting diversity or help clustering search results: even if 32% of the top ten documents are not covered by Wikipedia, it is still a representative source of senses in the top search results. We have manually examined all documents in the top ten results that are not covered by Wikipedia: a majority of the missing senses consists of names of (generally not well-known) companies (45%) and products or services (26%); the other frequent type (12%) of non annotated doc- ument is disambiguation pages (from Wikipedia and also from other dictionaries). It is also interesting to examine the degree of overlap between Wikipedia and Wordnet senses. Being two different types of lexical resource, they might have some degree of complementarity. Table 2 shows, however, that this is not the case: most of the (annotated) documents either fit Wikipedia senses (26%) or both Wikipedia and Wordnet (29%), and just 3% fit Wordnet only. 1359 Table 2: Overlap between Wikipedia and Wordnet in Search Results # documents annotated with Senseval setWikipe60di7a ( &40 W%o)rdnetWi2k7ip0e (d1i8a% on)lyWo8r9d (n6e%t o)nly534no (3n6e%) BaTnodtsa slet1517729 ( (2239%%))1708566 (3 (216%%))12176 ( (13%%))11614195 ( (4415%%)) Therefore, Wikipedia seems to extend the coverage of Wordnet rather than providing complementary sense information. If we wanted to extend the coverage of Wikipedia, the best strategy seems to be to consider lists ofcompanies, products and services, rather than complementing Wikipedia with additional sense inventories. 4 Diversity in Google Search Results Once we know that Wikipedia senses are a representative subset of actual Web senses (covering more than half of the documents retrieved by the search engine), we can test how well search results respect diversity in terms of this subset of senses. Table 3 displays the number of different senses found at different depths in the search results rank, and the average proportion of total senses that they represent. These results suggest that diversity is not a major priority for ranking results: the top ten results only cover, in average, 3 Wikipedia senses (while the average number of senses listed in Wikipedia is 22). When considering the first 100 documents, this number grows up to 6.85 senses per noun. Another relevant figure is the frequency of the most frequent sense for each word: in average, 63% of the pages in search results belong to the most frequent sense of the query word. This is roughly comparable with most frequent sense figures in standard annotated corpora such as Semcor (Miller et al., 1993) and the Senseval/Semeval data sets, which suggests that diversity may not play a major role in the current Google ranking algorithm. Of course this result must be taken with care, because variability between words is high and unpredictable, and we are using only 40 nouns for our experiment. But what we have is a positive indication that Wikipedia could be used to improve diversity or cluster search results: potentially the first top ten results could cover 6.15 different senses in average (see Section 6.5), which would be a substantial growth. 5 Sense Frequency Estimators for Wikipedia Wikipedia disambiguation pages contain no systematic information about the relative importance of senses for a given word. Such information, however, is crucial in a lexicon, because sense distributions tend to be skewed, and knowing them can help disambiguation algorithms. We have attempted to use two estimators of expected sense distribution: • • Internal relevance of a word sense, measured as incoming alinnckes o ffo ar wthoer U seRnLs o, fm a given sense in Wikipedia. External relevance of a word sense, measured as ttheren naulm rebleevr aonfc vei osifts a f woro trhde s eUnRsLe, mofe a given sense (as reported in http://stats.grok.se). The number of internal incoming links is expected to be relatively stable for Wikipedia articles. As for the number of visits, we performed a comparison of the number of visits received by the bands noun subset in May, June and July 2009, finding a stable-enough scenario with one notorious exception: the number of visits to the noun Tesla raised dramatically in July, because July 10 was the anniversary of the birth of Nicola Tesla, and a special Google logo directed users to the Wikipedia page for the scientist. We have measured correlation between the relative frequencies derived from these two indicators and the actual relative frequencies in our testbed. Therefore, for each noun w and for each sense wi, we consider three values: (i) proportion of documents retrieved for w which are manually assigned to each sense wi; (ii) inlinks(wi) : relative amount of incoming links to each sense wi; and (iii) visits(wi) : relative number of visits to the URL for each sense wi. We have measured the correlation between these three values using a linear regression correlation coefficient, which gives a correlation value of .54 for the number of visits and of .71 for the number of incoming links. Both estimators seem 1360 Table 3: Diversity in Search Results according to Wikipedia F ir s t 12570 docsBave6n425.rd9854a6 s8get#snSe 65sien43. v68a3s27elarcthesTu6543l.o t5083as5lBvaen.r3d2a73s81gectovrSaegnso. 4f32v615aWlsiketpdaTs.3oe249tn01asle to be positively correlated with real relative frequencies in our testbed, with a strong preference for the number of links. We have experimented with weighted combinations of both indicators, using weights of the form (k, 1 k) , k ∈ {0, 0.1, 0.2 . . . 1}, reaching a maxi(mk,a1l c−okrre),lkati ∈on { 0of, .07.13, f0o.r2 t.h.e. following weights: − freq(wi) = 0.9∗inlinks(wi) +0. 1∗visits(wi) (1) This weighted estimator provides a slight advantage over the use of incoming links only (.73 vs .71). Overall, we have an estimator which has a strong correlation with the distribution of senses in our testbed. In the next section we will test its utility for disambiguation purposes. 6 Association of Wikipedia Senses to Web Pages We want to test whether the information provided by Wikipedia can be used to classify search results accurately. Note that we do not want to consider approaches that involve a manual creation of training material, because they can’t be used in practice. Given a Web page p returned by the search engine for the query w, and the set of senses w1 . . . wn listed in Wikipedia, the task is to assign the best candidate sense to p. We consider two different techniques: • A basic Information Retrieval approach, wAhe breas tche I dfoocrmumateionnts Ranetdr tvhael Wikipedia pages are represented using a Vector Space Model (VSM) and compared with a standard cosine measure. This is a basic approach which, if successful, can be used efficiently to classify search results. An approach based on a state-of-the-art supervised oWacShD b system, extracting training examples automatically from Wikipedia content. We also compute two baselines: • • • A random assignment of senses (precision is computed as itghnem ienvnter osfe oenfs tehse ( pnruemcibsieorn o isf senses, for every test case). A most frequent sense heuristic which uses our eosstitm fraetiqoune otf s sense frequencies acnhd u assigns the same sense (the most frequent) to all documents. Both are naive baselines, but it must be noted that the most frequent sense heuristic is usually hard to beat for unsupervised WSD algorithms in most standard data sets. We now describe each of the two main approaches in detail. 6.1 VSM Approach For each word sense, we represent its Wikipedia page in a (unigram) vector space model, assigning standard tf*idf weights to the words in the document. idf weights are computed in two different ways: 1. Experiment VSM computes inverse document frequencies in the collection of retrieved documents (for the word being considered). 2. Experiment VSM-GT uses the statistics provided by the Google Terabyte collection (Brants and Franz, 2006), i.e. it replaces the collection of documents with statistics from a representative snapshot of the Web. 3. Experiment VSM-mixed combines statistics from the collection and from the Google Terabyte collection, following (Chen et al., 2009). The document p is represented in the same vector space as the Wikipedia senses, and it is compared with each of the candidate senses wi via the cosine similarity metric (we have experimented 1361 with other similarity metrics such as χ2, but differences are irrelevant). The sense with the highest similarity to p is assigned to the document. In case of ties (which are rare), we pick the first sense in the Wikipedia disambiguation page (which in practice is like a random decision, because senses in disambiguation pages do not seem to be ordered according to any clear criteria). We have also tested a variant of this approach which uses the estimation of sense frequencies presented above: once the similarities are computed, we consider those cases where two or more senses have a similar score (in particular, all senses with a score greater or equal than 80% of the highest score). In that cases, instead of using the small similarity differences to select a sense, we pick up the one which has the largest frequency according to our estimator. We have applied this strategy to the best performing system, VSM-GT, resulting in experiment VSM-GT+freq. 6.2 WSD Approach We have used TiMBL (Daelemans et al., 2001), a state-of-the-art supervised WSD system which uses Memory-Based Learning. The key, in this case, is how to extract learning examples from the Wikipedia automatically. For each word sense, we basically have three sources of examples: (i) occurrences of the word in the Wikipedia page for the word sense; (ii) occurrences of the word in Wikipedia pages pointing to the page for the word sense; (iii) occurrences of the word in external pages linked in the Wikipedia page for the word sense. After an initial manual inspection, we decided to discard external pages for being too noisy, and we focused on the first two options. We tried three alternatives: • • • TiMBL-core uses only the examples found Tini MtheB page rfoer u tshees sense being atrmaipneleds. TiMBL-inlinks uses the examples found in Wikipedia pages pointing etxoa mthep sense being trained. TiMBL-all uses both sources of examples. In order to classify a page p with respect to the senses for a word w, we first disambiguate all occurrences of w in the page p. Then we choose the sense which appears most frequently in the page according to TiMBL results. In case of ties we pick up the first sense listed in the Wikipedia disambiguation page. We have also experimented with a variant of the approach that uses our estimation of sense frequencies, similarly to what we did with the VSM approach. In this case, (i) when there is a tie between two or more senses (which is much more likely than in the VSM approach), we pick up the sense with the highest frequency according to our estimator; and (ii) when no sense reaches 30% of the cases in the page to be disambiguated, we also resort to the most frequent sense heuristic (among the candidates for the page). This experiment is called TiMBL-core+freq (we discarded ”inlinks” and ”all” versions because they were clearly worse than ”core”). 6.3 Classification Results Table 4 shows classification results. The accuracy of systems is reported as precision, i.e. the number of pages correctly classified divided by the total number of predictions. This is approximately the same as recall (correctly classified pages divided by total number of pages) for our systems, because the algorithms provide an answer for every page containing text (actual coverage is 94% because some pages only contain text as part of an image file such as photographs and logotypes). Table 4: Classification Results Experiment Precision random most frequent sense (estimation) .19 .46 TiMBL-core TiMBL-inlinks TiMBL-all TiMBL-core+freq .60 .50 .58 .67 VSM VSM-GT VSM-mixed VSM-GT+freq .67 .68 .67 .69 All systems are significantly better than the random and most frequent sense baselines (using p < 0.05 for a standard t-test). Overall, both approaches (using TiMBL WSD machinery and using VSM) lead to similar results (.67 vs. .69), which would make VSM preferable because it is a simpler and more efficient approach. Taking a 1362 Figure 1: Precision/Coverage curves for VSM-GT+freq classification algorithm closer look at the results with TiMBL, there are a couple of interesting facts: • There is a substantial difference between using only examples itaalke dnif fferroemnc tehe b Wikipedia Web page for the sense being trained (TiMBL-core, .60) and using examples from the Wikipedia pages pointing to that page (TiMBL-inlinks, .50). Examples taken from related pages (even if the relationship is close as in this case) seem to be too noisy for the task. This result is compatible with findings in (Santamar ı´a et al., 2003) using the Open Directory Project to extract examples automatically. • Our estimation of sense frequencies turns oOuutr rto e tbiem very helpful sfeor f cases wcihesere t our TiMBL-based algorithm cannot provide an answer: precision rises from .60 (TiMBLcore) to .67 (TiMBL-core+freq). The difference is statistically significant (p < 0.05) according to the t-test. As for the experiments with VSM, the variations tested do not provide substantial improvements to the baseline (which is .67). Using idf frequencies obtained from the Google Terabyte corpus (instead of frequencies obtained from the set of retrieved documents) provides only a small improvement (VSM-GT, .68), and adding the estimation of sense frequencies gives another small improvement (.69). Comparing the baseline VSM with the optimal setting (VSM-GT+freq), the difference is small (.67 vs .69) but relatively robust (p = 0.066 according to the t-test). Remarkably, the use of frequency estimations is very helpful for the WSD approach but not for the SVM one, and they both end up with similar performance figures; this might indicate that using frequency estimations is only helpful up to certain precision ceiling. 6.4 Precision/Coverage Trade-off All the above experiments are done at maximal coverage, i.e., all systems assign a sense for every document in the test collection (at least for every document with textual content). But it is possible to enhance search results diversity without annotating every document (in fact, not every document can be assigned to a Wikipedia sense, as we have discussed in Section 3). Thus, it is useful to investigate which is the precision/coverage trade-off in our dataset. We have experimented with the best performing system (VSM-GT+freq), introducing a similarity threshold: assignment of a document to a sense is only done if the similarity of the document to the Wikipedia page for the sense exceeds the similarity threshold. We have computed precision and coverage for every threshold in the range [0.00 −0.90] (beyond 0e.v9e0ry coverage was null) anngde represented 0th] e(b breeysuolntds in Figure 1 (solid line). The graph shows that we 1363 can classify around 20% of the documents with a precision above .90, and around 60% of the documents with a precision of .80. Note that we are reporting disambiguation results using a conventional WSD test set, i.e., one in which every test case (every document) has been manually assigned to some Wikipedia sense. But in our Web Search scenario, 44% of the documents were not assigned to any Wikipedia sense: in practice, our classification algorithm would have to cope with all this noise as well. Figure 1 (dotted line) shows how the precision/coverage curve is affected when the algorithm attempts to disambiguate all documents retrieved by Google, whether they can in fact be assigned to a Wikipedia sense or not. At a coverage of 20%, precision drops approximately from .90 to .70, and at a coverage of 60% it drops from .80 to .50. We now address the question of whether this performance is good enough to improve search re- sults diversity in practice. 6.5 Using Classification to Promote Diversity We now want to estimate how the reported classification accuracy may perform in practice to enhance diversity in search results. In order to provide an initial answer to this question, we have re-ranked the documents for the 40 nouns in our testbed, using our best classifier (VSM-GT+freq) and making a list of the top-ten documents with the primary criterion of maximising the number of senses represented in the set, and the secondary criterion of maximising the similarity scores of the documents to their assigned senses. The algorithm proceeds as follows: we fill each position in the rank (starting at rank 1), with the document which has the highest similarity to some of the senses which are not yet represented in the rank; once all senses are represented, we start choosing a second representative for each sense, following the same criterion. The process goes on until the first ten documents are selected. We have also produced a number of alternative rankings for comparison purposes: clustering (centroids): this method applies eHriiengrarc (hciecnatlr Agglomerative Clustering which proved to be the most competitive clustering algorithm in a similar task (Artiles et al., 2009) to the set of search results, forcing the algorithm to create ten clusters. The centroid of each cluster is then selected Table 5: Enhancement of Search Results Diversity • – – rank@10 # senses coverage Original rank2.8049% Wikipedia 4.75 77% clustering (centroids) 2.50 42% clustering (top ranked) 2.80 46% random 2.45 43% upper bound6.1597% as one of the top ten documents in the new rank. • clustering (top ranked): Applies the same clustering algorithm, db u)t: tAhpisp lti emse t tehe s top ranked document (in the original Google rank) of each cluster is selected. • • random: Randomly selects ten documents frraonmd otmhe: :se Rt aofn dreomtrielyve sde lreecstuslts te. upper bound: This is the maximal diversity tuhpapt can o beu nodb:tai Tnheids iins our mteasxtbiemda. lN doivteer tshitayt coverage is not 100%, because some words have more than ten meanings in Wikipedia and we are only considering the top ten documents. All experiments have been applied on the full set of documents in the testbed, including those which could not be annotated with any Wikipedia sense. Coverage is computed as the ratio of senses that appear in the top ten results compared to the number of senses that appear in all search results. Results are presented in Table 5. Note that diversity in the top ten documents increases from an average of 2.80 Wikipedia senses represented in the original search engine rank, to 4.75 in the modified rank (being 6.15 the upper bound), with the coverage of senses going from 49% to 77%. With a simple VSM algorithm, the coverage of Wikipedia senses in the top ten results is 70% larger than in the original ranking. Using Wikipedia to enhance diversity seems to work much better than clustering: both strategies to select a representative from each cluster are unable to improve the diversity of the original ranking. Note, however, that our evaluation has a bias towards using Wikipedia, because only Wikipedia senses are considered to estimate diversity. Of course our results do not imply that the Wikipedia modified rank is better than the original 1364 Google rank: there are many other factors that influence the final ranking provided by a search engine. What our results indicate is that, with simple and efficient algorithms, Wikipedia can be used as a reference to improve search results diversity for one-word queries. 7 Related Work Web search results clustering and diversity in search results are topics that receive an increasing attention from the research community. Diversity is used both to represent sub-themes in a broad topic, or to consider alternative interpretations for ambiguous queries (Agrawal et al., 2009), which is our interest here. Standard IR test collections do not usually consider ambiguous queries, and are thus inappropriate to test systems that promote diversity (Sanderson, 2008); it is only recently that appropriate test collections are being built, such as (Paramita et al., 2009) for image search and (Artiles et al., 2009) for person name search. We see our testbed as complementary to these ones, and expect that it can contribute to foster research on search results diversity. To our knowledge, Wikipedia has not explicitly been used before to promote diversity in search results; but in (Gollapudi and Sharma, 2009), it is used as a gold standard to evaluate diversification algorithms: given a query with a Wikipedia disambiguation page, an algorithm is evaluated as promoting diversity when different documents in the search results are semantically similar to different Wikipedia pages (describing the alternative senses of the query). Although semantic similarity is measured automatically in this work, our results confirm that this evaluation strategy is sound, because Wikipedia senses are indeed representative of search results. (Clough et al., 2009) analyses query diversity in a Microsoft Live Search, using click entropy and query reformulation as diversity indicators. It was found that at least 9.5% - 16.2% of queries could benefit from diversification, although no correlation was found between the number of senses of a word in Wikipedia and the indicators used to discover diverse queries. This result does not discard, however, that queries where applying diversity is useful cannot benefit from Wikipedia as a sense inventory. In the context of clustering, (Carmel et al., 2009) successfully employ Wikipedia to enhance automatic cluster labeling, finding that Wikipedia labels agree with manual labels associated by humans to a cluster, much more than with signif- icant terms that are extracted directly from the text. In a similar line, both (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) and (Syed et al., 2008) provide evidence suggesting that categories of Wikipedia articles can successfully describe common concepts in documents. In the field of Natural Language Processing, there has been successful attempts to connect Wikipedia entries to Wordnet senses: (RuizCasado et al., 2005) reports an algorithm that provides an accuracy of 84%. (Mihalcea, 2007) uses internal Wikipedia hyperlinks to derive sensetagged examples. But instead of using Wikipedia directly as sense inventory, Mihalcea then manually maps Wikipedia senses into Wordnet senses (claiming that, at the time of writing the paper, Wikipedia did not consistently report ambiguity in disambiguation pages) and shows that a WSD system based on acquired sense-tagged examples reaches an accuracy well beyond an (informed) most frequent sense heuristic. 8 Conclusions We have investigated whether generic lexical resources can be used to promote diversity in Web search results for one-word, ambiguous queries. We have compared WordNet and Wikipedia and arrived to a number of conclusions: (i) unsurprisingly, Wikipedia has a much better coverage of senses in search results, and is therefore more appropriate for the task; (ii) the distribution of senses in search results can be estimated using the internal graph structure of the Wikipedia and the relative number of visits received by each sense in Wikipedia, and (iii) associating Web pages to Wikipedia senses with simple and efficient algorithms, we can produce modified rankings that cover 70% more Wikipedia senses than the original search engine rankings. We expect that the testbed created for this research will complement the - currently short - set of benchmarking test sets to explore search results diversity and query ambiguity. Our testbed is publicly available for research purposes at http://nlp.uned.es. Our results endorse further investigation on the use of Wikipedia to organize search results. Some limitations of our research, however, must be 1365 noted: (i) the nature of our testbed (with every search result manually annotated in terms of two sense inventories) makes it too small to extract solid conclusions on Web searches (ii) our work does not involve any study of diversity from the point of view of Web users (i.e. when a Web query addresses many different use needs in practice); research in (Clough et al., 2009) suggests that word ambiguity in Wikipedia might not be related with diversity of search needs; (iii) we have tested our classifiers with a simple re-ordering of search results to test how much diversity can be improved, but a search results ranking depends on many other factors, some of them more crucial than diversity; it remains to be tested how can we use document/Wikipedia associations to improve search results clustering (for instance, providing seeds for the clustering process) and to provide search suggestions.

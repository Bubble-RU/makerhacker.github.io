<p>Author: Bin Wei ; Christopher Pal</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of using an annotated corpus in English for the same natural language processing task in another language. While various machine translation systems are available, automated translation is still far from perfect. To minimize the noise introduced by translations, we propose to use only key ‘reliable” parts from the translations and apply structural correspondence learning (SCL) to find a low dimensional representation shared by the two languages. We perform experiments on an EnglishChinese sentiment classification task and compare our results with a previous cotraining approach. To alleviate the problem of data sparseness, we create extra pseudo-examples for SCL by making queries to a search engine. Experiments on real-world on-line review data demonstrate the two techniques can effectively improvetheperformancecomparedtoprevious work.</p><p>3 0.22027582 <a title="78-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Bilingual_Lexicon_Generation_Using_Non-Aligned_Signatures.html">50 acl-2010-Bilingual Lexicon Generation Using Non-Aligned Signatures</a></p>
<p>Author: Daphna Shezaf ; Ari Rappoport</p><p>Abstract: Bilingual lexicons are fundamental resources. Modern automated lexicon generation methods usually require parallel corpora, which are not available for most language pairs. Lexicons can be generated using non-parallel corpora or a pivot language, but such lexicons are noisy. We present an algorithm for generating a high quality lexicon from a noisy one, which only requires an independent corpus for each language. Our algorithm introduces non-aligned signatures (NAS), a cross-lingual word context similarity score that avoids the over-constrained and inef- ficient nature of alignment-based methods. We use NAS to eliminate incorrect translations from the generated lexicon. We evaluate our method by improving the quality of noisy Spanish-Hebrew lexicons generated from two pivot English lexicons. Our algorithm substantially outperforms other lexicon generation methods.</p><p>4 0.12954997 <a title="78-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Sentiment_Learning_on_Product_Reviews_via_Sentiment_Ontology_Tree.html">209 acl-2010-Sentiment Learning on Product Reviews via Sentiment Ontology Tree</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Wei ; Jon Atle Gulla</p><p>Abstract: Existing works on sentiment analysis on product reviews suffer from the following limitations: (1) The knowledge of hierarchical relationships of products attributes is not fully utilized. (2) Reviews or sentences mentioning several attributes associated with complicated sentiments are not dealt with very well. In this paper, we propose a novel HL-SOT approach to labeling a product’s attributes and their associated sentiments in product reviews by a Hierarchical Learning (HL) process with a defined Sentiment Ontology Tree (SOT). The empirical analysis against a humanlabeled data set demonstrates promising and reasonable performance of the proposed HL-SOT approach. While this paper is mainly on sentiment analysis on reviews of one product, our proposed HLSOT approach is easily generalized to labeling a mix of reviews of more than one products.</p><p>5 0.1280551 <a title="78-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Sentiment_Translation_through_Lexicon_Induction.html">210 acl-2010-Sentiment Translation through Lexicon Induction</a></p>

<p>Author: Sylvain Schmitz</p><p>Abstract: Dominance links were introduced in grammars to model long distance scrambling phenomena, motivating the definition of multiset-valued linear indexed grammars (MLIGs) by Rambow (1994b), and inspiring quite a few recent formalisms. It turns out that MLIGs have since been rediscovered and reused in a variety of contexts, and that the complexity of their emptiness problem has become the key to several open questions in computer science. We survey complexity results and open issues on MLIGs and related formalisms, and provide new complexity bounds for some linguistically motivated restrictions.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.78923005 <a title="78-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Cross-Language_Text_Classification_Using_Structural_Correspondence_Learning.html">78 acl-2010-Cross-Language Text Classification Using Structural Correspondence Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Deyi Xiong ; Min Zhang ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: Automatic error detection is desired in the post-processing to improve machine translation quality. The previous work is largely based on confidence estimation using system-based features, such as word posterior probabilities calculated from Nbest lists or word lattices. We propose to incorporate two groups of linguistic features, which convey information from outside machine translation systems, into error detection: lexical and syntactic features. We use a maximum entropy classifier to predict translation errors by integrating word posterior probability feature and linguistic features. The experimental results show that 1) linguistic features alone outperform word posterior probability based confidence estimation in error detection; and 2) linguistic features can further provide complementary information when combined with word confidence scores, which collectively reduce the classification error rate by 18.52% and improve the F measure by 16.37%.</p><p>5 0.6510247 <a title="78-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Open-Domain_Semantic_Role_Labeling_by_Modeling_Word_Spans.html">184 acl-2010-Open-Domain Semantic Role Labeling by Modeling Word Spans</a></p>
<p>Author: Fei Huang ; Alexander Yates</p><p>Abstract: Most supervised language processing systems show a significant drop-off in performance when they are tested on text that comes from a domain significantly different from the domain of the training data. Semantic role labeling techniques are typically trained on newswire text, and in tests their performance on fiction is as much as 19% worse than their performance on newswire text. We investigate techniques for building open-domain semantic role labeling systems that approach the ideal of a train-once, use-anywhere system. We leverage recently-developed techniques for learning representations of text using latent-variable language models, and extend these techniques to ones that provide the kinds of features that are useful for semantic role labeling. In experiments, our novel system reduces error by 16% relative to the previous state of the art on out-of-domain text.</p><p>6 0.64934403 <a title="78-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Hierarchical_Joint_Learning%3A_Improving_Joint_Parsing_and_Named_Entity_Recognition_with_Non-Jointly_Labeled_Data.html">132 acl-2010-Hierarchical Joint Learning: Improving Joint Parsing and Named Entity Recognition with Non-Jointly Labeled Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Elif Yamangil ; Stuart M. Shieber</p><p>Abstract: We describe our experiments with training algorithms for tree-to-tree synchronous tree-substitution grammar (STSG) for monolingual translation tasks such as sentence compression and paraphrasing. These translation tasks are characterized by the relative ability to commit to parallel parse trees and availability of word alignments, yet the unavailability of large-scale data, calling for a Bayesian tree-to-tree formalism. We formalize nonparametric Bayesian STSG with epsilon alignment in full generality, and provide a Gibbs sampling algorithm for posterior inference tailored to the task of extractive sentence compression. We achieve improvements against a number of baselines, including expectation maximization and variational Bayes training, illustrating the merits of nonparametric inference over the space of grammars as opposed to sparse parametric inference with a fixed grammar.</p><p>3 0.24195287 <a title="21-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Correcting_Errors_in_a_Treebank_Based_on_Synchronous_Tree_Substitution_Grammar.html">75 acl-2010-Correcting Errors in a Treebank Based on Synchronous Tree Substitution Grammar</a></p>

By using a synchronous grammar, the method transforms parse trees containing annotation errors into the ones whose errors are corrected. The synchronous grammar is automatically induced from the treebank. We report an experimental result of applying our method to the Penn Treebank. The result demonstrates that our method corrects syntactic annotation errors with high precision.</p><p>4 0.2283816 <a title="21-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Efficient_Inference_through_Cascades_of_Weighted_Tree_Transducers.html">95 acl-2010-Efficient Inference through Cascades of Weighted Tree Transducers</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan May ; Kevin Knight ; Heiko Vogler</p><p>Abstract: Weighted tree transducers have been proposed as useful formal models for representing syntactic natural language processing applications, but there has been little description of inference algorithms for these automata beyond formal foundations. We give a detailed description of algorithms for application of cascades of weighted tree transducers to weighted tree acceptors, connecting formal theory with actual practice. Additionally, we present novel on-the-fly variants of these algorithms, and compare their performance on a syntax machine translation cascade based on (Yamada and Knight, 2001). 1 Motivation Weighted finite-state transducers have found recent favor as models of natural language (Mohri, 1997). In order to make actual use of systems built with these formalisms we must first calculate the set of possible weighted outputs allowed by the transducer given some input, which we call forward application, or the set of possible weighted inputs given some output, which we call backward application. After application we can do some inference on this result, such as determining its k highest weighted elements. We may also want to divide up our problems into manageable chunks, each represented by a transducer. As noted by Woods (1980), it is easier for designers to write several small transducers where each performs a simple transformation, rather than painstakingly construct a single complicated device. We would like to know, then, the result of transformation of input or output by a cascade of transducers, one operating after the other. As we will see, there are various strategies for approaching this problem. We will consider offline composition, bucket brigade applica- tion, and on-the-fly application. Application of cascades of weighted string transducers (WSTs) has been well-studied (Mohri, Heiko Vogler Technische Universit a¨t Dresden Institut f u¨r Theoretische Informatik 01062 Dresden, Germany he iko .vogle r@ tu-dre s den .de 1997). Less well-studied but of more recent interest is application of cascades of weighted tree transducers (WTTs). We tackle application of WTT cascades in this work, presenting: • • • explicit algorithms for application of WTT casceaxpdelisc novel algorithms for on-the-fly application of nWoTvTe lca alscgoardieths,m mansd f experiments comparing the performance of tehxepseer iamlgeonrtisthm cos.m 2 Strategies for the string case Before we discuss application of WTTs, it is helpful to recall the solution to this problem in the WST domain. We recall previous formal presentations of WSTs (Mohri, 1997) and note informally that they may be represented as directed graphs with designated start and end states and edges labeled with input symbols, output symbols, and weights.1 Fortunately, the solution for WSTs is practically trivial—we achieve application through a series of embedding, composition, and projection operations. Embedding is simply the act of representing a string or regular string language as an identity WST. Composition of WSTs, that is, generating a single WST that captures the transformations of two input WSTs used in sequence, is not at all trivial, but has been well covered in, e.g., (Mohri, 2009), where directly implementable algorithms can be found. Finally, projection is another trivial operation—the domain or range language can be obtained from a WST by ignoring the output or input symbols, respectively, on its arcs, and summing weights on otherwise identical arcs. By embedding an input, composing the result with the given WST, and projecting the result, forward application is accomplished.2 We are then left with a weighted string acceptor (WSA), essentially a weighted, labeled graph, which can be traversed R+1∪W {e+ as∞su}m,te ha thtro thuegh woeuitgh t hi osf p aa ppaetrh t ihsa cta wlceuilgahtetds a asre th ien prod∪uct { +of∞ ∞th}e, wtheaitgh thtes wofe i gtsh etd ogfes a, panatdh t ihsat c athlceu lwateeigdh ats so tfh ae (not necessarily finite) set T of paths is calculated as the sum of the weights of the paths of T. 2For backward applications, the roles of input and output are simply exchanged. 1058 ProceedingUsp opfs thaela 4, 8Stwhe Adnennu,a 1l1- M16ee Jtiunlgy o 2f0 t1h0e.

Because WSTs can be freely composed, extending application to operate on a cascade of WSTs is fairly trivial. The only question is one of composition order: whether to initially compose the cascade into a single transducer (an approach we call offline composition) or to compose the initial embedding with the first transducer, trim useless states, compose the result with the second, and so on (an approach we call bucket brigade). The appropriate strategy generally depends on the structure of the individual transducers. A third approach builds the result incrementally, as dictated by some algorithm that requests information about it. Such an approach, which we call on-the-fly, was described in (Pereira and Riley, 1997; Mohri, 2009; Mohri et al., 2000). If we can efficiently calculate the outgoing edges of a state of the result WSA on demand, without calculating all edges in the entire machine, we can maintain a stand-in for the result structure, a machine consisting at first of only the start state of the true result. As a calling algorithm (e.g., an implementation of Dijkstra’s algorithm) requests information about the result graph, such as the set of outgoing edges from a state, we replace the current stand-in with a richer version by adding the result of the request. The on-the-fly approach has a distinct advantage over the other two methods in that the entire result graph need not be built. A graphical representation of all three methods is presented in Figure 1. 3 AppCliEcdcF//a..53ti64on of treeB tFranscd/d./3.u264cers Now let us revisit these strategies in the setting of trees and tree transducers. Imagine we have a tree or set of trees as input that can be represented as a weighted regular tree grammar3 (WRTG) and a WTT that can transform that input with some weight. We would like to know the k-best trees the WTT can produce as output for that input, along with their weights. We already know of several methods for acquiring k-best trees from a WRTG (Huang and Chiang, 2005; Pauls and Klein, 2009), so we then must ask if, analogously to the string case, WTTs preserve recognizability4 and we can form an application WRTG. Before we begin, however, we must define WTTs and WRTGs. 3.1 Preliminaries5 A ranked alphabet is a finite set Σ such that every member σ ∈ Σ has a rank rk(σ) ∈ N.

(Alexandrakis and Bozapalidis, 1987)) A weighted regular tree grammar (WRTG) is a 4-tuple G = (N, Σ, P, n0) where: 1. N is a finite set of nonterminals, with n0 ∈ N the start nonterminal. 2. Σ is a ranked alphabet of input symbols, where Σ ∩ N = ∅. 3. PΣ ∩is Na =tup ∅le.

A production p is a chain production if it is of the form ni nj, where ni, nj ∈ N.6 − →w 6In (Alexandrakis and Bozapalidis, 1987), chain productions are forbidden in order to avoid infinite summations. We explicitly allow such summations. A WRTG G is in normal form if each production is either a chain production or is of the form n σ(n1, . . . , nk) where σ ∈ Σ(k) and n1, . . . , nk →∈ σ N(n.

Def. 1of (Maletti, 2008)) A weighted extended top-down tree transducer (WXTT) is a 5-tuple M = (Q, Σ, ∆, R, q0) where: 1. Q is a finite set of states. 2. Σ and ∆ are the ranked alphabets of input and output symbols, respectively, where (Σ ∪ ∆) ∩ Q = 3.

Table 1 presents known results for the top-down tree transducer classes described in Section 3. 1. Unlike the string case, preservation of recognizability is not universal or symmetric. This is important for us, because we can only construct an application WRTG, i.e., a WRTG representing the result of application, if we can ensure that the language generated by application is in fact recognizable. Of the types under consideration, only wxLNT and wLNT preserve forward recognizability. The two classes marked as open questions and the other classes, which are superclasses of wNT, do not or are presumed not to. All subclasses of wxLT preserve backward recognizability.7 We do not consider cases where recognizability is not preserved tshuamt in the remainder of this paper. If a transducer M of a class that preserves forward recognizability is applied to a WRTG G, we can call the forward ap7Note that the introduction of weights limits recognizability preservation considerably. For example, (unweighted) xT preserves backward recognizability. plication WRTG M(G). and if M preserves backward recognizability, we can call the backward application WRTG M(G)/. Now that we have explained the application problem in the context of weighted tree transducers and determined the classes for which application is possible, let us consider how to build forward and backward application WRTGs. Our basic approach mimics that taken for WSTs by using an embed-compose-project strategy. As in string world, if we can embed the input in a transducer, compose with the given transducer, and project the result, we can obtain the application WRTG. Embedding a WRTG in a wLNT is a trivial operation—if the WRTG is in normal form and chain production-free,8 for every production of the form n − →w σ(n1 , . . . , nk), create a rule ofthe form n.σ(x1 , . . . , xk) − →w σ(n1 .x1, . . . , nk.xk). Range × projection of a w− x→LN σT(n is also trivial—for every q ∈ Q and u ∈ T∆ (Q X) create a production of the form q ∈−→w T u(0 where )u 0c is formed from u by replacing al−l → →lea uves of the form q.x with the leaf q, i.e., removing references to variables, and w is the sum of the weights of all rules of the form q.y → u in R.9 Domain projection for wxLT is bq.eyst →exp ulai inne dR b.y way of example. The left side of a rule is preserved, with variables leaves replaced by their associated states from the right side. So, the rule q1.σ(γ(x1) , x2) − →w δ(q2.x2, β(α, q3.x1)) would yield the production q1 q− →w σ(γ(q3) , q2) in the domain projection. Howev− →er, aσ dγe(lqeting rule such as q1.σ(x1 , x2) − →w γ(q2.x2) necessitates the introduction of a new →non γte(rqminal ⊥ that can genienrtartoed aullc toiof nT Σo fw ai nthe wwe niognhtte r1m . The only missing piece in our embed-composeproject strategy is composition. Algorithm 1, which is based on the declarative construction of Maletti (2006), generates the syntactic composition of a wxLT and a wLNT, a generalization of the basic composition construction of Baker (1979). It calls Algorithm 2, which determines the sequences of rules in the second transducer that match the right side of a single rule in the × first transducer. Since the embedded WRTG is of type wLNT, it may be either the first or second argument provided to Algorithm 1, depending on whether the application is forward or backward. We can thus use the embed-compose-project strategy for forward application of wLNT and backward application of wxLT and wxLNT. Note that we cannot use this strategy for forward applica8Without loss of generality we assume this is so, since standard algorithms exist to remove chain productions (Kuich, 1998; E´sik and Kuich, 2003; Mohri, 2009) and convert into normal form (Alexandrakis and Bozapalidis, 1987). 9Finitely many such productions may be formed. 1061 tion of wxLNT, even though that class preserves recognizability.

We will revisit the three strategies for accomplishing application discussed above for the string case. In order for offline composition to be a viable strategy, the transducers in the cascade must be closed under composition. Unfortunately, of the classes that preserve recognizability, only wLNT × is closed under composition (G´ ecseg and Steinby, 1984; Baker, 1979; Maletti et al., 2009; F ¨ul ¨op and Vogler, 2009). However, the general lack of composability of tree transducers does not preclude us from conducting forward application of a cascade. We revisit the bucket brigade approach, which in Section 2 appeared to be little more than a choice of composition order. As discussed previously, application of a single transducer involves an embedding, a composition, and a projection. The embedded WRTG is in the class wLNT, and the projection forms another WRTG. As long as every transducer in the cascade can be composed with a wLNT to its left or right, depending on the application type, application of a cascade is possible. Note that this embed-compose-project process is somewhat more burdensome than in the string case. For strings, application is obtained by a single embedding, a series of compositions, and a single projecAlgorithm 2 COVER 1: inputs 2: u ∈ T∆ (Q1 X) 3: wuT ∈ M T2 = (Q×2, X X∆), Γ, R2, q20 ) 4: state q2 ∈ Q2 ×× × 5: outputs 6: set of pairs (z, w) with z ∈ TΓ ((Q1 Q2) X) fsoetrm ofed p ab yir so (nze, ,o wr m) worieth hsu zcc ∈es Tsful runs× ×on Q Qu )b y × ×ru Xles) in R2, starting from q2, and w ∈ R+∞ the sum of the weights of all such runs,. 7: complexity 8: O(|R2|size(u)) 9: 10: 11: 12: 13: 14: if u(ε) is of the form (q1,x) ∈ Q1× X then zinit ← ((q1 q2), x) else zinit ← ⊥ Πlast ←← ←{(z ⊥init, {((ε, ε), q2)}, 1)} for all← v ∈ pos(u) εsu,εch), tqha)t} u(v) ∈ ∆(k) for some fko ≥r 0ll li nv p ∈ref ipxo osr(ude)r sduoc 15: ≥Π v0 i←n p ∅r 16: for ←all ∅(z, θ, w) ∈ Πlast do 17: rf aorll a(zll, vθ0, ∈w )lv ∈(z Π) such that z(v0) = ⊥ do 18: 19: 20: 21: 22: 23: 24: 25: 26: 27: 28: , dfoor all(θ(v,v0).u(v)(x1,...,xk) −w →0h)∈R2 θ0 ← θ For←m sθubstitution mapping ϕ : (Q2 X) → TΓ((Q1 Q2 X) {⊥}). f→or Ti = 1to× ×k dQo for all v00 ∈ pos(h) such that h(v00) = (q02 , xi∈) for some q20 ∈ Q2 do θ0(vi, v0v00) ← q20 if u(vi) ←is q of the form (q1, x) ∈ Q1 X then ∪ ,ϕ(x)q20 ∈, x Qi) ←× X((q t1h, eqn20), x) else ϕ(q20, xi) ← ⊥ Πv ← Πv {(z[ϕ)( ←h)] ⊥v0 , θ0, w · w0)} ∪ 29: Πlast ← Πv 30: Z ← {z |← ←(z Π, θ, Xw) 31: return {(z, X ∈ (z ,θ ,wX) X∈Πl Πlast} w) | z ∈ Z} ast X tion, whereas application for trees is obtained by a series of (embed, compose, project) operations. 4.1 On-the-fly algorithms We next consider on-the-fly algorithms for application. Similar to the string case, an on-thefly approach is driven by a calling algorithm that periodically needs to know the productions in a WRTG with a common left side nonterminal. The embed-compose-project approach produces an entire application WRTG before any inference algorithm is run. In order to admit an on-the-fly approach we describe algorithms that only generate those productions in a WRTG that have a given left nonterminal. In this section we extend Definition 3. 1 as follows: a WRTG is a 6tuple G = (N, P, n0,M,G) where N, P, and n0 are defined as in Definition 3. 1, and either M = G = ∅,10 or M is a wxLNT and G is a normMal = =fo Grm =, c ∅h,ain production-free WRTG such that Σ, 10In which case Σ, the definition is functionally unchanged from before. 1062 w t[xLypN] LeT (a)pPresOYNer Qovsateiodn?f(Grwe´ca(Fsd¨uMrg(lKeS¨coa punelgsid cowtihuSza,[rtxlbce1.2i]9,l0Nn2tybT091), 984w [txy](pbL Ne)T PrespvatiosYnNero svfebda?ckw(rFdu¨MlSeo¨c apesgl onwtiuza[r,xlcb.2]ei,NlL0t2yT 91)0 Table 1: Preservation of forward and backward recognizability for various classes of top-down tree transducers.

We have also designed an analogous onthe-fly PRODUCE algorithm for backward application on linear WTT. We have now defined several on-the-fly and bucket brigade algorithms, and also discussed the possibility of embed-compose-project and offline composition strategies to application of cascades of tree transducers. Tables 2a and 2b summarize the available methods of forward and backward application of cascades for recognizabilitypreserving tree transducer classes. 5 Decoding Experiments The main purpose of this paper has been to present novel algorithms for performing applica- tion. However, it is important to demonstrate these algorithms on real data. We thus demonstrate bucket-brigade and on-the-fly backward application on a typical NLP task cast as a cascade of wLNT.

The Japanese trees are unlabeled, meaning they have syntactic structure but all nodes are labeled “X”. We then cast this modified model as a cascade of LNT tree transducers.

The language model is cast as an identity WTT and thus fits naturally into the experimental framework. In our experiments we try several different language models to demonstrate varying performance of the application algorithms. The most realistic language model is a PCFG. Each rule captures the probability of a particular sequence of child labels given a parent label. This model has 7,765 rules. To demonstrate more extreme cases of the usefulness of the on-the-fly approach, we build a language model that recognizes exactly the 2,087 trees in the training corpus, each with equal weight. It has 39,455 rules. Finally, to be ultraspecific, we include a form of the “specific” language model just described, but only allow the English counterpart of the particular Japanese sentence being decoded in the language.

We evaluate the speed of each approach: bucket brigade and on-the-fly. The algorithm we use to obtain the 1-best path is a modification of the kbest algorithm of Pauls and Klein (2009). Our algorithm finds the 1-best path in a WRTG and admits an on-the-fly approach. The results of the experiments are shown in Table 3.

The results for the other two language models demonstrate more keenly the potential advantage that an on-the-fly approach provides—the simultaneous incorporation of information from all models allows application to be done more effectively than if each information source is considered in sequence. In the “exact” case, where a very large language model that simply recognizes each of the 2,087 trees in the training corpus is used, the final application is so large that it overwhelms the resources of a 4gb MacBook Pro, while the on-the-fly approach does not suffer from this problem. The “1-sent” case is presented to demonstrate the ripple effect caused by using on-the fly. In the other two cases, a very large language model generally overwhelms the timing statistics, regardless of the method being used. But a language model that represents exactly one sentence is very small, and thus the effects of simultaneous inference are readily apparent—the time to retrieve the 1-best sentence is reduced by two orders of magnitude in this experiment. 6 Conclusion We have presented algorithms for forward and backward application of weighted tree transducer cascades, including on-the-fly variants, and demonstrated the benefit of an on-the-fly approach to application. We note that a more formal approach to application of WTTs is being developed, 1065 independent from these efforts, by F ¨ul ¨op (2010). et al.

<p>Author: David Chiang</p><p>Abstract: Statistical translation models that try to capture the recursive structure of language have been widely adopted over the last few years. These models make use of varying amounts of information from linguistic theory: some use none at all, some use information about the grammar of the target language, some use information about the grammar of the source language. But progress has been slower on translation models that are able to learn the relationship between the grammars of both the source and target language. We discuss the reasons why this has been a challenge, review existing attempts to meet this challenge, and show how some old and new ideas can be combined into a sim- ple approach that uses both source and target syntax for significant improvements in translation accuracy.</p><p>6 0.14850737 <a title="21-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Blocked_Inference_in_Bayesian_Tree_Substitution_Grammars.html">53 acl-2010-Blocked Inference in Bayesian Tree Substitution Grammars</a></p>

<p>Author: Andreas Maletti</p><p>Abstract: A characterization of the expressive power of synchronous tree-adjoining grammars (STAGs) in terms of tree transducers (or equivalently, synchronous tree substitution grammars) is developed. Essentially, a STAG corresponds to an extended tree transducer that uses explicit substitution in both the input and output. This characterization allows the easy integration of STAG into toolkits for extended tree transducers. Moreover, the applicability of the characterization to several representational and algorithmic problems is demonstrated.</p><p>2 0.79812562 <a title="21-lsi-2" href="./acl-2010-Efficient_Inference_through_Cascades_of_Weighted_Tree_Transducers.html">95 acl-2010-Efficient Inference through Cascades of Weighted Tree Transducers</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan May ; Kevin Knight ; Heiko Vogler</p><p>Abstract: Weighted tree transducers have been proposed as useful formal models for representing syntactic natural language processing applications, but there has been little description of inference algorithms for these automata beyond formal foundations. We give a detailed description of algorithms for application of cascades of weighted tree transducers to weighted tree acceptors, connecting formal theory with actual practice. Additionally, we present novel on-the-fly variants of these algorithms, and compare their performance on a syntax machine translation cascade based on (Yamada and Knight, 2001). 1 Motivation Weighted finite-state transducers have found recent favor as models of natural language (Mohri, 1997). In order to make actual use of systems built with these formalisms we must first calculate the set of possible weighted outputs allowed by the transducer given some input, which we call forward application, or the set of possible weighted inputs given some output, which we call backward application. After application we can do some inference on this result, such as determining its k highest weighted elements. We may also want to divide up our problems into manageable chunks, each represented by a transducer. As noted by Woods (1980), it is easier for designers to write several small transducers where each performs a simple transformation, rather than painstakingly construct a single complicated device. We would like to know, then, the result of transformation of input or output by a cascade of transducers, one operating after the other. As we will see, there are various strategies for approaching this problem. We will consider offline composition, bucket brigade applica- tion, and on-the-fly application. Application of cascades of weighted string transducers (WSTs) has been well-studied (Mohri, Heiko Vogler Technische Universit a¨t Dresden Institut f u¨r Theoretische Informatik 01062 Dresden, Germany he iko .vogle r@ tu-dre s den .de 1997). Less well-studied but of more recent interest is application of cascades of weighted tree transducers (WTTs). We tackle application of WTT cascades in this work, presenting: • • • explicit algorithms for application of WTT casceaxpdelisc novel algorithms for on-the-fly application of nWoTvTe lca alscgoardieths,m mansd f experiments comparing the performance of tehxepseer iamlgeonrtisthm cos.m 2 Strategies for the string case Before we discuss application of WTTs, it is helpful to recall the solution to this problem in the WST domain. We recall previous formal presentations of WSTs (Mohri, 1997) and note informally that they may be represented as directed graphs with designated start and end states and edges labeled with input symbols, output symbols, and weights.1 Fortunately, the solution for WSTs is practically trivial—we achieve application through a series of embedding, composition, and projection operations. Embedding is simply the act of representing a string or regular string language as an identity WST. Composition of WSTs, that is, generating a single WST that captures the transformations of two input WSTs used in sequence, is not at all trivial, but has been well covered in, e.g., (Mohri, 2009), where directly implementable algorithms can be found. Finally, projection is another trivial operation—the domain or range language can be obtained from a WST by ignoring the output or input symbols, respectively, on its arcs, and summing weights on otherwise identical arcs. By embedding an input, composing the result with the given WST, and projecting the result, forward application is accomplished.2 We are then left with a weighted string acceptor (WSA), essentially a weighted, labeled graph, which can be traversed R+1∪W {e+ as∞su}m,te ha thtro thuegh woeuitgh t hi osf p aa ppaetrh t ihsa cta wlceuilgahtetds a asre th ien prod∪uct { +of∞ ∞th}e, wtheaitgh thtes wofe i gtsh etd ogfes a, panatdh t ihsat c athlceu lwateeigdh ats so tfh ae (not necessarily finite) set T of paths is calculated as the sum of the weights of the paths of T. 2For backward applications, the roles of input and output are simply exchanged. 1058 ProceedingUsp opfs thaela 4, 8Stwhe Adnennu,a 1l1- M16ee Jtiunlgy o 2f0 t1h0e.

Because WSTs can be freely composed, extending application to operate on a cascade of WSTs is fairly trivial. The only question is one of composition order: whether to initially compose the cascade into a single transducer (an approach we call offline composition) or to compose the initial embedding with the first transducer, trim useless states, compose the result with the second, and so on (an approach we call bucket brigade). The appropriate strategy generally depends on the structure of the individual transducers. A third approach builds the result incrementally, as dictated by some algorithm that requests information about it. Such an approach, which we call on-the-fly, was described in (Pereira and Riley, 1997; Mohri, 2009; Mohri et al., 2000). If we can efficiently calculate the outgoing edges of a state of the result WSA on demand, without calculating all edges in the entire machine, we can maintain a stand-in for the result structure, a machine consisting at first of only the start state of the true result. As a calling algorithm (e.g., an implementation of Dijkstra’s algorithm) requests information about the result graph, such as the set of outgoing edges from a state, we replace the current stand-in with a richer version by adding the result of the request. The on-the-fly approach has a distinct advantage over the other two methods in that the entire result graph need not be built. A graphical representation of all three methods is presented in Figure 1. 3 AppCliEcdcF//a..53ti64on of treeB tFranscd/d./3.u264cers Now let us revisit these strategies in the setting of trees and tree transducers. Imagine we have a tree or set of trees as input that can be represented as a weighted regular tree grammar3 (WRTG) and a WTT that can transform that input with some weight. We would like to know the k-best trees the WTT can produce as output for that input, along with their weights. We already know of several methods for acquiring k-best trees from a WRTG (Huang and Chiang, 2005; Pauls and Klein, 2009), so we then must ask if, analogously to the string case, WTTs preserve recognizability4 and we can form an application WRTG. Before we begin, however, we must define WTTs and WRTGs. 3.1 Preliminaries5 A ranked alphabet is a finite set Σ such that every member σ ∈ Σ has a rank rk(σ) ∈ N.

Table 1 presents known results for the top-down tree transducer classes described in Section 3. 1. Unlike the string case, preservation of recognizability is not universal or symmetric. This is important for us, because we can only construct an application WRTG, i.e., a WRTG representing the result of application, if we can ensure that the language generated by application is in fact recognizable. Of the types under consideration, only wxLNT and wLNT preserve forward recognizability. The two classes marked as open questions and the other classes, which are superclasses of wNT, do not or are presumed not to. All subclasses of wxLT preserve backward recognizability.7 We do not consider cases where recognizability is not preserved tshuamt in the remainder of this paper. If a transducer M of a class that preserves forward recognizability is applied to a WRTG G, we can call the forward ap7Note that the introduction of weights limits recognizability preservation considerably. For example, (unweighted) xT preserves backward recognizability. plication WRTG M(G). and if M preserves backward recognizability, we can call the backward application WRTG M(G)/. Now that we have explained the application problem in the context of weighted tree transducers and determined the classes for which application is possible, let us consider how to build forward and backward application WRTGs. Our basic approach mimics that taken for WSTs by using an embed-compose-project strategy. As in string world, if we can embed the input in a transducer, compose with the given transducer, and project the result, we can obtain the application WRTG. Embedding a WRTG in a wLNT is a trivial operation—if the WRTG is in normal form and chain production-free,8 for every production of the form n − →w σ(n1 , . . . , nk), create a rule ofthe form n.σ(x1 , . . . , xk) − →w σ(n1 .x1, . . . , nk.xk). Range × projection of a w− x→LN σT(n is also trivial—for every q ∈ Q and u ∈ T∆ (Q X) create a production of the form q ∈−→w T u(0 where )u 0c is formed from u by replacing al−l → →lea uves of the form q.x with the leaf q, i.e., removing references to variables, and w is the sum of the weights of all rules of the form q.y → u in R.9 Domain projection for wxLT is bq.eyst →exp ulai inne dR b.y way of example. The left side of a rule is preserved, with variables leaves replaced by their associated states from the right side. So, the rule q1.σ(γ(x1) , x2) − →w δ(q2.x2, β(α, q3.x1)) would yield the production q1 q− →w σ(γ(q3) , q2) in the domain projection. Howev− →er, aσ dγe(lqeting rule such as q1.σ(x1 , x2) − →w γ(q2.x2) necessitates the introduction of a new →non γte(rqminal ⊥ that can genienrtartoed aullc toiof nT Σo fw ai nthe wwe niognhtte r1m . The only missing piece in our embed-composeproject strategy is composition. Algorithm 1, which is based on the declarative construction of Maletti (2006), generates the syntactic composition of a wxLT and a wLNT, a generalization of the basic composition construction of Baker (1979). It calls Algorithm 2, which determines the sequences of rules in the second transducer that match the right side of a single rule in the × first transducer. Since the embedded WRTG is of type wLNT, it may be either the first or second argument provided to Algorithm 1, depending on whether the application is forward or backward. We can thus use the embed-compose-project strategy for forward application of wLNT and backward application of wxLT and wxLNT. Note that we cannot use this strategy for forward applica8Without loss of generality we assume this is so, since standard algorithms exist to remove chain productions (Kuich, 1998; E´sik and Kuich, 2003; Mohri, 2009) and convert into normal form (Alexandrakis and Bozapalidis, 1987). 9Finitely many such productions may be formed. 1061 tion of wxLNT, even though that class preserves recognizability.

We will revisit the three strategies for accomplishing application discussed above for the string case. In order for offline composition to be a viable strategy, the transducers in the cascade must be closed under composition. Unfortunately, of the classes that preserve recognizability, only wLNT × is closed under composition (G´ ecseg and Steinby, 1984; Baker, 1979; Maletti et al., 2009; F ¨ul ¨op and Vogler, 2009). However, the general lack of composability of tree transducers does not preclude us from conducting forward application of a cascade. We revisit the bucket brigade approach, which in Section 2 appeared to be little more than a choice of composition order. As discussed previously, application of a single transducer involves an embedding, a composition, and a projection. The embedded WRTG is in the class wLNT, and the projection forms another WRTG. As long as every transducer in the cascade can be composed with a wLNT to its left or right, depending on the application type, application of a cascade is possible. Note that this embed-compose-project process is somewhat more burdensome than in the string case. For strings, application is obtained by a single embedding, a series of compositions, and a single projecAlgorithm 2 COVER 1: inputs 2: u ∈ T∆ (Q1 X) 3: wuT ∈ M T2 = (Q×2, X X∆), Γ, R2, q20 ) 4: state q2 ∈ Q2 ×× × 5: outputs 6: set of pairs (z, w) with z ∈ TΓ ((Q1 Q2) X) fsoetrm ofed p ab yir so (nze, ,o wr m) worieth hsu zcc ∈es Tsful runs× ×on Q Qu )b y × ×ru Xles) in R2, starting from q2, and w ∈ R+∞ the sum of the weights of all such runs,. 7: complexity 8: O(|R2|size(u)) 9: 10: 11: 12: 13: 14: if u(ε) is of the form (q1,x) ∈ Q1× X then zinit ← ((q1 q2), x) else zinit ← ⊥ Πlast ←← ←{(z ⊥init, {((ε, ε), q2)}, 1)} for all← v ∈ pos(u) εsu,εch), tqha)t} u(v) ∈ ∆(k) for some fko ≥r 0ll li nv p ∈ref ipxo osr(ude)r sduoc 15: ≥Π v0 i←n p ∅r 16: for ←all ∅(z, θ, w) ∈ Πlast do 17: rf aorll a(zll, vθ0, ∈w )lv ∈(z Π) such that z(v0) = ⊥ do 18: 19: 20: 21: 22: 23: 24: 25: 26: 27: 28: , dfoor all(θ(v,v0).u(v)(x1,...,xk) −w →0h)∈R2 θ0 ← θ For←m sθubstitution mapping ϕ : (Q2 X) → TΓ((Q1 Q2 X) {⊥}). f→or Ti = 1to× ×k dQo for all v00 ∈ pos(h) such that h(v00) = (q02 , xi∈) for some q20 ∈ Q2 do θ0(vi, v0v00) ← q20 if u(vi) ←is q of the form (q1, x) ∈ Q1 X then ∪ ,ϕ(x)q20 ∈, x Qi) ←× X((q t1h, eqn20), x) else ϕ(q20, xi) ← ⊥ Πv ← Πv {(z[ϕ)( ←h)] ⊥v0 , θ0, w · w0)} ∪ 29: Πlast ← Πv 30: Z ← {z |← ←(z Π, θ, Xw) 31: return {(z, X ∈ (z ,θ ,wX) X∈Πl Πlast} w) | z ∈ Z} ast X tion, whereas application for trees is obtained by a series of (embed, compose, project) operations. 4.1 On-the-fly algorithms We next consider on-the-fly algorithms for application. Similar to the string case, an on-thefly approach is driven by a calling algorithm that periodically needs to know the productions in a WRTG with a common left side nonterminal. The embed-compose-project approach produces an entire application WRTG before any inference algorithm is run. In order to admit an on-the-fly approach we describe algorithms that only generate those productions in a WRTG that have a given left nonterminal. In this section we extend Definition 3. 1 as follows: a WRTG is a 6tuple G = (N, P, n0,M,G) where N, P, and n0 are defined as in Definition 3. 1, and either M = G = ∅,10 or M is a wxLNT and G is a normMal = =fo Grm =, c ∅h,ain production-free WRTG such that Σ, 10In which case Σ, the definition is functionally unchanged from before. 1062 w t[xLypN] LeT (a)pPresOYNer Qovsateiodn?f(Grwe´ca(Fsd¨uMrg(lKeS¨coa punelgsid cowtihuSza,[rtxlbce1.2i]9,l0Nn2tybT091), 984w [txy](pbL Ne)T PrespvatiosYnNero svfebda?ckw(rFdu¨MlSeo¨c apesgl onwtiuza[r,xlcb.2]ei,NlL0t2yT 91)0 Table 1: Preservation of forward and backward recognizability for various classes of top-down tree transducers.

We have also designed an analogous onthe-fly PRODUCE algorithm for backward application on linear WTT. We have now defined several on-the-fly and bucket brigade algorithms, and also discussed the possibility of embed-compose-project and offline composition strategies to application of cascades of tree transducers. Tables 2a and 2b summarize the available methods of forward and backward application of cascades for recognizabilitypreserving tree transducer classes. 5 Decoding Experiments The main purpose of this paper has been to present novel algorithms for performing applica- tion. However, it is important to demonstrate these algorithms on real data. We thus demonstrate bucket-brigade and on-the-fly backward application on a typical NLP task cast as a cascade of wLNT.

The Japanese trees are unlabeled, meaning they have syntactic structure but all nodes are labeled “X”. We then cast this modified model as a cascade of LNT tree transducers.

The language model is cast as an identity WTT and thus fits naturally into the experimental framework. In our experiments we try several different language models to demonstrate varying performance of the application algorithms. The most realistic language model is a PCFG. Each rule captures the probability of a particular sequence of child labels given a parent label. This model has 7,765 rules. To demonstrate more extreme cases of the usefulness of the on-the-fly approach, we build a language model that recognizes exactly the 2,087 trees in the training corpus, each with equal weight. It has 39,455 rules. Finally, to be ultraspecific, we include a form of the “specific” language model just described, but only allow the English counterpart of the particular Japanese sentence being decoded in the language.

We evaluate the speed of each approach: bucket brigade and on-the-fly. The algorithm we use to obtain the 1-best path is a modification of the kbest algorithm of Pauls and Klein (2009). Our algorithm finds the 1-best path in a WRTG and admits an on-the-fly approach. The results of the experiments are shown in Table 3.

The results for the other two language models demonstrate more keenly the potential advantage that an on-the-fly approach provides—the simultaneous incorporation of information from all models allows application to be done more effectively than if each information source is considered in sequence. In the “exact” case, where a very large language model that simply recognizes each of the 2,087 trees in the training corpus is used, the final application is so large that it overwhelms the resources of a 4gb MacBook Pro, while the on-the-fly approach does not suffer from this problem. The “1-sent” case is presented to demonstrate the ripple effect caused by using on-the fly. In the other two cases, a very large language model generally overwhelms the timing statistics, regardless of the method being used. But a language model that represents exactly one sentence is very small, and thus the effects of simultaneous inference are readily apparent—the time to retrieve the 1-best sentence is reduced by two orders of magnitude in this experiment. 6 Conclusion We have presented algorithms for forward and backward application of weighted tree transducer cascades, including on-the-fly variants, and demonstrated the benefit of an on-the-fly approach to application. We note that a more formal approach to application of WTTs is being developed, 1065 independent from these efforts, by F ¨ul ¨op (2010). et al.

<p>Author: Yoshihide Kato ; Shigeki Matsubara</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a method of correcting annotation errors in a treebank. By using a synchronous grammar, the method transforms parse trees containing annotation errors into the ones whose errors are corrected. The synchronous grammar is automatically induced from the treebank. We report an experimental result of applying our method to the Penn Treebank. The result demonstrates that our method corrects syntactic annotation errors with high precision.</p><p>4 0.67128694 <a title="21-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Bayesian_Synchronous_Tree-Substitution_Grammar_Induction_and_Its_Application_to_Sentence_Compression.html">46 acl-2010-Bayesian Synchronous Tree-Substitution Grammar Induction and Its Application to Sentence Compression</a></p>
<p>Author: Elif Yamangil ; Stuart M. Shieber</p><p>Abstract: We describe our experiments with training algorithms for tree-to-tree synchronous tree-substitution grammar (STSG) for monolingual translation tasks such as sentence compression and paraphrasing. These translation tasks are characterized by the relative ability to commit to parallel parse trees and availability of word alignments, yet the unavailability of large-scale data, calling for a Bayesian tree-to-tree formalism. We formalize nonparametric Bayesian STSG with epsilon alignment in full generality, and provide a Gibbs sampling algorithm for posterior inference tailored to the task of extractive sentence compression. We achieve improvements against a number of baselines, including expectation maximization and variational Bayes training, illustrating the merits of nonparametric inference over the space of grammars as opposed to sparse parametric inference with a fixed grammar.</p><p>5 0.59519494 <a title="21-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Blocked_Inference_in_Bayesian_Tree_Substitution_Grammars.html">53 acl-2010-Blocked Inference in Bayesian Tree Substitution Grammars</a></p>
<p>Author: Trevor Cohn ; Phil Blunsom</p><p>Abstract: Learning a tree substitution grammar is very challenging due to derivational ambiguity. Our recent approach used a Bayesian non-parametric model to induce good derivations from treebanked input (Cohn et al., 2009), biasing towards small grammars composed of small generalisable productions. In this paper we present a novel training method for the model using a blocked Metropolis-Hastings sampler in place of the previous method’s local Gibbs sampler. The blocked sampler makes considerably larger moves than the local sampler and consequently con- verges in less time. A core component of the algorithm is a grammar transformation which represents an infinite tree substitution grammar in a finite context free grammar. This enables efficient blocked inference for training and also improves the parsing algorithm. Both algorithms are shown to improve parsing accuracy.</p><p>6 0.58900088 <a title="21-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Learning_to_Translate_with_Source_and_Target_Syntax.html">169 acl-2010-Learning to Translate with Source and Target Syntax</a></p>

<p>Author: Andreas Maletti</p><p>Abstract: A characterization of the expressive power of synchronous tree-adjoining grammars (STAGs) in terms of tree transducers (or equivalently, synchronous tree substitution grammars) is developed. Essentially, a STAG corresponds to an extended tree transducer that uses explicit substitution in both the input and output. This characterization allows the easy integration of STAG into toolkits for extended tree transducers. Moreover, the applicability of the characterization to several representational and algorithmic problems is demonstrated.</p><p>2 0.74301809 <a title="21-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Computing_Weakest_Readings.html">67 acl-2010-Computing Weakest Readings</a></p>

A corpus-based evaluation with a large-scale grammar shows that our algorithm reduces over 80% of sentences to one or two readings, in negligible runtime, and thus makes it possible to work with semantic representations derived by deep large-scale grammars.</p><p>3 0.60241514 <a title="21-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Improving_the_Use_of_Pseudo-Words_for_Evaluating_Selectional_Preferences.html">148 acl-2010-Improving the Use of Pseudo-Words for Evaluating Selectional Preferences</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathanael Chambers ; Dan Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: This paper improves the use of pseudowords as an evaluation framework for selectional preferences. While pseudowords originally evaluated word sense disambiguation, they are now commonly used to evaluate selectional preferences. A selectional preference model ranks a set of possible arguments for a verb by their semantic fit to the verb. Pseudo-words serve as a proxy evaluation for these decisions. The evaluation takes an argument of a verb like drive (e.g. car), pairs it with an alternative word (e.g. car/rock), and asks a model to identify the original. This paper studies two main aspects of pseudoword creation that affect performance results. (1) Pseudo-word evaluations often evaluate only a subset of the words. We show that selectional preferences should instead be evaluated on the data in its entirety. (2) Different approaches to selecting partner words can produce overly optimistic evaluations. We offer suggestions to address these factors and present a simple baseline that outperforms the state-ofthe-art by 13% absolute on a newspaper domain.</p><p>4 0.5922718 <a title="21-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Learning_5000_Relational_Extractors.html">159 acl-2010-Learning 5000 Relational Extractors</a></p>
<p>Author: Raphael Hoffmann ; Congle Zhang ; Daniel S. Weld</p><p>Abstract: Many researchers are trying to use information extraction (IE) to create large-scale knowledge bases from natural language text on the Web. However, the primary approach (supervised learning of relation-specific extractors) requires manually-labeled training data for each relation and doesn’t scale to the thousands of relations encoded in Web text. This paper presents LUCHS, a self-supervised, relation-specific IE system which learns 5025 relations more than an order of magnitude greater than any previous approach with an average F1 score of 61%. Crucial to LUCHS’s performance is an automated system for dynamic lexicon learning, which allows it to learn accurately from heuristically-generated training data, which is often noisy and sparse. — —</p><p>5 0.59007537 <a title="21-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Accurate_Context-Free_Parsing_with_Combinatory_Categorial_Grammar.html">23 acl-2010-Accurate Context-Free Parsing with Combinatory Categorial Grammar</a></p>
<p>Author: Timothy A. D. Fowler ; Gerald Penn</p><p>Abstract: The definition of combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) in the literature varies quite a bit from author to author. However, the differences between the definitions are important in terms of the language classes of each CCG. We prove that a wide range of CCGs are strongly context-free, including the CCG of CCGbank and of the parser of Clark and Curran (2007). In light of these new results, we train the PCFG parser of Petrov and Klein (2007) on CCGbank and achieve state of the art results in supertagging accuracy, PARSEVAL measures and dependency accuracy.</p><p>6 0.58732843 <a title="21-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-The_Importance_of_Rule_Restrictions_in_CCG.html">228 acl-2010-The Importance of Rule Restrictions in CCG</a></p>

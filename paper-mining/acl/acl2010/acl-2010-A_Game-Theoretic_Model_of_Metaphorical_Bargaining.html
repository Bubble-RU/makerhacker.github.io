</p><p>11 The fact that European policy is being communicated and negotiated via a metaphor is not surprising; after all, “there is always someone willing to help us think by providing us with a metaphor that accords with HIS views. [sent-46, score-1.077]
</p><p>12 ”2 From the point of view of the dynamics of political discourse, the puzzle is rather the apparent tendency of politicians to be compelled by the rival’s metaphorical framework. [sent-47, score-0.366]
</p><p>13 Thatcher tries to turn the train metaphor used by the pro-EU camp around. [sent-48, score-0.588]
</p><p>14 Yet, assuming metaphors are matters of choice, why should Thatcher feel constrained by her rival’s choice, why doesn’t she ignore it and merely suggest a new metaphor of her own design? [sent-49, score-0.726]
</p><p>15 In this article, we use the explanatory frame-  work of game theory, seeking to rationalize the observed behavior by designing a game that would produce, at equilibrium, the observed dynamics. [sent-52, score-0.395]
</p><p>16 Specifically, we formalize the notion that the price of “locking” the public into a metaphorical frame ofreference is that a politician is coerced into staying within the metaphor as well, even if he or she is at the receiving end of a rival’s rhetorical move. [sent-53, score-1.032]
</p><p>17 Since the use of game theory is not common in computational linguistics, we first explain its main attributes, justify our decision to make use of it, and draw connections to research questions that can benefit from its application (section 2). [sent-54, score-0.174]
</p><p>18 Next, we design the game ofbargaining over a metaphor, and find its equilibrium (section 3), followed by a discussion (section 4). [sent-55, score-0.449]
</p><p>19 Different moves yield different utilities for a player; it is assumed that each player  would pick a strategy that maximizes her utility. [sent-57, score-0.339]
</p><p>20 The observable is the actual sequence of moves; importantly, these are assumed to be the optimal outcome (an equilibrium) of the relevant game. [sent-58, score-0.091]
</p><p>21 A popular notion of equilibrium is Nash equilibrium (Nash, 1950). [sent-59, score-0.55]
</p><p>22 For extensive form games (the type employed in this paper), the notion of subgame perfect equilibirum is typically used, denoting a Nash equilibrium that would remain such if the players start from any stage of the evolving game (Selten (1975; 1965)). [sent-60, score-0.738]

[sent-66, score-0.178]
</p><p>26 In recent applications in linguistics, pragmatic phenoma such as implicatures are rendered as an equilibrium outcome of a communication game (J¨ ager and Ebert, 2008; van Rooij, 2008; Ross, 2007; van Rooij and Schulz, 2004; Parikh, 2001 ; Glazer and Rubinstein, 2001 ; Dekker and van Rooy, 2000). [sent-67, score-0.605]
</p><p>27 For example, computing the equilibrium of a zero-sum game is equivalent to LP optimization (Luce and Raiffa, 1957); an equilibrium of general bimatrix games can be found using a pivoting algorithm (von Stengel, 2007; Lemke and Howson, 1964). [sent-69, score-0.724]

</p><p>33 The model consists of (1) two players representing the opposing sides, (2) a set of frames X⊂Rn compact and convex, (3) preference relXat⊂ioRns described by continuous utility functions U1, U2:X→R+, (4) a sequence of frames X0⊂X1 . [sent-84, score-0.339]

</p><p>49 2 Public utility We note the difference between two types of utilities: The utility of the players is over outcomes, the utility of the public is over sets of outcomes (frames). [sent-126, score-0.784]
</p><p>50 The latter does not represent a utility the public has for one outcome or another, but rather a utility it has for an enhanced understanding. [sent-127, score-0.642]
</p><p>51 Thus, the public’s utility from a frame is a function of the information content of the proposed frame relative to the current frame, i. [sent-128, score-0.515]

</p><p>54 Game dynamics  At every point in the game, a certain set of the states-of-affairs  is being deemed sufficiently pro-  bable by the public to require consideration. [sent-139, score-0.33]
</p><p>55 Sup-  pose that initially any state of affairs within the in-  terval [0, 1] is assigned a uniform probability and thus merits public attention. [sent-140, score-0.294]
</p><p>56 Each in her turn, the players propose to the public to concentrate on a subset of the currently considered states of affairs, arguing that those are the likelier ones to obtain, hence merit further attention. [sent-141, score-0.374]
</p><p>57 The metaphor used to deliver the proposal describes the newly *proposed subset in a way that makes those statesodfin-ga ffairs that are in it aligned with the metaphor, whereas all other states are left out of the proposed meeed taphorical frame. [sent-142, score-0.562]
</p><p>58 As the game proceeds, the ep uwbe’ll i gco attention is concentrated on successively esrms aller sets of eventualities, and these are given a more and more detailed metaphoric description, providing the educational gratification of increasingly knowing better and better what is going on.

</p><p>60 6 Figure 2 sketches the frame negotiation through train metaphor, from some point in time when the general train metaphor got established, through  Thatcher’s flashing out the issue of excessive speed and unclear direction, Major’s multi-track corrective, and reply of his opponents on the left. [sent-147, score-0.873]
</p><p>61 This is different from models of cheap talk such as Aumann (1990), Lewis (1969) where communication is devoid of strategic moves and is used primarily as a coordination device. [sent-149, score-0.242]
</p><p>62 4 The equilibrium A pair of strategies (σ1 , σ2) is a Nash equilibrium if there is no deviation strategy σ such that (σ, σ2) leads to an outcome with higher utility for player 1 than outcome of (σ1 , σ2) and the same for player 2. [sent-153, score-1.307]

</p><p>65 A pair of strategies is a subgame perfect equilibrium if, for any subgame, their substrategies are a Nash equilibrium. [sent-159, score-0.452]
</p><p>66 Theorem 1 In the frame bargaining game with single-peaked preferences 1. [sent-160, score-0.481]
</p><p>67 There exists a canonical subgame perfect equilibrium path F0, F1, F2, . [sent-161, score-0.452]
</p><p>68 For any subgame perfect equilibrium path F00, F10, F20, . [sent-166, score-0.452]
</p><p>69 The theorem states that the outcome of the bargaining will always be a frame on the canonical path. [sent-170, score-0.435]
</p><p>70 The rivals would suggest more specific frames either until convergence or until a situation where any further specification would produce a frame that “misses their point,” so-to-speak, by removing too much of the favorable outcome space for both players. [sent-171, score-0.313]
</p><p>71 The idea of the proof is to construct a pair of strategies where each side attempts to pull the publicly accepted frame in the direction of its peak utility point. [sent-176, score-0.418]
</p><p>72 We show, assuming the peak of the first mover is to the left of peak of the second, that any deviation of the first mover would enable the second to shift the public frame more to the right, to an outcome of lower utility to the first mover. [sent-177, score-0.86]
</p><p>73 Modeling the public preferences as highest relative entropy subset of possible states-of-affairs, we show that strategic choices by the politicians lead to a subgame perfect equilibrium where the less politically extreme player who moves first is at an advantage. [sent-183, score-1.161]
</p><p>74 In a democracy, such player would typically be the government, as the bulk of voters do not by definition vote for extreme views, and since the government is the agent that brings about changes in the current states of affairs, and is thus the first and most prepared to explain them to the public. [sent-184, score-0.282]
</p><p>75 Indeed, Entman’s model of frame activation in po-  litical discourse is hierarchical, with the govern702  ment (administration) being the topmost frameactivator, and opposition and media elites typically reacting to the administration’s frame (Entman, 2003). [sent-185, score-0.429]
</p><p>76 In political communication specifically, metaphor has long been known as a framing device. [sent-188, score-0.783]
</p><p>77 Metaphors are notorious for allowing subliminal framing, where  the metaphor seems so natural that the aspects of the phenomenon in question that do not align with the metaphor are seamlessly concealed. [sent-190, score-1.097]
</p><p>78 For example, WAR AS A COMPETITIVE GAME metaphor emphasizes the glory of winning and the shame of defeat, but hides the death-and-suffering aspect of the war, which makes sports metaphors a strategic choice when wishing to arouse a pro-war sentiment in the audience (Lakoff, 1991). [sent-191, score-0.82]
</p><p>79 Such subliminal framing can often be effectively contested by merely exposing the frame. [sent-192, score-0.116]
</p><p>80 Far from being subliminal or covert, the details of the metaphor, its implications, and the evaluation promoted by any given version are an important tool in the public discussion of a complex political issue. [sent-194, score-0.396]
</p><p>81 The measure of success for a  given version of the frame is its ability to sway the public in the evaluative direction envisioned by the author by providing sufficient educational benefit, so-to-speak, that is, convincingly rendering a good portion of a complex reality in accessible terms. [sent-196, score-0.438]
</p><p>82 Once a frame is found that provides extensive education benefit, such as the EUROPEAN INTEGRATION AS TRAIN JOURNEY above, a politician’s attempt to debunk a metaphor as inappropriate risk public antagonism, as this would be akin to taking the benefit of enhanced understanding away. [sent-197, score-0.961]
</p><p>83 Thus, rather than contesting the validity of the metaphoric frame, politicians strive to find a way to turn the metaphor around, i. [sent-198, score-0.657]
</p><p>84 Our results show that being the first to use an effective metaphor that manages to lock the public in its framework is a strategic advantage as the need to communicate with the same public would compel the rival to take up the metaphor of your choice. [sent-201, score-1.7]
</p><p>85 To our knowledge, this is the first explanation of the use of extended metaphor in po-  litical communication on a complex issue in terms of the agendas of the rival parties and the changing disposition of the public being addressed. [sent-202, score-1.075]
</p><p>86 It is an open question whether similar “locking in” of the public can be attained by non-metaphorical means, and whether the ensuing dynamics would be similar. [sent-203, score-0.357]
</p><p>87 3 Social dynamics This article contributes to the growing literature on modeling social linguistic behavior, like debates (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009), dating (Jurafsky et al. [sent-205, score-0.284]
</p><p>88 The latter literature in particular sees the social activity as an unfolding process, for example, detecting the onset and resolution of a controversy over the content of a Wikipedia article through tracking article talk7 and deletion-and-reversion patterns. [sent-211, score-0.277]

</p><p>92 5  Empirical challenges  We suggested that models of dynamics such as the one presented in this article be built over data where entities of interest are clearly identified. [sent-231, score-0.189]
</p><p>93 This article is based on chapters 1 and 2 of the book by Musolff (2000) which itself is informed by a corpus-linguistic analysis of metaphor in media discourse in Britain and Germany. [sent-232, score-0.641]
</p><p>94 The tasks that have been addressed are explication of the reasoning behind the metaphor (Barnden et al. [sent-236, score-0.525]
</p><p>95 , 2002; Narayanan, 1999; Hobbs, 1992); detection of conventional metaphors between two specific domains (Mason, 2004); classification of words, phrases or sentences as metaphoric or non-metaphoric (Krishnakumaran and Zhu, 2007; Birke and Sarkar, 2006;  Gedigian et al. [sent-237, score-0.239]
</p><p>96 Extended metaphors are expected to be difficult for such approaches, since many of the clauses are completely situated in the source domain and hence no local incongruities exist (see examples on the first page of this article). [sent-241, score-0.201]
</p><p>97 2  Data collection  Supervised approaches to metaphor detection need to rely on annotated data. [sent-243, score-0.525]
</p><p>98 Another approach is metaphor “harvesting” hypothesizing that metaphors ofinterest would occur in close proximity to lexical items representing the target domain of the metaphor, such as the 4 word window around the lemma Europe used in Reining and L ¨onneker-Rodman (2007). [sent-248, score-0.726]
</p><p>99 Given the central role played by the public gratification constraint in our model, would conversational situations without the need to persuade the public, such as meetings of small groups of peers or phone conversations between friends, tend less to the use of extended metaphor? [sent-261, score-0.301]
</p><p>100 Conversely, does the use of extended metaphor in other settings testify to the existence of presumed onlookers who need to be “captured” in a particular version of reality as in pedagogic or poetic context? [sent-262, score-0.555]

<p>Author: Beata Beigman Klebanov ; Eyal Beigman ; Daniel Diermeier</p><p>Abstract: We establish the following characteristics of the task of perspective classification: (a) using term frequencies in a document does not improve classification achieved with absence/presence features; (b) for datasets allowing the relevant comparisons, a small number of top features is found to be as effective as the full feature set and indispensable for the best achieved performance, testifying to the existence of perspective-specific keywords. We relate our findings to research on word frequency distributions and to discourse analytic studies of perspective.</p><p>4 0.066530928 <a title="6-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Non-Cooperation_in_Dialogue.html">178 acl-2010-Non-Cooperation in Dialogue</a></p>
<p>Author: Brian Pluss</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents ongoing research on computational models for non-cooperative dialogue. We start by analysing different levels of cooperation in conversation. Then, inspired by findings from an empirical study, we propose a technique for measuring non-cooperation in political interviews. Finally, we describe a research programme towards obtaining a suitable model and discuss previous accounts for conflictive dialogue, identifying the differences with our work.</p><p>5 0.064840838 <a title="6-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-A_Framework_for_Figurative_Language_Detection_Based_on_Sense_Differentiation.html">5 acl-2010-A Framework for Figurative Language Detection Based on Sense Differentiation</a></p>
<p>Author: Daria Bogdanova</p><p>Abstract: Various text mining algorithms require the process offeature selection. High-level semantically rich features, such as figurative language uses, speech errors etc., are very promising for such problems as e.g. writing style detection, but automatic extraction of such features is a big challenge. In this paper, we propose a framework for figurative language use detection. This framework is based on the idea of sense differentiation. We describe two algorithms illustrating the mentioned idea. We show then how these algorithms work by applying them to Russian language data.</p><p>6 0.059150267 <a title="6-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-WSD_as_a_Distributed_Constraint_Optimization_Problem.html">257 acl-2010-WSD as a Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem</a></p>

<p>Author: Morgan Sonderegger ; Partha Niyogi</p><p>Abstract: English noun/verb (N/V) pairs (contract, cement) have undergone complex patterns of change between 3 stress patterns for several centuries. We describe a longitudinal dataset of N/V pair pronunciations, leading to a set of properties to be accounted for by any computational model. We analyze the dynamics of 5 dynamical systems models of linguistic populations, each derived from a model of learning by individuals. We compare each model’s dynamics to a set of properties observed in the N/V data, and reason about how assumptions about individual learning affect population-level dynamics.</p><p>5 0.24035664 <a title="6-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Expanding_Verb_Coverage_in_Cyc_with_VerbNet.html">108 acl-2010-Expanding Verb Coverage in Cyc with VerbNet</a></p>
<p>Author: Clifton McFate</p><p>Abstract: A robust dictionary of semantic frames is an essential element of natural language understanding systems that use ontologies. However, creating lexical resources that accurately capture semantic representations en masse is a persistent problem. Where the sheer amount of content makes hand creation inefficient, computerized approaches often suffer from over generality and difficulty with sense disambiguation. This paper describes a semi-automatic method to create verb semantic frames in the Cyc ontology by converting the information contained in VerbNet into a Cyc usable format. This method captures the differences in meaning between types of verbs, and uses existing connections between WordNet, VerbNet, and Cyc to specify distinctions between individual verbs when available. This method provides 27,909 frames to OpenCyc which currently has none and can be used to extend ResearchCyc as well. We show that these frames lead to a 20% increase in sample sentences parsed over the Research Cyc verb lexicon. 1</p><p>6 0.21450047 <a title="6-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Correcting_Errors_in_Speech_Recognition_with_Articulatory_Dynamics.html">74 acl-2010-Correcting Errors in Speech Recognition with Articulatory Dynamics</a></p>

<p>Author: Min Zhang ; Hui Zhang ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a convolution forest kernel to effectively explore rich structured features embedded in a packed parse forest. As opposed to the convolution tree kernel, the proposed forest kernel does not have to commit to a single best parse tree, is thus able to explore very large object spaces and much more structured features embedded in a forest. This makes the proposed kernel more robust against parsing errors and data sparseness issues than the convolution tree kernel. The paper presents the formal definition of convolution forest kernel and also illustrates the computing algorithm to fast compute the proposed convolution forest kernel. Experimental results on two NLP applications, relation extraction and semantic role labeling, show that the proposed forest kernel significantly outperforms the baseline of the convolution tree kernel. 1</p><p>3 0.46468434 <a title="6-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Using_Anaphora_Resolution_to_Improve_Opinion_Target_Identification_in_Movie_Reviews.html">251 acl-2010-Using Anaphora Resolution to Improve Opinion Target Identification in Movie Reviews</a></p>

<p>Author: Yejin Choi ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: Automatic opinion recognition involves a number of related tasks, such as identifying the boundaries of opinion expression, determining their polarity, and determining their intensity. Although much progress has been made in this area, existing research typically treats each of the above tasks in isolation. In this paper, we apply a hierarchical parameter sharing technique using Conditional Random Fields for fine-grained opinion analysis, jointly detecting the boundaries of opinion expressions as well as determining two of their key attributes polarity and intensity. Our experimental results show that our proposed approach improves the performance over a baseline that does not — exploit hierarchical structure among the classes. In addition, we find that the joint approach outperforms a baseline that is based on cascading two separate components.</p><p>5 0.45989823 <a title="6-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Sentence_and_Expression_Level_Annotation_of_Opinions_in_User-Generated_Discourse.html">208 acl-2010-Sentence and Expression Level Annotation of Opinions in User-Generated Discourse</a></p>

We present a two-level annotation scheme. In the first stage, the reviews are analyzed at the sentence level for (i) relevancy to a given topic, and (ii) expressing an evaluation about the topic. In the second stage, on-topic sentences containing evaluations about the topic are further investigated at the expression level for pinpointing the properties (semantic orientation, intensity), and the functional components of the evaluations (opinion terms, targets and holders). We discuss the annotation scheme, the inter-annotator agreement for different subtasks and our observations.</p><p>6 0.45965296 <a title="6-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Entity-Based_Local_Coherence_Modelling_Using_Topological_Fields.html">101 acl-2010-Entity-Based Local Coherence Modelling Using Topological Fields</a></p>

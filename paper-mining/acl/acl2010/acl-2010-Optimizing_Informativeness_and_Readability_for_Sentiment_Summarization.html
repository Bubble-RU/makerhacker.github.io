<p>Author: Wei Wei ; Jon Atle Gulla</p><p>Abstract: Existing works on sentiment analysis on product reviews suffer from the following limitations: (1) The knowledge of hierarchical relationships of products attributes is not fully utilized. (2) Reviews or sentences mentioning several attributes associated with complicated sentiments are not dealt with very well. In this paper, we propose a novel HL-SOT approach to labeling a product’s attributes and their associated sentiments in product reviews by a Hierarchical Learning (HL) process with a defined Sentiment Ontology Tree (SOT). The empirical analysis against a humanlabeled data set demonstrates promising and reasonable performance of the proposed HL-SOT approach. While this paper is mainly on sentiment analysis on reviews of one product, our proposed HLSOT approach is easily generalized to labeling a mix of reviews of more than one products.</p><p>4 0.35090366 <a title="188-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Generating_Focused_Topic-Specific_Sentiment_Lexicons.html">123 acl-2010-Generating Focused Topic-Specific Sentiment Lexicons</a></p>
<p>Author: Valentin Jijkoun ; Maarten de Rijke ; Wouter Weerkamp</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for automatically generating focused and accurate topicspecific subjectivity lexicons from a general purpose polarity lexicon that allow users to pin-point subjective on-topic information in a set of relevant documents. We motivate the need for such lexicons in the field of media analysis, describe a bootstrapping method for generating a topic-specific lexicon from a general purpose polarity lexicon, and evaluate the quality of the generated lexicons both manually and using a TREC Blog track test set for opinionated blog post retrieval. Although the generated lexicons can be an order of magnitude more selective than the general purpose lexicon, they maintain, or even improve, the performance of an opin- ion retrieval system.</p><p>5 0.34279799 <a title="188-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Automatically_Generating_Annotator_Rationales_to_Improve_Sentiment_Classification.html">42 acl-2010-Automatically Generating Annotator Rationales to Improve Sentiment Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Ainur Yessenalina ; Yejin Choi ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: One ofthe central challenges in sentimentbased text categorization is that not every portion of a document is equally informative for inferring the overall sentiment of the document. Previous research has shown that enriching the sentiment labels with human annotators’ “rationales” can produce substantial improvements in categorization performance (Zaidan et al., 2007). We explore methods to automatically generate annotator rationales for document-level sentiment classification. Rather unexpectedly, we find the automatically generated rationales just as helpful as human rationales.</p><p>6 0.2305517 <a title="188-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-A_Study_of_Information_Retrieval_Weighting_Schemes_for_Sentiment_Analysis.html">18 acl-2010-A Study of Information Retrieval Weighting Schemes for Sentiment Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Georgios Paltoglou ; Mike Thelwall</p><p>Abstract: Most sentiment analysis approaches use as baseline a support vector machines (SVM) classifier with binary unigram weights. In this paper, we explore whether more sophisticated feature weighting schemes from Information Retrieval can enhance classification accuracy. We show that variants of the classic tf.idf scheme adapted to sentiment analysis provide significant increases in accuracy, especially when using a sublinear function for term frequency weights and document frequency smoothing. The techniques are tested on a wide selection of data sets and produce the best accuracy to our knowledge.</p><p>6 0.56896448 <a title="188-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Last_but_Definitely_Not_Least%3A_On_the_Role_of_the_Last_Sentence_in_Automatic_Polarity-Classification.html">157 acl-2010-Last but Definitely Not Least: On the Role of the Last Sentence in Automatic Polarity-Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Kornel Laskowski</p><p>Abstract: Substantial research effort has been invested in recent decades into the computational study and automatic processing of multi-party conversation. While most aspects of conversational speech have benefited from a wide availability of analytic, computationally tractable techniques, only qualitative assessments are available for characterizing multi-party turn-taking. The current paper attempts to address this deficiency by first proposing a framework for computing turn-taking model perplexity, and then by evaluating several multi-participant modeling approaches. Experiments show that direct multi-participant models do not generalize to held out data, and likely never will, for practical reasons. In contrast, the Extended-Degree-of-Overlap model represents a suitable candidate for future work in this area, and is shown to successfully predict the distribution of speech in time and across participants in previously unseen conversations.</p><p>2 0.75616533 <a title="188-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-A_Rational_Model_of_Eye_Movement_Control_in_Reading.html">13 acl-2010-A Rational Model of Eye Movement Control in Reading</a></p>
<p>Author: Klinton Bicknell ; Roger Levy</p><p>Abstract: A number of results in the study of realtime sentence comprehension have been explained by computational models as resulting from the rational use of probabilistic linguistic information. Many times, these hypotheses have been tested in reading by linking predictions about relative word difficulty to word-aggregated eye tracking measures such as go-past time. In this paper, we extend these results by asking to what extent reading is well-modeled as rational behavior at a finer level of analysis, predicting not aggregate measures, but the duration and location of each fixation. We present a new rational model of eye movement control in reading, the central assumption of which is that eye move- ment decisions are made to obtain noisy visual information as the reader performs Bayesian inference on the identities of the words in the sentence. As a case study, we present two simulations demonstrating that the model gives a rational explanation for between-word regressions.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.73517054 <a title="188-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Optimizing_Informativeness_and_Readability_for_Sentiment_Summarization.html">188 acl-2010-Optimizing Informativeness and Readability for Sentiment Summarization</a></p>

<p>Author: Cigdem Toprak ; Niklas Jakob ; Iryna Gurevych</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a corpus of consumer reviews from the rateitall and the eopinions websites annotated with opinion-related information. We present a two-level annotation scheme. In the first stage, the reviews are analyzed at the sentence level for (i) relevancy to a given topic, and (ii) expressing an evaluation about the topic. In the second stage, on-topic sentences containing evaluations about the topic are further investigated at the expression level for pinpointing the properties (semantic orientation, intensity), and the functional components of the evaluations (opinion terms, targets and holders). We discuss the annotation scheme, the inter-annotator agreement for different subtasks and our observations.</p><p>3 0.17996469 <a title="141-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Generating_Focused_Topic-Specific_Sentiment_Lexicons.html">123 acl-2010-Generating Focused Topic-Specific Sentiment Lexicons</a></p>
<p>Author: Valentin Jijkoun ; Maarten de Rijke ; Wouter Weerkamp</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for automatically generating focused and accurate topicspecific subjectivity lexicons from a general purpose polarity lexicon that allow users to pin-point subjective on-topic information in a set of relevant documents. We motivate the need for such lexicons in the field of media analysis, describe a bootstrapping method for generating a topic-specific lexicon from a general purpose polarity lexicon, and evaluate the quality of the generated lexicons both manually and using a TREC Blog track test set for opinionated blog post retrieval. Although the generated lexicons can be an order of magnitude more selective than the general purpose lexicon, they maintain, or even improve, the performance of an opin- ion retrieval system.</p><p>4 0.16989505 <a title="141-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Sentiment_Translation_through_Lexicon_Induction.html">210 acl-2010-Sentiment Translation through Lexicon Induction</a></p>

<p>Author: Wei Wei ; Jon Atle Gulla</p><p>Abstract: Existing works on sentiment analysis on product reviews suffer from the following limitations: (1) The knowledge of hierarchical relationships of products attributes is not fully utilized. (2) Reviews or sentences mentioning several attributes associated with complicated sentiments are not dealt with very well. In this paper, we propose a novel HL-SOT approach to labeling a product’s attributes and their associated sentiments in product reviews by a Hierarchical Learning (HL) process with a defined Sentiment Ontology Tree (SOT). The empirical analysis against a humanlabeled data set demonstrates promising and reasonable performance of the proposed HL-SOT approach. While this paper is mainly on sentiment analysis on reviews of one product, our proposed HLSOT approach is easily generalized to labeling a mix of reviews of more than one products.</p><p>6 0.14035214 <a title="141-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Hierarchical_Sequential_Learning_for_Extracting_Opinions_and_Their_Attributes.html">134 acl-2010-Hierarchical Sequential Learning for Extracting Opinions and Their Attributes</a></p>

<p>Author: Ainur Yessenalina ; Yejin Choi ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: One ofthe central challenges in sentimentbased text categorization is that not every portion of a document is equally informative for inferring the overall sentiment of the document. Previous research has shown that enriching the sentiment labels with human annotators’ “rationales” can produce substantial improvements in categorization performance (Zaidan et al., 2007). We explore methods to automatically generate annotator rationales for document-level sentiment classification. Rather unexpectedly, we find the automatically generated rationales just as helpful as human rationales.</p><p>4 0.59488857 <a title="141-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Experiments_in_Graph-Based_Semi-Supervised_Learning_Methods_for_Class-Instance_Acquisition.html">109 acl-2010-Experiments in Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning Methods for Class-Instance Acquisition</a></p>
<p>Author: Partha Pratim Talukdar ; Fernando Pereira</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms have been successfully used to extract class-instance pairs from large unstructured and structured text collections. However, a careful comparison of different graph-based SSL algorithms on that task has been lacking. We compare three graph-based SSL algorithms for class-instance acquisition on a variety of graphs constructed from different domains. We find that the recently proposed MAD algorithm is the most effective. We also show that class-instance extraction can be significantly improved by adding semantic information in the form of instance-attribute edges derived from an independently developed knowledge base. All of our code and data will be made publicly available to encourage reproducible research in this area.</p><p>5 0.59399635 <a title="141-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Sentiment_Translation_through_Lexicon_Induction.html">210 acl-2010-Sentiment Translation through Lexicon Induction</a></p>

<p>Author: Lei Cui ; Dongdong Zhang ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou ; Tiejun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: In hierarchical phrase-based SMT systems, statistical models are integrated to guide the hierarchical rule selection for better translation performance. Previous work mainly focused on the selection of either the source side of a hierarchical rule or the target side of a hierarchical rule rather than considering both of them simultaneously. This paper presents a joint model to predict the selection of hierarchical rules. The proposed model is estimated based on four sub-models where the rich context knowledge from both source and target sides is leveraged. Our method can be easily incorporated into the practical SMT systems with the log-linear model framework. The experimental results show that our method can yield significant improvements in performance.</p><p>3 0.76336962 <a title="141-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Learning_to_Adapt_to_Unknown_Users%3A_Referring_Expression_Generation_in_Spoken_Dialogue_Systems.html">167 acl-2010-Learning to Adapt to Unknown Users: Referring Expression Generation in Spoken Dialogue Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Srinivasan Janarthanam ; Oliver Lemon</p><p>Abstract: We present a data-driven approach to learn user-adaptive referring expression generation (REG) policies for spoken dialogue systems. Referring expressions can be difficult to understand in technical domains where users may not know the technical ‘jargon’ names of the domain entities. In such cases, dialogue systems must be able to model the user’s (lexical) domain knowledge and use appropriate referring expressions. We present a reinforcement learning (RL) framework in which the sys- tem learns REG policies which can adapt to unknown users online. Furthermore, unlike supervised learning methods which require a large corpus of expert adaptive behaviour to train on, we show that effective adaptive policies can be learned from a small dialogue corpus of non-adaptive human-machine interaction, by using a RL framework and a statistical user simulation. We show that in comparison to adaptive hand-coded baseline policies, the learned policy performs significantly better, with an 18.6% average increase in adaptation accuracy. The best learned policy also takes less dialogue time (average 1.07 min less) than the best hand-coded policy. This is because the learned policies can adapt online to changing evidence about the user’s domain expertise.</p><p>4 0.74092209 <a title="141-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Evaluating_Multilanguage-Comparability_of_Subjectivity_Analysis_Systems.html">105 acl-2010-Evaluating Multilanguage-Comparability of Subjectivity Analysis Systems</a></p>

Along with its applications to various NLP tasks, much work have put efforts into multilingual subjectivity learning from existing resources. Multilingual subjectivity analysis requires language-independent criteria for comparable outcomes across languages. This paper proposes to measure the multilanguage-comparability of subjectivity analysis tools, and provides meaningful comparisons of multilingual subjectivity analysis from various points of view.</p><p>5 0.72675663 <a title="141-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Sentiment_Translation_through_Lexicon_Induction.html">210 acl-2010-Sentiment Translation through Lexicon Induction</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian Scheible</p><p>Abstract: The translation of sentiment information is a task from which sentiment analysis systems can benefit. We present a novel, graph-based approach using SimRank, a well-established vertex similarity algorithm to transfer sentiment information between a source language and a target language graph. We evaluate this method in comparison with SO-PMI.</p><p>6 0.72529376 <a title="141-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Automatically_Generating_Annotator_Rationales_to_Improve_Sentiment_Classification.html">42 acl-2010-Automatically Generating Annotator Rationales to Improve Sentiment Classification</a></p>

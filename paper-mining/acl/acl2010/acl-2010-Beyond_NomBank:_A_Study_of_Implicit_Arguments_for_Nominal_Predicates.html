</p><p>5 1 Introduction Verbal and nominal semantic role labeling (SRL) have been studied independently of each other (Carreras and M `arquez, 2005; Gerber et al. [sent-10, score-0.271]

</p><p>9 From the sentences in Example 1, the reader can infer that The two companies refers to the agents (arg0) of the shipping predicate. [sent-21, score-0.151]
</p><p>10 1 These extra-sentential arguments have not been annotated for the shipping predicate and cannot be identified by a system that restricts the argument search space to the sentence containing the predicate. [sent-23, score-1.032]
</p><p>11 These examples demonstrate the presence of arguments that are not included in NomBank and cannot easily be identified by systems trained on the resource. [sent-26, score-0.31]
</p><p>12 This paper presents our study of implicit arguments for nominal predicates. [sent-28, score-0.948]
</p><p>13 We began our  study by annotating implicit arguments for a select group of predicates. [sent-29, score-0.765]
</p><p>14 For these predicates, we found that implicit arguments add 65% to the existing role coverage of NomBank. [sent-30, score-0.864]
</p><p>15 Using our annotations, we constructed a feature-based model for automatic implicit argument identification that unifies standard verbal and nominal SRL. [sent-34, score-1.075]
</p><p>16 We present our annotation effort  in Section 3, and follow with our implicit argument identification model in Section 4. [sent-44, score-0.774]
</p><p>17 Their approach used a fine-grained domain model to assess the compatibility of candidate arguments and the slots needing to be filled. [sent-49, score-0.352]
</p><p>18 A phenomenon similar to the implicit argument has been studied in the context of Japanese anaphora resolution, where a missing case-marked constituent is viewed as a zero-anaphoric expression whose antecedent is treated as the implicit argument of the predicate of interest. [sent-50, score-1.915]
</p><p>19 (2007), and researchers have applied standard SRL techniques to this corpus, resulting in systems that are able to identify missing case-marked expressions in the surrounding discourse (Imamura et  al. [sent-52, score-0.266]
</p><p>20 The authors used automatically derived nominal case frames to identify antecedents. [sent-56, score-0.208]
</p><p>21 Fillmore and Baker (2001) provided a detailed case study of implicit arguments (termed null instantiations in that work), but did not provide concrete methods to account for them automatically. [sent-59, score-0.765]
</p><p>22 Previously, we demonstrated the importance of filtering out nominal predicates that take no local arguments (Gerber et al. [sent-60, score-0.668]
</p><p>23 , 2009); however, this work did not address the identification of implicit arguments. [sent-61, score-0.478]
</p><p>24 (2005) suggested approaches to implicit argument identification based on observed coreference patterns; however, the authors did not implement and evaluate such methods. [sent-63, score-0.852]
</p><p>25 We show that the identification of implicit arguments for nominal predicates leads to fuller semantic interpretations when compared to  traditional SRL methods. [sent-65, score-1.172]
</p><p>26 , our model uses a quantitative analysis of naturally occurring coreference patterns to aid implicit argument identification. [sent-67, score-0.797]
</p><p>27 (2009) conducted SemEval Task 10, “Linking Events and Their Participants in Discourse”, which evaluated implicit argument identification systems over a common test set. [sent-69, score-0.802]
</p><p>28 The task organizers annotated implicit arguments across entire passages, resulting in data that cover many distinct predicates, each associated with a small number of annotated instances. [sent-70, score-0.868]
</p><p>29 In contrast, our study focused on a select group of nominal predicates, each associated with a large number of annotated instances. [sent-71, score-0.297]
</p><p>30 1 Data annotation Implicit arguments have not been annotated within the Penn TreeBank, which is the textual and syntactic basis for NomBank. [sent-73, score-0.398]
</p><p>31 Thus, to facilitate our study, we annotated implicit arguments for instances of nominal predicates within the stan-  dard training, development, and testing sections of the TreeBank. [sent-74, score-1.224]
</p><p>32 We limited our attention to nominal predicates with unambiguous role sets (i. [sent-75, score-0.42]
</p><p>33 We then ranked this set of predicates using two pieces of information: (1) the average difference between the number of roles expressed in nominal form (in NomBank) versus verbal form (in PropBank) and (2) the frequency of the nominal form in the corpus. [sent-78, score-0.735]
</p><p>34 We assumed that the former gives an indication as to how many implicit roles an instance of the nominal predicate might have. [sent-79, score-0.986]
</p><p>35 The product of (1) and (2) thus indicates the potential prevalence of implicit arguments for a predicate. [sent-80, score-0.733]
</p><p>36 To focus our study, we ranked the predicates in NomBank according to this product and selected the top ten, shown in Table 1. [sent-81, score-0.175]
</p><p>37 We annotated implicit arguments document-bydocument, selecting all singular and plural nouns derived from the predicates in Table 1. [sent-82, score-0.961]
</p><p>38 For each missing argument position of each predicate instance, we inspected the local discourse for a suitable implicit argument. [sent-83, score-1.233]
</p><p>39 We limited our attention to  the current sentence as well as all preceding sentences in the document, annotating all mentions of an implicit argument within this window. [sent-84, score-0.819]
</p><p>40 In the remainder ofthis paper, we will use iargn to refer to an implicit argument position n. [sent-85, score-0.988]
</p><p>41 We will use argn to refer to an argument provided by PropBank or NomBank. [sent-86, score-0.371]
</p><p>42 The second column gives the number of predicate instances annotated. [sent-88, score-0.341]
</p><p>43 Pre-annotation numbers only include NomBank annotations, whereas Post-annotation numbers include NomBank and implicit argument annotations. [sent-89, score-0.719]
</p><p>44 Role average indicates how many roles, on average, are filled for an instance of a predicate’s noun form or verb form within the TreeBank. [sent-91, score-0.17]
</p><p>45 Below, we give an example annotation for an instance of the investment predicate: (2)  [iarg0 Participants] will be able to transfer [iarg1 money] to [iarg2 other investment  funds]. [sent-94, score-0.316]
</p><p>46 NomBank does not associate this instance of investment with any arguments; however, we were able to identify the investor (iarg0), the thing invested (iarg1), and two mentions of the thing invested in (iarg2). [sent-96, score-0.583]
</p><p>47 For each missing argument position, the student was asked to identify the closest acceptable implicit argument within the current and preceding sentences. [sent-98, score-1.243]
</p><p>48 The argument position was left unfilled if no acceptable constituent could be found. [sent-99, score-0.488]
</p><p>49 For a missing argument position, the student’s annotation agreed with our own if both identified the same constituent or both left the position unfilled. [sent-100, score-0.606]
</p><p>50 2 Annotation analysis Role coverage for a predicate instance is equal to  the number of filled roles divided by the number of roles in the predicate’s lexicon entry. [sent-103, score-0.617]
</p><p>51 Role coverage for the marked predicate in Example 2 is 0/3 for NomBank-only arguments and 3/3 when the annotated implicit arguments are also considered. [sent-104, score-1.401]
</p><p>52 Returning to Table 1, the third column gives role coverage percentages for NomBank-only arguments. [sent-105, score-0.224]
</p><p>53 The sixth column gives role coverage percentages when both NomBank arguments and the annotated implicit arguments are considered. [sent-106, score-1.32]
</p><p>54 Overall, the addition of implicit arguments created a 65% relative (18-point absolute) gain in role coverage across the 1,253 predicate instances that we annotated. [sent-107, score-1.145]
</p><p>55 The predicates in Table 1 are typically associated with fewer arguments on average than their corresponding verbal predicates. [sent-108, score-0.632]
</p><p>56 When implicit arguments are included in the comparison, these differences are reduced and many nominal predicates express approximately the same num-  ber of arguments on average as their verbal counterparts (compare the fifth and seventh columns). [sent-110, score-1.519]
</p><p>57 In addition to role coverage and average count, we examined the location of implicit arguments. [sent-111, score-0.554]
</p><p>58 Figure 1shows that approximately 56% of the implicit arguments in our data can be resolved within the sentence containing the predicate. [sent-112, score-0.792]
</p><p>59 The remaining implicit arguments require up to forty-six sen1585  missing argument positions with an implicit filler,  the y-axis indicates the likelihood of the filler being found at least once in the previous x sentences. [sent-113, score-1.768]
</p><p>60 NomBank includes a lexicon listing the possible argument positions for a predicate, allowing us to identify missing argument positions with a simple lookup. [sent-118, score-0.902]
</p><p>61 Given a nominal predicate instance p with a missing argument position iargn, the task is to search the surrounding discourse for a constituent c that fills iargn. [sent-119, score-1.234]
</p><p>62 A candidate constituent c will often form a  coreference chain with other constituents in the discourse. [sent-121, score-0.274]
</p><p>63 (4) Conservative Japanese investors are put off by [Mexico’s] investment regulations. [sent-123, score-0.136]
</p><p>64 NomBank does not associate the labeled instance of investment with any arguments, but it is clear from the surrounding discourse that constituent c (referring to Mexico) is the thing being invested in (the iarg2). [sent-125, score-0.52]
</p><p>65 When determining whether c is the iarg2 of investment, one can draw evidence from other mentions in c’s coreference chain. [sent-126, score-0.143]
</p><p>66 These propositions, which can be derived via traditional SRL analyses, should increase our confidence that c is the iarg2 of investment in Example 5. [sent-129, score-0.136]
</p><p>67 Thus, the unit of classification for a candidate constituent c is the three-tuple hp, iargn, c0i, dwahteere co cn0 itist a ncotr cef iesre thnece t crheeai-ntu comprising c anid, its coreferent constituents. [sent-130, score-0.215]

</p><p>91 We scored predictions using the Dice coefficient, which is defined as follows:  2| P∗r |Pedriecdtiecdt|ed +T |TTrurue|e|  (11)  Predicted is the set of tokens subsumed by the constituent predicted by the model as filling a missing argument position. [sent-214, score-0.588]

<p>Author: Junhui Li ; Guodong Zhou ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: This paper explores joint syntactic and semantic parsing of Chinese to further improve the performance of both syntactic and semantic parsing, in particular the performance of semantic parsing (in this paper, semantic role labeling). This is done from two levels. Firstly, an integrated parsing approach is proposed to integrate semantic parsing into the syntactic parsing process. Secondly, semantic information generated by semantic parsing is incorporated into the syntactic parsing model to better capture semantic information in syntactic parsing. Evaluation on Chinese TreeBank, Chinese PropBank, and Chinese NomBank shows that our integrated parsing approach outperforms the pipeline parsing approach on n-best parse trees, a natural extension of the widely used pipeline parsing approach on the top-best parse tree. Moreover, it shows that incorporating semantic role-related information into the syntactic parsing model significantly improves the performance of both syntactic parsing and semantic parsing. To our best knowledge, this is the first research on exploring syntactic parsing and semantic role labeling for both verbal and nominal predicates in an integrated way. 1</p><p>3 0.27008668 <a title="49-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-A_Structured_Model_for_Joint_Learning_of_Argument_Roles_and_Predicate_Senses.html">17 acl-2010-A Structured Model for Joint Learning of Argument Roles and Predicate Senses</a></p>
<p>Author: Yotaro Watanabe ; Masayuki Asahara ; Yuji Matsumoto</p><p>Abstract: In predicate-argument structure analysis, it is important to capture non-local dependencies among arguments and interdependencies between the sense of a predicate and the semantic roles of its arguments. However, no existing approach explicitly handles both non-local dependencies and semantic dependencies between predicates and arguments. In this paper we propose a structured model that overcomes the limitation of existing approaches; the model captures both types of dependencies simultaneously by introducing four types of factors including a global factor type capturing non-local dependencies among arguments and a pairwise factor type capturing local dependencies between a predicate and an argument. In experiments the proposed model achieved competitive results compared to the stateof-the-art systems without applying any feature selection procedure.</p><p>4 0.26843637 <a title="49-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Fully_Unsupervised_Core-Adjunct_Argument_Classification.html">120 acl-2010-Fully Unsupervised Core-Adjunct Argument Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Hirotoshi Taira ; Sanae Fujita ; Masaaki Nagata</p><p>Abstract: Maintaining high annotation consistency in large corpora is crucial for statistical learning; however, such work is hard, especially for tasks containing semantic elements. This paper describes predicate argument structure analysis using transformation-based learning. An advantage of transformation-based learning is the readability of learned rules. A disadvantage is that the rule extraction procedure is time-consuming. We present incremental-based, transformation-based learning for semantic processing tasks. As an example, we deal with Japanese predicate argument analysis and show some tendencies of annotators for constructing a corpus with our method.</p><p>6 0.2498707 <a title="49-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Open-Domain_Semantic_Role_Labeling_by_Modeling_Word_Spans.html">184 acl-2010-Open-Domain Semantic Role Labeling by Modeling Word Spans</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthew Gerber ; Joyce Chai</p><p>Abstract: Despite its substantial coverage, NomBank does not account for all withinsentence arguments and ignores extrasentential arguments altogether. These arguments, which we call implicit, are important to semantic processing, and their recovery could potentially benefit many NLP applications. We present a study of implicit arguments for a select group of frequent nominal predicates. We show that implicit arguments are pervasive for these predicates, adding 65% to the coverage of NomBank. We demonstrate the feasibility of recovering implicit arguments with a supervised classification model.

<p>Author: Yotaro Watanabe ; Masayuki Asahara ; Yuji Matsumoto</p><p>Abstract: In predicate-argument structure analysis, it is important to capture non-local dependencies among arguments and interdependencies between the sense of a predicate and the semantic roles of its arguments. However, no existing approach explicitly handles both non-local dependencies and semantic dependencies between predicates and arguments. In this paper we propose a structured model that overcomes the limitation of existing approaches; the model captures both types of dependencies simultaneously by introducing four types of factors including a global factor type capturing non-local dependencies among arguments and a pairwise factor type capturing local dependencies between a predicate and an argument. In experiments the proposed model achieved competitive results compared to the stateof-the-art systems without applying any feature selection procedure.</p><p>3 0.77487779 <a title="49-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-Predicate_Argument_Structure_Analysis_Using_Transformation_Based_Learning.html">198 acl-2010-Predicate Argument Structure Analysis Using Transformation Based Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Omri Abend ; Ari Rappoport</p><p>Abstract: The core-adjunct argument distinction is a basic one in the theory of argument structure. The task of distinguishing between the two has strong relations to various basic NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing, semantic role labeling and subcategorization acquisition. This paper presents a novel unsupervised algorithm for the task that uses no supervised models, utilizing instead state-of-the-art syntactic induction algorithms. This is the first work to tackle this task in a fully unsupervised scenario.</p><p>5 0.71880996 <a title="49-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Edit_Tree_Distance_Alignments_for_Semantic_Role_Labelling.html">94 acl-2010-Edit Tree Distance Alignments for Semantic Role Labelling</a></p>

The novelty of the system lies in comparing the sentences as tree structures with multiple relations instead of extracting vectors of features for each relation and classifying them. The system was tested with the English CoNLL-2009 shared task data set where 79% accuracy was obtained. 1</p><p>6 0.68659854 <a title="49-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Starting_from_Scratch_in_Semantic_Role_Labeling.html">216 acl-2010-Starting from Scratch in Semantic Role Labeling</a></p>

<p>Author: Minwoo Jeong ; Ivan Titov</p><p>Abstract: Documents often have inherently parallel structure: they may consist of a text and commentaries, or an abstract and a body, or parts presenting alternative views on the same problem. Revealing relations between the parts by jointly segmenting and predicting links between the segments, would help to visualize such documents and construct friendlier user interfaces. To address this problem, we propose an unsupervised Bayesian model for joint discourse segmentation and alignment. We apply our method to the “English as a second language” podcast dataset where each episode is composed of two parallel parts: a story and an explanatory lecture. The predicted topical links uncover hidden re- lations between the stories and the lectures. In this domain, our method achieves competitive results, rivaling those of a previously proposed supervised technique.</p><p>4 0.60928679 <a title="49-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-A_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation_Method_for_Selectional_Preferences.html">10 acl-2010-A Latent Dirichlet Allocation Method for Selectional Preferences</a></p>
<p>Author: Alan Ritter ; Mausam Mausam ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: The computation of selectional preferences, the admissible argument values for a relation, is a well-known NLP task with broad applicability. We present LDA-SP, which utilizes LinkLDA (Erosheva et al., 2004) to model selectional preferences. By simultaneously inferring latent topics and topic distributions over relations, LDA-SP combines the benefits of previous approaches: like traditional classbased approaches, it produces humaninterpretable classes describing each relation’s preferences, but it is competitive with non-class-based methods in predictive power. We compare LDA-SP to several state-ofthe-art methods achieving an 85% increase in recall at 0.9 precision over mutual information (Erk, 2007). We also evaluate LDA-SP’s effectiveness at filtering improper applications of inference rules, where we show substantial improvement over Pantel et al. ’s system (Pantel et al., 2007).</p><p>5 0.6058988 <a title="49-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Contextualizing_Semantic_Representations_Using_Syntactically_Enriched_Vector_Models.html">70 acl-2010-Contextualizing Semantic Representations Using Syntactically Enriched Vector Models</a></p>

It employs a systematic combination of first- and second-order context vectors. We apply our model to two different tasks and show that (i) it substantially outperforms previous work on a paraphrase ranking task, and (ii) achieves promising results on a wordsense similarity task; to our knowledge, it is the first time that an unsupervised method has been applied to this task.</p><p>6 0.6049701 <a title="49-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Learning_Lexicalized_Reordering_Models_from_Reordering_Graphs.html">163 acl-2010-Learning Lexicalized Reordering Models from Reordering Graphs</a></p>

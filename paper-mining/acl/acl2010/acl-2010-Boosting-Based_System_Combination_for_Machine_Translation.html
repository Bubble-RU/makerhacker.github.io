<p>Author: Radu Soricut ; Abdessamad Echihabi</p><p>Abstract: The adoption ofMachine Translation technology for commercial applications is hampered by the lack of trust associated with machine-translated output. In this paper, we describe TrustRank, an MT system enhanced with a capability to rank the quality of translation outputs from good to bad. This enables the user to set a quality threshold, granting the user control over the quality of the translations. We quantify the gains we obtain in translation quality, and show that our solution works on a wide variety of domains and language pairs.</p><p>3 0.2325644 <a title="54-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Improving_Arabic-to-English_Statistical_Machine_Translation_by_Reordering_Post-Verbal_Subjects_for_Alignment.html">145 acl-2010-Improving Arabic-to-English Statistical Machine Translation by Reordering Post-Verbal Subjects for Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Marine Carpuat ; Yuval Marton ; Nizar Habash</p><p>Abstract: We study the challenges raised by Arabic verb and subject detection and reordering in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). We show that post-verbal subject (VS) constructions are hard to translate because they have highly ambiguous reordering patterns when translated to English. In addition, implementing reordering is difficult because the boundaries of VS constructions are hard to detect accurately, even with a state-of-the-art Arabic dependency parser. We therefore propose to reorder VS constructions into SV order for SMT word alignment only. This strategy significantly improves BLEU and TER scores, even on a strong large-scale baseline and despite noisy parses.</p><p>4 0.22540347 <a title="54-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Training_Phrase_Translation_Models_with_Leaving-One-Out.html">240 acl-2010-Training Phrase Translation Models with Leaving-One-Out</a></p>
<p>Author: Joern Wuebker ; Arne Mauser ; Hermann Ney</p><p>Abstract: Several attempts have been made to learn phrase translation probabilities for phrasebased statistical machine translation that go beyond pure counting of phrases in word-aligned training data. Most approaches report problems with overfitting. We describe a novel leavingone-out approach to prevent over-fitting that allows us to train phrase models that show improved translation performance on the WMT08 Europarl German-English task. In contrast to most previous work where phrase models were trained separately from other models used in translation, we include all components such as single word lexica and reordering mod- els in training. Using this consistent training of phrase models we are able to achieve improvements of up to 1.4 points in BLEU. As a side effect, the phrase table size is reduced by more than 80%.</p><p>5 0.2210777 <a title="54-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Error_Detection_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation_Using_Linguistic_Features.html">102 acl-2010-Error Detection for Statistical Machine Translation Using Linguistic Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Deyi Xiong ; Min Zhang ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: Automatic error detection is desired in the post-processing to improve machine translation quality. The previous work is largely based on confidence estimation using system-based features, such as word posterior probabilities calculated from Nbest lists or word lattices. We propose to incorporate two groups of linguistic features, which convey information from outside machine translation systems, into error detection: lexical and syntactic features. We use a maximum entropy classifier to predict translation errors by integrating word posterior probability feature and linguistic features. The experimental results show that 1) linguistic features alone outperform word posterior probability based confidence estimation in error detection; and 2) linguistic features can further provide complementary information when combined with word confidence scores, which collectively reduce the classification error rate by 18.52% and improve the F measure by 16.37%.</p><p>6 0.21740764 <a title="54-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Unsupervised_Search_for_the_Optimal_Segmentation_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">249 acl-2010-Unsupervised Search for the Optimal Segmentation for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Yifan He ; Yanjun Ma ; Josef van Genabith ; Andy Way</p><p>Abstract: We propose a translation recommendation framework to integrate Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) output with Translation Memory (TM) systems. The framework recommends SMT outputs to a TM user when it predicts that SMT outputs are more suitable for post-editing than the hits provided by the TM. We describe an implementation of this framework using an SVM binary classifier. We exploit methods to fine-tune the classifier and investigate a variety of features of different types. We rely on automatic MT evaluation metrics to approximate human judgements in our experiments. Experimental results show that our system can achieve 0.85 precision at 0.89 recall, excluding ex- act matches. Furthermore, it is possible for the end-user to achieve a desired balance between precision and recall by adjusting confidence levels.</p><p>6 0.73710215 <a title="54-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Error_Detection_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation_Using_Linguistic_Features.html">102 acl-2010-Error Detection for Statistical Machine Translation Using Linguistic Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Elif Yamangil ; Stuart M. Shieber</p><p>Abstract: We describe our experiments with training algorithms for tree-to-tree synchronous tree-substitution grammar (STSG) for monolingual translation tasks such as sentence compression and paraphrasing. These translation tasks are characterized by the relative ability to commit to parallel parse trees and availability of word alignments, yet the unavailability of large-scale data, calling for a Bayesian tree-to-tree formalism. We formalize nonparametric Bayesian STSG with epsilon alignment in full generality, and provide a Gibbs sampling algorithm for posterior inference tailored to the task of extractive sentence compression. We achieve improvements against a number of baselines, including expectation maximization and variational Bayes training, illustrating the merits of nonparametric inference over the space of grammars as opposed to sparse parametric inference with a fixed grammar.</p><p>3 0.64592022 <a title="54-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Open_Information_Extraction_Using_Wikipedia.html">185 acl-2010-Open Information Extraction Using Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>Author: Fei Wu ; Daniel S. Weld</p><p>Abstract: Information-extraction (IE) systems seek to distill semantic relations from naturallanguage text, but most systems use supervised learning of relation-specific examples and are thus limited by the availability of training data. Open IE systems such as TextRunner, on the other hand, aim to handle the unbounded number of relations found on the Web. But how well can these open systems perform? This paper presents WOE, an open IE system which improves dramatically on TextRunner’s precision and recall. The key to WOE’s performance is a novel form of self-supervised learning for open extractors using heuris— tic matches between Wikipedia infobox attribute values and corresponding sentences to construct training data. Like TextRunner, WOE’s extractor eschews lexicalized features and handles an unbounded set of semantic relations. WOE can operate in two modes: when restricted to POS tag features, it runs as quickly as TextRunner, but when set to use dependency-parse features its precision and recall rise even higher.</p><p>4 0.63525915 <a title="54-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-An_Open-Source_Package_for_Recognizing_Textual_Entailment.html">30 acl-2010-An Open-Source Package for Recognizing Textual Entailment</a></p>

If a small loss in translation quality can be tolerated for the sake of efficiency, user effort can be saved by interactively translating only those initial translations which the confidence measure classifies as incorrect. We apply confidence estimation as a way to achieve a balance between user effort savings and final translation error. Empirical results show that our proposal allows to obtain almost perfect translations while significantly reducing user effort.</p><p>6 0.55874348 <a title="54-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Improving_Arabic-to-English_Statistical_Machine_Translation_by_Reordering_Post-Verbal_Subjects_for_Alignment.html">145 acl-2010-Improving Arabic-to-English Statistical Machine Translation by Reordering Post-Verbal Subjects for Alignment</a></p>

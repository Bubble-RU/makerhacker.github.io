<p>Author: Mattia Tomasoni ; Minlie Huang</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a framework for automatically processing information coming from community Question Answering (cQA) portals with the purpose of generating a trustful, complete, relevant and succinct summary in response to a question. We exploit the metadata intrinsically present in User Generated Content (UGC) to bias automatic multi-document summarization techniques toward high quality information. We adopt a representation of concepts alternative to n-grams and propose two concept-scoring functions based on semantic overlap. Experimental re- sults on data drawn from Yahoo! Answers demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of ROUGE scores. We show that the information contained in the best answers voted by users of cQA portals can be successfully complemented by our method.</p><p>3 0.13741358 <a title="2-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Identifying_Text_Polarity_Using_Random_Walks.html">141 acl-2010-Identifying Text Polarity Using Random Walks</a></p>
<p>Author: Ahmed Hassan ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: Automatically identifying the polarity of words is a very important task in Natural Language Processing. It has applications in text classification, text filtering, analysis of product review, analysis of responses to surveys, and mining online discussions. We propose a method for identifying the polarity of words. We apply a Markov random walk model to a large word relatedness graph, producing a polarity estimate for any given word. A key advantage of the model is its ability to accurately and quickly assign a polarity sign and magnitude to any word. The method could be used both in a semi-supervised setting where a training set of labeled words is used, and in an unsupervised setting where a handful of seeds is used to define the two polarity classes. The method is experimentally tested using a manually labeled set of positive and negative words. It outperforms the state of the art methods in the semi-supervised setting. The results in the unsupervised setting is comparable to the best reported values. However, the proposed method is faster and does not need a large corpus.</p><p>4 0.13295615 <a title="2-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Creating_Robust_Supervised_Classifiers_via_Web-Scale_N-Gram_Data.html">76 acl-2010-Creating Robust Supervised Classifiers via Web-Scale N-Gram Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Shane Bergsma ; Emily Pitler ; Dekang Lin</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we systematically assess the value of using web-scale N-gram data in state-of-the-art supervised NLP classifiers. We compare classifiers that include or exclude features for the counts of various N-grams, where the counts are obtained from a web-scale auxiliary corpus. We show that including N-gram count features can advance the state-of-the-art accuracy on standard data sets for adjective ordering, spelling correction, noun compound bracketing, and verb part-of-speech disambiguation. More importantly, when operating on new domains, or when labeled training data is not plentiful, we show that using web-scale N-gram features is essential for achieving robust performance.</p><p>5 0.12821905 <a title="2-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Speech-Driven_Access_to_the_Deep_Web_on_Mobile_Devices.html">215 acl-2010-Speech-Driven Access to the Deep Web on Mobile Devices</a></p>

<p>Author: Baoxun Wang ; Xiaolong Wang ; Chengjie Sun ; Bingquan Liu ; Lin Sun</p><p>Abstract: Quantifying the semantic relevance between questions and their candidate answers is essential to answer detection in social media corpora. In this paper, a deep belief network is proposed to model the semantic relevance for question-answer pairs. Observing the textual similarity between the community-driven questionanswering (cQA) dataset and the forum dataset, we present a novel learning strategy to promote the performance of our method on the social community datasets without hand-annotating work. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the traditional approaches on both the cQA and the forum corpora.</p><p>4 0.57008016 <a title="2-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Now%2C_Where_Was_I%3F_Resumption_Strategies_for_an_In-Vehicle_Dialogue_System.html">179 acl-2010-Now, Where Was I? Resumption Strategies for an In-Vehicle Dialogue System</a></p>
<p>Author: Jessica Villing</p><p>Abstract: In-vehicle dialogue systems often contain more than one application, e.g. a navigation and a telephone application. This means that the user might, for example, interrupt the interaction with the telephone application to ask for directions from the navigation application, and then resume the dialogue with the telephone application. In this paper we present an analysis of interruption and resumption behaviour in human-human in-vehicle dialogues and also propose some implications for resumption strategies in an in-vehicle dialogue system.</p><p>5 0.5508914 <a title="2-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Non-Cooperation_in_Dialogue.html">178 acl-2010-Non-Cooperation in Dialogue</a></p>

<p>Author: Katrin Tomanek ; Udo Hahn ; Steffen Lohmann ; Jurgen Ziegler</p><p>Abstract: We report on an experiment to track complex decision points in linguistic metadata annotation where the decision behavior of annotators is observed with an eyetracking device. As experimental conditions we investigate different forms of textual context and linguistic complexity classes relative to syntax and semantics. Our data renders evidence that annotation performance depends on the semantic and syntactic complexity of the decision points and, more interestingly, indicates that fullscale context is mostly negligible with – the exception of semantic high-complexity cases. We then induce from this observational data a cognitively grounded cost model of linguistic meta-data annotations and compare it with existing non-cognitive models. Our data reveals that the cognitively founded model explains annotation costs (expressed in annotation time) more adequately than non-cognitive ones.</p><p>3 0.84112543 <a title="2-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Cross-Language_Document_Summarization_Based_on_Machine_Translation_Quality_Prediction.html">77 acl-2010-Cross-Language Document Summarization Based on Machine Translation Quality Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaojun Wan ; Huiying Li ; Jianguo Xiao</p><p>Abstract: Cross-language document summarization is a task of producing a summary in one language for a document set in a different language. Existing methods simply use machine translation for document translation or summary translation. However, current machine translation services are far from satisfactory, which results in that the quality of the cross-language summary is usually very poor, both in readability and content. In this paper, we propose to consider the translation quality of each sentence in the English-to-Chinese cross-language summarization process. First, the translation quality of each English sentence in the document set is predicted with the SVM regression method, and then the quality score of each sentence is incorporated into the summarization process. Finally, the English sentences with high translation quality and high informativeness are selected and translated to form the Chinese summary. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed approach. 1</p><p>4 0.84084904 <a title="2-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Automatic_Evaluation_of_Linguistic_Quality_in_Multi-Document_Summarization.html">38 acl-2010-Automatic Evaluation of Linguistic Quality in Multi-Document Summarization</a></p>
<p>Author: Emily Pitler ; Annie Louis ; Ani Nenkova</p><p>Abstract: To date, few attempts have been made to develop and validate methods for automatic evaluation of linguistic quality in text summarization. We present the first systematic assessment of several diverse classes of metrics designed to capture various aspects of well-written text. We train and test linguistic quality models on consecutive years of NIST evaluation data in order to show the generality of results. For grammaticality, the best results come from a set of syntactic features. Focus, coherence and referential clarity are best evaluated by a class of features measuring local coherence on the basis of cosine similarity between sentences, coreference informa- tion, and summarization specific features. Our best results are 90% accuracy for pairwise comparisons of competing systems over a test set of several inputs and 70% for ranking summaries of a specific input.</p><p>5 0.84009159 <a title="2-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Edit_Tree_Distance_Alignments_for_Semantic_Role_Labelling.html">94 acl-2010-Edit Tree Distance Alignments for Semantic Role Labelling</a></p>
<p>Author: Hector-Hugo Franco-Penya</p><p>Abstract: ―Tree SRL system‖ is a Semantic Role Labelling supervised system based on a tree-distance algorithm and a simple k-NN implementation. The novelty of the system lies in comparing the sentences as tree structures with multiple relations instead of extracting vectors of features for each relation and classifying them. The system was tested with the English CoNLL-2009 shared task data set where 79% accuracy was obtained. 1</p><p>6 0.83938909 <a title="2-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Syntactic_and_Semantic_Factors_in_Processing_Difficulty%3A_An_Integrated_Measure.html">220 acl-2010-Syntactic and Semantic Factors in Processing Difficulty: An Integrated Measure</a></p>

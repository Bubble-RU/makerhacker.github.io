</p><p>15 (2002) conducted early polarity classification of reviews using supervised approaches. [sent-53, score-0.178]
</p><p>16 They employed Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Naive Bayes and Maximum Entropy classifiers using a diverse set of features, such as unigrams, bigrams, binary and term frequency feature weights and others. [sent-54, score-0.335]
</p><p>17 They concluded that sentiment classification is more difficult that standard topic-based classification and that using a SVM classifier with binary unigrambased features produces the best results. [sent-55, score-0.496]
</p><p>18 A subsequent innovation was the detection and removal of the objective parts of documents and the application of a polarity classifier on the rest (Pang and Lee, 2004). [sent-56, score-0.188]
</p><p>19 They combined the produced appraisal groups with unigram-based document representations as features to a Support Vector Machine classifier (Witten and Frank, 1999), resulting in significant increases in accuracy. [sent-69, score-0.267]

</p><p>24 Despite the significant attention that sentiment analysis has received in recent years, the best accuracy without using complex features (Mullen  and Collier, 2004; Whitelaw et al. [sent-102, score-0.305]
</p><p>25 , 2007) is achieved by employing a binary weighting scheme (Pang et al. [sent-104, score-0.421]
</p><p>26 , 2002), where wi = 1, if tfi > 0 and wi = 0, if tfi = 0, where tfi is the number of times that term iappears in document D (henceforth raw term frequency) and utilizing a SVM classifier. [sent-105, score-1.266]
</p><p>27 It is of particular interest that using tfi in the document representation usually results in decreased accuracy, a result that appears to be in contrast with topic classification (Mccallum and Nigam, 1998; Pang et al. [sent-106, score-0.419]
</p><p>28 In this paper, we also utilize SVMs but our study is centered on whether more sophisticated than binary or raw term frequency weighting functions can improve classification accuracy. [sent-108, score-0.792]

</p><p>30 idf formula assigns weight wi to term iin document D as:  wi= tfi· idfi= tfi· logdNfi  (1)  where tfi is the number of times term ioccurs in D, idfi is the inverse document frequency of term i, N is the total number of documents and dfi is the number of documents that contain term i. [sent-114, score-1.913]
</p><p>31 The utilization of tfi in classification is rather straightforward and intuitive but, as previously discussed, usually results in decreased accuracy in sentiment analysis. [sent-115, score-0.624]
</p><p>32 On the other hand, using idf to assign weights to features is less intuitive, since it only provides information about the general distribution of term iamongst documents of all classes, without providing any additional evidence of class preference. [sent-116, score-0.624]
</p><p>33 The utilization of idf in information retrieval is based on its ability to distinguish between content-bearing words (words with some semantical meaning) and simple function words, but this behavior is at least ambiguous in classification. [sent-117, score-0.469]

</p><p>45 The above weighting scheme was appropriately named Delta tf. [sent-142, score-0.371]
</p><p>46 The produced results (Martineau and Finin, 2009) show that the approach produces better results than the simple tf or binary weighting scheme. [sent-144, score-0.706]
</p><p>47 Nonetheless, the approach doesn’t take into consideration a number of tested notions from IR, such as the non-linearity of term frequency to document relevancy (e. [sent-145, score-0.344]
</p><p>48 (2004)) according to which, the probability of a document being relevant to a query term is typically sublinear in relation to the number of times a query term appears in the document. [sent-148, score-0.477]
</p><p>49 Additionally, their approach doesn’t provide any sort of smoothing  for the dfi,j factor and is therefore susceptible to errors in corpora where a term occurs in documents of only one or the other class and therefore dfi,j = 0 . [sent-149, score-0.331]

</p><p>51 For ease of reference, we incorporate the BM25 tf and idf factors into the  SMART annotation scheme (last row of table 1 and 4th row of table 2), therefore the weight wi of term iin document D according to the BM25 scheme is notated as SMART. [sent-158, score-1.216]
</p><p>52 Most of the tf weighting functions in SMART and the BM25 model take into consideration the non-linearity of document relevance to term fre1Typically, a weighting function in the SMART system is defined as a pair of triples, i. [sent-160, score-1.317]

</p><p>54 In the context that the SMART annotation is used here, we will use the prefix SMART for the first part and a triple for the document representation in the second part, i. [sent-164, score-0.143]
</p><p>55 1389  quency and thus employ tf factors that scale sublinearly in relation to term frequency. [sent-168, score-0.531]
</p><p>56 Additionally, the BM25 tf variant also incorporates a scaling for the length of the document, taking into consideration that longer documents will by definition have more term occurences2. [sent-169, score-0.633]
</p><p>57 Effective weighting functions is a very active research area in information retrieval and it is outside the scope of this paper to provide an in-depth analysis but signifi-  cant research can be found in Salton and McGill (1986), Robertson et al. [sent-170, score-0.463]
</p><p>58 idf variants We apply the idea of localizing the estimation of idf values to documents of one class but employ more sophisticated term weighting functions adapted from the SMART retrieval system and the BM25 probabilistic model. [sent-176, score-1.585]
</p><p>59 The resulting idf weighting functions are presented in the lower part of table 2. [sent-177, score-0.721]
</p><p>60 We extend the original SMART annotation scheme by adding Delta (∆) variants of the original idf functions and additionally introduce smoothed Delta variants of the idf and the prob idf factors for completeness and comparative reasons, noted by their accented counterparts. [sent-178, score-1.582]
</p><p>61 For example, the weight of term iin document D according to the o∆(k)n weighting scheme where we employ the BM25 tf weighting function and utilize the difference of class-based BM25 idf values would be calculated as:  wi  =  (k1K+ + 1) tf ·i tfi· log(N1d−fi, d1f+i,1 0+.

</p><p>62 5)  −  (k1K+ + 1) tf ·i tfi· log(N2d−fi, d2f+i,2 0+. [sent-181, score-0.354]
</p><p>63 The above variation was made for two reasons: firstly, when the dfi’s are larger than 1then the smooth-  ing factor influences the final idf value only in a minor way in the revised formulation, since it is added only after the multiplication of the dfi with Ni (or its variation). [sent-196, score-0.491]
</p><p>64 Secondly, when dfi = 0, then the smoothing factor correctly adds only a small mass, avoiding a potential division by zero, where otherwise it would add a much greater mass, because it would be multiplied by Ni. [sent-197, score-0.21]
</p><p>65 The results presented in section 5 show that a number 1390  of weighting functions solidly outperform other state-of-the-art approaches. [sent-205, score-0.379]
</p><p>66 In the next section, we present the corpora that were used to study the effectiveness of different weighting schemes. [sent-206, score-0.302]

</p><p>70 For reference, in this setting the unnormalized vector using the raw tf approach (nnn) performs similar to the normalized (nnc) (83. [sent-274, score-0.425]
</p><p>71 Nonetheless, using any scaled tf weighting function (anc or onc) performs as well as the binary approach (87. [sent-278, score-0.76]
</p><p>72 Of interest is the fact that although the BM25 tf algorithm has proved much more successful in IR, the  same doesn’t apply in this setting and its accuracy is similar to the simpler augmented tf approach. [sent-281, score-0.747]
</p><p>73 Incorporating un-localized variants of idf (middle graph section) produces only small increases in accuracy. [sent-282, score-0.472]

</p><p>80 Additionally, using augmented, BM25 or binary tf weights is always better than raw term frequency, providing further support on the advantages of using sublinear tf weighting . [sent-311, score-1.374]

</p><p>82 idf by Martineau and Finin (2009) has a limitation of utilizing features with df > 2. [sent-314, score-0.342]
</p><p>83 The results indicate that the tf and the idf factor themselves aren’t of significant importance, as long as the former are scaled and the latter smoothed in some manner. [sent-324, score-0.857]
</p><p>84 Binary weights outperform raw term frequency weights and perform similarly with scaled tf’s. [sent-328, score-0.422]
</p><p>85 Non-localized variants of idf weights do provide a small advantage in this data set although the actual idf variant isn’t important, e. [sent-329, score-0.907]
</p><p>86 We focus our attention on the delta idf variants which provide the more interesting results. [sent-338, score-0.656]

<p>Author: Wei Wei ; Jon Atle Gulla</p><p>Abstract: Existing works on sentiment analysis on product reviews suffer from the following limitations: (1) The knowledge of hierarchical relationships of products attributes is not fully utilized. (2) Reviews or sentences mentioning several attributes associated with complicated sentiments are not dealt with very well. In this paper, we propose a novel HL-SOT approach to labeling a product’s attributes and their associated sentiments in product reviews by a Hierarchical Learning (HL) process with a defined Sentiment Ontology Tree (SOT).

<p>Author: Binyang Li ; Lanjun Zhou ; Shi Feng ; Kam-Fai Wong</p><p>Abstract: There is a growing research interest in opinion retrieval as on-line users’ opinions are becoming more and more popular in business, social networks, etc. Practically speaking, the goal of opinion retrieval is to retrieve documents, which entail opinions or comments, relevant to a target subject specified by the user’s query. A fundamental challenge in opinion retrieval is information representation. Existing research focuses on document-based approaches and documents are represented by bag-of-word. However, due to loss of contextual information, this representation fails to capture the associative information between an opinion and its corresponding target. It cannot distinguish different degrees of a sentiment word when associated with different targets. This in turn seriously affects opinion retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a sentence-based approach based on a new information representa- , tion, namely topic-sentiment word pair, to capture intra-sentence contextual information between an opinion and its target. Additionally, we consider inter-sentence information to capture the relationships among the opinions on the same topic. Finally, the two types of information are combined in a unified graph-based model, which can effectively rank the documents. Compared with existing approaches, experimental results on the COAE08 dataset showed that our graph-based model achieved significant improvement. 1</p><p>5 0.17855123 <a title="18-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Sentiment_Translation_through_Lexicon_Induction.html">210 acl-2010-Sentiment Translation through Lexicon Induction</a></p>

<p>Author: Ainur Yessenalina ; Yejin Choi ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: One ofthe central challenges in sentimentbased text categorization is that not every portion of a document is equally informative for inferring the overall sentiment of the document. Previous research has shown that enriching the sentiment labels with human annotators’ “rationales” can produce substantial improvements in categorization performance (Zaidan et al., 2007). We explore methods to automatically generate annotator rationales for document-level sentiment classification. Rather unexpectedly, we find the automatically generated rationales just as helpful as human rationales.</p><p>3 0.85073048 <a title="18-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-Sentiment_Learning_on_Product_Reviews_via_Sentiment_Ontology_Tree.html">209 acl-2010-Sentiment Learning on Product Reviews via Sentiment Ontology Tree</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Wei ; Jon Atle Gulla</p><p>Abstract: Existing works on sentiment analysis on product reviews suffer from the following limitations: (1) The knowledge of hierarchical relationships of products attributes is not fully utilized. (2) Reviews or sentences mentioning several attributes associated with complicated sentiments are not dealt with very well. In this paper, we propose a novel HL-SOT approach to labeling a product’s attributes and their associated sentiments in product reviews by a Hierarchical Learning (HL) process with a defined Sentiment Ontology Tree (SOT). The empirical analysis against a humanlabeled data set demonstrates promising and reasonable performance of the proposed HL-SOT approach. While this paper is mainly on sentiment analysis on reviews of one product, our proposed HLSOT approach is easily generalized to labeling a mix of reviews of more than one products.</p><p>4 0.76655495 <a title="18-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Generating_Focused_Topic-Specific_Sentiment_Lexicons.html">123 acl-2010-Generating Focused Topic-Specific Sentiment Lexicons</a></p>

We motivate the need for such lexicons in the field of media analysis, describe a bootstrapping method for generating a topic-specific lexicon from a general purpose polarity lexicon, and evaluate the quality of the generated lexicons both manually and using a TREC Blog track test set for opinionated blog post retrieval. Although the generated lexicons can be an order of magnitude more selective than the general purpose lexicon, they maintain, or even improve, the performance of an opin- ion retrieval system.</p><p>5 0.74189848 <a title="18-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Sentiment_Translation_through_Lexicon_Induction.html">210 acl-2010-Sentiment Translation through Lexicon Induction</a></p>

<p>Author: Verena Henrich ; Erhard Hinrichs</p><p>Abstract: GernEdiT (short for: GermaNet Editing Tool) offers a graphical interface for the lexicographers and developers of GermaNet to access and modify the underlying GermaNet resource. GermaNet is a lexical-semantic wordnet that is modeled after the Princeton WordNet for English. The traditional lexicographic development of GermaNet was error prone and time-consuming, mainly due to a complex underlying data format and no opportunity of automatic consistency checks. GernEdiT replaces the earlier development by a more userfriendly tool, which facilitates automatic checking of internal consistency and correctness of the linguistic resource. This paper pre- sents all these core functionalities of GernEdiT along with details about its usage and usability. 1</p><p>2 0.94512933 <a title="18-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Estimating_Strictly_Piecewise_Distributions.html">103 acl-2010-Estimating Strictly Piecewise Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Jeffrey Heinz ; James Rogers</p><p>Abstract: Strictly Piecewise (SP) languages are a subclass of regular languages which encode certain kinds of long-distance dependencies that are found in natural languages. Like the classes in the Chomsky and Subregular hierarchies, there are many independently converging characterizations of the SP class (Rogers et al., to appear). Here we define SP distributions and show that they can be efficiently estimated from positive data.</p><p>3 0.89691156 <a title="18-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Syntactic_and_Semantic_Factors_in_Processing_Difficulty%3A_An_Integrated_Measure.html">220 acl-2010-Syntactic and Semantic Factors in Processing Difficulty: An Integrated Measure</a></p>
<p>Author: Jeff Mitchell ; Mirella Lapata ; Vera Demberg ; Frank Keller</p><p>Abstract: The analysis of reading times can provide insights into the processes that underlie language comprehension, with longer reading times indicating greater cognitive load. There is evidence that the language processor is highly predictive, such that prior context allows upcoming linguistic material to be anticipated. Previous work has investigated the contributions of semantic and syntactic contexts in isolation, essentially treating them as independent factors. In this paper we analyze reading times in terms of a single predictive measure which integrates a model of semantic composition with an incremental parser and a language model.</p><p>4 0.87768704 <a title="18-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Starting_from_Scratch_in_Semantic_Role_Labeling.html">216 acl-2010-Starting from Scratch in Semantic Role Labeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Connor ; Yael Gertner ; Cynthia Fisher ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: A fundamental step in sentence comprehension involves assigning semantic roles to sentence constituents. To accomplish this, the listener must parse the sentence, find constituents that are candidate arguments, and assign semantic roles to those constituents. Each step depends on prior lexical and syntactic knowledge. Where do children learning their first languages begin in solving this problem? In this paper we focus on the parsing and argumentidentification steps that precede Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) training. We combine a simplified SRL with an unsupervised HMM part of speech tagger, and experiment with psycholinguisticallymotivated ways to label clusters resulting from the HMM so that they can be used to parse input for the SRL system. The results show that proposed shallow representations of sentence structure are robust to reductions in parsing accuracy, and that the contribution of alternative representations of sentence structure to successful semantic role labeling varies with the integrity of the parsing and argumentidentification stages.</p><p>same-paper 5 0.85674232 <a title="18-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-A_Study_of_Information_Retrieval_Weighting_Schemes_for_Sentiment_Analysis.html">18 acl-2010-A Study of Information Retrieval Weighting Schemes for Sentiment Analysis</a></p>

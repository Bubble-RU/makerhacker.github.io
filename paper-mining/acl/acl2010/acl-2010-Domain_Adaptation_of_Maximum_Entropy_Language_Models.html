</p><p>2 Experiments show that the method consistently outperforms linear interpolation which is typically used in such cases. [sent-4, score-0.208]
</p><p>3 1 Introduction In large vocabulary speech recognition, a language  model (LM) is typically estimated from large amounts of written text data. [sent-5, score-0.382]
</p><p>4 However, recognition is typically applied to speech that is stylistically different from written language. [sent-6, score-0.417]
</p><p>5 For example, in an often-tried setting, speech recognition is applied to broadcast news, that includes introductory segments, conversations and spontaneous interviews. [sent-7, score-0.382]
</p><p>6 To decrease the mismatch between training and test data, often a small amount of speech data is human-transcribed. [sent-8, score-0.158]
</p><p>7 A LM is then built by interpolating the models estimated from large corpus of written language and the small corpus of transcribed data. [sent-9, score-0.256]
</p><p>8 However, in practice, different models might be of different importance depending on the word context. [sent-10, score-0.093]
</p><p>9 Global interpolation doesn’t take such variability into account and all predictions are weighted across models identically, regardless of the context. [sent-11, score-0.24]
</p><p>10 In this paper we investigate a recently proposed Bayesian adaptation approach (Daume III, 2007; Finkel and Manning, 2009) for adapting a conditional maximum entropy (ME) LM (Rosenfeld, 1996) to a new domain, given a large corpus of  out-of-domain training data and a small corpus of in-domain data. [sent-12, score-0.397]
</p><p>11 fi paper is that we show how the suggested hierarchical adaptation can be used with suitable priors and combined with the class-based speedup technique (Goodman, 2001) to adapt ME LMs in large-vocabulary speech recognition when the amount of target data is small. [sent-15, score-0.711]
</p><p>12 The results outperform the conventional linear interpolation of background and target models in both N-grams and ME models. [sent-16, score-0.24]
</p><p>13 It seems that with the adapted ME models, the same recognition accuracy for the target evaluation data can be obtained with 50% less  adaptation data than in interpolated ME models. [sent-17, score-0.584]
</p><p>14 2  Review of Conditional Maximum Entropy Language Models  Maximum entropy (ME) modeling is a framework that has been used in a wide area of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. [sent-18, score-0.095]
</p><p>15 A conditional ME model has the following form:  P(x|h) =Pxe0PeiPλjiλfij(fxj,(hx)0,h)  (1)  where x is an outcomPe (in case of a LM, a word), h is a context (the word history), and x0 a set of all possible outcomes (words). [sent-19, score-0.048]
</p><p>16 During ME training, the optimal weights λi corresponding to features fi(x, h) are learned. [sent-21, score-0.058]
</p><p>17 More precisely, finding the ME model is equal to finding weights that maximize the log-likelihood L(X; Λ) of the training data X. [sent-22, score-0.093]
</p><p>18 The weights are learned via improved iterative scaling algorithm or some of its modern fast counterparts (i. [sent-23, score-0.058]
</p><p>19 Since LMs typically have a vocabulary of tens of thousands of words, the use of a normalization factor over all possible outcomes makes estimating a ME LM very memory and time consuming. [sent-26, score-0.186]
</p><p>20 Goodman (2001) proposed a class-based method that drastically reduces the resource requirements for training such models. [sent-27, score-0.082]

</p><p>22 It turns out that normalizing the second model is also easier: for a context h, C(w), we only need to normalize over words that belong to class C(w), since other words cannot occur in this context. [sent-36, score-0.054]
</p><p>23 This decomposition can be further extended by using hierarchical classes. [sent-37, score-0.107]
</p><p>24 To avoid overfitting, ME models are usually smoothed (regularized). [sent-38, score-0.093]
</p><p>25 The most widely used smoothing method for ME LMs is Gaussian priors (Chen and Rosenfeld, 2000): a zero-mean prior with a given variance is added to all feature weights, and the model optimization criteria becomes:  L0(X;Λ) = L(X;Λ) −Xi=F12λσi2i2  (3)  where F is the number of feature functions. [sent-39, score-0.34]
</p><p>26 The optimal variance is usually estimated on a development set. [sent-41, score-0.261]
</p><p>27 Intuitively, this method encourages feature weights to be smaller, by penalizing weights with big absolute values. [sent-42, score-0.161]
</p><p>28 3  Domain Adaptation of Maximum Entropy Models  Recently, a hierarchical Bayesian adaptation method was proposed that can be applied to a large family of discriminative learning tasks (such as ME models, SVMs) (Daume III, 2007; Finkel and Manning, 2009). [sent-43, score-0.327]
</p><p>29 In NLP problems, data often comes from different sources (e. [sent-44, score-0.046]
</p><p>30 There are three classic approaches for building models from multiple sources. [sent-47, score-0.093]
</p><p>31 The third and often the best performing approach is to train separate models for each data source, apply them to test data and interpolate the results. [sent-51, score-0.093]
</p><p>32 The hierarchical Bayesian adaptation method is a generalization of the three approaches described above. [sent-52, score-0.327]
</p><p>33 The hierarchical model jointly optimizes global and domain-specific parameters, using parameters built from pooled data as priors  for domain-specific parameters. [sent-53, score-0.565]
</p><p>34 In other words, instead of using smoothing to encourage parameters to be closer to zero, it encourages domainspecific model parameters to be closer to the corresponding global parameters, while a zero mean Gaussian prior is still applied for global parameters. [sent-54, score-0.714]
</p><p>35 Intuitively, this approach can be described as follows: the domain-specific parameters are largely determined by global data, unless there is good domainspecific evidence that they should be different. [sent-56, score-0.287]
</p><p>36 The key to this approach is that the global and domain-specific parameters are learnedjointly, not hierarchically. [sent-57, score-0.247]
</p><p>37 This allows domain-specific parameters to influence the global parameters, and vice versa. [sent-58, score-0.247]
</p><p>38 −XiF=1λ2σ∗2∗,2i  (4)  where Xd is data for domain d, λ∗,i the global parameters, λd,i the domain-specific parameters, σ∗2 the global variance and σd2 the domain-specific va∗riances. [sent-60, score-0.511]
</p><p>39 The global and domain-specific variances are optimized on the heldout data. [sent-61, score-0.234]
</p><p>40 Usually, larger values are used for global parameters and for domains with more data, while for domains with less data, the variance is typically set to be smaller, encouraging the domain-specific parameters to be closer to global values. [sent-62, score-0.783]
</p><p>41 This adaptation scheme is very similar to the approaches proposed by (Chelba and Acero, 2006) and (Chen, 2009b): both use a model estimated from background data as a prior when learning a model from in-domain data. [sent-63, score-0.294]
</p><p>42 The main difference is the fact that in this method, the models are estimated jointly while in the other works, back302  ground model has to be estimated before learning  the in-domain model. [sent-64, score-0.278]
</p><p>43 4  Experiments  In this section, we look at experimental results over two speech recognition tasks. [sent-65, score-0.235]
</p><p>44 This recognition task consists of the English broadcast news section of the 2003 NIST Rich Transcription Evaluation Data. [sent-68, score-0.306]
</p><p>45 The data includes six news recordings from six different sources with a total length of 176 minutes. [sent-69, score-0.143]
</p><p>46 As acoustic models, the CMU Sphinx open source triphone HUB4 models for wideband (16kHz) speech1 were used. [sent-70, score-0.31]
</p><p>47 The models have been trained using 140 hours of speech. [sent-71, score-0.135]
</p><p>48 For training the LMs, two sources were used: first 5M sentences from the Gigaword (2nd ed. [sent-72, score-0.081]
</p><p>49 5M words), and broadcast news transcriptions from the TDT4 corpus (1. [sent-74, score-0.351]
</p><p>50 The latter was treated as in-domain data in the  adaptation experiments. [sent-76, score-0.22]
</p><p>51 The audio used for testing was segmented into parts of up to 20 seconds in length. [sent-81, score-0.04]
</p><p>52 A three-pass recognition strategy was applied: the first pass recognition hypotheses were used for calculating MLLR-adapted models for each speaker. [sent-86, score-0.399]
</p><p>53 In the second pass, the adapted acoustic models were used for generating a 5000-best list of hypotheses for each segment. [sent-87, score-0.318]
</p><p>54 In the third pass, the ME LM was used to re-rank the hypotheses and select the best one. [sent-88, score-0.042]
</p><p>55 The trigram model was an interpolation of source-specific models which were estimated using Kneser-Ney discounting. [sent-90, score-0.364]
</p><p>56 The second recognition task consists of four recordings from different live talk programs from 1http : / /www . [sent-92, score-0.352]
</p><p>57 edu / sphinx / mode l / s three Estonian radio stations. [sent-96, score-0.225]
</p><p>58 The acoustic models were trained on various wideband Estonian speech corpora: the BABEL speech database (9h), transcriptions of Estonian broadcast news (7. [sent-99, score-0.833]
</p><p>59 For training the LMs, two sources were used: about 10M sentences from various Estonian newspapers, and manual transcriptions of 10 hours of live talk programs from three Estonian radio stations. [sent-102, score-0.548]
</p><p>60 As Estonian is a highly inflective language, morphemes are used as basic units in the LM. [sent-104, score-0.046]
</p><p>61 After such processing, the newspaper corpus includes of 185M tokens, and the transcribed data 104K tokens. [sent-106, score-0.042]
</p><p>62 A vocabulary of 30K tokens was used for this task, with an OOV rate of 1. [sent-107, score-0.112]
</p><p>63 As with English data, a three-pass recognition strategy involving MLLR adaptation was applied. [sent-110, score-0.332]
</p><p>64 2  Results  For both tasks, we rescored the N-best lists in two different ways: (1) using linear interpolation of source-specific ME models and (2) using hierarchically domain-adapted ME model (as described in previous chapter). [sent-112, score-0.29]
</p><p>65 The English ME models had a three-level and Estonian models a four-level class hierarchy. [sent-113, score-0.186]
</p><p>66 The number of classes at each  level was determined experimentally so as to optimize the resource requirements for training ME models (specifically, the number of classes was 150, 1000 and 5000 for the English models and 20, 150, 1000 and 6000 for the Estonian models). [sent-115, score-0.346]
</p><p>67 We used unigram, bigram and trigram features that occurred at least twice in the training data. [sent-116, score-0.085]
</p><p>68 The feature set was identical for interpolated and adapted models. [sent-118, score-0.252]
</p><p>69 For the English task, we also explored the efficiency of these two approaches with varying size of adaptation data: we repeated the experiments when using one eighth, one quarter, half and all of the TDT4 transcription data for interpolation/adaptation. [sent-121, score-0.283]
</p><p>70 In all cases, interpolation weights were re-optimized and new Gaussian variance values were heuristically determined. [sent-123, score-0.433]
</p><p>71 The TADM toolkit2 was used for estimating ME models, utilizing its implementation of the conjugate gradient algorithm. [sent-124, score-0.087]
</p><p>72 The variance parameters were chosen  heuristically based on light tuning on development set perplexity. [sent-126, score-0.33]
</p><p>73 For the source-specific ME models, the variance was fixed on per-model basis. [sent-127, score-0.187]
</p><p>74 For the adapted model, that jointly models global and domain-specific data, the Gaussian priors were fixed for each hierarchy node (i. [sent-128, score-0.489]
</p><p>75 , the variance was fixed across global, out-of-domain, and in-domain parameters). [sent-130, score-0.187]
</p><p>76 Table 1 lists values for the variances of Gaussian priors (as in equations 3 and 4) that we used in the experiments. [sent-131, score-0.189]
</p><p>77 In other publications, the variance values are often normalized to the size of the data. [sent-132, score-0.187]
</p><p>78 We chose not to normalize the values, since in the hierarchical adaptation scheme, also data from other domains have impact on the learned model parameters, thus 2http : / /t adm . [sent-133, score-0.381]
</p><p>79 net /  it’s not possible to simply normalize the variances. [sent-135, score-0.054]
</p><p>80 Perplexity and word error rate (WER) results of the interpolated and adapted models are compared. [sent-137, score-0.38]
</p><p>81 For the Estonian task, letter error rate (LER) is  also reported, since it tends to be a more indicative measure of speech recognition quality for highly inflected languages. [sent-138, score-0.27]
</p><p>82 In all experiments, using the adapted models resulted in lower perplexity and lower error rate. [sent-139, score-0.318]
</p><p>83 Improvements in the English experiment were less evident than in the Estonian system, with under 10% improvement in perplexity and 1-3% in WER, against 15% and 4% for the Estonian experiment. [sent-140, score-0.111]
</p><p>84 In most cases, there was a significant improvement in WER when using the adapted ME model (according to the Wilcoxon test), with and exception of the English experiments on the 292K and 591K data sets. [sent-141, score-0.114]
</p><p>85 The comparison between N-gram models and ME models is not entirely fair since ME models are actually class-based. [sent-142, score-0.279]
</p><p>86 Such transformation introduces additional smoothing into the model and can improve model perplexity, as also noticed by Goodman (2001). [sent-143, score-0.053]
</p><p>87 5  Discussion  In this paper we have tested a hierarchical adaptation method (Daume III, 2007; Finkel and Man-  ning, 2009) on building style-adapted LMs for speech recognition. [sent-144, score-0.45]
</p><p>88 We showed that the method achieves consistently lower error rates than when using linear interpolation which is typically used in such scenarios. [sent-145, score-0.208]
</p><p>89 The tested method is ideally suited for language modeling in speech recognition: we almost always have access to large amounts of data from written sources but commonly the speech to be recognized is stylistically noticeably different. [sent-146, score-0.413]
</p><p>90 The hierarchical adaptation method enables to use even a small amount of in-domain data to modify the parameters estimated from out-of-domain data, if there is enough evidence. [sent-147, score-0.503]
</p><p>91 As Finkel and Manning (2009) point out, the hierarchical nature of the method makes it possible to estimate highly specific models: we could draw style-specific models from general high-level priors, and topic-and-style specific models from style-specific priors. [sent-148, score-0.293]
</p><p>92 Furthermore, the models don’t have to be hierarchical: it is easy to generalize the method to general multilevel approach where a model is drawn from multiple priors. [sent-149, score-0.093]

</p><p>95 First, training ME LMs in general has much higher resource requirements than training N-gram models which are typically used in speech recognition. [sent-178, score-0.394]
</p><p>96 Moreover, training hierarchical ME models requires even more memory than training simple ME models, proportional to the number of nodes in the hierarchy. [sent-179, score-0.27]
</p><p>97 It is also difficult to determine good variance values σi2 for the global and domain-specific priors. [sent-181, score-0.332]

<p>Author: Jenny Rose Finkel ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: One of the main obstacles to producing high quality joint models is the lack of jointly annotated data. Joint modeling of multiple natural language processing tasks outperforms single-task models learned from the same data, but still underperforms compared to single-task models learned on the more abundant quantities of available single-task annotated data. In this paper we present a novel model which makes use of additional single-task annotated data to improve the performance of a joint model. Our model utilizes a hierarchical prior to link the feature weights for shared features in several single-task models and the joint model. Experiments on joint parsing and named entity recog- nition, using the OntoNotes corpus, show that our hierarchical joint model can produce substantial gains over a joint model trained on only the jointly annotated data.</p><p>4 0.13320917 <a title="91-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Personalising_Speech-To-Speech_Translation_in_the_EMIME_Project.html">193 acl-2010-Personalising Speech-To-Speech Translation in the EMIME Project</a></p>

We have employed an HMM statistical framework for both speech recognition and synthesis which provides transformation mechanisms to adapt the synthesized voice in TTS (text-to-speech) using the recognized voice in ASR (automatic speech recognition). An important application for this research is personalised speech-to-speech translation that will use the voice of the speaker in the input language to utter the translated sentences in the output language. In mobile environments this enhances the users’ interaction across language barriers by making the output speech sound more like the original speaker’s way of speaking, even if she or he could not speak the output language.</p><p>5 0.084283292 <a title="91-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-A_Risk_Minimization_Framework_for_Extractive_Speech_Summarization.html">14 acl-2010-A Risk Minimization Framework for Extractive Speech Summarization</a></p>

In addition, the introduction of various loss functions also provides the summarization framework with a flexible but systematic way to render the redundancy and coherence relationships among sentences and between sentences and the whole document, respectively. Experiments on speech summarization show that the methods deduced from our framework are very competitive with existing summarization approaches. 1</p><p>6 0.076109849 <a title="91-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Phylogenetic_Grammar_Induction.html">195 acl-2010-Phylogenetic Grammar Induction</a></p>

We have employed an HMM statistical framework for both speech recognition and synthesis which provides transformation mechanisms to adapt the synthesized voice in TTS (text-to-speech) using the recognized voice in ASR (automatic speech recognition). An important application for this research is personalised speech-to-speech translation that will use the voice of the speaker in the input language to utter the translated sentences in the output language. In mobile environments this enhances the users’ interaction across language barriers by making the output speech sound more like the original speaker’s way of speaking, even if she or he could not speak the output language.</p><p>3 0.76038992 <a title="91-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-Correcting_Errors_in_Speech_Recognition_with_Articulatory_Dynamics.html">74 acl-2010-Correcting Errors in Speech Recognition with Articulatory Dynamics</a></p>
<p>Author: Frank Rudzicz</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel mechanism for incorporating articulatory dynamics into speech recognition with the theory of task dynamics. This system reranks sentencelevel hypotheses by the likelihoods of their hypothetical articulatory realizations which are derived from relationships learned with aligned acoustic/articulatory data. Experiments compare this with two baseline systems, namely an acoustic hidden Markov model and a dynamic Bayes network augmented with discretized representations of the vocal tract. Our system based on task dynamics reduces worderror rates significantly by 10.2% relative to the best baseline models.</p><p>4 0.72713536 <a title="91-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Intelligent_Selection_of_Language_Model_Training_Data.html">151 acl-2010-Intelligent Selection of Language Model Training Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Robert C. Moore ; William Lewis</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of selecting nondomain-specific language model training data to build auxiliary language models for use in tasks such as machine translation. Our approach is based on comparing the cross-entropy, according to domainspecific and non-domain-specifc language models, for each sentence of the text source used to produce the latter language model. We show that this produces better language models, trained on less data, than both random data selection and two other previously proposed methods.</p><p>5 0.71520531 <a title="91-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-How_Spoken_Language_Corpora_Can_Refine_Current_Speech_Motor_Training_Methodologies.html">137 acl-2010-How Spoken Language Corpora Can Refine Current Speech Motor Training Methodologies</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniil Umanski ; Federico Sangati</p><p>Abstract: The growing availability of spoken language corpora presents new opportunities for enriching the methodologies of speech and language therapy. In this paper, we present a novel approach for constructing speech motor exercises, based on linguistic knowledge extracted from spoken language corpora. In our study with the Dutch Spoken Corpus, syllabic inventories were obtained by means of automatic syllabification of the spoken language data. Our experimental syllabification method exhibited a reliable performance, and allowed for the acquisition of syllabic tokens from the corpus. Consequently, the syl- labic tokens were integrated in a tool for clinicians, a result which holds the potential of contributing to the current state of speech motor training methodologies.</p><p>6 0.6144259 <a title="91-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Hierarchical_Joint_Learning%3A_Improving_Joint_Parsing_and_Named_Entity_Recognition_with_Non-Jointly_Labeled_Data.html">132 acl-2010-Hierarchical Joint Learning: Improving Joint Parsing and Named Entity Recognition with Non-Jointly Labeled Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Prettenhofer ; Benno Stein</p><p>Abstract: We present a new approach to crosslanguage text classification that builds on structural correspondence learning, a recently proposed theory for domain adaptation. The approach uses unlabeled documents, along with a simple word translation oracle, in order to induce taskspecific, cross-lingual word correspondences. We report on analyses that reveal quantitative insights about the use of unlabeled data and the complexity of interlanguage correspondence modeling. We conduct experiments in the field of cross-language sentiment classification, employing English as source language, and German, French, and Japanese as target languages. The results are convincing; they demonstrate both the robustness and the competitiveness of the presented ideas.</p><p>5 0.51354033 <a title="91-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Experiments_in_Graph-Based_Semi-Supervised_Learning_Methods_for_Class-Instance_Acquisition.html">109 acl-2010-Experiments in Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning Methods for Class-Instance Acquisition</a></p>
<p>Author: Partha Pratim Talukdar ; Fernando Pereira</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms have been successfully used to extract class-instance pairs from large unstructured and structured text collections. However, a careful comparison of different graph-based SSL algorithms on that task has been lacking. We compare three graph-based SSL algorithms for class-instance acquisition on a variety of graphs constructed from different domains. We find that the recently proposed MAD algorithm is the most effective. We also show that class-instance extraction can be significantly improved by adding semantic information in the form of instance-attribute edges derived from an independently developed knowledge base. All of our code and data will be made publicly available to encourage reproducible research in this area.</p><p>6 0.50657696 <a title="91-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Cross_Lingual_Adaptation%3A_An_Experiment_on_Sentiment_Classifications.html">80 acl-2010-Cross Lingual Adaptation: An Experiment on Sentiment Classifications</a></p>

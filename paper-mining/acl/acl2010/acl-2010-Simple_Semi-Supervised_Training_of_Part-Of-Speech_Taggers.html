<p>Author: Rasoul Samad Zadeh Kaljahi</p><p>Abstract: Supervised semantic role labeling (SRL) systems trained on hand-crafted annotated corpora have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, creating such corpora is tedious and costly, with the resulting corpora not sufficiently representative of the language. This paper describes a part of an ongoing work on applying bootstrapping methods to SRL to deal with this problem. Previous work shows that, due to the complexity of SRL, this task is not straight forward. One major difficulty is the propagation of classification noise into the successive iterations. We address this problem by employing balancing and preselection methods for self-training, as a bootstrapping algorithm. The proposed methods could achieve improvement over the base line, which do not use these methods. 1</p><p>3 0.1462356 <a title="212-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Phrase-Based_Statistical_Language_Generation_Using_Graphical_Models_and_Active_Learning.html">194 acl-2010-Phrase-Based Statistical Language Generation Using Graphical Models and Active Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Francois Mairesse ; Milica Gasic ; Filip Jurcicek ; Simon Keizer ; Blaise Thomson ; Kai Yu ; Steve Young</p><p>Abstract: Most previous work on trainable language generation has focused on two paradigms: (a) using a statistical model to rank a set of generated utterances, or (b) using statistics to inform the generation decision process. Both approaches rely on the existence of a handcrafted generator, which limits their scalability to new domains. This paper presents BAGEL, a statistical language generator which uses dynamic Bayesian networks to learn from semantically-aligned data produced by 42 untrained annotators. A human evaluation shows that BAGEL can generate natural and informative utterances from unseen inputs in the information presentation domain. Additionally, generation perfor- mance on sparse datasets is improved significantly by using certainty-based active learning, yielding ratings close to the human gold standard with a fraction of the data.</p><p>4 0.12219819 <a title="212-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Dynamic_Programming_for_Linear-Time_Incremental_Parsing.html">93 acl-2010-Dynamic Programming for Linear-Time Incremental Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Liang Huang ; Kenji Sagae</p><p>Abstract: Incremental parsing techniques such as shift-reduce have gained popularity thanks to their efficiency, but there remains a major problem: the search is greedy and only explores a tiny fraction of the whole space (even with beam search) as opposed to dynamic programming. We show that, surprisingly, dynamic programming is in fact possible for many shift-reduce parsers, by merging “equivalent” stacks based on feature values. Empirically, our algorithm yields up to a five-fold speedup over a state-of-the-art shift-reduce depen- dency parser with no loss in accuracy. Better search also leads to better learning, and our final parser outperforms all previously reported dependency parsers for English and Chinese, yet is much faster.</p><p>5 0.11470284 <a title="212-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Improved_Unsupervised_POS_Induction_through_Prototype_Discovery.html">144 acl-2010-Improved Unsupervised POS Induction through Prototype Discovery</a></p>
<p>Author: Omri Abend ; Roi Reichart ; Ari Rappoport</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel fully unsupervised algorithm for POS induction from plain text, motivated by the cognitive notion of prototypes. The algorithm first identifies landmark clusters of words, serving as the cores of the induced POS categories. The rest of the words are subsequently mapped to these clusters. We utilize morphological and distributional representations computed in a fully unsupervised manner. We evaluate our algorithm on English and German, achieving the best reported results for this task.</p><p>6 0.11306928 <a title="212-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Efficient_Optimization_of_an_MDL-Inspired_Objective_Function_for_Unsupervised_Part-Of-Speech_Tagging.html">96 acl-2010-Efficient Optimization of an MDL-Inspired Objective Function for Unsupervised Part-Of-Speech Tagging</a></p>

<p>Author: Ashish Vaswani ; Adam Pauls ; David Chiang</p><p>Abstract: The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle is a method for model selection that trades off between the explanation of the data by the model and the complexity of the model itself. Inspired by the MDL principle, we develop an objective function for generative models that captures the description of the data by the model (log-likelihood) and the description of the model (model size). We also develop a efficient general search algorithm based on the MAP-EM framework to optimize this function. Since recent work has shown that minimizing the model size in a Hidden Markov Model for part-of-speech (POS) tagging leads to higher accuracies, we test our approach by applying it to this problem. The search algorithm involves a simple change to EM and achieves high POS tagging accuracies on both English and Italian data sets.</p><p>4 0.57671207 <a title="212-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Efficient_Staggered_Decoding_for_Sequence_Labeling.html">98 acl-2010-Efficient Staggered Decoding for Sequence Labeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Nobuhiro Kaji ; Yasuhiro Fujiwara ; Naoki Yoshinaga ; Masaru Kitsuregawa</p><p>Abstract: The Viterbi algorithm is the conventional decoding algorithm most widely adopted for sequence labeling. Viterbi decoding is, however, prohibitively slow when the label set is large, because its time complexity is quadratic in the number of labels. This paper proposes an exact decoding algorithm that overcomes this problem. A novel property of our algorithm is that it efficiently reduces the labels to be decoded, while still allowing us to check the optimality of the solution. Experiments on three tasks (POS tagging, joint POS tagging and chunking, and supertagging) show that the new algorithm is several orders of magnitude faster than the basic Viterbi and a state-of-the-art algo- rithm, CARPEDIEM (Esposito and Radicioni, 2009).</p><p>5 0.57389361 <a title="212-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-SVD_and_Clustering_for_Unsupervised_POS_Tagging.html">205 acl-2010-SVD and Clustering for Unsupervised POS Tagging</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Lamar ; Yariv Maron ; Mark Johnson ; Elie Bienenstock</p><p>Abstract: We revisit the algorithm of Schütze (1995) for unsupervised part-of-speech tagging. The algorithm uses reduced-rank singular value decomposition followed by clustering to extract latent features from context distributions. As implemented here, it achieves state-of-the-art tagging accuracy at considerably less cost than more recent methods. It can also produce a range of finer-grained taggings, with potential applications to various tasks. 1</p><p>6 0.53124958 <a title="212-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Inducing_Domain-Specific_Semantic_Class_Taggers_from_%28Almost%29_Nothing.html">150 acl-2010-Inducing Domain-Specific Semantic Class Taggers from (Almost) Nothing</a></p>

The model considers all words necessary for selection of parsing actions by including words in the form of trees. It chooses the most probable head candidate from among the trees and uses this candidate to select a parsing action. In an evaluation experiment using the Penn Treebank (WSJ section), the proposed model achieved higher accuracy than did previous deterministic models. Although the proposed model’s worst-case time complexity is O(n2), the experimental results demonstrated an average pars- ing time not much slower than O(n).</p><p>6 0.60843462 <a title="212-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Open-Domain_Semantic_Role_Labeling_by_Modeling_Word_Spans.html">184 acl-2010-Open-Domain Semantic Role Labeling by Modeling Word Spans</a></p>

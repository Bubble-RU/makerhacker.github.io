<p>Author: Terry Koo ; Michael Collins</p><p>Abstract: We present algorithms for higher-order dependency parsing that are “third-order” in the sense that they can evaluate substructures containing three dependencies, and “efficient” in the sense that they require only O(n4) time. Importantly, our new parsers can utilize both sibling-style and grandchild-style interactions. We evaluate our parsers on the Penn Treebank and Prague Dependency Treebank, achieving unlabeled attachment scores of 93.04% and 87.38%, respectively.</p><p>3 0.22159041 <a title="83-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Importance_of_Linguistic_Constraints_in_Statistical_Dependency_Parsing.html">143 acl-2010-Importance of Linguistic Constraints in Statistical Dependency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Bharat Ram Ambati</p><p>Abstract: Statistical systems with high accuracy are very useful in real-world applications. If these systems can capture basic linguistic information, then the usefulness of these statistical systems improve a lot. This paper is an attempt at incorporating linguistic constraints in statistical dependency parsing. We consider a simple linguistic constraint that a verb should not have multiple subjects/objects as its children in the dependency tree. We first describe the importance of this constraint considering Machine Translation systems which use dependency parser output, as an example application. We then show how the current state-ofthe-art dependency parsers violate this constraint. We present two new methods to handle this constraint. We evaluate our methods on the state-of-the-art dependency parsers for Hindi and Czech. 1</p><p>4 0.18310337 <a title="83-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Bitext_Dependency_Parsing_with_Bilingual_Subtree_Constraints.html">52 acl-2010-Bitext Dependency Parsing with Bilingual Subtree Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenliang Chen ; Jun'ichi Kazama ; Kentaro Torisawa</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a dependency parsing method that uses bilingual constraints to improve the accuracy of parsing bilingual texts (bitexts). In our method, a targetside tree fragment that corresponds to a source-side tree fragment is identified via word alignment and mapping rules that are automatically learned. Then it is verified by checking the subtree list that is collected from large scale automatically parsed data on the target side. Our method, thus, requires gold standard trees only on the source side of a bilingual corpus in the training phase, unlike the joint parsing model, which requires gold standard trees on the both sides. Compared to the reordering constraint model, which requires the same training data as ours, our method achieved higher accuracy because ofricher bilingual constraints. Experiments on the translated portion of the Chinese Treebank show that our system outperforms monolingual parsers by 2.93 points for Chinese and 1.64 points for English.</p><p>5 0.17198198 <a title="83-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Dynamic_Programming_for_Linear-Time_Incremental_Parsing.html">93 acl-2010-Dynamic Programming for Linear-Time Incremental Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Liang Huang ; Kenji Sagae</p><p>Abstract: Incremental parsing techniques such as shift-reduce have gained popularity thanks to their efficiency, but there remains a major problem: the search is greedy and only explores a tiny fraction of the whole space (even with beam search) as opposed to dynamic programming. We show that, surprisingly, dynamic programming is in fact possible for many shift-reduce parsers, by merging “equivalent” stacks based on feature values. Empirically, our algorithm yields up to a five-fold speedup over a state-of-the-art shift-reduce depen- dency parser with no loss in accuracy. Better search also leads to better learning, and our final parser outperforms all previously reported dependency parsers for English and Chinese, yet is much faster.</p><p>6 0.14263827 <a title="83-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Hierarchical_Search_for_Word_Alignment.html">133 acl-2010-Hierarchical Search for Word Alignment</a></p>

<p>Author: Manabu Sassano ; Sadao Kurohashi</p><p>Abstract: We investigate active learning methods for Japanese dependency parsing. We propose active learning methods of using partial dependency relations in a given sentence for parsing and evaluate their effectiveness empirically. Furthermore, we utilize syntactic constraints of Japanese to obtain more labeled examples from precious labeled ones that annotators give. Experimental results show that our proposed methods improve considerably the learning curve of Japanese dependency parsing. In order to achieve an accuracy of over 88.3%, one of our methods requires only 34.4% of labeled examples as compared to passive learning.</p><p>6 0.73380095 <a title="83-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Bitext_Dependency_Parsing_with_Bilingual_Subtree_Constraints.html">52 acl-2010-Bitext Dependency Parsing with Bilingual Subtree Constraints</a></p>

<p>Author: Ashish Vaswani ; Adam Pauls ; David Chiang</p><p>Abstract: The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle is a method for model selection that trades off between the explanation of the data by the model and the complexity of the model itself. Inspired by the MDL principle, we develop an objective function for generative models that captures the description of the data by the model (log-likelihood) and the description of the model (model size). We also develop a efficient general search algorithm based on the MAP-EM framework to optimize this function. Since recent work has shown that minimizing the model size in a Hidden Markov Model for part-of-speech (POS) tagging leads to higher accuracies, we test our approach by applying it to this problem. The search algorithm involves a simple change to EM and achieves high POS tagging accuracies on both English and Italian data sets.</p><p>2 0.89263159 <a title="83-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Improving_Statistical_Machine_Translation_with_Monolingual_Collocation.html">147 acl-2010-Improving Statistical Machine Translation with Monolingual Collocation</a></p>

We make use of the collocation probabilities, which are estimated from monolingual corpora, in two aspects, namely improving word alignment for various kinds of SMT systems and improving phrase table for phrase-based SMT. The experimental results show that our method improves the performance of both word alignment and translation quality significantly. As compared to baseline systems, we achieve absolute improvements of 2.40 BLEU score on a phrase-based SMT system and 1.76 BLEU score on a parsing-based SMT system. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.87016362 <a title="83-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Dependency_Parsing_and_Projection_Based_on_Word-Pair_Classification.html">83 acl-2010-Dependency Parsing and Projection Based on Word-Pair Classification</a></p>

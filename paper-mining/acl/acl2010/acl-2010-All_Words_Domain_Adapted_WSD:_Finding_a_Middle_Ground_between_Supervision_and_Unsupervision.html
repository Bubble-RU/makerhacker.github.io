<p>Author: Zhi Zhong ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: Word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems based on supervised learning achieved the best performance in SensEval and SemEval workshops. However, there are few publicly available open source WSD systems. This limits the use of WSD in other applications, especially for researchers whose research interests are not in WSD. In this paper, we present IMS, a supervised English all-words WSD system. The flexible framework of IMS allows users to integrate different preprocessing tools, additional features, and different classifiers. By default, we use linear support vector machines as the classifier with multiple knowledge-based features. In our implementation, IMS achieves state-of-the-art results on several SensEval and SemEval tasks.</p><p>3 0.22196941 <a title="26-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Knowledge-Rich_Word_Sense_Disambiguation_Rivaling_Supervised_Systems.html">156 acl-2010-Knowledge-Rich Word Sense Disambiguation Rivaling Supervised Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Simone Paolo Ponzetto ; Roberto Navigli</p><p>Abstract: One of the main obstacles to highperformance Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the knowledge acquisition bottleneck. In this paper, we present a methodology to automatically extend WordNet with large amounts of semantic relations from an encyclopedic resource, namely Wikipedia. We show that, when provided with a vast amount of high-quality semantic relations, simple knowledge-lean disambiguation algorithms compete with state-of-the-art supervised WSD systems in a coarse-grained all-words setting and outperform them on gold-standard domain-specific datasets.</p><p>4 0.20468271 <a title="26-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Combining_Orthogonal_Monolingual_and_Multilingual_Sources_of_Evidence_for_All_Words_WSD.html">62 acl-2010-Combining Orthogonal Monolingual and Multilingual Sources of Evidence for All Words WSD</a></p>
<p>Author: Weiwei Guo ; Mona Diab</p><p>Abstract: Word Sense Disambiguation remains one ofthe most complex problems facing computational linguists to date. In this paper we present a system that combines evidence from a monolingual WSD system together with that from a multilingual WSD system to yield state of the art performance on standard All-Words data sets. The monolingual system is based on a modification ofthe graph based state ofthe art algorithm In-Degree. The multilingual system is an improvement over an AllWords unsupervised approach, SALAAM. SALAAM exploits multilingual evidence as a means of disambiguation. In this paper, we present modifications to both of the original approaches and then their combination. We finally report the highest results obtained to date on the SENSEVAL 2 standard data set using an unsupervised method, we achieve an overall F measure of 64.58 using a voting scheme.</p><p>5 0.19380622 <a title="26-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Topic_Models_for_Word_Sense_Disambiguation_and_Token-Based_Idiom_Detection.html">237 acl-2010-Topic Models for Word Sense Disambiguation and Token-Based Idiom Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Linlin Li ; Benjamin Roth ; Caroline Sporleder</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic model for sense disambiguation which chooses the best sense based on the conditional probability of sense paraphrases given a context. We use a topic model to decompose this conditional probability into two conditional probabilities with latent variables. We propose three different instantiations of the model for solving sense disambiguation problems with different degrees of resource availability. The proposed models are tested on three different tasks: coarse-grained word sense disambiguation, fine-grained word sense disambiguation, and detection of literal vs. nonliteral usages of potentially idiomatic expressions. In all three cases, we outper- form state-of-the-art systems either quantitatively or statistically significantly.</p><p>6 0.15840574 <a title="26-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-WSD_as_a_Distributed_Constraint_Optimization_Problem.html">257 acl-2010-WSD as a Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem</a></p>

<p>Author: Siva Reddy ; Abhilash Inumella</p><p>Abstract: This work models Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) problem as a Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP). To model WSD as a DCOP, we view information from various knowledge sources as constraints. DCOP algorithms have the remarkable property to jointly maximize over a wide range of utility functions associated with these constraints. We show how utility functions can be designed for various knowledge sources. For the purpose of evaluation, we modelled all words WSD as a simple DCOP problem. The results are competi- tive with state-of-art knowledge based systems.</p><p>4 0.81633353 <a title="26-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-It_Makes_Sense%3A_A_Wide-Coverage_Word_Sense_Disambiguation_System_for_Free_Text.html">152 acl-2010-It Makes Sense: A Wide-Coverage Word Sense Disambiguation System for Free Text</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiangyu Duan ; Min Zhang ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: The pipeline of most Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation (PB-SMT) systems starts from automatically word aligned parallel corpus. But word appears to be too fine-grained in some cases such as non-compositional phrasal equivalences, where no clear word alignments exist. Using words as inputs to PBSMT pipeline has inborn deficiency. This paper proposes pseudo-word as a new start point for PB-SMT pipeline. Pseudo-word is a kind of basic multi-word expression that characterizes minimal sequence of consecutive words in sense of translation. By casting pseudo-word searching problem into a parsing framework, we search for pseudo-words in a monolingual way and a bilingual synchronous way. Experiments show that pseudo-word significantly outperforms word for PB-SMT model in both travel translation domain and news translation domain. 1</p><p>3 0.62609607 <a title="26-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Latent_Variable_Models_of_Selectional_Preference.html">158 acl-2010-Latent Variable Models of Selectional Preference</a></p>
<p>Author: Diarmuid O Seaghdha</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes the application of so-called topic models to selectional preference induction. Three models related to Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a proven method for modelling document-word cooccurrences, are presented and evaluated on datasets of human plausibility judgements. Compared to previously proposed techniques, these models perform very competitively, especially for infrequent predicate-argument combinations where they exceed the quality of Web-scale predictions while using relatively little data.</p><p>4 0.58129656 <a title="26-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Knowledge-Rich_Word_Sense_Disambiguation_Rivaling_Supervised_Systems.html">156 acl-2010-Knowledge-Rich Word Sense Disambiguation Rivaling Supervised Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Simone Paolo Ponzetto ; Roberto Navigli</p><p>Abstract: One of the main obstacles to highperformance Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the knowledge acquisition bottleneck. In this paper, we present a methodology to automatically extend WordNet with large amounts of semantic relations from an encyclopedic resource, namely Wikipedia. We show that, when provided with a vast amount of high-quality semantic relations, simple knowledge-lean disambiguation algorithms compete with state-of-the-art supervised WSD systems in a coarse-grained all-words setting and outperform them on gold-standard domain-specific datasets.</p><p>5 0.56893921 <a title="26-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Automatic_Selectional_Preference_Acquisition_for_Latin_Verbs.html">41 acl-2010-Automatic Selectional Preference Acquisition for Latin Verbs</a></p>
<p>Author: Barbara McGillivray</p><p>Abstract: We present a system that automatically induces Selectional Preferences (SPs) for Latin verbs from two treebanks by using Latin WordNet. Our method overcomes some of the problems connected with data sparseness and the small size of the input corpora. We also suggest a way to evaluate the acquired SPs on unseen events extracted from other Latin corpora.</p><p>6 0.56294155 <a title="26-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Sentence_and_Expression_Level_Annotation_of_Opinions_in_User-Generated_Discourse.html">208 acl-2010-Sentence and Expression Level Annotation of Opinions in User-Generated Discourse</a></p>

<p>Author: Cigdem Toprak ; Niklas Jakob ; Iryna Gurevych</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a corpus of consumer reviews from the rateitall and the eopinions websites annotated with opinion-related information. We present a two-level annotation scheme. In the first stage, the reviews are analyzed at the sentence level for (i) relevancy to a given topic, and (ii) expressing an evaluation about the topic. In the second stage, on-topic sentences containing evaluations about the topic are further investigated at the expression level for pinpointing the properties (semantic orientation, intensity), and the functional components of the evaluations (opinion terms, targets and holders). We discuss the annotation scheme, the inter-annotator agreement for different subtasks and our observations.</p><p>3 0.16849278 <a title="157-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Automatically_Generating_Annotator_Rationales_to_Improve_Sentiment_Classification.html">42 acl-2010-Automatically Generating Annotator Rationales to Improve Sentiment Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Ainur Yessenalina ; Yejin Choi ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: One ofthe central challenges in sentimentbased text categorization is that not every portion of a document is equally informative for inferring the overall sentiment of the document. Previous research has shown that enriching the sentiment labels with human annotators’ “rationales” can produce substantial improvements in categorization performance (Zaidan et al., 2007). We explore methods to automatically generate annotator rationales for document-level sentiment classification.

<p>Author: Frank Keller</p><p>Abstract: We pose the development of cognitively plausible models of human language processing as a challenge for computational linguistics. Existing models can only deal with isolated phenomena (e.g., garden paths) on small, specifically selected data sets. The challenge is to build models that integrate multiple aspects of human language processing at the syntactic, semantic, and discourse level. Like human language processing, these models should be incremental, predictive, broad coverage, and robust to noise. This challenge can only be met if standardized data sets and evaluation measures are developed.</p><p>5 0.14673957 <a title="157-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Optimizing_Informativeness_and_Readability_for_Sentiment_Summarization.html">188 acl-2010-Optimizing Informativeness and Readability for Sentiment Summarization</a></p>
<p>Author: Hitoshi Nishikawa ; Takaaki Hasegawa ; Yoshihiro Matsuo ; Genichiro Kikui</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for sentiment summarization that takes account of informativeness and readability, simultaneously. Our algorithm generates a summary by selecting and ordering sentences taken from multiple review texts according to two scores that represent the informativeness and readability of the sentence order. The informativeness score is defined by the number of sentiment expressions and the readability score is learned from the target corpus. We evaluate our method by summarizing reviews on restaurants. Our method outperforms an existing algorithm as indicated by its ROUGE score and human readability experiments.</p><p>6 0.13059162 <a title="157-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Recommendation_in_Internet_Forums_and_Blogs.html">204 acl-2010-Recommendation in Internet Forums and Blogs</a></p>

<p>Author: Klinton Bicknell ; Roger Levy</p><p>Abstract: A number of results in the study of realtime sentence comprehension have been explained by computational models as resulting from the rational use of probabilistic linguistic information. Many times, these hypotheses have been tested in reading by linking predictions about relative word difficulty to word-aggregated eye tracking measures such as go-past time. In this paper, we extend these results by asking to what extent reading is well-modeled as rational behavior at a finer level of analysis, predicting not aggregate measures, but the duration and location of each fixation. We present a new rational model of eye movement control in reading, the central assumption of which is that eye move- ment decisions are made to obtain noisy visual information as the reader performs Bayesian inference on the identities of the words in the sentence. As a case study, we present two simulations demonstrating that the model gives a rational explanation for between-word regressions.</p><p>3 0.57440829 <a title="157-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-Automatically_Generating_Annotator_Rationales_to_Improve_Sentiment_Classification.html">42 acl-2010-Automatically Generating Annotator Rationales to Improve Sentiment Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Swati Tata ; Barbara Di Eugenio</p><p>Abstract: Music Recommendation Systems often recommend individual songs, as opposed to entire albums. The challenge is to generate reviews for each song, since only full album reviews are available on-line. We developed a summarizer that combines information extraction and generation techniques to produce summaries of reviews of individual songs. We present an intrinsic evaluation of the extraction components, and of the informativeness of the summaries; and a user study of the impact of the song review summaries on users’ decision making processes. Users were able to make quicker and more informed decisions when presented with the summary as compared to the full album review.</p><p>6 0.50745547 <a title="157-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-The_Influence_of_Discourse_on_Syntax%3A_A_Psycholinguistic_Model_of_Sentence_Processing.html">229 acl-2010-The Influence of Discourse on Syntax: A Psycholinguistic Model of Sentence Processing</a></p>

<p>Author: Ryu Iida ; Syumpei Kobayashi ; Takenobu Tokunaga</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an approach to reference resolution in situated dialogues by exploiting extra-linguistic information. Recently, investigations of referential behaviours involved in situations in the real world have received increasing attention by researchers (Di Eugenio et al., 2000; Byron, 2005; van Deemter, 2007; Spanger et al., 2009). In order to create an accurate reference resolution model, we need to handle extra-linguistic information as well as textual information examined by existing approaches (Soon et al., 2001 ; Ng and Cardie, 2002, etc.). In this paper, we incorporate extra-linguistic information into an existing corpus-based reference resolution model, and investigate its effects on refer- ence resolution problems within a corpus of Japanese dialogues. The results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves an accuracy of 79.0% for this task.</p><p>3 0.8207407 <a title="157-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-A_New_Approach_to_Improving_Multilingual_Summarization_Using_a_Genetic_Algorithm.html">11 acl-2010-A New Approach to Improving Multilingual Summarization Using a Genetic Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Marina Litvak ; Mark Last ; Menahem Friedman</p><p>Abstract: Automated summarization methods can be defined as “language-independent,” if they are not based on any languagespecific knowledge. Such methods can be used for multilingual summarization defined by Mani (2001) as “processing several languages, with summary in the same language as input.” In this paper, we introduce MUSE, a languageindependent approach for extractive summarization based on the linear optimization of several sentence ranking measures using a genetic algorithm. We tested our methodology on two languages—English and Hebrew—and evaluated its performance with ROUGE-1 Recall vs. state- of-the-art extractive summarization approaches. Our results show that MUSE performs better than the best known multilingual approach (TextRank1) in both languages. Moreover, our experimental results on a bilingual (English and Hebrew) document collection suggest that MUSE does not need to be retrained on each language and the same model can be used across at least two different languages.</p><p>4 0.74544728 <a title="157-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Learning_to_Translate_with_Source_and_Target_Syntax.html">169 acl-2010-Learning to Translate with Source and Target Syntax</a></p>
<p>Author: David Chiang</p><p>Abstract: Statistical translation models that try to capture the recursive structure of language have been widely adopted over the last few years. These models make use of varying amounts of information from linguistic theory: some use none at all, some use information about the grammar of the target language, some use information about the grammar of the source language. But progress has been slower on translation models that are able to learn the relationship between the grammars of both the source and target language. We discuss the reasons why this has been a challenge, review existing attempts to meet this challenge, and show how some old and new ideas can be combined into a sim- ple approach that uses both source and target syntax for significant improvements in translation accuracy.</p><p>5 0.63958246 <a title="157-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Experiments_in_Graph-Based_Semi-Supervised_Learning_Methods_for_Class-Instance_Acquisition.html">109 acl-2010-Experiments in Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning Methods for Class-Instance Acquisition</a></p>
<p>Author: Partha Pratim Talukdar ; Fernando Pereira</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms have been successfully used to extract class-instance pairs from large unstructured and structured text collections. However, a careful comparison of different graph-based SSL algorithms on that task has been lacking. We compare three graph-based SSL algorithms for class-instance acquisition on a variety of graphs constructed from different domains. We find that the recently proposed MAD algorithm is the most effective. We also show that class-instance extraction can be significantly improved by adding semantic information in the form of instance-attribute edges derived from an independently developed knowledge base. All of our code and data will be made publicly available to encourage reproducible research in this area.</p><p>6 0.58518612 <a title="157-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Generating_Fine-Grained_Reviews_of_Songs_from_Album_Reviews.html">122 acl-2010-Generating Fine-Grained Reviews of Songs from Album Reviews</a></p>

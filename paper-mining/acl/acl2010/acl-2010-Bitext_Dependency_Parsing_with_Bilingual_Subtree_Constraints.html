<p>Author: Min Zhang ; Hui Zhang ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a convolution forest kernel to effectively explore rich structured features embedded in a packed parse forest. As opposed to the convolution tree kernel, the proposed forest kernel does not have to commit to a single best parse tree, is thus able to explore very large object spaces and much more structured features embedded in a forest. This makes the proposed kernel more robust against parsing errors and data sparseness issues than the convolution tree kernel. The paper presents the formal definition of convolution forest kernel and also illustrates the computing algorithm to fast compute the proposed convolution forest kernel. Experimental results on two NLP applications, relation extraction and semantic role labeling, show that the proposed forest kernel significantly outperforms the baseline of the convolution tree kernel. 1</p><p>3 0.18310337 <a title="52-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Dependency_Parsing_and_Projection_Based_on_Word-Pair_Classification.html">83 acl-2010-Dependency Parsing and Projection Based on Word-Pair Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenbin Jiang ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we describe an intuitionistic method for dependency parsing, where a classifier is used to determine whether a pair of words forms a dependency edge. And we also propose an effective strategy for dependency projection, where the dependency relationships of the word pairs in the source language are projected to the word pairs of the target language, leading to a set of classification instances rather than a complete tree. Experiments show that, the classifier trained on the projected classification instances significantly outperforms previous projected dependency parsers. More importantly, when this clas- , sifier is integrated into a maximum spanning tree (MST) dependency parser, obvious improvement is obtained over the MST baseline.</p><p>4 0.15034012 <a title="52-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Filtering_Syntactic_Constraints_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">115 acl-2010-Filtering Syntactic Constraints for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Hailong Cao ; Eiichiro Sumita</p><p>Abstract: Source language parse trees offer very useful but imperfect reordering constraints for statistical machine translation. A lot of effort has been made for soft applications of syntactic constraints. We alternatively propose the selective use of syntactic constraints. A classifier is built automatically to decide whether a node in the parse trees should be used as a reordering constraint or not. Using this information yields a 0.8 BLEU point improvement over a full constraint-based system.</p><p>5 0.13928507 <a title="52-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Exploring_Syntactic_Structural_Features_for_Sub-Tree_Alignment_Using_Bilingual_Tree_Kernels.html">110 acl-2010-Exploring Syntactic Structural Features for Sub-Tree Alignment Using Bilingual Tree Kernels</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun Sun ; Min Zhang ; Chew Lim Tan</p><p>Abstract: We propose Bilingual Tree Kernels (BTKs) to capture the structural similarities across a pair of syntactic translational equivalences and apply BTKs to sub-tree alignment along with some plain features. Our study reveals that the structural features embedded in a bilingual parse tree pair are very effective for sub-tree alignment and the bilingual tree kernels can well capture such features. The experimental results show that our approach achieves a significant improvement on both gold standard tree bank and automatically parsed tree pairs against a heuristic similarity based method. We further apply the sub-tree alignment in machine translation with two methods. It is suggested that the subtree alignment benefits both phrase and syntax based systems by relaxing the constraint of the word alignment. 1</p><p>6 0.13282931 <a title="52-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Hierarchical_Search_for_Word_Alignment.html">133 acl-2010-Hierarchical Search for Word Alignment</a></p>

<p>Author: Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach to multilingual grammar induction that exploits a phylogeny-structured model of parameter drift. Our method does not require any translated texts or token-level alignments. Instead, the phylogenetic prior couples languages at a parameter level. Joint induction in the multilingual model substantially outperforms independent learning, with larger gains both from more articulated phylogenies and as well as from increasing numbers of languages. Across eight languages, the multilingual approach gives error reductions over the standard monolingual DMV averaging 21. 1% and reaching as high as 39%.</p><p>6 0.516572 <a title="52-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Efficient_Third-Order_Dependency_Parsers.html">99 acl-2010-Efficient Third-Order Dependency Parsers</a></p>

<p>Author: Andres Osvaldo Porta</p><p>Abstract: The aim of this work is to present some preliminary results of an investigation in course on the typology of the morphology of the native South American languages from the point of view of the formal language theory. With this object, we give two contrasting examples of descriptions of two Aboriginal languages finite verb forms morphology: Argentinean Quechua (quichua santiague n˜o) and Toba. The description of the morphology of the finite verb forms of Argentinean quechua, uses finite automata and finite transducers. In this case the construction is straightforward using two level morphology and then, describes in a very natural way the Argentinean Quechua morphology using a regular language. On the contrary, the Toba verbs morphology, with a system that simultaneously uses prefixes and suffixes, has not a natural description as regular language. Toba has a complex system of causative suffixes, whose successive applications determinate the use of prefixes belonging different person marking prefix sets. We adopt the solution of Creider et al. (1995) to naturally deal with this and other similar morphological processes which involve interactions between prefixes and suffixes and then we describe the toba morphology using linear context-free languages.1 .</p><p>4 0.71606708 <a title="52-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Efficient_Third-Order_Dependency_Parsers.html">99 acl-2010-Efficient Third-Order Dependency Parsers</a></p>
<p>Author: Terry Koo ; Michael Collins</p><p>Abstract: We present algorithms for higher-order dependency parsing that are “third-order” in the sense that they can evaluate substructures containing three dependencies, and “efficient” in the sense that they require only O(n4) time. Importantly, our new parsers can utilize both sibling-style and grandchild-style interactions. We evaluate our parsers on the Penn Treebank and Prague Dependency Treebank, achieving unlabeled attachment scores of 93.04% and 87.38%, respectively.</p><p>5 0.71503025 <a title="52-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Dynamic_Programming_for_Linear-Time_Incremental_Parsing.html">93 acl-2010-Dynamic Programming for Linear-Time Incremental Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Liang Huang ; Kenji Sagae</p><p>Abstract: Incremental parsing techniques such as shift-reduce have gained popularity thanks to their efficiency, but there remains a major problem: the search is greedy and only explores a tiny fraction of the whole space (even with beam search) as opposed to dynamic programming. We show that, surprisingly, dynamic programming is in fact possible for many shift-reduce parsers, by merging “equivalent” stacks based on feature values. Empirically, our algorithm yields up to a five-fold speedup over a state-of-the-art shift-reduce depen- dency parser with no loss in accuracy. Better search also leads to better learning, and our final parser outperforms all previously reported dependency parsers for English and Chinese, yet is much faster.</p><p>6 0.71090394 <a title="52-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Diversify_and_Combine%3A_Improving_Word_Alignment_for_Machine_Translation_on_Low-Resource_Languages.html">90 acl-2010-Diversify and Combine: Improving Word Alignment for Machine Translation on Low-Resource Languages</a></p>

[sent-5, score-0.256]
</p><p>2 The maximum number f of tuple components that can be generated by an LCFRS G is called the fan-out of G, and the maximum number r of nonterminals in the right-hand side of a production is called the rank of G. [sent-12, score-0.274]
</p><p>3 Nonetheless, in natural language parsing applications, it is possible to  achieve efficient, polynomial parsing if we succeed in reducing the rank r (number of nonterminals in the right-hand side) of individual LCFRSs’ productions (Kuhlmann and Satta, 2009). [sent-20, score-0.249]
</p><p>4 Production factorization is very similar to the reduction of a context-free grammar production into Chomsky normal form. [sent-22, score-0.307]
</p><p>5 However, in the LCFRS case some productions might not be reducible to r = 2, and the process stops at some larger value for r, which in the worst case might as well be the rank of the source production (Rambow and Satta, 1999). [sent-23, score-0.303]
</p><p>6 Through these equivalence results, we can transfer the factorization techniques presented in this article to other finite copying parallel rewriting systems. [sent-36, score-0.301]
</p><p>7 ·T×h(eΣ idea underlying the rewriting relation associated with LCFRS is that production p applies to any sequence of string tuples generated by the Bi’s, and provides a new string tuple in obtained through function g. [sent-74, score-0.355]
</p><p>8 1 However, the polynomial degree in the running time is a monotonically strictly increasing function that depends on both the rank and the fan-out of the productions in the grammar. [sent-83, score-0.197]
</p><p>9 Note that productions p1 and p2 have rank strictly smaller than the source production p. [sent-143, score-0.303]
</p><p>10 Example 2 Let us consider the following production with rank 4:  iPt i f=s0 p  A  gS(B, C, D, E), gA(hx11, x12i, hx21, x22i, hx31, x32i, hx41, x42i) hx11x21x31x41x12x42, x22x32i. [sent-146, score-0.197]
</p><p>11 2  The factorization procedure above should be applied to all productions of a LCFRS with rank larger than two. [sent-148, score-0.315]
</p><p>12 One important difference is that, while production factorization into binary form is always possible in the contextfree case, for LCFRS there are worst case grammars in which rank reduction is not possible at all, as shown in (Rambow and Satta, 1999). [sent-153, score-0.401]
</p><p>13 3  A graph-based representation for LCFRS productions  Rather than factorizing LCFRS productions directly, in this article we work with a more abstract representation of productions based on graphs. [sent-154, score-0.358]
</p><p>14 The p-graph associated with production p is a triple (Vp, Ep, ≺p) such that  =  • Vp {xij | 1 ≤ i ≤ ρ(p), ϕ(Bi) j ≤ ϕ(Bi)} 1is ≤ a s ie t≤ ≤o fρ v(pe)r,tic ϕe(s;B2 j  ≤  = 2,  1≤  ϕ(B  2Here we are overloading symbols xij . [sent-181, score-0.256]
</p><p>15 Circled sets of edges indicate the factorization in that example. [sent-187, score-0.216]
</p><p>16 A set of edges E ⊆ Ep is called a bundle with fanA-o suett one difg V (E) = [x1, x2] for some x1, x2 ∈ Vp, i. [sent-205, score-0.601]
</p><p>17 Note tha∈t ∈if V E is a bundle with fan-out two with V (E) = [x1, x2] ∪ [x3 , x4], then neither E([x1 , x2]) nor E([x3, x4]) are bundles with fanout one, since there is at least one edge incident upon a vertex in [x1, x2] and a vertex in [x3, x4] . [sent-209, score-1.257]
</p><p>18 We also use the term bundle to denote a bundle with fan-out either one or two. [sent-210, score-1.056]
</p><p>19 Intuitively, in a p-graph associated with a LCFRS production p, a bundle E with fan-out f and with |E| > 1identifies a set of nonterminals aCn idn wthieth right-hand sdiednet of p tah aset can n beo nftaecrtmorinizaelds iCn iton a new production. [sent-211, score-0.761]
</p><p>20 Our factorization algorithm is based on efficient methods for the detection of bundles with fan-out one and two. [sent-213, score-0.546]
</p><p>21 4  The algorithm  In this section we provide an efficient, recursive algorithm for the decomposition of a p-graph into bundles, which corresponds to factorizing the rep-  resented LCFRS production. [sent-214, score-0.284]
</p><p>22 We want to compute an optimal hierarchical decomposition of an input bundle with fan-out 1 or 2. [sent-217, score-0.864]
</p><p>23 This decomposition can be represented by a tree, in which each node N corresponds to a bundle (the root node corresponds to the input bundle) and the daughters of N represent the bundles in which N is immediately decomposed. [sent-218, score-1.175]
</p><p>24 The decomposition is optimal in so far as the maximum arity of the decomposition tree is as small as possible. [sent-219, score-0.58]
</p><p>25 As already explained above, this decomposition represents a factorization of some production p of a LCFRS, resulting in optimal rank reduction. [sent-220, score-0.676]
</p><p>26 All the internal nodes in the decomposition represent fresh nonterminals that will be created during the factorization process. [sent-221, score-0.464]
</p><p>27 The construction of the decomposition tree is carried out recursively. [sent-222, score-0.244]
</p><p>28 For a given bundle with fan-out 1 or 2, we apply a procedure for decom-  posing this bundle in its immediate sub-bundles with fan-out 1 or 2, in an optimal way. [sent-223, score-1.172]
</p><p>29 Recursion stops when we reach bundles containing only one edge (which correspond to the nonterminals in the right-hand side of the input production). [sent-225, score-0.512]
</p><p>30 The procedure for computing an optimal decomposition of a bundle F into its immediate subbundles, which we describe in the first part of this section, can be sketched as follows. [sent-227, score-0.888]
</p><p>31 First, we identify and temporarily remove all maximal bundles with fan-out 1 (Section 4. [sent-228, score-0.403]
</p><p>32 The result is a new bundle F′ which is a subset of the original bundle, and has the same fan-out. [sent-230, score-0.528]
</p><p>33 We compute the optimal decomposition of F′, resting on the hypothesis that there are no sub-bundles with fan-out 1. [sent-233, score-0.336]
</p><p>34 This results in a “first level” decomposition ofthe original bundle F. [sent-235, score-0.772]
</p><p>35 We then recursively decompose all individual sub-bundles of F, including the bundles with fan-out 1that have been later attached. [sent-236, score-0.435]
</p><p>36 left is the leftmost vertex among all those vertices in r that are connected to some vertex to the left of r. [sent-283, score-0.296]
</p><p>37 We process ranges in increasing order of size, expanding each range r by one unit at a time by adding a new vertex at its right. [sent-302, score-0.255]
</p><p>38 Backward and local backward quantities for the expanded range can be expressed as a function of the same quantities for r. [sent-303, score-0.32]
</p><p>39 Therefore if we store our quantities for previously pro-  cessed ranges, each new range can be annotated with the desired quantities in constant time. [sent-304, score-0.259]
</p><p>40 3  Bundles with fan-out one  The detection of bundles with fan-out 1within the p-graph can be easily performed in O(n2), where n gisr tahpeh n cuamnb beer oeafs siitlsy yv peretrifcoerms. [sent-317, score-0.403]
</p><p>41 Indeed, (thne incident set E(r) of a range r is a bundle with fan-out one if and only if r. [sent-318, score-0.615]
</p><p>42 We now remove from F all bundles with fan-out  1from the original bundle F. [sent-331, score-0.931]
</p><p>43 The result is the new bundle F′, that has no sub-bundles with fan-out 1. [sent-332, score-0.528]
</p><p>44 4  Bundles with fan-out two  Efficient detection of bundles with fan-out two in F′ is considerably more challenging. [sent-334, score-0.403]
</p><p>45 A direct generalization of the technique proposed for detecting bundles with fan-out 1 would use the following property, that is also a direct corollary of the definitions in Section 4. [sent-335, score-0.403]
</p><p>46 We now have all the pieces to extract bundles with fan-out 2 in time O(n2). [sent-373, score-0.428]
</p><p>47 nIfs tita ndto etsimne’t, r hise nheotr  the first part of a valid bundle with fan-out 2, and we move on to the next range r. [sent-383, score-0.586]
</p><p>48 If it is, we output the valid bundle (r, r′′) and move on to the next element in T(r′). [sent-388, score-0.528]
</p><p>49 Indeed, in case of a failure, the backward edge that relates a vertex in r′′ with a vertex outside r will still be included in all further elements in T(r′) since T(r′) is ordered by increasing left boundary. [sent-389, score-0.339]
</p><p>50 This algorithm spends a constant time on each range plus a constant time on each bundle with fan-out 2. [sent-391, score-0.698]
</p><p>51 We shall prove in Section 5 that there are O(n2) bundles with fan-out 2. [sent-392, score-0.461]
</p><p>52 Now that we have extracted all bundles, we  need to extract an optimal decomposition ofthe input bundle F′, i. [sent-394, score-0.864]
</p><p>53 , a minimal size partition of all n elements (edges) in the input bundle such that each of these partition is a bundle (with fan-out 2, since bundles with fan-out 1 are excluded, except for the input bundle). [sent-396, score-1.543]
</p><p>54 5 Extracting an optimal decomposition We have constructed the set of all (fan-out 2) subbundles of F′. [sent-399, score-0.363]
</p><p>55 We now need to build one optimal decomposition of F′ into sub-bundles. [sent-400, score-0.336]
</p><p>56 Theorem 1 For any bundle E, either it has at  least one binary decomposition, or all its decompositions are refinements of a unique optimal one. [sent-406, score-0.712]
</p><p>57 By definition, all bundles of the form E[kl−1,kl] (p ≤ l ≤ q) have a non-empty intersection with (atp le ≤as lt one ) bu hnavdele a ao nfo thne-e mforpmty E[k′,k′l]  =  3The term “refinement” is used in the usual way concerning partitions, i. [sent-419, score-0.435]
</p><p>58 Applying lL ≤emm qa 1, this shows that E([kp+1 , kq]) is a bundle with fan-out 2. [sent-424, score-0.528]
</p><p>59 Therefore, by replacing all ranges involved in this union in one decomposition or the other, we get a third decomposition for which the two initial ones are strict refinements. [sent-425, score-0.541]
</p><p>60 There exist no range r′′ ⊂ r such that (i) Er′′ is a bundle and (ii) ∃l, 1≤ l ≤ m usuchch th thaat t( [kl , kl+1] ⊂ r′′. [sent-433, score-0.586]
</p><p>61 The union of r′′ and of the ranges in the optimal decomposition that have a non-empty intersection with r′′ is a fan-out 2 bundle that includes at least two elements of the opti-  mal decomposition, but that is strictly included in E because the decomposition is not binary. [sent-435, score-1.161]
</p><p>62 We suppose it has a binary (optimal) decomposition (not necessarily unique). [sent-439, score-0.303]
</p><p>63 Then E(r′′) and E( [k + 1, j] ) form a binary decomposition of E. [sent-441, score-0.272]
</p><p>64 Each (optimal) binary decomposition of E decomposes r in 1, 2 or 3 sub-ranges. [sent-443, score-0.314]
</p><p>65 If no optimal decomposition decomposes r in at least 2 subranges, then the proof given here can be adapted by reasoning on r′ instead of r. [sent-444, score-0.44]
</p><p>66 We select one of these optimal decomposition by taking one such that k1 is maximal. [sent-447, score-0.336]
</p><p>67 First, let us suppose that r is decomposed  into two sub-ranges [i, k1] and [k1 + 1, j] by the selected optimal decomposition. [sent-449, score-0.217]
</p><p>68 Which means that E(r′′) and E(r′′′) form a binary decomposition of E. [sent-461, score-0.295]
</p><p>69 Second, let us suppose that r is decomposed into 3 sub-ranges by the selected original decomposition (therefore, r′ is not decomposed by this  decomposition). [sent-463, score-0.403]
</p><p>70 This means that this decomposition involves a bundle with a cover of the form [i, k1] ∪ [k2 + 1, j] and another bundle with a cover of the] ∪fo[rkm [k1 + 1, k2] ∪ r′ (this bundle is in fact E(r′)). [sent-464, score-1.943]
</p><p>71 t Ihfe k original decomposition are included in r′′, which means that E(r′′) = E, and therefore r′′ = r which is excluded. [sent-466, score-0.267]
</p><p>72 Hence, E(r′′) can not be a crossing bundle without having a left component that is [i, j], which is excluded (it would mean E(r′′) = E). [sent-470, score-0.565]
</p><p>73 This means that E(r′′) is a bundle with a cover of the form [i, k] ∪ [k′ + 1, j] . [sent-471, score-0.597]
</p><p>74 Which means tohfat t E(r′) mis iin, f]ac ∪t [thke bundle whose cover is [k + 1, k′ + 1] ∪ r′. [sent-472, score-0.597]
</p><p>75 Hence, E(r′′) and E(r′) form a binary decomposition of E. [sent-473, score-0.272]
</p><p>76 As an immediate consequence  of Lemmas 2  and 3, our algorithm for extracting the optimal decomposition for F′ consists in applying the following procedure recursively, starting with F′, and repeating it on each constructed sub-bundle E, until sub-bundles with only one edge are reached. [sent-476, score-0.392]
</p><p>77 One optimal decomposition of E can be obtained as follows. [sent-478, score-0.336]
</p><p>78 One selects the bundle with a left component starting in iand with the maximum length, and iterating this selection process until r is covered. [sent-479, score-0.55]
</p><p>79 Note that this 531  decomposition is unique if and only if it has four components or more; it can not be ternary; it may be binary, and in this case it may be non-unique. [sent-482, score-0.268]
</p><p>80 This algorithm gives us a way to extract an optimal decomposition of F′ in linear time w. [sent-483, score-0.384]

</p><p>84 6 The main decomposition algorithm We now have to generalize our algorithm in order to handle the possible existence of fan-out 1 bundles. [sent-496, score-0.244]
</p><p>85 First, we extract and remove (maximal) bundles with fan-out 1 from F, and recursively apply to each of them the complete algorithm. [sent-498, score-0.435]
</p><p>86 What remains is F′, which is a set of bundles with no sub-bundles with fan-out 1. [sent-499, score-0.403]
</p><p>87 Then, for each bundle with fan-out 1, we group it with a randomly chosen adjacent bundle with fan-out 2, which builds an expanded bundle  with fan-out 2, which has a binary decomposition into the original bundle with fan-out 2 and the bundle with fan-out 1. [sent-501, score-2.912]
</p><p>88 Let us compute an upper bound on the number of bundles with fan-out two that can be found within the p-graph processed in Section 4. [sent-504, score-0.403]

We give a detailed description of algorithms for application of cascades of weighted tree transducers to weighted tree acceptors, connecting formal theory with actual practice. Additionally, we present novel on-the-fly variants of these algorithms, and compare their performance on a syntax machine translation cascade based on (Yamada and Knight, 2001). 1 Motivation Weighted finite-state transducers have found recent favor as models of natural language (Mohri, 1997). In order to make actual use of systems built with these formalisms we must first calculate the set of possible weighted outputs allowed by the transducer given some input, which we call forward application, or the set of possible weighted inputs given some output, which we call backward application. After application we can do some inference on this result, such as determining its k highest weighted elements. We may also want to divide up our problems into manageable chunks, each represented by a transducer. As noted by Woods (1980), it is easier for designers to write several small transducers where each performs a simple transformation, rather than painstakingly construct a single complicated device. We would like to know, then, the result of transformation of input or output by a cascade of transducers, one operating after the other. As we will see, there are various strategies for approaching this problem. We will consider offline composition, bucket brigade applica- tion, and on-the-fly application. Application of cascades of weighted string transducers (WSTs) has been well-studied (Mohri, Heiko Vogler Technische Universit a¨t Dresden Institut f u¨r Theoretische Informatik 01062 Dresden, Germany he iko .vogle r@ tu-dre s den .de 1997). Less well-studied but of more recent interest is application of cascades of weighted tree transducers (WTTs). We tackle application of WTT cascades in this work, presenting: • • • explicit algorithms for application of WTT casceaxpdelisc novel algorithms for on-the-fly application of nWoTvTe lca alscgoardieths,m mansd f experiments comparing the performance of tehxepseer iamlgeonrtisthm cos.m 2 Strategies for the string case Before we discuss application of WTTs, it is helpful to recall the solution to this problem in the WST domain. We recall previous formal presentations of WSTs (Mohri, 1997) and note informally that they may be represented as directed graphs with designated start and end states and edges labeled with input symbols, output symbols, and weights.1 Fortunately, the solution for WSTs is practically trivial—we achieve application through a series of embedding, composition, and projection operations. Embedding is simply the act of representing a string or regular string language as an identity WST. Composition of WSTs, that is, generating a single WST that captures the transformations of two input WSTs used in sequence, is not at all trivial, but has been well covered in, e.g., (Mohri, 2009), where directly implementable algorithms can be found. Finally, projection is another trivial operation—the domain or range language can be obtained from a WST by ignoring the output or input symbols, respectively, on its arcs, and summing weights on otherwise identical arcs. By embedding an input, composing the result with the given WST, and projecting the result, forward application is accomplished.2 We are then left with a weighted string acceptor (WSA), essentially a weighted, labeled graph, which can be traversed R+1∪W {e+ as∞su}m,te ha thtro thuegh woeuitgh t hi osf p aa ppaetrh t ihsa cta wlceuilgahtetds a asre th ien prod∪uct { +of∞ ∞th}e, wtheaitgh thtes wofe i gtsh etd ogfes a, panatdh t ihsat c athlceu lwateeigdh ats so tfh ae (not necessarily finite) set T of paths is calculated as the sum of the weights of the paths of T. 2For backward applications, the roles of input and output are simply exchanged. 1058 ProceedingUsp opfs thaela 4, 8Stwhe Adnennu,a 1l1- M16ee Jtiunlgy o 2f0 t1h0e.

Because WSTs can be freely composed, extending application to operate on a cascade of WSTs is fairly trivial. The only question is one of composition order: whether to initially compose the cascade into a single transducer (an approach we call offline composition) or to compose the initial embedding with the first transducer, trim useless states, compose the result with the second, and so on (an approach we call bucket brigade). The appropriate strategy generally depends on the structure of the individual transducers. A third approach builds the result incrementally, as dictated by some algorithm that requests information about it. Such an approach, which we call on-the-fly, was described in (Pereira and Riley, 1997; Mohri, 2009; Mohri et al., 2000). If we can efficiently calculate the outgoing edges of a state of the result WSA on demand, without calculating all edges in the entire machine, we can maintain a stand-in for the result structure, a machine consisting at first of only the start state of the true result. As a calling algorithm (e.g., an implementation of Dijkstra’s algorithm) requests information about the result graph, such as the set of outgoing edges from a state, we replace the current stand-in with a richer version by adding the result of the request. The on-the-fly approach has a distinct advantage over the other two methods in that the entire result graph need not be built. A graphical representation of all three methods is presented in Figure 1. 3 AppCliEcdcF//a..53ti64on of treeB tFranscd/d./3.u264cers Now let us revisit these strategies in the setting of trees and tree transducers. Imagine we have a tree or set of trees as input that can be represented as a weighted regular tree grammar3 (WRTG) and a WTT that can transform that input with some weight. We would like to know the k-best trees the WTT can produce as output for that input, along with their weights. We already know of several methods for acquiring k-best trees from a WRTG (Huang and Chiang, 2005; Pauls and Klein, 2009), so we then must ask if, analogously to the string case, WTTs preserve recognizability4 and we can form an application WRTG. Before we begin, however, we must define WTTs and WRTGs. 3.1 Preliminaries5 A ranked alphabet is a finite set Σ such that every member σ ∈ Σ has a rank rk(σ) ∈ N.

We explicitly allow such summations. A WRTG G is in normal form if each production is either a chain production or is of the form n σ(n1, . . . , nk) where σ ∈ Σ(k) and n1, . . . , nk →∈ σ N(n.

Table 1 presents known results for the top-down tree transducer classes described in Section 3. 1. Unlike the string case, preservation of recognizability is not universal or symmetric. This is important for us, because we can only construct an application WRTG, i.e., a WRTG representing the result of application, if we can ensure that the language generated by application is in fact recognizable. Of the types under consideration, only wxLNT and wLNT preserve forward recognizability. The two classes marked as open questions and the other classes, which are superclasses of wNT, do not or are presumed not to. All subclasses of wxLT preserve backward recognizability.7 We do not consider cases where recognizability is not preserved tshuamt in the remainder of this paper. If a transducer M of a class that preserves forward recognizability is applied to a WRTG G, we can call the forward ap7Note that the introduction of weights limits recognizability preservation considerably. For example, (unweighted) xT preserves backward recognizability. plication WRTG M(G). and if M preserves backward recognizability, we can call the backward application WRTG M(G)/. Now that we have explained the application problem in the context of weighted tree transducers and determined the classes for which application is possible, let us consider how to build forward and backward application WRTGs. Our basic approach mimics that taken for WSTs by using an embed-compose-project strategy. As in string world, if we can embed the input in a transducer, compose with the given transducer, and project the result, we can obtain the application WRTG. Embedding a WRTG in a wLNT is a trivial operation—if the WRTG is in normal form and chain production-free,8 for every production of the form n − →w σ(n1 , . . . , nk), create a rule ofthe form n.σ(x1 , . . . , xk) − →w σ(n1 .x1, . . . , nk.xk). Range × projection of a w− x→LN σT(n is also trivial—for every q ∈ Q and u ∈ T∆ (Q X) create a production of the form q ∈−→w T u(0 where )u 0c is formed from u by replacing al−l → →lea uves of the form q.x with the leaf q, i.e., removing references to variables, and w is the sum of the weights of all rules of the form q.y → u in R.9 Domain projection for wxLT is bq.eyst →exp ulai inne dR b.y way of example. The left side of a rule is preserved, with variables leaves replaced by their associated states from the right side. So, the rule q1.σ(γ(x1) , x2) − →w δ(q2.x2, β(α, q3.x1)) would yield the production q1 q− →w σ(γ(q3) , q2) in the domain projection. Howev− →er, aσ dγe(lqeting rule such as q1.σ(x1 , x2) − →w γ(q2.x2) necessitates the introduction of a new →non γte(rqminal ⊥ that can genienrtartoed aullc toiof nT Σo fw ai nthe wwe niognhtte r1m . The only missing piece in our embed-composeproject strategy is composition. Algorithm 1, which is based on the declarative construction of Maletti (2006), generates the syntactic composition of a wxLT and a wLNT, a generalization of the basic composition construction of Baker (1979). It calls Algorithm 2, which determines the sequences of rules in the second transducer that match the right side of a single rule in the × first transducer. Since the embedded WRTG is of type wLNT, it may be either the first or second argument provided to Algorithm 1, depending on whether the application is forward or backward. We can thus use the embed-compose-project strategy for forward application of wLNT and backward application of wxLT and wxLNT. Note that we cannot use this strategy for forward applica8Without loss of generality we assume this is so, since standard algorithms exist to remove chain productions (Kuich, 1998; E´sik and Kuich, 2003; Mohri, 2009) and convert into normal form (Alexandrakis and Bozapalidis, 1987). 9Finitely many such productions may be formed. 1061 tion of wxLNT, even though that class preserves recognizability.

We will revisit the three strategies for accomplishing application discussed above for the string case. In order for offline composition to be a viable strategy, the transducers in the cascade must be closed under composition. Unfortunately, of the classes that preserve recognizability, only wLNT × is closed under composition (G´ ecseg and Steinby, 1984; Baker, 1979; Maletti et al., 2009; F ¨ul ¨op and Vogler, 2009). However, the general lack of composability of tree transducers does not preclude us from conducting forward application of a cascade. We revisit the bucket brigade approach, which in Section 2 appeared to be little more than a choice of composition order. As discussed previously, application of a single transducer involves an embedding, a composition, and a projection. The embedded WRTG is in the class wLNT, and the projection forms another WRTG. As long as every transducer in the cascade can be composed with a wLNT to its left or right, depending on the application type, application of a cascade is possible. Note that this embed-compose-project process is somewhat more burdensome than in the string case. For strings, application is obtained by a single embedding, a series of compositions, and a single projecAlgorithm 2 COVER 1: inputs 2: u ∈ T∆ (Q1 X) 3: wuT ∈ M T2 = (Q×2, X X∆), Γ, R2, q20 ) 4: state q2 ∈ Q2 ×× × 5: outputs 6: set of pairs (z, w) with z ∈ TΓ ((Q1 Q2) X) fsoetrm ofed p ab yir so (nze, ,o wr m) worieth hsu zcc ∈es Tsful runs× ×on Q Qu )b y × ×ru Xles) in R2, starting from q2, and w ∈ R+∞ the sum of the weights of all such runs,. 7: complexity 8: O(|R2|size(u)) 9: 10: 11: 12: 13: 14: if u(ε) is of the form (q1,x) ∈ Q1× X then zinit ← ((q1 q2), x) else zinit ← ⊥ Πlast ←← ←{(z ⊥init, {((ε, ε), q2)}, 1)} for all← v ∈ pos(u) εsu,εch), tqha)t} u(v) ∈ ∆(k) for some fko ≥r 0ll li nv p ∈ref ipxo osr(ude)r sduoc 15: ≥Π v0 i←n p ∅r 16: for ←all ∅(z, θ, w) ∈ Πlast do 17: rf aorll a(zll, vθ0, ∈w )lv ∈(z Π) such that z(v0) = ⊥ do 18: 19: 20: 21: 22: 23: 24: 25: 26: 27: 28: , dfoor all(θ(v,v0).u(v)(x1,...,xk) −w →0h)∈R2 θ0 ← θ For←m sθubstitution mapping ϕ : (Q2 X) → TΓ((Q1 Q2 X) {⊥}). f→or Ti = 1to× ×k dQo for all v00 ∈ pos(h) such that h(v00) = (q02 , xi∈) for some q20 ∈ Q2 do θ0(vi, v0v00) ← q20 if u(vi) ←is q of the form (q1, x) ∈ Q1 X then ∪ ,ϕ(x)q20 ∈, x Qi) ←× X((q t1h, eqn20), x) else ϕ(q20, xi) ← ⊥ Πv ← Πv {(z[ϕ)( ←h)] ⊥v0 , θ0, w · w0)} ∪ 29: Πlast ← Πv 30: Z ← {z |← ←(z Π, θ, Xw) 31: return {(z, X ∈ (z ,θ ,wX) X∈Πl Πlast} w) | z ∈ Z} ast X tion, whereas application for trees is obtained by a series of (embed, compose, project) operations. 4.1 On-the-fly algorithms We next consider on-the-fly algorithms for application. Similar to the string case, an on-thefly approach is driven by a calling algorithm that periodically needs to know the productions in a WRTG with a common left side nonterminal. The embed-compose-project approach produces an entire application WRTG before any inference algorithm is run. In order to admit an on-the-fly approach we describe algorithms that only generate those productions in a WRTG that have a given left nonterminal. In this section we extend Definition 3. 1 as follows: a WRTG is a 6tuple G = (N, P, n0,M,G) where N, P, and n0 are defined as in Definition 3. 1, and either M = G = ∅,10 or M is a wxLNT and G is a normMal = =fo Grm =, c ∅h,ain production-free WRTG such that Σ, 10In which case Σ, the definition is functionally unchanged from before. 1062 w t[xLypN] LeT (a)pPresOYNer Qovsateiodn?f(Grwe´ca(Fsd¨uMrg(lKeS¨coa punelgsid cowtihuSza,[rtxlbce1.2i]9,l0Nn2tybT091), 984w [txy](pbL Ne)T PrespvatiosYnNero svfebda?ckw(rFdu¨MlSeo¨c apesgl onwtiuza[r,xlcb.2]ei,NlL0t2yT 91)0 Table 1: Preservation of forward and backward recognizability for various classes of top-down tree transducers.

Note that because we used this on-the-fly approach, we were able to avoid building all the productions in MA(G).; in particular we did not build g0a2 − −w2 −· −w →8 ρ, while a bucket brigade approach would −h −a −v −e → →bui ρlt, ,t whish production. We have also designed an analogous onthe-fly PRODUCE algorithm for backward application on linear WTT. We have now defined several on-the-fly and bucket brigade algorithms, and also discussed the possibility of embed-compose-project and offline composition strategies to application of cascades of tree transducers. Tables 2a and 2b summarize the available methods of forward and backward application of cascades for recognizabilitypreserving tree transducer classes. 5 Decoding Experiments The main purpose of this paper has been to present novel algorithms for performing applica- tion. However, it is important to demonstrate these algorithms on real data. We thus demonstrate bucket-brigade and on-the-fly backward application on a typical NLP task cast as a cascade of wLNT. We adapt the Japanese-to-English transla13Note that G2 is the initial stand-in for MB (MA (G).)., since G1 is the initial stand-in for MA (G).. 1064 obomcbtfethodW√ √STwx√L× NTwL√ √NTo mbctbfethodW√ √STw×x√ LTw√ ×LTwxL√ ×NTwL√ √NT (a) Forward application (b) Backward application Table 2: Transducer types and available methods of forward and backward application of a cascade. oc = offline composition, bb = bucket brigade, otf = on the fly. tion model of Yamada and Knight (2001) by transforming it from an English-tree-to-Japanese-string model to an English-tree-to-Japanese-tree model. The Japanese trees are unlabeled, meaning they have syntactic structure but all nodes are labeled “X”. We then cast this modified model as a cascade of LNT tree transducers. Space does not permit a detailed description, but some example rules are in Figure 3. The rotation transducer R, a samparlee ionf Fwighuicreh 3is.

We add an English syntax language model L to theW ceas acdadde a no Ef ntrgalinsshd uscyentras x ju lastn gdueascgrei mbeodd etol L be ttoter simulate an actual machine translation decoding task. The language model is cast as an identity WTT and thus fits naturally into the experimental framework. In our experiments we try several different language models to demonstrate varying performance of the application algorithms. The most realistic language model is a PCFG. Each rule captures the probability of a particular sequence of child labels given a parent label. This model has 7,765 rules. To demonstrate more extreme cases of the usefulness of the on-the-fly approach, we build a language model that recognizes exactly the 2,087 trees in the training corpus, each with equal weight. It has 39,455 rules. Finally, to be ultraspecific, we include a form of the “specific” language model just described, but only allow the English counterpart of the particular Japanese sentence being decoded in the language.

We evaluate the speed of each approach: bucket brigade and on-the-fly. The algorithm we use to obtain the 1-best path is a modification of the kbest algorithm of Pauls and Klein (2009). Our algorithm finds the 1-best path in a WRTG and admits an on-the-fly approach. The results of the experiments are shown in Table 3. As can be seen, on-the-fly application is generally faster than the bucket brigade, about double the speed per sentence in the traditional L1eMp-xcsafe tgcyn tpemb u eo ct hkfoe tdime>/.21s 0.e78465nms tenc Table 3: Timing results to obtain 1-best from application through a weighted tree transducer cascade, using on-the-fly vs. bucket brigade backward application techniques. pcfg = model recognizes any tree licensed by a pcfg built from observed data, exact = model recognizes each of 2,000+ trees with equal weight, 1-sent = model recognizes exactly one tree. experiment that uses an English PCFG language model. The results for the other two language models demonstrate more keenly the potential advantage that an on-the-fly approach provides—the simultaneous incorporation of information from all models allows application to be done more effectively than if each information source is considered in sequence. In the “exact” case, where a very large language model that simply recognizes each of the 2,087 trees in the training corpus is used, the final application is so large that it overwhelms the resources of a 4gb MacBook Pro, while the on-the-fly approach does not suffer from this problem. The “1-sent” case is presented to demonstrate the ripple effect caused by using on-the fly. In the other two cases, a very large language model generally overwhelms the timing statistics, regardless of the method being used. But a language model that represents exactly one sentence is very small, and thus the effects of simultaneous inference are readily apparent—the time to retrieve the 1-best sentence is reduced by two orders of magnitude in this experiment. 6 Conclusion We have presented algorithms for forward and backward application of weighted tree transducer cascades, including on-the-fly variants, and demonstrated the benefit of an on-the-fly approach to application. We note that a more formal approach to application of WTTs is being developed, 1065 independent from these efforts, by F ¨ul ¨op (2010). et al.

<p>Author: Xiangyu Duan ; Min Zhang ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: The pipeline of most Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation (PB-SMT) systems starts from automatically word aligned parallel corpus. But word appears to be too fine-grained in some cases such as non-compositional phrasal equivalences, where no clear word alignments exist. Using words as inputs to PBSMT pipeline has inborn deficiency. This paper proposes pseudo-word as a new start point for PB-SMT pipeline. Pseudo-word is a kind of basic multi-word expression that characterizes minimal sequence of consecutive words in sense of translation. By casting pseudo-word searching problem into a parsing framework, we search for pseudo-words in a monolingual way and a bilingual synchronous way. Experiments show that pseudo-word significantly outperforms word for PB-SMT model in both travel translation domain and news translation domain. 1</p><p>5 0.055846136 <a title="186-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-String_Extension_Learning.html">217 acl-2010-String Extension Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Benoit Sagot ; Giorgio Satta</p><p>Abstract: Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRSs) are a grammar formalism capable of modeling discontinuous phrases. Many parsing applications use LCFRSs where the fan-out (a measure of the discontinuity of phrases) does not exceed 2. We present an efficient algorithm for optimal reduction of the length of production right-hand side in LCFRSs with fan-out at most 2. This results in asymptotical running time improvement for known parsing algorithms for this class.</p><p>2 0.62835759 <a title="186-lsi-2" href="./acl-2010-Efficient_Inference_through_Cascades_of_Weighted_Tree_Transducers.html">95 acl-2010-Efficient Inference through Cascades of Weighted Tree Transducers</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan May ; Kevin Knight ; Heiko Vogler</p><p>Abstract: Weighted tree transducers have been proposed as useful formal models for representing syntactic natural language processing applications, but there has been little description of inference algorithms for these automata beyond formal foundations. We give a detailed description of algorithms for application of cascades of weighted tree transducers to weighted tree acceptors, connecting formal theory with actual practice. Additionally, we present novel on-the-fly variants of these algorithms, and compare their performance on a syntax machine translation cascade based on (Yamada and Knight, 2001). 1 Motivation Weighted finite-state transducers have found recent favor as models of natural language (Mohri, 1997). In order to make actual use of systems built with these formalisms we must first calculate the set of possible weighted outputs allowed by the transducer given some input, which we call forward application, or the set of possible weighted inputs given some output, which we call backward application. After application we can do some inference on this result, such as determining its k highest weighted elements. We may also want to divide up our problems into manageable chunks, each represented by a transducer. As noted by Woods (1980), it is easier for designers to write several small transducers where each performs a simple transformation, rather than painstakingly construct a single complicated device. We would like to know, then, the result of transformation of input or output by a cascade of transducers, one operating after the other. As we will see, there are various strategies for approaching this problem. We will consider offline composition, bucket brigade applica- tion, and on-the-fly application. Application of cascades of weighted string transducers (WSTs) has been well-studied (Mohri, Heiko Vogler Technische Universit a¨t Dresden Institut f u¨r Theoretische Informatik 01062 Dresden, Germany he iko .vogle r@ tu-dre s den .de 1997). Less well-studied but of more recent interest is application of cascades of weighted tree transducers (WTTs). We tackle application of WTT cascades in this work, presenting: • • • explicit algorithms for application of WTT casceaxpdelisc novel algorithms for on-the-fly application of nWoTvTe lca alscgoardieths,m mansd f experiments comparing the performance of tehxepseer iamlgeonrtisthm cos.m 2 Strategies for the string case Before we discuss application of WTTs, it is helpful to recall the solution to this problem in the WST domain. We recall previous formal presentations of WSTs (Mohri, 1997) and note informally that they may be represented as directed graphs with designated start and end states and edges labeled with input symbols, output symbols, and weights.1 Fortunately, the solution for WSTs is practically trivial—we achieve application through a series of embedding, composition, and projection operations. Embedding is simply the act of representing a string or regular string language as an identity WST. Composition of WSTs, that is, generating a single WST that captures the transformations of two input WSTs used in sequence, is not at all trivial, but has been well covered in, e.g., (Mohri, 2009), where directly implementable algorithms can be found. Finally, projection is another trivial operation—the domain or range language can be obtained from a WST by ignoring the output or input symbols, respectively, on its arcs, and summing weights on otherwise identical arcs. By embedding an input, composing the result with the given WST, and projecting the result, forward application is accomplished.2 We are then left with a weighted string acceptor (WSA), essentially a weighted, labeled graph, which can be traversed R+1∪W {e+ as∞su}m,te ha thtro thuegh woeuitgh t hi osf p aa ppaetrh t ihsa cta wlceuilgahtetds a asre th ien prod∪uct { +of∞ ∞th}e, wtheaitgh thtes wofe i gtsh etd ogfes a, panatdh t ihsat c athlceu lwateeigdh ats so tfh ae (not necessarily finite) set T of paths is calculated as the sum of the weights of the paths of T. 2For backward applications, the roles of input and output are simply exchanged. 1058 ProceedingUsp opfs thaela 4, 8Stwhe Adnennu,a 1l1- M16ee Jtiunlgy o 2f0 t1h0e.

Because WSTs can be freely composed, extending application to operate on a cascade of WSTs is fairly trivial. The only question is one of composition order: whether to initially compose the cascade into a single transducer (an approach we call offline composition) or to compose the initial embedding with the first transducer, trim useless states, compose the result with the second, and so on (an approach we call bucket brigade). The appropriate strategy generally depends on the structure of the individual transducers. A third approach builds the result incrementally, as dictated by some algorithm that requests information about it. Such an approach, which we call on-the-fly, was described in (Pereira and Riley, 1997; Mohri, 2009; Mohri et al., 2000). If we can efficiently calculate the outgoing edges of a state of the result WSA on demand, without calculating all edges in the entire machine, we can maintain a stand-in for the result structure, a machine consisting at first of only the start state of the true result. As a calling algorithm (e.g., an implementation of Dijkstra’s algorithm) requests information about the result graph, such as the set of outgoing edges from a state, we replace the current stand-in with a richer version by adding the result of the request. The on-the-fly approach has a distinct advantage over the other two methods in that the entire result graph need not be built. A graphical representation of all three methods is presented in Figure 1. 3 AppCliEcdcF//a..53ti64on of treeB tFranscd/d./3.u264cers Now let us revisit these strategies in the setting of trees and tree transducers. Imagine we have a tree or set of trees as input that can be represented as a weighted regular tree grammar3 (WRTG) and a WTT that can transform that input with some weight. We would like to know the k-best trees the WTT can produce as output for that input, along with their weights. We already know of several methods for acquiring k-best trees from a WRTG (Huang and Chiang, 2005; Pauls and Klein, 2009), so we then must ask if, analogously to the string case, WTTs preserve recognizability4 and we can form an application WRTG. Before we begin, however, we must define WTTs and WRTGs. 3.1 Preliminaries5 A ranked alphabet is a finite set Σ such that every member σ ∈ Σ has a rank rk(σ) ∈ N.

(Alexandrakis and Bozapalidis, 1987)) A weighted regular tree grammar (WRTG) is a 4-tuple G = (N, Σ, P, n0) where: 1. N is a finite set of nonterminals, with n0 ∈ N the start nonterminal. 2.

We explicitly allow such summations. A WRTG G is in normal form if each production is either a chain production or is of the form n σ(n1, . . . , nk) where σ ∈ Σ(k) and n1, . . . , nk →∈ σ N(n.

Table 1 presents known results for the top-down tree transducer classes described in Section 3. 1. Unlike the string case, preservation of recognizability is not universal or symmetric. This is important for us, because we can only construct an application WRTG, i.e., a WRTG representing the result of application, if we can ensure that the language generated by application is in fact recognizable. Of the types under consideration, only wxLNT and wLNT preserve forward recognizability. The two classes marked as open questions and the other classes, which are superclasses of wNT, do not or are presumed not to. All subclasses of wxLT preserve backward recognizability.7 We do not consider cases where recognizability is not preserved tshuamt in the remainder of this paper. If a transducer M of a class that preserves forward recognizability is applied to a WRTG G, we can call the forward ap7Note that the introduction of weights limits recognizability preservation considerably. For example, (unweighted) xT preserves backward recognizability. plication WRTG M(G). and if M preserves backward recognizability, we can call the backward application WRTG M(G)/. Now that we have explained the application problem in the context of weighted tree transducers and determined the classes for which application is possible, let us consider how to build forward and backward application WRTGs. Our basic approach mimics that taken for WSTs by using an embed-compose-project strategy. As in string world, if we can embed the input in a transducer, compose with the given transducer, and project the result, we can obtain the application WRTG. Embedding a WRTG in a wLNT is a trivial operation—if the WRTG is in normal form and chain production-free,8 for every production of the form n − →w σ(n1 , . . . , nk), create a rule ofthe form n.σ(x1 , . . . , xk) − →w σ(n1 .x1, . . . , nk.xk). Range × projection of a w− x→LN σT(n is also trivial—for every q ∈ Q and u ∈ T∆ (Q X) create a production of the form q ∈−→w T u(0 where )u 0c is formed from u by replacing al−l → →lea uves of the form q.x with the leaf q, i.e., removing references to variables, and w is the sum of the weights of all rules of the form q.y → u in R.9 Domain projection for wxLT is bq.eyst →exp ulai inne dR b.y way of example. The left side of a rule is preserved, with variables leaves replaced by their associated states from the right side. So, the rule q1.σ(γ(x1) , x2) − →w δ(q2.x2, β(α, q3.x1)) would yield the production q1 q− →w σ(γ(q3) , q2) in the domain projection. Howev− →er, aσ dγe(lqeting rule such as q1.σ(x1 , x2) − →w γ(q2.x2) necessitates the introduction of a new →non γte(rqminal ⊥ that can genienrtartoed aullc toiof nT Σo fw ai nthe wwe niognhtte r1m . The only missing piece in our embed-composeproject strategy is composition. Algorithm 1, which is based on the declarative construction of Maletti (2006), generates the syntactic composition of a wxLT and a wLNT, a generalization of the basic composition construction of Baker (1979). It calls Algorithm 2, which determines the sequences of rules in the second transducer that match the right side of a single rule in the × first transducer. Since the embedded WRTG is of type wLNT, it may be either the first or second argument provided to Algorithm 1, depending on whether the application is forward or backward. We can thus use the embed-compose-project strategy for forward application of wLNT and backward application of wxLT and wxLNT. Note that we cannot use this strategy for forward applica8Without loss of generality we assume this is so, since standard algorithms exist to remove chain productions (Kuich, 1998; E´sik and Kuich, 2003; Mohri, 2009) and convert into normal form (Alexandrakis and Bozapalidis, 1987). 9Finitely many such productions may be formed. 1061 tion of wxLNT, even though that class preserves recognizability.

We will revisit the three strategies for accomplishing application discussed above for the string case. In order for offline composition to be a viable strategy, the transducers in the cascade must be closed under composition. Unfortunately, of the classes that preserve recognizability, only wLNT × is closed under composition (G´ ecseg and Steinby, 1984; Baker, 1979; Maletti et al., 2009; F ¨ul ¨op and Vogler, 2009). However, the general lack of composability of tree transducers does not preclude us from conducting forward application of a cascade. We revisit the bucket brigade approach, which in Section 2 appeared to be little more than a choice of composition order. As discussed previously, application of a single transducer involves an embedding, a composition, and a projection. The embedded WRTG is in the class wLNT, and the projection forms another WRTG. As long as every transducer in the cascade can be composed with a wLNT to its left or right, depending on the application type, application of a cascade is possible. Note that this embed-compose-project process is somewhat more burdensome than in the string case. For strings, application is obtained by a single embedding, a series of compositions, and a single projecAlgorithm 2 COVER 1: inputs 2: u ∈ T∆ (Q1 X) 3: wuT ∈ M T2 = (Q×2, X X∆), Γ, R2, q20 ) 4: state q2 ∈ Q2 ×× × 5: outputs 6: set of pairs (z, w) with z ∈ TΓ ((Q1 Q2) X) fsoetrm ofed p ab yir so (nze, ,o wr m) worieth hsu zcc ∈es Tsful runs× ×on Q Qu )b y × ×ru Xles) in R2, starting from q2, and w ∈ R+∞ the sum of the weights of all such runs,. 7: complexity 8: O(|R2|size(u)) 9: 10: 11: 12: 13: 14: if u(ε) is of the form (q1,x) ∈ Q1× X then zinit ← ((q1 q2), x) else zinit ← ⊥ Πlast ←← ←{(z ⊥init, {((ε, ε), q2)}, 1)} for all← v ∈ pos(u) εsu,εch), tqha)t} u(v) ∈ ∆(k) for some fko ≥r 0ll li nv p ∈ref ipxo osr(ude)r sduoc 15: ≥Π v0 i←n p ∅r 16: for ←all ∅(z, θ, w) ∈ Πlast do 17: rf aorll a(zll, vθ0, ∈w )lv ∈(z Π) such that z(v0) = ⊥ do 18: 19: 20: 21: 22: 23: 24: 25: 26: 27: 28: , dfoor all(θ(v,v0).u(v)(x1,...,xk) −w →0h)∈R2 θ0 ← θ For←m sθubstitution mapping ϕ : (Q2 X) → TΓ((Q1 Q2 X) {⊥}). f→or Ti = 1to× ×k dQo for all v00 ∈ pos(h) such that h(v00) = (q02 , xi∈) for some q20 ∈ Q2 do θ0(vi, v0v00) ← q20 if u(vi) ←is q of the form (q1, x) ∈ Q1 X then ∪ ,ϕ(x)q20 ∈, x Qi) ←× X((q t1h, eqn20), x) else ϕ(q20, xi) ← ⊥ Πv ← Πv {(z[ϕ)( ←h)] ⊥v0 , θ0, w · w0)} ∪ 29: Πlast ← Πv 30: Z ← {z |← ←(z Π, θ, Xw) 31: return {(z, X ∈ (z ,θ ,wX) X∈Πl Πlast} w) | z ∈ Z} ast X tion, whereas application for trees is obtained by a series of (embed, compose, project) operations. 4.1 On-the-fly algorithms We next consider on-the-fly algorithms for application. Similar to the string case, an on-thefly approach is driven by a calling algorithm that periodically needs to know the productions in a WRTG with a common left side nonterminal. The embed-compose-project approach produces an entire application WRTG before any inference algorithm is run. In order to admit an on-the-fly approach we describe algorithms that only generate those productions in a WRTG that have a given left nonterminal. In this section we extend Definition 3. 1 as follows: a WRTG is a 6tuple G = (N, P, n0,M,G) where N, P, and n0 are defined as in Definition 3. 1, and either M = G = ∅,10 or M is a wxLNT and G is a normMal = =fo Grm =, c ∅h,ain production-free WRTG such that Σ, 10In which case Σ, the definition is functionally unchanged from before. 1062 w t[xLypN] LeT (a)pPresOYNer Qovsateiodn?f(Grwe´ca(Fsd¨uMrg(lKeS¨coa punelgsid cowtihuSza,[rtxlbce1.2i]9,l0Nn2tybT091), 984w [txy](pbL Ne)T PrespvatiosYnNero svfebda?ckw(rFdu¨MlSeo¨c apesgl onwtiuza[r,xlcb.2]ei,NlL0t2yT 91)0 Table 1: Preservation of forward and backward recognizability for various classes of top-down tree transducers.

We have also designed an analogous onthe-fly PRODUCE algorithm for backward application on linear WTT. We have now defined several on-the-fly and bucket brigade algorithms, and also discussed the possibility of embed-compose-project and offline composition strategies to application of cascades of tree transducers. Tables 2a and 2b summarize the available methods of forward and backward application of cascades for recognizabilitypreserving tree transducer classes. 5 Decoding Experiments The main purpose of this paper has been to present novel algorithms for performing applica- tion. However, it is important to demonstrate these algorithms on real data. We thus demonstrate bucket-brigade and on-the-fly backward application on a typical NLP task cast as a cascade of wLNT.

The Japanese trees are unlabeled, meaning they have syntactic structure but all nodes are labeled “X”. We then cast this modified model as a cascade of LNT tree transducers.

The language model is cast as an identity WTT and thus fits naturally into the experimental framework. In our experiments we try several different language models to demonstrate varying performance of the application algorithms. The most realistic language model is a PCFG. Each rule captures the probability of a particular sequence of child labels given a parent label. This model has 7,765 rules. To demonstrate more extreme cases of the usefulness of the on-the-fly approach, we build a language model that recognizes exactly the 2,087 trees in the training corpus, each with equal weight. It has 39,455 rules. Finally, to be ultraspecific, we include a form of the “specific” language model just described, but only allow the English counterpart of the particular Japanese sentence being decoded in the language.

We evaluate the speed of each approach: bucket brigade and on-the-fly. The algorithm we use to obtain the 1-best path is a modification of the kbest algorithm of Pauls and Klein (2009). Our algorithm finds the 1-best path in a WRTG and admits an on-the-fly approach. The results of the experiments are shown in Table 3.

The results for the other two language models demonstrate more keenly the potential advantage that an on-the-fly approach provides—the simultaneous incorporation of information from all models allows application to be done more effectively than if each information source is considered in sequence. In the “exact” case, where a very large language model that simply recognizes each of the 2,087 trees in the training corpus is used, the final application is so large that it overwhelms the resources of a 4gb MacBook Pro, while the on-the-fly approach does not suffer from this problem. The “1-sent” case is presented to demonstrate the ripple effect caused by using on-the fly. In the other two cases, a very large language model generally overwhelms the timing statistics, regardless of the method being used. But a language model that represents exactly one sentence is very small, and thus the effects of simultaneous inference are readily apparent—the time to retrieve the 1-best sentence is reduced by two orders of magnitude in this experiment. 6 Conclusion We have presented algorithms for forward and backward application of weighted tree transducer cascades, including on-the-fly variants, and demonstrated the benefit of an on-the-fly approach to application. We note that a more formal approach to application of WTTs is being developed, 1065 independent from these efforts, by F ¨ul ¨op (2010). et al.

<p>Author: Jeffrey Heinz</p><p>Abstract: This paper provides a unified, learningtheoretic analysis of several learnable classes of languages discussed previously in the literature. The analysis shows that for these classes an incremental, globally consistent, locally conservative, set-driven learner always exists. Additionally, the analysis provides a recipe for constructing new learnable classes. Potential applications include learnable models for aspects of natural language and cognition.</p><p>4 0.516967 <a title="186-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Computing_Weakest_Readings.html">67 acl-2010-Computing Weakest Readings</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexander Koller ; Stefan Thater</p><p>Abstract: We present an efficient algorithm for computing the weakest readings of semantically ambiguous sentences. A corpus-based evaluation with a large-scale grammar shows that our algorithm reduces over 80% of sentences to one or two readings, in negligible runtime, and thus makes it possible to work with semantic representations derived by deep large-scale grammars.</p><p>5 0.49247712 <a title="186-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Estimating_Strictly_Piecewise_Distributions.html">103 acl-2010-Estimating Strictly Piecewise Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Jeffrey Heinz ; James Rogers</p><p>Abstract: Strictly Piecewise (SP) languages are a subclass of regular languages which encode certain kinds of long-distance dependencies that are found in natural languages. Like the classes in the Chomsky and Subregular hierarchies, there are many independently converging characterizations of the SP class (Rogers et al., to appear). Here we define SP distributions and show that they can be efficiently estimated from positive data.</p><p>6 0.46526784 <a title="186-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-A_Generalized-Zero-Preserving_Method_for_Compact_Encoding_of_Concept_Lattices.html">7 acl-2010-A Generalized-Zero-Preserving Method for Compact Encoding of Concept Lattices</a></p>

<p>Author: Benoit Sagot ; Giorgio Satta</p><p>Abstract: Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRSs) are a grammar formalism capable of modeling discontinuous phrases. Many parsing applications use LCFRSs where the fan-out (a measure of the discontinuity of phrases) does not exceed 2. We present an efficient algorithm for optimal reduction of the length of production right-hand side in LCFRSs with fan-out at most 2. This results in asymptotical running time improvement for known parsing algorithms for this class.</p><p>2 0.74192697 <a title="186-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Combining_Data_and_Mathematical_Models_of_Language_Change.html">61 acl-2010-Combining Data and Mathematical Models of Language Change</a></p>
<p>Author: Morgan Sonderegger ; Partha Niyogi</p><p>Abstract: English noun/verb (N/V) pairs (contract, cement) have undergone complex patterns of change between 3 stress patterns for several centuries. We describe a longitudinal dataset of N/V pair pronunciations, leading to a set of properties to be accounted for by any computational model. We analyze the dynamics of 5 dynamical systems models of linguistic populations, each derived from a model of learning by individuals. We compare each model’s dynamics to a set of properties observed in the N/V data, and reason about how assumptions about individual learning affect population-level dynamics.</p><p>3 0.7133894 <a title="186-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Bayesian_Synchronous_Tree-Substitution_Grammar_Induction_and_Its_Application_to_Sentence_Compression.html">46 acl-2010-Bayesian Synchronous Tree-Substitution Grammar Induction and Its Application to Sentence Compression</a></p>
<p>Author: Elif Yamangil ; Stuart M. Shieber</p><p>Abstract: We describe our experiments with training algorithms for tree-to-tree synchronous tree-substitution grammar (STSG) for monolingual translation tasks such as sentence compression and paraphrasing. These translation tasks are characterized by the relative ability to commit to parallel parse trees and availability of word alignments, yet the unavailability of large-scale data, calling for a Bayesian tree-to-tree formalism. We formalize nonparametric Bayesian STSG with epsilon alignment in full generality, and provide a Gibbs sampling algorithm for posterior inference tailored to the task of extractive sentence compression. We achieve improvements against a number of baselines, including expectation maximization and variational Bayes training, illustrating the merits of nonparametric inference over the space of grammars as opposed to sparse parametric inference with a fixed grammar.</p><p>4 0.67788446 <a title="186-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-A_New_Approach_to_Improving_Multilingual_Summarization_Using_a_Genetic_Algorithm.html">11 acl-2010-A New Approach to Improving Multilingual Summarization Using a Genetic Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Marina Litvak ; Mark Last ; Menahem Friedman</p><p>Abstract: Automated summarization methods can be defined as “language-independent,” if they are not based on any languagespecific knowledge. Such methods can be used for multilingual summarization defined by Mani (2001) as “processing several languages, with summary in the same language as input.” In this paper, we introduce MUSE, a languageindependent approach for extractive summarization based on the linear optimization of several sentence ranking measures using a genetic algorithm. We tested our methodology on two languages—English and Hebrew—and evaluated its performance with ROUGE-1 Recall vs. state- of-the-art extractive summarization approaches. Our results show that MUSE performs better than the best known multilingual approach (TextRank1) in both languages. Moreover, our experimental results on a bilingual (English and Hebrew) document collection suggest that MUSE does not need to be retrained on each language and the same model can be used across at least two different languages.</p><p>5 0.50720233 <a title="186-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Blocked_Inference_in_Bayesian_Tree_Substitution_Grammars.html">53 acl-2010-Blocked Inference in Bayesian Tree Substitution Grammars</a></p>
<p>Author: Trevor Cohn ; Phil Blunsom</p><p>Abstract: Learning a tree substitution grammar is very challenging due to derivational ambiguity. Our recent approach used a Bayesian non-parametric model to induce good derivations from treebanked input (Cohn et al., 2009), biasing towards small grammars composed of small generalisable productions. In this paper we present a novel training method for the model using a blocked Metropolis-Hastings sampler in place of the previous method’s local Gibbs sampler. The blocked sampler makes considerably larger moves than the local sampler and consequently con- verges in less time. A core component of the algorithm is a grammar transformation which represents an infinite tree substitution grammar in a finite context free grammar. This enables efficient blocked inference for training and also improves the parsing algorithm. Both algorithms are shown to improve parsing accuracy.</p><p>6 0.48380253 <a title="186-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Efficient_Inference_through_Cascades_of_Weighted_Tree_Transducers.html">95 acl-2010-Efficient Inference through Cascades of Weighted Tree Transducers</a></p>

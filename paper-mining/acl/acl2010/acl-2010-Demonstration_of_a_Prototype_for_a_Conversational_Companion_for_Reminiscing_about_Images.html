</p><p>2 The prototype platform was evaluated, and we describe this briefly; it is also designed to support more extensive forms of emotion detection carried by both speech and lexical content, as well as extended forms of machine learning. [sent-6, score-0.075]
</p><p>3 The Companion communicates with the user primarily through speech, but also using other technologies such as touch screens and sensors. [sent-9, score-0.156]
</p><p>4 This paper describes the functionality and system modules of the Senior Companion, one of two initial prototypes built in the first two years of the project. [sent-10, score-0.203]
</p><p>5 The SC provides a multimodal interface for eliciting, retrieving and inferring per-  sonal information from elderly users by means of conversation about their photographs. [sent-11, score-0.197]
</p><p>6 The Companion, through conversation, elicits life memoRoberta Catizone University of Sheffield, UK r . [sent-12, score-0.077]
</p><p>7 It is assumed that most life information will soon be stored on the internet (as in the Memories for Life project: http://www. [sent-21, score-0.194]
</p><p>8 org/) and we have linked the SC directly to photo inventories in Facebook (see below). [sent-23, score-0.455]
</p><p>9 The overall aim of the SC project (not yet achieved) is to produce a coherent life narrative for its user from conversations about personal photos, although its short-term  goals, reported here, are to assist, amuse and entertain the user. [sent-24, score-0.317]
</p><p>10 A stack of these DAFs is the virtual machine that models the ongoing dialogue by means of shared user and Companion initiative and generates appropriate responses. [sent-26, score-0.487]
</p><p>11 In this description of the demo, we shall: •  describe the current SC prototype’s functionality;  •  set out its architecture and modules, focusing on the Natural Language Under-  standing module and the Dialogue Manager. [sent-27, score-0.123]
</p><p>12 The Senior Companion System The Senior Companion prototype (Wilks, 2010) was designed to make a rapid advance in the first two years of the project so as to be basis for a second round of prototypes embodying more advanced ML. [sent-34, score-0.156]
</p><p>13 The central function of the SC is engaging the user in discussion about their photographs: where and when they were taken, details about  the people in them and their relationship to the user and each other. [sent-36, score-0.397]
</p><p>14 Once a photo is loaded, it is processed with face recognition software to identify any faces in it. [sent-37, score-0.493]
</p><p>15 The recognition software, OpenCV, provides positional information by identifying the face coordinates and this information is exploited in the Dialogue Manager by making explicit reference to the position of people in the photograph (the person on the left, right, center, etc. [sent-38, score-0.089]
</p><p>16 The system discusses properties of the photo as well as properties and relationships of the people in the photos. [sent-40, score-0.558]
</p><p>17 The news reading feature adds an interesting accompaniment to the photo domain and demonstrates the ability of the system to handle more than one kind of application at a time, and news has, of course, an unconstrained vocabulary. [sent-41, score-0.566]
</p><p>18 SC: Please tell me how you know the doctor U: Uh, he's a friend. [sent-44, score-0.051]
</p><p>19 SC: How old was the doctor when this photo was taken? [sent-45, score-0.47]
</p><p>20 SC: How old was your daughter Octavia when this photo was taken? [sent-52, score-0.453]
</p><p>21 It is a key feature of the SC that it can make simple inferences from family relationships it already knows (e. [sent-63, score-0.193]
</p><p>22 This real time access to unconstrained place information on the internet is an attempt to break out of classic AI systems that only know the budget of facts they have been primed with. [sent-66, score-0.046]
</p><p>23 This basic system provides the components for future development of the SC, as well as its main use as a device to generate more conversation data for machine learning research in the future. [sent-67, score-0.174]
</p><p>24 Key features of the SC are listed below followed by a description of the system architecture and modules. [sent-68, score-0.086]
</p><p>25 The SC: • Contains a visually appealing multi-  •  •  •  •  •  modal interface with a character avatar to mediate the system’s functionality to the user. [sent-69, score-0.141]
</p><p>26 Interacts with the user using multiple modalities – speech and touch. [sent-70, score-0.156]
</p><p>27 Accepts pre-annotated (XML) photo inventories as a means for creating richer dialogues more quickly. [sent-72, score-0.455]
</p><p>28 Engages in conversation with the user about topics within the photo domain: when and where the photo was taken, discussion of the people in the photo including their relationships to the user. [sent-73, score-1.652]
</p><p>29 Reads news from three categories: politics, business and sports. [sent-74, score-0.055]
</p><p>30 73  • •  Tells jokes taken from an internet-based joke website. [sent-75, score-0.114]
</p><p>31 Retains all user input for reference in repeat user sessions, in addition to the  •  knowledge base that has been updated by the Dialogue Manager on the basis of what was said. [sent-76, score-0.351]
</p><p>32 Contains a fully integrated Knowledge Base for maintaining user information including: o Ontological information which is exploited by the Dialogue Manager and provides domainspecific relations between fundamental concepts. [sent-77, score-0.156]
</p><p>33 o A mechanism for storing information in a triple store (SubjectPredicate-Object) - the RDF Semantic Web format - for handling unexpected user input that falls outside of the photo domain, e. [sent-78, score-0.705]
</p><p>34 arbitrary locations in which photos might have been taken. [sent-80, score-0.142]
</p><p>35 As can be seen from Figure 2, the architecture contains three abstract level components – Connectors, Input Handlers and Application Services –together with the Dialogue Manager and the Natural Language Understander (NLU). [sent-84, score-0.049]
</p><p>36 Figure 2: Senior Companion system architecture Connectors form a communication bridge between the core system and external applications. [sent-85, score-0.171]
</p><p>37 The external application refers to any modules or systems which provide a specific set of functionalities that might be changed in the future. [sent-86, score-0.133]
</p><p>38 It hides the underlying complex communication protocol details and provides a general interface for the main system to use. [sent-88, score-0.097]
</p><p>39 This abstraction decouples the connection of external and internal modules and makes changing and adding new external modules easier. [sent-89, score-0.266]
</p><p>40 At this moment, there  tion if no annotation  file is associated  with the  photo and checking the Knowledge Base in case 74  the photo being processed has been discussed in earlier sessions. [sent-90, score-0.878]
</p><p>41 Dragon Event Handler deals with dragon speech recognition commands sent from the interface while the General Handler processes user utterances and photo change events of the interface. [sent-91, score-0.727]
</p><p>42 Application Services are a group of internal modules which provide interfaces for the Dialogue Action Forms (DAF) to use. [sent-92, score-0.085]
</p><p>43 It has an easyto-use high-level interface for general DAF designers to code associated tests and actions as well as a low level interface for advanced DAFs. [sent-93, score-0.12]
</p><p>44 It also provides the communication link between DAFs and the internal system and enables DAFs  to access system functionalities. [sent-94, score-0.074]
</p><p>45 Following is a brief summary of modules grouped into Application Services. [sent-95, score-0.085]
</p><p>46 News Feeders are a set of RSS Feeders for fetching news from the internet. [sent-96, score-0.102]
</p><p>47 Three different news feeders have been implemented for fetching news from BBC website Sports, Politics and Business channels. [sent-97, score-0.228]
</p><p>48 There is also a Jokes Feeder to fetch Jokes from internet in a similar way. [sent-98, score-0.046]
</p><p>49 During the conversation, the user can request news about particular topics and the SC simply reads the news downloaded through the feeds. [sent-99, score-0.266]
</p><p>50 The DAF Repository is a list of DAFs loaded from files generated by the DAF Editor. [sent-100, score-0.053]
</p><p>51 The Natural Language Generation (NLG) module is responsible for randomly selecting a system utterance from a template. [sent-101, score-0.169]
</p><p>52 Session Knowledge  is the place where global  information for a particular running session is stored. [sent-104, score-0.038]
</p><p>53 For example, the name of the user who is running the session, the list of photos being discussed in this session and the list of user utterances etc. [sent-105, score-0.542]
</p><p>54 The Knowledge Base is the data store of persistent knowledge. [sent-106, score-0.06]
</p><p>55 It is implemented as an RDF triplestore using a Jena implementation. [sent-107, score-0.047]
</p><p>56 The triplestore API is a layer built upon a traditional relational database. [sent-108, score-0.047]
</p><p>57 The application can save/retrieve information as RDF triples rather than table records. [sent-109, score-0.073]
</p><p>58 The structure of knowledge represented in RDF triples is discussed later. [sent-110, score-0.073]
</p><p>59 The Reasoner is used to perform inference on existing knowledge in the Knowledge Base (see example in next section). [sent-111, score-0.043]
</p><p>60 The Output Manager deals with sending messages to external applications. [sent-112, score-0.09]
</p><p>61 There are three different channels in the system: the text channel, the interface command channel and the avatar command channel. [sent-114, score-0.21]
</p><p>62 Those channels could be subscribed to by any connectors  and handled respectively. [sent-115, score-0.113]
</p><p>63 Dialogue understanding and inference Every utterance is passed through the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) module for processing. [sent-117, score-0.175]
</p><p>64 This module uses a set of wellestablished natural language processing tools such as those found in the GATE (Cunningham, et al. [sent-118, score-0.074]
</p><p>65 These components have been further enhanced for the SC system by adding 1) new and improved gazetteers including family relations and 2) accompanying extraction rules . [sent-121, score-0.17]
</p><p>66 The Named Entity (NE) recognizer is a key part of the NLU module and recognizes the significant entities required to process dialogue in the photo domain: PERSON NAMES, LOCATION NAMES, FAMILY RELATIONS and DATES. [sent-122, score-0.729]
</p><p>67 Apart from the gazetteers mentioned earlier and the hundreds of extraction rules already present in GATE, about 20 new extraction rules using the JAPE rule lan-  guage were also developed for the SC module. [sent-124, score-0.068]
</p><p>68 These included rules which identify complex dates, family relationships, negations and other information related to the SC domain. [sent-125, score-0.065]
</p><p>69 The following is an example of a simple rule used to identify relationship in utterances such as “Mary is my sister”: Macro: RELATIONSHIP_IDENTIFIER ( ({Token. [sent-126, score-0.093]
</p><p>70 minorType=="Relationship"}):relation ship) 75  Using this rule with the example mentioned earlier, the rule interprets person1 as referring to the speaker so, if the name of the user speaking is John (which was known from previous conversations), it is utilized. [sent-132, score-0.156]
</p><p>71 This name is recognised by using the gazetteers we have in the system (which contain about 40,000 first names). [sent-136, score-0.105]
</p><p>72 The relationship is once again identified using the almost 800 unique relationships added to the gazetteer. [sent-137, score-0.103]
</p><p>73 With this information, the NLU module identifies Information Extraction patterns in the dialogue that represent significant content with respect to a user's life and photos. [sent-138, score-0.387]
</p><p>74 The information obtained (such as Mary=sisterof John) is passed to the Dialogue Manager (DM) and then stored in the knowledge base (KB). [sent-139, score-0.11]
</p><p>75 Given, in the example above, that Mary is the sister of John, the NLU knows that sister is a relationship between two people and is a key relationship. [sent-141, score-0.281]
</p><p>76 the user is not interested in the parts-ofspeech of a word. [sent-145, score-0.156]
</p><p>77 Thus, this information is discarded by the DM and not stored in the KB. [sent-146, score-0.071]
</p><p>78 The  NLU module also identifies a Dialogue Act Tag for each user utterance based on the DAMSL set of DA tags and prior work done jointly with the University of Albany (Webb et al. [sent-147, score-0.288]
</p><p>79 The KB is a long-term store of information which makes it possible for the SC to retrieve information stored between different sessions. [sent-149, score-0.131]
</p><p>80 The structure of the data in the database is an RDF triple, and the KB is more commonly referred to as a triple store. [sent-151, score-0.07]
</p><p>81 In mathematical terms, a triple store is nothing more than a large database of interconnected graphs. [sent-152, score-0.13]
</p><p>82 Each triple is made up of a subject, a predicate and an object. [sent-153, score-0.07]
</p><p>83 So, if we took the previous example, Mary sisterof John; Mary would be the subject, sister-of would be the predicate and John would be the object. [sent-154, score-0.119]
</p><p>84 The inference engine is an important part of the system because it allows us to discover new facts beyond what is elicited from the conversation with the user. [sent-155, score-0.257]
</p><p>85 This combination of triple store, inference engine and inference rules makes a system which is weak but powerful enough to mimic human reasoning in this domain and thus simulate basic  intelligence in the SC. [sent-164, score-0.233]
</p><p>86 For our prototype, we are using the JENA Semantic Web Framework for the inference engine together with a MySQL database as the knowledge base. [sent-165, score-0.083]
</p><p>87 However, this system of family relationships is not enough to cover all the possible topics which can crop up during a conversation and, in such circumstances, the DM switches to an open-world model and instructs the NLU to seek further information online. [sent-166, score-0.299]
</p><p>88 The semantic tagger makes use of gazetteers and IE rules in order to accomplish 76  this task. [sent-171, score-0.102]
</p><p>89 It also goes through the KB and retrieves any triples related to “Paris”. [sent-172, score-0.073]
</p><p>90 Inference is then performed on this data and the new information generated by this process is stored back in the KB. [sent-173, score-0.071]
</p><p>91 The system already knows how to query these sites and interpret their output by using predefined wrappers. [sent-175, score-0.105]
</p><p>92 This is then used to extract relevant information from the mentioned sites webpages by sending an online query to these sites and storing the information retrieved in the triple-store. [sent-176, score-0.042]
</p><p>93 The NLU would then store in the KB triples such as [Paris, sight-  seeing, Eiffel Tower] and the DM with the help of the NLG would ask the user “I’ve heard that the X is a very famous spot. [sent-179, score-0.289]
</p><p>94 On the other hand, if the topic requested by the DM is unknown, or the semantic tagger is not capable of understanding the semantic category, the system uses a normal search engine (and this is what we call “hybrid-world”: the move outside the world the system already knows). [sent-182, score-0.148]
</p><p>95 These pages are then processed using ANNIE and their tagged attributes are analyzed. [sent-184, score-0.04]
</p><p>96 Evaluation The notion of companionship is not yet one with any agreed evaluation strategy or metric, though developing one is part of the main project itself. [sent-194, score-0.045]
</p><p>97 Conventional dialogue evaluations often use measures like “stickiness” to determine how much a user will stay with or stick with a dialogue system and not leave it, presumably because they are disappointed or find it lacking in some feature. [sent-196, score-0.665]

<p>Author: Srinivasan Janarthanam ; Oliver Lemon</p><p>Abstract: We present a data-driven approach to learn user-adaptive referring expression generation (REG) policies for spoken dialogue systems. Referring expressions can be difficult to understand in technical domains where users may not know the technical ‘jargon’ names of the domain entities. In such cases, dialogue systems must be able to model the user’s (lexical) domain knowledge and use appropriate referring expressions. We present a reinforcement learning (RL) framework in which the sys- tem learns REG policies which can adapt to unknown users online. Furthermore, unlike supervised learning methods which require a large corpus of expert adaptive behaviour to train on, we show that effective adaptive policies can be learned from a small dialogue corpus of non-adaptive human-machine interaction, by using a RL framework and a statistical user simulation. We show that in comparison to adaptive hand-coded baseline policies, the learned policy performs significantly better, with an 18.6% average increase in adaptation accuracy. The best learned policy also takes less dialogue time (average 1.07 min less) than the best hand-coded policy. This is because the learned policies can adapt online to changing evidence about the user’s domain expertise.</p><p>3 0.14711928 <a title="82-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Optimising_Information_Presentation_for_Spoken_Dialogue_Systems.html">187 acl-2010-Optimising Information Presentation for Spoken Dialogue Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Verena Rieser ; Oliver Lemon ; Xingkun Liu</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to Information Presentation (IP) in Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) using a data-driven statistical optimisation framework for content planning and attribute selection. First we collect data in a Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) experiment and use it to build a supervised model of human behaviour. This forms a baseline for measuring the performance of optimised policies, developed from this data using Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. We show that the optimised policies significantly outperform the baselines in a variety of generation scenarios: while the supervised model is able to attain up to 87.6% of the possible reward on this task, the RL policies are significantly better in 5 out of 6 scenarios, gaining up to 91.5% of the total possible reward. The RL policies perform especially well in more complex scenarios. We are also the first to show that adding predictive “lower level” features (e.g. from the NLG realiser) is important for optimising IP strategies according to user preferences. This provides new insights into the nature of the IP problem for SDS.</p><p>4 0.13481817 <a title="82-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Towards_Relational_POMDPs_for_Adaptive_Dialogue_Management.html">239 acl-2010-Towards Relational POMDPs for Adaptive Dialogue Management</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre Lison</p><p>Abstract: Open-ended spoken interactions are typically characterised by both structural complexity and high levels of uncertainty, making dialogue management in such settings a particularly challenging problem. Traditional approaches have focused on providing theoretical accounts for either the uncertainty or the complexity of spoken dialogue, but rarely considered the two issues simultaneously. This paper describes ongoing work on a new approach to dialogue management which attempts to fill this gap. We represent the interaction as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) over a rich state space incorporating both dialogue, user, and environment models. The tractability of the resulting POMDP can be preserved using a mechanism for dynamically constraining the action space based on prior knowledge over locally relevant dialogue structures. These constraints are encoded in a small set of general rules expressed as a Markov Logic network. The first-order expressivity of Markov Logic enables us to leverage the rich relational structure of the problem and efficiently abstract over large regions ofthe state and action spaces.</p><p>5 0.12533194 <a title="82-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Non-Cooperation_in_Dialogue.html">178 acl-2010-Non-Cooperation in Dialogue</a></p>

<p>Author: Ethan Selfridge ; Peter Heeman</p><p>Abstract: Current turn-taking approaches for spoken dialogue systems rely on the speaker releasing the turn before the other can take it. This reliance results in restricted interactions that can lead to inefficient dialogues. In this paper we present a model we refer to as Importance-Driven Turn-Bidding that treats turn-taking as a negotiative process. Each conversant bids for the turn based on the importance of the intended utterance, and Reinforcement Learning is used to indirectly learn this parameter. We find that Importance-Driven Turn-Bidding performs better than two current turntaking approaches in an artificial collaborative slot-filling domain. The negotiative nature of this model creates efficient dia- logues, and supports the improvement of mixed-initiative interaction.</p><p>3 0.74762404 <a title="82-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-Non-Cooperation_in_Dialogue.html">178 acl-2010-Non-Cooperation in Dialogue</a></p>

<p>Author: Verena Rieser ; Oliver Lemon ; Xingkun Liu</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to Information Presentation (IP) in Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) using a data-driven statistical optimisation framework for content planning and attribute selection. First we collect data in a Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) experiment and use it to build a supervised model of human behaviour. This forms a baseline for measuring the performance of optimised policies, developed from this data using Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. We show that the optimised policies significantly outperform the baselines in a variety of generation scenarios: while the supervised model is able to attain up to 87.6% of the possible reward on this task, the RL policies are significantly better in 5 out of 6 scenarios, gaining up to 91.5% of the total possible reward. The RL policies perform especially well in more complex scenarios. We are also the first to show that adding predictive “lower level” features (e.g. from the NLG realiser) is important for optimising IP strategies according to user preferences. This provides new insights into the nature of the IP problem for SDS.</p><p>6 0.71264303 <a title="82-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Now%2C_Where_Was_I%3F_Resumption_Strategies_for_an_In-Vehicle_Dialogue_System.html">179 acl-2010-Now, Where Was I?

<p>Author: Ashish Vaswani ; Adam Pauls ; David Chiang</p><p>Abstract: The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle is a method for model selection that trades off between the explanation of the data by the model and the complexity of the model itself. Inspired by the MDL principle, we develop an objective function for generative models that captures the description of the data by the model (log-likelihood) and the description of the model (model size). We also develop a efficient general search algorithm based on the MAP-EM framework to optimize this function. Since recent work has shown that minimizing the model size in a Hidden Markov Model for part-of-speech (POS) tagging leads to higher accuracies, we test our approach by applying it to this problem. The search algorithm involves a simple change to EM and achieves high POS tagging accuracies on both English and Italian data sets.</p><p>3 0.49817643 <a title="82-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Minimized_Models_and_Grammar-Informed_Initialization_for_Supertagging_with_Highly_Ambiguous_Lexicons.html">172 acl-2010-Minimized Models and Grammar-Informed Initialization for Supertagging with Highly Ambiguous Lexicons</a></p>
<p>Author: Sujith Ravi ; Jason Baldridge ; Kevin Knight</p><p>Abstract: We combine two complementary ideas for learning supertaggers from highly ambiguous lexicons: grammar-informed tag transitions and models minimized via integer programming. Each strategy on its own greatly improves performance over basic expectation-maximization training with a bitag Hidden Markov Model, which we show on the CCGbank and CCG-TUT corpora. The strategies provide further error reductions when combined. We describe a new two-stage integer programming strategy that efficiently deals with the high degree of ambiguity on these datasets while obtaining the full effect of model minimization.</p><p>4 0.49693298 <a title="82-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Using_Anaphora_Resolution_to_Improve_Opinion_Target_Identification_in_Movie_Reviews.html">251 acl-2010-Using Anaphora Resolution to Improve Opinion Target Identification in Movie Reviews</a></p>

<p>Author: Min Zhang ; Hui Zhang ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a convolution forest kernel to effectively explore rich structured features embedded in a packed parse forest. As opposed to the convolution tree kernel, the proposed forest kernel does not have to commit to a single best parse tree, is thus able to explore very large object spaces and much more structured features embedded in a forest. This makes the proposed kernel more robust against parsing errors and data sparseness issues than the convolution tree kernel. The paper presents the formal definition of convolution forest kernel and also illustrates the computing algorithm to fast compute the proposed convolution forest kernel. Experimental results on two NLP applications, relation extraction and semantic role labeling, show that the proposed forest kernel significantly outperforms the baseline of the convolution tree kernel. 1</p><p>6 0.48903173 <a title="82-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Entity-Based_Local_Coherence_Modelling_Using_Topological_Fields.html">101 acl-2010-Entity-Based Local Coherence Modelling Using Topological Fields</a></p>

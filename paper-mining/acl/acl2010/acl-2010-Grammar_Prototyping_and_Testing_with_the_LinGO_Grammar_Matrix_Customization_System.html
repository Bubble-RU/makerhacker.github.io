</p><p>4 The stored knowledge includes both a cross-linguistic core grammar and a series of “libraries” containing analyses of cross-linguistically variable phenomena. [sent-9, score-0.494]
</p><p>5 The grammars produced are compatible with both the grammar development tools and the 1http://www. [sent-11, score-0.479]
</p><p>6 The grammar framework used is Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Pollard and Sag, 1994) and the grammars map bidirectionally between surface strings and semantic representations in the format of Minimal Recursion Semantics (Copestake et al. [sent-18, score-0.555]
</p><p>7 The Grammar Matrix project has three goals— one engineering and two scientific. [sent-20, score-0.057]
</p><p>8 The engineering goal is to reduce the cost of creating grammars by distilling the solutions developed in existing DELPH-IN grammars and making them easily available for new projects. [sent-21, score-0.321]
</p><p>9 3  typological breadth (handling the known range of realizations of the phenomena analyzed) and analytical depth (producing analyses which work together to map surface strings to semantic representations) (Drellishak, 2009). [sent-23, score-0.303]
</p><p>10 2  System Overview  Grammar customization with the LinGO Grammar Matrix consists of three primary activities: filling out the questionnaire, preliminary testing of the grammar fragment, and grammar creation. [sent-24, score-1.217]
</p><p>11 1 Questionnaire Most ofthe linguistic phenomena supported by the questionnaire vary across languages along multiple dimensions. [sent-26, score-0.422]
</p><p>12 Supporting a linguistic phenomenon, therefore, requires eliciting the answers to such questions from the user. [sent-33, score-0.143]
</p><p>13 The customization system elicits these answers using a detailed, web-based, typological questionnaire, then interprets the answers without human intervention and produces a grammar in the format expected by the LKB (Copestake, 2002), namely TDL (type description language). [sent-34, score-1.233]
</p><p>14 The questionnaire is presented to the user as a series of connected web pages. [sent-36, score-0.524]
</p><p>15 The first page the user sees (the “main page”) contains some introductory text and hyperlinks to direct the user to  other sections of the questionnaire (“subpages”). [sent-37, score-0.696]
</p><p>16 The actual questions in the questionnaire are represented by HTML form fields, including: text fields, check boxes, radio buttons, drop-downs, and multi-select dropdowns. [sent-39, score-0.416]
</p><p>17 The values of these form fields are stored in a “choices file”, which is the object passed on to the grammar customization stage. [sent-40, score-0.911]
</p><p>18 1 Unbounded Content Early versions of the customization system (Bender and Flickinger, 2005; Drellishak and Bender, 2005) only allowed a finite (and small) number of entries for things like lexical types. [sent-43, score-0.556]
</p><p>19 For instance, users were required to provide exactly one transitive verb type and one intransitive verb type. [sent-44, score-0.128]
</p><p>20 The current system has an iterator mechanism in the questionnaire that allows for repeated sections, and thus unlimited entries. [sent-45, score-0.468]
</p><p>21 The utility of the iterator mechanism is most  apparent when filling out the Lexicon subpage. [sent-47, score-0.078]
</p><p>22 Users can create an arbitrary number of lexical rule “slots”, each with an arbitrary number of morphemes which each in turn bear any number of feature constraints. [sent-48, score-0.079]
</p><p>23 For example, the user could create a tense-agreement morphological slot, which contains multiple portmanteau morphemes each expressing some combination of tense, subject person and subject number values (e. [sent-49, score-0.218]
</p><p>24 The ability provided by the iterators to create unbounded content facilitates the creation of substantial grammars through the customization system. [sent-52, score-0.773]
</p><p>25 Furthermore, the system allows users to expand on some iterators while leaving others unspecified, thus modeling complex rule interactions even when it cannot cover features provided by these rules. [sent-53, score-0.18]
</p><p>26 A user can correctly model the morphotactic framework of the language using “skeletal” lexical rules—those that specify morphemes’ forms and their co-occurrence restrictions, but perhaps not their morphosyntactic features. [sent-54, score-0.185]
</p><p>27 The user can then, post-customization, augment these rules  with the missing information. [sent-55, score-0.139]
</p><p>28 2  Dynamic Content  In earlier versions ofthe customization system, the questionnaire was static. [sent-58, score-0.904]
</p><p>29 Not only was the number of form fields static, but the questions were the same, regardless of user input. [sent-59, score-0.206]
</p><p>30 When the user loads the customization system’s main page or subpages, appropriate HTML is created on the fly on the basis of the information already collected from the user as well as language-independent information provided by the system. [sent-61, score-0.83]
</p><p>31 The questionnaire has two kinds of dynamic content: expandable lists for unbounded entry fields, and the population of drop-down selectors. [sent-62, score-0.425]
</p><p>32 The lists in an iterated section can be expanded or shortened with “Add” and “Delete” buttons near the items in question. [sent-63, score-0.049]
</p><p>33 4 These dynamic drop-downs greatly lessen the amount of information the user must remember while filling out the questionnaire and can prevent the user from trying to enter an invalid  value. [sent-65, score-0.725]
</p><p>34 2  Validation  It makes no sense to attempt to create a consistent grammar from an empty questionnaire, an incomplete questionnaire, or a questionnaire containing contradictory answers, so the customization system first sends a user’s answers through “form validation”. [sent-69, score-1.403]
</p><p>35 This component places a set of arbitrarily complex constraints on the answers provided. [sent-70, score-0.069]
</p><p>36 The system insists, for example, that the user not state the language contains no determiners but then provide one in the Lexicon subpage. [sent-71, score-0.218]
</p><p>37 When a question fails form validation, it is marked with a red asterisk in the questionnaire, and ifthe user hovers the mouse cursor over the asterisk, a pop-up message appears describing how form validation failed. [sent-72, score-0.223]
</p><p>38 The validation component  can also produce warnings (marked with red question marks) in cases where the system can generate a grammar from the user’s answers, but we have reason to believe the grammar won’t behave as expected. [sent-73, score-0.721]
</p><p>39 This occurs, for example, when there are no verbal lexical entries provided, yielding a grammar that cannot parse any sentences. [sent-74, score-0.317]
</p><p>40 3 Creating a Grammar After the questionnaire has passed validation, the system enables two more buttons on the main page: “Test by Generation” and “Create Grammar”. [sent-76, score-0.471]
</p><p>41 “Test by Generation” allows the user to test the performance of the current state of the grammar without leaving the browser, and is described in §3. [sent-77, score-0.486]
</p><p>42 “Create Grammar” causes the customizatiino n§ system taot output an LKB-compatible grammar that includes all the types in the core Matrix, along with the types from each library, tailored appropriately, according to the specific answers provided for the language described in the questionnaire. [sent-78, score-0.532]
</p><p>43 4 Summary This section has briefly presented the structure of the customization system. [sent-80, score-0.519]
</p><p>44 , visualization tools to assist with designing type hierarchies and morphotactic dependencies), we believe that this system is sufficiently general to support the addition of analyses of many different linguistic phenomena. [sent-83, score-0.179]
</p><p>45 The system has been used to create starter grammars for more than 40 languages in the contextofagraduate grammarengineering course. [sent-84, score-0.296]
</p><p>46 The students developed these grammars over three weeks using reference materials and the customization system. [sent-86, score-0.651]
</p><p>47 We compare the grammars in terms of the number types they define, as well as the number of lexical rule and  phrase structure rule instances. [sent-87, score-0.169]
</p><p>48 5 We separate types defined in the Matrix core grammar from language-specific types defined by the customization system. [sent-88, score-0.945]
</p><p>49 The Matrix core grammar includes a larger number of types whose function is to provide disjunctions of parts of speech. [sent-90, score-0.389]
</p><p>50 The final column in the table gives the number of “choices” or specifications that the users gave to the customization system in order to derive these grammars. [sent-92, score-0.623]
</p><p>51 3  Test-by-generation  The purpose of the test-by-generation feature is to provide a quick method for testing the grammar compiled from a choices file. [sent-93, score-0.4]
</p><p>52 It accomplishes this by generating sentences the grammar deems grammatical. [sent-94, score-0.317]
</p><p>53 This is useful to the user in two main ways: it quickly shows whether any ungrammatical sentences are being licensed by the grammar  and, by providing  an exhaustive  list of licensed  sentences for an input template, allows users to see if an expected sentence is not being produced. [sent-95, score-0.523]
</p><p>54 It is worth emphasizing that this feature of the customization  system relies on the bidirectional-  ity of the grammars; that is, the fact that the same grammar can be used for both parsing and generation. [sent-96, score-0.873]
</p><p>55 Our experience has shown that grammar developers quickly find generation provides a more stringent test than parsing, especially for the ability of a grammar to model ungrammaticality. [sent-97, score-0.671]
</p><p>56 1 Underspecified MRS Testing by generation takes advantage of the generation algorithm include in the LKB (Carroll et al. [sent-99, score-0.074]
</p><p>57 , 2005): a bag of elementary predications, each bearing features encoding a predicate string, a label, and one or more argument positions that can be filled with variables or with labels of other elementary predications. [sent-107, score-0.131]
</p><p>58 In order to test our starter grammars by generation, therefore, we must provide input MRSs. [sent-109, score-0.223]
</p><p>59 The shared core grammar ensures that all of the grammars produce and interpret valid MRSs, but there are still language-specific properties in these semantic representations. [sent-110, score-0.484]
</p><p>60 Most notably, the predicate strings are user-defined (and languagespecific), as are the variable properties. [sent-111, score-0.168]
</p><p>61 In addition, some coarser-grained typological properties (such as the presence or absence of determiners) lead to differences in the semantic representations. [sent-112, score-0.128]
</p><p>62 Therefore, we cannot simply store a set of MRSs from one grammar to use as input to the generator. [sent-113, score-0.317]
</p><p>63 Instead, we take a set of stored template MRSs and generalize them by removing all variable  properties (allowing the generator to explore all possible values), leaving only the predicate strings and links between the elementary predications. [sent-114, score-0.346]
</p><p>64 We then replace the stored predicate strings with ones selected from among those provided by the user. [sent-115, score-0.17]
</p><p>65 Figure 1a shows an MRS produced by a grammar fragment for English. [sent-116, score-0.379]
</p><p>66 Figure 1b shows the MRS with the variable properties removed and the predicate strings replaced with generic place-holders. [sent-117, score-0.168]
</p><p>67 One such template is needed for every sentence type (e. [sent-118, score-0.066]
</p><p>68 {h hh51, qe2eq, { h7h7}: i#NOUN1#(x4), hh3 h:1#,De2E,T {1h#7(:#xN4, Oh5U, Nh61#),( h1:#VERB#(e2, x4)}, {hh1:5# qeq R hB7}# ie Figure 1{ : Original iand underspecified MRS  negated-intransitive, etc. [sent-124, score-0.089]
</p><p>69 In order to ensure that the generated strings are maximally informative to the user testing a grammar, we take advantage of the lexical type system. [sent-126, score-0.273]
</p><p>70 Because words in lexical types as defined by the customization system differ only in orthography and predicate string, and not in syntactic behavior, we need only consider one word of each type. [sent-127, score-0.652]
</p><p>71 This allows us to focus the range of variation produced by the generator on (a) the differences between lexical types and (b) the variable properties. [sent-128, score-0.141]
</p><p>72 2 Test by generation process The first step of the test-by-generation process is to compile the choices file into a grammar. [sent-130, score-0.12]
</p><p>73 Next, a copy of the LKB is initialized on the web server that is hosting the Matrix system, and the newlycreated grammar is loaded into this LKB session. [sent-131, score-0.317]
</p><p>74 For  nouns and determiners, the choices file is searched for the predicate for one noun of each lexical noun type, all of the determiner predicates, and whether or not each noun type needs a determiner or not. [sent-134, score-0.172]
</p><p>75 For verbs, the process is more complicated, requiring valence information as well as predicate strings in order to select the correct MRS template. [sent-135, score-0.131]
</p><p>76 In order to get this information, the process traverses the type hierarchy above the verbal lexical types until it finds a type that gives valence information about the verb. [sent-136, score-0.097]
</p><p>77 The test-by-generation process then sends these constructed MRSs to the LKB process and displays the generation results, along with a brief explanation of the input semantics that gave rise to them, in HTML for the user. [sent-138, score-0.077]
</p><p>78 7 4  Related Work  As stated above, the engineering goal of the Grammar Matrix is to facilitate the rapid development of large-scale precision grammars. [sent-139, score-0.091]
</p><p>79 The starter  grammars output by the customization system are compatible in format and semantic representations with existing DELPH-IN tools, including software for grammar development and for applications including machine translation (Oepen et al. [sent-140, score-1.13]
</p><p>80 More broadly, the Grammar Matrix is situated in the field of multilingual grammar engineering, or the practice of developing linguisticallymotivated grammars for multiple languages within a consistent framework. [sent-142, score-0.449]
</p><p>81 To our knowledge, however, there is only one other system that elicits typological information about a language and outputs an appropriately customized implemented grammar. [sent-148, score-0.266]
</p><p>82 Accordingly, the output of PAWS consists ofboth a prose descriptive grammar 7This set-up scales well to multiple users, as the user’s interaction with the LKB is done once per customized grammar, providing output for the user to peruse as his or her leisure. [sent-151, score-0.537]
</p><p>83 The LKB process does not persist, but can be started again by reinvoking test-by-generation, such as when the user has updated the grammar definition. [sent-152, score-0.456]
</p><p>84 The latter is in the format required by PC-PATR (McConnel, 1995), and is used primarily to disambiguate morphological analyses of lexical items in the input string. [sent-161, score-0.1]
</p><p>85 Other systems that attempt to elicit linguistic information from a user include the Expedition (McShane and Nirenburg, 2003) and Avenue projects (Monson et al. [sent-162, score-0.169]
</p><p>86 These projects differ from the Grammar Matrix customization system in eliciting information from native speakers (such as paradigms or translations of specifically tailored corpora), rather than linguists. [sent-164, score-0.629]
</p><p>87 Further, unlike the Grammar Matrix customization system, they do not produce resources meant to sustain further development by a linguist. [sent-165, score-0.519]
</p><p>88 5  Demonstration Plan  Our demonstration illustrates how the customization system can be used to create starter grammars and test them by invoking test-by-generation. [sent-166, score-0.856]
</p><p>89 We first walk through the questionnaire to illustrate the functionality of libraries and the way that the user interacts with the system to enter information. [sent-167, score-0.632]
</p><p>90 Then, using a sample grammar for English, we demonstrate how test-by-generation can expose both overgeneration (ungrammatical generated strings) and undergeneration (gaps in generated paradigms). [sent-168, score-0.317]
</p><p>91 Finally, we return to the questionnaire to address the bugs in the sample grammar and retest to show the result. [sent-169, score-0.702]
</p><p>92 6  Conclusion  This paper has presented an overview of the LinGO Grammar Matrix Customization System, highlighting the ways in which it provides access to its repository of linguistic knowledge. [sent-170, score-0.049]
</p><p>93 The current customization system covers a sufficiently wide range of phenomena that the grammars it produces are non-trivial. [sent-171, score-0.725]
</p><p>94 In addition, it is not always apparent to a user what the implications will be of selecting various options in the questionnaire, nor how analyses of different phenomena will interact. [sent-172, score-0.242]
</p><p>95 The test-by-generation methodology allows users to interactively explore the consequences of different linguistic analyses within the platform. [sent-173, score-0.133]
</p><p>96 We anticipate that it will, as a result, encourage users to develop more complex grammars within the customization system (before moving on to hand-editing) and thereby gain more benefit. [sent-174, score-0.755]

<p>Author: Tomoharu Iwata ; Daichi Mochihashi ; Hiroshi Sawada</p><p>Abstract: We propose a corpus-based probabilistic framework to extract hidden common syntax across languages from non-parallel multilingual corpora in an unsupervised fashion. For this purpose, we assume a generative model for multilingual corpora, where each sentence is generated from a language dependent probabilistic contextfree grammar (PCFG), and these PCFGs are generated from a prior grammar that is common across languages. We also develop a variational method for efficient inference. Experiments on a non-parallel multilingual corpus of eleven languages demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.</p><p>4 0.085423104 <a title="128-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Rebanking_CCGbank_for_Improved_NP_Interpretation.html">203 acl-2010-Rebanking CCGbank for Improved NP Interpretation</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Honnibal ; James R.

Instead, separate resources are created to address such problems. In this paper we show how to improve the quality of a treebank, by integrating resources and implementing improved analyses for specific constructions. We demonstrate this rebanking process by creating an updated version of CCGbank that includes the predicate-argument structure of both verbs and nouns, baseNP brackets, verb-particle constructions, and restrictive and non-restrictive nominal modifiers; and evaluate the impact of these changes on a statistical parser.</p><p>5 0.083843157 <a title="128-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Simple%2C_Accurate_Parsing_with_an_All-Fragments_Grammar.html">211 acl-2010-Simple, Accurate Parsing with an All-Fragments Grammar</a></p>

We parse with all fragments of the training set, in contrast to much recent work on tree selection in data-oriented parsing and treesubstitution grammar learning.

Moreover, our parser requires no explicit lexicon machinery, instead parsing input sentences as character streams. Despite its simplicity, our parser achieves accuracies of over 88% F1 on the standard English WSJ task, which is competitive with substantially more complicated state-of-theart lexicalized and latent-variable parsers. Additional specific contributions center on making implicit all-fragments parsing efficient, including a coarse-to-fine inference scheme and a new graph encoding.</p><p>6 0.083161913 <a title="128-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Tools_for_Multilingual_Grammar-Based_Translation_on_the_Web.html">235 acl-2010-Tools for Multilingual Grammar-Based Translation on the Web</a></p>

<p>Author: Aarne Ranta ; Krasimir Angelov ; Thomas Hallgren</p><p>Abstract: This is a system demo for a set of tools for translating texts between multiple languages in real time with high quality. The translation works on restricted languages, and is based on semantic interlinguas. The underlying model is GF (Grammatical Framework), which is an open-source toolkit for multilingual grammar implementations. The demo will cover up to 20 parallel languages. Two related sets of tools are presented: grammarian’s tools helping to build translators for new domains and languages, and translator’s tools helping to translate documents. The grammarian’s tools are designed to make it easy to port the technique to new applications. The translator’s tools are essential in the restricted language context, enabling the author to remain in the fragments recognized by the system. The tools that are demonstrated will be ap- plied and developed further in the European project MOLTO (Multilingual On-Line Translation) which has started in March 2010 and runs for three years. 1 Translation Needs for the Web The best-known translation tools on the web are Google translate1 and Systran2. They are targeted to consumers of web documents: users who want to find out what a given document is about. For this purpose, browsing quality is sufficient, since the user has intelligence and good will, and understands that she uses the translation at her own risk. Since Google and Systran translations can be grammatically and semantically flawed, they don’t reach publication quality, and cannot hence be used by the producers of web documents. For instance, the provider of an e-commerce site cannot take the risk that the product descriptions or selling conditions have errors that change the original intentions. There are very few automatic translation systems actually in use for producers of information. As already 1www .google . com/t rans l e at 2www. systransoft . com noted by Bar-Hillel (1964), machine translation is one of those AI-complete tasks that involves a trade-off between coverage and precision, and the current mainstream systems opt for coverage. This is also what web users expect: they want to be able to throw just anything at the translation system and get something useful back. Precision-oriented approaches, the prime example of which is METEO (Chandioux 1977), have not been popular in recent years. However, from the producer’s point of view, large coverage is not essential: unlike the consumer’s tools, their input is predictable, and can be restricted to very specific domains, and to content that the producers themselves are creating in the first place. But even in such tasks, two severe problems remain: • • The development cost problem: a large amount oTfh ew dorekv eisl onpemedeendt f coors building tmra:n asl laatorgrse afomr new domains and new languages. The authoring problem: since the method does nTohte ew aourkth foorri nalgl input, etmhe: :asu tihnocer othfe eth me source toexest of translation may need special training to write in a way that can be translated at all. These two problems have probably been the main obstacles to making high-quality restricted language translation more wide-spread in tasks where it would otherwise be applicable. We address these problems by providing tools that help developers of translation systems on the one hand, and authors and translators—i.e. the users of the systems—on the other. In the MOLTO project (Multilingual On-Line Translation)3, we have the goal to improve both the development and use of restricted language translation by an order of magnitude, as compared with the state of the art. As for development costs, this means that a system for many languages and with adequate quality can be built in a matter of days rather than months. As for authoring, this means that content production does not require the use of manuals or involve trial and error, both of which can easily make the work ten times slower than normal writing. In the proposed system demo, we will show how some of the building blocks for MOLTO can already now be used in web-based translators, although on a 3 www.molto-project .eu 66 UppsalaP,r Sowceeeddenin,g 1s3 o Jfu tlhye 2 A0C1L0. 2 ?c 01200 S1y0s Atesmso Dcieamtioonns ftorart Cioonms,p puatagteiso 6n6a–l7 L1in,guistics Figure 1: A multilingual GF grammar with reversible mappings from a common abstract syntax to the 15 languages currently available in the GF Resource Grammar Library. smaller scale as regards languages and application domains. A running demo system is available at http : / / grammat i cal framework .org : 4 1 9 6. 2 2 Multilingual Grammars The translation tools are based on GF, Grammatical Framework4 (Ranta 2004). GF is a grammar formalism—that is, a mathematical model of natural language, equipped with a formal notation for writing grammars and a computer program implementing parsing and generation which are declaratively defined by grammars. Thus GF is comparable with formalism such as HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1994), LFG (Bresnan 1982) or TAG (Joshi 1985). The novel feature of GF is the notion of multilingual grammars, which describe several languages simultaneously by using a common representation called abstract syntax; see Figure 1. In a multilingual GF grammar, meaning-preserving translation is provided as a composition of parsing and generation via the abstract syntax, which works as an interlingua. This model of translation is different from approaches based on other comparable grammar formalisms, such as synchronous TAGs (Shieber and Schabes 1990), Pargram (Butt & al. 2002, based on LFG), LINGO Matrix (Bender and Flickinger 2005, based on HPSG), and CLE (Core Language Engine, Alshawi 1992). These approaches use transfer rules between individual languages, separate for each pair of languages. Being interlingua-based, GF translation scales up linearly to new languages without the quadratic blowup of transfer-based systems. In transfer-based sys- 4www.grammaticalframework.org tems, as many as n(n − 1) components (transfer functtieomnss), are naeneyde ads nto( cover a)l cl language pairs nisnf bero tfhu ndci-rections. In an interlingua-based system, 2n + 1components are enough: the interlingua itself, plus translations in both directions between each language and the interlingua. However, in GF, n + 1 components are sufficient, because the mappings from the abstract syntax to each language (the concrete syntaxes) are reversible, i.e. usable for both generation and parsing. Multilingual GF grammars can be seen as an implementation of Curry’s distinction between tectogrammatical and phenogrammatical structure (Curry 1961). In GF, the tectogrammatical structure is called abstract syntax, following standard computer science terminology. It is defined by using a logical framework (Harper & al. 1993), whose mathematical basis is in the type theory of Martin-L o¨f (1984). Two things can be noted about this architecture, both showing im- provements over state-of-the-art grammar-based translation methods. First, the translation interlingua (the abstract syntax) is a powerful logical formalism, able to express semantical structures such as context-dependencies and anaphora (Ranta 1994). In particular, dependent types make it more expressive than the type theory used in Montague grammar (Montague 1974) and employed in the Rosetta translation project (Rosetta 1998). Second, GF uses a framework for interlinguas, rather than one universal interlingua. This makes the interlingual approach more light-weight and feasible than in systems assuming one universal interlingua, such as Rosetta and UNL, Universal Networking Language5 . It also gives more precision to special-purpose translation: the interlingua of a GF translation system (i.e. the abstract syntax of a multilingual grammar) can encode precisely those structures and distinctions that are relevant for the task at hand. Thus an interlingua for mathematical proofs (Hallgren and Ranta 2000) is different from one for commands for operating an MP3 player (Perera and Ranta 2007). The expressive power of the logical framework is sufficient for both kinds of tasks. One important source of inspiration for GF was the WYSIWYM system (Power and Scott 1998), which used domain-specific interlinguas and produced excellent quality in multilingual generation. But the generation components were hard-coded in the program, instead of being defined declaratively as in GF, and they were not usable in the direction of parsing. 3 Grammars and Ontologies Parallel to the first development efforts of GF in the late 1990’s, another framework idea was emerging in web technology: XML, Extensible Mark-up Language, which unlike HTML is not a single mark-up language but a framework for creating custom mark-up lan5www .undl .org 67 guages. The analogy between GF and XML was seen from the beginning, and GF was designed as a formalism for multilingual rendering of semantic content (Dymetman and al. 2000). XML originated as a format for structuring documents and structured data serialization, but a couple ofits descendants, RDF(S) and OWL, developed its potential to formally express the semantics of data and content, serving as the fundaments of the emerging Semantic Web. Practically any meaning representation format can be converted into GF’s abstract syntax, which can then be mapped to different target languages. In particular the OWL language can be seen as a syntactic sugar for a subset of Martin-L o¨f’s type theory so it is trivial to embed it in GF’s abstract syntax. The translation problem defined in terms of an ontology is radically different from the problem of translating plain text from one language to another. Many of the projects in which GF has been used involve precisely this: a meaning representation formalized as GF abstract syntax. Some projects build on previously existing meaning representation and address mathematical proofs (Hallgren and Ranta 2000), software specifications (Beckert & al. 2007), and mathematical exercises (the European project WebALT6). Other projects start with semantic modelling work to build meaning representations from scratch, most notably ones for dialogue systems (Perera and Ranta 2007) in the European project TALK7. Yet another project, and one closest to web translation, is the multilingual Wiki system presented in (Meza Moreno and Bringert 2008). In this system, users can add and modify reviews of restaurants in three languages (English, Spanish, and Swedish). Any change made in any of the languages gets automatically translated to the other languages. To take an example, the OWL-to-GF mapping trans- lates OWL’s classes to GF’s categories and OWL’s properties to GF’s functions that return propositions. As a running example in this and the next section, we will use the class of integers and the two-place property of being divisible (“x is divisible by y”). The correspondences are as follows: Clas s (pp : intege r . . . ) m catm integer Ob j e ctP roperty ( pp :div domain (pp : int ege r ) range ( pp :integer ) ) m funm div : int eger -> 4 int ege r -> prop Grammar Engineer’s Tools In the GF setting, building a multilingual translation system is equivalent to building a multilingual GF 6EDC-22253, webalt .math .he l inki . fi s 7IST-507802, 2004–2006, www .t alk-pro j e ct .org grammar, which in turn consists of two kinds of components: • a language-independent abstract syntax, giving tahe l snegmuaangtei-ci nmdeopdeenl dveinat tw ahbisctrha ctrtan ssylnattiaoxn, gisi performed; • for each language, a concrete syntax mapping abfstorrac eta syntax turaegese ,t oa strings ien s tyhnatta language. While abstract syntax construction is an extra task compared to many other kinds of translation methods, it is technically relatively simple, and its cost is moreover amortized as the system is extended to new languages. Concrete syntax construction can be much more demanding in terms of programming skills and linguistic knowledge, due to the complexity of natural languages. This task is where GF claims perhaps the highest advantage over other approaches to special-purpose grammars. The two main assets are: • • Programming language support: GF is a modern fPuroncgtriaomnaml programming language, w isith a a powerful type system and module system supporting modular and collaborative programming and reuse of code.

To give an example of what the library provides, let us first consider the inflectional morphology. It is presented as a set of lexicon-building functions such as, in English, mkV : St r -> V i.e. function mkV, which takes a string (St r) as its argument and returns a verb (V) as its value. The verb is, internally, an inflection table containing all forms of a verb. The function mkV derives all these forms from its argument string, which is the infinitive form. It predicts all regular variations: (mkV</p><p>3 0.60317063 <a title="128-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-Wide-Coverage_NLP_with_Linguistically_Expressive_Grammars.html">260 acl-2010-Wide-Coverage NLP with Linguistically Expressive Grammars</a></p>

<p>Author: Sylvain Schmitz</p><p>Abstract: Dominance links were introduced in grammars to model long distance scrambling phenomena, motivating the definition of multiset-valued linear indexed grammars (MLIGs) by Rambow (1994b), and inspiring quite a few recent formalisms. It turns out that MLIGs have since been rediscovered and reused in a variety of contexts, and that the complexity of their emptiness problem has become the key to several open questions in computer science. We survey complexity results and open issues on MLIGs and related formalisms, and provide new complexity bounds for some linguistically motivated restrictions.</p><p>5 0.50656176 <a title="128-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Learning_Common_Grammar_from_Multilingual_Corpus.html">162 acl-2010-Learning Common Grammar from Multilingual Corpus</a></p>

For this purpose, we assume a generative model for multilingual corpora, where each sentence is generated from a language dependent probabilistic contextfree grammar (PCFG), and these PCFGs are generated from a prior grammar that is common across languages. We also develop a variational method for efficient inference. Experiments on a non-parallel multilingual corpus of eleven languages demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.</p><p>6 0.49513286 <a title="128-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Computing_Weakest_Readings.html">67 acl-2010-Computing Weakest Readings</a></p>

We describe the implementation of this repository with an emphasis on how the information is made available to users, including in-browser testing capabilities.</p><p>3 0.7287364 <a title="128-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-The_Impact_of_Interpretation_Problems_on_Tutorial_Dialogue.html">227 acl-2010-The Impact of Interpretation Problems on Tutorial Dialogue</a></p>
<p>Author: Myroslava O. Dzikovska ; Johanna D. Moore ; Natalie Steinhauser ; Gwendolyn Campbell</p><p>Abstract: Supporting natural language input may improve learning in intelligent tutoring systems. However, interpretation errors are unavoidable and require an effective recovery policy. We describe an evaluation of an error recovery policy in the BEETLE II tutorial dialogue system and discuss how different types of interpretation problems affect learning gain and user satisfaction. In particular, the problems arising from student use of non-standard terminology appear to have negative consequences. We argue that existing strategies for dealing with terminology problems are insufficient and that improving such strategies is important in future ITS research.</p><p>4 0.5511595 <a title="128-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Simple%2C_Accurate_Parsing_with_an_All-Fragments_Grammar.html">211 acl-2010-Simple, Accurate Parsing with an All-Fragments Grammar</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohit Bansal ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple but accurate parser which exploits both large tree fragments and symbol refinement. We parse with all fragments of the training set, in contrast to much recent work on tree selection in data-oriented parsing and treesubstitution grammar learning. We require only simple, deterministic grammar symbol refinement, in contrast to recent work on latent symbol refinement. Moreover, our parser requires no explicit lexicon machinery, instead parsing input sentences as character streams. Despite its simplicity, our parser achieves accuracies of over 88% F1 on the standard English WSJ task, which is competitive with substantially more complicated state-of-theart lexicalized and latent-variable parsers. Additional specific contributions center on making implicit all-fragments parsing efficient, including a coarse-to-fine inference scheme and a new graph encoding.</p><p>5 0.54606205 <a title="128-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Convolution_Kernel_over_Packed_Parse_Forest.html">71 acl-2010-Convolution Kernel over Packed Parse Forest</a></p>
<p>Author: Min Zhang ; Hui Zhang ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a convolution forest kernel to effectively explore rich structured features embedded in a packed parse forest. As opposed to the convolution tree kernel, the proposed forest kernel does not have to commit to a single best parse tree, is thus able to explore very large object spaces and much more structured features embedded in a forest. This makes the proposed kernel more robust against parsing errors and data sparseness issues than the convolution tree kernel. The paper presents the formal definition of convolution forest kernel and also illustrates the computing algorithm to fast compute the proposed convolution forest kernel. Experimental results on two NLP applications, relation extraction and semantic role labeling, show that the proposed forest kernel significantly outperforms the baseline of the convolution tree kernel. 1</p><p>6 0.53433424 <a title="128-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Learning_to_Translate_with_Source_and_Target_Syntax.html">169 acl-2010-Learning to Translate with Source and Target Syntax</a></p>

<p>Author: Jason Riesa ; Daniel Marcu</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple yet powerful hierarchical search algorithm for automatic word alignment. Our algorithm induces a forest of alignments from which we can efficiently extract a ranked k-best list. We score a given alignment within the forest with a flexible, linear discriminative model incorporating hundreds of features, and trained on a relatively small amount of annotated data. We report results on Arabic-English word alignment and translation tasks. Our model outperforms a GIZA++ Model-4 baseline by 6.3 points in F-measure, yielding a 1.1 BLEU score increase over a state-of-the-art syntax-based machine translation system.</p><p>4 0.24387896 <a title="265-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Constituency_to_Dependency_Translation_with_Forests.html">69 acl-2010-Constituency to Dependency Translation with Forests</a></p>
<p>Author: Haitao Mi ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: Tree-to-string systems (and their forestbased extensions) have gained steady popularity thanks to their simplicity and efficiency, but there is a major limitation: they are unable to guarantee the grammaticality of the output, which is explicitly modeled in string-to-tree systems via targetside syntax. We thus propose to combine the advantages of both, and present a novel constituency-to-dependency translation model, which uses constituency forests on the source side to direct the translation, and dependency trees on the target side (as a language model) to ensure grammaticality. Medium-scale experiments show an absolute and statistically significant improvement of +0.7 BLEU points over a state-of-the-art forest-based tree-to-string system even with fewer rules. This is also the first time that a treeto-tree model can surpass tree-to-string counterparts.</p><p>5 0.2029119 <a title="265-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Convolution_Kernel_over_Packed_Parse_Forest.html">71 acl-2010-Convolution Kernel over Packed Parse Forest</a></p>
<p>Author: Min Zhang ; Hui Zhang ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a convolution forest kernel to effectively explore rich structured features embedded in a packed parse forest. As opposed to the convolution tree kernel, the proposed forest kernel does not have to commit to a single best parse tree, is thus able to explore very large object spaces and much more structured features embedded in a forest. This makes the proposed kernel more robust against parsing errors and data sparseness issues than the convolution tree kernel. The paper presents the formal definition of convolution forest kernel and also illustrates the computing algorithm to fast compute the proposed convolution forest kernel. Experimental results on two NLP applications, relation extraction and semantic role labeling, show that the proposed forest kernel significantly outperforms the baseline of the convolution tree kernel. 1</p><p>6 0.17926903 <a title="265-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Fine-Grained_Tree-to-String_Translation_Rule_Extraction.html">118 acl-2010-Fine-Grained Tree-to-String Translation Rule Extraction</a></p>

<p>Author: Xianchao Wu ; Takuya Matsuzaki ; Jun'ichi Tsujii</p><p>Abstract: Tree-to-string translation rules are widely used in linguistically syntax-based statistical machine translation systems. In this paper, we propose to use deep syntactic information for obtaining fine-grained translation rules. A head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) parser is used to obtain the deep syntactic information, which includes a fine-grained description of the syntactic property and a semantic representation of a sentence. We extract fine-grained rules from aligned HPSG tree/forest-string pairs and use them in our tree-to-string and string-to-tree systems. Extensive experiments on largescale bidirectional Japanese-English trans- lations testified the effectiveness of our approach.</p><p>5 0.53518069 <a title="265-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Boosting-Based_System_Combination_for_Machine_Translation.html">54 acl-2010-Boosting-Based System Combination for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Xiao ; Jingbo Zhu ; Muhua Zhu ; Huizhen Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a simple and effective method to address the issue of how to generate diversified translation systems from a single Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) engine for system combination. Our method is based on the framework of boosting. First, a sequence of weak translation systems is generated from a baseline system in an iterative manner. Then, a strong translation system is built from the ensemble of these weak translation systems. To adapt boosting to SMT system combination, several key components of the original boosting algorithms are redesigned in this work. We evaluate our method on Chinese-to-English Machine Translation (MT) tasks in three baseline systems, including a phrase-based system, a hierarchical phrasebased system and a syntax-based system. The experimental results on three NIST evaluation test sets show that our method leads to significant improvements in translation accuracy over the baseline systems. 1</p><p>6 0.51439744 <a title="265-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Hindi-to-Urdu_Machine_Translation_through_Transliteration.html">135 acl-2010-Hindi-to-Urdu Machine Translation through Transliteration</a></p>

<p>Author: John DeNero ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We present a discriminative model that directly predicts which set ofphrasal translation rules should be extracted from a sentence pair. Our model scores extraction sets: nested collections of all the overlapping phrase pairs consistent with an underlying word alignment. Extraction set models provide two principle advantages over word-factored alignment models. First, we can incorporate features on phrase pairs, in addition to word links. Second, we can optimize for an extraction-based loss function that relates directly to the end task of generating translations. Our model gives improvements in alignment quality relative to state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised baselines, as well as providing up to a 1.4 improvement in BLEU score in Chinese-to-English translation experiments.</p><p>3 0.65824527 <a title="265-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Tree-Based_and_Forest-Based_Translation.html">243 acl-2010-Tree-Based and Forest-Based Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Lei Cui ; Dongdong Zhang ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou ; Tiejun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: In hierarchical phrase-based SMT systems, statistical models are integrated to guide the hierarchical rule selection for better translation performance. Previous work mainly focused on the selection of either the source side of a hierarchical rule or the target side of a hierarchical rule rather than considering both of them simultaneously. This paper presents a joint model to predict the selection of hierarchical rules. The proposed model is estimated based on four sub-models where the rich context knowledge from both source and target sides is leveraged. Our method can be easily incorporated into the practical SMT systems with the log-linear model framework. The experimental results show that our method can yield significant improvements in performance.</p><p>5 0.65034032 <a title="265-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-A_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation_Method_for_Selectional_Preferences.html">10 acl-2010-A Latent Dirichlet Allocation Method for Selectional Preferences</a></p>
<p>Author: Alan Ritter ; Mausam Mausam ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: The computation of selectional preferences, the admissible argument values for a relation, is a well-known NLP task with broad applicability. We present LDA-SP, which utilizes LinkLDA (Erosheva et al., 2004) to model selectional preferences. By simultaneously inferring latent topics and topic distributions over relations, LDA-SP combines the benefits of previous approaches: like traditional classbased approaches, it produces humaninterpretable classes describing each relation’s preferences, but it is competitive with non-class-based methods in predictive power. We compare LDA-SP to several state-ofthe-art methods achieving an 85% increase in recall at 0.9 precision over mutual information (Erk, 2007). We also evaluate LDA-SP’s effectiveness at filtering improper applications of inference rules, where we show substantial improvement over Pantel et al. ’s system (Pantel et al., 2007).</p><p>6 0.64823389 <a title="265-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-SVD_and_Clustering_for_Unsupervised_POS_Tagging.html">205 acl-2010-SVD and Clustering for Unsupervised POS Tagging</a></p>

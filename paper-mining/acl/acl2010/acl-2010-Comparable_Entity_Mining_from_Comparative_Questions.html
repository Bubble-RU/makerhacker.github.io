<p>Author: Taniya Mishra ; Srinivas Bangalore</p><p>Abstract: The Deep Web is the collection of information repositories that are not indexed by search engines. These repositories are typically accessible through web forms and contain dynamically changing information.

<p>Author: Jia Wang ; Qing Li ; Yuanzhu Peter Chen ; Zhangxi Lin</p><p>Abstract: The variety of engaging interactions among users in social medial distinguishes it from traditional Web media. Such a feature should be utilized while attempting to provide intelligent services to social media participants. In this article, we present a framework to recommend relevant information in Internet forums and blogs using user comments, one of the most representative of user behaviors in online discussion. When incorporating user comments, we consider structural, semantic, and authority information carried by them. One of the most important observation from this work is that semantic contents of user comments can play a fairly different role in a different form of social media. When designing a recommendation system for this purpose, such a difference must be considered with caution.</p><p>4 0.093539707 <a title="63-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-An_Entity-Level_Approach_to_Information_Extraction.html">28 acl-2010-An Entity-Level Approach to Information Extraction</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiao-Li Li ; Lei Zhang ; Bing Liu ; See-Kiong Ng</p><p>Abstract: Distributional similarity is a classic technique for entity set expansion, where the system is given a set of seed entities of a particular class, and is asked to expand the set using a corpus to obtain more entities of the same class as represented by the seeds. This paper shows that a machine learning model called positive and unlabeled learning (PU learning) can model the set expansion problem better. Based on the test results of 10 corpora, we show that a PU learning technique outperformed distributional similarity significantly. 1</p><p>6 0.082932204 <a title="63-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Inducing_Domain-Specific_Semantic_Class_Taggers_from_%28Almost%29_Nothing.html">150 acl-2010-Inducing Domain-Specific Semantic Class Taggers from (Almost) Nothing</a></p>

<p>Author: Yun-Cheng Ju ; Tim Paek</p><p>Abstract: Speech recognition affords automobile drivers a hands-free, eyes-free method of replying to Short Message Service (SMS) text messages. Although a voice search approach based on template matching has been shown to be more robust to the challenging acoustic environment of automobiles than using dictation, users may have difficulties verifying whether SMS response templates match their intended meaning, especially while driving. Using a high-fidelity driving simulator, we compared dictation for SMS replies versus voice search in increasingly difficult driving conditions. Although the two approaches did not differ in terms of driving performance measures, users made about six times more errors on average using dictation than voice search. 1</p><p>5 0.49904507 <a title="63-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Extracting_Sequences_from_the_Web.html">111 acl-2010-Extracting Sequences from the Web</a></p>

<p>Author: Daria Bogdanova</p><p>Abstract: Various text mining algorithms require the process offeature selection. High-level semantically rich features, such as figurative language uses, speech errors etc., are very promising for such problems as e.g. writing style detection, but automatic extraction of such features is a big challenge. In this paper, we propose a framework for figurative language use detection. This framework is based on the idea of sense differentiation. We describe two algorithms illustrating the mentioned idea. We show then how these algorithms work by applying them to Russian language data.</p><p>3 0.89706361 <a title="63-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-WebLicht%3A_Web-Based_LRT_Services_for_German.html">259 acl-2010-WebLicht: Web-Based LRT Services for German</a></p>
<p>Author: Erhard Hinrichs ; Marie Hinrichs ; Thomas Zastrow</p><p>Abstract: This software demonstration presents WebLicht (short for: Web-Based Linguistic Chaining Tool), a webbased service environment for the integration and use of language resources and tools (LRT). WebLicht is being developed as part of the D-SPIN project1. WebLicht is implemented as a web application so that there is no need for users to install any software on their own computers or to concern themselves with the technical details involved in building tool chains. The integrated web services are part of a prototypical infrastructure that was developed to facilitate chaining of LRT services. WebLicht allows the integration and use of distributed web services with standardized APIs. The nature of these open and standardized APIs makes it possible to access the web services from nearly any programming language, shell script or workflow engine (UIMA, Gate etc.) Additionally, an application for integration of additional services is available, allowing anyone to contribute his own web service. 1</p><p>4 0.83362806 <a title="63-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Identifying_Generic_Noun_Phrases.html">139 acl-2010-Identifying Generic Noun Phrases</a></p>
<p>Author: Nils Reiter ; Anette Frank</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a supervised approach for identifying generic noun phrases in context. Generic statements express rulelike knowledge about kinds or events. Therefore, their identification is important for the automatic construction of knowledge bases. In particular, the distinction between generic and non-generic statements is crucial for the correct encoding of generic and instance-level information. Generic expressions have been studied extensively in formal semantics. Building on this work, we explore a corpus-based learning approach for identifying generic NPs, using selections of linguistically motivated features. Our results perform well above the baseline and existing prior work.</p><p>5 0.76368093 <a title="63-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-A_Transition-Based_Parser_for_2-Planar_Dependency_Structures.html">20 acl-2010-A Transition-Based Parser for 2-Planar Dependency Structures</a></p>
<p>Author: Carlos Gomez-Rodriguez ; Joakim Nivre</p><p>Abstract: Finding a class of structures that is rich enough for adequate linguistic representation yet restricted enough for efficient computational processing is an important problem for dependency parsing. In this paper, we present a transition system for 2-planar dependency trees trees that can be decomposed into at most two planar graphs and show that it can be used to implement a classifier-based parser that runs in linear time and outperforms a stateof-the-art transition-based parser on four data sets from the CoNLL-X shared task. In addition, we present an efficient method – – for determining whether an arbitrary tree is 2-planar and show that 99% or more of the trees in existing treebanks are 2-planar.</p><p>6 0.65837651 <a title="63-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Untangling_the_Cross-Lingual_Link_Structure_of_Wikipedia.html">250 acl-2010-Untangling the Cross-Lingual Link Structure of Wikipedia</a></p>

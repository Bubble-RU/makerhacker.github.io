<p>Author: Trevor Cohn ; Phil Blunsom</p><p>Abstract: Learning a tree substitution grammar is very challenging due to derivational ambiguity. Our recent approach used a Bayesian non-parametric model to induce good derivations from treebanked input (Cohn et al., 2009), biasing towards small grammars composed of small generalisable productions. In this paper we present a novel training method for the model using a blocked Metropolis-Hastings sampler in place of the previous method’s local Gibbs sampler. The blocked sampler makes considerably larger moves than the local sampler and consequently con- verges in less time. A core component of the algorithm is a grammar transformation which represents an infinite tree substitution grammar in a finite context free grammar. This enables efficient blocked inference for training and also improves the parsing algorithm. Both algorithms are shown to improve parsing accuracy.</p><p>3 0.082737215 <a title="12-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Semantics-Driven_Shallow_Parsing_for_Chinese_Semantic_Role_Labeling.html">207 acl-2010-Semantics-Driven Shallow Parsing for Chinese Semantic Role Labeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Weiwei Sun</p><p>Abstract: One deficiency of current shallow parsing based Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) methods is that syntactic chunks are too small to effectively group words. To partially resolve this problem, we propose semantics-driven shallow parsing, which takes into account both syntactic structures and predicate-argument structures. We also introduce several new “path” features to improve shallow parsing based SRL method. Experiments indicate that our new method obtains a significant improvement over the best reported Chinese SRL result.</p><p>4 0.07455267 <a title="12-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Accurate_Context-Free_Parsing_with_Combinatory_Categorial_Grammar.html">23 acl-2010-Accurate Context-Free Parsing with Combinatory Categorial Grammar</a></p>
<p>Author: Timothy A. D. Fowler ; Gerald Penn</p><p>Abstract: The definition of combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) in the literature varies quite a bit from author to author. However, the differences between the definitions are important in terms of the language classes of each CCG. We prove that a wide range of CCGs are strongly context-free, including the CCG of CCGbank and of the parser of Clark and Curran (2007). In light of these new results, we train the PCFG parser of Petrov and Klein (2007) on CCGbank and achieve state of the art results in supertagging accuracy, PARSEVAL measures and dependency accuracy.</p><p>5 0.070024095 <a title="12-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-The_Importance_of_Rule_Restrictions_in_CCG.html">228 acl-2010-The Importance of Rule Restrictions in CCG</a></p>
<p>Author: Marco Kuhlmann ; Alexander Koller ; Giorgio Satta</p><p>Abstract: Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) is generally construed as a fully lexicalized formalism, where all grammars use one and the same universal set of rules, and crosslinguistic variation is isolated in the lexicon. In this paper, we show that the weak generative capacity of this ‘pure’ form of CCG is strictly smaller than that of CCG with grammar-specific rules, and of other mildly context-sensitive grammar formalisms, including Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG). Our result also carries over to a multi-modal extension of CCG.</p><p>6 0.064635321 <a title="12-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Profiting_from_Mark-Up%3A_Hyper-Text_Annotations_for_Guided_Parsing.html">200 acl-2010-Profiting from Mark-Up: Hyper-Text Annotations for Guided Parsing</a></p>

<p>Author: Jonathan K. Kummerfeld ; Jessika Roesner ; Tim Dawborn ; James Haggerty ; James R. Curran ; Stephen Clark</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel self-training method for a parser which uses a lexicalised grammar and supertagger, focusing on increasing the speed of the parser rather than its accuracy. The idea is to train the supertagger on large amounts of parser output, so that the supertagger can learn to supply the supertags that the parser will eventually choose as part of the highestscoring derivation. Since the supertagger supplies fewer supertags overall, the parsing speed is increased. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method using a CCG supertagger and parser, obtain- ing significant speed increases on newspaper text with no loss in accuracy. We also show that the method can be used to adapt the CCG parser to new domains, obtaining accuracy and speed improvements for Wikipedia and biomedical text.</p><p>3 0.61392719 <a title="12-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-Accurate_Context-Free_Parsing_with_Combinatory_Categorial_Grammar.html">23 acl-2010-Accurate Context-Free Parsing with Combinatory Categorial Grammar</a></p>

<p>Author: Liang Huang ; Kenji Sagae</p><p>Abstract: Incremental parsing techniques such as shift-reduce have gained popularity thanks to their efficiency, but there remains a major problem: the search is greedy and only explores a tiny fraction of the whole space (even with beam search) as opposed to dynamic programming. We show that, surprisingly, dynamic programming is in fact possible for many shift-reduce parsers, by merging “equivalent” stacks based on feature values. Empirically, our algorithm yields up to a five-fold speedup over a state-of-the-art shift-reduce depen- dency parser with no loss in accuracy. Better search also leads to better learning, and our final parser outperforms all previously reported dependency parsers for English and Chinese, yet is much faster.</p><p>5 0.59501147 <a title="12-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Rebanking_CCGbank_for_Improved_NP_Interpretation.html">203 acl-2010-Rebanking CCGbank for Improved NP Interpretation</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Honnibal ; James R.

Instead, separate resources are created to address such problems. In this paper we show how to improve the quality of a treebank, by integrating resources and implementing improved analyses for specific constructions. We demonstrate this rebanking process by creating an updated version of CCGbank that includes the predicate-argument structure of both verbs and nouns, baseNP brackets, verb-particle constructions, and restrictive and non-restrictive nominal modifiers; and evaluate the impact of these changes on a statistical parser.</p><p>6 0.59483832 <a title="12-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Transition-Based_Parsing_with_Confidence-Weighted_Classification.html">241 acl-2010-Transition-Based Parsing with Confidence-Weighted Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Yotaro Watanabe ; Masayuki Asahara ; Yuji Matsumoto</p><p>Abstract: In predicate-argument structure analysis, it is important to capture non-local dependencies among arguments and interdependencies between the sense of a predicate and the semantic roles of its arguments. However, no existing approach explicitly handles both non-local dependencies and semantic dependencies between predicates and arguments. In this paper we propose a structured model that overcomes the limitation of existing approaches; the model captures both types of dependencies simultaneously by introducing four types of factors including a global factor type capturing non-local dependencies among arguments and a pairwise factor type capturing local dependencies between a predicate and an argument. In experiments the proposed model achieved competitive results compared to the stateof-the-art systems without applying any feature selection procedure.</p><p>3 0.57501328 <a title="12-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Joint_Syntactic_and_Semantic_Parsing_of_Chinese.html">153 acl-2010-Joint Syntactic and Semantic Parsing of Chinese</a></p>
<p>Author: Junhui Li ; Guodong Zhou ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: This paper explores joint syntactic and semantic parsing of Chinese to further improve the performance of both syntactic and semantic parsing, in particular the performance of semantic parsing (in this paper, semantic role labeling). This is done from two levels. Firstly, an integrated parsing approach is proposed to integrate semantic parsing into the syntactic parsing process. Secondly, semantic information generated by semantic parsing is incorporated into the syntactic parsing model to better capture semantic information in syntactic parsing. Evaluation on Chinese TreeBank, Chinese PropBank, and Chinese NomBank shows that our integrated parsing approach outperforms the pipeline parsing approach on n-best parse trees, a natural extension of the widely used pipeline parsing approach on the top-best parse tree. Moreover, it shows that incorporating semantic role-related information into the syntactic parsing model significantly improves the performance of both syntactic parsing and semantic parsing. To our best knowledge, this is the first research on exploring syntactic parsing and semantic role labeling for both verbal and nominal predicates in an integrated way. 1</p><p>4 0.57290548 <a title="12-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Kernel_Based_Discourse_Relation_Recognition_with_Temporal_Ordering_Information.html">155 acl-2010-Kernel Based Discourse Relation Recognition with Temporal Ordering Information</a></p>
<p>Author: WenTing Wang ; Jian Su ; Chew Lim Tan</p><p>Abstract: Syntactic knowledge is important for discourse relation recognition. Yet only heuristically selected flat paths and 2-level production rules have been used to incorporate such information so far. In this paper we propose using tree kernel based approach to automatically mine the syntactic information from the parse trees for discourse analysis, applying kernel function to the tree structures directly. These structural syntactic features, together with other normal flat features are incorporated into our composite kernel to capture diverse knowledge for simultaneous discourse identification and classification for both explicit and implicit relations. The experiment shows tree kernel approach is able to give statistical significant improvements over flat syntactic path feature. We also illustrate that tree kernel approach covers more structure information than the production rules, which allows tree kernel to further incorporate information from a higher dimension space for possible better discrimination. Besides, we further propose to leverage on temporal ordering information to constrain the interpretation of discourse relation, which also demonstrate statistical significant improvements for discourse relation recognition on PDTB 2.0 for both explicit and implicit as well.

We demonstrate this rebanking process by creating an updated version of CCGbank that includes the predicate-argument structure of both verbs and nouns, baseNP brackets, verb-particle constructions, and restrictive and non-restrictive nominal modifiers; and evaluate the impact of these changes on a statistical parser.</p><p>6 0.57036006 <a title="12-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Hard_Constraints_for_Grammatical_Function_Labelling.html">130 acl-2010-Hard Constraints for Grammatical Function Labelling</a></p>

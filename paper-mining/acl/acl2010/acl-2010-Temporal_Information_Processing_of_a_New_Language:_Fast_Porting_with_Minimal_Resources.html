</p><p>3 1 Introduction Temporal information processing is a topic of natural language processing boosted by recent evaluation campaigns like TERN2004,1 TempEval-1 (Verhagen et al. [sent-4, score-0.076]
</p><p>4 , 2007) and the forthcoming  TempEval-22 (Pustejovsky and Verhagen, 2009). [sent-5, score-0.039]
</p><p>5 For instance, in the TempEval-1 competition, three tasks were proposed: a) identifying the temporal relation (such as overlap, before or after) holding between events and temporal entities such as dates, times and temporal durations denoted by expressions (i. [sent-6, score-1.476]
</p><p>6 temporal expressions) occurring in the same sentence; b) identifying the temporal relation holding between events expressed in a document and its creation time; c) identifying the temporal relation between the main events expressed by two adjacent sentences. [sent-8, score-1.528]
</p><p>7 Supervised machine learning approaches are pervasive in the tasks of temporal information processing. [sent-9, score-0.407]
</p><p>8 Even when the best performing systems in these competitions are symbolic, there are machine learning solutions with results close to their performance. [sent-10, score-0.133]
</p><p>9 In the TERN2004 competition (aimed at identifying and  normalizing temporal expressions), a symbolic system performed best, but since then machine learning solutions, such as (Ahn et al. [sent-16, score-0.525]
</p><p>10 These evaluations made available sets of annotated data for English and other languages, used for training and evaluation. [sent-18, score-0.052]
</p><p>11 One natural question to ask is whether it is feasible to adapt the training and test data made available in these competitions to other languages, for which no such data still exist. [sent-19, score-0.112]
</p><p>12 Since the annotations are largely of a semantic nature, not many changes need to be done in the annotations once the textual material is translated. [sent-20, score-0.206]
</p><p>13 In essence, this would be a fast way to create temporal information processing systems for languages for which there are no annotated data yet. [sent-21, score-0.424]
</p><p>14 In this paper, we report on an experiment that consisted in adapting the English data of TempEval-1 to Portuguese. [sent-22, score-0.048]
</p><p>15 Since the results are quite similar, this permits to conclude that  such an approach can rapidly generate relevant and comparable data and is useful when porting temporal information processing solutions to new languages. [sent-24, score-0.627]

</p><p>17 , which allows for research to be conducted with a derived corpus that is compa-  rable to research using the original corpus. [sent-28, score-0.043]
</p><p>18 There is of course the caveat that the adaptation process can introduce errors. [sent-29, score-0.134]
</p><p>19 In Section 2, we provide a quick overview of the TimeML annotations in the TempEval-1 data. [sent-31, score-0.137]
</p><p>20 Section 4 contains a brief quantitative comparison of the two corpora. [sent-33, score-0.047]
</p><p>21 In Section 5, the results of replicating one of the approaches present in the TempEval-1 challenge with the Portuguese data are presented. [sent-34, score-0.037]
</p><p>22 In this corpus, event terms are tagged with   elements. [sent-38, score-0.106]
</p><p>23 The EVENT-st ring attribute is the character data inside the element. [sent-39, score-0.108]
</p><p>24 The other attributes correspond to the feature of   elements, P Istands for present indicative, and PP I past indicative (pret ´erito peris  (presented above in Table 1). [sent-40, score-0.147]
</p><p>25 The motivation to run this algorithm over these data is that decision trees are human readable and make it easy to inspect what decisions the classifier is making. [sent-44, score-0.139]
</p><p>26 The results for the decision trees are in this table, too. [sent-47, score-0.034]
</p><p>27 The results obtained are almost identical to the results for the original dataset in English. [sent-48, score-0.043]
</p><p>28 In general, one sees past tenses associated with the BEFORE class and future tenses associated with the AFTER class (including the conditional forms of verbs). [sent-50, score-0.328]
</p><p>29 Infinitives are mostly associated with the AFTER class, and present subjunctive forms with AFTER and OVERLAP. [sent-51, score-0.104]
</p><p>30 Figure 3 shows the rule set induced by the RIPPER algorithm. [sent-52, score-0.072]
</p><p>31 For instance, in task A, the event  term and the temporal expression that denote the entities that are to be ordered may not even be directly syntactically related. [sent-54, score-0.596]
</p><p>32 Therefore, it is hard to 676 ( eClas s = OCCURRENCE ) and ( eTens e =  INF ) and ( eP olarity  =  POS ) =>  lRe lType= AFTER ( 18 3 . [sent-55, score-0.046]
</p><p>33 INF stands for infinitive, F I future indicative, is IR-P I INF is an infinitive form following a present indicative form of the verb ir (to go), PC is present + subjunctive, C is conditional, P I present indicative. [sent-73, score-0.18]
</p><p>34 In any case, the top of the induced tree for task A is: oAdj acent = True : OVERLAP ( 5 5 4 . [sent-75, score-0.228]
</p><p>35 0 ) 2 Here, oAd j acent is the ORDER-ad j acent attribute. [sent-77, score-0.312]
</p><p>36 Assuming this attribute is an indication that the event term and the temporal expression are related syntactically, it is interesting to see that the typical temporal relation between the two entities in this case is an OVERLAP relation. [sent-78, score-1.0]
</p><p>37 The rest of the tree is much more ad-hoc, making frequent use of the stem attribute of   elements, sug-  gesting the classifier is memorizing the data. [sent-79, score-0.143]
</p><p>38 Task C, where two events are to be ordered, produced more complicated classifiers. [sent-80, score-0.087]
</p><p>39 Generally the induced rules and the tree paths compare the tense and the class ofthe two event terms, showing some expected heuristics (such as, if the tense of the first event is future and the tense of the second event is past, assign AFTER). [sent-81, score-0.674]
</p><p>40 6  Discussion  In this paper, we described the semi-automatic adaptation of a TimeML annotated corpus from English to Portuguese, a language for which TimeML annotated data was not available yet. [sent-83, score-0.201]
</p><p>41 Because most of the TimeML annotations are semantic in nature, they can be transposed to a translation of the original corpus, with few adaptations being required. [sent-84, score-0.283]
</p><p>42 In order to validate this adaptation, we used the obtained data to replicate some results in the literature that used the original English data. [sent-85, score-0.156]
</p><p>43 This indicates that our approach to adapt existing annotated data to a different language is fruitful. [sent-87, score-0.09]

<p>Author: WenTing Wang ; Jian Su ; Chew Lim Tan</p><p>Abstract: Syntactic knowledge is important for discourse relation recognition. Yet only heuristically selected flat paths and 2-level production rules have been used to incorporate such information so far. In this paper we propose using tree kernel based approach to automatically mine the syntactic information from the parse trees for discourse analysis, applying kernel function to the tree structures directly. These structural syntactic features, together with other normal flat features are incorporated into our composite kernel to capture diverse knowledge for simultaneous discourse identification and classification for both explicit and implicit relations. The experiment shows tree kernel approach is able to give statistical significant improvements over flat syntactic path feature. We also illustrate that tree kernel approach covers more structure information than the production rules, which allows tree kernel to further incorporate information from a higher dimension space for possible better discrimination. Besides, we further propose to leverage on temporal ordering information to constrain the interpretation of discourse relation, which also demonstrate statistical significant improvements for discourse relation recognition on PDTB 2.0 for both explicit and implicit as well.

<p>Author: Tingxu Yan ; Tamsin Maxwell ; Dawei Song ; Yuexian Hou ; Peng Zhang</p><p>Abstract: p . zhang1 @ rgu .ac .uk Bag-of-words approaches to information retrieval (IR) are effective but assume independence between words. The Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) is a cognitively motivated and validated semantic space model that captures statistical dependencies between words by considering their co-occurrences in a surrounding window of text. HAL has been successfully applied to query expansion in IR, but has several limitations, including high processing cost and use of distributional statistics that do not exploit syntax. In this paper, we pursue two methods for incorporating syntactic-semantic information from textual ‘events’ into HAL. We build the HAL space directly from events to investigate whether processing costs can be reduced through more careful definition of word co-occurrence, and improve the quality of the pseudo-relevance feedback by applying event information as a constraint during HAL construction. Both methods significantly improve performance results in comparison with original HAL, and interpolation of HAL and relevance model expansion outperforms either method alone.</p><p>5 0.46966454 <a title="225-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-The_Manually_Annotated_Sub-Corpus%3A_A_Community_Resource_for_and_by_the_People.html">230 acl-2010-The Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus: A Community Resource for and by the People</a></p>
<p>Author: Nancy Ide ; Collin Baker ; Christiane Fellbaum ; Rebecca Passonneau</p><p>Abstract: The Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC) project provides data and annotations to serve as the base for a communitywide annotation effort of a subset of the American National Corpus. The MASC infrastructure enables the incorporation of contributed annotations into a single, usable format that can then be analyzed as it is or ported to any of a variety of other formats. MASC includes data from a much wider variety of genres than existing multiply-annotated corpora of English, and the project is committed to a fully open model of distribution, without restriction, for all data and annotations produced or contributed. As such, MASC is the first large-scale, open, communitybased effort to create much needed language resources for NLP. This paper describes the MASC project, its corpus and annotations, and serves as a call for contributions of data and annotations from the language processing community.</p><p>6 0.40571371 <a title="225-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Detecting_Experiences_from_Weblogs.html">85 acl-2010-Detecting Experiences from Weblogs</a></p>

<p>Author: Francisco Costa ; Antonio Branco</p><p>Abstract: We describe the semi-automatic adaptation of a TimeML annotated corpus from English to Portuguese, a language for which TimeML annotated data was not available yet. In order to validate this adaptation, we use the obtained data to replicate some results in the literature that used the original English data. The fact that comparable results are obtained indicates that our approach can be used successfully to rapidly create semantically annotated resources for new languages.</p><p>2 0.59298509 <a title="225-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-The_Impact_of_Interpretation_Problems_on_Tutorial_Dialogue.html">227 acl-2010-The Impact of Interpretation Problems on Tutorial Dialogue</a></p>
<p>Author: Myroslava O. Dzikovska ; Johanna D. Moore ; Natalie Steinhauser ; Gwendolyn Campbell</p><p>Abstract: Supporting natural language input may improve learning in intelligent tutoring systems. However, interpretation errors are unavoidable and require an effective recovery policy. We describe an evaluation of an error recovery policy in the BEETLE II tutorial dialogue system and discuss how different types of interpretation problems affect learning gain and user satisfaction. In particular, the problems arising from student use of non-standard terminology appear to have negative consequences. We argue that existing strategies for dealing with terminology problems are insufficient and that improving such strategies is important in future ITS research.</p><p>3 0.55181974 <a title="225-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Paraphrase_Lattice_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">192 acl-2010-Paraphrase Lattice for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Takashi Onishi ; Masao Utiyama ; Eiichiro Sumita</p><p>Abstract: Lattice decoding in statistical machine translation (SMT) is useful in speech translation and in the translation of German because it can handle input ambiguities such as speech recognition ambiguities and German word segmentation ambiguities. We show that lattice decoding is also useful for handling input variations. Given an input sentence, we build a lattice which represents paraphrases of the input sentence. We call this a paraphrase lattice. Then, we give the paraphrase lattice as an input to the lattice decoder. The decoder selects the best path for decoding. Using these paraphrase lattices as inputs, we obtained significant gains in BLEU scores for IWSLT and Europarl datasets.</p><p>4 0.39189327 <a title="225-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Supervised_Noun_Phrase_Coreference_Research%3A_The_First_Fifteen_Years.html">219 acl-2010-Supervised Noun Phrase Coreference Research: The First Fifteen Years</a></p>

<p>Author: Diarmuid O Seaghdha</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes the application of so-called topic models to selectional preference induction. Three models related to Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a proven method for modelling document-word cooccurrences, are presented and evaluated on datasets of human plausibility judgements. Compared to previously proposed techniques, these models perform very competitively, especially for infrequent predicate-argument combinations where they exceed the quality of Web-scale predictions while using relatively little data.</p><p>6 0.38862205 <a title="225-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Beetle_II%3A_A_System_for_Tutoring_and_Computational_Linguistics_Experimentation.html">47 acl-2010-Beetle II: A System for Tutoring and Computational Linguistics Experimentation</a></p>

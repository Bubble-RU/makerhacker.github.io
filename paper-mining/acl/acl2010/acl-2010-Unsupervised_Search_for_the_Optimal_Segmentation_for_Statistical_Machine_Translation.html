<p>Author: Reyyan Yeniterzi ; Kemal Oflazer</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel scheme to apply factored phrase-based SMT to a language pair with very disparate morphological structures. Our approach relies on syntactic analysis on the source side (English) and then encodes a wide variety of local and non-local syntactic structures as complex structural tags which appear as additional factors in the training data. On the target side (Turkish), we only perform morphological analysis and disambiguation but treat the complete complex morphological tag as a factor, instead of separating morphemes. We incrementally explore capturing various syntactic substructures as complex tags on the English side, and evaluate how our translations improve in BLEU scores. Our maximal set of source and target side transformations, coupled with some additional techniques, provide an 39% relative improvement from a baseline 17.08 to 23.78 BLEU, all averaged over 10 training and test sets. Now that the syntactic analysis on the English side is available, we also experiment with more long distance constituent reordering to bring the English constituent order close to Turkish, but find that these transformations do not provide any additional consistent tangible gains when averaged over the 10 sets.</p><p>3 0.21740764 <a title="249-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Boosting-Based_System_Combination_for_Machine_Translation.html">54 acl-2010-Boosting-Based System Combination for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Xiao ; Jingbo Zhu ; Muhua Zhu ; Huizhen Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a simple and effective method to address the issue of how to generate diversified translation systems from a single Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) engine for system combination. Our method is based on the framework of boosting. First, a sequence of weak translation systems is generated from a baseline system in an iterative manner. Then, a strong translation system is built from the ensemble of these weak translation systems. To adapt boosting to SMT system combination, several key components of the original boosting algorithms are redesigned in this work. We evaluate our method on Chinese-to-English Machine Translation (MT) tasks in three baseline systems, including a phrase-based system, a hierarchical phrasebased system and a syntax-based system. The experimental results on three NIST evaluation test sets show that our method leads to significant improvements in translation accuracy over the baseline systems. 1</p><p>4 0.20085694 <a title="249-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Improving_Arabic-to-English_Statistical_Machine_Translation_by_Reordering_Post-Verbal_Subjects_for_Alignment.html">145 acl-2010-Improving Arabic-to-English Statistical Machine Translation by Reordering Post-Verbal Subjects for Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Marine Carpuat ; Yuval Marton ; Nizar Habash</p><p>Abstract: We study the challenges raised by Arabic verb and subject detection and reordering in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). We show that post-verbal subject (VS) constructions are hard to translate because they have highly ambiguous reordering patterns when translated to English. In addition, implementing reordering is difficult because the boundaries of VS constructions are hard to detect accurately, even with a state-of-the-art Arabic dependency parser. We therefore propose to reorder VS constructions into SV order for SMT word alignment only. This strategy significantly improves BLEU and TER scores, even on a strong large-scale baseline and despite noisy parses.</p><p>5 0.19286418 <a title="249-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Unsupervised_Discourse_Segmentation_of_Documents_with_Inherently_Parallel_Structure.html">246 acl-2010-Unsupervised Discourse Segmentation of Documents with Inherently Parallel Structure</a></p>
<p>Author: Minwoo Jeong ; Ivan Titov</p><p>Abstract: Documents often have inherently parallel structure: they may consist of a text and commentaries, or an abstract and a body, or parts presenting alternative views on the same problem. Revealing relations between the parts by jointly segmenting and predicting links between the segments, would help to visualize such documents and construct friendlier user interfaces. To address this problem, we propose an unsupervised Bayesian model for joint discourse segmentation and alignment. We apply our method to the “English as a second language” podcast dataset where each episode is composed of two parallel parts: a story and an explanatory lecture. The predicted topical links uncover hidden re- lations between the stories and the lectures. In this domain, our method achieves competitive results, rivaling those of a previously proposed supervised technique.</p><p>6 0.1778546 <a title="249-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Training_Phrase_Translation_Models_with_Leaving-One-Out.html">240 acl-2010-Training Phrase Translation Models with Leaving-One-Out</a></p>

<p>Author: Sebastian Spiegler ; Peter A. Flach</p><p>Abstract: This paper demonstrates that the use of ensemble methods and carefully calibrating the decision threshold can significantly improve the performance of machine learning methods for morphological word decomposition. We employ two algorithms which come from a family of generative probabilistic models. The models consider segment boundaries as hidden variables and include probabilities for letter transitions within segments. The advantage of this model family is that it can learn from small datasets and easily gen- eralises to larger datasets. The first algorithm PROMODES, which participated in the Morpho Challenge 2009 (an international competition for unsupervised morphological analysis) employs a lower order model whereas the second algorithm PROMODES-H is a novel development of the first using a higher order model. We present the mathematical description for both algorithms, conduct experiments on the morphologically rich language Zulu and compare characteristics of both algorithms based on the experimental results.</p><p>4 0.66034383 <a title="249-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Fixed_Length_Word_Suffix_for_Factored_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">119 acl-2010-Fixed Length Word Suffix for Factored Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Narges Sharif Razavian ; Stephan Vogel</p><p>Abstract: Factored Statistical Machine Translation extends the Phrase Based SMT model by allowing each word to be a vector of factors. Experiments have shown effectiveness of many factors, including the Part of Speech tags in improving the grammaticality of the output. However, high quality part of speech taggers are not available in open domain for many languages. In this paper we used fixed length word suffix as a new factor in the Factored SMT, and were able to achieve significant improvements in three set of experiments: large NIST Arabic to English system, medium WMT Spanish to English system, and small TRANSTAC English to Iraqi system. 1</p><p>5 0.6488952 <a title="249-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Automatic_Sanskrit_Segmentizer_Using_Finite_State_Transducers.html">40 acl-2010-Automatic Sanskrit Segmentizer Using Finite State Transducers</a></p>
<p>Author: Vipul Mittal</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method for automatic segmentation of a Sanskrit string into different words. The input for our segmentizer is a Sanskrit string either encoded as a Unicode string or as a Roman transliterated string and the output is a set of possible splits with weights associated with each of them. We followed two different approaches to segment a Sanskrit text using sandhi1 rules extracted from a parallel corpus of manually sandhi split text. While the first approach augments the finite state transducer used to analyze Sanskrit morphology and traverse it to segment a word, the second approach generates all possible segmentations and validates each constituent using a morph an- alyzer.</p><p>6 0.60155445 <a title="249-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Boosting-Based_System_Combination_for_Machine_Translation.html">54 acl-2010-Boosting-Based System Combination for Machine Translation</a></p>

We explore a particular sparsity bias in dependency grammars that encourages a small number of unique dependency types. Specifically, we investigate sparsity-inducing penalties on the posterior distributions of parent-child POS tag pairs in the posterior regularization (PR) framework of Graça et al. (2007). In ex- periments with 12 languages, we achieve substantial gains over the standard expectation maximization (EM) baseline, with average improvement in attachment accuracy of 6.3%. Further, our method outperforms models based on a standard Bayesian sparsity-inducing prior by an average of 4.9%. On English in particular, we show that our approach improves on several other state-of-the-art techniques.</p><p>4 0.63051456 <a title="249-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Boosting-Based_System_Combination_for_Machine_Translation.html">54 acl-2010-Boosting-Based System Combination for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Xiao ; Jingbo Zhu ; Muhua Zhu ; Huizhen Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a simple and effective method to address the issue of how to generate diversified translation systems from a single Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) engine for system combination. Our method is based on the framework of boosting. First, a sequence of weak translation systems is generated from a baseline system in an iterative manner. Then, a strong translation system is built from the ensemble of these weak translation systems. To adapt boosting to SMT system combination, several key components of the original boosting algorithms are redesigned in this work. We evaluate our method on Chinese-to-English Machine Translation (MT) tasks in three baseline systems, including a phrase-based system, a hierarchical phrasebased system and a syntax-based system. The experimental results on three NIST evaluation test sets show that our method leads to significant improvements in translation accuracy over the baseline systems. 1</p><p>5 0.62919927 <a title="249-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Fully_Unsupervised_Core-Adjunct_Argument_Classification.html">120 acl-2010-Fully Unsupervised Core-Adjunct Argument Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Omri Abend ; Ari Rappoport</p><p>Abstract: The core-adjunct argument distinction is a basic one in the theory of argument structure. The task of distinguishing between the two has strong relations to various basic NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing, semantic role labeling and subcategorization acquisition. This paper presents a novel unsupervised algorithm for the task that uses no supervised models, utilizing instead state-of-the-art syntactic induction algorithms. This is the first work to tackle this task in a fully unsupervised scenario.</p><p>6 0.62006962 <a title="249-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Open-Domain_Semantic_Role_Labeling_by_Modeling_Word_Spans.html">184 acl-2010-Open-Domain Semantic Role Labeling by Modeling Word Spans</a></p>

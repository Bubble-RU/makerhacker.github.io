</p><p>4 We describe an evaluation of an error recovery policy in the BEETLE II tutorial dialogue system and discuss how different types of interpretation problems affect learning gain and user satisfaction. [sent-12, score-1.203]
</p><p>5 In particular, the problems arising from student use of non-standard terminology appear to have negative consequences. [sent-13, score-0.593]
</p><p>6 We argue that existing strategies for dealing with terminology problems are insufficient and that improving such strategies is important in future ITS research. [sent-14, score-0.342]
</p><p>7 1 Introduction There is a mounting body of evidence that student self-explanation and contentful talk in humanhuman tutorial dialogue are correlated with increased learning gain (Chi et al. [sent-15, score-1.016]
</p><p>8 Thus, computer tutors that understand student explanations have the potential to improve student learning (Graesser et al. [sent-18, score-0.811]
</p><p>9 However, understanding and correctly assessing the student’s contributions is a difficult problem due to the wide range of variation observed in student input, and especially due to students’ sometimes vague and incorrect use of domain terminology. [sent-23, score-0.522]
</p><p>10 Many tutorial dialogue systems limit the range of student input by asking short-answer questions. [sent-24, score-0.774]
</p><p>11 This provides a measure of robustness, and previous evaluations of ASR in spoken tutorial dialogue systems indicate that neither word error rate nor concept error rate in such systems affect learning gain (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2005; Pon-Barry  et al. [sent-25, score-0.793]
</p><p>12 However, limiting the range of possible input limits the contentful talk that the students are expected to produce, and therefore may limit the overall effectiveness of the system. [sent-27, score-0.31]
</p><p>13 Most ofthe existing tutoring systems that accept unrestricted language input use classifiers based on statistical text similarity measures to match student answers to open-ended questions with pre-authored anticipated answers (Graesser et al. [sent-28, score-0.862]
</p><p>14 While such systems are robust to unexpected terminology, they provide only a very coarse-grained assessment of student answers. [sent-32, score-0.407]
</p><p>15 Recent research aims to develop methods that produce detailed analyses of student input, including correct, incorrect and missing parts (Nielsen et al. [sent-33, score-0.478]
</p><p>16 , 2008), because the more detailed assessments can help tailor tutoring to the needs of individual students. [sent-35, score-0.314]
</p><p>17 While the detailed assessments of answers to open-ended questions are intended to improve potential learning, they also increase the probability of misunderstandings, which negatively impact  tutoring and therefore negatively impact student learning (Jordan et al. [sent-36, score-1.193]
</p><p>18 Thus, appropriate error recovery strategies are crucially important for tutorial dialogue applications. [sent-38, score-0.755]
</p><p>19 We describe an evaluation of an implemented tutorial dialogue system which aims to accept unrestricted student input and limit misunderstandings by rejecting low confidence interpretations and employing a range oferror recovery strategies depending on the cause of interpretation failure. [sent-39, score-1.399]
</p><p>20 By comparing two different system policies, we demonstrate that with less restricted language input the rate of non-understanding errors impacts both learning gain and user satisfaction, and that problems arising from incorrect use of terminology have a particularly negative impact. [sent-40, score-0.646]
</p><p>21 At the same time,  students appear to be aware that the system does not fully understand them even if it accepts their input without indicating that it is having interpretation problems, and this is reflected in decreased user satisfaction. [sent-45, score-0.548]
</p><p>22 We argue that this indicates that we need better strategies for dealing with terminology problems, and that accepting non-standard terminology without explicitly addressing the difference in acceptable phrasing may not be sufficient for effective tutoring. [sent-46, score-0.564]
</p><p>23 In Section 2 we describe our tutoring system, and the two tutoring policies implemented for the experiment. [sent-47, score-0.546]
</p><p>24 Finally, in Section 4 we discuss the implications of our results for error recovery policies in tutorial dialogue systems. [sent-49, score-0.767]
</p><p>25 , 2010), a tutorial dialogue system which provides tutoring in basic electricity and electronics. [sent-51, score-0.732]
</p><p>26 BEETLE II uses a deep parser together with a domain-specific diagnoser to process student input, and a deep generator to produce tutorial feedback automatically depending on the current tutorial policy. [sent-53, score-0.781]
</p><p>27 It also implements an error recovery policy to deal with interpretation problems. [sent-54, score-0.534]
</p><p>28 While typing removes the uncertainty and errors involved in speech recognition, expected student answers are considerably more complex and varied than in a typical spoken dialogue system. [sent-56, score-0.823]
</p><p>29 Therefore, a significant number of interpretation errors arise, primarily during the semantic interpretation process. [sent-57, score-0.406]
</p><p>30 Our approach to selecting an error recovery policy is to prefer non-understandings to misunderstandings. [sent-59, score-0.375]
</p><p>31 There is a known trade-offin spoken dialogue systems between allowing misunderstandings, i. [sent-60, score-0.257]
</p><p>32 , cases in which a system accepts and acts on an incorrect interpretation of an utterance, and non-understandings, i. [sent-62, score-0.321]
</p><p>33 Since misunderstandings on the part of a computer tutor are known to negatively impact student learning, and since in human-human tutorial dialogue the majority of student responses using unexpected terminology are classified as incorrect (Jordan et al. [sent-65, score-1.925]
</p><p>34 , 2009), it would be a reasonable approach for a tutorial dialogue system to deal with potential interpretation problems by treating low-confidence interpretations as non-understandings and focusing on an  effective non-understanding recovery policy. [sent-66, score-0.835]
</p><p>35 All student utterances are passed through the standard interpretation pipeline, so that the results can be analyzed later. [sent-69, score-0.564]
</p><p>36 However, the system does not attempt to address the student content. [sent-70, score-0.418]
</p><p>37 Instead, regardless of the answer analysis, the system always uses a neutral acceptance and bottom out strategy, giving the student the correct answer every time, e. [sent-71, score-0.838]
</p><p>38 One way to phrase the correct answer is: the open switch creates a gap in the circuit”. [sent-74, score-0.262]
</p><p>39 Thus, the students are never given any indication of whether they have been understood or not. [sent-75, score-0.234]
</p><p>40 The full policy acts differently depending on the analysis of the student answer. [sent-76, score-0.502]
</p><p>41 For correct answers, it acknowledges the answer as correct and optionally restates it (see (Dzikovska et al. [sent-77, score-0.315]
</p><p>42 For incorrect answers, it restates the correct portion of the answer (if any) and provides a hint to guide the student towards the completely correct answer. [sent-79, score-0.839]
</p><p>43 44  The content of the bottom out is the same as in the baseline, except that the full system indicates clearly that the answer was incorrect or was not understood, e. [sent-83, score-0.399]
</p><p>44 The help messages are based on the TargetedHelp approach successfully used in spoken dialogue (Hockey et al. [sent-87, score-0.349]
</p><p>45 , 2003), together with the error classification we developed for tutorial dialogue (Dzikovska et al. [sent-88, score-0.52]
</p><p>46 The goal of the help messages is to give the student as much information as possible  as to why the system failed to understand them but without giving away the answer. [sent-91, score-0.547]
</p><p>47 In comparing the two policies, we would expect that the students in both conditions would learn something, but that the learning gain and user satisfaction would be affected by the difference in policies. [sent-92, score-0.497]
</p><p>48 We hypothesized that students who receive feedback on their errors in the full condition would learn more compared to those in the baseline condition. [sent-93, score-0.372]
</p><p>49 Each session lasted approximately 4 hours, with 232 student language turns in FULL (SD = 25. [sent-97, score-0.367]
</p><p>50 In informal comments after the session many students said that they were frustrated when the system said that it did not understand them. [sent-117, score-0.322]
</p><p>51 However, some students in BASE also mentioned that they sometimes were not sure if the system’s answer was correcting a problem with their answer, or simply phrasing it in a different way. [sent-118, score-0.489]
</p><p>52 We used mean frequency of non-interpretable  utterances (out of all student utterances in each session) to evaluate the effectiveness of the two different policies. [sent-119, score-0.516]
</p><p>53 2 The frequency of nonunderstandings was negatively correlated with learning gain in FULL: r = −0. [sent-121, score-0.43]
</p><p>54 f5 non-understandings was negatively correlated with user satisfaction: FULL r = −0. [sent-128, score-0.357]
</p><p>55 Thus, even though in BASE th −e0 system did not indicate non-understanding, students were negatively affected. [sent-133, score-0.476]
</p><p>56 That is, they were not satisfied with the policy that did not directly address the interpretation problems. [sent-134, score-0.244]
</p><p>57 We investigated the effect of different types of interpretation errors using two criteria. [sent-136, score-0.247]
</p><p>58 The reduced frequency means that  the recovery strategy for this particular error type is effective in reducing the error frequency. [sent-138, score-0.487]
</p><p>59 Second, we looked for the cases where the frequency of a given error type is negatively correlated with either learning gain or user satisfaction. [sent-139, score-0.61]
</p><p>60 An irrelevant answer error occurs when the student makes a statement that uses domain termi2We do not know the percentage of misunderstandings or concept error rate as yet. [sent-143, score-0.986]
</p><p>61 For example, the expected answer to “In circuit 1, which components are in a closed path? [sent-148, score-0.278]
</p><p>62 ” If that happens, in FULL the system says “Sorry, this isn’t the form of answer that I expected. [sent-151, score-0.279]
</p><p>63 I lookam ing for a component”, pointing out to the student the kind of information it is looking for. [sent-152, score-0.367]
</p><p>64 The BASE system for this error, and for all other errors discussed below, gives away the correct answer without indicating that there was a problem with interpreting the student’s utterance, e. [sent-153, score-0.372]
</p><p>65 ” The no appr terms error happens when the stu-  dent is using terminology inappropriate for the lesson in general. [sent-156, score-0.422]
</p><p>66 If instead the student says “Voltage is electricity”, FULL responds with “I am sorry, Iam having trouble understanding. [sent-160, score-0.44]
</p><p>67 We had hoped that by telling the student that the content of their utterance is outside the domain as understood by the system, and hinting at the correct terms to use, the system would guide students towards a better answer. [sent-164, score-0.765]
</p><p>68 Selectional restr failure errors are typically due to incorrect terminology, when the students phrased answers in a way that contradicted the sys- with p <= 0. [sent-165, score-0.626]
</p><p>69 So if the student says “The path is damaged”, the FULL system would respond with “I am sorry, Iam having trouble understanding. [sent-169, score-0.459]
</p><p>70 ” Program error were caused by faults in the underlying network software, but usually occurred when the student was using extremely long and complicated utterances. [sent-172, score-0.48]
</p><p>71 Out of the four important error types described above, only the strategy for irrelevant answer was effective: the frequency of irrelevant answer errors is significantly higher in BASE (t-test, p < 0. [sent-173, score-0.781]
</p><p>72 05), and it is negatively correlated with learning gain in BASE. [sent-174, score-0.393]
</p><p>73 However, one other finding is particularly interesting: the frequency of no appr terms errors is negatively correlated with user satisfaction in BASE. [sent-176, score-0.648]
</p><p>74 This indicates that simply accepting the student’s answer when they are using incorrect terminology and exposing them to the correct answer is not the best strategy, possibly because the students are noticing the unexplained lack of alignment be-  tween their utterance and the system’s answer. [sent-177, score-1.085]
</p><p>75 4  Discussion and Future Work  As discussed in Section 1, previous studies of short-answer tutorial dialogue systems produced a counter-intuitive result: measures of interpretation accuracy were not correlated with learning gain. [sent-178, score-0.665]
</p><p>76 With less restricted language, misunderstandings 46  negatively affected learning. [sent-179, score-0.336]
</p><p>77 Our study provides further evidence that interpretation quality significantly affects learning gain in tutorial dialogue. [sent-180, score-0.469]
</p><p>78 Moreover, while it has long been known that user satisfaction is negatively correlated with interpretation error rates in spoken dialogue, this is the first attempt to evaluate the impact of different types of interpretation errors on task success and usability of a tutoring system. [sent-181, score-1.297]
</p><p>79 In our system, all of the error types negatively correlated with learning gain stem from the same underlying  problem: the use of incorrect or vague terminology by the student. [sent-183, score-0.846]
</p><p>80 With the exception of the irrelevant answer strategy, the targeted help strategies we implemented were not effective in reducing error frequency or improving learning gain. [sent-184, score-0.533]
</p><p>81 One possibility is that irrelevant answer was easier to remediate compared to other error types. [sent-186, score-0.361]
</p><p>82 Help messages for other error types were more frequent when the expected answer was a complex sentence, and multiple possible ways of phrasing the correct answer were acceptable. [sent-191, score-0.646]
</p><p>83 One way to improve the help messages may be to have the system indicate more clearly when user terminology is a problem. [sent-193, score-0.395]
</p><p>84 Our system apologized each time there was a non-understanding, leading students to believe that they may be answering cor-  rectly but the answer is not being understood. [sent-194, score-0.472]
</p><p>85 Together with an appropriate mechanism to detect paraphrases of correct answers (as opposed to vague answers whose correctness is difficult to determine), this approach could be more beneficial in helping students learn. [sent-197, score-0.546]
</p><p>86 However, our results also indicate that simply accepting the incorrect terminology may not be the best strategy. [sent-203, score-0.364]
</p><p>87 Users appear to be sensitive when the system’s language does not align with their terminology, as reflected in the decreased satisfaction ratings associated with higher  rates of incorrect terminology problems in BASE. [sent-204, score-0.43]
</p><p>88 Moreover, prior analysis of human-human data indicates that tutors use different restate strategies depending on the “quality” of the student answers, even if they are accepting them as correct (Dzikovska et al. [sent-205, score-0.579]
</p><p>89 Together, these point at an important unaddressed issue: existing systems are often built on the assumption that only incorrect and missing parts ofthe student answer should be remediated, and a wide range of terminology should be accepted (Graesser et al. [sent-207, score-0.85]
</p><p>90 While it is obviously important for the system to accept a range of different phrasings, our analysis indicates that this may not be sufficient by itself, and students could potentially benefit from addressing the terminology issues with a specifically devised strategy. [sent-210, score-0.505]
</p><p>91 Finally, it could also be possible that some differences between strategy effectiveness were caused by incorrect error type classification. [sent-211, score-0.307]
</p><p>92 Manual examination of several dialogues suggests that most of the errors are assigned to the appropriate type, though in some cases incorrect syntac-  tic parses resulted in unexpected interpretation errors, causing the system to give a confusing help message. [sent-212, score-0.496]

<p>Author: Srinivasan Janarthanam ; Oliver Lemon</p><p>Abstract: We present a data-driven approach to learn user-adaptive referring expression generation (REG) policies for spoken dialogue systems. Referring expressions can be difficult to understand in technical domains where users may not know the technical ‘jargon’ names of the domain entities. In such cases, dialogue systems must be able to model the user’s (lexical) domain knowledge and use appropriate referring expressions. We present a reinforcement learning (RL) framework in which the sys- tem learns REG policies which can adapt to unknown users online. Furthermore, unlike supervised learning methods which require a large corpus of expert adaptive behaviour to train on, we show that effective adaptive policies can be learned from a small dialogue corpus of non-adaptive human-machine interaction, by using a RL framework and a statistical user simulation. We show that in comparison to adaptive hand-coded baseline policies, the learned policy performs significantly better, with an 18.6% average increase in adaptation accuracy. The best learned policy also takes less dialogue time (average 1.07 min less) than the best hand-coded policy. This is because the learned policies can adapt online to changing evidence about the user’s domain expertise.</p><p>4 0.12236305 <a title="227-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Optimising_Information_Presentation_for_Spoken_Dialogue_Systems.html">187 acl-2010-Optimising Information Presentation for Spoken Dialogue Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Verena Rieser ; Oliver Lemon ; Xingkun Liu</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to Information Presentation (IP) in Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) using a data-driven statistical optimisation framework for content planning and attribute selection. First we collect data in a Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) experiment and use it to build a supervised model of human behaviour. This forms a baseline for measuring the performance of optimised policies, developed from this data using Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. We show that the optimised policies significantly outperform the baselines in a variety of generation scenarios: while the supervised model is able to attain up to 87.6% of the possible reward on this task, the RL policies are significantly better in 5 out of 6 scenarios, gaining up to 91.5% of the total possible reward. The RL policies perform especially well in more complex scenarios. We are also the first to show that adding predictive “lower level” features (e.g. from the NLG realiser) is important for optimising IP strategies according to user preferences. This provides new insights into the nature of the IP problem for SDS.</p><p>5 0.12221096 <a title="227-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Towards_Relational_POMDPs_for_Adaptive_Dialogue_Management.html">239 acl-2010-Towards Relational POMDPs for Adaptive Dialogue Management</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre Lison</p><p>Abstract: Open-ended spoken interactions are typically characterised by both structural complexity and high levels of uncertainty, making dialogue management in such settings a particularly challenging problem. Traditional approaches have focused on providing theoretical accounts for either the uncertainty or the complexity of spoken dialogue, but rarely considered the two issues simultaneously. This paper describes ongoing work on a new approach to dialogue management which attempts to fill this gap. We represent the interaction as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) over a rich state space incorporating both dialogue, user, and environment models. The tractability of the resulting POMDP can be preserved using a mechanism for dynamically constraining the action space based on prior knowledge over locally relevant dialogue structures. These constraints are encoded in a small set of general rules expressed as a Markov Logic network. The first-order expressivity of Markov Logic enables us to leverage the rich relational structure of the problem and efficiently abstract over large regions ofthe state and action spaces.</p><p>6 0.12009714 <a title="227-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Metadata-Aware_Measures_for_Answer_Summarization_in_Community_Question_Answering.html">171 acl-2010-Metadata-Aware Measures for Answer Summarization in Community Question Answering</a></p>

However, interpretation errors are unavoidable and require an effective recovery policy.

<p>Author: Pierre Lison</p><p>Abstract: Open-ended spoken interactions are typically characterised by both structural complexity and high levels of uncertainty, making dialogue management in such settings a particularly challenging problem. Traditional approaches have focused on providing theoretical accounts for either the uncertainty or the complexity of spoken dialogue, but rarely considered the two issues simultaneously. This paper describes ongoing work on a new approach to dialogue management which attempts to fill this gap. We represent the interaction as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) over a rich state space incorporating both dialogue, user, and environment models. The tractability of the resulting POMDP can be preserved using a mechanism for dynamically constraining the action space based on prior knowledge over locally relevant dialogue structures. These constraints are encoded in a small set of general rules expressed as a Markov Logic network. The first-order expressivity of Markov Logic enables us to leverage the rich relational structure of the problem and efficiently abstract over large regions ofthe state and action spaces.</p><p>4 0.34200546 <a title="227-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Now%2C_Where_Was_I%3F_Resumption_Strategies_for_an_In-Vehicle_Dialogue_System.html">179 acl-2010-Now, Where Was I? Resumption Strategies for an In-Vehicle Dialogue System</a></p>
<p>Author: Jessica Villing</p><p>Abstract: In-vehicle dialogue systems often contain more than one application, e.g. a navigation and a telephone application. This means that the user might, for example, interrupt the interaction with the telephone application to ask for directions from the navigation application, and then resume the dialogue with the telephone application. In this paper we present an analysis of interruption and resumption behaviour in human-human in-vehicle dialogues and also propose some implications for resumption strategies in an in-vehicle dialogue system.</p><p>5 0.33328596 <a title="227-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-%22Was_It_Good%3F_It_Was_Provocative.%22_Learning_the_Meaning_of_Scalar_Adjectives.html">2 acl-2010-"Was It Good?

<p>Author: Marie-Catherine de Marneffe ; Christopher D. Manning ; Christopher Potts</p><p>Abstract: Texts and dialogues often express information indirectly. For instance, speakers’ answers to yes/no questions do not always straightforwardly convey a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer. The intended reply is clear in some cases (Was it good? It was great!) but uncertain in others (Was it acceptable? It was unprecedented.). In this paper, we present methods for interpreting the answers to questions like these which involve scalar modifiers. We show how to ground scalar modifier meaning based on data collected from the Web. We learn scales between modifiers and infer the extent to which a given answer conveys ‘yes’ or ‘no’ . To evaluate the methods, we collected examples of question–answer pairs involving scalar modifiers from CNN transcripts and the Dialog Act corpus and use response distributions from Mechanical Turk workers to assess the degree to which each answer conveys ‘yes’ or ‘no’ . Our experimental results closely match the Turkers’ response data, demonstrating that meanings can be learned from Web data and that such meanings can drive pragmatic inference.</p><p>6 0.32465065 <a title="227-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Non-Cooperation_in_Dialogue.html">178 acl-2010-Non-Cooperation in Dialogue</a></p>

In order to validate this adaptation, we use the obtained data to replicate some results in the literature that used the original English data.

<p>Author: Takashi Onishi ; Masao Utiyama ; Eiichiro Sumita</p><p>Abstract: Lattice decoding in statistical machine translation (SMT) is useful in speech translation and in the translation of German because it can handle input ambiguities such as speech recognition ambiguities and German word segmentation ambiguities. We show that lattice decoding is also useful for handling input variations. Given an input sentence, we build a lattice which represents paraphrases of the input sentence. We call this a paraphrase lattice. Then, we give the paraphrase lattice as an input to the lattice decoder. The decoder selects the best path for decoding. Using these paraphrase lattices as inputs, we obtained significant gains in BLEU scores for IWSLT and Europarl datasets.</p><p>6 0.4722591 <a title="227-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Using_Anaphora_Resolution_to_Improve_Opinion_Target_Identification_in_Movie_Reviews.html">251 acl-2010-Using Anaphora Resolution to Improve Opinion Target Identification in Movie Reviews</a></p>

<p>Author: Yansong Feng ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we tackle the problem of automatic caption generation for news images. Our approach leverages the vast resource of pictures available on the web and the fact that many of them are captioned. Inspired by recent work in summarization, we propose extractive and abstractive caption generation models.

<p>Author: Hitoshi Nishikawa ; Takaaki Hasegawa ; Yoshihiro Matsuo ; Genichiro Kikui</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for sentiment summarization that takes account of informativeness and readability, simultaneously. Our algorithm generates a summary by selecting and ordering sentences taken from multiple review texts according to two scores that represent the informativeness and readability of the sentence order. The informativeness score is defined by the number of sentiment expressions and the readability score is learned from the target corpus. We evaluate our method by summarizing reviews on restaurants. Our method outperforms an existing algorithm as indicated by its ROUGE score and human readability experiments.</p><p>4 0.17391172 <a title="124-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Generating_Templates_of_Entity_Summaries_with_an_Entity-Aspect_Model_and_Pattern_Mining.html">125 acl-2010-Generating Templates of Entity Summaries with an Entity-Aspect Model and Pattern Mining</a></p>
<p>Author: Peng Li ; Jing Jiang ; Yinglin Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatic generation of summary templates from given collections of summary articles. This kind of summary templates can be useful in various applications. We first develop an entity-aspect LDA model to simultaneously cluster both sentences and words into aspects. We then apply frequent subtree pattern mining on the dependency parse trees of the clustered and labeled sentences to discover sentence patterns that well represent the aspects. Key features of our method include automatic grouping of semantically related sentence patterns and automatic identification of template slots that need to be filled in. We apply our method on five Wikipedia entity categories and compare our method with two baseline methods. Both quantitative evaluation based on human judgment and qualitative comparison demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our method.</p><p>5 0.15397339 <a title="124-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Automatic_Evaluation_of_Linguistic_Quality_in_Multi-Document_Summarization.html">38 acl-2010-Automatic Evaluation of Linguistic Quality in Multi-Document Summarization</a></p>
<p>Author: Emily Pitler ; Annie Louis ; Ani Nenkova</p><p>Abstract: To date, few attempts have been made to develop and validate methods for automatic evaluation of linguistic quality in text summarization. We present the first systematic assessment of several diverse classes of metrics designed to capture various aspects of well-written text. We train and test linguistic quality models on consecutive years of NIST evaluation data in order to show the generality of results. For grammaticality, the best results come from a set of syntactic features. Focus, coherence and referential clarity are best evaluated by a class of features measuring local coherence on the basis of cosine similarity between sentences, coreference informa- tion, and summarization specific features. Our best results are 90% accuracy for pairwise comparisons of competing systems over a test set of several inputs and 70% for ranking summaries of a specific input.</p><p>6 0.15029237 <a title="124-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-A_New_Approach_to_Improving_Multilingual_Summarization_Using_a_Genetic_Algorithm.html">11 acl-2010-A New Approach to Improving Multilingual Summarization Using a Genetic Algorithm</a></p>

<p>Author: Asli Celikyilmaz ; Dilek Hakkani-Tur</p><p>Abstract: Scoring sentences in documents given abstract summaries created by humans is important in extractive multi-document summarization. In this paper, we formulate extractive summarization as a two step learning problem building a generative model for pattern discovery and a regression model for inference. We calculate scores for sentences in document clusters based on their latent characteristics using a hierarchical topic model. Then, using these scores, we train a regression model based on the lexical and structural characteristics of the sentences, and use the model to score sentences of new documents to form a summary. Our system advances current state-of-the-art improving ROUGE scores by ∼7%.

This is motivated by empirical evidence from TAC 2009 data showing that human summaries contain on average more and shorter sentences than the system summaries. We report encouraging preliminary results comparable to those attained by participating systems at TAC 2009.</p><p>5 0.67337066 <a title="124-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-A_Risk_Minimization_Framework_for_Extractive_Speech_Summarization.html">14 acl-2010-A Risk Minimization Framework for Extractive Speech Summarization</a></p>
<p>Author: Shih-Hsiang Lin ; Berlin Chen</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we formulate extractive summarization as a risk minimization problem and propose a unified probabilistic framework that naturally combines supervised and unsupervised summarization models to inherit their individual merits as well as to overcome their inherent limitations. In addition, the introduction of various loss functions also provides the summarization framework with a flexible but systematic way to render the redundancy and coherence relationships among sentences and between sentences and the whole document, respectively. Experiments on speech summarization show that the methods deduced from our framework are very competitive with existing summarization approaches. 1</p><p>6 0.67140746 <a title="124-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Generating_Templates_of_Entity_Summaries_with_an_Entity-Aspect_Model_and_Pattern_Mining.html">125 acl-2010-Generating Templates of Entity Summaries with an Entity-Aspect Model and Pattern Mining</a></p>

<p>Author: Neil McIntyre ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we develop a story generator that leverages knowledge inherent in corpora without requiring extensive manual involvement. A key feature in our approach is the reliance on a story planner which we acquire automatically by recording events, their participants, and their precedence relationships in a training corpus. Contrary to previous work our system does not follow a generate-and-rank architecture. Instead, we employ evolutionary search techniques to explore the space of possible stories which we argue are well suited to the story generation task. Experiments on generating simple children’s stories show that our system outperforms pre- vious data-driven approaches.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.71162564 <a title="124-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Generating_Image_Descriptions_Using_Dependency_Relational_Patterns.html">124 acl-2010-Generating Image Descriptions Using Dependency Relational Patterns</a></p>

<p>Author: Dmitry Davidov ; Ari Rappoport</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel framework for automated extraction and approximation of numerical object attributes such as height and weight from the Web. Given an object-attribute pair, we discover and analyze attribute information for a set of comparable objects in order to infer the desired value. This allows us to approximate the desired numerical values even when no exact values can be found in the text. Our framework makes use of relation defining patterns and WordNet similarity information. First, we obtain from the Web and WordNet a list of terms similar to the given object. Then we retrieve attribute values for each term in this list, and information that allows us to compare different objects in the list and to infer the attribute value range. Finally, we combine the retrieved data for all terms from the list to select or approximate the requested value. We evaluate our method using automated question answering, WordNet enrichment, and comparison with answers given in Wikipedia and by leading search engines. In all of these, our framework provides a significant improvement.</p><p>4 0.56439477 <a title="124-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Syntactic_and_Semantic_Factors_in_Processing_Difficulty%3A_An_Integrated_Measure.html">220 acl-2010-Syntactic and Semantic Factors in Processing Difficulty: An Integrated Measure</a></p>
<p>Author: Jeff Mitchell ; Mirella Lapata ; Vera Demberg ; Frank Keller</p><p>Abstract: The analysis of reading times can provide insights into the processes that underlie language comprehension, with longer reading times indicating greater cognitive load. There is evidence that the language processor is highly predictive, such that prior context allows upcoming linguistic material to be anticipated. Previous work has investigated the contributions of semantic and syntactic contexts in isolation, essentially treating them as independent factors. In this paper we analyze reading times in terms of a single predictive measure which integrates a model of semantic composition with an incremental parser and a language model.</p><p>5 0.56251776 <a title="124-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Improving_the_Use_of_Pseudo-Words_for_Evaluating_Selectional_Preferences.html">148 acl-2010-Improving the Use of Pseudo-Words for Evaluating Selectional Preferences</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathanael Chambers ; Dan Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: This paper improves the use of pseudowords as an evaluation framework for selectional preferences. While pseudowords originally evaluated word sense disambiguation, they are now commonly used to evaluate selectional preferences. A selectional preference model ranks a set of possible arguments for a verb by their semantic fit to the verb. Pseudo-words serve as a proxy evaluation for these decisions. The evaluation takes an argument of a verb like drive (e.g. car), pairs it with an alternative word (e.g. car/rock), and asks a model to identify the original. This paper studies two main aspects of pseudoword creation that affect performance results. (1) Pseudo-word evaluations often evaluate only a subset of the words. We show that selectional preferences should instead be evaluated on the data in its entirety. (2) Different approaches to selecting partner words can produce overly optimistic evaluations. We offer suggestions to address these factors and present a simple baseline that outperforms the state-ofthe-art by 13% absolute on a newspaper domain.</p><p>6 0.56244594 <a title="124-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Bridging_SMT_and_TM_with_Translation_Recommendation.html">56 acl-2010-Bridging SMT and TM with Translation Recommendation</a></p>

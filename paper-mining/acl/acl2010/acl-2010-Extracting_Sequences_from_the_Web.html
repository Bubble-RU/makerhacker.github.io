<p>Author: Francois Mairesse ; Milica Gasic ; Filip Jurcicek ; Simon Keizer ; Blaise Thomson ; Kai Yu ; Steve Young</p><p>Abstract: Most previous work on trainable language generation has focused on two paradigms: (a) using a statistical model to rank a set of generated utterances, or (b) using statistics to inform the generation decision process. Both approaches rely on the existence of a handcrafted generator, which limits their scalability to new domains. This paper presents BAGEL, a statistical language generator which uses dynamic Bayesian networks to learn from semantically-aligned data produced by 42 untrained annotators. A human evaluation shows that BAGEL can generate natural and informative utterances from unseen inputs in the information presentation domain. Additionally, generation perfor- mance on sparse datasets is improved significantly by using certainty-based active learning, yielding ratings close to the human gold standard with a fraction of the data.</p><p>3 0.071827017 <a title="111-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Expanding_Verb_Coverage_in_Cyc_with_VerbNet.html">108 acl-2010-Expanding Verb Coverage in Cyc with VerbNet</a></p>
<p>Author: Clifton McFate</p><p>Abstract: A robust dictionary of semantic frames is an essential element of natural language understanding systems that use ontologies. However, creating lexical resources that accurately capture semantic representations en masse is a persistent problem. Where the sheer amount of content makes hand creation inefficient, computerized approaches often suffer from over generality and difficulty with sense disambiguation. This paper describes a semi-automatic method to create verb semantic frames in the Cyc ontology by converting the information contained in VerbNet into a Cyc usable format. This method captures the differences in meaning between types of verbs, and uses existing connections between WordNet, VerbNet, and Cyc to specify distinctions between individual verbs when available. This method provides 27,909 frames to OpenCyc which currently has none and can be used to extend ResearchCyc as well. We show that these frames lead to a 20% increase in sample sentences parsed over the Research Cyc verb lexicon. 1</p><p>4 0.068145894 <a title="111-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Distributional_Similarity_vs._PU_Learning_for_Entity_Set_Expansion.html">89 acl-2010-Distributional Similarity vs. PU Learning for Entity Set Expansion</a></p>

<p>Author: Jeffrey Heinz</p><p>Abstract: This paper provides a unified, learningtheoretic analysis of several learnable classes of languages discussed previously in the literature. The analysis shows that for these classes an incremental, globally consistent, locally conservative, set-driven learner always exists. Additionally, the analysis provides a recipe for constructing new learnable classes. Potential applications include learnable models for aspects of natural language and cognition.</p><p>6 0.06220511 <a title="111-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Automatic_Evaluation_of_Linguistic_Quality_in_Multi-Document_Summarization.html">38 acl-2010-Automatic Evaluation of Linguistic Quality in Multi-Document Summarization</a></p>

<p>Author: Keun Chan Park ; Yoonjae Jeong ; Sung Hyon Myaeng</p><p>Abstract: Weblogs are a source of human activity knowledge comprising valuable information such as facts, opinions and personal experiences. In this paper, we propose a method for mining personal experiences from a large set of weblogs. We define experience as knowledge embedded in a collection of activities or events which an individual or group has actually undergone. Based on an observation that experience-revealing sentences have a certain linguistic style, we formulate the problem of detecting experience as a classification task using various features including tense, mood, aspect, modality, experiencer, and verb classes. We also present an activity verb lexicon construction method based on theories of lexical semantics. Our results demonstrate that the activity verb lexicon plays a pivotal role among selected features in the classification perfor- , mance and shows that our proposed method outperforms the baseline significantly.</p><p>3 0.55224323 <a title="111-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-Weakly_Supervised_Learning_of_Presupposition_Relations_between_Verbs.html">258 acl-2010-Weakly Supervised Learning of Presupposition Relations between Verbs</a></p>
<p>Author: Galina Tremper</p><p>Abstract: Presupposition relations between verbs are not very well covered in existing lexical semantic resources. We propose a weakly supervised algorithm for learning presupposition relations between verbs that distinguishes five semantic relations: presupposition, entailment, temporal inclusion, antonymy and other/no relation. We start with a number of seed verb pairs selected manually for each semantic relation and classify unseen verb pairs. Our algorithm achieves an overall accuracy of 36% for type-based classification.</p><p>4 0.53459483 <a title="111-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Distributional_Similarity_vs._PU_Learning_for_Entity_Set_Expansion.html">89 acl-2010-Distributional Similarity vs. PU Learning for Entity Set Expansion</a></p>

<p>Author: David Vickrey ; Oscar Kipersztok ; Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel system that helps nonexperts find sets of similar words. The user begins by specifying one or more seed words. The system then iteratively suggests a series of candidate words, which the user can either accept or reject. Current techniques for this task typically bootstrap a classifier based on a fixed seed set. In contrast, our system involves the user throughout the labeling process, using active learning to intelligently explore the space of similar words. In particular, our system can take advantage of negative examples provided by the user. Our system combines multiple preexisting sources of similarity data (a standard thesaurus, WordNet, contextual similarity), enabling it to capture many types of similarity groups (“synonyms of crash,” “types of car,” etc.). We evaluate on a hand-labeled evaluation set; our system improves over a strong baseline by 36%.</p><p>6 0.51700151 <a title="111-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Understanding_the_Semantic_Structure_of_Noun_Phrase_Queries.html">245 acl-2010-Understanding the Semantic Structure of Noun Phrase Queries</a></p>

<p>Author: Kornel Laskowski</p><p>Abstract: Substantial research effort has been invested in recent decades into the computational study and automatic processing of multi-party conversation. While most aspects of conversational speech have benefited from a wide availability of analytic, computationally tractable techniques, only qualitative assessments are available for characterizing multi-party turn-taking. The current paper attempts to address this deficiency by first proposing a framework for computing turn-taking model perplexity, and then by evaluating several multi-participant modeling approaches. Experiments show that direct multi-participant models do not generalize to held out data, and likely never will, for practical reasons. In contrast, the Extended-Degree-of-Overlap model represents a suitable candidate for future work in this area, and is shown to successfully predict the distribution of speech in time and across participants in previously unseen conversations.</p><p>2 0.76062518 <a title="111-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-A_Rational_Model_of_Eye_Movement_Control_in_Reading.html">13 acl-2010-A Rational Model of Eye Movement Control in Reading</a></p>
<p>Author: Klinton Bicknell ; Roger Levy</p><p>Abstract: A number of results in the study of realtime sentence comprehension have been explained by computational models as resulting from the rational use of probabilistic linguistic information. Many times, these hypotheses have been tested in reading by linking predictions about relative word difficulty to word-aggregated eye tracking measures such as go-past time. In this paper, we extend these results by asking to what extent reading is well-modeled as rational behavior at a finer level of analysis, predicting not aggregate measures, but the duration and location of each fixation. We present a new rational model of eye movement control in reading, the central assumption of which is that eye move- ment decisions are made to obtain noisy visual information as the reader performs Bayesian inference on the identities of the words in the sentence. As a case study, we present two simulations demonstrating that the model gives a rational explanation for between-word regressions.</p><p>3 0.72484857 <a title="111-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Optimizing_Informativeness_and_Readability_for_Sentiment_Summarization.html">188 acl-2010-Optimizing Informativeness and Readability for Sentiment Summarization</a></p>
<p>Author: Hitoshi Nishikawa ; Takaaki Hasegawa ; Yoshihiro Matsuo ; Genichiro Kikui</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for sentiment summarization that takes account of informativeness and readability, simultaneously. Our algorithm generates a summary by selecting and ordering sentences taken from multiple review texts according to two scores that represent the informativeness and readability of the sentence order. The informativeness score is defined by the number of sentiment expressions and the readability score is learned from the target corpus. We evaluate our method by summarizing reviews on restaurants. Our method outperforms an existing algorithm as indicated by its ROUGE score and human readability experiments.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.72011566 <a title="111-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Extracting_Sequences_from_the_Web.html">111 acl-2010-Extracting Sequences from the Web</a></p>

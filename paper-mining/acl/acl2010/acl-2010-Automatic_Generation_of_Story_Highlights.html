<p>Author: Wolfgang Seeker ; Ines Rehbein ; Jonas Kuhn ; Josef Van Genabith</p><p>Abstract: For languages with (semi-) free word order (such as German), labelling grammatical functions on top of phrase-structural constituent analyses is crucial for making them interpretable. Unfortunately, most statistical classifiers consider only local information for function labelling and fail to capture important restrictions on the distribution of core argument functions such as subject, object etc., namely that there is at most one subject (etc.) per clause. We augment a statistical classifier with an integer linear program imposing hard linguistic constraints on the solution space output by the classifier, capturing global distributional restrictions. We show that this improves labelling quality, in particular for argument grammatical functions, in an intrinsic evaluation, and, importantly, grammar coverage for treebankbased (Lexical-Functional) grammar acquisition and parsing, in an extrinsic evaluation.</p><p>3 0.15290047 <a title="39-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Cross-Language_Document_Summarization_Based_on_Machine_Translation_Quality_Prediction.html">77 acl-2010-Cross-Language Document Summarization Based on Machine Translation Quality Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaojun Wan ; Huiying Li ; Jianguo Xiao</p><p>Abstract: Cross-language document summarization is a task of producing a summary in one language for a document set in a different language. Existing methods simply use machine translation for document translation or summary translation. However, current machine translation services are far from satisfactory, which results in that the quality of the cross-language summary is usually very poor, both in readability and content. In this paper, we propose to consider the translation quality of each sentence in the English-to-Chinese cross-language summarization process. First, the translation quality of each English sentence in the document set is predicted with the SVM regression method, and then the quality score of each sentence is incorporated into the summarization process. Finally, the English sentences with high translation quality and high informativeness are selected and translated to form the Chinese summary. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed approach. 1</p><p>4 0.15059599 <a title="39-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Training_Phrase_Translation_Models_with_Leaving-One-Out.html">240 acl-2010-Training Phrase Translation Models with Leaving-One-Out</a></p>
<p>Author: Joern Wuebker ; Arne Mauser ; Hermann Ney</p><p>Abstract: Several attempts have been made to learn phrase translation probabilities for phrasebased statistical machine translation that go beyond pure counting of phrases in word-aligned training data. Most approaches report problems with overfitting. We describe a novel leavingone-out approach to prevent over-fitting that allows us to train phrase models that show improved translation performance on the WMT08 Europarl German-English task. In contrast to most previous work where phrase models were trained separately from other models used in translation, we include all components such as single word lexica and reordering mod- els in training. Using this consistent training of phrase models we are able to achieve improvements of up to 1.4 points in BLEU. As a side effect, the phrase table size is reduced by more than 80%.</p><p>5 0.14684893 <a title="39-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Bayesian_Synchronous_Tree-Substitution_Grammar_Induction_and_Its_Application_to_Sentence_Compression.html">46 acl-2010-Bayesian Synchronous Tree-Substitution Grammar Induction and Its Application to Sentence Compression</a></p>
<p>Author: Elif Yamangil ; Stuart M. Shieber</p><p>Abstract: We describe our experiments with training algorithms for tree-to-tree synchronous tree-substitution grammar (STSG) for monolingual translation tasks such as sentence compression and paraphrasing. These translation tasks are characterized by the relative ability to commit to parallel parse trees and availability of word alignments, yet the unavailability of large-scale data, calling for a Bayesian tree-to-tree formalism. We formalize nonparametric Bayesian STSG with epsilon alignment in full generality, and provide a Gibbs sampling algorithm for posterior inference tailored to the task of extractive sentence compression. We achieve improvements against a number of baselines, including expectation maximization and variational Bayes training, illustrating the merits of nonparametric inference over the space of grammars as opposed to sparse parametric inference with a fixed grammar.</p><p>6 0.14646123 <a title="39-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Automatic_Evaluation_of_Linguistic_Quality_in_Multi-Document_Summarization.html">38 acl-2010-Automatic Evaluation of Linguistic Quality in Multi-Document Summarization</a></p>

<p>Author: Vahed Qazvinian ; Dragomir R. Radev</p><p>Abstract: Identifying background (context) information in scientific articles can help scholars understand major contributions in their research area more easily. In this paper, we propose a general framework based on probabilistic inference to extract such context information from scientific papers. We model the sentences in an article and their lexical similarities as a Markov Random Field tuned to detect the patterns that context data create, and employ a Belief Propagation mechanism to detect likely context sentences. We also address the problem of generating surveys of scientific papers. Our experiments show greater pyramid scores for surveys generated using such context information rather than citation sentences alone.</p><p>3 0.64355451 <a title="39-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-A_New_Approach_to_Improving_Multilingual_Summarization_Using_a_Genetic_Algorithm.html">11 acl-2010-A New Approach to Improving Multilingual Summarization Using a Genetic Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Marina Litvak ; Mark Last ; Menahem Friedman</p><p>Abstract: Automated summarization methods can be defined as “language-independent,” if they are not based on any languagespecific knowledge. Such methods can be used for multilingual summarization defined by Mani (2001) as “processing several languages, with summary in the same language as input.” In this paper, we introduce MUSE, a languageindependent approach for extractive summarization based on the linear optimization of several sentence ranking measures using a genetic algorithm. We tested our methodology on two languages—English and Hebrew—and evaluated its performance with ROUGE-1 Recall vs. state- of-the-art extractive summarization approaches. Our results show that MUSE performs better than the best known multilingual approach (TextRank1) in both languages. Moreover, our experimental results on a bilingual (English and Hebrew) document collection suggest that MUSE does not need to be retrained on each language and the same model can be used across at least two different languages.</p><p>4 0.62621844 <a title="39-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Wrapping_up_a_Summary%3A_From_Representation_to_Generation.html">264 acl-2010-Wrapping up a Summary: From Representation to Generation</a></p>

This is motivated by empirical evidence from TAC 2009 data showing that human summaries contain on average more and shorter sentences than the system summaries. We report encouraging preliminary results comparable to those attained by participating systems at TAC 2009.</p><p>5 0.62572831 <a title="39-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-A_Semi-Supervised_Key_Phrase_Extraction_Approach%3A_Learning_from_Title_Phrases_through_a_Document_Semantic_Network.html">15 acl-2010-A Semi-Supervised Key Phrase Extraction Approach: Learning from Title Phrases through a Document Semantic Network</a></p>
<p>Author: Decong Li ; Sujian Li ; Wenjie Li ; Wei Wang ; Weiguang Qu</p><p>Abstract: It is a fundamental and important task to extract key phrases from documents. Generally, phrases in a document are not independent in delivering the content of the document. In order to capture and make better use of their relationships in key phrase extraction, we suggest exploring the Wikipedia knowledge to model a document as a semantic network, where both n-ary and binary relationships among phrases are formulated. Based on a commonly accepted assumption that the title of a document is always elaborated to reflect the content of a document and consequently key phrases tend to have close semantics to the title, we propose a novel semi-supervised key phrase extraction approach in this paper by computing the phrase importance in the semantic network, through which the influence of title phrases is propagated to the other phrases iteratively. Experimental results demonstrate the remarkable performance of this approach. 1</p><p>6 0.61029369 <a title="39-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Hard_Constraints_for_Grammatical_Function_Labelling.html">130 acl-2010-Hard Constraints for Grammatical Function Labelling</a></p>

<p>Author: Valentin I. Spitkovsky ; Daniel Jurafsky ; Hiyan Alshawi</p><p>Abstract: We show how web mark-up can be used to improve unsupervised dependency parsing. Starting from raw bracketings of four common HTML tags (anchors, bold, italics and underlines), we refine approximate partial phrase boundaries to yield accurate parsing constraints. Conversion procedures fall out of our linguistic analysis of a newly available million-word hyper-text corpus. We demonstrate that derived constraints aid grammar induction by training Klein and Manning’s Dependency Model with Valence (DMV) on this data set: parsing accuracy on Section 23 (all sentences) of the Wall Street Journal corpus jumps to 50.4%, beating previous state-of-the- art by more than 5%. Web-scale experiments show that the DMV, perhaps because it is unlexicalized, does not benefit from orders of magnitude more annotated but noisier data. Our model, trained on a single blog, generalizes to 53.3% accuracy out-of-domain, against the Brown corpus nearly 10% higher than the previous published best. The fact that web mark-up strongly correlates with syntactic structure may have broad applicability in NLP.</p><p>2 0.98803228 <a title="39-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Assessing_the_Role_of_Discourse_References_in_Entailment_Inference.html">33 acl-2010-Assessing the Role of Discourse References in Entailment Inference</a></p>

We relate our findings to research on word frequency distributions and to discourse analytic studies of perspective.</p><p>same-paper 6 0.97107011 <a title="39-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Automatic_Generation_of_Story_Highlights.html">39 acl-2010-Automatic Generation of Story Highlights</a></p>

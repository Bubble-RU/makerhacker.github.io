<p>Author: Binyang Li ; Lanjun Zhou ; Shi Feng ; Kam-Fai Wong</p><p>Abstract: There is a growing research interest in opinion retrieval as on-line users’ opinions are becoming more and more popular in business, social networks, etc. Practically speaking, the goal of opinion retrieval is to retrieve documents, which entail opinions or comments, relevant to a target subject specified by the user’s query. A fundamental challenge in opinion retrieval is information representation. Existing research focuses on document-based approaches and documents are represented by bag-of-word. However, due to loss of contextual information, this representation fails to capture the associative information between an opinion and its corresponding target. It cannot distinguish different degrees of a sentiment word when associated with different targets. This in turn seriously affects opinion retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a sentence-based approach based on a new information representa- , tion, namely topic-sentiment word pair, to capture intra-sentence contextual information between an opinion and its target. Additionally, we consider inter-sentence information to capture the relationships among the opinions on the same topic. Finally, the two types of information are combined in a unified graph-based model, which can effectively rank the documents. Compared with existing approaches, experimental results on the COAE08 dataset showed that our graph-based model achieved significant improvement. 1</p><p>3 0.48435152 <a title="251-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Sentence_and_Expression_Level_Annotation_of_Opinions_in_User-Generated_Discourse.html">208 acl-2010-Sentence and Expression Level Annotation of Opinions in User-Generated Discourse</a></p>
<p>Author: Cigdem Toprak ; Niklas Jakob ; Iryna Gurevych</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a corpus of consumer reviews from the rateitall and the eopinions websites annotated with opinion-related information. We present a two-level annotation scheme. In the first stage, the reviews are analyzed at the sentence level for (i) relevancy to a given topic, and (ii) expressing an evaluation about the topic. In the second stage, on-topic sentences containing evaluations about the topic are further investigated at the expression level for pinpointing the properties (semantic orientation, intensity), and the functional components of the evaluations (opinion terms, targets and holders). We discuss the annotation scheme, the inter-annotator agreement for different subtasks and our observations.</p><p>4 0.32717544 <a title="251-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Generating_Focused_Topic-Specific_Sentiment_Lexicons.html">123 acl-2010-Generating Focused Topic-Specific Sentiment Lexicons</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhiyang Wang ; Yajuan Lv ; Qun Liu ; Young-Sook Hwang</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel filtration criterion to restrict the rule extraction for the hierarchical phrase-based translation model, where a bilingual but relaxed wellformed dependency restriction is used to filter out bad rules. Furthermore, a new feature which describes the regularity that the source/target dependency edge triggers the target/source word is also proposed. Experimental results show that, the new criteria weeds out about 40% rules while with translation performance improvement, and the new feature brings an- other improvement to the baseline system, especially on larger corpus.</p><p>2 0.90209103 <a title="251-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Simple%2C_Accurate_Parsing_with_an_All-Fragments_Grammar.html">211 acl-2010-Simple, Accurate Parsing with an All-Fragments Grammar</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohit Bansal ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple but accurate parser which exploits both large tree fragments and symbol refinement. We parse with all fragments of the training set, in contrast to much recent work on tree selection in data-oriented parsing and treesubstitution grammar learning. We require only simple, deterministic grammar symbol refinement, in contrast to recent work on latent symbol refinement. Moreover, our parser requires no explicit lexicon machinery, instead parsing input sentences as character streams. Despite its simplicity, our parser achieves accuracies of over 88% F1 on the standard English WSJ task, which is competitive with substantially more complicated state-of-theart lexicalized and latent-variable parsers. Additional specific contributions center on making implicit all-fragments parsing efficient, including a coarse-to-fine inference scheme and a new graph encoding.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.83412671 <a title="251-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Using_Anaphora_Resolution_to_Improve_Opinion_Target_Identification_in_Movie_Reviews.html">251 acl-2010-Using Anaphora Resolution to Improve Opinion Target Identification in Movie Reviews</a></p>

<p>Author: Alan Ritter ; Mausam Mausam ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: The computation of selectional preferences, the admissible argument values for a relation, is a well-known NLP task with broad applicability. We present LDA-SP, which utilizes LinkLDA (Erosheva et al., 2004) to model selectional preferences. By simultaneously inferring latent topics and topic distributions over relations, LDA-SP combines the benefits of previous approaches: like traditional classbased approaches, it produces humaninterpretable classes describing each relation’s preferences, but it is competitive with non-class-based methods in predictive power. We compare LDA-SP to several state-ofthe-art methods achieving an 85% increase in recall at 0.9 precision over mutual information (Erk, 2007). We also evaluate LDA-SP’s effectiveness at filtering improper applications of inference rules, where we show substantial improvement over Pantel et al. ’s system (Pantel et al., 2007).</p><p>5 0.76927572 <a title="251-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-A_Joint_Rule_Selection_Model_for_Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation.html">9 acl-2010-A Joint Rule Selection Model for Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Cui ; Dongdong Zhang ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou ; Tiejun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: In hierarchical phrase-based SMT systems, statistical models are integrated to guide the hierarchical rule selection for better translation performance. Previous work mainly focused on the selection of either the source side of a hierarchical rule or the target side of a hierarchical rule rather than considering both of them simultaneously. This paper presents a joint model to predict the selection of hierarchical rules. The proposed model is estimated based on four sub-models where the rich context knowledge from both source and target sides is leveraged. Our method can be easily incorporated into the practical SMT systems with the log-linear model framework. The experimental results show that our method can yield significant improvements in performance.</p><p>6 0.72900665 <a title="251-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Discriminative_Pruning_for_Discriminative_ITG_Alignment.html">88 acl-2010-Discriminative Pruning for Discriminative ITG Alignment</a></p>

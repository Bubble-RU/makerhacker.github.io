</p><p>2 This paper describes a semi-automatic method to create verb semantic frames in the Cyc ontology by converting the information contained in VerbNet into a Cyc usable format. [sent-8, score-0.651]
</p><p>3 This method captures the differences in meaning between types of verbs, and uses existing connections between WordNet, VerbNet, and Cyc to specify distinctions between individual verbs when available. [sent-9, score-0.136]
</p><p>4 This method provides 27,909 frames to OpenCyc which currently has none and can be used to extend  ResearchCyc as well. [sent-10, score-0.481]
</p><p>5 We show that these frames lead to a 20% increase in sample sentences parsed over the Research Cyc verb lexicon. [sent-11, score-0.555]
</p><p>6 Higher order predicates built into Cyc’s formal language, CycL, allow efficient inferencing about context and meta-language reasoning above and beyond first-order logic rules (Ramachandran et al, 2005). [sent-14, score-0.173]
</p><p>7 Such applications use NL-to-Cycl parsers which use Cyc semantic frames to convert natural language into Cyc representations. [sent-18, score-0.523]
</p><p>8 These frames represent sentence content through a set of propositional logic assertions that first reify the sentence in terms of a real world event and then define the semantic relationships between the elements of the sentence, as described later. [sent-19, score-0.613]
</p><p>9 Because these parsers require semantic frames to represent sentence content, existing parsers are limited due to Cyc’s limited coverage (Curtis et al, 2009). [sent-20, score-0.586]
</p><p>10 The goal is to increase this coverage by automatically translating the class frames in VerbNet into individual verb templates. [sent-21, score-0.662]
</p><p>11 However, the semantic frames remain mostly hand-made in ResearchCyc2 and nonexistent in the open-license OpenCyc3. [sent-23, score-0.523]
</p><p>12 Translating VerbNet frames into Cyc will expand  the natural language capabilities of both. [sent-24, score-0.506]
</p><p>13 There has been previous research on mapping existing Cyc templates to VerbNet, but thus far these approaches have not created new templates to address Cyc’s lapses in coverage. [sent-25, score-0.193]
</p><p>14 Correspondences between a few VerbNet frames and ResearchCyc templates have also been mapped out through the VxC VerbNet Cyc  2 http://research. [sent-29, score-0.577]
</p><p>15 A notable exception to the hand-made paradigm is Curtis et al’s (2009) TextLearner which uses rules and existing semantic frames to handle novel sentence structures. [sent-36, score-0.564]
</p><p>16 Given an existing template that fits some of the syntactic constraints of the sentence, TextLearner will attempt to create a new frame by suggesting a predicate that fits the missing part. [sent-37, score-0.326]
</p><p>17 Often these are general underspecified predicates, but TextLearner is able to use common sense reasoning and existing facts to find better matches (Curtis et al, 2009). [sent-38, score-0.128]
</p><p>18 While TextLearner improves its performance with time, it is not an attempt to create new frames on a large scale. [sent-39, score-0.481]
</p><p>19 Creating generalized frames based on verb classes will increase the depth of the Cyc Lexicon quickly. [sent-40, score-0.577]
</p><p>20 Furthermore, automatic processes like those in TextLearner could be used to make individual verb semantic frames more specific. [sent-41, score-0.619]
</p><p>21 3  VerbNet  VerbNet is an extension of Levin’s (1993) verb classes that uses the class structure to apply  general syntactic frames to member verbs that have those syntactic uses and similar semantic meanings (Kipper et al, 2000). [sent-42, score-0.851]
</p><p>22 The syntactic roles in the frame are appended with general thematic roles that fill arguments of semantic predicates. [sent-46, score-0.283]
</p><p>23 Each event is broken down into a tripartite structure as described by Moens & Steedman (1988) and uses a time modifier for each predicate to indicate when specific predicates occur in the event. [sent-47, score-0.24]
</p><p>24 This approach is transferable to Cyc’s semantic templates in which syntactic slots fill predicate arguments in the context of a specific syntactic frame. [sent-50, score-0.309]
</p><p>25 4 Method The general method for creating semantic templates in Cyc requires creating Verb Class Frames and then using Cyc predicates and heuristic rules to create individual frames for each member verb. [sent-53, score-0.855]
</p><p>26 1 OpenCyc The existing semantic templates are accessible through the ResearchCyc KB. [sent-55, score-0.159]
</p><p>27 OpenCyc was used so as to minimize the effect of existing semantic frames on new frame creation. [sent-59, score-0.696]
</p><p>28 2 Knowledge Representation The primary difficulty with integrating VerbNet frames into Cyc was overcoming differences in knowledge representation. [sent-62, score-0.481]
</p><p>29 Cyc semantic templates reify events as an instance of a collection of events. [sent-63, score-0.198]
</p><p>30 The following is a frame for the VerbNet class Give as presented in the Unified Verb  Index4. [sent-67, score-0.195]
</p><p>31 In Cyc the has Pos ses s ion relationship  to  and Recipient is represented with the predicates giver and givee. [sent-75, score-0.238]
</p><p>32 Thus an individual VerbNet semantic predicate often has a many-toone mapping with Cyc predicates. [sent-78, score-0.146]
</p><p>33 3  Predicates  To account for representation differences, a single Cyc predicate was mapped to a unique combination of Verbnet predicate and thematic role (ie. [sent-80, score-0.22]
</p><p>34 Though far from exhaustive, these hand mappings represent many frequently used predicates in VerbNet. [sent-83, score-0.16]
</p><p>35 Because the mappings were not exhaustive, a safety net automatically catches predicates that haven’t been mapped. [sent-85, score-0.184]
</p><p>36 The VerbNet predicates  Cause and InReactionTo corresponded to the Cyc predicates performedBy doneBy, and cause s -Underspeci fied. [sent-86, score-0.262]
</p><p>37 These predicates were selected whenever the VerbNet predicates occurred with a theme role that was the subject of the sentence. [sent-87, score-0.346]
</p><p>38 The cause s -Underspeci fied predicate was used in frames whose time modifiers suggested that they were continuous states. [sent-90, score-0.563]
</p><p>39 The predicates patientGeneric and pat ientGeneri c- Di rect were used when a predicate was not found for a required object or oblique object. [sent-91, score-0.289]
</p><p>40 Some Cyc templates don’t have predicates that reference the event. [sent-92, score-0.207]
</p><p>41 Most verb frames have an associated collection of events of which each use is an instance. [sent-98, score-0.605]
</p><p>42 The associated collection of the class frame templates was automatically selected using the common link that both resources share with WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998). [sent-99, score-0.321]
</p><p>43 To do this, the WordNet synsets of the member verbs for a class were matched with their Cyc-WordNet s ynonymousExte rnalConcept assertion. [sent-100, score-0.178]
</p><p>44 The most general collection out of the list of viable collections was chosen as the general class frame collection. [sent-102, score-0.332]
</p><p>45 While the most general collection was used for the class semantic frame, at the level of individual verb frames the specific synset denoted collection was substituted for the more general one when applicable. [sent-105, score-0.851]
</p><p>46 The general class level collection was  used in cases where no Cyc-WordNet-VerbNet link existed. [sent-108, score-0.134]
</p><p>47 If no verb had a synset in Cyc, the general collection Situation was used. [sent-109, score-0.145]
</p><p>48 5 Subcategorization Frames Each syntactic frame is a subcategorization frame or a subset of one. [sent-111, score-0.294]
</p><p>49 Specific verb semantic templates were created by inferring that each member verb of a VerbNet class participated Again,  collections  in every template were  taken  in a class. [sent-118, score-0.455]
</p><p>50 FIRE could then be queried for implied verb templates which became the final list of verb templates. [sent-122, score-0.252]
</p><p>51 Subclasses contain verbs that take all of the syntactic formats of the main class plus additional frames that verbs in the main class cannot. [sent-125, score-0.733]
</p><p>52 Verbs in a subclass inherit frames from their superordinate classes. [sent-126, score-0.515]
</p><p>53 If no subclass member had a Cyc denotation, then the main class collection was  used. [sent-129, score-0.187]
</p><p>54 5 Results The end result of this process was the creation of 27,909 verb semantic template assertions for 5,050 different verbs. [sent-130, score-0.217]
</p><p>55 This substantially increases the number of frames for ResearchCyc and creates frames for OpenCyc. [sent-131, score-0.962]
</p><p>56 The first was to compare our frames with the 139 hand-checked VxC matches by hand. [sent-133, score-0.505]
</p><p>57 Of the 139 frames from VxC, 81 were qualified as “good” matches, and 58 as “maybe” (Trumbo, 2006). [sent-134, score-0.481]
</p><p>58 Since these frames already existed in Cyc and were hand matched we used them as the current gold standard for what a VerbNet frame translated into Cyc should look like. [sent-135, score-0.64]
</p><p>59 First was whether the frame had as good a syntactic parse as the manual version. [sent-137, score-0.162]
</p><p>60 This was defined as having predicates that addressed all syntactic roles in the sentence or, if not enough, as many as the VxC match. [sent-138, score-0.161]
</p><p>61 Because framespecific predicates were not created on a large scale, a frame was not rejected for using general predicates. [sent-141, score-0.318]
</p><p>62 First, the VxC mappings included frames in Cyc that only partially matched more syntactically robust VerbNet frames. [sent-143, score-0.566]
</p><p>63 Our frames were only included if they matched the intended VerbNet syntactic frame. [sent-144, score-0.538]
</p><p>64 Because of this some of our frames beat the VxC gold standard for syntactic completeness. [sent-145, score-0.511]
</p><p>65 The VxC frames also included multiple similar senses for an individual verb. [sent-146, score-0.503]
</p><p>66 Our verbs had one denotation per class or subclass. [sent-147, score-0.147]
</p><p>67 Thus in some cases our frames failed not from over generalizing but because they were only meant to represent one meaning per class. [sent-148, score-0.505]
</p><p>68 Since the strength of our approach lies in generating a near exhaustive list of syntactic frames and not multiple word senses, these kinds of failures are not necessarily representative of the success of the frames as a whole. [sent-149, score-1.038]
</p><p>69 9%) of the correct frames having a more complete syntactic parse than the manually mapped frame. [sent-152, score-0.551]
</p><p>70 8%) of the collection 64  rejected frames had a more complete parse than their manual counterparts. [sent-155, score-0.565]
</p><p>71 1%) were as syntactically correct or better than the existing Cyc frame mapped to that VerbNet frame. [sent-157, score-0.242]
</p><p>72 The second test compared the results of a natural language understanding system using either ResearchCyc alone or a version of  ResearchCyc with our frames substituted for theirs. [sent-167, score-0.481]
</p><p>73 The test corpus was 50 randomly selected example sentences from the VerbNet frame examples. [sent-168, score-0.132]
</p><p>74 A parse was judged correct if it returned a verb frame for the central verb of the example sentence that either wholly or in combination with preposition frames addressed the syntactic constituents of the sentence with an acceptable collection and acceptable predicates. [sent-171, score-0.883]
</p><p>75 ResearchCyc got sixteen out of 50 frames correct (32%). [sent-173, score-0.501]
</p><p>76 Eleven frames (22%) did not return a template but did return a denotation to a Cyc collection. [sent-174, score-0.558]
</p><p>77 Twelve verbs (24%) retuned nothing, while eleven (22%) returned frames that were either not the correct syntactic frame or were a different sense of the verb. [sent-175, score-0.759]
</p><p>78 EA NLU running the VerbNet generated frames got 26 out of 50 (52%) frames correct. [sent-176, score-0.962]
</p><p>79 Four generated frames (8%) were either not the correct syntactic frame or were for a different sense of the verb. [sent-179, score-0.663]
</p><p>80 Five (10%) parses using the VerbNet generated correct frames that were labeled as noisy. [sent-181, score-0.501]
</p><p>81 Noisy frames had duplicate predicates or more general predicates in addition to the specific ones. [sent-182, score-0.791]
</p><p>82 The Hold frames separated out in the VxC test are an example of noisy frames. [sent-183, score-0.481]
</p><p>83 None of these frames were syntactically incorrect or contradictory. [sent-184, score-0.51]
</p><p>84 The redundant predicates arise because the predicate safety net had to be greedy. [sent-185, score-0.237]
</p><p>85 This was in the interest of capturing more complex frames that may have multiple relations for the same thematic role in a sentence. [sent-186, score-0.517]
</p><p>86 This evaluation is based on parser recall and frame semantic accuracy only. [sent-187, score-0.174]
</p><p>87 As would be expected, adding more frames to the knowledge base did result in more parser retrievals and possible interpretations. [sent-188, score-0.502]
</p><p>88 To improve predicate specificity, the next phase of research with these  frames will be to implement predicate strengthening methods that move down the hierarchy to find more specific predicates to replace the generalized ones. [sent-190, score-0.829]
</p><p>89 Thus in the future precision both in terms of frame retrieval and predicate specificity will be a vital metric for evaluating success. [sent-191, score-0.214]
</p><p>90 6  Discussion  As has been demonstrated in this approach and in previous research like Curtis et al’s (2009) TextLearner, Cyc provides powerful reasoning capabilities that can be used to successfully infer more specific information from general existing facts. [sent-192, score-0.156]
</p><p>91 While many of the frames are general, they provide a solid foundation for further research. [sent-195, score-0.481]
</p><p>92 As they are now, the added 27,909 frames increase the language capabilities of OpenCyc  which previously had none. [sent-196, score-0.506]
</p><p>93 However, with 35% of frames in the VxC comparison and 16% in the parse test failing because of collections, and 10. [sent-200, score-0.481]
</p><p>94 8% of the VxC comparison set and 10% of correct parses classified as noisy, these frames are not as precise as the existing frames. [sent-201, score-0.542]
</p><p>95 The goal of these frames is not necessarily to replace the existing frames, but rather to extend coverage and provide a platform for further development whether by hand or through automatic methods. [sent-202, score-0.544]
</p><p>96 Additionally, there is a tradeoff between the number of frames covered and efficiency of disambiguation. [sent-206, score-0.481]
</p><p>97 More frame choices make it harder for parsers to choose the correct frame, but it will hopefully improve their handling of more complex sentence structures. [sent-207, score-0.152]
</p><p>98 The class based approach makes it easy to separate verbs by types, such as verbs that relate to mechanical processes or emotion verbs. [sent-209, score-0.159]
</p><p>99 One could use classes of frames to strengthen specific areas of parsing while choosing not to take verbs from a class covering a domain that the parser already performs strongly in. [sent-210, score-0.641]
</p><p>100 Thus an approach to computational verb semantic representation that is rooted in classes can take advantage of modern reasoning sources like Cyc to efficiently create semantic knowledge. [sent-213, score-0.222]

In this paper, we propose a method for mining personal experiences from a large set of weblogs. We define experience as knowledge embedded in a collection of activities or events which an individual or group has actually undergone. Based on an observation that experience-revealing sentences have a certain linguistic style, we formulate the problem of detecting experience as a classification task using various features including tense, mood, aspect, modality, experiencer, and verb classes. We also present an activity verb lexicon construction method based on theories of lexical semantics. Our results demonstrate that the activity verb lexicon plays a pivotal role among selected features in the classification perfor- , mance and shows that our proposed method outperforms the baseline significantly.</p><p>4 0.10325532 <a title="108-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Fully_Unsupervised_Core-Adjunct_Argument_Classification.html">120 acl-2010-Fully Unsupervised Core-Adjunct Argument Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Clifton McFate</p><p>Abstract: A robust dictionary of semantic frames is an essential element of natural language understanding systems that use ontologies. However, creating lexical resources that accurately capture semantic representations en masse is a persistent problem. Where the sheer amount of content makes hand creation inefficient, computerized approaches often suffer from over generality and difficulty with sense disambiguation. This paper describes a semi-automatic method to create verb semantic frames in the Cyc ontology by converting the information contained in VerbNet into a Cyc usable format. This method captures the differences in meaning between types of verbs, and uses existing connections between WordNet, VerbNet, and Cyc to specify distinctions between individual verbs when available. This method provides 27,909 frames to OpenCyc which currently has none and can be used to extend ResearchCyc as well. We show that these frames lead to a 20% increase in sample sentences parsed over the Research Cyc verb lexicon. 1</p><p>2 0.73590761 <a title="108-lsi-2" href="./acl-2010-Detecting_Experiences_from_Weblogs.html">85 acl-2010-Detecting Experiences from Weblogs</a></p>
<p>Author: Keun Chan Park ; Yoonjae Jeong ; Sung Hyon Myaeng</p><p>Abstract: Weblogs are a source of human activity knowledge comprising valuable information such as facts, opinions and personal experiences. In this paper, we propose a method for mining personal experiences from a large set of weblogs. We define experience as knowledge embedded in a collection of activities or events which an individual or group has actually undergone. Based on an observation that experience-revealing sentences have a certain linguistic style, we formulate the problem of detecting experience as a classification task using various features including tense, mood, aspect, modality, experiencer, and verb classes. We also present an activity verb lexicon construction method based on theories of lexical semantics. Our results demonstrate that the activity verb lexicon plays a pivotal role among selected features in the classification perfor- , mance and shows that our proposed method outperforms the baseline significantly.</p><p>3 0.69095135 <a title="108-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-Automatic_Selectional_Preference_Acquisition_for_Latin_Verbs.html">41 acl-2010-Automatic Selectional Preference Acquisition for Latin Verbs</a></p>
<p>Author: Barbara McGillivray</p><p>Abstract: We present a system that automatically induces Selectional Preferences (SPs) for Latin verbs from two treebanks by using Latin WordNet. Our method overcomes some of the problems connected with data sparseness and the small size of the input corpora. We also suggest a way to evaluate the acquired SPs on unseen events extracted from other Latin corpora.</p><p>4 0.61824822 <a title="108-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-GernEdiT_-_The_GermaNet_Editing_Tool.html">126 acl-2010-GernEdiT - The GermaNet Editing Tool</a></p>
<p>Author: Verena Henrich ; Erhard Hinrichs</p><p>Abstract: GernEdiT (short for: GermaNet Editing Tool) offers a graphical interface for the lexicographers and developers of GermaNet to access and modify the underlying GermaNet resource. GermaNet is a lexical-semantic wordnet that is modeled after the Princeton WordNet for English. The traditional lexicographic development of GermaNet was error prone and time-consuming, mainly due to a complex underlying data format and no opportunity of automatic consistency checks. GernEdiT replaces the earlier development by a more userfriendly tool, which facilitates automatic checking of internal consistency and correctness of the linguistic resource. This paper pre- sents all these core functionalities of GernEdiT along with details about its usage and usability. 1</p><p>5 0.54254383 <a title="108-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Weakly_Supervised_Learning_of_Presupposition_Relations_between_Verbs.html">258 acl-2010-Weakly Supervised Learning of Presupposition Relations between Verbs</a></p>
<p>Author: Galina Tremper</p><p>Abstract: Presupposition relations between verbs are not very well covered in existing lexical semantic resources. We propose a weakly supervised algorithm for learning presupposition relations between verbs that distinguishes five semantic relations: presupposition, entailment, temporal inclusion, antonymy and other/no relation. We start with a number of seed verb pairs selected manually for each semantic relation and classify unseen verb pairs. Our algorithm achieves an overall accuracy of 36% for type-based classification.</p><p>6 0.48673004 <a title="108-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Generating_Entailment_Rules_from_FrameNet.html">121 acl-2010-Generating Entailment Rules from FrameNet</a></p>

<p>Author: Benjamin Van Durme ; Ashwin Lall</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by the recent interest in streaming algorithms for processing large text collections, we revisit the work of Ravichandran et al. (2005) on using the Locality Sensitive Hash (LSH) method of Charikar (2002) to enable fast, approximate comparisons of vector cosine similarity. For the common case of feature updates being additive over a data stream, we show that LSH signatures can be maintained online, without additional approximation error, and with lower memory requirements than when using the standard offline technique.</p><p>3 0.59358561 <a title="108-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Using_Parse_Features_for_Preposition_Selection_and_Error_Detection.html">252 acl-2010-Using Parse Features for Preposition Selection and Error Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Diarmuid O Seaghdha</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes the application of so-called topic models to selectional preference induction. Three models related to Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a proven method for modelling document-word cooccurrences, are presented and evaluated on datasets of human plausibility judgements. Compared to previously proposed techniques, these models perform very competitively, especially for infrequent predicate-argument combinations where they exceed the quality of Web-scale predictions while using relatively little data.</p><p>5 0.39244053 <a title="108-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Contextualizing_Semantic_Representations_Using_Syntactically_Enriched_Vector_Models.html">70 acl-2010-Contextualizing Semantic Representations Using Syntactically Enriched Vector Models</a></p>

It employs a systematic combination of first- and second-order context vectors. We apply our model to two different tasks and show that (i) it substantially outperforms previous work on a paraphrase ranking task, and (ii) achieves promising results on a wordsense similarity task; to our knowledge, it is the first time that an unsupervised method has been applied to this task.</p><p>6 0.39153221 <a title="108-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Fully_Unsupervised_Core-Adjunct_Argument_Classification.html">120 acl-2010-Fully Unsupervised Core-Adjunct Argument Classification</a></p>

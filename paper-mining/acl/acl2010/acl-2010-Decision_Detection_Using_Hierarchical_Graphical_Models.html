</p><p>6 1 Introduction In work environments, people share information and make decisions in multi-party conversations known as meetings. [sent-9, score-0.034]
</p><p>7 The demand for systems that can automatically process information contained in audio and video recordings of meetings is growing rapidly. [sent-10, score-0.141]
</p><p>8 We are currently investigating the automatic detection of decision discussions. [sent-13, score-0.299]
</p><p>9 Our approach involves distinguishing between different dialogue act (DA) types based on their role in the decisionmaking process. [sent-14, score-0.205]

</p><p>16 , 2005) have confirmed that meeting participants consider deci-  sions to be one of the most important meeting outputs, and Whittaker et al. [sent-29, score-0.092]
</p><p>17 (2006) found that the development of an automatic decision detection component is critical for re-using meeting archives. [sent-30, score-0.345]
</p><p>18 With the new availability of substantial meeting corpora such as the AMI corpus (McCowan et al. [sent-31, score-0.046]
</p><p>19 , 2005), recent years have seen an increasing amount ofresearch on decisionmaking dialogue. [sent-32, score-0.044]
</p><p>20 This research has tackled issues such as the automatic detection of agreement and disagreement (Galley et al. [sent-33, score-0.111]
</p><p>21 , 2004), and of the level of involvement of conversational participants (Gatica-Perez et al. [sent-34, score-0.047]
</p><p>22 Recent work on automatic detection of decisions has been conducted by Hsueh and Moore (2007), Fern a´ndez et al. [sent-36, score-0.115]
</p><p>23 ” Here, one sub-classifier per DDA class hypothesizes occurrences of that type of DDA and then, based on these hypotheses, a super-classifier determines which regions of dialogue are decision discussions. [sent-45, score-0.555]
</p><p>24 Results were better than those obtained with (Hsueh and Moore, 2007)’s approach—the F1-score for detecting decision discussions in manual transcripts was 0. [sent-47, score-0.38]
</p><p>25 DGMs are attractive because  they provide a natural framework for modeling sequence and dependencies between variables, including the DDAs. [sent-57, score-0.058]
</p><p>26 (2008) obtained much more value from lexical than nonlexical features (and indeed no value at all from prosodic features), but lexical features have limitations. [sent-61, score-0.173]
</p><p>27 In particular, they can be domain specific, increase the size of the feature space dramatically, and deteriorate more in quality than other features when automatic speech recognition (ASR) is poor. [sent-62, score-0.057]
</p><p>28 More detail about decision detection using DGMs will be presented in section 4. [sent-63, score-0.299]
</p><p>29 Beyond decision detection, DGMs are used for labeling and segmenting sequences of observations in many different fields—including bioinformatics, ASR, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and information extraction. [sent-64, score-0.287]
</p><p>30 Undirected graphical models (UGMs) are also valuable for building probabilistic models for segmenting and labeling sequence data. [sent-72, score-0.232]
</p><p>31 , 2001) and outperform maximum entropy Markov models and HMMs. [sent-74, score-0.053]
</p><p>32 However, the graphical models used in these applications are mainly non-hierarchical, including those in Bui et al. [sent-75, score-0.115]
</p><p>33 (2007) proposed a three-level HGM (in the form of a dynamic CRF) for the joint noun phrase chunking and part of speech labeling problem; they showed that this model performs better than a non-  hierarchical counterpart. [sent-78, score-0.083]
</p><p>34 3  Data  For the experiments reported in this study, we used 17 meetings from the AMI Meeting Corpus1 , a freely available corpus of multi-party meetings with both audio and video recordings, and a wide range of annotated information including DAs and topic segmentation. [sent-79, score-0.17]
</p><p>35 The meetings last around 30 minutes each, and are scenario-driven, wherein four participants play different roles in a company’s design team: project manager, marketing expert, interface designer and industrial designer. [sent-80, score-0.059]
</p><p>36 We use the same annotation scheme as Fern a´ndez et al. [sent-81, score-0.043]
</p><p>37 As stated in section 2, this scheme distinguishes between a small number of DA types based on the role which they perform in the formulation of a decision. [sent-83, score-0.073]
</p><p>38 Besides improving the detection of decision discussions (Fern ´andez et al. [sent-84, score-0.34]
</p><p>39 , 2008), such a scheme also aids in summarization of them, because it indicates which utterances provide particular types of information. [sent-85, score-0.172]
</p><p>40 Hence the scheme distinguishes between three main DDA classes: issue (I), resolution (R), and agreement (A). [sent-87, score-0.22]
</p><p>41 Class R is further subdivided into resolution proposal (RP) and resolution restatement (RR). [sent-88, score-0.164]
</p><p>42 I utterances introduce the topic of the decision discussion, examples being “Are we going to have a backup? [sent-89, score-0.347]

</p><p>50 Unsurprisingly, an utterance may be assigned to more than one DDA class; and within a  decision discussion, more than one utterance can be assigned to the same DDA class. [sent-119, score-0.434]
</p><p>51 We use manual transcripts in the experiments described here. [sent-120, score-0.053]
</p><p>52 Inter-annotator agreement was satisfactory, with kappa values ranging from . [sent-121, score-0.03]

</p><p>56 These include utterance features (UTT) such as length in words2, duration in milliseconds, position within the meeting (as percentage of elapsed time), manually annotated dialogue act (DA) features3 such as inform, assess, suggest, and prosodic features (PROS) such as energy and pitch.

</p><p>65 5  Hierarchical graphical models  Although the results just discussed showed graphical models are better than SVMs for detecting decision dialogue acts (Bui et al. [sent-165, score-0.689]
</p><p>66 , 2009), two-level graphical models like those shown in Figs. [sent-166, score-0.115]
</p><p>67 1and 2  cannot exploit dependencies between high-level discourse items such as decision discussions and DDAs; and the “superclassifier” rule (Bui et al. [sent-167, score-0.378]
</p><p>68 , 2009) used for detecting decision regions did not significantly improve the F1-score for decisions. [sent-168, score-0.459]
</p><p>69 We thus investigate whether HGMs (structured as three or more levels) are superior for discovering the structure and learning the parameters of decision recognition. [sent-169, score-0.218]
</p><p>70 Our approach composes graphical models to increase hierarchy with an additional level above or below previous ones, or inserts a new level such as for discourse topics into the interior of a given model. [sent-170, score-0.22]
</p><p>71 The top level corresponds to high-level discourse regions such as decision discussions. [sent-173, score-0.472]

</p><p>79 The classifier hypothesizes that an utterance belongs to a decision region if the marginal probability of the utterance’s DR node is above a hand-tuned threshold. [sent-191, score-0.48]

</p><p>85 In contrast with the hierarchical SVM and rulebased DGM methods, the HGM method identifies decision-related utterances by exploiting not just DDAs but also direct dependencies between decision regions and UTT, DA, and PROS features. [sent-224, score-0.608]
</p><p>86 As mentioned in the second paragraph of this section,  explicitly modeling the dependency between decision regions and observable features helps to improve detection of decision regions. [sent-225, score-0.747]
</p><p>87 Furthermore, a three-level HGM can straightforwardly model the composition of each high-level decision region as a sequence of mid-level DDA utterances. [sent-226, score-0.303]
</p><p>88 While the hierarchical SVM method can also take dependency between successive utterances into account, it has no principled way to associate this dependency with more extended decision regions. [sent-227, score-0.401]
</p><p>89 In addition, this dependency is only meaningful for lexical features (Fern ´andez et al. [sent-228, score-0.03]

<p>Author: Pierre Lison</p><p>Abstract: Open-ended spoken interactions are typically characterised by both structural complexity and high levels of uncertainty, making dialogue management in such settings a particularly challenging problem. Traditional approaches have focused on providing theoretical accounts for either the uncertainty or the complexity of spoken dialogue, but rarely considered the two issues simultaneously. This paper describes ongoing work on a new approach to dialogue management which attempts to fill this gap. We represent the interaction as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) over a rich state space incorporating both dialogue, user, and environment models. The tractability of the resulting POMDP can be preserved using a mechanism for dynamically constraining the action space based on prior knowledge over locally relevant dialogue structures. These constraints are encoded in a small set of general rules expressed as a Markov Logic network. The first-order expressivity of Markov Logic enables us to leverage the rich relational structure of the problem and efficiently abstract over large regions ofthe state and action spaces.</p><p>3 0.094969705 <a title="81-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Phrase-Based_Statistical_Language_Generation_Using_Graphical_Models_and_Active_Learning.html">194 acl-2010-Phrase-Based Statistical Language Generation Using Graphical Models and Active Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Francois Mairesse ; Milica Gasic ; Filip Jurcicek ; Simon Keizer ; Blaise Thomson ; Kai Yu ; Steve Young</p><p>Abstract: Most previous work on trainable language generation has focused on two paradigms: (a) using a statistical model to rank a set of generated utterances, or (b) using statistics to inform the generation decision process. Both approaches rely on the existence of a handcrafted generator, which limits their scalability to new domains. This paper presents BAGEL, a statistical language generator which uses dynamic Bayesian networks to learn from semantically-aligned data produced by 42 untrained annotators. A human evaluation shows that BAGEL can generate natural and informative utterances from unseen inputs in the information presentation domain. Additionally, generation perfor- mance on sparse datasets is improved significantly by using certainty-based active learning, yielding ratings close to the human gold standard with a fraction of the data.</p><p>4 0.078276053 <a title="81-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Classification_of_Feedback_Expressions_in_Multimodal_Data.html">58 acl-2010-Classification of Feedback Expressions in Multimodal Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Ethan Selfridge ; Peter Heeman</p><p>Abstract: Current turn-taking approaches for spoken dialogue systems rely on the speaker releasing the turn before the other can take it. This reliance results in restricted interactions that can lead to inefficient dialogues. In this paper we present a model we refer to as Importance-Driven Turn-Bidding that treats turn-taking as a negotiative process. Each conversant bids for the turn based on the importance of the intended utterance, and Reinforcement Learning is used to indirectly learn this parameter. We find that Importance-Driven Turn-Bidding performs better than two current turntaking approaches in an artificial collaborative slot-filling domain. The negotiative nature of this model creates efficient dia- logues, and supports the improvement of mixed-initiative interaction.</p><p>6 0.065268688 <a title="81-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Non-Cooperation_in_Dialogue.html">178 acl-2010-Non-Cooperation in Dialogue</a></p>

<p>Author: Trung H. Bui ; Stanley Peters</p><p>Abstract: We investigate hierarchical graphical models (HGMs) for automatically detecting decisions in multi-party discussions. Several types of dialogue act (DA) are distinguished on the basis of their roles in formulating decisions. HGMs enable us to model dependencies between observed features of discussions, decision DAs, and subdialogues that result in a decision. For the task of detecting decision regions, an HGM classifier was found to outperform non-hierarchical graphical models and support vector machines, raising the F1-score to 0.80 from 0.55.</p><p>2 0.76433754 <a title="81-lsi-2" href="./acl-2010-Non-Cooperation_in_Dialogue.html">178 acl-2010-Non-Cooperation in Dialogue</a></p>
<p>Author: Brian Pluss</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents ongoing research on computational models for non-cooperative dialogue. We start by analysing different levels of cooperation in conversation. Then, inspired by findings from an empirical study, we propose a technique for measuring non-cooperation in political interviews. Finally, we describe a research programme towards obtaining a suitable model and discuss previous accounts for conflictive dialogue, identifying the differences with our work.</p><p>3 0.69771075 <a title="81-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-Phrase-Based_Statistical_Language_Generation_Using_Graphical_Models_and_Active_Learning.html">194 acl-2010-Phrase-Based Statistical Language Generation Using Graphical Models and Active Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Francois Mairesse ; Milica Gasic ; Filip Jurcicek ; Simon Keizer ; Blaise Thomson ; Kai Yu ; Steve Young</p><p>Abstract: Most previous work on trainable language generation has focused on two paradigms: (a) using a statistical model to rank a set of generated utterances, or (b) using statistics to inform the generation decision process. Both approaches rely on the existence of a handcrafted generator, which limits their scalability to new domains. This paper presents BAGEL, a statistical language generator which uses dynamic Bayesian networks to learn from semantically-aligned data produced by 42 untrained annotators. A human evaluation shows that BAGEL can generate natural and informative utterances from unseen inputs in the information presentation domain. Additionally, generation perfor- mance on sparse datasets is improved significantly by using certainty-based active learning, yielding ratings close to the human gold standard with a fraction of the data.</p><p>4 0.6777724 <a title="81-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Towards_Relational_POMDPs_for_Adaptive_Dialogue_Management.html">239 acl-2010-Towards Relational POMDPs for Adaptive Dialogue Management</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre Lison</p><p>Abstract: Open-ended spoken interactions are typically characterised by both structural complexity and high levels of uncertainty, making dialogue management in such settings a particularly challenging problem. Traditional approaches have focused on providing theoretical accounts for either the uncertainty or the complexity of spoken dialogue, but rarely considered the two issues simultaneously. This paper describes ongoing work on a new approach to dialogue management which attempts to fill this gap. We represent the interaction as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) over a rich state space incorporating both dialogue, user, and environment models. The tractability of the resulting POMDP can be preserved using a mechanism for dynamically constraining the action space based on prior knowledge over locally relevant dialogue structures. These constraints are encoded in a small set of general rules expressed as a Markov Logic network. The first-order expressivity of Markov Logic enables us to leverage the rich relational structure of the problem and efficiently abstract over large regions ofthe state and action spaces.</p><p>5 0.6621688 <a title="81-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Classification_of_Feedback_Expressions_in_Multimodal_Data.html">58 acl-2010-Classification of Feedback Expressions in Multimodal Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Josef Steinberger ; Marco Turchi ; Mijail Kabadjov ; Ralf Steinberger ; Nello Cristianini</p><p>Abstract: The main focus of this work is to investigate robust ways for generating summaries from summary representations without recurring to simple sentence extraction and aiming at more human-like summaries. This is motivated by empirical evidence from TAC 2009 data showing that human summaries contain on average more and shorter sentences than the system summaries. We report encouraging preliminary results comparable to those attained by participating systems at TAC 2009.</p><p>3 0.46264905 <a title="81-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Hierarchical_Search_for_Word_Alignment.html">133 acl-2010-Hierarchical Search for Word Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Riesa ; Daniel Marcu</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple yet powerful hierarchical search algorithm for automatic word alignment. Our algorithm induces a forest of alignments from which we can efficiently extract a ranked k-best list. We score a given alignment within the forest with a flexible, linear discriminative model incorporating hundreds of features, and trained on a relatively small amount of annotated data. We report results on Arabic-English word alignment and translation tasks. Our model outperforms a GIZA++ Model-4 baseline by 6.3 points in F-measure, yielding a 1.1 BLEU score increase over a state-of-the-art syntax-based machine translation system.</p><p>4 0.43476561 <a title="81-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-%22Ask_Not_What_Textual_Entailment_Can_Do_for_You...%22.html">1 acl-2010-"Ask Not What Textual Entailment Can Do for You..."</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark Sammons ; V.G.Vinod Vydiswaran ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: We challenge the NLP community to participate in a large-scale, distributed effort to design and build resources for developing and evaluating solutions to new and existing NLP tasks in the context of Recognizing Textual Entailment. We argue that the single global label with which RTE examples are annotated is insufficient to effectively evaluate RTE system performance; to promote research on smaller, related NLP tasks, we believe more detailed annotation and evaluation are needed, and that this effort will benefit not just RTE researchers, but the NLP community as a whole. We use insights from successful RTE systems to propose a model for identifying and annotating textual infer- ence phenomena in textual entailment examples, and we present the results of a pilot annotation study that show this model is feasible and the results immediately useful.</p><p>5 0.42774647 <a title="81-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Coreference_Resolution_with_Reconcile.html">73 acl-2010-Coreference Resolution with Reconcile</a></p>
<p>Author: Veselin Stoyanov ; Claire Cardie ; Nathan Gilbert ; Ellen Riloff ; David Buttler ; David Hysom</p><p>Abstract: Despite the existence of several noun phrase coreference resolution data sets as well as several formal evaluations on the task, it remains frustratingly difficult to compare results across different coreference resolution systems. This is due to the high cost of implementing a complete end-to-end coreference resolution system, which often forces researchers to substitute available gold-standard information in lieu of implementing a module that would compute that information. Unfortunately, this leads to inconsistent and often unrealistic evaluation scenarios. With the aim to facilitate consistent and realistic experimental evaluations in coreference resolution, we present Reconcile, an infrastructure for the development of learning-based noun phrase (NP) coreference resolution systems. Reconcile is designed to facilitate the rapid creation of coreference resolution systems, easy implementation of new feature sets and approaches to coreference res- olution, and empirical evaluation of coreference resolvers across a variety of benchmark data sets and standard scoring metrics. We describe Reconcile and present experimental results showing that Reconcile can be used to create a coreference resolver that achieves performance comparable to state-ofthe-art systems on six benchmark data sets.</p><p>6 0.4235712 <a title="81-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Entity-Based_Local_Coherence_Modelling_Using_Topological_Fields.html">101 acl-2010-Entity-Based Local Coherence Modelling Using Topological Fields</a></p>

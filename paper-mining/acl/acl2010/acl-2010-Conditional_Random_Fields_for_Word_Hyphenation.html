<p>Author: Dong Yang ; Paul Dixon ; Sadaoki Furui</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a joint optimization method of a two-step conditional random field (CRF) model for machine transliteration and a fast decoding algorithm for the proposed method. Our method lies in the category of direct orthographical mapping (DOM) between two languages without using any intermediate phonemic mapping. In the two-step CRF model, the first CRF segments an input word into chunks and the second one converts each chunk into one unit in the target language. In this paper, we propose a method to jointly optimize the two-step CRFs and also a fast algorithm to realize it. Our experiments show that the proposed method outper- forms the well-known joint source channel model (JSCM) and our proposed fast algorithm decreases the decoding time significantly. Furthermore, combination of the proposed method and the JSCM gives further improvement, which outperforms state-of-the-art results in terms of top-1 accuracy.</p><p>3 0.057153806 <a title="68-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Hierarchical_Joint_Learning%3A_Improving_Joint_Parsing_and_Named_Entity_Recognition_with_Non-Jointly_Labeled_Data.html">132 acl-2010-Hierarchical Joint Learning: Improving Joint Parsing and Named Entity Recognition with Non-Jointly Labeled Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Jenny Rose Finkel ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: One of the main obstacles to producing high quality joint models is the lack of jointly annotated data. Joint modeling of multiple natural language processing tasks outperforms single-task models learned from the same data, but still underperforms compared to single-task models learned on the more abundant quantities of available single-task annotated data. In this paper we present a novel model which makes use of additional single-task annotated data to improve the performance of a joint model. Our model utilizes a hierarchical prior to link the feature weights for shared features in several single-task models and the joint model. Experiments on joint parsing and named entity recog- nition, using the OntoNotes corpus, show that our hierarchical joint model can produce substantial gains over a joint model trained on only the jointly annotated data.</p><p>4 0.055339739 <a title="68-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Word_Representations%3A_A_Simple_and_General_Method_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">263 acl-2010-Word Representations: A Simple and General Method for Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Joseph Turian ; Lev-Arie Ratinov ; Yoshua Bengio</p><p>Abstract: If we take an existing supervised NLP system, a simple and general way to improve accuracy is to use unsupervised word representations as extra word features. We evaluate Brown clusters, Collobert and Weston (2008) embeddings, and HLBL (Mnih & Hinton, 2009) embeddings of words on both NER and chunking. We use near state-of-the-art supervised baselines, and find that each of the three word representations improves the accuracy of these baselines. We find further improvements by combining different word representations. You can download our word features, for off-the-shelf use in existing NLP systems, as well as our code, here: http ://metaoptimize com/proj ects/wordreprs/ .</p><p>5 0.049621701 <a title="68-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-On_Learning_Subtypes_of_the_Part-Whole_Relation%3A_Do_Not_Mix_Your_Seeds.html">181 acl-2010-On Learning Subtypes of the Part-Whole Relation: Do Not Mix Your Seeds</a></p>
<p>Author: Ashwin Ittoo ; Gosse Bouma</p><p>Abstract: An important relation in information extraction is the part-whole relation. Ontological studies mention several types of this relation. In this paper, we show that the traditional practice of initializing minimally-supervised algorithms with a single set that mixes seeds of different types fails to capture the wide variety of part-whole patterns and tuples. The results obtained with mixed seeds ultimately converge to one of the part-whole relation types. We also demonstrate that all the different types of part-whole relations can still be discovered, regardless of the type characterized by the initializing seeds. We performed our experiments with a state-ofthe-art information extraction algorithm. 1</p><p>6 0.04806431 <a title="68-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Open-Domain_Semantic_Role_Labeling_by_Modeling_Word_Spans.html">184 acl-2010-Open-Domain Semantic Role Labeling by Modeling Word Spans</a></p>

<p>Author: Nadir Durrani ; Hassan Sajjad ; Alexander Fraser ; Helmut Schmid</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to integrate transliteration into Hindi-to-Urdu statistical machine translation. We propose two probabilistic models, based on conditional and joint probability formulations, that are novel solutions to the problem. Our models consider both transliteration and translation when translating a particular Hindi word given the context whereas in previous work transliteration is only used for translating OOV (out-of-vocabulary) words. We use transliteration as a tool for disambiguation of Hindi homonyms which can be both translated or transliterated or transliterated differently based on different contexts. We obtain final BLEU scores of 19.35 (conditional prob- ability model) and 19.00 (joint probability model) as compared to 14.30 for a baseline phrase-based system and 16.25 for a system which transliterates OOV words in the baseline system. This indicates that transliteration is useful for more than only translating OOV words for language pairs like Hindi-Urdu.</p><p>4 0.48489165 <a title="68-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Efficient_Staggered_Decoding_for_Sequence_Labeling.html">98 acl-2010-Efficient Staggered Decoding for Sequence Labeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Nobuhiro Kaji ; Yasuhiro Fujiwara ; Naoki Yoshinaga ; Masaru Kitsuregawa</p><p>Abstract: The Viterbi algorithm is the conventional decoding algorithm most widely adopted for sequence labeling. Viterbi decoding is, however, prohibitively slow when the label set is large, because its time complexity is quadratic in the number of labels. This paper proposes an exact decoding algorithm that overcomes this problem. A novel property of our algorithm is that it efficiently reduces the labels to be decoded, while still allowing us to check the optimality of the solution. Experiments on three tasks (POS tagging, joint POS tagging and chunking, and supertagging) show that the new algorithm is several orders of magnitude faster than the basic Viterbi and a state-of-the-art algo- rithm, CARPEDIEM (Esposito and Radicioni, 2009).</p><p>5 0.4414134 <a title="68-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Extracting_Sequences_from_the_Web.html">111 acl-2010-Extracting Sequences from the Web</a></p>

<p>Author: Thin Nguyen</p><p>Abstract: The emergence of social media brings chances, but also challenges, to linguistic analysis. In this paper we investigate a novel problem of discovering patterns based on emotion and the association of moods and affective lexicon usage in blogosphere, a representative for social media. We propose the use ofnormative emotional scores for English words in combination with a psychological model of emotion measurement and a nonparametric clustering process for inferring meaningful emotion patterns automatically from data. Our results on a dataset consisting of more than 17 million mood-groundtruthed blogposts have shown interesting evidence of the emotion patterns automatically discovered that match well with the core- affect emotion model theorized by psychologists. We then present a method based on information theory to discover the association of moods and affective lexicon usage in the new media.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.75316542 <a title="68-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Conditional_Random_Fields_for_Word_Hyphenation.html">68 acl-2010-Conditional Random Fields for Word Hyphenation</a></p>

In addition, the introduction of various loss functions also provides the summarization framework with a flexible but systematic way to render the redundancy and coherence relationships among sentences and between sentences and the whole document, respectively. Experiments on speech summarization show that the methods deduced from our framework are very competitive with existing summarization approaches. 1</p><p>4 0.65021408 <a title="68-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Faster_Parsing_by_Supertagger_Adaptation.html">114 acl-2010-Faster Parsing by Supertagger Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan K. Kummerfeld ; Jessika Roesner ; Tim Dawborn ; James Haggerty ; James R. Curran ; Stephen Clark</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel self-training method for a parser which uses a lexicalised grammar and supertagger, focusing on increasing the speed of the parser rather than its accuracy. The idea is to train the supertagger on large amounts of parser output, so that the supertagger can learn to supply the supertags that the parser will eventually choose as part of the highestscoring derivation. Since the supertagger supplies fewer supertags overall, the parsing speed is increased. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method using a CCG supertagger and parser, obtain- ing significant speed increases on newspaper text with no loss in accuracy. We also show that the method can be used to adapt the CCG parser to new domains, obtaining accuracy and speed improvements for Wikipedia and biomedical text.</p><p>5 0.59487212 <a title="68-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Letter-Phoneme_Alignment%3A_An_Exploration.html">170 acl-2010-Letter-Phoneme Alignment: An Exploration</a></p>
<p>Author: Sittichai Jiampojamarn ; Grzegorz Kondrak</p><p>Abstract: Letter-phoneme alignment is usually generated by a straightforward application of the EM algorithm. We explore several alternative alignment methods that employ phonetics, integer programming, and sets of constraints, and propose a novel approach of refining the EM alignment by aggregation of best alignments. We perform both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of the assortment of methods. We show that our proposed EM-Aggregation algorithm leads to the improvement of the state of the art in letter-to-phoneme conversion on several different data sets.</p><p>6 0.59336251 <a title="68-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Hierarchical_Joint_Learning%3A_Improving_Joint_Parsing_and_Named_Entity_Recognition_with_Non-Jointly_Labeled_Data.html">132 acl-2010-Hierarchical Joint Learning: Improving Joint Parsing and Named Entity Recognition with Non-Jointly Labeled Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Adam Vogel ; Dan Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: We present a system that learns to follow navigational natural language directions. Where traditional models learn from linguistic annotation or word distributions, our approach is grounded in the world, learning by apprenticeship from routes through a map paired with English descriptions. Lacking an explicit alignment between the text and the reference path makes it difficult to determine what portions of the language describe which aspects of the route. We learn this correspondence with a reinforcement learning algorithm, using the deviation of the route we follow from the intended path as a reward signal. We demonstrate that our system successfully grounds the meaning of spatial terms like above and south into geometric properties of paths.</p><p>3 0.19497965 <a title="35-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Reading_between_the_Lines%3A_Learning_to_Map_High-Level_Instructions_to_Commands.html">202 acl-2010-Reading between the Lines: Learning to Map High-Level Instructions to Commands</a></p>

<p>Author: Ryu Iida ; Syumpei Kobayashi ; Takenobu Tokunaga</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an approach to reference resolution in situated dialogues by exploiting extra-linguistic information. Recently, investigations of referential behaviours involved in situations in the real world have received increasing attention by researchers (Di Eugenio et al., 2000; Byron, 2005; van Deemter, 2007; Spanger et al., 2009). In order to create an accurate reference resolution model, we need to handle extra-linguistic information as well as textual information examined by existing approaches (Soon et al., 2001 ; Ng and Cardie, 2002, etc.). In this paper, we incorporate extra-linguistic information into an existing corpus-based reference resolution model, and investigate its effects on refer- ence resolution problems within a corpus of Japanese dialogues. The results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves an accuracy of 79.0% for this task.</p><p>5 0.088119693 <a title="35-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-The_Prevalence_of_Descriptive_Referring_Expressions_in_News_and_Narrative.html">231 acl-2010-The Prevalence of Descriptive Referring Expressions in News and Narrative</a></p>
<p>Author: Raquel Hervas ; Mark Finlayson</p><p>Abstract: Generating referring expressions is a key step in Natural Language Generation. Researchers have focused almost exclusively on generating distinctive referring expressions, that is, referring expressions that uniquely identify their intended referent. While undoubtedly one of their most important functions, referring expressions can be more than distinctive. In particular, descriptive referring expressions those that provide additional information not required for distinction are critical to flu– – ent, efficient, well-written text. We present a corpus analysis in which approximately one-fifth of 7,207 referring expressions in 24,422 words ofnews and narrative are descriptive. These data show that if we are ever to fully master natural language generation, especially for the genres of news and narrative, researchers will need to devote more attention to understanding how to generate descriptive, and not just distinctive, referring expressions. 1 A Distinctive Focus Generating referring expressions is a key step in Natural Language Generation (NLG). From early treatments in seminal papers by Appelt (1985) and Reiter and Dale (1992) to the recent set of Referring Expression Generation (REG) Challenges (Gatt et al., 2009) through different corpora available for the community (Eugenio et al., 1998; van Deemter et al., 2006; Viethen and Dale, 2008), generating referring expressions has become one of the most studied areas of NLG. Researchers studying this area have, almost without exception, focused exclusively on how to generate distinctive referring expressions, that is, referring expressions that unambiguously idenMark Alan Finlayson Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge, MA, 02139 USA markaf@mit .edu tify their intended referent. Referring expressions, however, may be more than distinctive. It is widely acknowledged that they can be used to achieve multiple goals, above and beyond distinction. Here we focus on descriptive referring expressions, that is, referring expressions that are not only distinctive, but provide additional information not required for identifying their intended referent. Consider the following text, in which some of the referring expressions have been underlined: Once upon a time there was a man, who had three daughters. They lived in a house and their dresses were made of fabric. While a bit strange, the text is perfectly wellformed. All the referring expressions are distinctive, in that we can properly identify the referents of each expression. But the real text, the opening lines to the folktale The Beauty and the Beast, is actually much more lyrical: Once upon a time there was a rich merchant, who had three daughters. They lived in a very fine house and their gowns were made of the richest fabric sewn with jewels. All the boldfaced portions namely, the choice of head nouns, the addition of adjectives, the use of appositive phrases serve to perform a descriptive function, and, importantly, are all unnecessary for distinction! In all of these cases, the author is using the referring expressions as a vehicle for communicating information about the referents. This descriptive information is sometimes – – new, sometimes necessary for understanding the text, and sometimes just for added flavor. But when the expression is descriptive, as opposed to distinctive, this additional information is not required for identifying the referent of the expression, and it is these sorts of referring expressions that we will be concerned with here. 49 Uppsala,P Srwoce de dni,n 1g1s- 1of6 t Jhuely AC 20L1 20 .1 ?0c 2 C0o1n0fe Aresnsoceci Sathio rnt f Poarp Ceorsm,p paugteastio 4n9a–l5 L4i,nguistics Although these sorts of referring expression have been mostly ignored by researchers in this area1 , we show in this corpus study that descriptive expressions are in fact quite prevalent: nearly one-fifth of referring expressions in news and narrative are descriptive. In particular, our data, the trained judgments of native English speakers, show that 18% of all distinctive referring expressions in news and 17% of those in narrative folktales are descriptive. With this as motivation, we argue that descriptive referring expressions must be studied more carefully, especially as the field progresses from referring in a physical, immediate context (like that in the REG Challenges) to generating more literary forms of text. 2 Corpus Annotation This is a corpus study; our procedure was therefore to define our annotation guidelines (Section 2.1), select texts to annotate (2.2), create an annotation tool for our annotators (2.3), and, finally, train annotators, have them annotate referring expressions’ constituents and function, and then adjudicate the double-annotated texts into a gold standard (2.4). 2.1 Definitions We wrote an annotation guide explaining the difference between distinctive and descriptive referring expressions. We used the guide when training annotators, and it was available to them while annotating. With limited space here we can only give an outline of what is contained in the guide; for full details see (Finlayson and Herv a´s, 2010a). Referring Expressions We defined referring expressions as referential noun phrases and their coreferential expressions, e.g., “John kissed Mary. She blushed.”. This included referring expressions to generics (e.g., “Lions are fierce”), dates, times, and numbers, as well as events if they were referred to using a noun phrase. We included in each referring expression all the determiners, quantifiers, adjectives, appositives, and prepositional phrases that syntactically attached to that expression. When referring expressions were nested, all the nested referring expressions were also marked separately. Nuclei vs. Modifiers In the only previous corpus study of descriptive referring expressions, on 1With the exception of a small amount of work, discussed in Section 4. museum labels, Cheng et al. (2001) noted that descriptive information is often integrated into referring expressions using modifiers to the head noun. To study this, and to allow our results to be more closely compared with Cheng’s, we had our annotators split referring expressions into their constituents, portions called either nuclei or modifiers. The nuclei were the portions of the referring expression that performed the ‘core’ referring function; the modifiers were those portions that could be varied, syntactically speaking, independently of the nuclei. Annotators then assigned a distinctive or descriptive function to each constituent, rather than the referring expression as a whole. Normally, the nuclei corresponded to the head of the noun phrase. In (1), the nucleus is the token king, which we have here surrounded with square brackets. The modifiers, surrounded by parentheses, are The and old. (1) (The) (old) [king] was wise. Phrasal modifiers were marked as single modifiers, for example, in (2). (2) (The) [roof] (of the house) collapsed. It is significant that we had our annotators mark and tag the nuclei of referring expressions. Cheng and colleagues only mentioned the possibility that additional information could be introduced in the modifiers. However, O’Donnell et al. (1998) observed that often the choice of head noun can also influence the function of a referring expression. Consider (3), in which the word villain is used to refer to the King. (3) The King assumed the throne today. I ’t trust (that) [villain] one bit. don The speaker could have merely used him to refer to the King–the choice of that particular head noun villain gives us additional information about the disposition of the speaker. Thus villain is descriptive. Function: Distinctive vs. Descriptive As already noted, instead of tagging the whole referring expression, annotators tagged each constituent (nuclei and modifiers) as distinctive or descriptive. The two main tests for determining descriptiveness were (a) if presence of the constituent was unnecessary for identifying the referent, or (b) if 50 the constituent was expressed using unusual or ostentatious word choice. If either was true, the constituent was considered descriptive; otherwise, it was tagged as distinctive. In cases where the constituent was completely irrelevant to identifying the referent, it was tagged as descriptive. For example, in the folktale The Princess and the Pea, from which (1) was extracted, there is only one king in the entire story. Thus, in that story, the king is sufficient for identification, and therefore the modifier old is descriptive. This points out the importance of context in determining distinctiveness or descriptiveness; if there had been a roomful of kings, the tags on those modifiers would have been reversed. There is some question as to whether copular predicates, such as the plumber in (4), are actually referring expressions. (4) John is the plumber Our annotators marked and tagged these constructions as normal referring expressions, but they added an additional flag to identify them as copular predicates. We then excluded these constructions from our final analysis. Note that copular predicates were treated differently from appositives: in appositives the predicate was included in the referring expression, and in most cases (again, depending on context) was marked descriptive (e.g., John, the plumber, slept.). 2.2 Text Selection Our corpus comprised 62 texts, all originally written in English, from two different genres, news and folktales. We began with 30 folktales of different sizes, totaling 12,050 words. These texts were used in a previous work on the influence of dialogues on anaphora resolution algorithms (Aggarwal et al., 2009); they were assembled with an eye toward including different styles, different authors, and different time periods. Following this, we matched, approximately, the number of words in the folktales by selecting 32 texts from Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993). These texts were selected at ran- dom from the first 200 texts in the corpus. 2.3 The Story Workbench We used the Story Workbench application (Finlayson, 2008) to actually perform the annotation. The Story Workbench is a semantic annotation program that, among other things, includes the ability to annotate referring expressions and coreferential relationships. We added the ability to annotate nuclei, modifiers, and their functions by writing a workbench “plugin” in Java that could be installed in the application. The Story Workbench is not yet available to the public at large, being in a limited distribution beta testing phase. The developers plan to release it as free software within the next year. At that time, we also plan to release our plugin as free, downloadable software. 2.4 Annotation & Adjudication The main task of the study was the annotation of the constituents of each referring expression, as well as the function (distinctive or descriptive) of each constituent. The system generated a first pass of constituent analysis, but did not mark functions. We hired two native English annotators, neither of whom had any linguistics background, who corrected these automatically-generated constituent analyses, and tagged each constituent as descriptive or distinctive. Every text was annotated by both annotators. Adjudication of the differences was conducted by discussion between the two annotators; the second author moderated these discussions and settled irreconcilable disagreements. We followed a “train-as-you-go” paradigm, where there was no distinct training period, but rather adjudication proceeded in step with annotation, and annotators received feedback during those sessions. We calculated two measures of inter-annotator agreement: a kappa statistic and an f-measure, shown in Table 1. All of our f-measures indicated that annotators agreed almost perfectly on the location of referring expressions and their breakdown into constituents. These agreement calculations were performed on the annotators’ original corrected texts. All the kappa statistics were calculated for two tags (nuclei vs. modifier for the constituents, and distinctive vs. descriptive for the functions) over both each token assigned to a nucleus or modifier and each referring expression pair. Our kappas indicate moderate to good agreement, especially for the folktales. These results are expected because of the inherent subjectivity of language. During the adjudication sessions it became clear that different people do not consider the same information 51 as obvious or descriptive for the same concepts, and even the contexts deduced by each annotators from the texts were sometimes substantially different. 3 Results Table 2 lists the primary results of the study. We considered a referring expression descriptive if any of its constituents were descriptive. Thus, 18% of the referring expressions in the corpus added additional information beyond what was required to unambiguously identify their referent. The results were similar in both genres.

Like Cheng’s results, our analysis shows that descriptive referring expressions make up a significant fraction of all referring expressions. Although Cheng did not examine nuclei, our results show that the use of descriptive nuclei is small but not negligible. 4 Relation to the Field Researchers working on generating referring expressions typically acknowledge that referring expressions can perform functions other than distinction. Despite this widespread acknowledgment, researchers have, for the most part, explicitly ignored these functions. Exceptions to this trend Tales Articles Total Nuclei3,6663,5027,168 Max. Nuc/Ref Dist.

Second and third are corpus studies by Cheng et al. (2001) and Jordan (2000a) that bear on the prevalence of descriptive referring expressions. The NLG subtask of aggregation can be used to imbue referring expressions with a descriptive function (Reiter and Dale, 2000, §5.3). There is a specific nk (iRned otefr aggregation 0c0al0le,d § embedding t ihsa at moves information from one clause to another inside the structure of a separate noun phrase. This type of aggregation can be used to transform two sentences such as “The princess lived in a castle. She was pretty ” into “The pretty princess lived in a castle ”. The adjective pretty, previously a cop- ular predicate, becomes a descriptive modifier of the reference to the princess, making the second text more natural and fluent. This kind of aggregation is widely used by humans for making the discourse more compact and efficient. In order to create NLG systems with this ability, we must take into account the caveat, noted by Cheng (1998), that any non-distinctive information in a referring expression must not lead to confusion about the distinctive function of the referring expression. This is by no means a trivial problem this sort of aggregation interferes with referring and coherence planning at both a local and global level (Cheng and Mellish, 2000; Cheng et al., 2001). It is clear, from the current state of the art of NLG, that we have not yet obtained a deep enough understanding of aggregation to enable us to handle these interactions. More research on the topic is needed. Two previous corpus studies have looked at the use of descriptive referring expressions. The first showed explicitly that people craft descriptive referring expressions to accomplish different – 52 goals. Jordan and colleagues (Jordan, 2000b; Jordan, 2000a) examined the use of referring expressions using the COCONUT corpus (Eugenio et al., 1998). They tested how domain and discourse goals can influence the content of non-pronominal referring expressions in a dialogue context, checking whether or not a subject’s goals led them to include non-referring information in a referring expression. Their results are intriguing because they point toward heretofore unexamined constraints, utilities and expectations (possibly genre- or styledependent) that may underlie the use ofdescriptive information to perform different functions, and are not yet captured by aggregation modules in particular or NLG systems in general. In the other corpus study, which partially inspired this work, Cheng and colleagues analyzed a set of museum descriptions, the GNOME corpus (Poesio, 2004), for the pragmatic functions of referring expressions. They had three functions in their study, in contrast to our two. Their first function (marked by their uniq tag) was equiv- alent to our distinctive function. The other two were specializations of our descriptive tag, where they differentiated between additional information that helped to understand the text (int), or additional information not necessary for understanding (att r). Despite their annotators seeming to have trouble distinguishing between the latter two tags, they did achieve good overall inter-annotator agreement. They identified 1,863 modifiers to referring expressions in their corpus, of which 47.3% fulfilled a descriptive (att r or int) function. This is supportive of our main assertion, namely, that descriptive referring expressions, not only crucial for efficient and fluent text, are actually a significant phenomenon. It is interesting, though, that Cheng’s fraction of descriptive referring expression was so much higher than ours (47.3% versus our 18%). We attribute this substantial difference to genre, in that Cheng studied museum labels, in which the writer is spaceconstrained, having to pack a lot of information into a small label. The issue bears further study, and perhaps will lead to insights into differences in writing style that may be attributed to author or genre. 5 Contributions We make two contributions in this paper. First, we assembled, double-annotated, and adjudicated into a gold-standard a corpus of 24,422 words. We marked all referring expressions, coreferential relations, and referring expression constituents, and tagged each constituent as having a descriptive or distinctive function. We wrote an annotation guide and created software that allows the annotation of this information in free text. The corpus and the guide are available on-line in a permanent digital archive (Finlayson and Herv a´s, 2010a; Finlayson and Herv a´s, 2010b). The software will also be released in the same archive when the Story Workbench annotation application is released to the public. This corpus will be useful for the automatic generation and analysis of both descriptive and distinctive referring expressions. Any kind of system intended to generate text as humans do must take into account that identifica- tion is not the only function of referring expressions. Many analysis applications would benefit from the automatic recognition of descriptive referring expressions. Second, we demonstrated that descriptive referring expressions comprise a substantial fraction (18%) of the referring expressions in news and narrative. Along with museum descriptions, studied by Cheng, it seems that news and narrative are genres where authors naturally use a large number ofdescriptive referring expressions. Given that so little work has been done on descriptive referring expressions, this indicates that the field would be well served by focusing more attention on this phenomenon.

<p>Author: S.R.K. Branavan ; Luke Zettlemoyer ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the task of mapping high-level instructions to sequences of commands in an external environment. Processing these instructions is challenging—they posit goals to be achieved without specifying the steps required to complete them. We describe a method that fills in missing information using an automatically derived environment model that encodes states, transitions, and commands that cause these transitions to happen. We present an efficient approximate approach for learning this environment model as part of a policygradient reinforcement learning algorithm for text interpretation. This design enables learning for mapping high-level instructions, which previous statistical methods cannot handle.1</p><p>3 0.79043192 <a title="35-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-Learning_to_Follow_Navigational_Directions.html">168 acl-2010-Learning to Follow Navigational Directions</a></p>
<p>Author: Adam Vogel ; Dan Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: We present a system that learns to follow navigational natural language directions. Where traditional models learn from linguistic annotation or word distributions, our approach is grounded in the world, learning by apprenticeship from routes through a map paired with English descriptions. Lacking an explicit alignment between the text and the reference path makes it difficult to determine what portions of the language describe which aspects of the route. We learn this correspondence with a reinforcement learning algorithm, using the deviation of the route we follow from the intended path as a reward signal. We demonstrate that our system successfully grounds the meaning of spatial terms like above and south into geometric properties of paths.</p><p>4 0.50926495 <a title="35-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Learning_to_Adapt_to_Unknown_Users%3A_Referring_Expression_Generation_in_Spoken_Dialogue_Systems.html">167 acl-2010-Learning to Adapt to Unknown Users: Referring Expression Generation in Spoken Dialogue Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Srinivasan Janarthanam ; Oliver Lemon</p><p>Abstract: We present a data-driven approach to learn user-adaptive referring expression generation (REG) policies for spoken dialogue systems. Referring expressions can be difficult to understand in technical domains where users may not know the technical ‘jargon’ names of the domain entities. In such cases, dialogue systems must be able to model the user’s (lexical) domain knowledge and use appropriate referring expressions. We present a reinforcement learning (RL) framework in which the sys- tem learns REG policies which can adapt to unknown users online. Furthermore, unlike supervised learning methods which require a large corpus of expert adaptive behaviour to train on, we show that effective adaptive policies can be learned from a small dialogue corpus of non-adaptive human-machine interaction, by using a RL framework and a statistical user simulation. We show that in comparison to adaptive hand-coded baseline policies, the learned policy performs significantly better, with an 18.6% average increase in adaptation accuracy. The best learned policy also takes less dialogue time (average 1.07 min less) than the best hand-coded policy. This is because the learned policies can adapt online to changing evidence about the user’s domain expertise.</p><p>5 0.43318385 <a title="35-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Now%2C_Where_Was_I%3F_Resumption_Strategies_for_an_In-Vehicle_Dialogue_System.html">179 acl-2010-Now, Where Was I? Resumption Strategies for an In-Vehicle Dialogue System</a></p>
<p>Author: Jessica Villing</p><p>Abstract: In-vehicle dialogue systems often contain more than one application, e.g. a navigation and a telephone application. This means that the user might, for example, interrupt the interaction with the telephone application to ask for directions from the navigation application, and then resume the dialogue with the telephone application. In this paper we present an analysis of interruption and resumption behaviour in human-human in-vehicle dialogues and also propose some implications for resumption strategies in an in-vehicle dialogue system.</p><p>6 0.38691494 <a title="35-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-The_Prevalence_of_Descriptive_Referring_Expressions_in_News_and_Narrative.html">231 acl-2010-The Prevalence of Descriptive Referring Expressions in News and Narrative</a></p>

<p>Author: Sebastian Spiegler ; Peter A. Flach</p><p>Abstract: This paper demonstrates that the use of ensemble methods and carefully calibrating the decision threshold can significantly improve the performance of machine learning methods for morphological word decomposition. We employ two algorithms which come from a family of generative probabilistic models. The models consider segment boundaries as hidden variables and include probabilities for letter transitions within segments. The advantage of this model family is that it can learn from small datasets and easily gen- eralises to larger datasets. The first algorithm PROMODES, which participated in the Morpho Challenge 2009 (an international competition for unsupervised morphological analysis) employs a lower order model whereas the second algorithm PROMODES-H is a novel development of the first using a higher order model. We present the mathematical description for both algorithms, conduct experiments on the morphologically rich language Zulu and compare characteristics of both algorithms based on the experimental results.</p><p>3 0.72081685 <a title="35-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-A_Taxonomy%2C_Dataset%2C_and_Classifier_for_Automatic_Noun_Compound_Interpretation.html">19 acl-2010-A Taxonomy, Dataset, and Classifier for Automatic Noun Compound Interpretation</a></p>
<p>Author: Stephen Tratz ; Eduard Hovy</p><p>Abstract: The automatic interpretation of noun-noun compounds is an important subproblem within many natural language processing applications and is an area of increasing interest. The problem is difficult, with disagreement regarding the number and nature of the relations, low inter-annotator agreement, and limited annotated data. In this paper, we present a novel taxonomy of relations that integrates previous relations, the largest publicly-available annotated dataset, and a supervised classification method for automatic noun compound interpretation.</p><p>4 0.69677842 <a title="35-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Unsupervised_Ontology_Induction_from_Text.html">248 acl-2010-Unsupervised Ontology Induction from Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Hoifung Poon ; Pedro Domingos</p><p>Abstract: Extracting knowledge from unstructured text is a long-standing goal of NLP. Although learning approaches to many of its subtasks have been developed (e.g., parsing, taxonomy induction, information extraction), all end-to-end solutions to date require heavy supervision and/or manual engineering, limiting their scope and scalability. We present OntoUSP, a system that induces and populates a probabilistic ontology using only dependency-parsed text as input. OntoUSP builds on the USP unsupervised semantic parser by jointly forming ISA and IS-PART hierarchies of lambda-form clusters. The ISA hierarchy allows more general knowledge to be learned, and the use of smoothing for parameter estimation. We evaluate On- toUSP by using it to extract a knowledge base from biomedical abstracts and answer questions. OntoUSP improves on the recall of USP by 47% and greatly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches.</p><p>5 0.67041403 <a title="35-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Event-Based_Hyperspace_Analogue_to_Language_for_Query_Expansion.html">106 acl-2010-Event-Based Hyperspace Analogue to Language for Query Expansion</a></p>
<p>Author: Tingxu Yan ; Tamsin Maxwell ; Dawei Song ; Yuexian Hou ; Peng Zhang</p><p>Abstract: p . zhang1 @ rgu .ac .uk Bag-of-words approaches to information retrieval (IR) are effective but assume independence between words. The Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) is a cognitively motivated and validated semantic space model that captures statistical dependencies between words by considering their co-occurrences in a surrounding window of text. HAL has been successfully applied to query expansion in IR, but has several limitations, including high processing cost and use of distributional statistics that do not exploit syntax. In this paper, we pursue two methods for incorporating syntactic-semantic information from textual ‘events’ into HAL. We build the HAL space directly from events to investigate whether processing costs can be reduced through more careful definition of word co-occurrence, and improve the quality of the pseudo-relevance feedback by applying event information as a constraint during HAL construction. Both methods significantly improve performance results in comparison with original HAL, and interpolation of HAL and relevance model expansion outperforms either method alone.</p><p>6 0.55248833 <a title="35-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Reading_between_the_Lines%3A_Learning_to_Map_High-Level_Instructions_to_Commands.html">202 acl-2010-Reading between the Lines: Learning to Map High-Level Instructions to Commands</a></p>

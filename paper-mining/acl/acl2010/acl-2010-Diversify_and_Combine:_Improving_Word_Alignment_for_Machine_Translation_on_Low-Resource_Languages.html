<p>Author: Jason Riesa ; Daniel Marcu</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple yet powerful hierarchical search algorithm for automatic word alignment. Our algorithm induces a forest of alignments from which we can efficiently extract a ranked k-best list. We score a given alignment within the forest with a flexible, linear discriminative model incorporating hundreds of features, and trained on a relatively small amount of annotated data. We report results on Arabic-English word alignment and translation tasks. Our model outperforms a GIZA++ Model-4 baseline by 6.3 points in F-measure, yielding a 1.1 BLEU score increase over a state-of-the-art syntax-based machine translation system.</p><p>3 0.48298725 <a title="90-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Active_Learning-Based_Elicitation_for_Semi-Supervised_Word_Alignment.html">24 acl-2010-Active Learning-Based Elicitation for Semi-Supervised Word Alignment</a></p>

<p>Author: Laura Chiticariu ; Rajasekar Krishnamurthy ; Yunyao Li ; Sriram Raghavan ; Frederick Reiss ; Shivakumar Vaithyanathan</p><p>Abstract: As information extraction (IE) becomes more central to enterprise applications, rule-based IE engines have become increasingly important. In this paper, we describe SystemT, a rule-based IE system whose basic design removes the expressivity and performance limitations of current systems based on cascading grammars. SystemT uses a declarative rule language, AQL, and an optimizer that generates high-performance algebraic execution plans for AQL rules. We compare SystemT’s approach against cascading grammars, both theoretically and with a thorough experimental evaluation. Our results show that SystemT can deliver result quality comparable to the state-of-the- art and an order of magnitude higher annotation throughput.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.70512867 <a title="90-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Diversify_and_Combine%3A_Improving_Word_Alignment_for_Machine_Translation_on_Low-Resource_Languages.html">90 acl-2010-Diversify and Combine: Improving Word Alignment for Machine Translation on Low-Resource Languages</a></p>

<p>Author: Hiroyuki Shindo ; Akinori Fujino ; Masaaki Nagata</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel framework for word alignment that incorporates synonym knowledge collected from monolingual linguistic resources in a bilingual probabilistic model. Synonym information is helpful for word alignment because we can expect a synonym to correspond to the same word in a different language. We design a generative model for word alignment that uses synonym information as a regularization term. The experimental results show that our proposed method significantly improves word alignment quality.</p><p>4 0.66338259 <a title="90-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-An_Exact_A%2A_Method_for_Deciphering_Letter-Substitution_Ciphers.html">29 acl-2010-An Exact A* Method for Deciphering Letter-Substitution Ciphers</a></p>
<p>Author: Eric Corlett ; Gerald Penn</p><p>Abstract: Letter-substitution ciphers encode a document from a known or hypothesized language into an unknown writing system or an unknown encoding of a known writing system. It is a problem that can occur in a number of practical applications, such as in the problem of determining the encodings of electronic documents in which the language is known, but the encoding standard is not. It has also been used in relation to OCR applications. In this paper, we introduce an exact method for deciphering messages using a generalization of the Viterbi algorithm. We test this model on a set of ciphers developed from various web sites, and find that our algorithm has the potential to be a viable, practical method for efficiently solving decipherment prob- lems.</p><p>5 0.58539796 <a title="90-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Learning_Lexicalized_Reordering_Models_from_Reordering_Graphs.html">163 acl-2010-Learning Lexicalized Reordering Models from Reordering Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Jinsong Su ; Yang Liu ; Yajuan Lv ; Haitao Mi ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: Lexicalized reordering models play a crucial role in phrase-based translation systems. They are usually learned from the word-aligned bilingual corpus by examining the reordering relations of adjacent phrases. Instead of just checking whether there is one phrase adjacent to a given phrase, we argue that it is important to take the number of adjacent phrases into account for better estimations of reordering models. We propose to use a structure named reordering graph, which represents all phrase segmentations of a sentence pair, to learn lexicalized reordering models efficiently. Experimental results on the NIST Chinese-English test sets show that our approach significantly outperforms the baseline method. 1</p><p>6 0.57300758 <a title="90-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Hierarchical_Search_for_Word_Alignment.html">133 acl-2010-Hierarchical Search for Word Alignment</a></p>

<p>Author: Kornel Laskowski</p><p>Abstract: Substantial research effort has been invested in recent decades into the computational study and automatic processing of multi-party conversation. While most aspects of conversational speech have benefited from a wide availability of analytic, computationally tractable techniques, only qualitative assessments are available for characterizing multi-party turn-taking. The current paper attempts to address this deficiency by first proposing a framework for computing turn-taking model perplexity, and then by evaluating several multi-participant modeling approaches. Experiments show that direct multi-participant models do not generalize to held out data, and likely never will, for practical reasons. In contrast, the Extended-Degree-of-Overlap model represents a suitable candidate for future work in this area, and is shown to successfully predict the distribution of speech in time and across participants in previously unseen conversations.</p><p>3 0.17123686 <a title="151-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Domain_Adaptation_of_Maximum_Entropy_Language_Models.html">91 acl-2010-Domain Adaptation of Maximum Entropy Language Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Joern Wuebker ; Arne Mauser ; Hermann Ney</p><p>Abstract: Several attempts have been made to learn phrase translation probabilities for phrasebased statistical machine translation that go beyond pure counting of phrases in word-aligned training data. Most approaches report problems with overfitting. We describe a novel leavingone-out approach to prevent over-fitting that allows us to train phrase models that show improved translation performance on the WMT08 Europarl German-English task. In contrast to most previous work where phrase models were trained separately from other models used in translation, we include all components such as single word lexica and reordering mod- els in training. Using this consistent training of phrase models we are able to achieve improvements of up to 1.4 points in BLEU. As a side effect, the phrase table size is reduced by more than 80%.</p><p>5 0.10314137 <a title="151-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Cross-Language_Document_Summarization_Based_on_Machine_Translation_Quality_Prediction.html">77 acl-2010-Cross-Language Document Summarization Based on Machine Translation Quality Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaojun Wan ; Huiying Li ; Jianguo Xiao</p><p>Abstract: Cross-language document summarization is a task of producing a summary in one language for a document set in a different language. Existing methods simply use machine translation for document translation or summary translation. However, current machine translation services are far from satisfactory, which results in that the quality of the cross-language summary is usually very poor, both in readability and content. In this paper, we propose to consider the translation quality of each sentence in the English-to-Chinese cross-language summarization process. First, the translation quality of each English sentence in the document set is predicted with the SVM regression method, and then the quality score of each sentence is incorporated into the summarization process. Finally, the English sentences with high translation quality and high informativeness are selected and translated to form the Chinese summary. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed approach. 1</p><p>6 0.097215086 <a title="151-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Unsupervised_Search_for_the_Optimal_Segmentation_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">249 acl-2010-Unsupervised Search for the Optimal Segmentation for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

We have employed an HMM statistical framework for both speech recognition and synthesis which provides transformation mechanisms to adapt the synthesized voice in TTS (text-to-speech) using the recognized voice in ASR (automatic speech recognition). An important application for this research is personalised speech-to-speech translation that will use the voice of the speaker in the input language to utter the translated sentences in the output language. In mobile environments this enhances the users’ interaction across language barriers by making the output speech sound more like the original speaker’s way of speaking, even if she or he could not speak the output language.</p><p>5 0.55195445 <a title="151-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-How_Spoken_Language_Corpora_Can_Refine_Current_Speech_Motor_Training_Methodologies.html">137 acl-2010-How Spoken Language Corpora Can Refine Current Speech Motor Training Methodologies</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniil Umanski ; Federico Sangati</p><p>Abstract: The growing availability of spoken language corpora presents new opportunities for enriching the methodologies of speech and language therapy. In this paper, we present a novel approach for constructing speech motor exercises, based on linguistic knowledge extracted from spoken language corpora. In our study with the Dutch Spoken Corpus, syllabic inventories were obtained by means of automatic syllabification of the spoken language data. Our experimental syllabification method exhibited a reliable performance, and allowed for the acquisition of syllabic tokens from the corpus. Consequently, the syl- labic tokens were integrated in a tool for clinicians, a result which holds the potential of contributing to the current state of speech motor training methodologies.</p><p>6 0.5503 <a title="151-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Online_Generation_of_Locality_Sensitive_Hash_Signatures.html">183 acl-2010-Online Generation of Locality Sensitive Hash Signatures</a></p>

<p>Author: Vipul Mittal</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method for automatic segmentation of a Sanskrit string into different words. The input for our segmentizer is a Sanskrit string either encoded as a Unicode string or as a Roman transliterated string and the output is a set of possible splits with weights associated with each of them. We followed two different approaches to segment a Sanskrit text using sandhi1 rules extracted from a parallel corpus of manually sandhi split text. While the first approach augments the finite state transducer used to analyze Sanskrit morphology and traverse it to segment a word, the second approach generates all possible segmentations and validates each constituent using a morph an- alyzer.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.72000384 <a title="151-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Intelligent_Selection_of_Language_Model_Training_Data.html">151 acl-2010-Intelligent Selection of Language Model Training Data</a></p>

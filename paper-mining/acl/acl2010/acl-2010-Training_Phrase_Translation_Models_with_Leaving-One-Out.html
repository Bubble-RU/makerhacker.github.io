<p>Author: Vamshi Ambati ; Stephan Vogel ; Jaime Carbonell</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised word alignment aims to improve the accuracy of automatic word alignment by incorporating full or partial manual alignments. Motivated by standard active learning query sampling frameworks like uncertainty-, margin- and query-by-committee sampling we propose multiple query strategies for the alignment link selection task. Our experiments show that by active selection of uncertain and informative links, we reduce the overall manual effort involved in elicitation of alignment link data for training a semisupervised word aligner.</p><p>4 0.30454686 <a title="240-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Discriminative_Modeling_of_Extraction_Sets_for_Machine_Translation.html">87 acl-2010-Discriminative Modeling of Extraction Sets for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: John DeNero ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We present a discriminative model that directly predicts which set ofphrasal translation rules should be extracted from a sentence pair. Our model scores extraction sets: nested collections of all the overlapping phrase pairs consistent with an underlying word alignment. Extraction set models provide two principle advantages over word-factored alignment models. First, we can incorporate features on phrase pairs, in addition to word links. Second, we can optimize for an extraction-based loss function that relates directly to the end task of generating translations. Our model gives improvements in alignment quality relative to state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised baselines, as well as providing up to a 1.4 improvement in BLEU score in Chinese-to-English translation experiments.</p><p>5 0.28269172 <a title="240-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Diversify_and_Combine%3A_Improving_Word_Alignment_for_Machine_Translation_on_Low-Resource_Languages.html">90 acl-2010-Diversify and Combine: Improving Word Alignment for Machine Translation on Low-Resource Languages</a></p>
<p>Author: Bing Xiang ; Yonggang Deng ; Bowen Zhou</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method to improve word alignment quality and eventually the translation performance by producing and combining complementary word alignments for low-resource languages. Instead of focusing on the improvement of a single set of word alignments, we generate multiple sets of diversified alignments based on different motivations, such as linguistic knowledge, morphology and heuristics. We demonstrate this approach on an English-to-Pashto translation task by combining the alignments obtained from syntactic reordering, stemming, and partial words. The combined alignment outperforms the baseline alignment, with significantly higher F-scores and better transla- tion performance.</p><p>6 0.26901507 <a title="240-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Improving_Statistical_Machine_Translation_with_Monolingual_Collocation.html">147 acl-2010-Improving Statistical Machine Translation with Monolingual Collocation</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiangyu Duan ; Min Zhang ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: The pipeline of most Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation (PB-SMT) systems starts from automatically word aligned parallel corpus. But word appears to be too fine-grained in some cases such as non-compositional phrasal equivalences, where no clear word alignments exist. Using words as inputs to PBSMT pipeline has inborn deficiency. This paper proposes pseudo-word as a new start point for PB-SMT pipeline. Pseudo-word is a kind of basic multi-word expression that characterizes minimal sequence of consecutive words in sense of translation. By casting pseudo-word searching problem into a parsing framework, we search for pseudo-words in a monolingual way and a bilingual synchronous way. Experiments show that pseudo-word significantly outperforms word for PB-SMT model in both travel translation domain and news translation domain. 1</p><p>4 0.74445277 <a title="240-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Discriminative_Pruning_for_Discriminative_ITG_Alignment.html">88 acl-2010-Discriminative Pruning for Discriminative ITG Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Shujie Liu ; Chi-Ho Li ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: While Inversion Transduction Grammar (ITG) has regained more and more attention in recent years, it still suffers from the major obstacle of speed. We propose a discriminative ITG pruning framework using Minimum Error Rate Training and various features from previous work on ITG alignment. Experiment results show that it is superior to all existing heuristics in ITG pruning. On top of the pruning framework, we also propose a discriminative ITG alignment model using hierarchical phrase pairs, which improves both F-score and Bleu score over the baseline alignment system of GIZA++. 1</p><p>5 0.72306347 <a title="240-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Diversify_and_Combine%3A_Improving_Word_Alignment_for_Machine_Translation_on_Low-Resource_Languages.html">90 acl-2010-Diversify and Combine: Improving Word Alignment for Machine Translation on Low-Resource Languages</a></p>

<p>Author: Haitao Mi ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: Tree-to-string systems (and their forestbased extensions) have gained steady popularity thanks to their simplicity and efficiency, but there is a major limitation: they are unable to guarantee the grammaticality of the output, which is explicitly modeled in string-to-tree systems via targetside syntax. We thus propose to combine the advantages of both, and present a novel constituency-to-dependency translation model, which uses constituency forests on the source side to direct the translation, and dependency trees on the target side (as a language model) to ensure grammaticality. Medium-scale experiments show an absolute and statistically significant improvement of +0.7 BLEU points over a state-of-the-art forest-based tree-to-string system even with fewer rules. This is also the first time that a treeto-tree model can surpass tree-to-string counterparts.</p><p>4 0.90537292 <a title="240-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Bayesian_Synchronous_Tree-Substitution_Grammar_Induction_and_Its_Application_to_Sentence_Compression.html">46 acl-2010-Bayesian Synchronous Tree-Substitution Grammar Induction and Its Application to Sentence Compression</a></p>
<p>Author: Elif Yamangil ; Stuart M. Shieber</p><p>Abstract: We describe our experiments with training algorithms for tree-to-tree synchronous tree-substitution grammar (STSG) for monolingual translation tasks such as sentence compression and paraphrasing. These translation tasks are characterized by the relative ability to commit to parallel parse trees and availability of word alignments, yet the unavailability of large-scale data, calling for a Bayesian tree-to-tree formalism. We formalize nonparametric Bayesian STSG with epsilon alignment in full generality, and provide a Gibbs sampling algorithm for posterior inference tailored to the task of extractive sentence compression. We achieve improvements against a number of baselines, including expectation maximization and variational Bayes training, illustrating the merits of nonparametric inference over the space of grammars as opposed to sparse parametric inference with a fixed grammar.</p><p>5 0.89843953 <a title="240-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Open_Information_Extraction_Using_Wikipedia.html">185 acl-2010-Open Information Extraction Using Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>Author: Fei Wu ; Daniel S. Weld</p><p>Abstract: Information-extraction (IE) systems seek to distill semantic relations from naturallanguage text, but most systems use supervised learning of relation-specific examples and are thus limited by the availability of training data. Open IE systems such as TextRunner, on the other hand, aim to handle the unbounded number of relations found on the Web. But how well can these open systems perform? This paper presents WOE, an open IE system which improves dramatically on TextRunner’s precision and recall. The key to WOE’s performance is a novel form of self-supervised learning for open extractors using heuris— tic matches between Wikipedia infobox attribute values and corresponding sentences to construct training data. Like TextRunner, WOE’s extractor eschews lexicalized features and handles an unbounded set of semantic relations. WOE can operate in two modes: when restricted to POS tag features, it runs as quickly as TextRunner, but when set to use dependency-parse features its precision and recall rise even higher.</p><p>6 0.89825916 <a title="240-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Discriminative_Pruning_for_Discriminative_ITG_Alignment.html">88 acl-2010-Discriminative Pruning for Discriminative ITG Alignment</a></p>

</p><p>3 With this object, we give two contrasting examples of descriptions of two Aboriginal languages finite verb forms morphology: Argentinean Quechua (quichua santiague n˜o) and Toba. [sent-5, score-0.506]
</p><p>4 The description of the morphology of the finite verb forms of Argentinean quechua, uses finite automata and finite transducers. [sent-6, score-0.964]
</p><p>5 In this case the construction is straightforward using two level morphology and then, describes in a very natural way the Argentinean Quechua morphology using a regular language. [sent-7, score-0.781]
</p><p>6 On the contrary, the  Toba verbs morphology, with a system that simultaneously uses prefixes and suffixes, has not a natural description as regular language. [sent-8, score-0.381]
</p><p>7 Toba has a complex system of causative suffixes, whose successive applications determinate the use of prefixes belonging different person marking prefix sets. [sent-9, score-0.52]
</p><p>8 (1995) to naturally deal with this and other similar morphological processes which involve interactions between prefixes and suffixes and then we describe the toba morphology using linear context-free languages. [sent-11, score-1.277]
</p><p>9 However, these works make no considerations about what class of formal languages is the natural for describing the morphology of one particular language. [sent-14, score-0.47]
</p><p>10 On the other hand, the criteria of classification of Amerindian languages, do not involve complexity criteria. [sent-15, score-0.038]
</p><p>11 In order to establish criteria that take into account the complexity of the description we present two contrasting examples in two Argentinean native languages: toba and quichua santiague n˜o. [sent-16, score-1.142]
</p><p>12 While the quichua has a natural representation in terms of a regular language using two level morphology, we will show that the Toba morphology has a more natural representation in terms of linear context-free languages. [sent-17, score-0.862]
</p><p>13 2  Quichua Santiague n˜o  The quichua santiague n˜o is a language of the Quechua language family. [sent-18, score-0.614]
</p><p>14 Typologically is an agglutinative language and its structure is almost exclusively based on the use of suffixes and is  extremely regular. [sent-20, score-0.175]
</p><p>15 The morphology takes a dominant part in this language with a rich set of validation suffixes. [sent-21, score-0.33]
</p><p>16 The quichua santiague n˜o has a much simpler phonologic system that other languages of this family: for example it has no series of aspirated or glottalized stops. [sent-22, score-0.729]
</p><p>17 Since the description of the verbal morphology is rich enough for our aim to expose the regular nature of quichua santiague n˜o morphology, we have restricted our study to the morphology of finite verbs forms. [sent-23, score-1.683]
</p><p>18 We use the two level morphology paradigm to express with finite regular transducers the rules that clearly illustrate how naturally this language phonology is regular. [sent-24, score-0.693]
</p><p>19 1  Phonological two level rules for the quichua santiague n˜o In this section we present the alphabet of the quichua santiague n˜o with which we have imple-  mented the quichua phonological rules in the paradigm of two level morphology. [sent-29, score-1.809]
</p><p>20 Valt (high vowel),VMed (median vowel), Vbaj (bass vowel) , Ftr (trasparent to medialization phonema), Cpos (posterior consonant). [sent-31, score-0.056]
</p><p>21 2 Quichua Santigue n˜o morphology The grammar that models the agglutination order is showed with a non deterministic finite automata. [sent-33, score-0.637]
</p><p>22 This description of the morphophonology was implemented using PC-KIMMO (Antworth, 1990) 3  The Toba morphology  With the aim of showing the simplicity of the phonologic rules we transcribe the two-level rules we have implemeted with the transducers in the thesis. [sent-35, score-0.577]
</p><p>23 R1-R4 model the medialization vowels procesess, R5-R7 are elision and ephentesis procesess with very specific contexts and R7 represents a diachornic phonological process with a subjacent form present in others quechua dialects. [sent-36, score-0.337]

[sent-37, score-0.035]
</p><p>25 sanat(a) -d -em -a 1Act- advice 2 dat ben 2 ” I advice you ” One of the characteristics of the toba verb morphology is a system of markation active-inactive on the verbal prefixes (Messineo, 2003; Klein, 1978). [sent-38, score-1.113]
</p><p>26 There are in this language two sets or verbal prefixes that mark action: 1. [sent-39, score-0.242]
</p><p>27 Class I(In):codifies inactive participants, objects of transitive verbs and pacients of intransitive verbs. [sent-40, score-0.139]
</p><p>28 Class II(Act): codifies active participants, subjects of transitive and intransitive verbs. [sent-43, score-0.218]
</p><p>29 2abrev: Act:active, ben:benefactive, dat:dative,inst: intrumental,Med: Median voice, pos: Posessor, refl: reflexive 110 g:AenG  fisexsfuxifueSs  s a aP  no  opTq81  . [sent-44, score-0.076]
</p><p>30 itdnoC i: pefuSnosxre  Cq0  111  Active affected(Medium voice, Med): codifies the presence of an active participant affected by the action that the verb codifies. [sent-46, score-0.194]
</p><p>31 The toba has a great quantity of morphological processes that involve interactions between suffixes and prefixes. [sent-48, score-0.704]
</p><p>32 In the next example the suffixation of the reflexive (−l? [sent-49, score-0.076]
</p><p>33 at) forces the use of the aactitoivne o person wfleixthiv prefixes of the voice medium class because the agent is affected by the action. [sent-50, score-0.509]
</p><p>34 (a) yalawat 3Activa -kill ” He kills” (b) nalawat -l’at 3Medkill -refl ” He kills himself” The agglutination of this suffix occurs in the last suffix box (after locatives, directional and  other derivational suffixes). [sent-52, score-0.22]
</p><p>35 Then, if we model this process using finite automata we will add many items to the lexicon (Sproat, 1992). [sent-53, score-0.302]
</p><p>36 The derivation of names from verbs is very productive. [sent-54, score-0.045]
</p><p>37 The resulting names use obligatory possessing person nominal prefixes. [sent-56, score-0.113]
</p><p>38 ledaGan -at 3pos write instr ”his pencil” The toba language also presents a complex system of causative suffixes that act as switching the transitivity of the verb. [sent-58, score-0.884]
</p><p>39 Transitivity is specially appreciable in the switching of the 3rd person prefix mark. [sent-59, score-0.19]
</p><p>40 2 we will use this process to show how linear context free grammars are a better than regular grammars for modeling agglutination in this language, but first we will present the former class of languages and its acceptor automata. [sent-61, score-0.468]
</p><p>41 1 Linear context free languages and two-taped nondeterministic finite-state automata  A linear context-free language is a language generated by a grammar context-free grammars G in which every production has one of the three forms (Creider et al. [sent-63, score-0.445]
</p><p>42 A → aB, with B a non terminal symbol and a a →ter amBin,a wl symbol. [sent-66, score-0.141]
</p><p>43 A → Ba, with B a non terminal symbol and a a →ter Bmain,a wl symbol. [sent-68, score-0.141]
</p><p>44 Linear context-free grammars have been studied by Rosenberg (1967) who showed that there is an equivalence between them and two-taped nondeterministic finite-state automata. [sent-69, score-0.136]
</p><p>45 Informally, a two-head nondeterministic finite-state automata could be thought as a generalization of a usual nondeterministic finite-state automata which has two read heads that independently reads in two different tapes, and at each transition only one tape moves. [sent-70, score-0.559]
</p><p>46 When both tapes have been processed, if the automata is at a final state, the parsing is successful. [sent-71, score-0.232]
</p><p>47 In the ambit that we are studying we can think that if a word is a string of prefixes, a stem  and suffixes, one automata head will read will the prefixes and the other the suffixes. [sent-72, score-0.346]
</p><p>48 Taking into account that linear grammars are in Rosenberg’s terms: ” The lowest class of nonregular contextfree grammars”, Creider et al. [sent-73, score-0.13]
</p><p>49 (1995) have taken this formal language class as the optimal to model morphological processes that involve interaction between prefixes and suffixes. [sent-74, score-0.389]
</p><p>50 2  Analysis of the third person verbal paradigm In this section we model the morphology of the third person of transitive verbs using two-taped finite nondeterministics automata. [sent-76, score-0.885]
</p><p>51 The modeling of this person is enough to show this description advantages with respect to others in terms of regular languages. [sent-77, score-0.279]
</p><p>52 The transitivity ofthe verb plays an important role in the selection of the person marker Class. [sent-78, score-0.212]
</p><p>53 i-/y- for transitive verbs y and some intrasitive subjects (Pr AcT). [sent-80, score-0.101]
</p><p>54 The successive application of the causative seems to act here, as was interpreted by Buckwalter (2001), like making the switch in the original verb transitivity as is shown en Example 4 in the next page. [sent-85, score-0.346]

</p><p>56 The resulting grammar, althought capable of modeling the morphology of the toba, would not work effectively. [sent-89, score-0.33]
</p><p>57 The effectiveness of a grammar is a measure of their productivity (Heintz, 1991). [sent-90, score-0.066]
</p><p>58 Taking into account the productivity of causative and reflexive verbal derivation we will prefer a description in terms of a context-free linear grammar with high effectivity than another using regular languages with low effectivity. [sent-91, score-0.654]
</p><p>59 To model the behavior of causative agglutina-  tion and the interaction with person prefixes using the two-head automata, we define two paths determined by the parity of the causative suffixes wich have been agglutinated to the verb. [sent-92, score-0.848]
</p><p>60 We have also to take into consideration the optative posterior aglutination of reflexive and reciprocal suffixes wich forces the use of medium voice person prefix. [sent-93, score-0.575]
</p><p>61 From the third person is also formed the third person indefinite actor from a prefix, qa -, which is at left and adjacent to the usual mark of the third person and after the mark of negation sa. [sent-94, score-0.366]
</p><p>62 Therefore, their agglutination is reserved to the last transitions. [sent-95, score-0.112]
</p><p>63 The resulting two-typed automata showed in Figure 2 also takes into account the relative order of the boxes and so the mutual restrictions between them (Klein, 1978). [sent-96, score-0.176]
</p><p>64 4  Future Research  It is interesting to note that phonological rules in toba can be naturally expressed by regular Finite Transducers. [sent-97, score-0.669]
</p><p>65 There are, however, many South American native languages that presents morphological processes analogous to the Toba and some  can present phonological processes that will have a more natural expression using Linear Finite Transducers. [sent-98, score-0.364]
</p><p>66 For example the Guarani language presents nasal harmony which expands from the root to both suffixes and prefixes (Krivoshein, 1994). [sent-99, score-0.345]
</p><p>67 This kind of characterization can have some value in language classification and the modeling of the great diversity of South American languages morphology can allow to obtain a formal concept of natural description of a language. [sent-100, score-0.479]

The description of the morphology of the finite verb forms of Argentinean quechua, uses finite automata and finite transducers.

<p>Author: Reyyan Yeniterzi ; Kemal Oflazer</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel scheme to apply factored phrase-based SMT to a language pair with very disparate morphological structures. Our approach relies on syntactic analysis on the source side (English) and then encodes a wide variety of local and non-local syntactic structures as complex structural tags which appear as additional factors in the training data. On the target side (Turkish), we only perform morphological analysis and disambiguation but treat the complete complex morphological tag as a factor, instead of separating morphemes. We incrementally explore capturing various syntactic substructures as complex tags on the English side, and evaluate how our translations improve in BLEU scores. Our maximal set of source and target side transformations, coupled with some additional techniques, provide an 39% relative improvement from a baseline 17.08 to 23.78 BLEU, all averaged over 10 training and test sets. Now that the syntactic analysis on the English side is available, we also experiment with more long distance constituent reordering to bring the English constituent order close to Turkish, but find that these transformations do not provide any additional consistent tangible gains when averaged over the 10 sets.</p><p>6 0.050694998 <a title="234-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Simultaneous_Tokenization_and_Part-Of-Speech_Tagging_for_Arabic_without_a_Morphological_Analyzer.html">213 acl-2010-Simultaneous Tokenization and Part-Of-Speech Tagging for Arabic without a Morphological Analyzer</a></p>

<p>Author: Andres Osvaldo Porta</p><p>Abstract: The aim of this work is to present some preliminary results of an investigation in course on the typology of the morphology of the native South American languages from the point of view of the formal language theory. With this object, we give two contrasting examples of descriptions of two Aboriginal languages finite verb forms morphology: Argentinean Quechua (quichua santiague n˜o) and Toba. The description of the morphology of the finite verb forms of Argentinean quechua, uses finite automata and finite transducers. In this case the construction is straightforward using two level morphology and then, describes in a very natural way the Argentinean Quechua morphology using a regular language. On the contrary, the Toba verbs morphology, with a system that simultaneously uses prefixes and suffixes, has not a natural description as regular language. Toba has a complex system of causative suffixes, whose successive applications determinate the use of prefixes belonging different person marking prefix sets. We adopt the solution of Creider et al. (1995) to naturally deal with this and other similar morphological processes which involve interactions between prefixes and suffixes and then we describe the toba morphology using linear context-free languages.1 .</p><p>2 0.65952271 <a title="234-lsi-2" href="./acl-2010-Automatic_Sanskrit_Segmentizer_Using_Finite_State_Transducers.html">40 acl-2010-Automatic Sanskrit Segmentizer Using Finite State Transducers</a></p>
<p>Author: Vipul Mittal</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method for automatic segmentation of a Sanskrit string into different words. The input for our segmentizer is a Sanskrit string either encoded as a Unicode string or as a Roman transliterated string and the output is a set of possible splits with weights associated with each of them. We followed two different approaches to segment a Sanskrit text using sandhi1 rules extracted from a parallel corpus of manually sandhi split text. While the first approach augments the finite state transducer used to analyze Sanskrit morphology and traverse it to segment a word, the second approach generates all possible segmentations and validates each constituent using a morph an- alyzer.</p><p>3 0.56325316 <a title="234-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-Enhanced_Word_Decomposition_by_Calibrating_the_Decision_Threshold_of_Probabilistic_Models_and_Using_a_Model_Ensemble.html">100 acl-2010-Enhanced Word Decomposition by Calibrating the Decision Threshold of Probabilistic Models and Using a Model Ensemble</a></p>
<p>Author: Sebastian Spiegler ; Peter A. Flach</p><p>Abstract: This paper demonstrates that the use of ensemble methods and carefully calibrating the decision threshold can significantly improve the performance of machine learning methods for morphological word decomposition. We employ two algorithms which come from a family of generative probabilistic models. The models consider segment boundaries as hidden variables and include probabilities for letter transitions within segments. The advantage of this model family is that it can learn from small datasets and easily gen- eralises to larger datasets. The first algorithm PROMODES, which participated in the Morpho Challenge 2009 (an international competition for unsupervised morphological analysis) employs a lower order model whereas the second algorithm PROMODES-H is a novel development of the first using a higher order model. We present the mathematical description for both algorithms, conduct experiments on the morphologically rich language Zulu and compare characteristics of both algorithms based on the experimental results.</p><p>4 0.5488292 <a title="234-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-String_Extension_Learning.html">217 acl-2010-String Extension Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jeffrey Heinz</p><p>Abstract: This paper provides a unified, learningtheoretic analysis of several learnable classes of languages discussed previously in the literature. The analysis shows that for these classes an incremental, globally consistent, locally conservative, set-driven learner always exists. Additionally, the analysis provides a recipe for constructing new learnable classes. Potential applications include learnable models for aspects of natural language and cognition.</p><p>5 0.49868798 <a title="234-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Estimating_Strictly_Piecewise_Distributions.html">103 acl-2010-Estimating Strictly Piecewise Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Jeffrey Heinz ; James Rogers</p><p>Abstract: Strictly Piecewise (SP) languages are a subclass of regular languages which encode certain kinds of long-distance dependencies that are found in natural languages. Like the classes in the Chomsky and Subregular hierarchies, there are many independently converging characterizations of the SP class (Rogers et al., to appear). Here we define SP distributions and show that they can be efficiently estimated from positive data.</p><p>6 0.46376157 <a title="234-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-A_Statistical_Model_for_Lost_Language_Decipherment.html">16 acl-2010-A Statistical Model for Lost Language Decipherment</a></p>

<p>Author: Weiwei Sun</p><p>Abstract: One deficiency of current shallow parsing based Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) methods is that syntactic chunks are too small to effectively group words. To partially resolve this problem, we propose semantics-driven shallow parsing, which takes into account both syntactic structures and predicate-argument structures. We also introduce several new “path” features to improve shallow parsing based SRL method. Experiments indicate that our new method obtains a significant improvement over the best reported Chinese SRL result.</p><p>4 0.46732169 <a title="234-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Evaluating_Multilanguage-Comparability_of_Subjectivity_Analysis_Systems.html">105 acl-2010-Evaluating Multilanguage-Comparability of Subjectivity Analysis Systems</a></p>

Along with its applications to various NLP tasks, much work have put efforts into multilingual subjectivity learning from existing resources. Multilingual subjectivity analysis requires language-independent criteria for comparable outcomes across languages. This paper proposes to measure the multilanguage-comparability of subjectivity analysis tools, and provides meaningful comparisons of multilingual subjectivity analysis from various points of view.</p><p>5 0.38083705 <a title="234-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Kernel_Based_Discourse_Relation_Recognition_with_Temporal_Ordering_Information.html">155 acl-2010-Kernel Based Discourse Relation Recognition with Temporal Ordering Information</a></p>
<p>Author: WenTing Wang ; Jian Su ; Chew Lim Tan</p><p>Abstract: Syntactic knowledge is important for discourse relation recognition. Yet only heuristically selected flat paths and 2-level production rules have been used to incorporate such information so far. In this paper we propose using tree kernel based approach to automatically mine the syntactic information from the parse trees for discourse analysis, applying kernel function to the tree structures directly. These structural syntactic features, together with other normal flat features are incorporated into our composite kernel to capture diverse knowledge for simultaneous discourse identification and classification for both explicit and implicit relations. The experiment shows tree kernel approach is able to give statistical significant improvements over flat syntactic path feature. We also illustrate that tree kernel approach covers more structure information than the production rules, which allows tree kernel to further incorporate information from a higher dimension space for possible better discrimination. Besides, we further propose to leverage on temporal ordering information to constrain the interpretation of discourse relation, which also demonstrate statistical significant improvements for discourse relation recognition on PDTB 2.0 for both explicit and implicit as well.

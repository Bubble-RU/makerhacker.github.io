<h1>203 acl-2010-Rebanking CCGbank for Improved NP Interpretation</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2010-203-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P10/P10-1022.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Matthew Honnibal ; James R. Curran ; Johan Bos</p><p>Abstract: Once released, treebanks tend to remain unchanged despite any shortcomings in their depth of linguistic analysis or coverage of specific phenomena. Instead, separate resources are created to address such problems. In this paper we show how to improve the quality of a treebank, by integrating resources and implementing improved analyses for specific constructions. We demonstrate this rebanking process by creating an updated version of CCGbank that includes the predicate-argument structure of both verbs and nouns, baseNP brackets, verb-particle constructions, and restrictive and non-restrictive nominal modifiers; and evaluate the impact of these changes on a statistical parser.</p><p>Reference: <a title="acl-2010-203-reference" href="../acl2010_reference/acl-2010-Rebanking_CCGbank_for_Improved_NP_Interpretation_reference.html">text</a></p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 The difficulty of the task means that we ought to view treebanking as an ongoing process akin to grammar development, such as the many years of work on the ERG (Flickinger, 2000).

</p><p>4 Our analysis allows the distinction between core and peripheral arguments to be represented for predicate nouns. [sent-26, score-0.497]
</p><p>5 Our analysis also recovers non-  local dependencies mediated by nominal predicates; for instance, Google is the agent of acquire in Google ’s decision to acquire YouTube. [sent-28, score-0.141]
</p><p>6 Together, these changes modify 30% of the labelled dependencies in CCGbank, demonstrating how multiple resources can be brought together in a single, richly annotated corpus. [sent-37, score-0.274]
</p><p>7 Statistical parsers induce their grammars from corpora, and the corpora for linguistically motivated formalisms currently do not contain high quality predicateargument annotation, because they were derived from the Penn Treebank (PTB Marcus et al. [sent-45, score-0.093]

</p><p>10 1 Combinatory Categorial Grammar Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG; Steedman, 2000) is a lexicalised grammar, which means that all grammatical dependencies are specified in the lexical entries and that the production of derivations is governed by a small set of rules. [sent-60, score-0.096]
</p><p>11 A category can have a functor as its result, so that a word can have a complex valency structure. [sent-63, score-0.095]
</p><p>12 For instance, a verb phrase is represented by the category S\NP: it is a function from a leftward cNaPte (a subject) :to i a sse an fteunncctei. [sent-64, score-0.095]

</p><p>16 208  3  Combining CCGbank corrections  There have been a few papers describing corrections to CCGbank. [sent-82, score-0.176]
</p><p>17 Vadas and Curran (2007) addressed this by manually annotating all of the ambiguous noun phrases in the PTB, and went on to use this information to correct 20,409 dependencies (1. [sent-92, score-0.218]
</p><p>18 2  Punctuation corrections  The syntactic analysis of punctuation is notoriously difficult, and punctuation is not always treated consistently in the Penn Treebank (Bies et al. [sent-96, score-0.21]
</p><p>19 This allows a grammar rule to be removed, preventing a great deal of spurious ambiguity and improving the speed of the C&C; parser (Clark and Curran, 2007) by 37%. [sent-100, score-0.146]
</p><p>20 3 Verb predicate-argument corrections Semantic role descriptions generally recognise a distinction between core arguments, whose role comes from a set specific to the predicate, and peripheral arguments, who have a role drawn from a small, generic set. [sent-102, score-0.452]
</p><p>21 This distinction is represented in the surface syntax in CCG, because the category of a verb must specify its argument structure. [sent-103, score-0.237]

</p><p>23 If a constituent such as as a director received an adjunct category, but was labelled as a core argument in Propbank, we changed it to a complement, using its head’s part-of-speech tag to infer its constituent type. [sent-107, score-0.377]
</p><p>24 We performed the equivalent transformation to ensure all peripheral arguments of verbs were analysed as adjuncts. [sent-108, score-0.426]
</p><p>25 4 Verb-particle constructions Propbank also offers reliable annotation of verbparticle constructions. [sent-110, score-0.138]

</p><p>27 4  Noun predicate-argument structure  Many common nouns in English can receive  optional complements and adjuncts, realised by prepositional phrases, genitive determiners, compound nouns, relative clauses, and for some nouns, complementised clauses. [sent-113, score-0.452]
</p><p>28 of peacep to Europeb  In (9), the genitive introduces the patient, but when the patient is supplied by the PP, it instead introduces the agent. [sent-119, score-0.246]
</p><p>29 The mapping differs for gift, where the genitive introduces the agent. [sent-120, score-0.147]
</p><p>30 The ambiguity can be seen in an NP such as The nobleman ’s portrait, where the genitive could mark possession (peripheral), or it could introduce the patient (core). [sent-122, score-0.193]
</p><p>31 The distinction between core and peripheral arguments is particularly difficult for compound nouns, as pre-modification is very productive in English. [sent-123, score-0.506]
</p><p>32 1 CCG analysis We designed our analysis for transparency between the syntax and the predicate-argument structure, by stipulating that all and only the core arguments should be syntactic arguments of the predicate’s category. [sent-125, score-0.329]
</p><p>33 This is fairly straightforward for arguments introduced by prepositions: destruction of Carthage  N/PPy PPy/NPy  NP  PPCarthage> Ndestruction> In our analysis, the head of of Carthage is Carthage, as of is assumed to be a semantically transparent case-marker. [sent-126, score-0.245]
</p><p>34 We apply this analysis to prepositional phrases that provide arguments to verbs as well a departure from CCGbank. [sent-127, score-0.24]
</p><p>35 Prepositional phrases that introduce peripheral arguments are analysed as syntactic adjuncts: The war in 149 B. [sent-128, score-0.463]
</p><p>36 —  NPy/Ny  N (Ny\Ny)/NPz  NP  \N>  (Ny\Ny)in  Nwar< NPwar> Adjunct prepositional phrases remain headed by the preposition, as it is the preposition’s semantics that determines whether they function as temporal, causal, spatial etc. [sent-130, score-0.169]
</p><p>37 Carthage  0s  destruction  NP (NPy/(Ny/PPz)y)\NPz N/PPy (NPy/(Ny/PPCarthage)y)0s< NPdestruction>  In this analysis, we regard the genitive clitic as a case-marker that performs a movement operation roughly analogous to WH-extraction. [sent-135, score-0.206]
</p><p>38 Its category is therefore similar to the one used in object extraction, (N\N)/(S/NP). [sent-136, score-0.095]
</p><p>39 This analysis allows recovery of verbal arguments of nominalised raising and control verbs, a construction which both Gildea and Hockenmaier (2003) and Boxwell and White (2008) identify as a problem case when aligning Propbank and CCGbank. [sent-138, score-0.132]
</p><p>40 The category assigned to decision can coindex the missing NP argument of buy with its own PP argument. [sent-140, score-0.24]
</p><p>41 When that argument is supplied by the genitive, it is also supplied to the verb, buy, filling its dependency with its agent, Google. [sent-141, score-0.198]
</p><p>42 This argument would be quite difficult to recover using a shallow syntactic analysis, as the path would be quite long. [sent-142, score-0.092]
</p><p>43 There are 494 such verb arguments mediated by nominal predicates in Sections 02-21. [sent-143, score-0.177]
</p><p>44 These analyses allow us to draw comple-  ment/adjunct distinctions for nominal predicates, so that the surface syntax takes us very close to a full predicate-argument analysis. [sent-144, score-0.19]
</p><p>45 The only local core arguments that we do not annotate as syntactic complements are compound nouns, such as decision makers. [sent-148, score-0.324]
</p><p>46 We avoided these arguments because of the productivity of nounnoun compounding in English, which makes these argument structures very difficult to recover. [sent-149, score-0.224]
</p><p>47 2  Implementation and statistics  Our analysis requires semantic role labels for each argument of the nominal predicates in the Penn Treebank precisely what NomBank (Meyers et al. [sent-153, score-0.137]
</p><p>48 We then assume that any prepositional phrase or genitive determiner annotated as a core argument in NomBank should be analysed as a complement, while peripheral arguments and adnominals that receive no semantic role label at all are analysed as adjuncts. [sent-158, score-1.027]
</p><p>49 We converted 34,345 adnominal prepositional phrases to complements, leaving 18,919 as adjuncts. [sent-159, score-0.147]
</p><p>50 The most common preposition converted was of, which was labelled as a core argument 99. [sent-160, score-0.245]
</p><p>51 The most common adjunct preposition was in, which realised a peripheral argument in —  59. [sent-162, score-0.436]
</p><p>52 73% of the occurrences of the 5 most frequent prepositions (of, in, for, on and to) realised peripheral arguments, compared with 53% for other prepositions. [sent-165, score-0.268]
</p><p>53 Core arguments were also more common than peripheral arguments for possessives. [sent-166, score-0.469]
</p><p>54 The percentage was similar for both personal pronouns (such as his) and genitive phrases (such as the boy’s). [sent-168, score-0.184]
</p><p>55 211  5  Adding restrictivity distinctions  Adnominals can have either a restrictive or a nonrestrictive (appositional) interpretation, determining the potential reference of the noun phrase it modifies. [sent-169, score-0.262]
</p><p>56 This ambiguity manifests itself in whether prepositional phrases, relative clauses and other adnominals are analysed as modifiers of either N or NP, yielding a restrictive or nonrestrictive interpretation respectively. [sent-170, score-0.41]
</p><p>57 In CCGbank, all adnominals attach to NPs, producing non-restrictive interpretations. [sent-171, score-0.137]
</p><p>58 We therefore move restrictive adnominals to N nodes: All NP/N  staff  on  N (N\N)/NP  casual contracts N/N N N> NPTC  N\N> N< NP> This corrects the previous interpretation, which stated that there were no permanent staff. [sent-172, score-0.201]

</p><p>63 There are similar constructions headed by common nouns, as in (19): (16) Some of us (17) Four of our members  (18) Those of us who smoke (19) A glass of wine We regard the common noun partitives as headed by the initial noun, such as glass, because this noun usually controls the number agreement. [sent-187, score-0.43]
</p><p>64 We therefore analyse these cases as nouns with prepositional arguments. [sent-188, score-0.115]
</p><p>65 In (19), glass would be assigned the category N/PP. [sent-189, score-0.146]

</p><p>74 The biggest changes were those described in Sections 4 and 5. [sent-215, score-0.09]
</p><p>75 After the addition of nominal predicate-argument structure, over 50% of the labelled dependencies were changed. [sent-216, score-0.229]
</p><p>76 Many of these changes involved changing an adjunct to a complement, which affects the unlabelled dependencies because the head and argument are inverted. [sent-217, score-0.457]

</p><p>84 9  Parsing Evaluation  Some of the changes we have made correct problems that have caused the performance of a statistical CCG parser to be over-estimated. [sent-238, score-0.148]
</p><p>85 Other changes introduce new distinctions, which a parser may or may not find difficult to reproduce. [sent-239, score-0.148]
</p><p>86 To in-  vestigate these issues, we trained and evaluated the C&C; CCG parser on our rebanked corpora. [sent-240, score-0.214]

</p><p>88 The parser scored slightly lower as the NP brackets, Quotes, Propbank and Particles corrections were added. [sent-272, score-0.146]
</p><p>89 CCGbank contains some dependencies that are trivial to recover, because Hockenmaier and Steedman (2007) was forced to adopt a strictly right-branching analysis for NP brackets. [sent-274, score-0.096]
</p><p>90 There was a larger drop in accuracy on the fully rebanked corpus, which included our analyses of restrictivity, partitive constructions and noun predicate-argument structure. [sent-275, score-0.502]
</p><p>91 The labelled dependencies evaluation is particularly sensitive to this, as a single category change affects multiple dependencies. [sent-277, score-0.279]
</p><p>92 This can be seen in the smaller gap in category accuracy. [sent-278, score-0.095]
</p><p>93 We investigated whether the differences in performance were due to the different evaluation data by comparing the parsers’ performance against the original parser on the dependencies they agreed upon, to allow direct comparison. [sent-279, score-0.154]
</p><p>94 Table 4 compares the labelled and unlabelled recall of the rebanked parsers we trained against the CCGbank parser on these intersections. [sent-281, score-0.406]
</p><p>95 The parser’s performance remained fairly stable on the dependencies left unchanged. [sent-284, score-0.096]
</p><p>96 8% worse than the CCGbank parser on the intersection de-  pendencies, suggesting that the fine-grained distinctions we introduced did cause some sparse data problems. [sent-286, score-0.132]
</p><p>97 This is another example of a phenomenon that could be analysed much better in CCGbank using an existing resource, the BBN named entity corpus. [sent-300, score-0.089]
</p><p>98 The process we have demonstrated can be used to train a parser that returns dependencies that abstract away as much surface syntactic variation as possible including, now, even whether the predicate and arguments are expressed in a noun phrase or a full clause. [sent-303, score-0.416]
</p><p>99 The parsing evaluation for this paper would have been much more difficult without the assistance of Stephen Boxwell, who helped generate the gold-standard dependencies with his software. [sent-309, score-0.096]

<p>Author: Matthew Honnibal ; James R. Curran ; Johan Bos</p><p>Abstract: Once released, treebanks tend to remain unchanged despite any shortcomings in their depth of linguistic analysis or coverage of specific phenomena. Instead, separate resources are created to address such problems. In this paper we show how to improve the quality of a treebank, by integrating resources and implementing improved analyses for specific constructions. We demonstrate this rebanking process by creating an updated version of CCGbank that includes the predicate-argument structure of both verbs and nouns, baseNP brackets, verb-particle constructions, and restrictive and non-restrictive nominal modifiers; and evaluate the impact of these changes on a statistical parser.</p><p>2 0.37350318 <a title="203-tfidf-2" href="./acl-2010-Accurate_Context-Free_Parsing_with_Combinatory_Categorial_Grammar.html">23 acl-2010-Accurate Context-Free Parsing with Combinatory Categorial Grammar</a></p>
<p>Author: Timothy A. D. Fowler ; Gerald Penn</p><p>Abstract: The definition of combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) in the literature varies quite a bit from author to author. However, the differences between the definitions are important in terms of the language classes of each CCG. We prove that a wide range of CCGs are strongly context-free, including the CCG of CCGbank and of the parser of Clark and Curran (2007). In light of these new results, we train the PCFG parser of Petrov and Klein (2007) on CCGbank and achieve state of the art results in supertagging accuracy, PARSEVAL measures and dependency accuracy.</p><p>3 0.23868561 <a title="203-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Minimized_Models_and_Grammar-Informed_Initialization_for_Supertagging_with_Highly_Ambiguous_Lexicons.html">172 acl-2010-Minimized Models and Grammar-Informed Initialization for Supertagging with Highly Ambiguous Lexicons</a></p>
<p>Author: Sujith Ravi ; Jason Baldridge ; Kevin Knight</p><p>Abstract: We combine two complementary ideas for learning supertaggers from highly ambiguous lexicons: grammar-informed tag transitions and models minimized via integer programming.

<p>Author: Jonathan K. Kummerfeld ; Jessika Roesner ; Tim Dawborn ; James Haggerty ; James R.

The idea is to train the supertagger on large amounts of parser output, so that the supertagger can learn to supply the supertags that the parser will eventually choose as part of the highestscoring derivation.

<p>Author: Haitao Mi ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: Tree-to-string systems (and their forestbased extensions) have gained steady popularity thanks to their simplicity and efficiency, but there is a major limitation: they are unable to guarantee the grammaticality of the output, which is explicitly modeled in string-to-tree systems via targetside syntax. We thus propose to combine the advantages of both, and present a novel constituency-to-dependency translation model, which uses constituency forests on the source side to direct the translation, and dependency trees on the target side (as a language model) to ensure grammaticality. Medium-scale experiments show an absolute and statistically significant improvement of +0.7 BLEU points over a state-of-the-art forest-based tree-to-string system even with fewer rules. This is also the first time that a treeto-tree model can surpass tree-to-string counterparts.</p><p>5 0.79421777 <a title="203-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Accurate_Context-Free_Parsing_with_Combinatory_Categorial_Grammar.html">23 acl-2010-Accurate Context-Free Parsing with Combinatory Categorial Grammar</a></p>

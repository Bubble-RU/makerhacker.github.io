</p><p>3 Three models related to Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a proven method for modelling document-word cooccurrences, are presented and evaluated on datasets of human plausibility judgements. [sent-3, score-0.559]
</p><p>4 Compared to previously proposed techniques, these models perform very competitively, especially for infrequent predicate-argument combinations where they exceed the quality of Web-scale predictions while using relatively little data. [sent-4, score-0.187]
</p><p>5 Recognising whether or not a selectional restriction is satisfied can be an important trigger for metaphorical interpretations (Wilks, 1978) and also plays a role in the time course of human sentence processing (Rayner et al. [sent-8, score-0.297]
</p><p>6 A more relaxed notion of selectional preference captures the idea that certain classes of entities are more likely than others to fill a given argument slot of a predicate. [sent-10, score-0.759]
</p><p>7 The notion of selectional preference is not restricted c am . [sent-13, score-0.46]
</p><p>8 The fundamental problem that selectional preference models must address is data sparsity: in many cases insufficient corpus data is available to reliably measure the plausibility of a predicate-argument pair by counting its observed frequency. [sent-17, score-0.826]
</p><p>9 A rarely seen pair may be fundamentally implausible (a carrot laughed) or plausible but rarely expressed (a manservant laughed). [sent-18, score-0.233]
</p><p>10 1 In general, it is beneficial to smooth plausibility estimates by integrating knowledge about the frequency of other, similar predicate-argument pairs. [sent-19, score-0.352]
</p><p>11 This paper takes up tools (“topic models”) that have been proven successful in modelling document-word co-occurrences and adapts them to the task of selectional preference learning. [sent-21, score-0.596]
</p><p>12 Advantages of these models include a well-defined  generative model that handles sparse data well, the ability to jointly induce semantic classes and predicate-specific distributions over those classes, and the enhanced statistical strength achieved by sharing knowledge across predicates. [sent-22, score-0.357]
</p><p>13 Section 2 surveys prior work on selectional preference modelling and on semantic applications of topic models. [sent-23, score-0.767]
</p><p>14 1 Selectional preference learning The representation (and latterly, learning) of selectional preferences for verbs and other predicates has long been considered a fundamental problem in computational semantics (Resnik, 1993). [sent-32, score-0.641]
</p><p>15 Many approaches to the problem use lexical taxonomies such as WordNet to identify the semantic classes that typically fill a particular argument slot for a predicate (Resnik, 1993; Clark and Weir, 2002; Schulte im Walde et al. [sent-33, score-0.593]
</p><p>16 In this paper, however, we focus on methods that do not assume the availability of a comprehensive taxonomy but rather induce semantic classes automatically from a corpus of text. [sent-35, score-0.213]
</p><p>17 (1999) introduced a model of selectional preference induction that casts the prob-  lem in a probabilistic latent-variable framework. [sent-38, score-0.51]
</p><p>18 ’s model each observed predicateargument pair is probabilistically generated from a latent variable, which is itself generated from an underlying distribution on variables. [sent-40, score-0.215]
</p><p>19 The use of latent variables, which correspond to coherent clusters of predicate-argument interactions, allow probabilities to be assigned to predicate-argument pairs which have not previously been observed by the model. [sent-41, score-0.243]
</p><p>20 The discovery of these predicate-argument clusters and the estimation of distributions on latent and observed variables are performed simultaneously via an Expectation Maximisation procedure. [sent-42, score-0.194]
</p><p>21 ’s latent variable approach, most directly in the model described in Section 3. [sent-44, score-0.219]
</p><p>22 (2007) describe a corpusdriven smoothing model which is not probabilistic in nature but relies on similarity estimates from a “semantic space” model that identifies semantic similarity with closeness in a vector space of cooccurrences. [sent-47, score-0.231]
</p><p>23 (2008) suggest learning selectional preferences in a discriminative way,  by training a collection of SVM classifiers to recognise likely and unlikely arguments for predicates of interest. [sent-49, score-0.546]
</p><p>24 They demonstrate that noisy counts from a Web search engine can yield estimates of plausibility for predicate-argument pairs that are superior to models learned from a smaller parsed corpus. [sent-51, score-0.501]
</p><p>25 2  Topic modelling  The task of inducing coherent semantic clusters is  common to many research areas. [sent-55, score-0.307]
</p><p>26 Formally seen, these are hierarchical Bayesian models which induce a set of latent variables or topics that are shared across documents. [sent-60, score-0.281]
</p><p>27 The tools provided by this research are used in this paper as the building blocks of our selectional preference models. [sent-63, score-0.46]
</p><p>28 (2007) integrate a model of random walks on the WordNet graph into an LDA topic model to build an unsupervised word sense disambiguation system. [sent-69, score-0.215]
</p><p>29 (2007) demonstrate that topic models learned from document-word co-occurrences are good predictors of semantic association judgements by humans. [sent-75, score-0.309]
</p><p>30 (2010) have also investigated the use of topic models for selectional preference learning. [sent-77, score-0.632]
</p><p>31 Their goal is slightly different to ours in that they wish to model the probability of a binary predicate taking two specified arguments, i. [sent-78, score-0.288]
</p><p>32 , P(n1, n2 |v), whereas we model the joint and conditional probabilities so fw a predicate taking a single specified argument. [sent-80, score-0.288]
</p><p>33 The most likely explanation is that LinkLDA generates its two arguments independently, which may be suitable for distinct argument positions of a given predicate but is unsuitable when one of those “arguments” is in fact the predicate. [sent-83, score-0.482]
</p><p>34 The models developed in this paper, though intended for semantic modelling, also bear some similarity to the internals of generative syntax models such as the “infinite tree” (Finkel et al. [sent-84, score-0.207]
</p><p>35 1 Notation In the model descriptions below we assume a predicate vocabulary of V types, an argument vocabulary of N types and a relation vocabulary of R types. [sent-89, score-0.67]
</p><p>36 Each predicate type is associated with a singe relation; for example the predicate type eat:V:dobj (the direct object of the verb eat) is treated as distinct from eat:V:subj (the subject of the verb eat). [sent-90, score-0.476]
</p><p>37 Each model has at least one vocabulary of Z arbitrar-  ily labelled latent variables. [sent-92, score-0.232]
</p><p>38 fzn is the number of observations where the latent variable z has been associated with the argument type n, fzv is the number of observations where z has been associated with the predicate type v and fzr is the number of observations where z has been associated with the relation r. [sent-93, score-0.965]
</p><p>39 Finally, fz· is the total number of observations associated with z and f·v is the total number of observations containing the predicate v. [sent-94, score-0.434]
</p><p>40 The analogical move from modelling document-term cooccurrences to modelling predicate-argument cooccurrences is intuitive: we assume that each predicate is associated with a distribution over semantic classes (“topics”) and that these classes are shared across  predicates. [sent-98, score-0.967]
</p><p>41 The high-level “generative story” for the LDA selectional preference model is as follows: (1) For each predicate v, draw a multinomial distribution Θv over argument classes from a Dirichlet distribution with parameters α. [sent-99, score-1.364]
</p><p>42 (2) For each argument class z, draw a multinomial distribution over argument types from a Dirichlet with parameters β. [sent-100, score-0.744]
</p><p>43 The first term in (2) can be seen as a smoothed estimate of the probability that class z produces the argument n; the second is a smoothed estimate of the probability that predicate v takes an argument belonging to class z. [sent-102, score-0.867]
</p><p>44 One important point is that the smoothing effects of the Dirichlet priors on Θv and Φz are greatest for predicates and arguments that are rarely seen, reflecting an intuitive lack of certainty. [sent-103, score-0.234]
</p><p>45 This model estimates predicate-argument probabilities conditional on a given predicate v; it cannot by itself provide joint probabilities P(n, v|r), which are needed for our plausibility sev Pa(luna,tvio|nr. [sent-106, score-0.64]
</p><p>46 ) Given a dataset of predicate-argument combinations and values for the hyperparameters α and β, the probability model is determined by the class assignment counts fzn and fzv. [sent-107, score-0.378]
</p><p>47 ’s (1999) selectional preference model, a latent variable is responsible for generating both the predicate and argument types of an observation. [sent-124, score-1.042]
</p><p>48 The basic LDA model can be extended to capture this kind of predicate-argument interaction; the generative story for the resulting ROOTH-LDA model is as follows: (1) For each relation r, draw a multinomial distribution Θr over interaction classes from a Dirichlet distribution with parameters α. [sent-125, score-0.623]
</p><p>49 (2) For each class z, draw a multinomial Φz over argument types from a Dirichlet distribution with parameters and a multinomial Ψz over predicate types from a Dirichlet distribution with parameters γ. [sent-126, score-0.985]
</p><p>50 β  (3) To generate an observation for r, draw a class z from Θr, then draw an argument type n from Φz and a predicate type v from Ψz. [sent-127, score-0.731]
</p><p>51 Unlike LDA, ROOTH-LDA does model the joint probability P(n, v|r) of a predicate and argument co-occurring. [sent-129, score-0.463]
</p><p>52 nF,uvr|trh)er o fd aiff pererednicceaste are th aragtu imnfeonrtmation about predicate-argument co-occurrence is only shared within a given interaction class rather than across the whole dataset and that the distribution Φz is not specific to the predicate v but rather to the relation r. [sent-130, score-0.481]
</p><p>53 4 A “dual-topic” model In our third model, we attempt to combine the advantages of LDA and ROOTH-LDA by clustering arguments and predicates according to separate 2http: //mallet . [sent-133, score-0.192]
</p><p>54 Each observation is generated by two latent variables rather than one, which potentially allows the model to learn more flexible interactions between arguments and predicates. [sent-137, score-0.247]
</p><p>55 : (1) For each relation r, draw a multinomial distribution Ξr over predicate classes from a Dirichlet with parameters κ. [sent-138, score-0.687]
</p><p>56 (2) For each predicate class c, draw a multinomial over predicate types and a multinomial Θc over argument classes from Dirichlets with parameters γ and α respectively. [sent-139, score-1.23]
</p><p>57 Ψc  (3) For each argument class z, draw a multinomial distribution Φz over argument types from a Dirichlet with parameters β. [sent-140, score-0.744]
</p><p>58 (4) To generate an observation for r, draw a predicate class c from Ξr, a predicate type from Ψc, an argument class z from and an argument type from Φz. [sent-141, score-1.156]
</p><p>59 Other approaches are possible resampling argument and then predicate class assignments for each –  observation in turn, or sampling argument and predicate assignments together by blocked sampling though from our experiments it does not seem that the choice of scheme makes a significant difference. [sent-143, score-1.15]
</p><p>60 One popular method for evaluating selectional preference models is by testing the correlation between their predictions and human judgements of plausibility on a dataset ofpredicate-argument pairs. [sent-146, score-1.1]
</p><p>61 In Section 5, we use two plausibility datasets to evaluate our models and compare to other previously published results. [sent-148, score-0.423]
</p><p>62 During development we used the verb-noun plausibility dataset from Pad o´ et al. [sent-153, score-0.356]
</p><p>63 439  Table 1: Most probable words for sample semantic classes induced from verb-object observations  three runs. [sent-169, score-0.317]

</p><p>65 LDA clusters nouns only, while ROOTH-LDA and ROOTH-EM learn classes that generate both nouns and verbs and DUAL-LDA clusters nouns and verbs separately. [sent-175, score-0.338]

</p><p>67 , blocked sampling of argument and predicate classes), without overcoming this brittleness. [sent-182, score-0.49]
</p><p>68 Unsurprisingly, ROOTH-EM’s classes have a similar feel to ROOTH-LDA; our general impression is that some of ROOTH-EM’s classes look even more coherent than the LDAbased models, presumably because it does not use priors to smooth its per-class distributions. [sent-183, score-0.393]
</p><p>69 2  Comparison with Keller and Lapata (2003)  Keller and Lapata (2003) collected a dataset of human plausibility judgements for three classes of grammatical relation: verb-object, noun-noun modification and adjective-noun modification. [sent-185, score-0.561]
</p><p>70 The items in this dataset were not chosen to balance plausibility and implausibility (as in prior psycholinguistic experiments) but according to their corpus frequency, leading to a more realistic task. [sent-186, score-0.392]
</p><p>71 30 predicates were selected for each relation;  each predicate was matched with three arguments from different co-occurrence bands in the BNC, e. [sent-187, score-0.38]
</p><p>72 Each predicate was also matched with three random arguments 440  Table 2: Results (Pearson r and Spearman ρ correlations) on Keller and Lapata’s (2003) plausibility data  with which it does not co-occur in the BNC (e. [sent-190, score-0.616]
</p><p>73 Following Keller and Lapata, –  we report Pearson correlation coefficients between log-transformed predicted frequencies and the goldstandard plausibility scores (which are already logtransformed). [sent-197, score-0.36]
</p><p>74 We also report Spearman rank correlations except where we do not have the original predictions (the Web count models), for completeness and because the predictions of preference models are may not be log-normally distributed as corpus counts are. [sent-198, score-0.507]

</p><p>76 For frequent predicate-argument pairs (Seen datasets), Web counts are clearly better; however, the BNC counts are unambiguously superior to LDA and ROOTH-LDA (whose predictions are based entirely on the generative model even for observed items) for the Seen verb-object data only. [sent-210, score-0.329]
</p><p>77 As might be suspected from the mixing problems observed with DUAL-LDA, this model does not perform as well as LDA and ROOTH-LDA, though it does hold its own against the other selectional preference methods. [sent-211, score-0.51]
</p><p>78 We hypothesise that the main reason for the superior numerical performance of the LDA models over EM is the principled smoothing provided by the use of Dirichlet priors, which has a small but discriminative effect on model predictions. [sent-229, score-0.252]
</p><p>79 ’s model on unseen adjectivenoun combinations, and significantly worse than the same model on seen adjective-noun data. [sent-232, score-0.22]
</p><p>80 Latent variable models that use EM for inference can be very sensitive to the number of latent variables chosen. [sent-233, score-0.226]
</p><p>81 For example, the performance of ROOTH-EM worsens quickly if the number of clusters is overestimated; for the Keller and Lapata datasets, settings above 50 classes lead to clear overfitting and a precipitous drop in Pearson cor-  relation scores. [sent-234, score-0.235]
</p><p>82 (2009) demonstrate that LDA is relatively insensitive to the choice of topic vocabulary size Z when the α and β hyperparameters are optimised appropriately during estimation. [sent-236, score-0.202]
</p><p>83 ’s finding for document modelling transfers to selectional preference models; within the range Z = 50–200 performance remains at a roughly similar level. [sent-239, score-0.596]
</p><p>84 (2008)  propose a discriminative approach to preference learning. [sent-246, score-0.203]
</p><p>85 As part of their evaluation, they compare their approach to a number of others, including that of Erk (2007), on a plausibility dataset collected by Holmes et al. [sent-247, score-0.356]
</p><p>86 ’s model, trained on the 3GB AQUAINT corpus, is the only model reported to achieve perfect accuracy on distinguishing plausible from implausible arguments. [sent-253, score-0.188]

</p><p>92 One principled method for folding corpus counts into LDA-like models would be to use hierarchical priors, as in the n-gram topic model of Wallach (2006). [sent-263, score-0.313]
</p><p>93 ’s (2008) discriminative model this could be done in a number of ways, including using the induced classes of a topic model as features for a discriminative –  classifier or using the discriminative classifier to produce additional high-quality training data from noisy unparsed text.

We present LDA-SP, which utilizes LinkLDA (Erosheva et al., 2004) to model selectional preferences. By simultaneously inferring latent topics and topic distributions over relations, LDA-SP combines the benefits of previous approaches: like traditional classbased approaches, it produces humaninterpretable classes describing each relation’s preferences, but it is competitive with non-class-based methods in predictive power. We compare LDA-SP to several state-ofthe-art methods achieving an 85% increase in recall at 0.9 precision over mutual information (Erk, 2007).

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models are used as “topic models” to produce a lowdimensional representation of documents, while Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs) define distributions over trees. The paper begins by showing that LDA topic models can be viewed as a special kind of PCFG, so Bayesian inference for PCFGs can be used to infer Topic Models as well. Adaptor Grammars (AGs) are a hierarchical, non-parameteric Bayesian extension of PCFGs. Exploiting the close relationship between LDA and PCFGs just described, we propose two novel probabilistic models that combine insights from LDA and AG models. The first replaces the unigram component of LDA topic models with multi-word sequences or collocations generated by an AG. The second extension builds on the first one to learn aspects of the internal structure of proper names.</p><p>4 0.24325421 <a title="158-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Fully_Unsupervised_Core-Adjunct_Argument_Classification.html">120 acl-2010-Fully Unsupervised Core-Adjunct Argument Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Yotaro Watanabe ; Masayuki Asahara ; Yuji Matsumoto</p><p>Abstract: In predicate-argument structure analysis, it is important to capture non-local dependencies among arguments and interdependencies between the sense of a predicate and the semantic roles of its arguments. However, no existing approach explicitly handles both non-local dependencies and semantic dependencies between predicates and arguments. In this paper we propose a structured model that overcomes the limitation of existing approaches; the model captures both types of dependencies simultaneously by introducing four types of factors including a global factor type capturing non-local dependencies among arguments and a pairwise factor type capturing local dependencies between a predicate and an argument. In experiments the proposed model achieved competitive results compared to the stateof-the-art systems without applying any feature selection procedure.</p><p>6 0.2161238 <a title="158-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Improving_the_Use_of_Pseudo-Words_for_Evaluating_Selectional_Preferences.html">148 acl-2010-Improving the Use of Pseudo-Words for Evaluating Selectional Preferences</a></p>

<p>Author: Alan Ritter ; Mausam Mausam ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: The computation of selectional preferences, the admissible argument values for a relation, is a well-known NLP task with broad applicability. We present LDA-SP, which utilizes LinkLDA (Erosheva et al., 2004) to model selectional preferences. By simultaneously inferring latent topics and topic distributions over relations, LDA-SP combines the benefits of previous approaches: like traditional classbased approaches, it produces humaninterpretable classes describing each relation’s preferences, but it is competitive with non-class-based methods in predictive power. We compare LDA-SP to several state-ofthe-art methods achieving an 85% increase in recall at 0.9 precision over mutual information (Erk, 2007). We also evaluate LDA-SP’s effectiveness at filtering improper applications of inference rules, where we show substantial improvement over Pantel et al. ’s system (Pantel et al., 2007).</p><p>3 0.71916658 <a title="158-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-Improving_the_Use_of_Pseudo-Words_for_Evaluating_Selectional_Preferences.html">148 acl-2010-Improving the Use of Pseudo-Words for Evaluating Selectional Preferences</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathanael Chambers ; Dan Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: This paper improves the use of pseudowords as an evaluation framework for selectional preferences. While pseudowords originally evaluated word sense disambiguation, they are now commonly used to evaluate selectional preferences. A selectional preference model ranks a set of possible arguments for a verb by their semantic fit to the verb. Pseudo-words serve as a proxy evaluation for these decisions. The evaluation takes an argument of a verb like drive (e.g. car), pairs it with an alternative word (e.g. car/rock), and asks a model to identify the original. This paper studies two main aspects of pseudoword creation that affect performance results. (1) Pseudo-word evaluations often evaluate only a subset of the words. We show that selectional preferences should instead be evaluated on the data in its entirety. (2) Different approaches to selecting partner words can produce overly optimistic evaluations. We offer suggestions to address these factors and present a simple baseline that outperforms the state-ofthe-art by 13% absolute on a newspaper domain.</p><p>4 0.63277072 <a title="158-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Fully_Unsupervised_Core-Adjunct_Argument_Classification.html">120 acl-2010-Fully Unsupervised Core-Adjunct Argument Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Amit Dubey</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic models of sentence comprehension are increasingly relevant to questions concerning human language processing. However, such models are often limited to syntactic factors. This paper introduces a novel sentence processing model that consists of a parser augmented with a probabilistic logic-based model of coreference resolution, which allows us to simulate how context interacts with syntax in a reading task. Our simulations show that a Weakly Interactive cognitive architecture can explain data which had been provided as evidence for the Strongly Interactive hypothesis.</p><p>4 0.90401924 <a title="158-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Contextualizing_Semantic_Representations_Using_Syntactically_Enriched_Vector_Models.html">70 acl-2010-Contextualizing Semantic Representations Using Syntactically Enriched Vector Models</a></p>

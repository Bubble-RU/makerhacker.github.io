</p><p>3 We also introduce several new “path” features to improve shallow parsing based SRL method. [sent-4, score-0.427]
</p><p>4 1 Introduction In the last few years, there has been an increasing interest in Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) on  several languages, which consists of recognizing arguments involved by predicates of a given sentence and labeling their semantic types. [sent-6, score-0.233]
</p><p>5 Both full parsing based and shallow parsing based SRL methods have been discussed for English and Chinese. [sent-7, score-0.493]
</p><p>6 In Chinese SRL, shallow parsing based methods that cast SRL as the classification of syntactic chunks into semantic labels has gained promising results. [sent-8, score-0.939]
</p><p>7 , 2009) outperforms the best published performance of full parsing based SRL systems. [sent-10, score-0.137]
</p><p>8 Because of the semantic information it contains, we call it semantics-driven shallow parsing. [sent-13, score-0.37]
</p><p>9 The key idea is to make basic chunks as large as possible but not overlap with arguments. [sent-14, score-0.374]
</p><p>10 Additionally, we introduce several new “path” features to express more structural information, which is important for SRL. [sent-15, score-0.048]
</p><p>11 With semantics-driven shallow parsing, our SRL system achieves 76. [sent-17, score-0.265]
</p><p>12 2  Related Work  CPB is a project to add predicate-argument relations to the syntactic trees of the Chinese TreeBank (CTB). [sent-24, score-0.098]
</p><p>13 Similar to English PropBank, the arguments of a predicate are labeled with a contiguous sequence of integers, in the form of AN (N is a natural number); the adjuncts are annotated as such with the label AM followed by a secondary tag that represents the semantic classification of the adjunct. [sent-25, score-0.281]
</p><p>14 To partially resolve this problem, we propose a new shallow parsing. [sent-28, score-0.33]
</p><p>15 The new chunk definition takes into account both syntactic structure and predicate-argument structures  A0, meaning that it is the proto-Agent of “提供”. [sent-29, score-0.612]
</p><p>16 (2009) explore the Chinese SRL problem on the basis of shallow syntactic information at the level of phrase chunks. [sent-31, score-0.434]
</p><p>17 They present a semantic chunking method to resolve SRL on basis of shallow parsing. [sent-32, score-0.664]
</p><p>18 Their method casts SRL as the classification of syntactic chunks with IOB2 representation for semantic roles (i. [sent-33, score-0.56]

</p><p>20 Two labeling strategies are presented: 1) directly tagging semantic chunks in one-stage, and 2) identifying argument boundaries as a chunking task and labeling their semantic types as a classification task. [sent-40, score-1.026]
</p><p>21 On the basis of syntactic chunks, they define semantic chunks which do not overlap nor embed using IOB2 representation. [sent-41, score-0.613]
</p><p>22 Syntactic chunks outside a chunk receive the tag O (Outside). [sent-42, score-0.784]
</p><p>23 For syntactic chunks forming a chunk of type A *, the first chunk receives the B-A* tag (Begin), and the remaining ones receive the tag I-A * (Inside). [sent-43, score-1.335]
</p><p>24 The definition of syntactic and semantic chunks is illustrated Figure 1. [sent-47, score-0.595]
</p><p>25 For example, “保险公司/the insurance company”, consisting of two nouns, is a noun phrase; in the  syntactic chunking stage, its two components “保 险” and “公 司” should be labeled as B-NP and I-NP. [sent-48, score-0.355]
</p><p>26 Because this phrase is the Agent of the predicate “提 供/provide”, it takes a semantic chunk label B-A0. [sent-49, score-0.63]
</p><p>27 In the semantic chunking stage, this phrase should be labeled as B-A0. [sent-50, score-0.354]
</p><p>28 Their experiments on CPB indicate that according to current state-of-the-art of Chinese parsing, SRL systems on basis of full parsing do not perform better than systems based on shallow parsing. [sent-51, score-0.415]
</p><p>29 They report the best SRL performance with gold segmentation and POS tagging as inputs. [sent-52, score-0.046]
</p><p>30 In English SRL, previous work shows that full parsing, both constituency parsing and dependency parsing, is necessary. [sent-54, score-0.114]
</p><p>31 Ding and Chang (2009) discuss semantic chunking methods without any parsing information. [sent-55, score-0.433]
</p><p>32 , 2009), their method formulates SRL as the classification of words with semantic chunks. [sent-57, score-0.127]
</p><p>33 Comparison of experimental results in their work shows that parsing is necessary for Chinese SRL, and the semantic  chunking methods on the basis of shallow parsing outperform the ones without any parsing. [sent-58, score-0.848]
</p><p>34 Joint learning of syntactic and semantic structures is another hot topic in dependency parsing research. [sent-59, score-0.341]
</p><p>35 The CoNLL 2008/2009 shared tasks propose a unified dependency-based formalism to model both syntactic dependencies and semantic roles for multiple languages. [sent-63, score-0.241]
</p><p>36 Several joint parsing models are presented in the shared tasks. [sent-64, score-0.152]
</p><p>37 In this paper, we hope to find better syntactic representation for semantic role labeling. [sent-66, score-0.236]
</p><p>38 1 Motivation There are two main jobs of semantic chunking: 1) grouping words as argument candidate and 2) classifying semantic types of possible arguments. [sent-68, score-0.3]
</p><p>39 Previously proposed shallow parsing only considers syntactic information and basic chunks are usu-  ally too small to effectively group words. [sent-69, score-0.812]
</p><p>40 the argument “为 三 峡 程/for the Sanxia Project” consists of three chunks, each of which only consists of one word. [sent-73, score-0.063]
</p><p>41 To rightly recognize this A2, Semantic chunker should rightly predict three chunk labels. [sent-74, score-0.468]
</p><p>42 Small chunks also make the important “path” feature sparse, since there are more chunks between a target chunk and the predicate in focus. [sent-75, score-1.159]
</p><p>43 In this section, we introduce a new chunk definition to improve shallow parsing based SRL, which takes both syntactic and predicateargument structures into account. [sent-76, score-1.018]
</p><p>44 The key idea is to make syntactic chunks as large as possible for semantic chunking. [sent-77, score-0.538]
</p><p>45 , wn, let c[i : j] denote a constituent that is made up of words between wi and wj (including wi and wj); let pv = {c[i : j] |c[i : j] is an argument of v} 104  denote one predicate-argument structure where v is the predicate in focus. [sent-83, score-0.235]
</p><p>46 Given a syntactic tree Ts = {c[i : j] |c[i : j] is a constituent of s}, and Tits a=ll argument s[itru :c jtu]r iess Ps = {pv | v oisf a }ve,r abnadl predicate uinm s}, stthruercet irse one a=nd { only one cvherubnakl sperte dCi = {c[i : j] } hse. [sent-84, score-0.32]
</p><p>47 ∀c[i : j] ∈ C, ∀c[iv : jv] ∈ ∪Ps, j < iv or i∀ jv or ∈iv ≤ i∀ ≤ j ≤ jv;  >  3. [sent-88, score-0.106]
</p><p>48 The first condition guarantees that every chunk is a constituent. [sent-92, score-0.475]
</p><p>49 The second condition means that  chunks do not overlap with arguments, and further guarantees that semantic chunking can recover all arguments with the last condition. [sent-93, score-0.817]
</p><p>50 The third condition makes new chunks as big as possible. [sent-94, score-0.4]
</p><p>51 Figure t2a i ns an example ptoo nilelnust-s trate our new chunk definition. [sent-96, score-0.409]
</p><p>52 For example, “中 国/Chinese 税 务/tax 部 分/department” is a constituent of current sentence, and is also an argument of “规定/stipulate”. [sent-97, score-0.098]
</p><p>53 If we take it as a chunk, it does not conflict with any other arguments, so it is a reasonable syntactic chunk. [sent-98, score-0.098]
</p><p>54 For the phrase “欠缴/owing 税款/tax payment”, though it does not overlap with the first, third and fourth propositions, it is bigger than the argument “税款” (conflicting with condition 2) while labeling the predicate “欠缴”, so it has to be separated into two chunks. [sent-99, score-0.35]
</p><p>55 Note that the third condition also guarantees the constituents in C does not overlap with aeantcehe sot thheer soinnsceti ueaenchts one Cis d as large as possible. [sent-100, score-0.149]
</p><p>56 So we can still formulate our new shallow parsing as an “IOB” sequence labeling problem. [sent-101, score-0.491]
</p><p>57 The column CHUNK 1 illustrates this kind of chunk type definition. [sent-105, score-0.461]
</p><p>58 Inspired by (Klein and Manning, 2003), we split one phrase type into several subsymbols, which contain category information of current constituent’s parent. [sent-107, score-0.061]
</p><p>59 This strategy severely increases the number of chunk types and make it hard to train chunking models. [sent-109, score-0.602]
</p><p>60 At both ends, the chain is terminated with the POS  tags of the predicate and the headword of the token. [sent-117, score-0.078]
</p><p>61 For example, the path feature of “保 险 公 司” in Figure 1 is “公司-ADVP-PP-NP-NP-VV”. [sent-118, score-0.149]
</p><p>62 To better capture structural information, we introduce several new “path” features. [sent-120, score-0.048]
</p><p>63 They include: •  NP |PP|VP path: only syntactic chunks tNhaPt| taPk|VesP tag NP, PP or VP are kept. [sent-121, score-0.472]
</p><p>64 105  When labeling the predicate “出 境/leave the country” in Figure 2, this feature of “中 国 税 务 部 门/Chinese tax departments” is NP+NP+NP+NP+VP. [sent-122, score-0.215]
</p><p>65 O2POS path: if a word occupies a chunk  lOab2ePl O, use iitfs P wOoSr i onc tuhpei path fuenakture. [sent-124, score-0.514]
</p><p>66 The data is divided into three parts: files from chtb 081 to chtb 899 are used as training set; files from chtb 041 to chtb 080 as development set; files from chtb 001 to chtb 040, and chtb 900 to chtb 93 1 as test set. [sent-134, score-1.602]
</p><p>67 Both syntactic chunkers and semantic chunkers are trained and evaluated by us-  ing the same data set. [sent-135, score-0.297]
</p><p>68 By using CPB and CTB, we can extract gold standard semantics-driven shallow chunks according to our definition. [sent-136, score-0.623]
</p><p>69 We use this kind of gold chunks automatically generated from training data to train syntactic chunkers. [sent-137, score-0.48]
</p><p>70 For both syntactic and semantic chunking, we used conditional random field model. [sent-138, score-0.203]
</p><p>71 Crfsgd provides a feature template that defines a set of strong word and POS features to do syntactic chunking. [sent-140, score-0.121]
</p><p>72 We use this feature template to resolve shallow parsing. [sent-141, score-0.332]
</p><p>73 For semantic chunking, we implement a similar onestage shallow parsing based SRL system described in (Sun et al. [sent-142, score-0.484]
</p><p>74 First, our system uses Start/End method to represent semantic chunks (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001). [sent-146, score-0.44]
</p><p>75 2 Syntactic Chunking Performance Table 1 shows the performance of shallow syntactic parsing. [sent-166, score-0.386]
</p><p>76 , 2006 is the chunking performance evaluated on syntactic chunk definition proposed in (Chen et al. [sent-168, score-0.78]
</p><p>77 The second and third blocks present the chunking performance with new semantics-driven shallow parsing. [sent-170, score-0.55]
</p><p>78 The second block shows the overall performance when the first kind of chunks type is used, while the last block shows the performance when the more complex chunk type definition is used. [sent-171, score-0.968]
</p><p>79 For the semantic-driven parsing experiments, we add the path from current word to the first verb before or after as two new features. [sent-172, score-0.261]
</p><p>80 Because the two new chunk definitions use the same chunk boundaries, the fourth and sixth lines are comparable. [sent-175, score-0.797]
</p><p>81 There is a clear decrease between the traditional shallow parsing (Chen et al. [sent-176, score-0.379]
</p><p>82 We think one main reason is that syntactic chunks in our new definition are larger than the traditional ones. [sent-178, score-0.511]
</p><p>83 An interesting phenomenon is that though the second kind of chunk type definition increases the complexity of the parsing job, it achieves better bracketing performance. [sent-179, score-0.652]
</p><p>84 These two systems are both evaluated by using syntactic chunking defined in (Chen et al. [sent-188, score-0.312]
</p><p>85 From the first block we can see that our semantic chunking system  reaches the state-of-the-art. [sent-190, score-0.352]

</p><p>88 Line SRL (C1) and SRL (C2) show the overall performances with the first and second chunk definition. [sent-194, score-0.388]
</p><p>89 We can see that new “path” features are useful for semantic chunking. [sent-196, score-0.126]
</p><p>90 , 2006)], SRL [C1] and SRL [C2] respetively denote the SRL systems based on shallow parsing defined in (Chen et al. [sent-210, score-0.379]
</p><p>91 5  Conclusion  In this paper we propose a new syntactic shallow parsing for Chinese SRL. [sent-212, score-0.498]
</p><p>92 The new chunk definition contains both syntactic structure and predicate-argument structure information. [sent-213, score-0.564]
</p><p>93 To improve SRL, we also introduce several new “path” features. [sent-214, score-0.048]
</p><p>94 Experimental results show that our new chunk definition is more suitable for Chinese SRL. [sent-215, score-0.466]
</p><p>95 It is still an open question what kinds of syntactic information is most important for Chinese SRL. [sent-216, score-0.098]

<p>Author: Junhui Li ; Guodong Zhou ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: This paper explores joint syntactic and semantic parsing of Chinese to further improve the performance of both syntactic and semantic parsing, in particular the performance of semantic parsing (in this paper, semantic role labeling). This is done from two levels. Firstly, an integrated parsing approach is proposed to integrate semantic parsing into the syntactic parsing process. Secondly, semantic information generated by semantic parsing is incorporated into the syntactic parsing model to better capture semantic information in syntactic parsing. Evaluation on Chinese TreeBank, Chinese PropBank, and Chinese NomBank shows that our integrated parsing approach outperforms the pipeline parsing approach on n-best parse trees, a natural extension of the widely used pipeline parsing approach on the top-best parse tree. Moreover, it shows that incorporating semantic role-related information into the syntactic parsing model significantly improves the performance of both syntactic parsing and semantic parsing. To our best knowledge, this is the first research on exploring syntactic parsing and semantic role labeling for both verbal and nominal predicates in an integrated way. 1</p><p>3 0.43171999 <a title="207-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Improving_Chinese_Semantic_Role_Labeling_with_Rich_Syntactic_Features.html">146 acl-2010-Improving Chinese Semantic Role Labeling with Rich Syntactic Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Fei Huang ; Alexander Yates</p><p>Abstract: Most supervised language processing systems show a significant drop-off in performance when they are tested on text that comes from a domain significantly different from the domain of the training data. Semantic role labeling techniques are typically trained on newswire text, and in tests their performance on fiction is as much as 19% worse than their performance on newswire text. We investigate techniques for building open-domain semantic role labeling systems that approach the ideal of a train-once, use-anywhere system. We leverage recently-developed techniques for learning representations of text using latent-variable language models, and extend these techniques to ones that provide the kinds of features that are useful for semantic role labeling. In experiments, our novel system reduces error by 16% relative to the previous state of the art on out-of-domain text.</p><p>5 0.23056094 <a title="207-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Adapting_Self-Training_for_Semantic_Role_Labeling.html">25 acl-2010-Adapting Self-Training for Semantic Role Labeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Rasoul Samad Zadeh Kaljahi</p><p>Abstract: Supervised semantic role labeling (SRL) systems trained on hand-crafted annotated corpora have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, creating such corpora is tedious and costly, with the resulting corpora not sufficiently representative of the language. This paper describes a part of an ongoing work on applying bootstrapping methods to SRL to deal with this problem. Previous work shows that, due to the complexity of SRL, this task is not straight forward. One major difficulty is the propagation of classification noise into the successive iterations. We address this problem by employing balancing and preselection methods for self-training, as a bootstrapping algorithm. The proposed methods could achieve improvement over the base line, which do not use these methods. 1</p><p>6 0.22726676 <a title="207-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Starting_from_Scratch_in_Semantic_Role_Labeling.html">216 acl-2010-Starting from Scratch in Semantic Role Labeling</a></p>

<p>Author: Weiwei Sun</p><p>Abstract: Developing features has been shown crucial to advancing the state-of-the-art in Semantic Role Labeling (SRL). To improve Chinese SRL, we propose a set of additional features, some of which are designed to better capture structural information. Our system achieves 93.49 Fmeasure, a significant improvement over the best reported performance 92.0. We are further concerned with the effect of parsing in Chinese SRL. We empirically analyze the two-fold effect, grouping words into constituents and providing syntactic information. We also give some preliminary linguistic explanations.</p><p>3 0.85654342 <a title="207-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-Joint_Syntactic_and_Semantic_Parsing_of_Chinese.html">153 acl-2010-Joint Syntactic and Semantic Parsing of Chinese</a></p>
<p>Author: Junhui Li ; Guodong Zhou ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: This paper explores joint syntactic and semantic parsing of Chinese to further improve the performance of both syntactic and semantic parsing, in particular the performance of semantic parsing (in this paper, semantic role labeling). This is done from two levels. Firstly, an integrated parsing approach is proposed to integrate semantic parsing into the syntactic parsing process. Secondly, semantic information generated by semantic parsing is incorporated into the syntactic parsing model to better capture semantic information in syntactic parsing. Evaluation on Chinese TreeBank, Chinese PropBank, and Chinese NomBank shows that our integrated parsing approach outperforms the pipeline parsing approach on n-best parse trees, a natural extension of the widely used pipeline parsing approach on the top-best parse tree. Moreover, it shows that incorporating semantic role-related information into the syntactic parsing model significantly improves the performance of both syntactic parsing and semantic parsing. To our best knowledge, this is the first research on exploring syntactic parsing and semantic role labeling for both verbal and nominal predicates in an integrated way. 1</p><p>4 0.69849598 <a title="207-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Open-Domain_Semantic_Role_Labeling_by_Modeling_Word_Spans.html">184 acl-2010-Open-Domain Semantic Role Labeling by Modeling Word Spans</a></p>
<p>Author: Fei Huang ; Alexander Yates</p><p>Abstract: Most supervised language processing systems show a significant drop-off in performance when they are tested on text that comes from a domain significantly different from the domain of the training data. Semantic role labeling techniques are typically trained on newswire text, and in tests their performance on fiction is as much as 19% worse than their performance on newswire text. We investigate techniques for building open-domain semantic role labeling systems that approach the ideal of a train-once, use-anywhere system. We leverage recently-developed techniques for learning representations of text using latent-variable language models, and extend these techniques to ones that provide the kinds of features that are useful for semantic role labeling. In experiments, our novel system reduces error by 16% relative to the previous state of the art on out-of-domain text.</p><p>5 0.64855707 <a title="207-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Starting_from_Scratch_in_Semantic_Role_Labeling.html">216 acl-2010-Starting from Scratch in Semantic Role Labeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Connor ; Yael Gertner ; Cynthia Fisher ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: A fundamental step in sentence comprehension involves assigning semantic roles to sentence constituents. To accomplish this, the listener must parse the sentence, find constituents that are candidate arguments, and assign semantic roles to those constituents. Each step depends on prior lexical and syntactic knowledge. Where do children learning their first languages begin in solving this problem? In this paper we focus on the parsing and argumentidentification steps that precede Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) training. We combine a simplified SRL with an unsupervised HMM part of speech tagger, and experiment with psycholinguisticallymotivated ways to label clusters resulting from the HMM so that they can be used to parse input for the SRL system. The results show that proposed shallow representations of sentence structure are robust to reductions in parsing accuracy, and that the contribution of alternative representations of sentence structure to successful semantic role labeling varies with the integrity of the parsing and argumentidentification stages.</p><p>6 0.62105805 <a title="207-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Adapting_Self-Training_for_Semantic_Role_Labeling.html">25 acl-2010-Adapting Self-Training for Semantic Role Labeling</a></p>

<p>Author: Andres Osvaldo Porta</p><p>Abstract: The aim of this work is to present some preliminary results of an investigation in course on the typology of the morphology of the native South American languages from the point of view of the formal language theory. With this object, we give two contrasting examples of descriptions of two Aboriginal languages finite verb forms morphology: Argentinean Quechua (quichua santiague n˜o) and Toba. The description of the morphology of the finite verb forms of Argentinean quechua, uses finite automata and finite transducers. In this case the construction is straightforward using two level morphology and then, describes in a very natural way the Argentinean Quechua morphology using a regular language. On the contrary, the Toba verbs morphology, with a system that simultaneously uses prefixes and suffixes, has not a natural description as regular language. Toba has a complex system of causative suffixes, whose successive applications determinate the use of prefixes belonging different person marking prefix sets. We adopt the solution of Creider et al. (1995) to naturally deal with this and other similar morphological processes which involve interactions between prefixes and suffixes and then we describe the toba morphology using linear context-free languages.1 .</p><p>2 0.85595393 <a title="207-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Automatic_Selectional_Preference_Acquisition_for_Latin_Verbs.html">41 acl-2010-Automatic Selectional Preference Acquisition for Latin Verbs</a></p>

<p>Author: WenTing Wang ; Jian Su ; Chew Lim Tan</p><p>Abstract: Syntactic knowledge is important for discourse relation recognition. Yet only heuristically selected flat paths and 2-level production rules have been used to incorporate such information so far. In this paper we propose using tree kernel based approach to automatically mine the syntactic information from the parse trees for discourse analysis, applying kernel function to the tree structures directly. These structural syntactic features, together with other normal flat features are incorporated into our composite kernel to capture diverse knowledge for simultaneous discourse identification and classification for both explicit and implicit relations. The experiment shows tree kernel approach is able to give statistical significant improvements over flat syntactic path feature. We also illustrate that tree kernel approach covers more structure information than the production rules, which allows tree kernel to further incorporate information from a higher dimension space for possible better discrimination. Besides, we further propose to leverage on temporal ordering information to constrain the interpretation of discourse relation, which also demonstrate statistical significant improvements for discourse relation recognition on PDTB 2.0 for both explicit and implicit as well.

</p><p>5 1 Introduction In recent semantic role labeling (SRL) competitions such as the shared tasks of CoNLL 2005 and CoNLL 2008, supervised SRL systems have been trained on newswire text, and then tested on both an in-domain test set (Wall Street Journal text) and an out-of-domain test set (fiction). [sent-10, score-0.412]
</p><p>6 Yet the baseline from CoNLL 2005 suggests that the fiction texts are actually easier than the newswire texts. [sent-12, score-0.212]
</p><p>7 Building on recent efforts in domain adaptation, we develop unsupervised techniques for learning new representations of text. [sent-22, score-0.234]
</p><p>8 Using latent-variable language models, we learn representations of texts that provide novel kinds of features to our supervised learning algorithms. [sent-23, score-0.302]

</p><p>11 Typical representations in SRL and NLP use features of the local context to produce a representation. [sent-44, score-0.227]
</p><p>12 For instance, one dimension of a traditional represen-  tation R might be +1 if the instance contains the word “bank” as the head of a noun-phrase chunk that occurs before the predicate in the sentence, and 0 otherwise. [sent-45, score-0.422]
</p><p>13 In our recent work (Huang and Yates, 2009) we show how to build systems that learn new representations for open-domain NLP using latentvariable language models like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). [sent-48, score-0.233]
</p><p>14 The Vite|srbi algorithm (Rabiner, 1989) can then be used to produce the optimal sequence of latent states si for a given instance x. [sent-59, score-0.337]
</p><p>15 ’s criteria for open-domain representations: first, they are useful in making predictions on the training text because the HMM latent states categorize tokens according to distributional similarity. [sent-63, score-0.308]
</p><p>16 3  Experimental Setup  We test our open-domain semantic role labeling system using data from the CoNLL 2005 shared task (Carreras and M `arquez, 2005). [sent-66, score-0.265]
</p><p>17 Every sentence in the dataset is automatically annotated with a number of NLP pipeline systems, including part-of-speech (POS) tags, phrase chunk labels (Carreras and M `arquez, 2003), namedentity tags, and full parse information by multiple parsers. [sent-73, score-0.26]
</p><p>18 These pipeline systems are important for generating features for SRL, and one key reason for the poor performance of SRL systems on the Brown corpus is that the pipeline systems themselves perform worse. [sent-74, score-0.26]
</p><p>19 They use a discriminative reranking approach to jointly predict the best set of argument boundaries and the best set of argument la-  bels for a predicate. [sent-87, score-0.402]
</p><p>20 Owing to the established difficulty of the Brown test set and the different domains of the Brown test and WSJ training data, this dataset makes for an excellent testbed for open-domain semantic role labeling. [sent-91, score-0.328]
</p><p>21 While this task is almost trivial in the WSJ test set, where all but two out of over 5000 predicates can be observed in the training data, it is significantly more difficult in an open-domain setting. [sent-93, score-0.262]
</p><p>22 1% of the predicates do not appear in the training data, and 11. [sent-95, score-0.272]
</p><p>23 8% of the predicates appear at most twice in the training data (c. [sent-96, score-0.305]
</p><p>24 5% of the  WSJ test predicates that appear at most twice in training). [sent-99, score-0.307]
</p><p>25 5  Table 1: Using HMM features in predicate identification reduces error in out-of-domain tests by 34. [sent-118, score-0.473]
</p><p>26 There were 83 1 predicates in total; 51 never appeared in training and 98 appeared at most twice. [sent-122, score-0.276]
</p><p>27 as predicates in training may not be predicates in the test set. [sent-123, score-0.43]
</p><p>28 In an open-domain setting, therefore, we cannot rely solely on a catalog of predicates from the training data. [sent-124, score-0.214]
</p><p>29 To address the task of open-domain predicate identification, we construct a Conditional Random  Field (CRF) (Lafferty et al. [sent-125, score-0.227]
</p><p>30 1 We use words, POS tags, chunk labels, and the predicate label at the preceding and following nodes as features for our Baseline system. [sent-128, score-0.547]
</p><p>31 To learn an open-domain representation, we then trained an 80 state HMM on the unlabeled texts of the training and Brown test data, and used the Viterbi optimum states of each word as categorical features. [sent-129, score-0.375]
</p><p>32 For predicates that never or rarely appear in training, the HMM features increase F1 by 4. [sent-131, score-0.31]
</p><p>33 In all subsequent experiments, we fall back on the standard evaluation in which it is assumed that the boundaries of  the predicate are given. [sent-137, score-0.227]
</p><p>34 5  Semantic Role Labeling with HMM-based Representations  Following standard practice, we divide the SRL task into two parts: argument identification and 1Available from http://sourceforge. [sent-139, score-0.291]
</p><p>35 During argument identification, the system must label each token with labels that indicate either the beginning or interior of an argument (B-Arg or I-Arg), or a label that indicates the token is not part of an argument (O-Arg). [sent-142, score-0.871]
</p><p>36 During argument classification, the system labels each token that is part of an argument with a class label, such as Arg0 or ArgM. [sent-143, score-0.553]
</p><p>37 Following argument classification, multi-word arguments may have different classification labels for each token. [sent-144, score-0.342]
</p><p>38 During argument identification we use the features below to predict the label Ai for token wi:  words: wi, wi−1, and wi+1 • parts of speech (POS): POS tags ti, ti−1, and ti+1 • chunk labels: (e. [sent-155, score-0.664]
</p><p>39 1 Incorporating HMM-based Representations As a first step towards an open-domain representation, we use an HMM with 80 latent state values, trained on the unlabeled text of the training and test sets, to produce Viterbi-optimal state values si for every token in the corpus. [sent-161, score-0.538]
</p><p>40 2  Path Features  Despite all of the features above, the SRL system has very little information to help it determine the syntactic relationship between a target predicate and a potential argument. [sent-164, score-0.348]
</p><p>41 For instance, these baseline features provide only crude distance information to distinguish between multiple arguments that follow a predicate, and they make it difficult to correctly identify clause arguments or arguments that appear far from the predicate. [sent-165, score-0.501]
</p><p>42 As a step in this direction, we introduce path features: features for the sequence of tokens be-  971  System Baseline Baseline+HMM Baseline+HMM+Paths Toutanova et al. [sent-167, score-0.24]
</p><p>43 In standard SRL systems, these path features usually consist of a sequence of constituent parse nodes representing the shortest path through the parse tree between a word and the predicate (Gildea and  Jurafsky, 2002). [sent-184, score-0.529]
</p><p>44 We use four types of paths: word paths, POS paths, chunk paths, and HMM state paths. [sent-186, score-0.236]
</p><p>45 Given an input sentence labeled with POS tags, and chunks, we construct path features for a token wi by concatenating words (or tags or chunk labels) between wi and the predicate. [sent-187, score-0.565]
</p><p>46 For example, in the sentence “The HIV infection rate is expected to peak in 2010,” the word path between “rate” and predicate “peak” would be “is expected to”, and the POS path would be “VBZ VBD TO. [sent-188, score-0.445]
</p><p>47 ” Since word, POS, and chunk paths are all subject to data sparsity for arguments that are far from the predicate, we build less-sparse path features by using paths of HMM states. [sent-189, score-0.86]
</p><p>48 If we use a reasonable number of HMM states, each category label is much more common in the training data than the average word, and paths containing the HMM states should be much less sparse than word paths, and even chunk paths. [sent-190, score-0.567]
</p><p>49 We call the result of adding path features to  our feature set the Baseline+HMM+Paths system((BL). [sent-192, score-0.226]
</p><p>50 As with the HMM models above, the latent states for word spans can be thought of as probabilistic categories for the spans. [sent-200, score-0.485]
</p><p>51 And like the HMM models, we can turn the word span models into representations by using the state value for a span as a feature in our supervised SRL system. [sent-201, score-0.617]
</p><p>52 Unlike path features, the features from our models of word spans consist of a single latent state value rather than a concatenation of state values, and as a consequence they tend to be much less sparse in the training data. [sent-202, score-0.812]
</p><p>53 1 Span-HMM Representations We build our latent-variable models of word spans using variations of Hidden Markov Models, which we call Span-HMMs. [sent-204, score-0.303]
</p><p>54 Each Span-HMM behaves just like a regular HMM, except that it includes one node, called a span node, that can gen-  erate an entire span rather than a single word. [sent-206, score-0.328]
</p><p>55 For instance, in the Span-HMM of Figure 1, node y5 is a span node that generates a span of length 3: “is expected to. [sent-207, score-0.442]
</p><p>56 That is, at test time, we generate a Span-HMM feature for word wj by constructing a Span-HMM that has a span node for the sequence of words between wj and the predicate. [sent-209, score-0.269]
</p><p>57 We determine the Viterbi optimal state ofthis span node, and use that state as the value of the new feature. [sent-210, score-0.306]
</p><p>58 In our example in Figure 1, the value of span node y5 is used as a feature for 972  the token “rate”, since y5 generates the sequence of words between “rate” and the predicate “peak. [sent-211, score-0.507]
</p><p>59 ” Notice that by using Span-HMMs to provide these features, we have condensed all paths in our data into a small number of categorical values. [sent-212, score-0.218]
</p><p>60 Whereas there are a huge number of variations to the spans themselves, we can constrain the number  of categories for the Span-HMM states to a reasonable number such that each category is likely to appear often in the training data. [sent-213, score-0.447]
</p><p>61 The value of each Span-HMM state then represents a cluster of spans with similar delimiting words; some clusters will correlate with spans between predicates and arguments, and others with spans that do not connect predicates and arguments. [sent-214, score-1.13]
</p><p>62 First, we take every sentence S in our training data and generate the set Spans(S) of all valid spans in the sentence. [sent-219, score-0.287]
</p><p>63 For efficiency’s sake, we use only spans of length less than 15; approximately 95% of the arguments in our dataset were within  15 words of the predicate, so even with this restriction we are able to supply features for nearly all valid arguments. [sent-220, score-0.411]
</p><p>64 The second step of our training procedure is to create a separate data point for each span of S. [sent-221, score-0.21]
</p><p>65 For each span t ∈ Spans(S), we ceoacnhstr spucatn a Span-HMM hw spithan a regular nnos(dSe generating each element of S, except that a span node generates all of t. [sent-222, score-0.385]
</p><p>66 Intuitively, running Baum-Welch over this data means that a span node with state k will be likely to generate two spans t1 and t2 if t1 and t2 tend to appear in similar contexts. [sent-224, score-0.591]
</p><p>67 Thus, certain values of k will tend to appear for spans between predicates and arguments, and others will tend to appear between predicates and non-arguments. [sent-226, score-0.693]
</p><p>68 This makes the value k informative for both argument identification and argument classification. [sent-227, score-0.492]
</p><p>69 Since there are millions of different spans in our data, a straightforward implementation would require millions of parameters for each latent state of the Span-HMM. [sent-231, score-0.425]
</p><p>70 If we use a small enough number of latent states in the base HMM (in experiments, we use 10 latent states), we drastically reduce the number of different spans in the data set, and therefore the number of parameters required for our model. [sent-237, score-0.569]
</p><p>71 As with our other HMM-based models, we use the largest  s  number of latent states that will allow the resulting model to fit in our machine’s memory our previous experiments on representations for partof-speech tagging suggest that more latent states are usually better. [sent-239, score-0.606]
</p><p>72 Our second approach trains a separate Span-HMM model for spans of different lengths. [sent-241, score-0.241]
</p><p>73 We therefore use base HMM models with more latent states (up to 20) to annotate our sentences, and then train on the resulting Spans(ˆ s) as before. [sent-243, score-0.244]
</p><p>74 With this technique, we produce features that are combinations of the state value for span nodes and the length of the span, in order to indicate which of our Span-HMM models the state value came from. [sent-244, score-0.419]
</p><p>75 4 Combining Multiple Span-HMMs So far, our Span-HMM models produce one new feature for every token during argument identifi973  System Baseline+HMM+Paths Toutanova et al. [sent-247, score-0.289]
</p><p>76 While these new features may be very helpful, ideally we would like our learned representations to produce multiple  useful features for the CRF model, so that the CRF can combine the signals from each feature to learn a sophisticated model. [sent-265, score-0.34]
</p><p>77 When we decode each of the models on training and test texts, we will obtain N different sequences of latent states, one for each locally-optimized model. [sent-268, score-0.236]
</p><p>78 Figure 2 shows that when the argument is close to the predicate, both systems perform well, but as the distance from the predicate grows, our Multi-Span-HMM system is better able to identify and classify arguments than the Baseline+HMM+Paths system. [sent-303, score-0.583]
</p><p>79 Table 6 provides results for argument identification and classification separately. [sent-304, score-0.291]
</p><p>80 , 2007), SRL systems tend to have an easier time with porting argument identification to new domains, but are less strong at argument classification on new domains. [sent-307, score-0.524]
</p><p>81 9 for argument identification, but suffers a much larger 8% drop in argument classification. [sent-310, score-0.402]
</p><p>82 The Multi-Span-HMM model improves over the Baseline in both tasks and on both test sets, but the largest improvement (6%) is in argument classification on the Brown test set. [sent-311, score-0.297]
</p><p>83 Figure 2: The Multi-Span-HMM (MSH) model is better able to identify and classify arguments that are far from the predicate than the Baseline+HMM+Paths (BL) model. [sent-350, score-0.342]

</p><p>85 While word path features can be highly valuable when there is training data available for them, only about 11% of the word paths in the Brown test set also appeared at all in the training data. [sent-364, score-0.541]
</p><p>86 POS and chunk paths fared a bit better (22% and 33% respectively), but even then nearly 70% of all feature values had no available training data. [sent-365, score-0.388]
</p><p>87 Thus Span-  Figure 3: HMM path and Span-HMM features are far more likely to appear often in training data than the word, POS, and chunk path features. [sent-368, score-0.6]
</p><p>88 Over 70% of Span-HMM-Base10 features in the Brown corpus appear at least three times during training; in contrast, fewer than 33% of chunk path features in the Brown corpus appear at all during training. [sent-369, score-0.558]
</p><p>89 HMMs derive their power as representations for open-domain SRL from the fact that they provide  features that are mostly the same across domains; 80% of the features of our Span-HMM-Base10 in the Brown corpus were observed at least once in the training data. [sent-370, score-0.357]
</p><p>90 Table 7 shows examples of spans that were clustered into the same Span-HMM state, along with word to either side. [sent-371, score-0.241]
</p><p>91 The emission from a span node are very sparse, so the Span-HMM has unsurprisingly learned to cluster spans according to the HMM states that precede and follow the span node. [sent-374, score-0.728]
</p><p>92 One potentially interesting 975  Predicate  Span  B-Arg  picked passed come sat  the things up through the barbed wire down from Sundays over his second rock  from at to in  Table 7: Example spans labeled with the same Span-HMM state. [sent-376, score-0.241]
</p><p>93 question for future work is whether a less sparse model of the spans themselves, such as a Na¨ ıve Bayes model for the span node, would yield a better clustering for producing features for semantic role labeling. [sent-378, score-0.665]
</p><p>94 (2007b) also incorporate HMM-based representations into a system for the related task of Web information extraction, and are able to show that the system improves performance on rare terms. [sent-383, score-0.217]
</p><p>95 F ¨urstenau and Lapata (2009b; 2009a) use semisupervised techniques to automatically annotate data for previously unseen predicates with semantic role information. [sent-384, score-0.343]
</p><p>96 By incorporating learned features from HMMs and Span-HMMs trained on unlabeled text, our SRL system is able to correctly identify predicates in out-of-domain text with an F1 of 93. [sent-403, score-0.327]
</p><p>97 5, and it can identify and classify arguments to predicates with an F1 of 73. [sent-404, score-0.254]

Semantic role labeling techniques are typically trained on newswire text, and in tests their performance on fiction is as much as 19% worse than their performance on newswire text. We investigate techniques for building open-domain semantic role labeling systems that approach the ideal of a train-once, use-anywhere system.

<p>Author: Junhui Li ; Guodong Zhou ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: This paper explores joint syntactic and semantic parsing of Chinese to further improve the performance of both syntactic and semantic parsing, in particular the performance of semantic parsing (in this paper, semantic role labeling). This is done from two levels. Firstly, an integrated parsing approach is proposed to integrate semantic parsing into the syntactic parsing process. Secondly, semantic information generated by semantic parsing is incorporated into the syntactic parsing model to better capture semantic information in syntactic parsing. Evaluation on Chinese TreeBank, Chinese PropBank, and Chinese NomBank shows that our integrated parsing approach outperforms the pipeline parsing approach on n-best parse trees, a natural extension of the widely used pipeline parsing approach on the top-best parse tree. Moreover, it shows that incorporating semantic role-related information into the syntactic parsing model significantly improves the performance of both syntactic parsing and semantic parsing. To our best knowledge, this is the first research on exploring syntactic parsing and semantic role labeling for both verbal and nominal predicates in an integrated way. 1</p><p>3 0.37564319 <a title="184-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Starting_from_Scratch_in_Semantic_Role_Labeling.html">216 acl-2010-Starting from Scratch in Semantic Role Labeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Connor ; Yael Gertner ; Cynthia Fisher ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: A fundamental step in sentence comprehension involves assigning semantic roles to sentence constituents. To accomplish this, the listener must parse the sentence, find constituents that are candidate arguments, and assign semantic roles to those constituents. Each step depends on prior lexical and syntactic knowledge. Where do children learning their first languages begin in solving this problem? In this paper we focus on the parsing and argumentidentification steps that precede Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) training. We combine a simplified SRL with an unsupervised HMM part of speech tagger, and experiment with psycholinguisticallymotivated ways to label clusters resulting from the HMM so that they can be used to parse input for the SRL system. The results show that proposed shallow representations of sentence structure are robust to reductions in parsing accuracy, and that the contribution of alternative representations of sentence structure to successful semantic role labeling varies with the integrity of the parsing and argumentidentification stages.</p><p>4 0.36441618 <a title="184-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Semantics-Driven_Shallow_Parsing_for_Chinese_Semantic_Role_Labeling.html">207 acl-2010-Semantics-Driven Shallow Parsing for Chinese Semantic Role Labeling</a></p>

Frame-based systems currently make use of the FrameNet database but fail to show suitable generalization capabilities in out-of-domain scenarios. In this paper, a state-of-art system for frame-based SRL is extended through the encapsulation of a distributional model of semantic similarity. The resulting argument classification model promotes a simpler feature space that limits the potential overfitting effects. The large scale empirical study here discussed confirms that state-of-art accuracy can be obtained for out-of-domain evaluations.</p><p>6 0.77412653 <a title="184-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Improving_Chinese_Semantic_Role_Labeling_with_Rich_Syntactic_Features.html">146 acl-2010-Improving Chinese Semantic Role Labeling with Rich Syntactic Features</a></p>

However, it is not always easy to know what to compare and what are the alternatives. To address this difficulty, we present a novel way to automatically mine comparable entities from comparative questions that users posted online. To ensure high precision and high recall, we develop a weakly-supervised bootstrapping method for comparative question identification and comparable entity extraction by leveraging a large online question archive. The experimental results show our method achieves F1measure of 82.5% in comparative question identification and 83.3% in comparable entity extraction. Both significantly outperform an existing state-of-the-art method. 1</p><p>6 0.93878967 <a title="184-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Fully_Unsupervised_Core-Adjunct_Argument_Classification.html">120 acl-2010-Fully Unsupervised Core-Adjunct Argument Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Junhui Li ; Guodong Zhou ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: This paper explores joint syntactic and semantic parsing of Chinese to further improve the performance of both syntactic and semantic parsing, in particular the performance of semantic parsing (in this paper, semantic role labeling). This is done from two levels. Firstly, an integrated parsing approach is proposed to integrate semantic parsing into the syntactic parsing process. Secondly, semantic information generated by semantic parsing is incorporated into the syntactic parsing model to better capture semantic information in syntactic parsing. Evaluation on Chinese TreeBank, Chinese PropBank, and Chinese NomBank shows that our integrated parsing approach outperforms the pipeline parsing approach on n-best parse trees, a natural extension of the widely used pipeline parsing approach on the top-best parse tree. Moreover, it shows that incorporating semantic role-related information into the syntactic parsing model significantly improves the performance of both syntactic parsing and semantic parsing. To our best knowledge, this is the first research on exploring syntactic parsing and semantic role labeling for both verbal and nominal predicates in an integrated way. 1</p><p>3 0.4069486 <a title="146-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Semantics-Driven_Shallow_Parsing_for_Chinese_Semantic_Role_Labeling.html">207 acl-2010-Semantics-Driven Shallow Parsing for Chinese Semantic Role Labeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Weiwei Sun</p><p>Abstract: One deficiency of current shallow parsing based Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) methods is that syntactic chunks are too small to effectively group words. To partially resolve this problem, we propose semantics-driven shallow parsing, which takes into account both syntactic structures and predicate-argument structures. We also introduce several new “path” features to improve shallow parsing based SRL method. Experiments indicate that our new method obtains a significant improvement over the best reported Chinese SRL result.</p><p>4 0.27066496 <a title="146-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Open-Domain_Semantic_Role_Labeling_by_Modeling_Word_Spans.html">184 acl-2010-Open-Domain Semantic Role Labeling by Modeling Word Spans</a></p>
<p>Author: Fei Huang ; Alexander Yates</p><p>Abstract: Most supervised language processing systems show a significant drop-off in performance when they are tested on text that comes from a domain significantly different from the domain of the training data. Semantic role labeling techniques are typically trained on newswire text, and in tests their performance on fiction is as much as 19% worse than their performance on newswire text. We investigate techniques for building open-domain semantic role labeling systems that approach the ideal of a train-once, use-anywhere system. We leverage recently-developed techniques for learning representations of text using latent-variable language models, and extend these techniques to ones that provide the kinds of features that are useful for semantic role labeling. In experiments, our novel system reduces error by 16% relative to the previous state of the art on out-of-domain text.</p><p>5 0.2013371 <a title="146-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Starting_from_Scratch_in_Semantic_Role_Labeling.html">216 acl-2010-Starting from Scratch in Semantic Role Labeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Connor ; Yael Gertner ; Cynthia Fisher ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: A fundamental step in sentence comprehension involves assigning semantic roles to sentence constituents. To accomplish this, the listener must parse the sentence, find constituents that are candidate arguments, and assign semantic roles to those constituents. Each step depends on prior lexical and syntactic knowledge. Where do children learning their first languages begin in solving this problem? In this paper we focus on the parsing and argumentidentification steps that precede Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) training. We combine a simplified SRL with an unsupervised HMM part of speech tagger, and experiment with psycholinguisticallymotivated ways to label clusters resulting from the HMM so that they can be used to parse input for the SRL system. The results show that proposed shallow representations of sentence structure are robust to reductions in parsing accuracy, and that the contribution of alternative representations of sentence structure to successful semantic role labeling varies with the integrity of the parsing and argumentidentification stages.</p><p>6 0.19496478 <a title="146-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Edit_Tree_Distance_Alignments_for_Semantic_Role_Labelling.html">94 acl-2010-Edit Tree Distance Alignments for Semantic Role Labelling</a></p>

<p>Author: Myroslava O. Dzikovska ; Johanna D. Moore ; Natalie Steinhauser ; Gwendolyn Campbell</p><p>Abstract: Supporting natural language input may improve learning in intelligent tutoring systems. However, interpretation errors are unavoidable and require an effective recovery policy. We describe an evaluation of an error recovery policy in the BEETLE II tutorial dialogue system and discuss how different types of interpretation problems affect learning gain and user satisfaction. In particular, the problems arising from student use of non-standard terminology appear to have negative consequences. We argue that existing strategies for dealing with terminology problems are insufficient and that improving such strategies is important in future ITS research.</p><p>2 0.87263584 <a title="146-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Automatic_Evaluation_Method_for_Machine_Translation_Using_Noun-Phrase_Chunking.html">37 acl-2010-Automatic Evaluation Method for Machine Translation Using Noun-Phrase Chunking</a></p>
<p>Author: Hiroshi Echizen-ya ; Kenji Araki</p><p>Abstract: As described in this paper, we propose a new automatic evaluation method for machine translation using noun-phrase chunking. Our method correctly determines the matching words between two sentences using corresponding noun phrases. Moreover, our method determines the similarity between two sentences in terms of the noun-phrase order of appearance. Evaluation experiments were conducted to calculate the correlation among human judgments, along with the scores produced us- ing automatic evaluation methods for MT outputs obtained from the 12 machine translation systems in NTCIR7. Experimental results show that our method obtained the highest correlations among the methods in both sentence-level adequacy and fluency.</p><p>3 0.84326649 <a title="146-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Learning_to_Follow_Navigational_Directions.html">168 acl-2010-Learning to Follow Navigational Directions</a></p>
<p>Author: Adam Vogel ; Dan Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: We present a system that learns to follow navigational natural language directions. Where traditional models learn from linguistic annotation or word distributions, our approach is grounded in the world, learning by apprenticeship from routes through a map paired with English descriptions. Lacking an explicit alignment between the text and the reference path makes it difficult to determine what portions of the language describe which aspects of the route. We learn this correspondence with a reinforcement learning algorithm, using the deviation of the route we follow from the intended path as a reward signal. We demonstrate that our system successfully grounds the meaning of spatial terms like above and south into geometric properties of paths.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.77768534 <a title="146-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Improving_Chinese_Semantic_Role_Labeling_with_Rich_Syntactic_Features.html">146 acl-2010-Improving Chinese Semantic Role Labeling with Rich Syntactic Features</a></p>

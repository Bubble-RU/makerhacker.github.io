<p>Author: Min Zhang ; Hui Zhang ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a convolution forest kernel to effectively explore rich structured features embedded in a packed parse forest. As opposed to the convolution tree kernel, the proposed forest kernel does not have to commit to a single best parse tree, is thus able to explore very large object spaces and much more structured features embedded in a forest. This makes the proposed kernel more robust against parsing errors and data sparseness issues than the convolution tree kernel. The paper presents the formal definition of convolution forest kernel and also illustrates the computing algorithm to fast compute the proposed convolution forest kernel. Experimental results on two NLP applications, relation extraction and semantic role labeling, show that the proposed forest kernel significantly outperforms the baseline of the convolution tree kernel. 1</p><p>3 0.36105773 <a title="155-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Discourse_Structure%3A_Theory%2C_Practice_and_Use.html">86 acl-2010-Discourse Structure: Theory, Practice and Use</a></p>

<p>Author: Jun Sun ; Min Zhang ; Chew Lim Tan</p><p>Abstract: We propose Bilingual Tree Kernels (BTKs) to capture the structural similarities across a pair of syntactic translational equivalences and apply BTKs to sub-tree alignment along with some plain features. Our study reveals that the structural features embedded in a bilingual parse tree pair are very effective for sub-tree alignment and the bilingual tree kernels can well capture such features. The experimental results show that our approach achieves a significant improvement on both gold standard tree bank and automatically parsed tree pairs against a heuristic similarity based method. We further apply the sub-tree alignment in machine translation with two methods. It is suggested that the subtree alignment benefits both phrase and syntax based systems by relaxing the constraint of the word alignment. 1</p><p>5 0.26444492 <a title="155-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Assessing_the_Role_of_Discourse_References_in_Entailment_Inference.html">33 acl-2010-Assessing the Role of Discourse References in Entailment Inference</a></p>

<p>Author: Wenliang Chen ; Jun'ichi Kazama ; Kentaro Torisawa</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a dependency parsing method that uses bilingual constraints to improve the accuracy of parsing bilingual texts (bitexts). In our method, a targetside tree fragment that corresponds to a source-side tree fragment is identified via word alignment and mapping rules that are automatically learned. Then it is verified by checking the subtree list that is collected from large scale automatically parsed data on the target side. Our method, thus, requires gold standard trees only on the source side of a bilingual corpus in the training phase, unlike the joint parsing model, which requires gold standard trees on the both sides. Compared to the reordering constraint model, which requires the same training data as ours, our method achieved higher accuracy because ofricher bilingual constraints. Experiments on the translated portion of the Chinese Treebank show that our system outperforms monolingual parsers by 2.93 points for Chinese and 1.64 points for English.</p><p>3 0.84481323 <a title="155-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-The_Use_of_Formal_Language_Models_in_the_Typology_of_the_Morphology_of_Amerindian_Languages.html">234 acl-2010-The Use of Formal Language Models in the Typology of the Morphology of Amerindian Languages</a></p>
<p>Author: Andres Osvaldo Porta</p><p>Abstract: The aim of this work is to present some preliminary results of an investigation in course on the typology of the morphology of the native South American languages from the point of view of the formal language theory. With this object, we give two contrasting examples of descriptions of two Aboriginal languages finite verb forms morphology: Argentinean Quechua (quichua santiague n˜o) and Toba. The description of the morphology of the finite verb forms of Argentinean quechua, uses finite automata and finite transducers. In this case the construction is straightforward using two level morphology and then, describes in a very natural way the Argentinean Quechua morphology using a regular language. On the contrary, the Toba verbs morphology, with a system that simultaneously uses prefixes and suffixes, has not a natural description as regular language. Toba has a complex system of causative suffixes, whose successive applications determinate the use of prefixes belonging different person marking prefix sets. We adopt the solution of Creider et al. (1995) to naturally deal with this and other similar morphological processes which involve interactions between prefixes and suffixes and then we describe the toba morphology using linear context-free languages.1 .</p><p>4 0.84402144 <a title="155-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Learning_Word-Class_Lattices_for_Definition_and_Hypernym_Extraction.html">166 acl-2010-Learning Word-Class Lattices for Definition and Hypernym Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Roberto Navigli ; Paola Velardi</p><p>Abstract: Definition extraction is the task of automatically identifying definitional sentences within texts. The task has proven useful in many research areas including ontology learning, relation extraction and question answering. However, current approaches mostly focused on lexicosyntactic patterns suffer from both low recall and precision, as definitional sentences occur in highly variable syntactic structures. In this paper, we propose WordClass Lattices (WCLs), a generalization of word lattices that we use to model textual definitions. Lattices are learned from a dataset of definitions from Wikipedia. Our method is applied to the task of definition and hypernym extraction and compares favorably to other pattern general– – ization methods proposed in the literature.</p><p>5 0.83971781 <a title="155-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Supervised_Noun_Phrase_Coreference_Research%3A_The_First_Fifteen_Years.html">219 acl-2010-Supervised Noun Phrase Coreference Research: The First Fifteen Years</a></p>
<p>Author: Vincent Ng</p><p>Abstract: The research focus of computational coreference resolution has exhibited a shift from heuristic approaches to machine learning approaches in the past decade. This paper surveys the major milestones in supervised coreference research since its inception fifteen years ago.</p><p>6 0.83882374 <a title="155-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Hard_Constraints_for_Grammatical_Function_Labelling.html">130 acl-2010-Hard Constraints for Grammatical Function Labelling</a></p>

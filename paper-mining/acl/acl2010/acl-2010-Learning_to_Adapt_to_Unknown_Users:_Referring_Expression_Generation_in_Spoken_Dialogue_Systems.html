<p>Author: Verena Rieser ; Oliver Lemon ; Xingkun Liu</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to Information Presentation (IP) in Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) using a data-driven statistical optimisation framework for content planning and attribute selection. First we collect data in a Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) experiment and use it to build a supervised model of human behaviour. This forms a baseline for measuring the performance of optimised policies, developed from this data using Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. We show that the optimised policies significantly outperform the baselines in a variety of generation scenarios: while the supervised model is able to attain up to 87.6% of the possible reward on this task, the RL policies are significantly better in 5 out of 6 scenarios, gaining up to 91.5% of the total possible reward. The RL policies perform especially well in more complex scenarios. We are also the first to show that adding predictive “lower level” features (e.g. from the NLG realiser) is important for optimising IP strategies according to user preferences. This provides new insights into the nature of the IP problem for SDS.</p><p>3 0.28544766 <a title="167-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Towards_Relational_POMDPs_for_Adaptive_Dialogue_Management.html">239 acl-2010-Towards Relational POMDPs for Adaptive Dialogue Management</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre Lison</p><p>Abstract: Open-ended spoken interactions are typically characterised by both structural complexity and high levels of uncertainty, making dialogue management in such settings a particularly challenging problem. Traditional approaches have focused on providing theoretical accounts for either the uncertainty or the complexity of spoken dialogue, but rarely considered the two issues simultaneously. This paper describes ongoing work on a new approach to dialogue management which attempts to fill this gap. We represent the interaction as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) over a rich state space incorporating both dialogue, user, and environment models. The tractability of the resulting POMDP can be preserved using a mechanism for dynamically constraining the action space based on prior knowledge over locally relevant dialogue structures. These constraints are encoded in a small set of general rules expressed as a Markov Logic network. The first-order expressivity of Markov Logic enables us to leverage the rich relational structure of the problem and efficiently abstract over large regions ofthe state and action spaces.</p><p>4 0.26357144 <a title="167-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Learning_to_Follow_Navigational_Directions.html">168 acl-2010-Learning to Follow Navigational Directions</a></p>

We learn this correspondence with a reinforcement learning algorithm, using the deviation of the route we follow from the intended path as a reward signal.

<p>Author: S.R.K. Branavan ; Luke Zettlemoyer ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the task of mapping high-level instructions to sequences of commands in an external environment. Processing these instructions is challenging—they posit goals to be achieved without specifying the steps required to complete them. We describe a method that fills in missing information using an automatically derived environment model that encodes states, transitions, and commands that cause these transitions to happen. We present an efficient approximate approach for learning this environment model as part of a policygradient reinforcement learning algorithm for text interpretation. This design enables learning for mapping high-level instructions, which previous statistical methods cannot handle.1</p><p>6 0.22430663 <a title="167-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Beetle_II%3A_A_System_for_Tutoring_and_Computational_Linguistics_Experimentation.html">47 acl-2010-Beetle II: A System for Tutoring and Computational Linguistics Experimentation</a></p>

<p>Author: Ethan Selfridge ; Peter Heeman</p><p>Abstract: Current turn-taking approaches for spoken dialogue systems rely on the speaker releasing the turn before the other can take it. This reliance results in restricted interactions that can lead to inefficient dialogues. In this paper we present a model we refer to as Importance-Driven Turn-Bidding that treats turn-taking as a negotiative process. Each conversant bids for the turn based on the importance of the intended utterance, and Reinforcement Learning is used to indirectly learn this parameter. We find that Importance-Driven Turn-Bidding performs better than two current turntaking approaches in an artificial collaborative slot-filling domain. The negotiative nature of this model creates efficient dia- logues, and supports the improvement of mixed-initiative interaction.</p><p>4 0.79328096 <a title="167-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Towards_Relational_POMDPs_for_Adaptive_Dialogue_Management.html">239 acl-2010-Towards Relational POMDPs for Adaptive Dialogue Management</a></p>

<p>Author: S.R.K. Branavan ; Luke Zettlemoyer ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the task of mapping high-level instructions to sequences of commands in an external environment. Processing these instructions is challenging—they posit goals to be achieved without specifying the steps required to complete them. We describe a method that fills in missing information using an automatically derived environment model that encodes states, transitions, and commands that cause these transitions to happen. We present an efficient approximate approach for learning this environment model as part of a policygradient reinforcement learning algorithm for text interpretation. This design enables learning for mapping high-level instructions, which previous statistical methods cannot handle.1</p><p>4 0.76408178 <a title="167-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-The_Impact_of_Interpretation_Problems_on_Tutorial_Dialogue.html">227 acl-2010-The Impact of Interpretation Problems on Tutorial Dialogue</a></p>
<p>Author: Myroslava O. Dzikovska ; Johanna D. Moore ; Natalie Steinhauser ; Gwendolyn Campbell</p><p>Abstract: Supporting natural language input may improve learning in intelligent tutoring systems. However, interpretation errors are unavoidable and require an effective recovery policy. We describe an evaluation of an error recovery policy in the BEETLE II tutorial dialogue system and discuss how different types of interpretation problems affect learning gain and user satisfaction. In particular, the problems arising from student use of non-standard terminology appear to have negative consequences. We argue that existing strategies for dealing with terminology problems are insufficient and that improving such strategies is important in future ITS research.</p><p>5 0.7588768 <a title="167-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Beetle_II%3A_A_System_for_Tutoring_and_Computational_Linguistics_Experimentation.html">47 acl-2010-Beetle II: A System for Tutoring and Computational Linguistics Experimentation</a></p>

Callaway</p><p>Abstract: We present BEETLE II, a tutorial dialogue system designed to accept unrestricted language input and support experimentation with different tutorial planning and dialogue strategies. Our first system evaluation used two different tutorial policies and demonstrated that the system can be successfully used to study the impact of different approaches to tutoring. In the future, the system can also be used to experiment with a variety ofnatural language interpretation and generation techniques.</p><p>6 0.75825381 <a title="167-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Optimising_Information_Presentation_for_Spoken_Dialogue_Systems.html">187 acl-2010-Optimising Information Presentation for Spoken Dialogue Systems</a></p>

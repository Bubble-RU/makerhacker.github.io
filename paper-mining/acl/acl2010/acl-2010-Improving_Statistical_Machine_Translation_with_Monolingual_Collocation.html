<p>Author: Jian-Cheng Wu ; Yu-Chia Chang ; Teruko Mitamura ; Jason S. Chang</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, collocation has been widely acknowledged as an essential characteristic to distinguish native speakers from non-native speakers. Research on academic writing has also shown that collocations are not only common but serve a particularly important discourse function within the academic community. In our study, we propose a machine learning approach to implementing an online collocation writing assistant. We use a data-driven classifier to provide collocation suggestions to improve word choices, based on the result of classifica- tion. The system generates and ranks suggestions to assist learners’ collocation usages in their academic writing with satisfactory results. 1</p><p>3 0.43293422 <a title="147-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Collocation_Extraction_beyond_the_Independence_Assumption.html">60 acl-2010-Collocation Extraction beyond the Independence Assumption</a></p>

<p>Author: Vamshi Ambati ; Stephan Vogel ; Jaime Carbonell</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised word alignment aims to improve the accuracy of automatic word alignment by incorporating full or partial manual alignments. Motivated by standard active learning query sampling frameworks like uncertainty-, margin- and query-by-committee sampling we propose multiple query strategies for the alignment link selection task. Our experiments show that by active selection of uncertain and informative links, we reduce the overall manual effort involved in elicitation of alignment link data for training a semisupervised word aligner.</p><p>5 0.3106271 <a title="147-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-Hierarchical_Search_for_Word_Alignment.html">133 acl-2010-Hierarchical Search for Word Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Riesa ; Daniel Marcu</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple yet powerful hierarchical search algorithm for automatic word alignment. Our algorithm induces a forest of alignments from which we can efficiently extract a ranked k-best list. We score a given alignment within the forest with a flexible, linear discriminative model incorporating hundreds of features, and trained on a relatively small amount of annotated data. We report results on Arabic-English word alignment and translation tasks. Our model outperforms a GIZA++ Model-4 baseline by 6.3 points in F-measure, yielding a 1.1 BLEU score increase over a state-of-the-art syntax-based machine translation system.</p><p>6 0.28201938 <a title="147-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Diversify_and_Combine%3A_Improving_Word_Alignment_for_Machine_Translation_on_Low-Resource_Languages.html">90 acl-2010-Diversify and Combine: Improving Word Alignment for Machine Translation on Low-Resource Languages</a></p>

<p>Author: Bing Xiang ; Yonggang Deng ; Bowen Zhou</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method to improve word alignment quality and eventually the translation performance by producing and combining complementary word alignments for low-resource languages. Instead of focusing on the improvement of a single set of word alignments, we generate multiple sets of diversified alignments based on different motivations, such as linguistic knowledge, morphology and heuristics. We demonstrate this approach on an English-to-Pashto translation task by combining the alignments obtained from syntactic reordering, stemming, and partial words. The combined alignment outperforms the baseline alignment, with significantly higher F-scores and better transla- tion performance.</p><p>5 0.46830362 <a title="147-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Word_Alignment_with_Synonym_Regularization.html">262 acl-2010-Word Alignment with Synonym Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Hiroyuki Shindo ; Akinori Fujino ; Masaaki Nagata</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel framework for word alignment that incorporates synonym knowledge collected from monolingual linguistic resources in a bilingual probabilistic model. Synonym information is helpful for word alignment because we can expect a synonym to correspond to the same word in a different language. We design a generative model for word alignment that uses synonym information as a regularization term. The experimental results show that our proposed method significantly improves word alignment quality.</p><p>6 0.4612667 <a title="147-lsi-6" href="./acl-2010-Active_Learning-Based_Elicitation_for_Semi-Supervised_Word_Alignment.html">24 acl-2010-Active Learning-Based Elicitation for Semi-Supervised Word Alignment</a></p>

<p>Author: Ashish Vaswani ; Adam Pauls ; David Chiang</p><p>Abstract: The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle is a method for model selection that trades off between the explanation of the data by the model and the complexity of the model itself. Inspired by the MDL principle, we develop an objective function for generative models that captures the description of the data by the model (log-likelihood) and the description of the model (model size). We also develop a efficient general search algorithm based on the MAP-EM framework to optimize this function. Since recent work has shown that minimizing the model size in a Hidden Markov Model for part-of-speech (POS) tagging leads to higher accuracies, we test our approach by applying it to this problem. The search algorithm involves a simple change to EM and achieves high POS tagging accuracies on both English and Italian data sets.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.88669914 <a title="147-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Improving_Statistical_Machine_Translation_with_Monolingual_Collocation.html">147 acl-2010-Improving Statistical Machine Translation with Monolingual Collocation</a></p>

<p>Author: Wenbin Jiang ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we describe an intuitionistic method for dependency parsing, where a classifier is used to determine whether a pair of words forms a dependency edge. And we also propose an effective strategy for dependency projection, where the dependency relationships of the word pairs in the source language are projected to the word pairs of the target language, leading to a set of classification instances rather than a complete tree. Experiments show that, the classifier trained on the projected classification instances significantly outperforms previous projected dependency parsers. More importantly, when this clas- , sifier is integrated into a maximum spanning tree (MST) dependency parser, obvious improvement is obtained over the MST baseline.</p><p>4 0.81804317 <a title="147-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Speech-Driven_Access_to_the_Deep_Web_on_Mobile_Devices.html">215 acl-2010-Speech-Driven Access to the Deep Web on Mobile Devices</a></p>

<p>Author: Liang Huang ; Kenji Sagae</p><p>Abstract: Incremental parsing techniques such as shift-reduce have gained popularity thanks to their efficiency, but there remains a major problem: the search is greedy and only explores a tiny fraction of the whole space (even with beam search) as opposed to dynamic programming. We show that, surprisingly, dynamic programming is in fact possible for many shift-reduce parsers, by merging “equivalent” stacks based on feature values. Empirically, our algorithm yields up to a five-fold speedup over a state-of-the-art shift-reduce depen- dency parser with no loss in accuracy. Better search also leads to better learning, and our final parser outperforms all previously reported dependency parsers for English and Chinese, yet is much faster.</p><p>6 0.62606609 <a title="147-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Diversify_and_Combine%3A_Improving_Word_Alignment_for_Machine_Translation_on_Low-Resource_Languages.html">90 acl-2010-Diversify and Combine: Improving Word Alignment for Machine Translation on Low-Resource Languages</a></p>

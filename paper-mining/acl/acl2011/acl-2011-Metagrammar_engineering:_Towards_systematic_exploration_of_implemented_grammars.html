</p><p>3 Iargue that metagrammar engineering as an approach facilitates the systematic exploration of grammars through comparison of competing analyses. [sent-6, score-0.737]
</p><p>4 The idea is illustrated through a comparative study of auxiliary structures in HPSG-based grammars for German and Dutch. [sent-7, score-0.454]
</p><p>5 The standard methodology involves either picking one analysis, and seeing how it goes, then backing out if it does not work out, or laboriously adapting a grammar to two versions supporting different analyses (Bender, 2010). [sent-12, score-0.581]
</p><p>6 The former approach is not in any way systematic, increasing the risk that the grammar is far from optimal in terms of efficiency. [sent-13, score-0.323]
</p><p>7 The latter approach potentially causes the grammar engineer an amount of work that will not scale for considering many different phenomena. [sent-14, score-0.454]
</p><p>8 This paper proposes a more systematic and tractable alternative to grammar development: metagrammar engineering. [sent-15, score-0.881]
</p><p>9 The key idea is that the grammar engineer adds alternative plausable analyses for linguistic phenomena to a metagrammar. [sent-17, score-0.808]
</p><p>10 This metagrammar can generate all possible combinations of these analyses automatically, creating different versions of a grammar that cover the same phenomena. [sent-18, score-1.059]
</p><p>11 The engineer can test directly how competing analyses for different phenomena interact, and determine which combinations are possible (after minor adaptations) and which analyses are incompatible. [sent-19, score-0.657]

</p><p>14 The relevant linguistic properties and alternative analyses are described in Sections 3 and 4. [sent-29, score-0.314]
</p><p>15 After evaluating and discussing the case study’s results, Ireturn to the general approach of metagrammar engineering. [sent-30, score-0.446]
</p><p>16 It is followed by a conclusion and discussion on using metagrammars as a methodology for grammar engineering. [sent-32, score-0.373]
</p><p>17 More importantly, the Germanic metagrammar is implemented as a special branch of the LinGO Grammar Matrix  and uses a significant amount of its code. [sent-38, score-0.487]
</p><p>18 The Grammar Matrix customization system allows users to derive a starter grammar for a particular language from a common multi-lingual resource by specifying linguistic properties through a webbased questionnaire. [sent-39, score-0.536]
</p><p>19 After the starter grammar has been created, its development continues independently: engineers can thus make modifications to their grammar without affecting the multi-lingual resource. [sent-42, score-0.74]
</p><p>20 The customization system takes this choices file as input to create grammar fragments, using so-called “libraries” that contain implementations of cross-linguistically variable phenomena. [sent-44, score-0.611]
</p><p>21 Depending on the definitions provided in the choices file, different analyses are retrieved from the customization system’s libraries. [sent-45, score-0.411]
</p><p>22 The language specific implementations inherit from a core grammar which handles basic phrase types, semantic compo-  sitionality and general infrastructure, such as feature geometry (Bender et al. [sent-46, score-0.362]
</p><p>23 The present study is part of a larger effort to improve the customization library for auxiliary structures in free word order and verb second languages. [sent-48, score-0.603]
</p><p>24 2 Germanic branch In order to create grammars for Germanic languages, a specialized branch of the Grammar Matrix customization system was developed. [sent-52, score-0.408]
</p><p>25 At present, the generator uses the Grammar Matrix analyses for agreement and case marking as well as basics from its morphotactics,  coordination and lexicon implementations. [sent-54, score-0.276]
</p><p>26 In the first stage, the word order library and auxiliary implementation were extended to cover two alternative analyses for Germanic word order (see Section 4). [sent-55, score-0.682]
</p><p>27 The coordination library was adapted to ensure correct interactions with the new word order analyses and agreement. [sent-56, score-0.282]
</p><p>28 Both versions of word order analyses can be tweaked to include or exclude a rarely occurring variant of partial VP fronting (see Section 4. [sent-59, score-0.349]

</p><p>31 Danish results are not presented, because the language auxiliary flip: under certain conditions in subordinate clauses, the finite verb precedes all other verbal forms. [sent-80, score-0.434]
</p><p>32 Most Dutch auxiliaries can occur in both orders, but this may be restricted according to their verb form. [sent-88, score-0.314]
</p><p>33 Four groups of auxiliary verbs can be distinguished that have different syntactic restrictions. [sent-89, score-0.295]

</p><p>35 Our system can both generate a Flemish grammar accepting all of the above and a (Northern) Dutch grammar, rejecting the third variant. [sent-107, score-0.323]
</p><p>36 4  Alternative auxiliary approaches  This section presents the alternative analyses for auxiliary-verb structures in Germanic languages compared in this study. [sent-108, score-0.614]
</p><p>37 1 Argument-composition The standard analysis for German and Dutch auxiliaries in HPSG is a so-called “argumentcomposition” analysis (Hinrichs and Nakazawa, 1994), which Iwill explain through the following Dutch example:4 (1) Ik zou het boek willen lezen. [sent-111, score-0.454]
</p><p>38 ” In the sentence above, the auxiliary willen “want” separates the verb lezen “read” from its object het 2Note that the same orders as in the Right Brackets may also occur in the Vorfeld (with or without the object). [sent-114, score-0.529]
</p><p>39 A parser respecting surface order can thus not combine lezen and het boek before combining willen and lezen. [sent-117, score-0.273]
</p><p>40 The subcategorization of an auxiliary under this analysis is presented in Figure 1. [sent-119, score-0.315]
</p><p>41 Its complement list consists of the concatenation of the verbal complement and any complement this verbal complement may select for. [sent-121, score-0.638]
</p><p>42 The problem lies in the fact that lexical entries of auxiliaries have underspecified elements on their subcategorization lists. [sent-127, score-0.314]
</p><p>43 With the current chart parsing and chart generation algorithms (Carroll and Oepen, 2005), an auxiliary in a language with flexible word order will speculatively add edges to the chart for potential analyses with the adjacent constituent as subject or complement. [sent-128, score-0.572]
</p><p>44 In the worse case scenario, the number of edges created by an auxiliary grows exponentially in the number of words and constituents in the string. [sent-130, score-0.302]
</p><p>45 The efficiency problem is even worse for generation: while the parser is restricted by the surface order of 5In the semantic representation, both arguments will be diGerman auxiliary flip. [sent-131, score-0.357]
</p><p>46 The analysis introduces auxiliaries that only subcategorize for one verbal complement, not raising any of the complement’s ar-  guments or its subject. [sent-137, score-0.293]
</p><p>47 The difference is that the auxiliary now starts out with only one element in its subcategorization lists and can only combine with potential verbal complements that are appropriately constrained. [sent-141, score-0.394]
</p><p>48 The structure that combines the auxiliary with its complement places the remaining elements on the complement’s SUBJ and COMPS lists on the respective lists of the newly formed phrase, as can be seen in Figure 2 (ii). [sent-142, score-0.375]
</p><p>49 Because the verb hebben cannot combine with its complement, it cannot raise its complement’s arguments either: the auxiliary+verb analysis only permits raising when auxiliary and complement combine. [sent-149, score-0.541]
</p><p>50 However, a correct grammar should be able to analyze and produce all grammatical structures. [sent-153, score-0.323]
</p><p>51 In the ideal case, the full coverage version will remain efficient enough as the grammar grows. [sent-156, score-0.368]
</p><p>52 But if this turns out not to be the case, the decision can be made to exclude the additional rule from the grammar or to use it as a robustness rule that is only called when regular rules fail. [sent-157, score-0.323]
</p><p>53 Given the metagrammar engineering approach, it will be straightforward to decide at a later point to exclude the special rule, if corpus studies reveal this is favourable. [sent-158, score-0.493]
</p><p>54 1 Experimental set-up As described above, the Germanic metagrammar is a branch of the customization system. [sent-160, score-0.618]
</p><p>55 7 The choices files defined artificial grammars with a dummy vocabulary. [sent-166, score-0.274]
</p><p>56 The created choices files were extended offline to define those properties that the Germanic metagrammar captures, but are not incorporated in the Matrix customization system. [sent-169, score-0.721]
</p><p>57 This included word order of the auxiliary and complement, fixed or free argument order, influence of inflection on word order,  a more elaborate case hierarchy, ditransitive verbs, and the choice of auxiliary/verb analysis. [sent-170, score-0.425]
</p><p>58 Four choices files with different combinations of analyses were created for each language, resulting in 12 choices files in total. [sent-171, score-0.426]
</p><p>59 For each verb and auxiliary combination, all permissible word orders were defined based on descriptive resources. [sent-174, score-0.355]
</p><p>60 Each language has both a complete set for the 6 grammars that provide full coverage, and a reduced set for the 6 grammars that can not handle split verbal clusters (see Section 4. [sent-177, score-0.403]
</p><p>61 net/matrix/ Each grammar was created using the metagram-  mar, ensuring that all components except the competing analyses were held constant among compared grammars. [sent-181, score-0.575]
</p><p>62 Note that all directly compared grammars have the same empirical coverage (100% coverage and 0% overgeneration on the phenomena included in the test suites). [sent-187, score-0.368]
</p><p>63 Three tests per grammar were carried out: one on positive data, one on negative data and one on the complete dataset. [sent-189, score-0.323]
</p><p>64 The results show that the auxiliary+verb (aux+v) leads to a more efficient grammar according to all measures used. [sent-192, score-0.323]
</p><p>65 Due to the more liberal order of arguments, results are even worse for German: the argument-composition grammar reaches its limit with the first auxiliary for ditransitive verbs. [sent-206, score-0.71]
</p><p>66 4 In summary The results of the experiment presented above show that avoiding underspecified subcategorization lists, as found in the standard argument-composition analysis, significantly increases the efficiency of the grammar for both parsing and generation. [sent-209, score-0.492]
</p><p>67 In generation experiments,  results are even more impressive: the reduction of edges for German sentences with one auxiliary and a ditransitve verb is at least 98. [sent-214, score-0.437]
</p><p>68 In addition to providing a clearer picture of auxiliary structures, these extensions will also lead to a better insight into efforts involved in using grammar generation to explore alternative versions of a grammar over time. [sent-223, score-1.072]
</p><p>69 In particular, it should provide an indication of the feasibility of maintaining a higher number of competing analyses as the grammar grows. [sent-224, score-0.575]
</p><p>70 After providing background on related metagrammar projects and their goals, Iwill elaborate on the importance of systematic exploration of grammars in the discussion. [sent-225, score-0.678]
</p><p>71 6  Related work  Metagrammars (or grammar generators) have been established in the field for over a decade. [sent-226, score-0.323]
</p><p>72 The purpose of the library is to allow engineers working on NLP applications to write simple grammar rules that can call more complex syntactic implementations from the grammar library. [sent-240, score-0.776]
</p><p>73 The grammar library is written by researchers code sharing: general categories and constructions that are used by all languages are implemented in  a core syntax grammar. [sent-241, score-0.41]
</p><p>74 The main purpose of PAWS lies in descriptive grammar writing and “computer-assisted related language adaptation”, where the grammar is used to map words from a text in a source language to a target language. [sent-245, score-0.646]
</p><p>75 PAWS differs from the other projects discussed here, because grammar engineering or syntactic research are not the main focus of the project. [sent-246, score-0.37]
</p><p>76 Like the other projects reviewed here, the Grammar Matrix does not offer alternative analyses for the same phenomenon. [sent-249, score-0.282]
</p><p>77 By using a metagrammar to store alternative analyses, grammars can be explored systematically over time. [sent-252, score-0.688]
</p><p>78 As such, the paper introduces a novel methodology for grammar engineering. [sent-253, score-0.323]
</p><p>79 An engineer may implement alternative solutions and test the impact on the grammar concerning interaction with other phenomena (Bierwisch, 1963; M ¨uller, 1999; Bender, 2008; Bender et al. [sent-257, score-0.606]
</p><p>80 However, it is not feasible to carry out compara-  tive tests by manually creating different versions of a grammar every time a decision about an implementation is made. [sent-261, score-0.379]
</p><p>81 Moreover, even if such a study were carried out at each stage, only the interaction with the current state of the grammar would be tested. [sent-262, score-0.323]
</p><p>82 Second, because each decision is only based on the current state of the grammar, the resulting grammar is partially (or even largely) a product of the order in which phenomena are treated. [sent-265, score-0.428]
</p><p>83 10 For grammar engineers with practical applications in mind, this is undesirable because the resulting grammar may end up far from optimal. [sent-266, score-0.722]
</p><p>84 For grammar writers that use engineering to find valid linguistic analyses, the problem is even more serious: if there is a truth in a declarative grammar, surely, this should not depend on the order in which phenomena are treated. [sent-267, score-0.475]
</p><p>85 2 Metagrammar engineering This paper proposes to systematically explore analyses throughout the development of a grammar by  writing a metagrammar (or grammar generator), rather than directly implementing the grammar. [sent-269, score-1.341]
</p><p>86 A metagrammar can contain several different analyses for the same phenomenon. [sent-270, score-0.648]
</p><p>87 After adding a new phenomenon to the metagrammar, the engineer can automatically generate versions of the grammar containing different combinations of previous analyses. [sent-271, score-0.544]
</p><p>88 As a result, the engineer can not only systematically explore how alternative analyses interact with the current grammar, but also continue to explore interactions with phenomena added in the future. [sent-272, score-0.533]
</p><p>89 Especially for alternative approaches to basic properties of the language, such as the auxiliary-verb structures examined in this study, parallel analyses may prevent the cumbersome scenario of changing a deeply embedded property of a large grammar. [sent-273, score-0.351]
</p><p>90 An additional advantage is that the engineer can use the methodology to make different versions of the grammar depending on its intended application. [sent-274, score-0.51]
</p><p>91 In practice, the large effort involved will only be undertaken if the advantages are apparent For instance, it is possible to develop a highly restricted version for grammar checking that provides  detailed feedback on detected errors (Bender et al. [sent-276, score-0.323]
</p><p>92 The grammar engineer still needs to decide which alternatives are the most promising and therefore the most important to implement and maintain. [sent-279, score-0.494]
</p><p>93 The resulting grammar therefore partially remains a result of the order in which phenomena are implemented. [sent-280, score-0.428]
</p><p>94 Nevertheless, the grammar engineer can keep and try out solutions in parallel for a longer time, increasing the possibility of exploring more alternative versions of the grammar. [sent-281, score-0.59]
</p><p>95 In addition, by breaking up analyses into possible alternatives, chances are that the resulting metagrammar  will be more modular than a directly written grammar would have been, which facilitates exploring alternatives further. [sent-283, score-1.011]

<p>Author: Antske Fokkens</p><p>Abstract: When designing grammars of natural language, typically, more than one formal analysis can account for a given phenomenon. Moreover, because analyses interact, the choices made by the engineer influence the possibilities available in further grammar development. The order in which phenomena are treated may therefore have a major impact on the resulting grammar. This paper proposes to tackle this problem by using metagrammar development as a methodology for grammar engineering. Iargue that metagrammar engineering as an approach facilitates the systematic exploration of grammars through comparison of competing analyses. The idea is illustrated through a comparative study of auxiliary structures in HPSG-based grammars for German and Dutch. Auxiliaries form a central phenomenon of German and Dutch and are likely to influence many components of the grammar. This study shows that a special auxiliary+verb construction significantly improves efficiency compared to the standard argument-composition analysis for both parsing and generation.</p><p>2 0.1315755 <a title="219-tfidf-2" href="./acl-2011-Insertion_Operator_for_Bayesian_Tree_Substitution_Grammars.html">173 acl-2011-Insertion Operator for Bayesian Tree Substitution Grammars</a></p>
<p>Author: Hiroyuki Shindo ; Akinori Fujino ; Masaaki Nagata</p><p>Abstract: We propose a model that incorporates an insertion operator in Bayesian tree substitution grammars (BTSG). Tree insertion is helpful for modeling syntax patterns accurately with fewer grammar rules than BTSG. The experimental parsing results show that our model outperforms a standard PCFG and BTSG for a small dataset. For a large dataset, our model obtains comparable results to BTSG, making the number of grammar rules much smaller than with BTSG.</p><p>3 0.11136777 <a title="219-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Learning_Hierarchical_Translation_Structure_with_Linguistic_Annotations.html">202 acl-2011-Learning Hierarchical Translation Structure with Linguistic Annotations</a></p>
<p>Author: Markos Mylonakis ; Khalil Sima'an</p><p>Abstract: While it is generally accepted that many translation phenomena are correlated with linguistic structures, employing linguistic syntax for translation has proven a highly non-trivial task. The key assumption behind many approaches is that translation is guided by the source and/or target language parse, employing rules extracted from the parse tree or performing tree transformations. These approaches enforce strict constraints and might overlook important translation phenomena that cross linguistic constituents. We propose a novel flexible modelling approach to introduce linguistic information of varying granularity from the source side. Our method induces joint probability synchronous grammars and estimates their parameters, by select- ing and weighing together linguistically motivated rules according to an objective function directly targeting generalisation over future data. We obtain statistically significant improvements across 4 different language pairs with English as source, mounting up to +1.92 BLEU for Chinese as target.</p><p>4 0.10596572 <a title="219-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Judging_Grammaticality_with_Tree_Substitution_Grammar_Derivations.html">188 acl-2011-Judging Grammaticality with Tree Substitution Grammar Derivations</a></p>
<p>Author: Matt Post</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we show that local features computed from the derivations of tree substitution grammars such as the identify of particular fragments, and a count of large and small fragments are useful in binary grammatical classification tasks. Such features outperform n-gram features and various model scores by a wide margin. Although they fall short of the performance of the hand-crafted feature set of Charniak and Johnson (2005) developed for parse tree reranking, they do so with an order of magnitude fewer features. Furthermore, since the TSGs employed are learned in a Bayesian setting, the use of their derivations can be viewed as the automatic discovery of tree patterns useful for classification. On the BLLIP dataset, we achieve an accuracy of 89.9% in discriminating between grammatical text and samples from an n-gram language model. — —</p><p>5 0.0969804 <a title="219-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Unary_Constraints_for_Efficient_Context-Free_Parsing.html">316 acl-2011-Unary Constraints for Efficient Context-Free Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathan Bodenstab ; Kristy Hollingshead ; Brian Roark</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel pruning method for context-free parsing that increases efficiency by disallowing phrase-level unary productions in CKY chart cells spanning a single word. Our work is orthogonal to recent work on “closing” chart cells, which has focused on multi-word constituents, leaving span-1 chart cells unpruned. We show that a simple discriminative classifier can learn with high accuracy which span-1 chart cells to close to phrase-level unary productions. Eliminating these unary productions from the search can have a large impact on downstream processing, depending on implementation details of the search. We apply our method to four parsing architectures and demonstrate how it is complementary to the cell-closing paradigm, as well as other pruning methods such as coarse-to-fine, agenda, and beam-search pruning.</p><p>6 0.09442021 <a title="219-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Underspecifying_and_Predicting_Voice_for_Surface_Realisation_Ranking.html">317 acl-2011-Underspecifying and Predicting Voice for Surface Realisation Ranking</a></p>

<p>Author: Antske Fokkens</p><p>Abstract: When designing grammars of natural language, typically, more than one formal analysis can account for a given phenomenon. Moreover, because analyses interact, the choices made by the engineer influence the possibilities available in further grammar development. The order in which phenomena are treated may therefore have a major impact on the resulting grammar. This paper proposes to tackle this problem by using metagrammar development as a methodology for grammar engineering. Iargue that metagrammar engineering as an approach facilitates the systematic exploration of grammars through comparison of competing analyses. The idea is illustrated through a comparative study of auxiliary structures in HPSG-based grammars for German and Dutch. Auxiliaries form a central phenomenon of German and Dutch and are likely to influence many components of the grammar. This study shows that a special auxiliary+verb construction significantly improves efficiency compared to the standard argument-composition analysis for both parsing and generation.</p><p>2 0.68759155 <a title="219-lsi-2" href="./acl-2011-Underspecifying_and_Predicting_Voice_for_Surface_Realisation_Ranking.html">317 acl-2011-Underspecifying and Predicting Voice for Surface Realisation Ranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Sina Zarriess ; Aoife Cahill ; Jonas Kuhn</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses a data-driven surface realisation model based on a large-scale reversible grammar of German. We investigate the relationship between the surface realisation performance and the character of the input to generation, i.e. its degree of underspecification. We extend a syntactic surface realisation system, which can be trained to choose among word order variants, such that the candidate set includes active and passive variants. This allows us to study the interaction of voice and word order alternations in realistic German corpus data. We show that with an appropriately underspecified input, a linguistically informed realisation model trained to regenerate strings from the underlying semantic representation achieves 91.5% accuracy (over a baseline of 82.5%) in the prediction of the original voice. 1</p><p>3 0.64286596 <a title="219-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-The_Surprising_Variance_in_Shortest-Derivation_Parsing.html">300 acl-2011-The Surprising Variance in Shortest-Derivation Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohit Bansal ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We investigate full-scale shortest-derivation parsing (SDP), wherein the parser selects an analysis built from the fewest number of training fragments. Shortest derivation parsing exhibits an unusual range of behaviors. At one extreme, in the fully unpruned case, it is neither fast nor accurate. At the other extreme, when pruned with a coarse unlexicalized PCFG, the shortest derivation criterion becomes both fast and surprisingly effective, rivaling more complex weighted-fragment approaches. Our analysis includes an investigation of tie-breaking and associated dynamic programs. At its best, our parser achieves an accuracy of 87% F1 on the English WSJ task with minimal annotation, and 90% F1 with richer annotation.</p><p>4 0.63559043 <a title="219-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-P11-5002_k2opt.pdf.html">239 acl-2011-P11-5002 k2opt.pdf</a></p>

<p>Author: Siwei Wang ; Gina-Anne Levow</p><p>Abstract: Verbal feedback is an important information source in establishing interactional rapport. However, predicting verbal feedback across languages is challenging due to languagespecific differences, inter-speaker variation, and the relative sparseness and optionality of verbal feedback. In this paper, we employ an approach combining classifier weighting and SMOTE algorithm oversampling to improve verbal feedback prediction in Arabic, English, and Spanish dyadic conversations. This approach improves the prediction of verbal feedback, up to 6-fold, while maintaining a high overall accuracy. Analyzing highly weighted features highlights widespread use of pitch, with more varied use of intensity and duration.</p><p>2 0.94837469 <a title="219-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Using_Cross-Entity_Inference_to_Improve_Event_Extraction.html">328 acl-2011-Using Cross-Entity Inference to Improve Event Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Yu Hong ; Jianfeng Zhang ; Bin Ma ; Jianmin Yao ; Guodong Zhou ; Qiaoming Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Event extraction is the task of detecting certain specified types of events that are mentioned in the source language data. The state-of-the-art research on the task is transductive inference (e.g. cross-event inference). In this paper, we propose a new method of event extraction by well using cross-entity inference. In contrast to previous inference methods, we regard entitytype consistency as key feature to predict event mentions. We adopt this inference method to improve the traditional sentence-level event extraction system. Experiments show that we can get 8.6% gain in trigger (event) identification, and more than 11.8% gain for argument (role) classification in ACE event extraction. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.93431383 <a title="219-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Metagrammar_engineering%3A_Towards_systematic_exploration_of_implemented_grammars.html">219 acl-2011-Metagrammar engineering: Towards systematic exploration of implemented grammars</a></p>

<p>Author: Hajime Senuma</p><p>Abstract: One of the major problems of K-means is that one must use dense vectors for its centroids, and therefore it is infeasible to store such huge vectors in memory when the feature space is high-dimensional. We address this issue by using feature hashing (Weinberger et al., 2009), a dimension-reduction technique, which can reduce the size of dense vectors while retaining sparsity of sparse vectors. Our analysis gives theoretical motivation and justification for applying feature hashing to Kmeans, by showing how much will the objective of K-means be (additively) distorted. Furthermore, to empirically verify our method, we experimented on a document clustering task.</p><p>5 0.91264069 <a title="219-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-From_Bilingual_Dictionaries_to_Interlingual_Document_Representations.html">139 acl-2011-From Bilingual Dictionaries to Interlingual Document Representations</a></p>
<p>Author: Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi ; Hal Daume III ; Raghavendra Udupa</p><p>Abstract: Mapping documents into an interlingual representation can help bridge the language barrier of a cross-lingual corpus. Previous approaches use aligned documents as training data to learn an interlingual representation, making them sensitive to the domain of the training data. In this paper, we learn an interlingual representation in an unsupervised manner using only a bilingual dictionary. We first use the bilingual dictionary to find candidate document alignments and then use them to find an interlingual representation. Since the candidate alignments are noisy, we de- velop a robust learning algorithm to learn the interlingual representation. We show that bilingual dictionaries generalize to different domains better: our approach gives better performance than either a word by word translation method or Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) trained on a different domain.</p><p>6 0.91167682 <a title="219-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Nonparametric_Bayesian_Machine_Transliteration_with_Synchronous_Adaptor_Grammars.html">232 acl-2011-Nonparametric Bayesian Machine Transliteration with Synchronous Adaptor Grammars</a></p>

<p>Author: Tim Van de Cruys ; Marianna Apidianaki</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified model for the automatic induction of word senses from text, and the subsequent disambiguation of particular word instances using the automatically extracted sense inventory. The induction step and the disambiguation step are based on the same principle: words and contexts are mapped to a limited number of topical dimensions in a latent semantic word space. The intuition is that a particular sense is associated with a particular topic, so that different senses can be discriminated through their association with particular topical dimensions; in a similar vein, a particular instance of a word can be disambiguated by determining its most important topical dimensions. The model is evaluated on the SEMEVAL-20 10 word sense induction and disambiguation task, on which it reaches stateof-the-art results.</p><p>3 0.23745634 <a title="307-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Identification_of_Domain-Specific_Senses_in_a_Machine-Readable_Dictionary.html">158 acl-2011-Identification of Domain-Specific Senses in a Machine-Readable Dictionary</a></p>
<p>Author: Fumiyo Fukumoto ; Yoshimi Suzuki</p><p>Abstract: This paper focuses on domain-specific senses and presents a method for assigning category/domain label to each sense of words in a dictionary. The method first identifies each sense of a word in the dictionary to its corresponding category. We used a text classification technique to select appropriate senses for each domain. Then, senses were scored by computing the rank scores. We used Markov Random Walk (MRW) model. The method was tested on English and Japanese resources, WordNet 3.0 and EDR Japanese dictionary. For evaluation of the method, we compared English results with the Subject Field Codes (SFC) resources. We also compared each English and Japanese results to the first sense heuristics in the WSD task. These results suggest that identification of domain-specific senses (IDSS) may actually be of benefit.</p><p>4 0.16452292 <a title="307-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-ParaSense_or_How_to_Use_Parallel_Corpora_for_Word_Sense_Disambiguation.html">240 acl-2011-ParaSense or How to Use Parallel Corpora for Word Sense Disambiguation</a></p>
<p>Author: Els Lefever ; Veronique Hoste ; Martine De Cock</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a set of exploratory experiments for a multilingual classificationbased approach to Word Sense Disambiguation. Instead of using a predefined monolingual sense-inventory such as WordNet, we use a language-independent framework where the word senses are derived automatically from word alignments on a parallel corpus. We built five classifiers with English as an input language and translations in the five supported languages (viz. French, Dutch, Italian, Spanish and German) as classification output. The feature vectors incorporate both the more traditional local context features, as well as binary bag-of-words features that are extracted from the aligned translations. Our results show that the ParaSense multilingual WSD system shows very competitive results compared to the best systems that were evaluated on the SemEval-2010 Cross-Lingual Word Sense Disambiguation task for all five target languages.</p><p>5 0.15400076 <a title="307-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Improving_Dependency_Parsing_with_Semantic_Classes.html">167 acl-2011-Improving Dependency Parsing with Semantic Classes</a></p>
<p>Author: Eneko Agirre ; Kepa Bengoetxea ; Koldo Gojenola ; Joakim Nivre</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents the introduction of WordNet semantic classes in a dependency parser, obtaining improvements on the full Penn Treebank for the first time. We tried different combinations of some basic semantic classes and word sense disambiguation algorithms. Our experiments show that selecting the adequate combination of semantic features on development data is key for success. Given the basic nature of the semantic classes and word sense disambiguation algorithms used, we think there is ample room for future improvements. 1</p><p>6 0.14287995 <a title="307-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Models_and_Training_for_Unsupervised_Preposition_Sense_Disambiguation.html">224 acl-2011-Models and Training for Unsupervised Preposition Sense Disambiguation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jayant Krishnamurthy ; Tom Mitchell</p><p>Abstract: Resolving polysemy and synonymy is required for high-quality information extraction. We present ConceptResolver, a component for the Never-Ending Language Learner (NELL) (Carlson et al., 2010) that handles both phenomena by identifying the latent concepts that noun phrases refer to. ConceptResolver performs both word sense induction and synonym resolution on relations extracted from text using an ontology and a small amount of labeled data. Domain knowledge (the ontology) guides concept creation by defining a set of possible semantic types for concepts. Word sense induction is performed by inferring a set of semantic types for each noun phrase. Synonym detection exploits redundant informa- tion to train several domain-specific synonym classifiers in a semi-supervised fashion. When ConceptResolver is run on NELL’s knowledge base, 87% of the word senses it creates correspond to real-world concepts, and 85% of noun phrases that it suggests refer to the same concept are indeed synonyms.</p><p>5 0.68951547 <a title="307-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Together_We_Can%3A_Bilingual_Bootstrapping_for_WSD.html">304 acl-2011-Together We Can: Bilingual Bootstrapping for WSD</a></p>
<p>Author: Mitesh M. Khapra ; Salil Joshi ; Arindam Chatterjee ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: Recent work on bilingual Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) has shown that a resource deprived language (L1) can benefit from the annotation work done in a resource rich language (L2) via parameter projection. However, this method assumes the presence of sufficient annotated data in one resource rich language which may not always be possible. Instead, we focus on the situation where there are two resource deprived languages, both having a very small amount of seed annotated data and a large amount of untagged data. We then use bilingual bootstrapping, wherein, a model trained using the seed annotated data of L1 is used to annotate the untagged data of L2 and vice versa using parameter projection. The untagged instances of L1 and L2 which get annotated with high confidence are then added to the seed data of the respective languages and the above process is repeated. Our experiments show that such a bilingual bootstrapping algorithm when evaluated on two different domains with small seed sizes using Hindi (L1) and Marathi (L2) as the language pair performs better than monolingual bootstrapping and significantly reduces annotation cost.</p><p>6 0.67419928 <a title="307-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Good_Seed_Makes_a_Good_Crop%3A_Accelerating_Active_Learning_Using_Language_Modeling.html">145 acl-2011-Good Seed Makes a Good Crop: Accelerating Active Learning Using Language Modeling</a></p>

<p>Author: Ryo Nagata ; Edward Whittaker ; Vera Sheinman</p><p>Abstract: The availability of learner corpora, especially those which have been manually error-tagged or shallow-parsed, is still limited. This means that researchers do not have a common development and test set for natural language processing of learner English such as for grammatical error detection. Given this background, we created a novel learner corpus that was manually error-tagged and shallowparsed. This corpus is available for research and educational purposes on the web. In this paper, we describe it in detail together with its data-collection method and annotation schemes. Another contribution of this paper is that we take the first step toward evaluating the performance of existing POStagging/chunking techniques on learner corpora using the created corpus. These contributions will facilitate further research in related areas such as grammatical error detection and automated essay scoring.</p><p>3 0.72709519 <a title="307-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Prototyping_virtual_instructors_from_human-human_corpora.html">252 acl-2011-Prototyping virtual instructors from human-human corpora</a></p>
<p>Author: Luciana Benotti ; Alexandre Denis</p><p>Abstract: Virtual instructors can be used in several applications, ranging from trainers in simulated worlds to non player characters for virtual games. In this paper we present a novel algorithm for rapidly prototyping virtual instructors from human-human corpora without manual annotation. Automatically prototyping full-fledged dialogue systems from corpora is far from being a reality nowadays. Our algorithm is restricted in that only the virtual instructor can perform speech acts while the user responses are limited to physical actions in the virtual world. We evaluate a virtual instructor, generated using this algorithm, with human users. We compare our results both with human instructors and rule-based virtual instructors hand-coded for the same task.</p><p>4 0.72568774 <a title="307-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Optimal_and_Syntactically-Informed_Decoding_for_Monolingual_Phrase-Based_Alignment.html">235 acl-2011-Optimal and Syntactically-Informed Decoding for Monolingual Phrase-Based Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Kapil Thadani ; Kathleen McKeown</p><p>Abstract: The task of aligning corresponding phrases across two related sentences is an important component of approaches for natural language problems such as textual inference, paraphrase detection and text-to-text generation. In this work, we examine a state-of-the-art structured prediction model for the alignment task which uses a phrase-based representation and is forced to decode alignments using an approximate search approach. We propose instead a straightforward exact decoding technique based on integer linear programming that yields order-of-magnitude improvements in decoding speed. This ILP-based decoding strategy permits us to consider syntacticallyinformed constraints on alignments which significantly increase the precision of the model.</p><p>5 0.72461945 <a title="307-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-An_Affect-Enriched_Dialogue_Act_Classification_Model_for_Task-Oriented_Dialogue.html">33 acl-2011-An Affect-Enriched Dialogue Act Classification Model for Task-Oriented Dialogue</a></p>
<p>Author: Kristy Boyer ; Joseph Grafsgaard ; Eun Young Ha ; Robert Phillips ; James Lester</p><p>Abstract: Dialogue act classification is a central challenge for dialogue systems. Although the importance of emotion in human dialogue is widely recognized, most dialogue act classification models make limited or no use of affective channels in dialogue act classification. This paper presents a novel affect-enriched dialogue act classifier for task-oriented dialogue that models facial expressions of users, in particular, facial expressions related to confusion. The findings indicate that the affectenriched classifiers perform significantly better for distinguishing user requests for feedback and grounding dialogue acts within textual dialogue. The results point to ways in which dialogue systems can effectively leverage affective channels to improve dialogue act classification. 1</p><p>6 0.72368819 <a title="307-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Latent_Semantic_Word_Sense_Induction_and_Disambiguation.html">198 acl-2011-Latent Semantic Word Sense Induction and Disambiguation</a></p>

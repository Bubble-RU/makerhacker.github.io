</p><p>8 This paper provides a snapshot of preliminary, ongoing research in predicting two classes of language use: 1 http://www-nlpir. [sent-14, score-0.147]

</p><p>10 Technical challenges include dealing with the facts that those LUs are rare and subjective and that human judgments have low agreement. [sent-22, score-0.297]
</p><p>11 Because the phenomena are rare, always predicting the absence of a LU is a very high baseline. [sent-25, score-0.206]
</p><p>12 2  Language Uses (LUs)  A language use refers to an aspect of the social intention of how a communicator uses language. [sent-28, score-0.244]
</p><p>13 The information that supports a decision about an implicit social action or role is likely to be distributed over more than one turn in a dialog; therefore, a language use is defined, annotated, and predicted across a thread in the dialog. [sent-29, score-0.591]
</p><p>14 Because our current work uses discussion forums, threads provide a natural, explicit unit of analysis. [sent-30, score-0.278]
</p><p>15 An Attempt-to-Persuade occurs when a poster  tries to convince other participants to change their beliefs or actions over the course of a thread. [sent-32, score-0.227]
</p><p>16 Typically, there is at least some resistance on the part of the posters being persuaded. [sent-33, score-0.051]
</p><p>17 To distinguish between actual persuasion and discussions that involve differing opinions, a poster needs to engage Proceedings ofP thoer t4l9atnhd A, Onrnuegaoln M,e Jeuntineg 19 o-f2 t4h,e 2 A0s1s1o. [sent-34, score-0.388]

</p><p>21 Data selection focused on the number  of messages and posters in a thread, as well as the frequency of known indicators like quotations. [sent-47, score-0.188]
</p><p>22 Elsewhere, similar, iterative annotation processes have yielded significant improvements in agreement for word sense and coreference (Hovy et al. [sent-51, score-0.094]
</p><p>23 While LUs were annotated for a poster over the full thread, annotators also marked specific messages in the thread for presence of evidence of the language use. [sent-53, score-0.733]
</p><p>24 Table 1 includes annotator consistency at both the evidence (message) and LU level. [sent-54, score-0.193]
</p><p>25 Discussions suggested that disagreement did not come from a misunderstand-  ing of the task but was the result of differing intuitions about difficult-to-define labels. [sent-61, score-0.185]
</p><p>26 The task is to predict for every participant in a given thread, whether the participant exhibits Attempt-to-Persuade and/or Establish-Credibility. [sent-64, score-0.244]
</p><p>27 If there is insufficient evidence of an LU for a participant, then the LU value for that poster is negative. [sent-65, score-0.197]
</p><p>28 Internally we measured predictions of message-level evidence as well. [sent-67, score-0.18]
</p><p>29 For English, 139 threads from Google Groups and LiveJournal have been annotated for Attempt-to-Persuade, and 103 threads for Attempt-to-Establish-Credibility. [sent-69, score-0.475]
</p><p>30 Due to low annotator agreement, attempting to resolve annotation disagreement by the  standard adjudication process was too timeconsuming. [sent-75, score-0.361]
</p><p>31 Instead, the evaluation scheme, similar to the pyramid scheme used for summarization evaluation, assigns scores to each example based on its level of agreement among the annotators. [sent-76, score-0.092]
</p><p>32 Specifically, each example is assigned positive and negative scores, p = n+/N and n = n-/N, where is the number of annotators that annotate the example as positive, and n for the negative. [sent-77, score-0.138]
</p><p>33 A system that outputs positive on the example results in p correct and n incorrect. [sent-79, score-0.05]
</p><p>34 The system gets p incorrect and n correct for predicting negative. [sent-80, score-0.096]
</p><p>35 Each example xi is associated with positive and negative scores, pi and ni. [sent-83, score-0.166]
</p><p>36 Let ri = 1 if the system outputs positive for example xi and 0 for negative. [sent-84, score-0.089]
</p><p>37 The partial accuracy, recall, precision, and Fmeasure can be computed by: pA = 100×∑i(ripi+(1-ri)ni) / ∑i(pi+ni) pR = 100×∑iripi / ∑ipi pP = 100× ∑iripi / ∑iri pF = 2 pR pP/(pR+pP) The maximum pA and pF may be less than 100 when there is disagreement between annotators. [sent-85, score-0.132]
</p><p>38 npA = 100×pA/max(pA) npF = 100×pF/max(pF) 4 URLs and judgments are available by email. [sent-87, score-0.071]
</p><p>39 We process a thread in three stages: (1) linguistic analysis of each message (post) to yield features, (2) Prediction of message-level properties using an SVM on the extracted features, and (3) Simple rules that predict language uses over the thread. [sent-89, score-0.504]
</p><p>40 Figure 1: Mes age and LU Prediction  Phase 1: The SERIF Information Extraction Engine extracts features which are designed to capture different aspects of the posts. [sent-90, score-0.038]
</p><p>41 The features in-  clude simple features that can be extracted from the surface text of the posts and the structure of the posts within the threads. [sent-91, score-0.236]

</p><p>43 The motivation for this level is (1) Posts provide a compact unit with reliably extractable, specific, explicit features. [sent-105, score-0.046]
</p><p>44 (3) Pointing to posts offers a more clear justification for the predictions. [sent-107, score-0.118]
</p><p>45 (4) In our experiments, errors here do not seem to percolate to the thread level. [sent-108, score-0.313]
</p><p>46 In 343 fact, accuracy at the message level is not directly predictive of accuracy at the thread level. [sent-109, score-0.494]
</p><p>47 Phase 3: Given the infrequency of the Attemptto-Persuade and Establish-Credibility LUs, we wrote a few rules to predict LUs over threads, given the predictions at the message level. [sent-110, score-0.278]
</p><p>48 For instance, if the number of messages with evidence for persuasion is greater than 2 from a given participant, then the system predicts AttemptToPersuade. [sent-111, score-0.45]
</p><p>49 To predict that a poster is exhibiting the Attempt-to-Persuade LU, the system need not find every piece of evidence that the LU is present, but rather just needs to find sufficient evidence for identifying the LU. [sent-113, score-0.403]
</p><p>50 Our message level classifiers were trained with an SVM that optimizes F-measure (Joachims, 2005). [sent-114, score-0.181]
</p><p>51 Because annotation disagreement is a major challenge, we experimented with various ways to account for (and make use of) noisy, dual annotat-  ed text. [sent-115, score-0.18]
</p><p>52 removing examples with disagreement; treating an example as negative if any annotator marked the example negative; and treating an example as positive if any annotator marked the example as positive. [sent-118, score-0.289]
</p><p>53 An alternative (and more principled) approach is to incorporate positive and negative scores for each example into the optimization procedure. [sent-119, score-0.089]
</p><p>54 Because each example was annotated by the same number of annotators (2 in this case), we are able to treat each annotator’s decision as an independent example without augmenting the SVM optimization process. [sent-120, score-0.086]
</p><p>55 Table 4Table 3 shows results for predicting message level evidence of an LU (Phase 2). [sent-126, score-0.37]
</p><p>56 Table 5Table 4 shows performance on the task of predicting an LU for each poster. [sent-127, score-0.096]
</p><p>57 Additionally, Arabic messages are much shorter, and the phenomena is even more rare (as illustrated by the high npA, accuracy, of the A baseline). [sent-129, score-0.349]
</p><p>58 like our dataset, each example in the external evaluation dataset was annotated by 3 annotators. [sent-130, score-0.037]

</p><p>60 Models and predictions in this field have primarily used simple word-based features, e. [sent-141, score-0.087]
</p><p>61 Social science researchers have studied how social roles develop in online communities (Fisher, et al. [sent-144, score-0.328]
</p><p>62 , 2006), and have attempted to categorize these roles in multiple ways (Golder and Donath 2004; Turner et al. [sent-145, score-0.128]
</p><p>63 (2007) have investigated the feasibility of detecting such roles automatically using posting frequency (but not the content of the messages). [sent-148, score-0.165]
</p><p>64 Sentiment analysis requires understanding the  implicit nature of the text. [sent-149, score-0.071]
</p><p>65 Work on perspective and sentiment analysis frequently uses a corpus known to be rich in sentiment such as reviews or editorials (e. [sent-150, score-0.247]
</p><p>66 Both the MPQA corpus and the various corpora of editorials and reviews have tended towards more formal, edited, non-conversational text. [sent-154, score-0.194]
</p><p>67 Our work in contrast, specifically targets interactive discussions in an informal setting. [sent-155, score-0.149]
</p><p>68 Work outside of computational linguistics that has looked at persuasion has tended to examine language in a persuasive context (e. [sent-156, score-0.219]
</p><p>69 Their work focuses on chat transcripts in an experimental setting designed to be rich in the phenomena of interest. [sent-161, score-0.11]
</p><p>70 Like our work, their predictions operate over the conversation, and not a single utterance. [sent-162, score-0.087]
</p><p>71 We work with threaded online discussions in which the phenomena in question are rare. [sent-165, score-0.175]
</p><p>72 Our annotators and system must distinguish between the language use and text that is opinionated without an intention to persuade or establish credibility. [sent-166, score-0.182]
</p><p>73 7  Conclusions and Future Work  In this work in progress, we presented a hybrid statistical & rule-based approach to detecting properties not explicitly stated, but evident from language use. [sent-167, score-0.037]
</p><p>74 Annotation at the message (turn) level provided training data useful for predicting rare phenomena at the discussion level while reducing the need for turn-level predictions to be accurate. [sent-168, score-0.681]
</p><p>75 Weighing subjective judgments overcame the need for high annotator consistency. [sent-169, score-0.243]
</p><p>76 For English, the system beats both baselines with respect to accuracy and F, despite the fact that because the phenomena are rare, always predicting the absence of a language use is a high baseline. [sent-170, score-0.273]
</p><p>77 This work has explored LUs, the implicit, social  purpose behind the words of a message. [sent-172, score-0.157]
</p><p>78 Future work will explore incorporating LU predictions to predict the social roles played by the participants in a thread, for example using persuasion and credibility to establish which participants in a discussion are serving as informal leaders. [sent-173, score-0.912]

To date Ihave defined a comprehensive set of social events and built a preliminary system that extracts social events from news articles. Iplan to improve the performance of my current system by incorporating semantic information. Using domain adaptation techniques, Ipropose to apply my system to a wide range of genres. By extracting linguistic constructs relevant to social interactions, I will be able to empirically analyze different kinds of linguistic constructs that people use to express social interactions.

<p>Author: Jui-Yu Weng ; Cheng-Lun Yang ; Bo-Nian Chen ; Yen-Kai Wang ; Shou-De Lin</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a system to summarize a Microblog post and its responses with the goal to provide readers a more constructive and concise set of information for efficient digestion. We introduce a novel two-phase summarization scheme. In the first phase, the post plus its responses are classified into four categories based on the intention, interrogation, sharing, discussion and chat. For each type of post, in the second phase, we exploit different strategies, including opinion analysis, response pair identification, and response relevancy detection, to summarize and highlight critical information to display. This system provides an alternative thinking about machinesummarization: by utilizing AI approaches, computers are capable of constructing deeper and more user-friendly abstraction. 1</p><p>4 0.1176804 <a title="194-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-MemeTube%3A_A_Sentiment-based_Audiovisual_System_for_Analyzing_and_Displaying_Microblog_Messages.html">218 acl-2011-MemeTube: A Sentiment-based Audiovisual System for Analyzing and Displaying Microblog Messages</a></p>

<p>Author: Sara Rosenthal ; Kathleen McKeown</p><p>Abstract: We investigate whether wording, stylistic choices, and online behavior can be used to predict the age category of blog authors. Our hypothesis is that significant changes in writing style distinguish pre-social media bloggers from post-social media bloggers. Through experimentation with a range of years, we found that the birth dates of students in college at the time when social media such as AIM, SMS text messaging, MySpace and Facebook first became popular, enable accurate age prediction. We also show that internet writing characteristics are important features for age prediction, but that lexical content is also needed to produce significantly more accurate results. Our best results allow for 81.57% accuracy.</p><p>6 0.10606055 <a title="194-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-C-Feel-It%3A_A_Sentiment_Analyzer_for_Micro-blogs.html">64 acl-2011-C-Feel-It: A Sentiment Analyzer for Micro-blogs</a></p>

<p>Author: Sara Rosenthal ; Kathleen McKeown</p><p>Abstract: We investigate whether wording, stylistic choices, and online behavior can be used to predict the age category of blog authors. Our hypothesis is that significant changes in writing style distinguish pre-social media bloggers from post-social media bloggers. Through experimentation with a range of years, we found that the birth dates of students in college at the time when social media such as AIM, SMS text messaging, MySpace and Facebook first became popular, enable accurate age prediction. We also show that internet writing characteristics are important features for age prediction, but that lexical content is also needed to produce significantly more accurate results. Our best results allow for 81.57% accuracy.</p><p>3 0.7646873 <a title="194-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-Extracting_Social_Power_Relationships_from_Natural_Language.html">133 acl-2011-Extracting Social Power Relationships from Natural Language</a></p>
<p>Author: Philip Bramsen ; Martha Escobar-Molano ; Ami Patel ; Rafael Alonso</p><p>Abstract: Sociolinguists have long argued that social context influences language use in all manner of ways, resulting in lects 1. This paper explores a text classification problem we will call lect modeling, an example of what has been termed computational sociolinguistics. In particular, we use machine learning techniques to identify social power relationships between members of a social network, based purely on the content of their interpersonal communication. We rely on statistical methods, as opposed to language-specific engineering, to extract features which represent vocabulary and grammar usage indicative of social power lect. We then apply support vector machines to model the social power lects representing superior-subordinate communication in the Enron email corpus. Our results validate the treatment of lect modeling as a text classification problem – albeit a hard one – and constitute a case for future research in computational sociolinguistics. 1</p><p>4 0.74977386 <a title="194-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Social_Network_Extraction_from_Texts%3A_A_Thesis_Proposal.html">286 acl-2011-Social Network Extraction from Texts: A Thesis Proposal</a></p>
<p>Author: Apoorv Agarwal</p><p>Abstract: In my thesis, Ipropose to build a system that would enable extraction of social interactions from texts. To date Ihave defined a comprehensive set of social events and built a preliminary system that extracts social events from news articles. Iplan to improve the performance of my current system by incorporating semantic information. Using domain adaptation techniques, Ipropose to apply my system to a wide range of genres. By extracting linguistic constructs relevant to social interactions, I will be able to empirically analyze different kinds of linguistic constructs that people use to express social interactions. Lastly, I will attempt to make convolution kernels more scalable and interpretable.</p><p>5 0.73288655 <a title="194-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Subjective_Natural_Language_Problems%3A_Motivations%2C_Applications%2C_Characterizations%2C_and_Implications.html">288 acl-2011-Subjective Natural Language Problems: Motivations, Applications, Characterizations, and Implications</a></p>

<p>Author: Ivan Titov</p><p>Abstract: We consider a semi-supervised setting for domain adaptation where only unlabeled data is available for the target domain. One way to tackle this problem is to train a generative model with latent variables on the mixture of data from the source and target domains. Such a model would cluster features in both domains and ensure that at least some of the latent variables are predictive of the label on the source domain. The danger is that these predictive clusters will consist of features specific to the source domain only and, consequently, a classifier relying on such clusters would perform badly on the target domain. We introduce a constraint enforcing that marginal distributions of each cluster (i.e., each latent variable) do not vary significantly across domains. We show that this constraint is effec- tive on the sentiment classification task (Pang et al., 2002), resulting in scores similar to the ones obtained by the structural correspondence methods (Blitzer et al., 2007) without the need to engineer auxiliary tasks.</p><p>3 0.62482566 <a title="194-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-EdIt%3A_A_Broad-Coverage_Grammar_Checker_Using_Pattern_Grammar.html">108 acl-2011-EdIt: A Broad-Coverage Grammar Checker Using Pattern Grammar</a></p>
<p>Author: Chung-chi Huang ; Mei-hua Chen ; Shih-ting Huang ; Jason S. Chang</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new method for learning to detect grammatical errors in learner’s writing and provide suggestions. The method involves parsing a reference corpus and inferring grammar patterns in the form of a sequence of content words, function words, and parts-of-speech (e.g., “play ~ role in Ving” and “look forward to Ving”). At runtime, the given passage submitted by the learner is matched using an extended Levenshtein algorithm against the set of pattern rules in order to detect errors and provide suggestions. We present a prototype implementation of the proposed method, EdIt, that can handle a broad range of errors. Promising results are illustrated with three common types of errors in nonnative writing. 1</p><p>4 0.59503233 <a title="194-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Reordering_Metrics_for_MT.html">264 acl-2011-Reordering Metrics for MT</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexandra Birch ; Miles Osborne</p><p>Abstract: One of the major challenges facing statistical machine translation is how to model differences in word order between languages. Although a great deal of research has focussed on this problem, progress is hampered by the lack of reliable metrics. Most current metrics are based on matching lexical items in the translation and the reference, and their ability to measure the quality of word order has not been demonstrated. This paper presents a novel metric, the LRscore, which explicitly measures the quality of word order by using permutation distance metrics. We show that the metric is more consistent with human judgements than other metrics, including the BLEU score. We also show that the LRscore can successfully be used as the objective function when training translation model parameters. Training with the LRscore leads to output which is preferred by humans. Moreover, the translations incur no penalty in terms of BLEU scores.</p><p>5 0.53290135 <a title="194-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Using_Multiple_Sources_to_Construct_a_Sentiment_Sensitive_Thesaurus_for_Cross-Domain_Sentiment_Classification.html">332 acl-2011-Using Multiple Sources to Construct a Sentiment Sensitive Thesaurus for Cross-Domain Sentiment Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Danushka Bollegala ; David Weir ; John Carroll</p><p>Abstract: We describe a sentiment classification method that is applicable when we do not have any labeled data for a target domain but have some labeled data for multiple other domains, designated as the source domains. We automat- ically create a sentiment sensitive thesaurus using both labeled and unlabeled data from multiple source domains to find the association between words that express similar sentiments in different domains. The created thesaurus is then used to expand feature vectors to train a binary classifier. Unlike previous cross-domain sentiment classification methods, our method can efficiently learn from multiple source domains. Our method significantly outperforms numerous baselines and returns results that are better than or comparable to previous cross-domain sentiment classification methods on a benchmark dataset containing Amazon user reviews for different types of products.</p><p>6 0.51995826 <a title="194-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Event_Discovery_in_Social_Media_Feeds.html">121 acl-2011-Event Discovery in Social Media Feeds</a></p>

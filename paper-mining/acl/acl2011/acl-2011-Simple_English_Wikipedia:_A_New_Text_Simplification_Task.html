<p>Author: Or Biran ; Samuel Brody ; Noemie Elhadad</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for lexical simplification. Simplification rules are learned from a comparable corpus, and the rules are applied in a context-aware fashion to input sentences. Our method is unsupervised. Furthermore, it does not require any alignment or correspondence among the complex and simple corpora. We evaluate the simplification according to three criteria: preservation of grammaticality, preservation of meaning, and degree of simplification. Results show that our method outperforms an established simplification baseline for both meaning preservation and simplification, while maintaining a high level of grammaticality.</p><p>3 0.30319056 <a title="283-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-How_Much_Can_We_Gain_from_Supervised_Word_Alignment%3F.html">152 acl-2011-How Much Can We Gain from Supervised Word Alignment?</a></p>
<p>Author: Jinxi Xu ; Jinying Chen</p><p>Abstract: Word alignment is a central problem in statistical machine translation (SMT). In recent years, supervised alignment algorithms, which improve alignment accuracy by mimicking human alignment, have attracted a great deal of attention. The objective of this work is to explore the performance limit of supervised alignment under the current SMT paradigm. Our experiments used a manually aligned ChineseEnglish corpus with 280K words recently released by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). We treated the human alignment as the oracle of supervised alignment. The result is surprising: the gain of human alignment over a state of the art unsupervised method (GIZA++) is less than 1point in BLEU. Furthermore, we showed the benefit of improved alignment becomes smaller with more training data, implying the above limit also holds for large training conditions. 1</p><p>4 0.2334404 <a title="283-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Wikipedia_Revision_Toolkit%3A_Efficiently_Accessing_Wikipedias_Edit_History.html">337 acl-2011-Wikipedia Revision Toolkit: Efficiently Accessing Wikipedias Edit History</a></p>
<p>Author: Oliver Ferschke ; Torsten Zesch ; Iryna Gurevych</p><p>Abstract: We present an open-source toolkit which allows (i) to reconstruct past states of Wikipedia, and (ii) to efficiently access the edit history of Wikipedia articles. Reconstructing past states of Wikipedia is a prerequisite for reproducing previous experimental work based on Wikipedia. Beyond that, the edit history of Wikipedia articles has been shown to be a valuable knowledge source for NLP, but access is severely impeded by the lack of efficient tools for managing the huge amount of provided data. By using a dedicated storage format, our toolkit massively decreases the data volume to less than 2% of the original size, and at the same time provides an easy-to-use interface to access the revision data. The language-independent design allows to process any language represented in Wikipedia. We expect this work to consolidate NLP research using Wikipedia in general, and to foster research making use of the knowledge encoded in Wikipediaâ€™s edit history.</p><p>5 0.21803467 <a title="283-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Bayesian_Word_Alignment_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">57 acl-2011-Bayesian Word Alignment for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Coskun Mermer ; Murat Saraclar</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we compare the translation performance of word alignments obtained via Bayesian inference to those obtained via expectation-maximization (EM). We propose a Gibbs sampler for fully Bayesian inference in IBM Model 1, integrating over all possible parameter values in finding the alignment distribution. We show that Bayesian inference outperforms EM in all of the tested language pairs, domains and data set sizes, by up to 2.99 BLEU points. We also show that the proposed method effectively addresses the well-known rare word problem in EM-estimated models; and at the same time induces a much smaller dictionary of bilingual word-pairs. .t r</p><p>6 0.21496263 <a title="283-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Rare_Word_Translation_Extraction_from_Aligned_Comparable_Documents.html">259 acl-2011-Rare Word Translation Extraction from Aligned Comparable Documents</a></p>

<p>Author: Manoj Harpalani ; Michael Hart ; Sandesh Signh ; Rob Johnson ; Yejin Choi</p><p>Abstract: Community-based knowledge forums, such as Wikipedia, are susceptible to vandalism, i.e., ill-intentioned contributions that are detrimental to the quality of collective intelligence. Most previous work to date relies on shallow lexico-syntactic patterns and metadata to automatically detect vandalism in Wikipedia. In this paper, we explore more linguistically motivated approaches to vandalism detection. In particular, we hypothesize that textual vandalism constitutes a unique genre where a group of people share a similar linguistic behavior. Experimental results suggest that (1) statistical models give evidence to unique language styles in vandalism, and that (2) deep syntactic patterns based on probabilistic context free grammars (PCFG) discriminate vandalism more effectively than shallow lexicosyntactic patterns based on n-grams. ,</p><p>5 0.6476019 <a title="283-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-How_Much_Can_We_Gain_from_Supervised_Word_Alignment%3F.html">152 acl-2011-How Much Can We Gain from Supervised Word Alignment?</a></p>

<p>Author: Chi-kiu Lo ; Dekai Wu</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel semi-automated metric, MEANT, that assesses translation utility by matching semantic role fillers, producing scores that correlate with human judgment as well as HTER but at much lower labor cost. As machine translation systems improve in lexical choice and fluency, the shortcomings of widespread n-gram based, fluency-oriented MT evaluation metrics such as BLEU, which fail to properly evaluate adequacy, become more apparent. But more accurate, nonautomatic adequacy-oriented MT evaluation metrics like HTER are highly labor-intensive, which bottlenecks the evaluation cycle. We first show that when using untrained monolingual readers to annotate semantic roles in MT output, the non-automatic version of the metric HMEANT achieves a 0.43 correlation coefficient with human adequacyjudgments at the sentence level, far superior to BLEU at only 0.20, and equal to the far more expensive HTER. We then replace the human semantic role annotators with automatic shallow semantic parsing to further automate the evaluation metric, and show that even the semiautomated evaluation metric achieves a 0.34 correlation coefficient with human adequacy judgment, which is still about 80% as closely correlated as HTER despite an even lower labor cost for the evaluation procedure. The results show that our proposed metric is significantly better correlated with human judgment on adequacy than current widespread automatic evaluation metrics, while being much more cost effective than HTER. 1</p><p>3 0.89829296 <a title="283-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Learning_to_Grade_Short_Answer_Questions_using_Semantic_Similarity_Measures_and_Dependency_Graph_Alignments.html">205 acl-2011-Learning to Grade Short Answer Questions using Semantic Similarity Measures and Dependency Graph Alignments</a></p>

<p>Author: Dmitriy Dligach ; Martha Palmer</p><p>Abstract: Active Learning (AL) is typically initialized with a small seed of examples selected randomly. However, when the distribution of classes in the data is skewed, some classes may be missed, resulting in a slow learning progress. Our contribution is twofold: (1) we show that an unsupervised language modeling based technique is effective in selecting rare class examples, and (2) we use this technique for seeding AL and demonstrate that it leads to a higher learning rate. The evaluation is conducted in the context of word sense disambiguation.</p><p>6 0.87097293 <a title="283-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Combining_Indicators_of_Allophony.html">74 acl-2011-Combining Indicators of Allophony</a></p>

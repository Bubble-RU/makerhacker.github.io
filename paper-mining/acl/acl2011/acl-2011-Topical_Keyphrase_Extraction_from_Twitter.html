<p>Author: Zhonghua Qu ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: The number of users on Twitter has drastically increased in the past years. However, Twitter does not have an effective user grouping mechanism. Therefore tweets from other users can quickly overrun and become inconvenient to read. In this paper, we propose methods to help users group the people they follow using their provided seeding users. Two sources of information are used to build sub-systems: textural information captured by the tweets sent by users, and social connections among users. We also propose a measure of fitness to determine which subsystem best represents the seed users and use it for target user ranking. Our experiments show that our proposed framework works well and that adaptively choosing the appropriate sub-system for group suggestion results in increased accuracy.</p><p>3 0.16218452 <a title="305-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Part-of-Speech_Tagging_for_Twitter%3A_Annotation%2C_Features%2C_and_Experiments.html">242 acl-2011-Part-of-Speech Tagging for Twitter: Annotation, Features, and Experiments</a></p>

<p>Author: Long Jiang ; Mo Yu ; Ming Zhou ; Xiaohua Liu ; Tiejun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: Sentiment analysis on Twitter data has attracted much attention recently. In this paper, we focus on target-dependent Twitter sentiment classification; namely, given a query, we classify the sentiments of the tweets as positive, negative or neutral according to whether they contain positive, negative or neutral sentiments about that query. Here the query serves as the target of the sentiments. The state-ofthe-art approaches for solving this problem always adopt the target-independent strategy, which may assign irrelevant sentiments to the given target. Moreover, the state-of-the-art approaches only take the tweet to be classified into consideration when classifying the sentiment; they ignore its context (i.e., related tweets). However, because tweets are usually short and more ambiguous, sometimes it is not enough to consider only the current tweet for sentiment classification. In this paper, we propose to improve target-dependent Twitter sentiment classification by 1) incorporating target-dependent features; and 2) taking related tweets into consideration. According to the experimental results, our approach greatly improves the performance of target-dependent sentiment classification. 1</p><p>6 0.13658832 <a title="305-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Wikulu%3A_An_Extensible_Architecture_for_Integrating_Natural_Language_Processing_Techniques_with_Wikis.html">338 acl-2011-Wikulu: An Extensible Architecture for Integrating Natural Language Processing Techniques with Wikis</a></p>

We report on a method for constructing a corpus of sarcastic Twitter messages in which determination of the sarcasm of each message has been made by its author. We use this reliable corpus to compare sarcastic utterances in Twitter to utterances that express positive or negative attitudes without sarcasm. We investigate the impact of lexical and pragmatic factors on machine learning effectiveness for identifying sarcastic utterances and we compare the performance of machine learning techniques and human judges on this task. Perhaps unsurprisingly, neither the human judges nor the machine learning techniques perform very well. 1</p><p>4 0.61766362 <a title="305-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-C-Feel-It%3A_A_Sentiment_Analyzer_for_Micro-blogs.html">64 acl-2011-C-Feel-It: A Sentiment Analyzer for Micro-blogs</a></p>

<p>Author: Manoj Harpalani ; Michael Hart ; Sandesh Signh ; Rob Johnson ; Yejin Choi</p><p>Abstract: Community-based knowledge forums, such as Wikipedia, are susceptible to vandalism, i.e., ill-intentioned contributions that are detrimental to the quality of collective intelligence. Most previous work to date relies on shallow lexico-syntactic patterns and metadata to automatically detect vandalism in Wikipedia. In this paper, we explore more linguistically motivated approaches to vandalism detection. In particular, we hypothesize that textual vandalism constitutes a unique genre where a group of people share a similar linguistic behavior. Experimental results suggest that (1) statistical models give evidence to unique language styles in vandalism, and that (2) deep syntactic patterns based on probabilistic context free grammars (PCFG) discriminate vandalism more effectively than shallow lexicosyntactic patterns based on n-grams. ,</p><p>3 0.56586796 <a title="305-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Clairlib%3A_A_Toolkit_for_Natural_Language_Processing%2C_Information_Retrieval%2C_and_Network_Analysis.html">67 acl-2011-Clairlib: A Toolkit for Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Network Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Renxian Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In summarization, sentence ordering is conducted to enhance summary readability by accommodating text coherence. We propose a grouping-based ordering framework that integrates local and global coherence concerns. Summary sentences are grouped before ordering is applied on two levels: group-level and sentence-level. Different algorithms for grouping and ordering are discussed. The preliminary results on single-document news datasets demonstrate the advantage of our method over a widely accepted method. 1 Introduction and Background The canonical pipeline of text summarization consists of topic identification, interpretation, and summary generation (Hovy, 2005). In the simple case of extraction, topic identification and interpretation are conflated to sentence selection and concerned with summary informativeness. In . comparison, summary generation addresses summary readability and a frequently discussed generation technique is sentence ordering. It is implicitly or explicitly stated that sentence ordering for summarization is primarily driven by coherence. For example, Barzilay et al. (2002) use lexical cohesion information to model local coherence. A statistical model by Lapata (2003) considers both lexical and syntactic features in calculating local coherence. More globally biased is Barzilay and Lee’s (2004) HMM-based content model, which models global coherence with word distribution patterns. Whilst the above models treat coherence as lexical or topical relations, Barzilay and Lapata (2005, 2008) explicitly model local coherence with an entity grid model trained for optimal syntactic role transitions of entities. 6 . polyu .edu .hk Although coherence in those works is modeled in the guise of “lexical cohesion”, “topic closeness”, “content relatedness”, etc., few published works simultaneously accommodate coherence on the two levels: local coherence and global coherence, both of which are intriguing topics in text linguistics and psychology. For sentences, local coherence means the wellconnectedness between adjacent sentences through lexical cohesion (Halliday and Hasan, 1976) or entity repetition (Grosz et al., 1995) and global coherence is the discourse-level relation connecting remote sentences (Mann and Thompson, 1995; Kehler, 2002). An abundance of psychological evidences show that coherence on both levels is manifested in text comprehension (Tapiero, 2007). Accordingly, an apt sentence ordering scheme should be driven by such concerns. We also note that as sentence ordering is usually discussed only in the context of multi-document summarization, factors other than coherence are also considered, such as time and source sentence position in Bollegala et al.’s (2006) “agglomerative ordering” approach. But it remains an open question whether sentence ordering is non-trivial for single-document summarization, as it has long been recognized as an actual strategy taken by human summarizers (Jing, 1998; Jing and McKeown, 2000) and acknowledged early in work on sentence ordering for multi-document summarization (Barzilay et al., 2002). In this paper, we outline a grouping-based sentence ordering framework that is driven by the concern of local and global coherence. Summary sentences are grouped according to their conceptual relatedness before being ordered on two levels: group-level ordering and sentence-level ordering, which capture global coherence and local coherence in an integrated model. As a preliminary study, we applied the framework to singlePortland, ORP,r UoSceAed 1i9ng-2s4 of Ju tnhee 2 A0C1L1-H. ?Lc T2 0201111 A Ssstuodcieanttio Snes fsoiro Cn,o pmapguesta 6t–io1n1a,l Linguistics document summary generation and obtained interesting results. The main contributions of this work are: (1) we stress the need to channel sentence ordering research to linguistic and psychological findings about text coherence; (2) we propose a groupingbased ordering framework that integrates both local and global coherence; (3) we find in experiments that coherence-driven sentence ordering improves the readability of singledocument summaries, for which sentence ordering is often considered trivial. In Section 2, we review related ideas and techniques in previous work. Section 3 provides the details of grouping-based sentence ordering. The preliminary experimental results are presented in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes the whole paper and describes future work. 2 Grouping-Based Ordering Our ordering framework is designed to capture both local and global coherence. Globally, we identify related groups among sentences and find their relative order. Locally, we strive to keep sentence similar or related in content close to each other within one group. 2.1 Sentence Representation As summary sentences are isolated from their original context, we retain the important content information by representing sentences as concept vectors. In the simplest case, the “concept” is equivalent to content word. A drawback of this practice is that it considers every content word equally contributive to the sentence content, which is not always true. For example, in the news domain, entities realized as NPs are more important than other concepts. To represent sentences as entity vectors, we identify both common entities (as the head nouns of NPs) and named entities. Two common entities are equivalent if their noun stems are identical or synonymous. Named entities are usually equated by identity. But in order to improve accuracy, we also consider: 1) structural subsumption (one is part of another); 2) hypernymy and holonymy (the named entities are in a superordinate-subordinate or part-whole relation). Now with summary sentence Si and m entities eik (k = 1 m), Si = (wf(ei1), wf(ei2), wf(eim)), … … … … … …, 7 where wf(eik) = wk× ×f(eik), f(eik) is the frequency of eik and wk is the weight of eik. We define wk = 1 if eik is a common entity and wk = 2 if eik is a named entity. We give double weight to named entities because of their significance to news articles. After all, a news story typically contains events, places, organizations, people, etc. that denote the news theme. Other things being equal, two sentences sharing a mention of named entities are thematically closer than two sentences sharing a mention of common entities. Alternatively, we can realize the “concept” as “event” because events are prevalent semantic constructs that bear much of the sentence content in some domains (e.g., narratives and news reports). To represent sentences as event vectors, we can follow Zhang et al.’s (2010) method at the cost of more complexity. 2.2 Sentence Grouping To meet the global need of identifying sentence groups, we develop two grouping algorithms by applying graph-based operation and clustering. Connected Component Finding (CC) This algorithm treats grouping sentences as finding connected components (CC) in a text graph TG = (V, E), where V represents the sentences and E the sentence relations weighted by cosine similarity. Edges with weight < t, a threshold, are removed because they represent poor sentence coherence. The resultant graph may be disconnected, in which we find all of its connected components, using depth-first search. The connected components are the groups we are looking for. Note that this method cannot guarantee that every two sentences in such a group are directly linked, but it does guarantee that there exists a path between every sentence pair. Modified K-means Clustering (MKM) Observing that the CC method finds only coherent groups, not necessarily groups of coherent sentences, we develop a second algorithm using clustering. A good choice might be K-means as it is efficient and outperforms agglomerative clustering methods in NLP applications (Steibach et al., 2000), but the difficulty with the conventional K-means is the decision of K. Our solution is modified K-means (MKM) based on (Wilpon and Rabiner, 1985). Let’s denote cluster iby CLi and cluster similarity by Sim(CLi) =SimM,SiinnCLi(Sim( Sim,Sin)), where Sim( Sim,Sin)is their cvMeluin231st.(roCWSD21imLsdhtoIf(=ClaSehbLsimt)l1;(zehS<-amncs,tdoeSa1vn)c;st:el=uMionvrate(lhcSKiosmg-tC;eblLayn)s,c2riuegant wcoelsunathdi cosine. The following illustrates the algorithm. The above algorithm stops iterating when each cluster contains all above-threshold-similarity sentence pairs or only one sentence. Unlike CC, MKM results in more strongly connected groups, or groups of coherence sentences. 2.3 Ordering Algorithms After the sentences are grouped, ordering is to be conducted on two levels: group and sentence. Composed of closely related sentences, groups simulate high-level textual constructs, such as “central event”, “cause”, “effect”, “background”, etc. for news articles, around which sentences are generated for global coherence. For an intuitive example, all sentences about “cause” should immediately precede all sentences about “effect” to achieve optimal readability. We propose two approaches to group-level ordering. 1) If the group sentences come from the same document, group (Gi) order is decided by the group-representing sentence (gi) order ( means “precede”) in the text. gi gj  Gi Gj 2) Group order is decided in a greedy fashion in order to maximize the connectedness between adjacent groups, thus enhancing local coherence. Each time a group is selected to achieve maximum similarity with the ordered groups and the first ordered group (G1) is selected to achieve maximum similarity with all the other groups. G1argmGaxG'GSim( G , G') GiGuanrogrdemred agrxoupsij1 Sim( Gj, G) (i > 1) where Sim(G, G’) is the average sentence cosine similarity between G and G’. 8 Within the ordered groups, sentence-level ordering is aimed to enhance local coherence by placing conceptually close sentences next to each other. Similarly, we propose two approaches. 1) If the sentences come from the same document, they are arranged by the text order. 2) Sentence order is greedily decided.

But there is no theoretical proof that it leads to optimal global and local coherence that concerns us. On some occasions, e.g., a news article adopting the “Wall Street Journal Formula” (Rich and Harper, 2007) where conceptually related sentences are placed at the beginning and the end, sentence conceptual relatedness does not necessarily correlate with spatial proximity and thus selected sentences may need to be rearranged for better readability. We are not aware of any published work that has empirically compared alternative ways of sentence ordering for singledocument summarization. The experimental results reported below may draw some attention to this taken-for-granted issue. 3.1 Data and Method We prepared 3 datasets of 60 documents each, the first (D400) consisting of documents of about 400 words from the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) 01/02 datasets; the second (D1k) consisting of documents of about 1000 words manually selected from popular English journals such as The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, etc; the third (D2k) consisting of documents of about 2000 words from the DUC 01/02 dataset. Then we generated 100-word summaries for D400 and 200-word summaries for D1k and D2k. Since sentence selection is not our focus, the 180 summaries were all extracts produced by a simple but robust summarizer built on term frequency and sentence position (Aone et al., 1999). Three human annotators were employed to each provide reference orderings for the 180 summaries and mark paragraph (of at least 2 sentences) boundaries, which will be used by one of the evaluation metrics described below. In our implementation of the grouping-based ordering, sentences are represented as entity vectors and the threshold t = Avg( Sim( Sm, Sn))  c , the average sentence similarity in a group multiplied by a coefficient empirically decided on separate held-out datasets of 20 documents for each length category. The “group-representing sentence” is the textually earliest sentence in the group. We experimented with both CC and MKM to generate sentence groups and all the proposed algorithms in 2.3 for group-level and sentence- level orderings, resulting in 8 combinations as test orderings, each coded in the format of “Grouping (CC/MKM) / Group ordering (T/G) / Sentence ordering (T/G)”, where T and G represent the text order approach and the greedy selection approach respectively. For example, “CC/T/G” means grouping with CC, group ordering with text order, and sentence ordering with the greedy approach. We evaluated the test orderings against the 3 reference orderings and compute the average (Madnani et al., 2007) by using 3 different metrics. The first metric is Kendall’s τ (Lapata 2003, 2006), which has been reliably used in ordering evaluations (Bollegala et al., 2006; Madnani et al., 2007). It measures ordering differences in terms of the number of adjacent sentence inversions necessary to convert a test ordering to the reference ordering.   1 4m N( N 1) In this formula, m represents the number of inversions described above and N is the total number of sentences. The second metric is the Average Continuity (AC) proposed by Bollegala et al. (2006), which captures the intuition that the quality of sentence orderings can be estimated by the number of correctly arranged continuous sentences. 9 ACexp(1/(k1) klog(Pn)) n2 In this formula, k is the maximum number of continuous sentences, α is a small value in case Pn = 1. Pn, the proportion of continuous sentences of length n in an ordering, is defined as m/(N – n + 1) where m is the number of continuous sentences of length n in both the test and reference orderings and N is the total number of sentences. Following (Bollegala et al., 2006), we set k = Min(4, N) and α = 0.01. We also go a step further by considering only the continuous sentences in a paragraph marked by human annotators, because paragraphs are local meaning units perceived by human readers and the order of continuous sentences in a paragraph is more strongly grounded than the order of continuous sentences across paragraph boundaries. So in-paragraph sentence continuity is a better estimation for the quality of sentence orderings. This is our third metric: Paragraph-level Average Continuity (P-AC). P-ACexp(1/(k1) klog(PPn )) n2 Here PPn = m ’/(N – n + 1), where m ’ is the number of continuous sentences of length n in both the test ordering and a paragraph of the reference ordering. All the other parameters are as defined in AC and Pn. 3.2 Results The following tables show the results measured by each metric. For comparison, we also include a “Baseline” that uses the text order. For each dataset, two-tailed t-test is conducted between the top scorer and all the other orderings and statistical significance (p < 0.05) is marked with *. In general, our grouping-based ordering scheme outperforms the baseline for news articles of various lengths and statistically significant improvement can be observed on each dataset. This result casts serious doubt on the widely accepted practice of taking the text order for single-document summary generation, which is a major finding from our study. The three evaluation metrics give consistent results although they are based on different observations. The P-AC scores are much lower than their AC counterparts because of its strict paragraph constraint. Interestingly, applying the text order posterior to sentence grouping for group-level and sentence- level ordering leads to consistently optimal performance, as the top scorers on each dataset are almost all “__/T/T”. This suggests that the textual realization of coherence can be sought in the source document if possible, after the selected sentences are rearranged. It is in this sense that the general intuition about the text order is justified. It also suggests that tightly knit paragraphs (groups), where the sentences are closely connected, play a crucial role in creating a coherence flow. Shuffling those paragraphs may not affect the final coherence1. 1 Ithank an anonymous reviewer for pointing this out. 10 The grouping method does make a difference. While CC works best for the short and long datasets (D400 and D2k), MKM is more effective for the medium-sized dataset D1k. Whether the difference is simply due to length or linguistic/stylistic subtleties is an interesting topic for in-depth study. 4 Conclusion and Future Work We have established a grouping-based ordering scheme to accommodate both local and global coherence for summary generation. Experiments on single-document summaries validate our approach and challenge the well accepted text order by the summarization community. Nonetheless, the results do not necessarily propagate to multi-document summarization, for which the same-document clue for ordering cannot apply directly. Adapting the proposed scheme to multi-document summary generation is the ongoing work we are engaged in. In the next step, we will experiment with alternative sentence representations and ordering algorithms to achieve better performance. We are also considering adapting more sophisticated coherence-oriented models, such as (Soricut and Marcu, 2006; Elsner et al., 2007), to our problem so as to make more interesting comparisons possible.

<p>Author: Zhongguo Li</p><p>Abstract: Lots of Chinese characters are very productive in that they can form many structured words either as prefixes or as suffixes. Previous research in Chinese word segmentation mainly focused on identifying only the word boundaries without considering the rich internal structures of many words. In this paper we argue that this is unsatisfying in many ways, both practically and theoretically. Instead, we propose that word structures should be recovered in morphological analysis. An elegant approach for doing this is given and the result is shown to be promising enough for encouraging further effort in this direction. Our probability model is trained with the Penn Chinese Treebank and actually is able to parse both word and phrase structures in a unified way. 1 Why Parse Word Structures? Research in Chinese word segmentation has progressed tremendously in recent years, with state of the art performing at around 97% in precision and recall (Xue, 2003; Gao et al., 2005; Zhang and Clark, 2007; Li and Sun, 2009). However, virtually all these systems focus exclusively on recognizing the word boundaries, giving no consideration to the internal structures of many words. Though it has been the standard practice for many years, we argue that this paradigm is inadequate both in theory and in practice, for at least the following four reasons. The first reason is that if we confine our definition of word segmentation to the identification of word boundaries, then people tend to have divergent 1405 opinions as to whether a linguistic unit is a word or not (Sproat et al., 1996). This has led to many different annotation standards for Chinese word segmentation. Even worse, this could cause inconsistency in the same corpus. For instance, 䉂 擌 奒 ‘vice president’ is considered to be one word in the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005), but is split into two words by the Peking University corpus in the SIGHAN Bakeoffs (Sproat and Emerson, 2003). Meanwhile, 䉂 䀓 惼 ‘vice director’ and 䉂 䚲䡮 ‘deputy are both segmented into two words in the same Penn Chinese Treebank. In fact, all these words are composed of the prefix 䉂 ‘vice’ and a root word. Thus the structure of 䉂擌奒 ‘vice president’ can be represented with the tree in Figure 1. Without a doubt, there is complete agree- manager’ NN ,,ll JJf NNf 䉂 擌奒 Figure 1: Example of a word with internal structure. ment on the correctness of this structure among native Chinese speakers. So if instead of annotating only word boundaries, we annotate the structures of every word, then the annotation tends to be more 1 1Here it is necessary to add a note on terminology used in this paper. Since there is no universally accepted definition of the “word” concept in linguistics and especially in Chinese, whenever we use the term “word” we might mean a linguistic unit such as 䉂 擌奒 ‘vice president’ whose structure is shown as the tree in Figure 1, or we might mean a smaller unit such as 擌奒 ‘president’ which is a substructure of that tree. Hopefully, ProceedingPso orftla thned 4,9 Otrhe Agonnn,u Jauln Mee 1e9t-i2ng4, o 2f0 t1h1e.

The second reason is applications have different requirements for granularity of words. Take the personal name 撱 嗤吼 ‘Zhou Shuren’ as an example. It’s considered to be one word in the Penn Chinese Treebank, but is segmented into a surname and a given name in the Peking University corpus. For some applications such as information extraction, the former segmentation is adequate, while for others like machine translation, the later finer-grained output is more preferable. If the analyzer can produce a structure as shown in Figure 4(a), then every application can extract what it needs from this tree. A solution with tree output like this is more elegant than approaches which try to meet the needs of different applications in post-processing (Gao et al., 2004). The third reason is that traditional word segmentation has problems in handling many phenomena in Chinese. For example, the telescopic compound 㦌 撥 怂惆 ‘universities, middle schools and primary schools’ is in fact composed ofthree coordinating elements 㦌惆 ‘university’, 撥 惆 ‘middle school’ and 怂惆 ‘primary school’ . Regarding it as one flat word loses this important information. Another example is separable words like 扩 扙 ‘swim’ . With a linear segmentation, the meaning of ‘swimming’ as in 扩 堑 扙 ‘after swimming’ cannot be properly represented, since 扩扙 ‘swim’ will be segmented into discontinuous units. These language usages lie at the boundary between syntax and morphology, and are not uncommon in Chinese. They can be adequately represented with trees (Figure 2).

The last reason why we should care about word the context will always make it clear what is being referred to with the term “word”. 1406 structures is related to head driven statistical parsers (Collins, 2003). To illustrate this, note that in the Penn Chinese Treebank, the word 戽 䊂䠽 吼 ‘English People’ does not occur at all. Hence constituents headed by such words could cause some difficulty for head driven models in which out-ofvocabulary words need to be treated specially both when they are generated and when they are conditioned upon. But this word is in turn headed by its suffix 吼 ‘people’, and there are 2,233 such words in Penn Chinese Treebank. If we annotate the structure of every compound containing this suffix (e.g. Figure 3), such data sparsity simply goes away.</p><p>6 0.47153854 <a title="305-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Hypothesis_Mixture_Decoding_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">155 acl-2011-Hypothesis Mixture Decoding for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

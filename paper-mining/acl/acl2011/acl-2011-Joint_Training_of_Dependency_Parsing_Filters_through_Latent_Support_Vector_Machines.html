<p>Author: Brian Roark ; Richard Sproat ; Izhak Shafran</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce a novel use of the lexicographic semiring and motivate its use for speech and language processing tasks. We prove that the semiring allows for exact encoding of backoff models with epsilon transitions. This allows for off-line optimization of exact models represented as large weighted finite-state transducers in contrast to implicit (on-line) failure transition representations. We present preliminary empirical results demonstrating that, even in simple intersection scenarios amenable to the use of failure transitions, the use of the more powerful lexicographic semiring is competitive in terms of time of intersection. 1 Introduction and Motivation Representing smoothed n-gram language models as weighted finite-state transducers (WFST) is most naturally done with a failure transition, which reflects the semantics of the “otherwise” formulation of smoothing (Allauzen et al., 2003). For example, the typical backoff formulation of the probability of a word w given a history h is as follows P(w | h) = ?αPh(Pw( |w h )| h0) oift hc(ehrwwis)e > 0 (1) where P is an empirical estimate of the probability that reserves small finite probability for unseen n-grams; αh is a backoff weight that ensures normalization; and h0 is a backoff history typically achieved by excising the earliest word in the history h. The principle benefit of encoding the WFST in this way is that it only requires explicitly storing n-gram transitions for observed n-grams, i.e., count greater than zero, as opposed to all possible n-grams of the given order which would be infeasible in for example large vocabulary speech recognition. This is a massive space savings, and such an approach is also used for non-probabilistic stochastic language 1 models, such as those trained with the perceptron algorithm (Roark et al., 2007), as the means to access all and exactly those features that should fire for a particular sequence in a deterministic automaton. Similar issues hold for other finite-state se- quence processing problems, e.g., tagging, bracketing or segmenting. Failure transitions, however, are an implicit method for representing a much larger explicit automaton in the case of n-gram models, all possible n-grams for that order. During composition with the model, the failure transition must be interpreted on the fly, keeping track of those symbols that have already been found leaving the original state, and only allowing failure transition traversal for symbols that have not been found (the semantics of “otherwise”). This compact implicit representation cannot generally be preserved when composing with other models, e.g., when combining a language model with a pronunciation lexicon as in widelyused FST approaches to speech recognition (Mohri et al., 2002). Moving from implicit to explicit representation when performing such a composition leads to an explosion in the size of the resulting transducer, frequently making the approach intractable. In practice, an off-line approximation to the model is made, typically by treating the failure transitions as epsilon transitions (Mohri et al., 2002; Allauzen et al., 2003), allowing large transducers to be composed and optimized off-line. These complex approximate transducers are then used during first-pass – decoding, and the resulting pruned search graphs (e.g., word lattices) can be rescored with exact language models encoded with failure transitions. Similar problems arise when building, say, POStaggers as WFST: not every pos-tag sequence will have been observed during training, hence failure transitions will achieve great savings in the size of models. Yet discriminative models may include complex features that combine both input stream (word) and output stream (tag) sequences in a single feature, yielding complicated transducer topologies for which effective use of failure transitions may not Proceedings Pofo trhtlea 4nd9,th O Arnegnouna,l J Muneeet 1in9g-2 o4f, t 2h0e1 A1s.s ?oc ci2a0t1io1n A fosrso Ccioamtiopnut faotrio Cnoaml Lpiuntgauti osntiacls: Lsihnogrutpisatipcesrs, pages 1–5, be possible. An exact encoding using other mechanisms is required in such cases to allow for off-line representation and optimization. In this paper, we introduce a novel use of a semiring the lexicographic semiring (Golan, 1999) which permits an exact encoding of these sorts of models with the same compact topology as with failure transitions, but using epsilon transitions. Unlike the standard epsilon approximation, this semiring allows for an exact representation, while also allowing (unlike failure transition approaches) for off-line – – composition with other transducers, with all the optimizations that such representations provide. In the next section, we introduce the semiring, followed by a proof that its use yields exact representations. We then conclude with a brief evaluation of the cost of intersection relative to failure transitions in comparable situations. 2 The Lexicographic Semiring Weighted automata are automata in which the transitions carry weight elements of a semiring (Kuich and Salomaa, 1986). A semiring is a ring that may lack negation, with two associative operations ⊕ and ⊗lac akn nde tghaetiiro nre,ws piethcti twveo i dasesnotictiya ievleem oepnertas t 0io annsd ⊕ ⊕ 1. a nAd ⊗com anmdo tnh esierm reirsipnegc tiivn es pideeenchti ayn edl elmanegnutasg 0e processing, and one that we will be using in this paper, is the tropical semiring (R ∪ {∞}, min, +, ∞, 0), i.e., tmhein t riosp tihcea l⊕ s omfi trhineg gs(e mRi∪rin{g∞ (w},imthi nid,e+nt,i∞ty ,∞0)), ia.end., m+ ins tihse t ⊗e o⊕f othfe t hseem seirminigri n(wg i(wth tidhe indteitnyt t0y). ∞Th)i asn ids a+pp isro thpreia ⊗te o ofof rth h pee srfeomrmiri nngg (Vwitietrhb iid seenatricthy u0s).in Tgh negative log probabilities – we add negative logs along a path and take the min between paths.

Each state in the automaton represents an n-gram history string h and each n-gram arc is weighted with the (negative log) conditional probability of the word w labeling the arc given the history h. For a given history h and n-gram arc labeled with a word w, the destination of the arc is the state associated with the longest suffix of the string hw that is a history in the model. This will depend on the Markov order of the n-gram model. For example, consider the trigram model schematic shown in Figure 1, in which only history sequences of length 2 are kept in the model. Thus, from history hi = wi−2wi−1, the word wi transitions to hi+1 = wi−1wi, w2hii−ch1 is the longest suffix of hiwi in the modie−l1. As detailed in the “otherwise” semantics of equation 1, backoff arcs transition from state h to a state h0, typically the suffix of h of length |h| − 1, with we,i tgyhpti c(a−lllyog th αeh s)u.

Backoff states of order k may be traversed either via φ-arcs from the higher order n-gram of order k + 1or via an n-gram arc from a lower order n-gram of order k −1.

We prove this by induction on the state-sequence of the path p/p0 up to a given state si/si0 in the respective machines M/M0. Base case: If p/p0 is of length 0, and therefore the states si/si0 are the initial states of the respective machines, the proposition clearly holds. Inductive step: Now suppose that p/p0 visits s0...si/s00...si0 and we have therefore reached si/si0 in the respective machines. Suppose the cumulated weights of p/p0 are W and hΨ, Wi, respectively. We wish to show thaarte w Whic anhedv heΨr sj isi n reexspt evcitsiivteedly o. nW p (i.e., the path becomes s0...sisj) the equivalent state s0 is visited on p0 (i.e., the path becomes s00...si0s0j). Let w be the next symbol to be matched leaving states si and si0. There are four cases to consider: (1) there is an n-gram arc leaving states si and si0 labeled with w, but no backoff arc leaving the state; (2) there is no n-gram arc labeled with w leaving the states, but there is a backoff arc; (3) there is no ngram arc labeled with w and no backoff arc leaving the states; and (4) there is both an n-gram arc labeled with w and a backoff arc leaving the states. In cases (1) and (2), there is only one possible transition to take in either M or M0, and based on the algorithm for construction of M0 given in Section 3.2, these transitions will point to sj and s0j respectively. Case (3) leads to failure of intersection with either machine. This leaves case (4) to consider. In M, since there is a transition leaving state si labeled with w, the backoff arc, which is a failure transition, cannot be traversed, hence the destination of the n-gram arc sj will be the next state in p. However, in M0, both the n-gram transition labeled with w and the backoff transition, now labeled with ?, can be traversed. What we will now prove is that the shortest path through M0 cannot include taking the backoff arc in this case. In order to emit w by taking the backoff arc out of state si0, one or more backoff (?) transitions must be taken, followed by an n-gram arc labeled with w. Let k be the order of the history represented by state si0, hence the cost of the first backoff arc is h(n − k)Φ, −log(αsi0 )i in our semiring. If we tirsa vhe(rns e− km) Φ b,a−ckloofgf( αarcs) ip irnior o tro eemmiitrtiinngg. the w, the first dimension of our accumulated cost will be m(n −k + m−21)Φ, based on our algorithm for consmtr(unct−ionk +of M0 given in Section 3.2. Let sl0 be the destination state after traversing m backoff arcs followed by an n-gram arc labeled with w. Note that, by definition, m ≤ k, and k − m + 1 is the orbdeyr oeffi nstitaitoen ,sl0 m. B≤ as ked, onnd t khe − c mons +tru 1ct iiosn t ealg oor-rithm, the state sl0 is also reachable by first emitting w from state si0 to reach state s0j followed by some number of backoff transitions. The order of state s0j is either k (if k is the highest order in the model) or k + 1 (by extending the history of state si0 by one word). If it is of order k, then it will require m −1 backoff arcs to reach state sl0, one fewer tqhuainre t mhe− −pa1t hb ctok osftfat aer ss0l oth raeta cbheg sitanste w sith a backoff arc, for a total cost of (m − 1) (n − k + m−21)Φ which is less than m(n − k + m−21)Φ.

The lexicographic semiring was evaluated on the development 4 set (2.6 hours of broadcast news and conversations; 18K words). The 888 word lattices for the development set were generated using a competitive baseline system with acoustic models trained on about 1000 hrs of Arabic broadcast data and a 4-gram language model. The language model consisting of 122M n-grams was estimated by interpolation of 14 components. The vocabulary is relatively large at 737K and the associated dictionary has only single pronunciations. The language model was converted to the automaton topology described earlier, and represented in three ways: first as an approximation of a failure machine using epsilons instead of failure arcs; second as a correct failure machine; and third using the lexicographic construction derived in this paper. The three versions of the LM were evaluated by intersecting them with the 888 lattices of the development set. The overall error rate for the systems was 24.8%—comparable to the state-of-theart on this task1 . For the shortest paths, the failure and lexicographic machines always produced identical lattices (as determined by FST equivalence); in contrast, 81% of the shortest paths from the epsilon approximation are different, at least in terms of weights, from the shortest paths using the failure LM. For full lattices, 42 (4.7%) of the lexicographic outputs differ from the failure LM outputs, due to small floating point rounding issues; 863 (97%) of the epsilon approximation outputs differ. In terms of size, the failure LM, with 5.7 million arcs requires 97 Mb.

The 1The error rate is a couple of points higher than in Lehr and Shafran (2011) since we discarded non-lexical words, which are absent in maximum likelihood estimated language model and are typically augmented to the unigram backoff state with an arbitrary cost, fine-tuned to optimize performance for a given task. 2If size became an issue, the first dimension of the hT, TiweigIhft scizane bbee c raemprees aennt iesdsu eby, tah esi fnigrlste bdyimtee. slightly slower speeds for the exact method using the failure LM, and hT, Ti can be related to the overhfaeialdur eof L cMom, apnudtin hgT ,tThei f caailnur bee f urenlcattieodn aot rhuen toivmeer,and determinization, respectively. 6 Conclusion In this paper we have introduced a novel application of the lexicographic semiring, proved that it can be used to provide an exact encoding of language model topologies with failure arcs, and provided experimental results that demonstrate its efficiency.

<p>Author: Y. Albert Park ; Roger Levy</p><p>Abstract: Automated grammar correction techniques have seen improvement over the years, but there is still much room for increased performance. Current correction techniques mainly focus on identifying and correcting a specific type of error, such as verb form misuse or preposition misuse, which restricts the corrections to a limited scope. We introduce a novel technique, based on a noisy channel model, which can utilize the whole sentence context to determine proper corrections. We show how to use the EM algorithm to learn the parameters of the noise model, using only a data set of erroneous sentences, given the proper language model. This frees us from the burden of acquiring a large corpora of corrected sentences. We also present a cheap and efficient way to provide automated evaluation re- sults for grammar corrections by using BLEU and METEOR, in contrast to the commonly used manual evaluations.</p><p>5 0.12482716 <a title="186-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-An_Ensemble_Model_that_Combines_Syntactic_and_Semantic_Clustering_for_Discriminative_Dependency_Parsing.html">39 acl-2011-An Ensemble Model that Combines Syntactic and Semantic Clustering for Discriminative Dependency Parsing</a></p>

<p>Author: Colin Cherry ; Shane Bergsma</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based dependency parsing can be sped up significantly if implausible arcs are eliminated from the search-space before parsing begins. State-of-the-art methods for arc filtering use separate classifiers to make pointwise decisions about the tree; they label tokens with roles such as root, leaf, or attaches-tothe-left, and then filter arcs accordingly. Because these classifiers overlap substantially in their filtering consequences, we propose to train them jointly, so that each classifier can focus on the gaps of the others. We integrate the various pointwise decisions as latent variables in a single arc-level SVM classifier. This novel framework allows us to combine nine pointwise filters, and adjust their sensitivity using a shared threshold based on arc length. Our system filters 32% more arcs than the independently-trained classifiers, without reducing filtering speed. This leads to faster parsing with no reduction in accuracy.</p><p>2 0.89588499 <a title="186-lsi-2" href="./acl-2011-Lexicographic_Semirings_for_Exact_Automata_Encoding_of_Sequence_Models.html">210 acl-2011-Lexicographic Semirings for Exact Automata Encoding of Sequence Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Brian Roark ; Richard Sproat ; Izhak Shafran</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce a novel use of the lexicographic semiring and motivate its use for speech and language processing tasks. We prove that the semiring allows for exact encoding of backoff models with epsilon transitions. This allows for off-line optimization of exact models represented as large weighted finite-state transducers in contrast to implicit (on-line) failure transition representations. We present preliminary empirical results demonstrating that, even in simple intersection scenarios amenable to the use of failure transitions, the use of the more powerful lexicographic semiring is competitive in terms of time of intersection. 1 Introduction and Motivation Representing smoothed n-gram language models as weighted finite-state transducers (WFST) is most naturally done with a failure transition, which reflects the semantics of the “otherwise” formulation of smoothing (Allauzen et al., 2003). For example, the typical backoff formulation of the probability of a word w given a history h is as follows P(w | h) = ?αPh(Pw( |w h )| h0) oift hc(ehrwwis)e > 0 (1) where P is an empirical estimate of the probability that reserves small finite probability for unseen n-grams; αh is a backoff weight that ensures normalization; and h0 is a backoff history typically achieved by excising the earliest word in the history h. The principle benefit of encoding the WFST in this way is that it only requires explicitly storing n-gram transitions for observed n-grams, i.e., count greater than zero, as opposed to all possible n-grams of the given order which would be infeasible in for example large vocabulary speech recognition. This is a massive space savings, and such an approach is also used for non-probabilistic stochastic language 1 models, such as those trained with the perceptron algorithm (Roark et al., 2007), as the means to access all and exactly those features that should fire for a particular sequence in a deterministic automaton. Similar issues hold for other finite-state se- quence processing problems, e.g., tagging, bracketing or segmenting. Failure transitions, however, are an implicit method for representing a much larger explicit automaton in the case of n-gram models, all possible n-grams for that order. During composition with the model, the failure transition must be interpreted on the fly, keeping track of those symbols that have already been found leaving the original state, and only allowing failure transition traversal for symbols that have not been found (the semantics of “otherwise”). This compact implicit representation cannot generally be preserved when composing with other models, e.g., when combining a language model with a pronunciation lexicon as in widelyused FST approaches to speech recognition (Mohri et al., 2002). Moving from implicit to explicit representation when performing such a composition leads to an explosion in the size of the resulting transducer, frequently making the approach intractable. In practice, an off-line approximation to the model is made, typically by treating the failure transitions as epsilon transitions (Mohri et al., 2002; Allauzen et al., 2003), allowing large transducers to be composed and optimized off-line. These complex approximate transducers are then used during first-pass – decoding, and the resulting pruned search graphs (e.g., word lattices) can be rescored with exact language models encoded with failure transitions. Similar problems arise when building, say, POStaggers as WFST: not every pos-tag sequence will have been observed during training, hence failure transitions will achieve great savings in the size of models. Yet discriminative models may include complex features that combine both input stream (word) and output stream (tag) sequences in a single feature, yielding complicated transducer topologies for which effective use of failure transitions may not Proceedings Pofo trhtlea 4nd9,th O Arnegnouna,l J Muneeet 1in9g-2 o4f, t 2h0e1 A1s.s ?oc ci2a0t1io1n A fosrso Ccioamtiopnut faotrio Cnoaml Lpiuntgauti osntiacls: Lsihnogrutpisatipcesrs, pages 1–5, be possible. An exact encoding using other mechanisms is required in such cases to allow for off-line representation and optimization. In this paper, we introduce a novel use of a semiring the lexicographic semiring (Golan, 1999) which permits an exact encoding of these sorts of models with the same compact topology as with failure transitions, but using epsilon transitions. Unlike the standard epsilon approximation, this semiring allows for an exact representation, while also allowing (unlike failure transition approaches) for off-line – – composition with other transducers, with all the optimizations that such representations provide. In the next section, we introduce the semiring, followed by a proof that its use yields exact representations. We then conclude with a brief evaluation of the cost of intersection relative to failure transitions in comparable situations. 2 The Lexicographic Semiring Weighted automata are automata in which the transitions carry weight elements of a semiring (Kuich and Salomaa, 1986). A semiring is a ring that may lack negation, with two associative operations ⊕ and ⊗lac akn nde tghaetiiro nre,ws piethcti twveo i dasesnotictiya ievleem oepnertas t 0io annsd ⊕ ⊕ 1. a nAd ⊗com anmdo tnh esierm reirsipnegc tiivn es pideeenchti ayn edl elmanegnutasg 0e processing, and one that we will be using in this paper, is the tropical semiring (R ∪ {∞}, min, +, ∞, 0), i.e., tmhein t riosp tihcea l⊕ s omfi trhineg gs(e mRi∪rin{g∞ (w},imthi nid,e+nt,i∞ty ,∞0)), ia.end., m+ ins tihse t ⊗e o⊕f othfe t hseem seirminigri n(wg i(wth tidhe indteitnyt t0y). ∞Th)i asn ids a+pp isro thpreia ⊗te o ofof rth h pee srfeomrmiri nngg (Vwitietrhb iid seenatricthy u0s).in Tgh negative log probabilities – we add negative logs along a path and take the min between paths.

Each state in the automaton represents an n-gram history string h and each n-gram arc is weighted with the (negative log) conditional probability of the word w labeling the arc given the history h. For a given history h and n-gram arc labeled with a word w, the destination of the arc is the state associated with the longest suffix of the string hw that is a history in the model. This will depend on the Markov order of the n-gram model. For example, consider the trigram model schematic shown in Figure 1, in which only history sequences of length 2 are kept in the model. Thus, from history hi = wi−2wi−1, the word wi transitions to hi+1 = wi−1wi, w2hii−ch1 is the longest suffix of hiwi in the modie−l1. As detailed in the “otherwise” semantics of equation 1, backoff arcs transition from state h to a state h0, typically the suffix of h of length |h| − 1, with we,i tgyhpti c(a−lllyog th αeh s)u.

We prove this by induction on the state-sequence of the path p/p0 up to a given state si/si0 in the respective machines M/M0. Base case: If p/p0 is of length 0, and therefore the states si/si0 are the initial states of the respective machines, the proposition clearly holds. Inductive step: Now suppose that p/p0 visits s0...si/s00...si0 and we have therefore reached si/si0 in the respective machines. Suppose the cumulated weights of p/p0 are W and hΨ, Wi, respectively. We wish to show thaarte w Whic anhedv heΨr sj isi n reexspt evcitsiivteedly o. nW p (i.e., the path becomes s0...sisj) the equivalent state s0 is visited on p0 (i.e., the path becomes s00...si0s0j). Let w be the next symbol to be matched leaving states si and si0. There are four cases to consider: (1) there is an n-gram arc leaving states si and si0 labeled with w, but no backoff arc leaving the state; (2) there is no n-gram arc labeled with w leaving the states, but there is a backoff arc; (3) there is no ngram arc labeled with w and no backoff arc leaving the states; and (4) there is both an n-gram arc labeled with w and a backoff arc leaving the states. In cases (1) and (2), there is only one possible transition to take in either M or M0, and based on the algorithm for construction of M0 given in Section 3.2, these transitions will point to sj and s0j respectively. Case (3) leads to failure of intersection with either machine. This leaves case (4) to consider. In M, since there is a transition leaving state si labeled with w, the backoff arc, which is a failure transition, cannot be traversed, hence the destination of the n-gram arc sj will be the next state in p. However, in M0, both the n-gram transition labeled with w and the backoff transition, now labeled with ?, can be traversed. What we will now prove is that the shortest path through M0 cannot include taking the backoff arc in this case. In order to emit w by taking the backoff arc out of state si0, one or more backoff (?) transitions must be taken, followed by an n-gram arc labeled with w. Let k be the order of the history represented by state si0, hence the cost of the first backoff arc is h(n − k)Φ, −log(αsi0 )i in our semiring. If we tirsa vhe(rns e− km) Φ b,a−ckloofgf( αarcs) ip irnior o tro eemmiitrtiinngg. the w, the first dimension of our accumulated cost will be m(n −k + m−21)Φ, based on our algorithm for consmtr(unct−ionk +of M0 given in Section 3.2. Let sl0 be the destination state after traversing m backoff arcs followed by an n-gram arc labeled with w. Note that, by definition, m ≤ k, and k − m + 1 is the orbdeyr oeffi nstitaitoen ,sl0 m. B≤ as ked, onnd t khe − c mons +tru 1ct iiosn t ealg oor-rithm, the state sl0 is also reachable by first emitting w from state si0 to reach state s0j followed by some number of backoff transitions. The order of state s0j is either k (if k is the highest order in the model) or k + 1 (by extending the history of state si0 by one word). If it is of order k, then it will require m −1 backoff arcs to reach state sl0, one fewer tqhuainre t mhe− −pa1t hb ctok osftfat aer ss0l oth raeta cbheg sitanste w sith a backoff arc, for a total cost of (m − 1) (n − k + m−21)Φ which is less than m(n − k + m−21)Φ.

The lexicographic semiring was evaluated on the development 4 set (2.6 hours of broadcast news and conversations; 18K words). The 888 word lattices for the development set were generated using a competitive baseline system with acoustic models trained on about 1000 hrs of Arabic broadcast data and a 4-gram language model. The language model consisting of 122M n-grams was estimated by interpolation of 14 components. The vocabulary is relatively large at 737K and the associated dictionary has only single pronunciations. The language model was converted to the automaton topology described earlier, and represented in three ways: first as an approximation of a failure machine using epsilons instead of failure arcs; second as a correct failure machine; and third using the lexicographic construction derived in this paper. The three versions of the LM were evaluated by intersecting them with the 888 lattices of the development set. The overall error rate for the systems was 24.8%—comparable to the state-of-theart on this task1 . For the shortest paths, the failure and lexicographic machines always produced identical lattices (as determined by FST equivalence); in contrast, 81% of the shortest paths from the epsilon approximation are different, at least in terms of weights, from the shortest paths using the failure LM. For full lattices, 42 (4.7%) of the lexicographic outputs differ from the failure LM outputs, due to small floating point rounding issues; 863 (97%) of the epsilon approximation outputs differ. In terms of size, the failure LM, with 5.7 million arcs requires 97 Mb.

The 1The error rate is a couple of points higher than in Lehr and Shafran (2011) since we discarded non-lexical words, which are absent in maximum likelihood estimated language model and are typically augmented to the unigram backoff state with an arbitrary cost, fine-tuned to optimize performance for a given task. 2If size became an issue, the first dimension of the hT, TiweigIhft scizane bbee c raemprees aennt iesdsu eby, tah esi fnigrlste bdyimtee. slightly slower speeds for the exact method using the failure LM, and hT, Ti can be related to the overhfaeialdur eof L cMom, apnudtin hgT ,tThei f caailnur bee f urenlcattieodn aot rhuen toivmeer,and determinization, respectively. 6 Conclusion In this paper we have introduced a novel application of the lexicographic semiring, proved that it can be used to provide an exact encoding of language model topologies with failure arcs, and provided experimental results that demonstrate its efficiency.

We are currently exploring the use of a lexicographic semiring that involves different semirings in the various dimensions, for the integration of part-of-speech taggers into language models. An implementation of the lexicographic semiring by the second author is already available as part of the OpenFst package (Allauzen et al., 2007). The methods described here are part of the NGram language-model-training toolkit, soon to be released at opengrm .org.

<p>Author: Prashanth Mannem ; Aswarth Dara</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has shown how a parallel corpus can be leveraged to build syntactic parser for a target language by projecting automatic source parse onto the target sentence using word alignments. The projected target dependency parses are not always fully connected to be useful for training traditional dependency parsers. In this paper, we present a greedy non-directional parsing algorithm which doesn’t need a fully connected parse and can learn from partial parses by utilizing available structural and syntactic information in them. Our parser achieved statistically significant improvements over a baseline system that trains on only fully connected parses for Bulgarian, Spanish and Hindi. It also gave a significant improvement over previously reported results for Bulgarian and set a benchmark for Hindi.</p><p>4 0.64209235 <a title="186-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Dynamic_Programming_Algorithms_for_Transition-Based_Dependency_Parsers.html">107 acl-2011-Dynamic Programming Algorithms for Transition-Based Dependency Parsers</a></p>

<p>Author: Y. Albert Park ; Roger Levy</p><p>Abstract: Automated grammar correction techniques have seen improvement over the years, but there is still much room for increased performance. Current correction techniques mainly focus on identifying and correcting a specific type of error, such as verb form misuse or preposition misuse, which restricts the corrections to a limited scope. We introduce a novel technique, based on a noisy channel model, which can utilize the whole sentence context to determine proper corrections. We show how to use the EM algorithm to learn the parameters of the noise model, using only a data set of erroneous sentences, given the proper language model. This frees us from the burden of acquiring a large corpora of corrected sentences. We also present a cheap and efficient way to provide automated evaluation re- sults for grammar corrections by using BLEU and METEOR, in contrast to the commonly used manual evaluations.</p><p>6 0.49022418 <a title="186-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Integrating_surprisal_and_uncertain-input_models_in_online_sentence_comprehension%3A_formal_techniques_and_empirical_results.html">176 acl-2011-Integrating surprisal and uncertain-input models in online sentence comprehension: formal techniques and empirical results</a></p>

<p>Author: Sujith Ravi ; Kevin Knight</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel Bayesian approach for deciphering complex substitution ciphers. Our method uses a decipherment model which combines information from letter n-gram language models as well as word dictionaries. Bayesian inference is performed on our model using an efficient sampling technique. We evaluate the quality of the Bayesian decipherment output on simple and homophonic letter substitution ciphers and show that unlike a previous approach, our method consistently produces almost 100% accurate decipherments. The new method can be applied on more complex substitution ciphers and we demonstrate its utility by cracking the famous Zodiac-408 cipher in a fully automated fashion, which has never been done before.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.79884917 <a title="186-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Joint_Training_of_Dependency_Parsing_Filters_through_Latent_Support_Vector_Machines.html">186 acl-2011-Joint Training of Dependency Parsing Filters through Latent Support Vector Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Colin Cherry ; Shane Bergsma</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based dependency parsing can be sped up significantly if implausible arcs are eliminated from the search-space before parsing begins. State-of-the-art methods for arc filtering use separate classifiers to make pointwise decisions about the tree; they label tokens with roles such as root, leaf, or attaches-tothe-left, and then filter arcs accordingly. Because these classifiers overlap substantially in their filtering consequences, we propose to train them jointly, so that each classifier can focus on the gaps of the others. We integrate the various pointwise decisions as latent variables in a single arc-level SVM classifier. This novel framework allows us to combine nine pointwise filters, and adjust their sensitivity using a shared threshold based on arc length. Our system filters 32% more arcs than the independently-trained classifiers, without reducing filtering speed. This leads to faster parsing with no reduction in accuracy.</p><p>3 0.78159684 <a title="186-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Lexical_Normalisation_of_Short_Text_Messages%3A_Makn_Sens_a_%23twitter.html">208 acl-2011-Lexical Normalisation of Short Text Messages: Makn Sens a #twitter</a></p>
<p>Author: Bo Han ; Timothy Baldwin</p><p>Abstract: Twitter provides access to large volumes of data in real time, but is notoriously noisy, hampering its utility for NLP. In this paper, we target out-of-vocabulary words in short text messages and propose a method for identifying and normalising ill-formed words. Our method uses a classifier to detect ill-formed words, and generates correction candidates based on morphophonemic similarity. Both word similarity and context are then exploited to select the most probable correction candidate for the word. The proposed method doesn’t require any annotations, and achieves state-of-the-art performance over an SMS corpus and a novel dataset based on Twitter.</p><p>4 0.75243115 <a title="186-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Joint_Identification_and_Segmentation_of_Domain-Specific_Dialogue_Acts_for_Conversational_Dialogue_Systems.html">185 acl-2011-Joint Identification and Segmentation of Domain-Specific Dialogue Acts for Conversational Dialogue Systems</a></p>

<p>Author: Amitava Das</p><p>Abstract: Sentiment analysis is one of the hot demanding research areas since last few decades. Although a formidable amount of research has been done but still the existing reported solutions or available systems are far from perfect or to meet the satisfaction level of end user's. The main issue may be there are many conceptual rules that govern sentiment, and there are even more clues (possibly unlimited) that can convey these concepts from realization to verbalization of a human being. Human psychology directly relates to the unrevealed clues; govern the sentiment realization of us. Human psychology relates many things like social psychology, culture, pragmatics and many more endless intelligent aspects of civilization. Proper incorporation of human psychology into computational sentiment knowledge representation may solve the problem. PsychoSentiWordNet is an extension over SentiWordNet that holds human psychological knowledge and sentiment knowledge simultaneously. 1</p><p>6 0.72420245 <a title="186-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Social_Network_Extraction_from_Texts%3A_A_Thesis_Proposal.html">286 acl-2011-Social Network Extraction from Texts: A Thesis Proposal</a></p>

</p><p>14 We explore more linguistically motivated approaches to detect vandalism in this paper. [sent-36, score-0.798]
</p><p>15 Our hypothesis is that textual vandalism constitutes a unique genre where a group of people share similar linguistic behavior. [sent-37, score-0.808]
</p><p>16 Some obvious hallmarks of this style include usage of obscenities, misspellings, and slang usage, but we aim to automatically uncover stylistic cues to effectively discriminate between vandalizing and normal text. [sent-38, score-0.377]
</p><p>17 Experimental results suggest that (1) statistical models give evidence to unique language styles in vandalism, and that (2) deep syntactic patterns based on probabilistic context free grammar (PCFG) discriminate vandalism more effectively than shallow lexico-syntactic patterns based on n-grams. [sent-39, score-1.122]
</p><p>18 2  Stylometric Features  Stylometric features attempt to recognize patterns of style in text. [sent-40, score-0.109]
</p><p>19 These techniques have been traditionally applied to attribute authorship (Argamon et al. [sent-41, score-0.063]
</p><p>20 For our purposes, we hypothesize that different stylistic features appear in regular and vandalizing edits. [sent-46, score-0.311]
</p><p>21 For regular edits, honest editors will strive to follow the stylistic guidelines set forth by Wikipedia (e. [sent-47, score-0.149]
</p><p>22 For edits that vandalize articles, these users may converge on common ways of vandalizing articles. [sent-50, score-0.405]
</p><p>23 1 Language Models To differentiate between the styles of normal users and vandalizers, we employ language models to capture the stylistic differences between authentic and vandalizing revisions. [sent-52, score-0.326]
</p><p>24 We train two trigram language model (LM) with Good-Turing discounting  and Katz backoff for smoothing of vandalizing edits (based on the text difference between the vandalizing and previous revision) and good edits (based on the text difference between the new and previous revision). [sent-53, score-0.86]
</p><p>25 2  Probabilistic Context Free Grammar (PCFG) Models Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFG) capture deep syntactic regularities beyond shallow lexicosyntactic patterns. [sent-55, score-0.17]
</p><p>26 (2010) reported for the first time that PCFG models are effective in learning stylometric signature of authorship at deep syntactic levels. [sent-57, score-0.291]
</p><p>27 In this work, we explore the use of PCFG models for vandalism detection, by viewing the task as a genre detection problem, where a group of authors share similar linguistic behavior. [sent-58, score-0.811]
</p><p>28 (1) Given a training corpus D for vandalism detection and a generic PCFG parser Co trained on a manually tree-banked corpus such as WSJ  or Brown, tree-bank each training document di ∈ D using the generic PCFG parser Co. [sent-61, score-0.826]
</p><p>29 (2) Learn vandalism language by training a new PCFG parser Cvandal using only those treebanked documents in D that correspond to vandalism. [sent-62, score-0.757]
</p><p>30 Likewise, learn regular Wikipedia language by training a new PCFG parser Cregular 84 using only those tree-banked documents in D that correspond to regular Wikipedia edits. [sent-63, score-0.092]
</p><p>31 (3) For each test document, compare the probability of the edit determined by Cvandal and Cregular, where the parser with the higher score determines the class of the edit. [sent-64, score-0.095]
</p><p>32 3  System Description  Our system decides if an edit to an article is vandal-  ism by training a classifier based on a set of features derived from many different aspects of the edit. [sent-66, score-0.174]
</p><p>33 , 2010) of Wikipedia edits where revisions are labeled as either vandalizing or non-vandalizing. [sent-68, score-0.465]
</p><p>34 This section will describe in brief the features used by our classifier, a more exhaustive description of our non-linguistically motivated features can be found in Harpalani et al. [sent-69, score-0.074]
</p><p>35 1 Features Based on Metadata Our classifier takes into account metadata generated by the revision. [sent-72, score-0.114]
</p><p>36 We generate features based on author reputation by recording if the edit is submitted by an anonymous user or a registered user. [sent-73, score-0.288]
</p><p>37 If the author is registered, we record how long he has been registered, how many times he has previously vandalized Wikipedia, and how frequent he edits articles. [sent-74, score-0.327]
</p><p>38 We generate features based on the characteristics ofthe articles revision history. [sent-76, score-0.154]
</p><p>39 This includes how many times the article has been previously vandalized, the last time it was edited, how many times it has been reverted and other related features. [sent-77, score-0.071]
</p><p>40 2 Features Based on Lexical Cues Our classifier also employs a subset of features that rely on lexical cues. [sent-79, score-0.067]
</p><p>41 Simple strategies such as counting the number of vulgarities present in the revision are effective to capture obvious forms of vandalism. [sent-80, score-0.128]
</p><p>42 We measure the edit distance between the old and new revision, the number of repeated patterns, slang words, vulgarities and pronouns, the type of edit (insert, modification or delete) and other similar features. [sent-81, score-0.219]
</p><p>43 3 Features Based on Sentiment Wikipedia editors strive to maintain a neutral and objective voice in articles. [sent-87, score-0.072]
</p><p>44 Vandals, however, insert subjective and polar statements into articles. [sent-88, score-0.022]
</p><p>45 We  build two classifiers based on the work of Pang and Lee (2004) to measure the polarity and objectivity of article edits. [sent-89, score-0.067]
</p><p>46 We train the classifier on how many positive and negative sentences were inserted as well as the overall change in the sentiment score from the previous version to the new revision and the number of inserted or deleted subjective sentences in the revision. [sent-90, score-0.212]
</p><p>47 We take the log-likelihood of the regular edit and vandalizing edit LMs. [sent-93, score-0.364]
</p><p>48 For our PCFG, we take the difference between the minimum log-likelihood score (i. [sent-94, score-0.025]
</p><p>49 4  Experimental Results  Data We use the 2010 PAN Wikipedia vandalism corpus Potthast et al. [sent-103, score-0.737]

</p><p>51 This corpus comprises of 32452 edits on 28468 articles, with 2391 of the edits identified as vandalism by human annotators. [sent-115, score-1.191]
</p><p>52 The class distribution is highly skewed, as only 7% of edits corresponds to vandalism. [sent-116, score-0.227]
</p><p>53 deletions, template changes), we focus only on those edits that inserted or modified text (17145 edits in total) since stylometric features are not relevant to deletes and template modifications. [sent-119, score-0.749]
</p><p>54 Note that insertions and modifications are the main source for vandalism. [sent-120, score-0.02]
</p><p>55 We randomly separated 15000 edits for training of Cvandal and Cregular, and 17444 edits for testing, preserving the ratio of vandalism to non-vandalism revisions. [sent-121, score-1.191]
</p><p>56 We eliminated 7359 of the testing edits to remove revisions that were exclusively template modifications (e. [sent-122, score-0.331]
</p><p>57 inserting a link) and maintain the observed ratio of vandalism for a total of 10085 edits. [sent-124, score-0.737]
</p><p>58 For each edit in the test set, we com-  pute the probability of each modified sentence for Cvandal and Cregular and generate the statistics for the features described in 3. [sent-125, score-0.112]
</p><p>59 We compare the performance of the language models and stylometric features against a baseline classifier that is trained on metadata, lexical and sentiment features using 10 fold stratified cross validation on the test set. [sent-127, score-0.325]
</p><p>60 Because our dataset is highly skewed (97% corresponds to “not vandalism”), we report F-score and  line+PCFG features. [sent-129, score-0.021]
</p><p>61 Notice that several stylistic features present in these sentences are unlikely to appear in normal Wikipedia articles. [sent-131, score-0.128]
</p><p>62 1 The baseline system, which includes a wide range of features that are shown to be highly effective in vandalism detection, achieves F-score 52. [sent-133, score-0.794]
</p><p>63 The baseline features include all features introduced in Section 3. [sent-136, score-0.094]
</p><p>64 Adding language model features to the baseline (denoted as +LM in Table 1) increases the F-score slightly (53. [sent-137, score-0.057]
</p><p>65 Adding PCFG based features to the baseline (denoted as +PCFG) brings the most substantial performance improvement: it increases recall substantially while also improving precision, achieving 57. [sent-140, score-0.057]
</p><p>66 Combining both PCFG and language model based features (denoted as +LM+PCFG) only results in a slight improvement in AUC. [sent-143, score-0.037]
</p><p>67 From these results, we draw the following conclusions: •  There are indeed unique language styles in van-  dTahleisrme a rteh aint can u ben qdueete lcatnegdu awgieth s stylometric analysis. [sent-144, score-0.258]
</p><p>68 •  Rather unexpectedly, deep syntax oriented featRuartehse bra usneedx on PteCdlFyG, bring a mtaxuc ohr more s fueba-stantial improvement than language models that capture only shallow lexico-syntactic patterns. [sent-145, score-0.129]
</p><p>69 1A naive rule that always chooses the majority class (“not vandalism ”) will receive zero F-score. [sent-146, score-0.756]
</p><p>70 Dry wit, for example, relies on context and may receive a good score from the parser trained on regular Wikipedia edits (Cregular). [sent-148, score-0.302]
</p><p>71 Notice that several of our PCFG features are in the top ten most informative features. [sent-150, score-0.037]
</p><p>72 Language model based features were ranked very low in the list, hence we do not include them in the list. [sent-151, score-0.037]
</p><p>73 This finding will be potentially ad-  vantageous to many of the current anti-vandalism tools such as vulgarisms, which rely only on shallow lexico-syntactic patterns. [sent-152, score-0.077]
</p><p>74 Examples To provide more insight to the task, Table 3 shows several instances where the addition of the PCFG derived features detected vandalism that the baseline approach could not. [sent-153, score-0.794]
</p><p>75 Notice that the first example contains a lot of conjunctions that would be hard to characterize using shallow lexicosyntactic features. [sent-154, score-0.118]
</p><p>76 It looks almost like a benign edit, however, what makes it a vandalism is the phrase “(Happy Birthday)” inserted in the middle. [sent-157, score-0.771]
</p><p>77 Table 4 shows examples where all of our systems could not detect the vandalism correctly. [sent-158, score-0.776]
</p><p>78 Notice that examples in Table 4 generally manifest more a formal voice than those in Table 3. [sent-159, score-0.019]
</p><p>79 5  Related Work  Wang and McKeown (2010) present the first approach that is linguistically motivated. [sent-160, score-0.022]
</p><p>80 Their ap-  proach was based on shallow syntactic patterns, while ours explores the use of deep syntactic patterns, and performs a comparative evaluation across different stylometry analysis techniques. [sent-161, score-0.129]
</p><p>81 It is worthwhile to note that the approach of Wang and McKeown (2010) is not as practical and scalable as ours in that it requires crawling a substantial number (150) of webpages to detect each vandalism edit. [sent-162, score-0.806]
</p><p>82 From our pilot study based on 1600 edits (50% of which is vandalism), we found that the topic-specific language models built from web search do not produce stronger result than PCFG based features. [sent-163, score-0.227]
</p><p>83 We do not have a result directly comparable to theirs however, as we could not crawl the necessary webpages required to match the size of corpus. [sent-164, score-0.03]
</p><p>84 The standard approach to Wikipedia vandalism detection is to develop a feature based on either the content or metadata and train a classifier to recognize it. [sent-165, score-0.923]
</p><p>85 A comprehensive overview of what types of features have been employed for this task can be found in Potthast et al. [sent-166, score-0.037]
</p><p>86 WikiTrust, a reputation system for Wikipedia authors, focuses on determining the likely quality of a contribution (Adler and de Alfaro, 2007). [sent-168, score-0.06]
</p><p>87 6  Future Work and Conclusion  This paper presents a vandalism detection system for Wikipedia that uses stylometric features to aide in classification. [sent-169, score-0.999]
</p><p>88 We show that deep syntactic patterns based on PCFGs more effectively identify vandalism than shallow lexico-syntactic patterns based on n-grams or contextual language models. [sent-170, score-0.983]
</p><p>89 Rather, PCFGs are able to detect differences in language styles between vandalizing edits and normal edits to Wikipedia articles. [sent-172, score-0.759]
</p><p>90 We look to automate the expansion of the training set of vandalized revisions to include examples from outside of Wikipedia that reflect similar language styles. [sent-175, score-0.119]

<p>Author: Oliver Ferschke ; Torsten Zesch ; Iryna Gurevych</p><p>Abstract: We present an open-source toolkit which allows (i) to reconstruct past states of Wikipedia, and (ii) to efficiently access the edit history of Wikipedia articles. Reconstructing past states of Wikipedia is a prerequisite for reproducing previous experimental work based on Wikipedia. Beyond that, the edit history of Wikipedia articles has been shown to be a valuable knowledge source for NLP, but access is severely impeded by the lack of efficient tools for managing the huge amount of provided data. By using a dedicated storage format, our toolkit massively decreases the data volume to less than 2% of the original size, and at the same time provides an easy-to-use interface to access the revision data. The language-independent design allows to process any language represented in Wikipedia. We expect this work to consolidate NLP research using Wikipedia in general, and to foster research making use of the knowledge encoded in Wikipedia’s edit history.</p><p>3 0.086533651 <a title="195-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Exploring_Entity_Relations_for_Named_Entity_Disambiguation.html">128 acl-2011-Exploring Entity Relations for Named Entity Disambiguation</a></p>
<p>Author: Danuta Ploch</p><p>Abstract: Named entity disambiguation is the task of linking an entity mention in a text to the correct real-world referent predefined in a knowledge base, and is a crucial subtask in many areas like information retrieval or topic detection and tracking. Named entity disambiguation is challenging because entity mentions can be ambiguous and an entity can be referenced by different surface forms. We present an approach that exploits Wikipedia relations between entities co-occurring with the ambiguous form to derive a range of novel features for classifying candidate referents. We find that our features improve disambiguation results significantly over a strong popularity baseline, and are especially suitable for recognizing entities not contained in the knowledge base. Our system achieves state-of-the-art results on the TAC-KBP 2009 dataset.</p><p>4 0.078890689 <a title="195-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-The_Surprising_Variance_in_Shortest-Derivation_Parsing.html">300 acl-2011-The Surprising Variance in Shortest-Derivation Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohit Bansal ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We investigate full-scale shortest-derivation parsing (SDP), wherein the parser selects an analysis built from the fewest number of training fragments. Shortest derivation parsing exhibits an unusual range of behaviors. At one extreme, in the fully unpruned case, it is neither fast nor accurate. At the other extreme, when pruned with a coarse unlexicalized PCFG, the shortest derivation criterion becomes both fast and surprisingly effective, rivaling more complex weighted-fragment approaches. Our analysis includes an investigation of tie-breaking and associated dynamic programs.

We introduce a new data set that pairs English Wikipedia with Simple English Wikipedia and is orders of magnitude larger than any previously examined for sentence simplification. The data contains the full range of simplification operations including rewording, reordering, insertion and deletion. We provide an analysis of this corpus as well as preliminary results using a phrase-based trans- lation approach for simplification.</p><p>6 0.075234421 <a title="195-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Lost_in_Translation%3A_Authorship_Attribution_using_Frame_Semantics.html">214 acl-2011-Lost in Translation: Authorship Attribution using Frame Semantics</a></p>

<p>Author: Manoj Harpalani ; Michael Hart ; Sandesh Signh ; Rob Johnson ; Yejin Choi</p><p>Abstract: Community-based knowledge forums, such as Wikipedia, are susceptible to vandalism, i.e., ill-intentioned contributions that are detrimental to the quality of collective intelligence. Most previous work to date relies on shallow lexico-syntactic patterns and metadata to automatically detect vandalism in Wikipedia. In this paper, we explore more linguistically motivated approaches to vandalism detection. In particular, we hypothesize that textual vandalism constitutes a unique genre where a group of people share a similar linguistic behavior. Experimental results suggest that (1) statistical models give evidence to unique language styles in vandalism, and that (2) deep syntactic patterns based on probabilistic context free grammars (PCFG) discriminate vandalism more effectively than shallow lexicosyntactic patterns based on n-grams. ,</p><p>2 0.86381245 <a title="195-lsi-2" href="./acl-2011-Wikipedia_Revision_Toolkit%3A_Efficiently_Accessing_Wikipedias_Edit_History.html">337 acl-2011-Wikipedia Revision Toolkit: Efficiently Accessing Wikipedias Edit History</a></p>
<p>Author: Oliver Ferschke ; Torsten Zesch ; Iryna Gurevych</p><p>Abstract: We present an open-source toolkit which allows (i) to reconstruct past states of Wikipedia, and (ii) to efficiently access the edit history of Wikipedia articles. Reconstructing past states of Wikipedia is a prerequisite for reproducing previous experimental work based on Wikipedia. Beyond that, the edit history of Wikipedia articles has been shown to be a valuable knowledge source for NLP, but access is severely impeded by the lack of efficient tools for managing the huge amount of provided data. By using a dedicated storage format, our toolkit massively decreases the data volume to less than 2% of the original size, and at the same time provides an easy-to-use interface to access the revision data. The language-independent design allows to process any language represented in Wikipedia. We expect this work to consolidate NLP research using Wikipedia in general, and to foster research making use of the knowledge encoded in Wikipedia’s edit history.</p><p>3 0.70226568 <a title="195-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-Local_and_Global_Algorithms_for_Disambiguation_to_Wikipedia.html">213 acl-2011-Local and Global Algorithms for Disambiguation to Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>Author: Lev Ratinov ; Dan Roth ; Doug Downey ; Mike Anderson</p><p>Abstract: Disambiguating concepts and entities in a context sensitive way is a fundamental problem in natural language processing. The comprehensiveness of Wikipedia has made the online encyclopedia an increasingly popular target for disambiguation. Disambiguation to Wikipedia is similar to a traditional Word Sense Disambiguation task, but distinct in that the Wikipedia link structure provides additional information about which disambiguations are compatible. In this work we analyze approaches that utilize this information to arrive at coherent sets of disambiguations for a given document (which we call “global” approaches), and compare them to more traditional (local) approaches. We show that previous approaches for global disambiguation can be improved, but even then the local disambiguation provides a baseline which is very hard to beat.</p><p>4 0.57149011 <a title="195-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Simple_supervised_document_geolocation_with_geodesic_grids.html">285 acl-2011-Simple supervised document geolocation with geodesic grids</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin Wing ; Jason Baldridge</p><p>Abstract: We investigate automatic geolocation (i.e. identification of the location, expressed as latitude/longitude coordinates) of documents. Geolocation can be an effective means of summarizing large document collections and it is an important component of geographic information retrieval. We describe several simple supervised methods for document geolocation using only the document’s raw text as evidence. All of our methods predict locations in the context of geodesic grids of varying degrees of resolution. We evaluate the methods on geotagged Wikipedia articles and Twitter feeds. For Wikipedia, our best method obtains a median prediction error of just 11.8 kilometers. Twitter geolocation is more challenging: we obtain a median error of 479 km, an improvement on previous results for the dataset.</p><p>5 0.50701624 <a title="195-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Wikulu%3A_An_Extensible_Architecture_for_Integrating_Natural_Language_Processing_Techniques_with_Wikis.html">338 acl-2011-Wikulu: An Extensible Architecture for Integrating Natural Language Processing Techniques with Wikis</a></p>

<p>Author: Ulrich Schafer ; Bernd Kiefer ; Christian Spurk ; Jorg Steffen ; Rui Wang</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel application for structured search in scientific digital libraries. The ACL Anthology Searchbench is meant to become a publicly available research tool to query the content of the ACL Anthology. The application provides search in both its bibliographic metadata and semantically analyzed full textual content. By combining these two features, very efficient and focused queries are possible. At the same time, the application serves as a showcase for the recent progress in natural language processing (NLP) research and language technology. The system currently indexes the textual content of 7,500 anthology papers from 2002–2009 with predicateargument-like semantic structures. It also provides useful search filters based on bibliographic metadata. It will be extended to provide the full anthology content and en- . hanced functionality based on further NLP techniques. 1 Introduction and Motivation Scientists in all disciplines nowadays are faced with a flood of new publications every day. In addition, more and more publications from the past become digitally available and thus even increase the amount. Finding relevant information and avoiding duplication of work have become urgent issues to be addressed by the scientific community. The organization and preservation of scientific knowledge in scientific publications, vulgo text documents, thwarts these efforts. From a viewpoint of 7 dfki .de / lt a computer scientist, scientific papers are just ‘unstructured information’ . At least in our own scientific community, Computational Linguistics, it is generally assumed that NLP could help to support search in such document collections. The ACL Anthology1 is a comprehensive elec- tronic collection of scientific papers in our own field (Bird et al., 2008). It is updated regularly with new publications, but also older papers have been scanned and are made available electronically. We have implemented the ACL Anthology Searchbench2 for two reasons: Our first aim is to provide a more targeted search facility in this collection than standard web search on the anthology website. In this sense, the Searchbench is meant to become a service to our own community. Our second motivation is to use the developed system as a showcase for the progress that has been made over the last years in precision-oriented deep linguistic parsing in terms of both efficiency and coverage, specifically in the context of the DELPHIN community3. Our system also uses further NLP techniques such as unsupervised term extraction, named entity recognition and part-of-speech (PoS) tagging. By automatically precomputing normalized semantic representations (predicate-argument structure) of each sentence in the anthology, the search space is structured and allows to find equivalent or related predicates even if they are expressed differ- 1http : / /www . aclweb .org/ anthology 2http : //aclasb . dfki . de 3http : / /www . de lph-in . net – DELPH-IN stands for DEep Linguistic Processing with HPSG INitiative.

In addition, the Searchbench also provides detailed bibliographic metadata for filtering as well as autosuggest texts for input fields computed from the corpus two further key features one can expect from such systems today, nevertheless very important for efficient search in digital libraries. We describe the offline preprocessing and deep parsing approach in Section 2. Section 3 concentrates on the generation of the semantic search index. In Section 4, we describe the search interface. We conclude in Section 5 and present an outlook to future extensions. – 2 Parsing the ACL Anthology The basis of the search index for the ACL Anthology are its original PDF documents, currently 8,200 from the years 2002 through 2009. To overcome quality problems in text extraction from PDF, we use a commercial PDF extractor based on OCR techniques. This approach guarantees uniform and highquality textual representations even from older papers in the anthology (before 2000) which mostly were scanned from printed paper versions. The general idea of the semantics-oriented access to scholarly paper content is to parse each sentence they contain with the open-source HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994) grammar for English (ERG; Flickinger (2002)) and then distill and index semantically structured representations for search. To make the deep parser robust, it is embedded in a NLP workflow. The coverage (percentage of full deeply parsed sentences) on the anthology corpus could be increased from 65 % to now more than 85 % through careful combination of several robustness techniques; for example: (1) chart pruning, directed search during parsing to increase per- formance, and also coverage for longer sentences (Cramer and Zhang, 2010); (2) chart mapping, a novel method for integrating preprocessing information in exactly the way the deep grammar expects it (Adolphs et al., 2008); (3) new version of the ERG with better handling of open word classes; (4) 8 more fine-grained named entity recognition, including recognition of citation patterns; (5) new, better suited parse ranking model (WeScience; Flickinger et al. (2010)). Because of limited space, we will focus on (1) and (2) below. A more detailed description and further results are available in (Sch a¨fer and Kiefer, 2011). Except for a small part of the named entity recognition components (citations, some terminology) and the parse ranking model, there are no further adaptations to genre or domain of the text corpus. This implies that the NLP workflow could be easily and modularly adapted to other (scientific or nonscientific) domains—mainly thanks to the generic and comprehensive language modelling in the ERG. The NLP preprocessing component workflow is implemented using the Heart of Gold NLP middleware architecture (Sch a¨fer, 2006). It starts with sentence boundary detection (SBR) and regular expression-based tokenization using its built-in component JTok, followed by the trigram-based PoS tagger TnT (Brants, 2000) trained on the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and the named entity recognizer SProUT (Dro z˙d z˙y n´ski et al., 2004). 2.1 Precise Preprocessing Integration with Chart Mapping Tagger output is combined with information from the named entity recognizer, e.g. delivering hypothetical information on citation expressions. The combined result is delivered as input to the deep parser PET (Callmeier, 2000) running the ERG. Here, citations, for example, can be treated as either persons, locations or appositions. Concerning punctuation, the ERG can make use of information on opening and closing quotation marks. Such information is often not explicit in the input text, e.g. when, as in our setup, gained through OCR which does not distinguish between ‘ and ’ or “ and However, a tokenizer can often guess (recon- ”. struct) leftness and rightness correctly. This information, passed to the deep parser via chart mapping, helps it to disambiguate. 2.2 Increased Processing Speed and Coverage through Chart Pruning In addition to a well-established discriminative maximum entropy model for post-analysis parse selection, we use an additional generative model as described in Cramer and Zhang (2010) to restrict the search space during parsing. This restriction increases efficiency, but also coverage, because the parse time was restricted to at most 60 CPU seconds on a standard PC, and more sentences could now be parsed within these bounds. A 4 GB limit for main memory consumption was far beyond what was ever needed. We saw a small but negligible decrease in parsing accuracy, 5.4 % best parses were not found due to the pruning of important chart edges. Ninomiya et al. (2006) did a very thorough comparison ofdifferent performance optimization strategies, and among those also a local pruning strategy similar to the one used here. There is an important difference between the systems, in that theirs works on a reduced context-free backbone first and reconstructs the results with the full grammar, while PET uses the HPSG grammar directly, with subsumption packing and partial unpacking to achieve a similar effect as the packed chart of a context-free parser. sentence length −→ Figure 1: Distribution of sentence length and mean parse times for mild pruning In total, we parsed 1,537,801 sentences, of which 57,832 (3.8 %) could not be parsed because of lexicon errors. Most of them were caused by OCR ar- tifacts resulting in unexpected punctuation character combinations. These can be identified and will be deleted in the future. Figure 1 displays the average parse time of processing with a mild chart pruning setting, together with the mean quadratic error. In addition, it contains the distribution of input sentences over sentence length. Obviously, the vast majority of sen9 tences has a length of at most 60 words4. The parse times only grow mildly due to the many optimization techniques in the original system, and also the new chart pruning method. The sentence length distribution has been integrated into Figure 1 to show that the predominant part of our real-world corpus can be processed using this information-rich method with very low parse times (overall average parse time < 2 s per sentence). The large amount of short inputs is at first surprising, even more so that most of these inputs can not be parsed. Most of these inputs are non-sentences such as headings, enumerations, footnotes, table cell content. There are several alternatives to deal with such input, one to identify and handle them in a preprocessing step, another to use a special root condition in the deep analysis component that is able to combine phrases with well-defined properties for inputs where no spanning result could be found. We employed the second method, which has the advantage that it handles a larger range of phenomena in a homogeneous way. Figure 2 shows the change in percentage of unparsed and timed out inputs for the mild pruning method with and without the root condition combining fragments. sentence length −→ Figure 2: Unparsed and timed out sentences with and without fragment combination Figure 2 shows that this changes the curve for unparsed sentences towards more expected characteristics and removes the uncommonly high percentage of short sentences for which no parse can be computed. Together with the parses for fragmented 4It has to be pointed out that extremely long sentences also may be non-sentences resulting from PDF extraction errors, missing punctuation etc. No manual correction took place. Figure 3: Multiple semantic tuples may be generated for a sentence input, we get a recall (sentences with at least one parse) over the whole corpus of 85.9 % (1,321,336 sentences), without a significant change for any of the other measures, and with potential for further improvement. 3 Semantic Tuple Extraction with DMRS In contrast to shallow parsers, the ERG not only handles detailed syntactic analyses of phrases, com- pounds, coordination, negation and other linguistic phenomena that are important for extracting semantic relations, but also generates a formal semantic representation of the meaning of the input sentence in the Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) representation format (Copestake et al., 2005). It consists of elementary predications for each word and larger constituents, connected via argument positions and variables, from which predicate-argument structure can be extracted. MRS representations resulting from deep parsing are still relatively close to linguistic structures and contain more detailed information than a user would like to query and search for. Therefore, an additional extraction and abstraction step is performed before storing semantic structures in the search index. Firstly, MRS is converted to DMRS (Copestake, 2009), a dependency-style version of MRS that eases extraction of predicate-argument structure using the implementation in LKB (Copestake, 2002). The representation format we devised for the search index we call semantic tuples, in fact quintuples</p><p>same-paper 3 0.81605083 <a title="195-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Language_of_Vandalism%3A_Improving_Wikipedia_Vandalism_Detection_via_Stylometric_Analysis.html">195 acl-2011-Language of Vandalism: Improving Wikipedia Vandalism Detection via Stylometric Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Manoj Harpalani ; Michael Hart ; Sandesh Signh ; Rob Johnson ; Yejin Choi</p><p>Abstract: Community-based knowledge forums, such as Wikipedia, are susceptible to vandalism, i.e., ill-intentioned contributions that are detrimental to the quality of collective intelligence. Most previous work to date relies on shallow lexico-syntactic patterns and metadata to automatically detect vandalism in Wikipedia. In this paper, we explore more linguistically motivated approaches to vandalism detection. In particular, we hypothesize that textual vandalism constitutes a unique genre where a group of people share a similar linguistic behavior. Experimental results suggest that (1) statistical models give evidence to unique language styles in vandalism, and that (2) deep syntactic patterns based on probabilistic context free grammars (PCFG) discriminate vandalism more effectively than shallow lexicosyntactic patterns based on n-grams. ,</p><p>4 0.81541711 <a title="195-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Recognizing_Authority_in_Dialogue_with_an_Integer_Linear_Programming_Constrained_Model.html">260 acl-2011-Recognizing Authority in Dialogue with an Integer Linear Programming Constrained Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Elijah Mayfield ; Carolyn Penstein Rose</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel computational formulation of speaker authority in discourse. This notion, which focuses on how speakers position themselves relative to each other in discourse, is first developed into a reliable coding scheme (0.71 agreement between human annotators). We also provide a computational model for automatically annotating text using this coding scheme, using supervised learning enhanced by constraints implemented with Integer Linear Programming. We show that this constrained model’s analyses of speaker authority correlates very strongly with expert human judgments (r2 coefficient of 0.947).</p><p>5 0.6838457 <a title="195-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Better_Hypothesis_Testing_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation%3A_Controlling_for_Optimizer_Instability.html">60 acl-2011-Better Hypothesis Testing for Statistical Machine Translation: Controlling for Optimizer Instability</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan H. Clark ; Chris Dyer ; Alon Lavie ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: In statistical machine translation, a researcher seeks to determine whether some innovation (e.g., a new feature, model, or inference algorithm) improves translation quality in comparison to a baseline system. To answer this question, he runs an experiment to evaluate the behavior of the two systems on held-out data. In this paper, we consider how to make such experiments more statistically reliable. We provide a systematic analysis of the effects of optimizer instability—an extraneous variable that is seldom controlled for—on experimental outcomes, and make recommendations for reporting results more accurately.</p><p>6 0.4375259 <a title="195-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-An_Affect-Enriched_Dialogue_Act_Classification_Model_for_Task-Oriented_Dialogue.html">33 acl-2011-An Affect-Enriched Dialogue Act Classification Model for Task-Oriented Dialogue</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhongguo Li</p><p>Abstract: Lots of Chinese characters are very productive in that they can form many structured words either as prefixes or as suffixes. Previous research in Chinese word segmentation mainly focused on identifying only the word boundaries without considering the rich internal structures of many words. In this paper we argue that this is unsatisfying in many ways, both practically and theoretically. Instead, we propose that word structures should be recovered in morphological analysis. An elegant approach for doing this is given and the result is shown to be promising enough for encouraging further effort in this direction. Our probability model is trained with the Penn Chinese Treebank and actually is able to parse both word and phrase structures in a unified way. 1 Why Parse Word Structures? Research in Chinese word segmentation has progressed tremendously in recent years, with state of the art performing at around 97% in precision and recall (Xue, 2003; Gao et al., 2005; Zhang and Clark, 2007; Li and Sun, 2009). However, virtually all these systems focus exclusively on recognizing the word boundaries, giving no consideration to the internal structures of many words. Though it has been the standard practice for many years, we argue that this paradigm is inadequate both in theory and in practice, for at least the following four reasons. The first reason is that if we confine our definition of word segmentation to the identification of word boundaries, then people tend to have divergent 1405 opinions as to whether a linguistic unit is a word or not (Sproat et al., 1996). This has led to many different annotation standards for Chinese word segmentation. Even worse, this could cause inconsistency in the same corpus. For instance, 䉂 擌 奒 ‘vice president’ is considered to be one word in the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005), but is split into two words by the Peking University corpus in the SIGHAN Bakeoffs (Sproat and Emerson, 2003). Meanwhile, 䉂 䀓 惼 ‘vice director’ and 䉂 䚲䡮 ‘deputy are both segmented into two words in the same Penn Chinese Treebank. In fact, all these words are composed of the prefix 䉂 ‘vice’ and a root word. Thus the structure of 䉂擌奒 ‘vice president’ can be represented with the tree in Figure 1. Without a doubt, there is complete agree- manager’ NN ,,ll JJf NNf 䉂 擌奒 Figure 1: Example of a word with internal structure. ment on the correctness of this structure among native Chinese speakers. So if instead of annotating only word boundaries, we annotate the structures of every word, then the annotation tends to be more 1 1Here it is necessary to add a note on terminology used in this paper. Since there is no universally accepted definition of the “word” concept in linguistics and especially in Chinese, whenever we use the term “word” we might mean a linguistic unit such as 䉂 擌奒 ‘vice president’ whose structure is shown as the tree in Figure 1, or we might mean a smaller unit such as 擌奒 ‘president’ which is a substructure of that tree.

The second reason is applications have different requirements for granularity of words. Take the personal name 撱 嗤吼 ‘Zhou Shuren’ as an example. It’s considered to be one word in the Penn Chinese Treebank, but is segmented into a surname and a given name in the Peking University corpus. For some applications such as information extraction, the former segmentation is adequate, while for others like machine translation, the later finer-grained output is more preferable. If the analyzer can produce a structure as shown in Figure 4(a), then every application can extract what it needs from this tree. A solution with tree output like this is more elegant than approaches which try to meet the needs of different applications in post-processing (Gao et al., 2004). The third reason is that traditional word segmentation has problems in handling many phenomena in Chinese. For example, the telescopic compound 㦌 撥 怂惆 ‘universities, middle schools and primary schools’ is in fact composed ofthree coordinating elements 㦌惆 ‘university’, 撥 惆 ‘middle school’ and 怂惆 ‘primary school’ . Regarding it as one flat word loses this important information. Another example is separable words like 扩 扙 ‘swim’ . With a linear segmentation, the meaning of ‘swimming’ as in 扩 堑 扙 ‘after swimming’ cannot be properly represented, since 扩扙 ‘swim’ will be segmented into discontinuous units. These language usages lie at the boundary between syntax and morphology, and are not uncommon in Chinese. They can be adequately represented with trees (Figure 2).

The last reason why we should care about word the context will always make it clear what is being referred to with the term “word”. 1406 structures is related to head driven statistical parsers (Collins, 2003). To illustrate this, note that in the Penn Chinese Treebank, the word 戽 䊂䠽 吼 ‘English People’ does not occur at all. Hence constituents headed by such words could cause some difficulty for head driven models in which out-ofvocabulary words need to be treated specially both when they are generated and when they are conditioned upon. But this word is in turn headed by its suffix 吼 ‘people’, and there are 2,233 such words in Penn Chinese Treebank. If we annotate the structure of every compound containing this suffix (e.g. Figure 3), such data sparsity simply goes away.</p><p>3 0.16114707 <a title="66-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Automatic_Evaluation_of_Chinese_Translation_Output%3A_Word-Level_or_Character-Level%3F.html">49 acl-2011-Automatic Evaluation of Chinese Translation Output: Word-Level or Character-Level?</a></p>
<p>Author: Maoxi Li ; Chengqing Zong ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: Word is usually adopted as the smallest unit in most tasks of Chinese language processing. However, for automatic evaluation of the quality of Chinese translation output when translating from other languages, either a word-level approach or a character-level approach is possible. So far, there has been no detailed study to compare the correlations of these two approaches with human assessment. In this paper, we compare word-level metrics with characterlevel metrics on the submitted output of English-to-Chinese translation systems in the IWSLT’08 CT-EC and NIST’08 EC tasks. Our experimental results reveal that character-level metrics correlate with human assessment better than word-level metrics. Our analysis suggests several key reasons behind this finding. 1</p><p>4 0.13218476 <a title="66-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Better_Automatic_Treebank_Conversion_Using_A_Feature-Based_Approach.html">59 acl-2011-Better Automatic Treebank Conversion Using A Feature-Based Approach</a></p>

In addition, we present a comparative analysis of the data to achieve a better understanding of users’ input behaviors.

<p>Author: Nianwen Xue ; Yaqin Yang</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method for disambiguating Chinese commas that is central to Chinese sentence segmentation. Chinese sentence segmentation is viewed as the detection of loosely coordinated clauses separated by commas. Trained and tested on data derived from the Chinese Treebank, our model achieves a classification accuracy of close to 90% overall, which translates to an F1 score of 70% for detecting commas that signal sentence boundaries.</p><p>2 0.70210689 <a title="66-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Insertion%2C_Deletion%2C_or_Substitution%3F_Normalizing_Text_Messages_without_Pre-categorization_nor_Supervision.html">172 acl-2011-Insertion, Deletion, or Substitution? Normalizing Text Messages without Pre-categorization nor Supervision</a></p>
<p>Author: Fei Liu ; Fuliang Weng ; Bingqing Wang ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: Most text message normalization approaches are based on supervised learning and rely on human labeled training data. In addition, the nonstandard words are often categorized into different types and specific models are designed to tackle each type. In this paper, we propose a unified letter transformation approach that requires neither pre-categorization nor human supervision. Our approach models the generation process from the dictionary words to nonstandard tokens under a sequence labeling framework, where each letter in the dictionary word can be retained, removed, or substituted by other letters/digits. To avoid the expensive and time consuming hand labeling process, we automatically collected a large set of noisy training pairs using a novel webbased approach and performed character-level . alignment for model training. Experiments on both Twitter and SMS messages show that our system significantly outperformed the stateof-the-art deletion-based abbreviation system and the jazzy spell checker (absolute accuracy gain of 21.69% and 18. 16% over jazzy spell checker on the two test sets respectively).</p><p>3 0.64208966 <a title="66-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Machine_Translation_System_Combination_by_Confusion_Forest.html">217 acl-2011-Machine Translation System Combination by Confusion Forest</a></p>
<p>Author: Taro Watanabe ; Eiichiro Sumita</p><p>Abstract: The state-of-the-art system combination method for machine translation (MT) is based on confusion networks constructed by aligning hypotheses with regard to word similarities. We introduce a novel system combination framework in which hypotheses are encoded as a confusion forest, a packed forest representing alternative trees. The forest is generated using syntactic consensus among parsed hypotheses: First, MT outputs are parsed. Second, a context free grammar is learned by extracting a set of rules that constitute the parse trees. Third, a packed forest is generated starting from the root symbol of the extracted grammar through non-terminal rewriting. The new hypothesis is produced by searching the best derivation in the forest. Experimental results on the WMT10 system combination shared task yield comparable performance to the conventional confusion network based method with smaller space.</p><p>4 0.63830882 <a title="66-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Collecting_Highly_Parallel_Data_for_Paraphrase_Evaluation.html">72 acl-2011-Collecting Highly Parallel Data for Paraphrase Evaluation</a></p>
<p>Author: David Chen ; William Dolan</p><p>Abstract: A lack of standard datasets and evaluation metrics has prevented the field of paraphrasing from making the kind of rapid progress enjoyed by the machine translation community over the last 15 years. We address both problems by presenting a novel data collection framework that produces highly parallel text data relatively inexpensively and on a large scale. The highly parallel nature of this data allows us to use simple n-gram comparisons to measure both the semantic adequacy and lexical dissimilarity of paraphrase candidates. In addition to being simple and efficient to compute, experiments show that these metrics correlate highly with human judgments.</p><p>5 0.6296612 <a title="66-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Joint_Annotation_of_Search_Queries.html">182 acl-2011-Joint Annotation of Search Queries</a></p>

Smith Dept. of Computer Science University of Massachusetts Amherst, MA dasmith@ c s .umas s .edu articles or web pages). As previous research shows, these differences severely limit the applicability of Marking up search queries with linguistic annotations such as part-of-speech tags, capitalization, and segmentation, is an impor- tant part of query processing and understanding in information retrieval systems. Due to their brevity and idiosyncratic structure, search queries pose a challenge to existing NLP tools. To address this challenge, we propose a probabilistic approach for performing joint query annotation. First, we derive a robust set of unsupervised independent annotations, using queries and pseudo-relevance feedback. Then, we stack additional classifiers on the independent annotations, and exploit the dependencies between them to further improve the accuracy, even with a very limited amount of available training data. We evaluate our method using a range of queries extracted from a web search log. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our approach for both short keyword queries, and verbose natural language queries.</p><p>6 0.60926425 <a title="66-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Hindi_to_Punjabi_Machine_Translation_System.html">151 acl-2011-Hindi to Punjabi Machine Translation System</a></p>

<p>Author: Eyal Shnarch ; Jacob Goldberger ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing entailment at the lexical level is an important and commonly-addressed component in textual inference. Yet, this task has been mostly approached by simplified heuristic methods. This paper proposes an initial probabilistic modeling framework for lexical entailment, with suitable EM-based parameter estimation. Our model considers prominent entailment factors, including differences in lexical-resources reliability and the impacts of transitivity and multiple evidence. Evaluations show that the proposed model outperforms most prior systems while pointing at required future improvements. 1 Introduction and Background Textual Entailment was proposed as a generic paradigm for applied semantic inference (Dagan et al., 2006). This task requires deciding whether a tex- tual statement (termed the hypothesis-H) can be inferred (entailed) from another text (termed the textT). Since it was first introduced, the six rounds of the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) challenges1 , currently organized under NIST, have become a standard benchmark for entailment systems. These systems tackle their complex task at various levels of inference, including logical representation (Tatu and Moldovan, 2007; MacCartney and Manning, 2007), semantic analysis (Burchardt et al., 2007) and syntactic parsing (Bar-Haim et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009). Inference at these levels usually 1http://www.nist.gov/tac/2010/RTE/index.html 558 requires substantial processing and resources (e.g. parsing) aiming at high performance. Nevertheless, simple entailment methods, performing at the lexical level, provide strong baselines which most systems did not outperform (Mirkin et al., 2009; Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010). Within complex systems, lexical entailment modeling is an important component. Finally, there are cases in which a full system cannot be used (e.g. lacking a parser for a targeted language) and one must resort to the simpler lexical approach. While lexical entailment methods are widely used, most of them apply ad hoc heuristics which do not rely on a principled underlying framework. Typically, such methods quantify the degree of lexical coverage of the hypothesis terms by the text’s terms. Coverage is determined either by a direct match of identical terms in T and H or by utilizing lexical semantic resources, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), that capture lexical entailment relations (denoted here as entailment rules). Common heuristics for quantifying the degree of coverage are setting a threshold on the percentage coverage of H’s terms (Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010), counting absolute number of uncovered terms (Clark and Harrison, 2010), or applying an Information Retrievalstyle vector space similarity score (MacKinlay and Baldwin, 2009). Other works (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005; Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006) have applied a heuristic formula to estimate the similarity between text fragments based on a similarity function between their terms. These heuristics do not capture several important aspects of entailment, such as varying reliability of Proceedings ofP thoer t4l9atnhd A, Onrnuegaoln M,e Jeuntineg 19 o-f2 t4h,e 2 A0s1s1o.c?i ac t2io0n11 fo Ar Cssoocmiaptuiotanti foonra Clo Lminpguutiast i ocns:aslh Loirntpgaupisetrics , pages 558–563, entailment resources and the impact of rule chaining and multiple evidence on entailment likelihood. An additional observation from these and other systems is that their performance improves only moderately when utilizing lexical resources2. We believe that the textual entailment field would benefit from more principled models for various entailment phenomena. Inspired by the earlier steps in the evolution of Statistical Machine Translation methods (such as the initial IBM models (Brown et al., 1993)), we formulate a concrete generative probabilistic modeling framework that captures the basic aspects of lexical entailment. Parameter estimation is addressed by an EM-based approach, which enables estimating the hidden lexical-level entailment parameters from entailment annotations which are available only at the sentence-level. While heuristic methods are limited in their ability to wisely integrate indications for entailment, probabilistic methods have the advantage of being extendable and enabling the utilization of wellfounded probabilistic methods such as the EM algorithm. We compared the performance of several model variations to previously published results on RTE data sets, as well as to our own implementation of typical lexical baselines. Results show that both the probabilistic model and our percentagecoverage baseline perform favorably relative to prior art. These results support the viability of the probabilistic framework while pointing at certain modeling aspects that need to be improved. 2 Probabilistic Model Under the lexical entailment scope, our modeling goal is obtaining a probabilistic score for the likelihood that all H’s terms are entailed by T. To that end, we model prominent aspects of lexical entailment, which were mostly neglected by previous lexical methods: (1) distinguishing different reliability levels of lexical resources; (2) allowing transitive chains of rule applications and considering their length when estimating their validity; and (3) considering multiple entailments when entailing a term. 2See ablation tests reports in http://aclweb.org/aclwiki/ index.php?title=RTE Knowledge Resources#Ablation Tests 559 Figure 1: The generative process of entailing terms of a hypothesis from a text. Edges represent entailment rules. There are 3 evidences for the entailment of hi :a rule from Resource1 , another one from Resource3 both suggesting that tj entails it, and a chain from t1through an intermediate term t0. 2.1 Model Description For T to entail H it is usually a necessary, but not sufficient, that every term h ∈ H would be entsauiflefidci by ,at t hleatast e one t teerrmm mt h ∈ ∈T (Glickman eet al., 2006). Figure s1t odneescr tiebrmes tth ∈e process komf entailing hypothesis terms. The trivial case is when identical terms, possibly at the stem or lemma level, appear in T and H (a direct match as tn and hm in Figure 1). Alternatively, we can establish entailment based on knowledge of entailing lexical-semantic relations, such as synonyms, hypernyms and morphological derivations, available in lexical resources (e.g the rule inference → reasoning from WordNet). (We.eg d theneo rutel by R(r) cthee → resource nwgh ficroh provided teht)e. rule r. Since entailment is a transitive relation, rules may compose transitive chains that connect a term t ∈ T ctoo a pteosrme rha ∈ Hive through hinatte cromnendeicatte a tteerrmms. t ∈Fo Tr instance, fr hom ∈ t hHe r thurleosu infer → inference armnds inference → reasoning we can dre →duc inef tehreen rcuele a infer → reasoning (were inference dise dthuec ein thteerm rueldeia intef trer →m as t0 in Figure 1). Multiple chains may connect t to h (as for tj and hi in Figure 1) or connect several terms in T to h (as t1 and tj are indicating the entailment of hi in Figure 1), thus providing multiple evidence for h’s entailment. It is reasonable to expect that if a term t indeed entails a term h, it is likely to find evidences for this relation in several resources. Taking a probabilistic perspective, we assume a parameter θR for each resource R, denoting its reliability, i.e. the prior probability that applying a rule from R corresponds to a valid entailment instance. Direct matches are considered as a special “resource”, called MATCH, for which θMATCH is expected to be close to 1. We now present our probabilistic model. For a text term t ∈ T to entail a hypothesis term h by a tcehxatin te c, mde tn ∈ote Td by etn →tcai h, thhyep application mof h every r ∈ c must be valid.

The probability that T does not entail h at all (by any chain), specified in Eq. 2, is the probability that all these chains are not valid. Finally, the probability that T entails all of H, assuming independence of H’s terms, is the probability that every h ∈ H is entailed, as given ien p Eq. a3b. Nityot tihceat t ehvaet yth here ∈ c oHul ids be a term h which is not covered by any available rule chain. Under this formulation, we assume that each such h is covered by a single rule coming from a special “resource” called UNCOVERED (expecting θUNCOVERED to be relatively small). p(t −→c h) = Yp(lhs →r rhs) = Yr∈c p(T 9 h) = Y YθR(r)(1) Yr∈c [1 − p(t− →c h)] (2) c∈YC(h) p(T → H) = Y p(T → h) (3) hY∈H As can be seen, our model indeed distinguishes varying resource reliability, decreases entailment probability as rule chains grow and increases it when entailment of a term is supported by multiple chains. The above treatment of uncovered terms in H, as captured in Eq. 3, assumes that their entailment probability is independent of the rest of the hypothesis. However, when the number of covered hypothesis terms increases the probability that the remaining terms are actually entailed by T increases too 560 (even though we do not have supporting knowledge for their entailment). Thus, an alternative model is to group all uncovered terms together and estimate the overall probability of their joint entailment as a function of the lexical coverage of the hypothesis. We denote Hc as the subset of H’s terms which are covered by some rule chain and Huc as the remaining uncovered part. Eq. 3a then provides a refined entailment model for H, in which the second term specifies the probability that Huc is entailed given that Hc is validly entailed and the corresponding lengths: p(T→H) = [Yp(T→h)]·p(T→Huc hY∈Hc 2.2 | |Hc|,|H|) (3a) Parameter Estimation The difficulty in estimating the θR values is that these are term-level parameters while the RTEtraining entailment annotation is given for the sentence-level. Therefore, we use EM-based estimation for the hidden parameters (Dempster et al., 1977). In the E step we use the current θR values to compute all whcr (T, H) values for each training pair. whcr (T, H) stands for the posterior probability that application of the rule r in the chain c for h ∈ H tish valid, given nth oaft heieth reurl eT r e innta thiles c Hha or not ra hcc ∈ord Hing to the training annotation (see Eq. 4). Remember that a rule r provides an entailment relation between its left-hand-side (lhs) and its right-hand-side (rhs). Therefore Eq. 4 uses the notation lhs →r rhs to designate the application of the rule r (similar htos Eq. 1). wEhc:r(T,H)=   p (lTh9→sH−→ |rlhsrp−→ rh(Tsr→9|hTsH )9→p(lhHs−→ r) =hs)if(4T)9→H After applying Bayes’ rule we get a fraction with Eq. 3 in its denominator and θR(r) as the second term of the numerator. The first numerator term is defined as in Eq. 3 except that for the corresponding rule application we substitute θR(r) by 1(per the conditioning event). The probabilistic model defined by Eq. 1-3 is a loop-free directed acyclic graphical model (aka a Bayesian network). Hence the E-step probabilities can be efficiently calculated using the belief propagation algorithm (Pearl, 1988). The M step uses Eq. 5 to update the parameter set. For each resource R we average the whcr (T, H) val- ues for all its rule applications in the training, whose total number is denoted nR.

We also tried initializing the EM algorithm with these direct estimations but did not obtain performance improvements. 3 Evaluations and Results The 5th Recognizing Textual Entailment challenge (RTE-5) introduced a new search task (Bentivogli et al., 2009) which became the main task in RTE6 (Bentivogli et al., 2010). In this task participants should find all sentences that entail a given hypothesis in a given document cluster. This task’s data sets reflect a natural distribution of entailments in a corpus and demonstrate a more realistic scenario than the previous RTE challenges. In our system, sentences are tokenized and stripped of stop words and terms are lemmatized and tagged for part-of-speech. As lexical resources we use WordNet (WN) (Fellbaum, 1998), taking as entailment rules synonyms, derivations, hyponyms and meronyms of the first senses of T and H terms, and the CatVar (Categorial Variation) database (Habash and Dorr, 2003). We allow rule chains of length up to 4 in WordNet (WN4). We compare our model to two types of baselines: (1) RTE published results: the average of the best runs of all systems, the best and second best performing lexical systems and the best full system of each challenge; (2) our implementation of lexical 561 coverage model, tuning the percentage-of-coverage threshold for entailment on the training set. This model uses the same configuration as ourprobabilistic model. We also implemented an Information Re- trieval style baseline3 (both with and without lexical expansions), but given its poorer performance we omit its results here. Table 1 presents the results. We can see that both our implemented models (probabilistic and coverage) outperform all RTE lexical baselines on both data sets, apart from (Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010) which incorporates additional lexical resources, a named entity recognizer and a co-reference system. On RTE-5, the probabilistic model is comparable in performance to the best full system, while the coverage model achieves considerably better results. We notice that our implemented models successfully utilize resources to increase performance, as opposed to typical smaller or less consistent improvements in prior works (see Section 1).

In particular, WN4 performs better than the single-step WN only on RTE-5, suggesting the need to improve the modeling of chain- ing. The fluctuations over the data sets and impacts of resources suggest the need for further investigation over additional data sets and resources. As for the coverage model, under our configuration it poses a bigger challenge for RTE systems than perviously reported baselines. It is thus proposed as an easy to implement baseline for future entailment research. 4 Conclusions and Future Work This paper presented, for the first time, a principled and relatively rich probabilistic model for lexical entailment, amenable for estimation of hidden lexicallevel parameters from standard sentence-level annotations. The positive results of the probabilistic model compared to prior art and its ability to exploit lexical resources indicate its future potential. Yet, further investigation is needed. For example, analyzing current model’s limitations, we observed that the multiplicative nature of eqs. 1and 3 (reflecting independence assumptions) is too restrictive, resembling a logical AND. Accordingly we plan to explore relaxing this strict conjunctive behavior through models such as noisy-AND (Pearl, 1988). We also intend to explore the contribution of our model, and particularly its estimated parameter values, within a complex system that integrates multiple levels of inference.

<p>Author: Yashar Mehdad ; Matteo Negri ; Marcello Federico</p><p>Abstract: This paper explores the use of bilingual parallel corpora as a source of lexical knowledge for cross-lingual textual entailment. We claim that, in spite of the inherent difficulties of the task, phrase tables extracted from parallel data allow to capture both lexical relations between single words, and contextual information useful for inference. We experiment with a phrasal matching method in order to: i) build a system portable across languages, and ii) evaluate the contribution of lexical knowledge in isolation, without interaction with other inference mechanisms. Results achieved on an English-Spanish corpus obtained from the RTE3 dataset support our claim, with an overall accuracy above average scores reported by RTE participants on monolingual data. Finally, we show that using parallel corpora to extract paraphrase tables reveals their potential also in the monolingual setting, improving the results achieved with other sources of lexical knowledge.</p><p>4 0.16787274 <a title="144-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Jointly_Learning_to_Extract_and_Compress.html">187 acl-2011-Jointly Learning to Extract and Compress</a></p>
<p>Author: Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick ; Dan Gillick ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We learn a joint model of sentence extraction and compression for multi-document summarization. Our model scores candidate summaries according to a combined linear model whose features factor over (1) the n-gram types in the summary and (2) the compressions used. We train the model using a marginbased objective whose loss captures end summary quality. Because of the exponentially large set of candidate summaries, we use a cutting-plane algorithm to incrementally detect and add active constraints efficiently. Inference in our model can be cast as an ILP and thereby solved in reasonable time; we also present a fast approximation scheme which achieves similar performance. Our jointly extracted and compressed summaries outperform both unlearned baselines and our learned extraction-only system on both ROUGE and Pyramid, without a drop in judged linguistic quality. We achieve the highest published ROUGE results to date on the TAC 2008 data set.</p><p>5 0.1568117 <a title="144-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Typed_Graph_Models_for_Learning_Latent_Attributes_from_Names.html">314 acl-2011-Typed Graph Models for Learning Latent Attributes from Names</a></p>

<p>Author: Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan ; Jacob Goldberger</p><p>Abstract: Extensive knowledge bases ofentailment rules between predicates are crucial for applied semantic inference. In this paper we propose an algorithm that utilizes transitivity constraints to learn a globally-optimal set of entailment rules for typed predicates. We model the task as a graph learning problem and suggest methods that scale the algorithm to larger graphs. We apply the algorithm over a large data set of extracted predicate instances, from which a resource of typed entailment rules has been recently released (Schoenmackers et al., 2010). Our results show that using global transitivity information substantially improves performance over this resource and several baselines, and that our scaling methods allow us to increase the scope of global learning of entailment-rule graphs.</p><p>2 0.92071533 <a title="144-lsi-2" href="./acl-2011-A_Probabilistic_Modeling_Framework_for_Lexical_Entailment.html">22 acl-2011-A Probabilistic Modeling Framework for Lexical Entailment</a></p>
<p>Author: Eyal Shnarch ; Jacob Goldberger ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing entailment at the lexical level is an important and commonly-addressed component in textual inference. Yet, this task has been mostly approached by simplified heuristic methods. This paper proposes an initial probabilistic modeling framework for lexical entailment, with suitable EM-based parameter estimation. Our model considers prominent entailment factors, including differences in lexical-resources reliability and the impacts of transitivity and multiple evidence. Evaluations show that the proposed model outperforms most prior systems while pointing at required future improvements. 1 Introduction and Background Textual Entailment was proposed as a generic paradigm for applied semantic inference (Dagan et al., 2006). This task requires deciding whether a tex- tual statement (termed the hypothesis-H) can be inferred (entailed) from another text (termed the textT). Since it was first introduced, the six rounds of the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) challenges1 , currently organized under NIST, have become a standard benchmark for entailment systems. These systems tackle their complex task at various levels of inference, including logical representation (Tatu and Moldovan, 2007; MacCartney and Manning, 2007), semantic analysis (Burchardt et al., 2007) and syntactic parsing (Bar-Haim et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009). Inference at these levels usually 1http://www.nist.gov/tac/2010/RTE/index.html 558 requires substantial processing and resources (e.g. parsing) aiming at high performance. Nevertheless, simple entailment methods, performing at the lexical level, provide strong baselines which most systems did not outperform (Mirkin et al., 2009; Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010). Within complex systems, lexical entailment modeling is an important component. Finally, there are cases in which a full system cannot be used (e.g. lacking a parser for a targeted language) and one must resort to the simpler lexical approach. While lexical entailment methods are widely used, most of them apply ad hoc heuristics which do not rely on a principled underlying framework. Typically, such methods quantify the degree of lexical coverage of the hypothesis terms by the text’s terms. Coverage is determined either by a direct match of identical terms in T and H or by utilizing lexical semantic resources, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), that capture lexical entailment relations (denoted here as entailment rules). Common heuristics for quantifying the degree of coverage are setting a threshold on the percentage coverage of H’s terms (Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010), counting absolute number of uncovered terms (Clark and Harrison, 2010), or applying an Information Retrievalstyle vector space similarity score (MacKinlay and Baldwin, 2009). Other works (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005; Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006) have applied a heuristic formula to estimate the similarity between text fragments based on a similarity function between their terms. These heuristics do not capture several important aspects of entailment, such as varying reliability of Proceedings ofP thoer t4l9atnhd A, Onrnuegaoln M,e Jeuntineg 19 o-f2 t4h,e 2 A0s1s1o.c?i ac t2io0n11 fo Ar Cssoocmiaptuiotanti foonra Clo Lminpguutiast i ocns:aslh Loirntpgaupisetrics , pages 558–563, entailment resources and the impact of rule chaining and multiple evidence on entailment likelihood. An additional observation from these and other systems is that their performance improves only moderately when utilizing lexical resources2. We believe that the textual entailment field would benefit from more principled models for various entailment phenomena. Inspired by the earlier steps in the evolution of Statistical Machine Translation methods (such as the initial IBM models (Brown et al., 1993)), we formulate a concrete generative probabilistic modeling framework that captures the basic aspects of lexical entailment. Parameter estimation is addressed by an EM-based approach, which enables estimating the hidden lexical-level entailment parameters from entailment annotations which are available only at the sentence-level. While heuristic methods are limited in their ability to wisely integrate indications for entailment, probabilistic methods have the advantage of being extendable and enabling the utilization of wellfounded probabilistic methods such as the EM algorithm. We compared the performance of several model variations to previously published results on RTE data sets, as well as to our own implementation of typical lexical baselines. Results show that both the probabilistic model and our percentagecoverage baseline perform favorably relative to prior art. These results support the viability of the probabilistic framework while pointing at certain modeling aspects that need to be improved. 2 Probabilistic Model Under the lexical entailment scope, our modeling goal is obtaining a probabilistic score for the likelihood that all H’s terms are entailed by T. To that end, we model prominent aspects of lexical entailment, which were mostly neglected by previous lexical methods: (1) distinguishing different reliability levels of lexical resources; (2) allowing transitive chains of rule applications and considering their length when estimating their validity; and (3) considering multiple entailments when entailing a term. 2See ablation tests reports in http://aclweb.org/aclwiki/ index.php?title=RTE Knowledge Resources#Ablation Tests 559 Figure 1: The generative process of entailing terms of a hypothesis from a text. Edges represent entailment rules. There are 3 evidences for the entailment of hi :a rule from Resource1 , another one from Resource3 both suggesting that tj entails it, and a chain from t1through an intermediate term t0. 2.1 Model Description For T to entail H it is usually a necessary, but not sufficient, that every term h ∈ H would be entsauiflefidci by ,at t hleatast e one t teerrmm mt h ∈ ∈T (Glickman eet al., 2006). Figure s1t odneescr tiebrmes tth ∈e process komf entailing hypothesis terms. The trivial case is when identical terms, possibly at the stem or lemma level, appear in T and H (a direct match as tn and hm in Figure 1). Alternatively, we can establish entailment based on knowledge of entailing lexical-semantic relations, such as synonyms, hypernyms and morphological derivations, available in lexical resources (e.g the rule inference → reasoning from WordNet). (We.eg d theneo rutel by R(r) cthee → resource nwgh ficroh provided teht)e. rule r. Since entailment is a transitive relation, rules may compose transitive chains that connect a term t ∈ T ctoo a pteosrme rha ∈ Hive through hinatte cromnendeicatte a tteerrmms. t ∈Fo Tr instance, fr hom ∈ t hHe r thurleosu infer → inference armnds inference → reasoning we can dre →duc inef tehreen rcuele a infer → reasoning (were inference dise dthuec ein thteerm rueldeia intef trer →m as t0 in Figure 1). Multiple chains may connect t to h (as for tj and hi in Figure 1) or connect several terms in T to h (as t1 and tj are indicating the entailment of hi in Figure 1), thus providing multiple evidence for h’s entailment. It is reasonable to expect that if a term t indeed entails a term h, it is likely to find evidences for this relation in several resources. Taking a probabilistic perspective, we assume a parameter θR for each resource R, denoting its reliability, i.e. the prior probability that applying a rule from R corresponds to a valid entailment instance. Direct matches are considered as a special “resource”, called MATCH, for which θMATCH is expected to be close to 1. We now present our probabilistic model. For a text term t ∈ T to entail a hypothesis term h by a tcehxatin te c, mde tn ∈ote Td by etn →tcai h, thhyep application mof h every r ∈ c must be valid.

The probability that T does not entail h at all (by any chain), specified in Eq. 2, is the probability that all these chains are not valid. Finally, the probability that T entails all of H, assuming independence of H’s terms, is the probability that every h ∈ H is entailed, as given ien p Eq. a3b. Nityot tihceat t ehvaet yth here ∈ c oHul ids be a term h which is not covered by any available rule chain. Under this formulation, we assume that each such h is covered by a single rule coming from a special “resource” called UNCOVERED (expecting θUNCOVERED to be relatively small). p(t −→c h) = Yp(lhs →r rhs) = Yr∈c p(T 9 h) = Y YθR(r)(1) Yr∈c [1 − p(t− →c h)] (2) c∈YC(h) p(T → H) = Y p(T → h) (3) hY∈H As can be seen, our model indeed distinguishes varying resource reliability, decreases entailment probability as rule chains grow and increases it when entailment of a term is supported by multiple chains. The above treatment of uncovered terms in H, as captured in Eq. 3, assumes that their entailment probability is independent of the rest of the hypothesis. However, when the number of covered hypothesis terms increases the probability that the remaining terms are actually entailed by T increases too 560 (even though we do not have supporting knowledge for their entailment). Thus, an alternative model is to group all uncovered terms together and estimate the overall probability of their joint entailment as a function of the lexical coverage of the hypothesis. We denote Hc as the subset of H’s terms which are covered by some rule chain and Huc as the remaining uncovered part. Eq. 3a then provides a refined entailment model for H, in which the second term specifies the probability that Huc is entailed given that Hc is validly entailed and the corresponding lengths: p(T→H) = [Yp(T→h)]·p(T→Huc hY∈Hc 2.2 | |Hc|,|H|) (3a) Parameter Estimation The difficulty in estimating the θR values is that these are term-level parameters while the RTEtraining entailment annotation is given for the sentence-level. Therefore, we use EM-based estimation for the hidden parameters (Dempster et al., 1977). In the E step we use the current θR values to compute all whcr (T, H) values for each training pair. whcr (T, H) stands for the posterior probability that application of the rule r in the chain c for h ∈ H tish valid, given nth oaft heieth reurl eT r e innta thiles c Hha or not ra hcc ∈ord Hing to the training annotation (see Eq. 4). Remember that a rule r provides an entailment relation between its left-hand-side (lhs) and its right-hand-side (rhs). Therefore Eq. 4 uses the notation lhs →r rhs to designate the application of the rule r (similar htos Eq. 1). wEhc:r(T,H)=   p (lTh9→sH−→ |rlhsrp−→ rh(Tsr→9|hTsH )9→p(lhHs−→ r) =hs)if(4T)9→H After applying Bayes’ rule we get a fraction with Eq. 3 in its denominator and θR(r) as the second term of the numerator. The first numerator term is defined as in Eq. 3 except that for the corresponding rule application we substitute θR(r) by 1(per the conditioning event). The probabilistic model defined by Eq. 1-3 is a loop-free directed acyclic graphical model (aka a Bayesian network). Hence the E-step probabilities can be efficiently calculated using the belief propagation algorithm (Pearl, 1988). The M step uses Eq. 5 to update the parameter set. For each resource R we average the whcr (T, H) val- ues for all its rule applications in the training, whose total number is denoted nR.

We also tried initializing the EM algorithm with these direct estimations but did not obtain performance improvements. 3 Evaluations and Results The 5th Recognizing Textual Entailment challenge (RTE-5) introduced a new search task (Bentivogli et al., 2009) which became the main task in RTE6 (Bentivogli et al., 2010). In this task participants should find all sentences that entail a given hypothesis in a given document cluster. This task’s data sets reflect a natural distribution of entailments in a corpus and demonstrate a more realistic scenario than the previous RTE challenges. In our system, sentences are tokenized and stripped of stop words and terms are lemmatized and tagged for part-of-speech. As lexical resources we use WordNet (WN) (Fellbaum, 1998), taking as entailment rules synonyms, derivations, hyponyms and meronyms of the first senses of T and H terms, and the CatVar (Categorial Variation) database (Habash and Dorr, 2003). We allow rule chains of length up to 4 in WordNet (WN4). We compare our model to two types of baselines: (1) RTE published results: the average of the best runs of all systems, the best and second best performing lexical systems and the best full system of each challenge; (2) our implementation of lexical 561 coverage model, tuning the percentage-of-coverage threshold for entailment on the training set. This model uses the same configuration as ourprobabilistic model. We also implemented an Information Re- trieval style baseline3 (both with and without lexical expansions), but given its poorer performance we omit its results here. Table 1 presents the results. We can see that both our implemented models (probabilistic and coverage) outperform all RTE lexical baselines on both data sets, apart from (Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010) which incorporates additional lexical resources, a named entity recognizer and a co-reference system. On RTE-5, the probabilistic model is comparable in performance to the best full system, while the coverage model achieves considerably better results. We notice that our implemented models successfully utilize resources to increase performance, as opposed to typical smaller or less consistent improvements in prior works (see Section 1).

In particular, WN4 performs better than the single-step WN only on RTE-5, suggesting the need to improve the modeling of chain- ing. The fluctuations over the data sets and impacts of resources suggest the need for further investigation over additional data sets and resources. As for the coverage model, under our configuration it poses a bigger challenge for RTE systems than perviously reported baselines. It is thus proposed as an easy to implement baseline for future entailment research. 4 Conclusions and Future Work This paper presented, for the first time, a principled and relatively rich probabilistic model for lexical entailment, amenable for estimation of hidden lexicallevel parameters from standard sentence-level annotations. The positive results of the probabilistic model compared to prior art and its ability to exploit lexical resources indicate its future potential. Yet, further investigation is needed. For example, analyzing current model’s limitations, we observed that the multiplicative nature of eqs. 1and 3 (reflecting independence assumptions) is too restrictive, resembling a logical AND. Accordingly we plan to explore relaxing this strict conjunctive behavior through models such as noisy-AND (Pearl, 1988). We also intend to explore the contribution of our model, and particularly its estimated parameter values, within a complex system that integrates multiple levels of inference.

We claim that, in spite of the inherent difficulties of the task, phrase tables extracted from parallel data allow to capture both lexical relations between single words, and contextual information useful for inference. We experiment with a phrasal matching method in order to: i) build a system portable across languages, and ii) evaluate the contribution of lexical knowledge in isolation, without interaction with other inference mechanisms. Results achieved on an English-Spanish corpus obtained from the RTE3 dataset support our claim, with an overall accuracy above average scores reported by RTE participants on monolingual data. Finally, we show that using parallel corpora to extract paraphrase tables reveals their potential also in the monolingual setting, improving the results achieved with other sources of lexical knowledge.</p><p>6 0.44020265 <a title="144-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Typed_Graph_Models_for_Learning_Latent_Attributes_from_Names.html">314 acl-2011-Typed Graph Models for Learning Latent Attributes from Names</a></p>

<p>Author: Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan ; Jacob Goldberger</p><p>Abstract: Extensive knowledge bases ofentailment rules between predicates are crucial for applied semantic inference. In this paper we propose an algorithm that utilizes transitivity constraints to learn a globally-optimal set of entailment rules for typed predicates. We model the task as a graph learning problem and suggest methods that scale the algorithm to larger graphs. We apply the algorithm over a large data set of extracted predicate instances, from which a resource of typed entailment rules has been recently released (Schoenmackers et al., 2010). Our results show that using global transitivity information substantially improves performance over this resource and several baselines, and that our scaling methods allow us to increase the scope of global learning of entailment-rule graphs.</p><p>2 0.69532216 <a title="144-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Parsing_the_Internal_Structure_of_Words%3A_A_New_Paradigm_for_Chinese_Word_Segmentation.html">241 acl-2011-Parsing the Internal Structure of Words: A New Paradigm for Chinese Word Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongguo Li</p><p>Abstract: Lots of Chinese characters are very productive in that they can form many structured words either as prefixes or as suffixes. Previous research in Chinese word segmentation mainly focused on identifying only the word boundaries without considering the rich internal structures of many words. In this paper we argue that this is unsatisfying in many ways, both practically and theoretically. Instead, we propose that word structures should be recovered in morphological analysis. An elegant approach for doing this is given and the result is shown to be promising enough for encouraging further effort in this direction. Our probability model is trained with the Penn Chinese Treebank and actually is able to parse both word and phrase structures in a unified way. 1 Why Parse Word Structures? Research in Chinese word segmentation has progressed tremendously in recent years, with state of the art performing at around 97% in precision and recall (Xue, 2003; Gao et al., 2005; Zhang and Clark, 2007; Li and Sun, 2009). However, virtually all these systems focus exclusively on recognizing the word boundaries, giving no consideration to the internal structures of many words. Though it has been the standard practice for many years, we argue that this paradigm is inadequate both in theory and in practice, for at least the following four reasons. The first reason is that if we confine our definition of word segmentation to the identification of word boundaries, then people tend to have divergent 1405 opinions as to whether a linguistic unit is a word or not (Sproat et al., 1996). This has led to many different annotation standards for Chinese word segmentation. Even worse, this could cause inconsistency in the same corpus. For instance, 䉂 擌 奒 ‘vice president’ is considered to be one word in the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005), but is split into two words by the Peking University corpus in the SIGHAN Bakeoffs (Sproat and Emerson, 2003). Meanwhile, 䉂 䀓 惼 ‘vice director’ and 䉂 䚲䡮 ‘deputy are both segmented into two words in the same Penn Chinese Treebank. In fact, all these words are composed of the prefix 䉂 ‘vice’ and a root word. Thus the structure of 䉂擌奒 ‘vice president’ can be represented with the tree in Figure 1. Without a doubt, there is complete agree- manager’ NN ,,ll JJf NNf 䉂 擌奒 Figure 1: Example of a word with internal structure. ment on the correctness of this structure among native Chinese speakers. So if instead of annotating only word boundaries, we annotate the structures of every word, then the annotation tends to be more 1 1Here it is necessary to add a note on terminology used in this paper. Since there is no universally accepted definition of the “word” concept in linguistics and especially in Chinese, whenever we use the term “word” we might mean a linguistic unit such as 䉂 擌奒 ‘vice president’ whose structure is shown as the tree in Figure 1, or we might mean a smaller unit such as 擌奒 ‘president’ which is a substructure of that tree.

The second reason is applications have different requirements for granularity of words. Take the personal name 撱 嗤吼 ‘Zhou Shuren’ as an example. It’s considered to be one word in the Penn Chinese Treebank, but is segmented into a surname and a given name in the Peking University corpus. For some applications such as information extraction, the former segmentation is adequate, while for others like machine translation, the later finer-grained output is more preferable. If the analyzer can produce a structure as shown in Figure 4(a), then every application can extract what it needs from this tree. A solution with tree output like this is more elegant than approaches which try to meet the needs of different applications in post-processing (Gao et al., 2004). The third reason is that traditional word segmentation has problems in handling many phenomena in Chinese. For example, the telescopic compound 㦌 撥 怂惆 ‘universities, middle schools and primary schools’ is in fact composed ofthree coordinating elements 㦌惆 ‘university’, 撥 惆 ‘middle school’ and 怂惆 ‘primary school’ . Regarding it as one flat word loses this important information. Another example is separable words like 扩 扙 ‘swim’ . With a linear segmentation, the meaning of ‘swimming’ as in 扩 堑 扙 ‘after swimming’ cannot be properly represented, since 扩扙 ‘swim’ will be segmented into discontinuous units. These language usages lie at the boundary between syntax and morphology, and are not uncommon in Chinese. They can be adequately represented with trees (Figure 2).

The last reason why we should care about word the context will always make it clear what is being referred to with the term “word”. 1406 structures is related to head driven statistical parsers (Collins, 2003). To illustrate this, note that in the Penn Chinese Treebank, the word 戽 䊂䠽 吼 ‘English People’ does not occur at all. Hence constituents headed by such words could cause some difficulty for head driven models in which out-ofvocabulary words need to be treated specially both when they are generated and when they are conditioned upon. But this word is in turn headed by its suffix 吼 ‘people’, and there are 2,233 such words in Penn Chinese Treebank. If we annotate the structure of every compound containing this suffix (e.g. Figure 3), such data sparsity simply goes away.</p><p>3 0.69298697 <a title="144-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-A_Class_of_Submodular_Functions_for_Document_Summarization.html">4 acl-2011-A Class of Submodular Functions for Document Summarization</a></p>
<p>Author: Hui Lin ; Jeff Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We design a class of submodular functions meant for document summarization tasks. These functions each combine two terms, one which encourages the summary to be representative of the corpus, and the other which positively rewards diversity. Critically, our functions are monotone nondecreasing and submodular, which means that an efficient scalable greedy optimization scheme has a constant factor guarantee of optimality. When evaluated on DUC 2004-2007 corpora, we obtain better than existing state-of-art results in both generic and query-focused document summarization. Lastly, we show that several well-established methods for document summarization correspond, in fact, to submodular function optimization, adding further evidence that submodular functions are a natural fit for document summarization.</p><p>4 0.69229978 <a title="144-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Content_Models_with_Attitude.html">82 acl-2011-Content Models with Attitude</a></p>

Our model simultaneously learns a set of properties of a product and captures aggregate user sentiments towards these properties. This approach directly enables discovery of highly rated or inconsistent properties of a product. Our model admits an efficient variational meanfield inference algorithm which can be parallelized and run on large snippet collections. We evaluate our model on a large corpus of snippets from Yelp reviews to assess property and attribute prediction. We demonstrate that it outperforms applicable baselines by a considerable margin.</p><p>5 0.69026232 <a title="144-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Probabilistic_Document_Modeling_for_Syntax_Removal_in_Text_Summarization.html">251 acl-2011-Probabilistic Document Modeling for Syntax Removal in Text Summarization</a></p>
<p>Author: William M. Darling ; Fei Song</p><p>Abstract: Statistical approaches to automatic text summarization based on term frequency continue to perform on par with more complex summarization methods. To compute useful frequency statistics, however, the semantically important words must be separated from the low-content function words. The standard approach of using an a priori stopword list tends to result in both undercoverage, where syntactical words are seen as semantically relevant, and overcoverage, where words related to content are ignored. We present a generative probabilistic modeling approach to building content distributions for use with statistical multi-document summarization where the syntax words are learned directly from the data with a Hidden Markov Model and are thereby deemphasized in the term frequency statistics. This approach is compared to both a stopword-list and POS-tagging approach and our method demonstrates improved coverage on the DUC 2006 and TAC 2010 datasets using the ROUGE metric.</p><p>6 0.69023073 <a title="144-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Lexical_Normalisation_of_Short_Text_Messages%3A_Makn_Sens_a_%23twitter.html">208 acl-2011-Lexical Normalisation of Short Text Messages: Makn Sens a #twitter</a></p>

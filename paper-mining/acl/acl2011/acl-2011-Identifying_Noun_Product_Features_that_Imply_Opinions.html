<p>Author: Paula Carvalho ; Luis Sarmento ; Jorge Teixeira ; Mario J. Silva</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the expression of opinions about human entities in user-generated content (UGC). A set of 2,800 online news comments (8,000 sentences) was manually annotated, following a rich annotation scheme designed for this purpose. We conclude that the challenge in performing opinion mining in such type of content is correctly identifying the positive opinions, because (i) they are much less frequent than negative opinions and (ii) they are particularly exposed to verbal irony. We also show that the recognition of human targets poses additional challenges on mining opinions from UGC, since they are frequently mentioned by pronouns, definite descriptions and nicknames. 1</p><p>3 0.35715047 <a title="159-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Extracting_Opinion_Expressions_and_Their_Polarities_-_Exploration_of_Pipelines_and_Joint_Models.html">131 acl-2011-Extracting Opinion Expressions and Their Polarities - Exploration of Pipelines and Joint Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Johansson ; Alessandro Moschitti</p><p>Abstract: We investigate systems that identify opinion expressions and assigns polarities to the extracted expressions. In particular, we demonstrate the benefit of integrating opinion extraction and polarity classification into a joint model using features reflecting the global polarity structure. The model is trained using large-margin structured prediction methods. The system is evaluated on the MPQA opinion corpus, where we compare it to the only previously published end-to-end system for opinion expression extraction and polarity classification. The results show an improvement of between 10 and 15 absolute points in F-measure.</p><p>4 0.35252541 <a title="159-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Aspect_Ranking%3A_Identifying_Important_Product_Aspects_from_Online_Consumer_Reviews.html">45 acl-2011-Aspect Ranking: Identifying Important Product Aspects from Online Consumer Reviews</a></p>
<p>Author: Jianxing Yu ; Zheng-Jun Zha ; Meng Wang ; Tat-Seng Chua</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we dedicate to the topic of aspect ranking, which aims to automatically identify important product aspects from online consumer reviews. The important aspects are identified according to two observations: (a) the important aspects of a product are usually commented by a large number of consumers; and (b) consumers’ opinions on the important aspects greatly influence their overall opinions on the product. In particular, given consumer reviews of a product, we first identify the product aspects by a shallow dependency parser and determine consumers’ opinions on these aspects via a sentiment classifier. We then develop an aspect ranking algorithm to identify the important aspects by simultaneously considering the aspect frequency and the influence of consumers’ opinions given to each aspect on their overall opinions. The experimental results on 11 popular products in four domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We further apply the aspect ranking results to the application ofdocumentlevel sentiment classification, and improve the performance significantly.</p><p>5 0.30734098 <a title="159-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-A_Pilot_Study_of_Opinion_Summarization_in_Conversations.html">21 acl-2011-A Pilot Study of Opinion Summarization in Conversations</a></p>
<p>Author: Dong Wang ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a pilot study of opinion summarization on conversations. We create a corpus containing extractive and abstractive summaries of speaker’s opinion towards a given topic using 88 telephone conversations. We adopt two methods to perform extractive summarization. The first one is a sentence-ranking method that linearly combines scores measured from different aspects including topic relevance, subjectivity, and sentence importance. The second one is a graph-based method, which incorporates topic and sentiment information, as well as additional information about sentence-to-sentence relations extracted based on dialogue structure. Our evaluation results show that both methods significantly outperform the baseline approach that extracts the longest utterances. In particular, we find that incorporating dialogue structure in the graph-based method contributes to the improved system performance.</p><p>6 0.21049908 <a title="159-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Sentiment_Analysis_of_Citations_using_Sentence_Structure-Based_Features.html">281 acl-2011-Sentiment Analysis of Citations using Sentence Structure-Based Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Myle Ott ; Yejin Choi ; Claire Cardie ; Jeffrey T. Hancock</p><p>Abstract: Consumers increasingly rate, review and research products online (Jansen, 2010; Litvin et al., 2008). Consequently, websites containing consumer reviews are becoming targets of opinion spam. While recent work has focused primarily on manually identifiable instances of opinion spam, in this work we study deceptive opinion spam—fictitious opinions that have been deliberately written to sound authentic. Integrating work from psychology and computational linguistics, we develop and compare three approaches to detecting deceptive opinion spam, and ultimately develop a classifier that is nearly 90% accurate on our gold-standard opinion spam dataset. Based on feature analysis of our learned models, we additionally make several theoretical contributions, including revealing a relationship between deceptive opinions and imaginative writing.</p><p>5 0.82233685 <a title="159-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Aspect_Ranking%3A_Identifying_Important_Product_Aspects_from_Online_Consumer_Reviews.html">45 acl-2011-Aspect Ranking: Identifying Important Product Aspects from Online Consumer Reviews</a></p>

<p>Author: Siwei Wang ; Gina-Anne Levow</p><p>Abstract: Verbal feedback is an important information source in establishing interactional rapport. However, predicting verbal feedback across languages is challenging due to languagespecific differences, inter-speaker variation, and the relative sparseness and optionality of verbal feedback. In this paper, we employ an approach combining classifier weighting and SMOTE algorithm oversampling to improve verbal feedback prediction in Arabic, English, and Spanish dyadic conversations. This approach improves the prediction of verbal feedback, up to 6-fold, while maintaining a high overall accuracy. Analyzing highly weighted features highlights widespread use of pitch, with more varied use of intensity and duration.</p><p>3 0.78390902 <a title="159-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Hierarchical_Reinforcement_Learning_and_Hidden_Markov_Models_for_Task-Oriented_Natural_Language_Generation.html">149 acl-2011-Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning and Hidden Markov Models for Task-Oriented Natural Language Generation</a></p>
<p>Author: Nina Dethlefs ; Heriberto Cuayahuitl</p><p>Abstract: Surface realisation decisions in language generation can be sensitive to a language model, but also to decisions of content selection. We therefore propose the joint optimisation of content selection and surface realisation using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). To this end, we suggest a novel reward function that is induced from human data and is especially suited for surface realisation. It is based on a generation space in the form of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Results in terms of task success and human-likeness suggest that our unified approach performs better than greedy or random baselines.</p><p>4 0.78139049 <a title="159-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Identifying_the_Semantic_Orientation_of_Foreign_Words.html">162 acl-2011-Identifying the Semantic Orientation of Foreign Words</a></p>
<p>Author: Ahmed Hassan ; Amjad AbuJbara ; Rahul Jha ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for identifying the positive or negative semantic orientation of foreign words. Identifying the semantic orientation of words has numerous applications in the areas of text classification, analysis of product review, analysis of responses to surveys, and mining online discussions. Identifying the semantic orientation of English words has been extensively studied in literature. Most of this work assumes the existence of resources (e.g. Wordnet, seeds, etc) that do not exist in foreign languages. In this work, we describe a method based on constructing a multilingual network connecting English and foreign words. We use this network to identify the semantic orientation of foreign words based on connection between words in the same language as well as multilingual connections. The method is experimentally tested using a manually labeled set of positive and negative words and has shown very promising results.</p><p>5 0.77946776 <a title="159-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Neutralizing_Linguistically_Problematic_Annotations_in_Unsupervised_Dependency_Parsing_Evaluation.html">230 acl-2011-Neutralizing Linguistically Problematic Annotations in Unsupervised Dependency Parsing Evaluation</a></p>
<p>Author: Roy Schwartz ; Omri Abend ; Roi Reichart ; Ari Rappoport</p><p>Abstract: Dependency parsing is a central NLP task. In this paper we show that the common evaluation for unsupervised dependency parsing is highly sensitive to problematic annotations. We show that for three leading unsupervised parsers (Klein and Manning, 2004; Cohen and Smith, 2009; Spitkovsky et al., 2010a), a small set of parameters can be found whose modification yields a significant improvement in standard evaluation measures. These parameters correspond to local cases where no linguistic consensus exists as to the proper gold annotation. Therefore, the standard evaluation does not provide a true indication of algorithm quality. We present a new measure, Neutral Edge Direction (NED), and show that it greatly reduces this undesired phenomenon.</p><p>6 0.77889025 <a title="159-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-A_Class_of_Submodular_Functions_for_Document_Summarization.html">4 acl-2011-A Class of Submodular Functions for Document Summarization</a></p>

<p>Author: Jinxi Xu ; Jinying Chen</p><p>Abstract: Word alignment is a central problem in statistical machine translation (SMT). In recent years, supervised alignment algorithms, which improve alignment accuracy by mimicking human alignment, have attracted a great deal of attention. The objective of this work is to explore the performance limit of supervised alignment under the current SMT paradigm. Our experiments used a manually aligned ChineseEnglish corpus with 280K words recently released by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). We treated the human alignment as the oracle of supervised alignment. The result is surprising: the gain of human alignment over a state of the art unsupervised method (GIZA++) is less than 1point in BLEU. Furthermore, we showed the benefit of improved alignment becomes smaller with more training data, implying the above limit also holds for large training conditions. 1</p><p>3 0.20065066 <a title="265-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Model-Based_Aligner_Combination_Using_Dual_Decomposition.html">221 acl-2011-Model-Based Aligner Combination Using Dual Decomposition</a></p>
<p>Author: John DeNero ; Klaus Macherey</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised word alignment is most often modeled as a Markov process that generates a sentence f conditioned on its translation e. A similar model generating e from f will make different alignment predictions. Statistical machine translation systems combine the predictions of two directional models, typically using heuristic combination procedures like grow-diag-final. This paper presents a graphical model that embeds two directional aligners into a single model. Inference can be performed via dual decomposition, which reuses the efficient inference algorithms of the directional models. Our bidirectional model enforces a one-to-one phrase constraint while accounting for the uncertainty in the underlying directional models. The resulting alignments improve upon baseline combination heuristics in word-level and phrase-level evaluations.</p><p>4 0.17855918 <a title="265-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Reordering_with_Source_Language_Collocations.html">266 acl-2011-Reordering with Source Language Collocations</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhanyi Liu ; Haifeng Wang ; Hua Wu ; Ting Liu ; Sheng Li</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel reordering model for statistical machine translation (SMT) by means of modeling the translation orders of the source language collocations. The model is learned from a word-aligned bilingual corpus where the collocated words in source sentences are automatically detected. During decoding, the model is employed to softly constrain the translation orders of the source language collocations, so as to constrain the translation orders of those source phrases containing these collocated words. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the translation quality, achieving the absolute improvements of 1.1~1.4 BLEU score over the baseline methods. 1</p><p>5 0.17416279 <a title="265-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Bayesian_Word_Alignment_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">57 acl-2011-Bayesian Word Alignment for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Coskun Mermer ; Murat Saraclar</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we compare the translation performance of word alignments obtained via Bayesian inference to those obtained via expectation-maximization (EM). We propose a Gibbs sampler for fully Bayesian inference in IBM Model 1, integrating over all possible parameter values in finding the alignment distribution. We show that Bayesian inference outperforms EM in all of the tested language pairs, domains and data set sizes, by up to 2.99 BLEU points. We also show that the proposed method effectively addresses the well-known rare word problem in EM-estimated models; and at the same time induces a much smaller dictionary of bilingual word-pairs. .t r</p><p>6 0.1646961 <a title="265-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Gappy_Phrasal_Alignment_By_Agreement.html">141 acl-2011-Gappy Phrasal Alignment By Agreement</a></p>

<p>Author: Mohit Bansal ; Chris Quirk ; Robert Moore</p><p>Abstract: We propose a principled and efficient phraseto-phrase alignment model, useful in machine translation as well as other related natural language processing problems. In a hidden semiMarkov model, word-to-phrase and phraseto-word translations are modeled directly by the system. Agreement between two directional models encourages the selection of parsimonious phrasal alignments, avoiding the overfitting commonly encountered in unsupervised training with multi-word units. Expanding the state space to include “gappy phrases” (such as French ne ? pas) makes the alignment space more symmetric; thus, it allows agreement between discontinuous alignments. The resulting system shows substantial improvements in both alignment quality and translation quality over word-based Hidden Markov Models, while maintaining asymptotically equivalent runtime.</p><p>3 0.69233972 <a title="265-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-How_Much_Can_We_Gain_from_Supervised_Word_Alignment%3F.html">152 acl-2011-How Much Can We Gain from Supervised Word Alignment?</a></p>

<p>Author: Graham Neubig ; Taro Watanabe ; Eiichiro Sumita ; Shinsuke Mori ; Tatsuya Kawahara</p><p>Abstract: We present an unsupervised model for joint phrase alignment and extraction using nonparametric Bayesian methods and inversion transduction grammars (ITGs). The key contribution is that phrases of many granularities are included directly in the model through the use of a novel formulation that memorizes phrases generated not only by terminal, but also non-terminal symbols. This allows for a completely probabilistic model that is able to create a phrase table that achieves competitive accuracy on phrase-based machine translation tasks directly from unaligned sentence pairs. Experiments on several language pairs demonstrate that the proposed model matches the accuracy of traditional two-step word alignment/phrase extraction approach while reducing the phrase table to a fraction of the original size.</p><p>6 0.65883791 <a title="265-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Dealing_with_Spurious_Ambiguity_in_Learning_ITG-based_Word_Alignment.html">93 acl-2011-Dealing with Spurious Ambiguity in Learning ITG-based Word Alignment</a></p>

We address this problem in a classification approach that includes features that model those two characteristics.

For each type of post, in the second phase, we exploit different strategies, including opinion analysis, response pair identification, and response relevancy detection, to summarize and highlight critical information to display.

<p>Author: Emmanuel Prochasson ; Pascale Fung</p><p>Abstract: We present a first known result of high precision rare word bilingual extraction from comparable corpora, using aligned comparable documents and supervised classification. We incorporate two features, a context-vector similarity and a co-occurrence model between words in aligned documents in a machine learning approach. We test our hypothesis on different pairs of languages and corpora. We obtain very high F-Measure between 80% and 98% for recognizing and extracting correct translations for rare terms (from 1to 5 occurrences). Moreover, we show that our system can be trained on a pair of languages and test on a different pair of languages, obtaining a F-Measure of 77% for the classification of Chinese-English translations using a training corpus of Spanish-French. Our method is therefore even potentially applicable to low resources languages without training data.</p><p>6 0.63585567 <a title="265-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Scaling_up_Automatic_Cross-Lingual_Semantic_Role_Annotation.html">269 acl-2011-Scaling up Automatic Cross-Lingual Semantic Role Annotation</a></p>

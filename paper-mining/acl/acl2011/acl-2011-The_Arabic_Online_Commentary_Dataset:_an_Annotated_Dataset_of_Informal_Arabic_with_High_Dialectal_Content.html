</p><p>7 1 Introduction  The Arabic language is characterized by an interesting linguistic dichotomy, whereby the written form of the language, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), differs in a non-trivial fashion from the various spoken varieties of Arabic. [sent-10, score-0.059]
</p><p>8 As the variant of choice for written and official communication, MSA content significantly dominates dialectal content, and in turn MSA dominates in datasets available for linguistic research, especially in textual form. [sent-11, score-0.768]
</p><p>9 The abundance of MSA data has greatly aided research on computational methods applied to Arabic, but only the MSA variant of it. [sent-12, score-0.044]

</p><p>15 1 Granted, it is conceivable that processing dialectal content is more difficult than MSA, but the main problem is the lack of dialectal training data. [sent-83, score-1.174]
</p><p>16 2 In this paper, we present our efforts to create a dataset of dialectal Arabic, the Arabic Online Commentary Dataset, by extracting reader commentary from the online versions of three Arabic newspapers, which have a high degree (about half) of dialectal content (Levantine, Gulf, and Egyptian). [sent-84, score-1.448]
</p><p>17 Furthermore, we describe a long-term crowdsourced effort to have the sentences labeled by Arabic speakers for the level of dialect in each sentence and the dialect itself. [sent-85, score-1.092]
</p><p>18 Finally, we present experimental results on the task of automatic dialect classification  with systems trained on the collected dialect labels. [sent-86, score-0.961]
</p><p>19 2It can in fact be argued that MSA is the variant with the more complex sentence structure and richer morphology. [sent-88, score-0.044]

</p><p>21 2  The AOC Dataset  Arabic is the official language in over 20 countries,  spoken by more than 250 million people. [sent-93, score-0.062]
</p><p>22 The official status only refers to a written form of Arabic known as Modern StandardArabic (MSA). [sent-94, score-0.049]
</p><p>23 The spoken dialects of Arabic (Figure 2) differ quite a bit from MSA and from each other. [sent-95, score-0.16]
</p><p>24 The dominance of MSA in available Arabic text makes dialectal Arabic datasets hard to come by. [sent-96, score-0.585]
</p><p>25 3 We set out to create a dataset of dialectal Arabic to address this need. [sent-97, score-0.652]
</p><p>26 The most viable resource of dialectal Arabic text is online data, which is more individual-driven and less institutionalized, and therefore more likely to contain dialectal content. [sent-98, score-1.185]
</p><p>27 Possible sources of dialectal text include weblogs, forums, and chat transcripts. [sent-99, score-0.593]
</p><p>28 However, weblogs usually contain relatively little data, and a writer might use dialect in their writing only occasionaly, forums usually have content that is of little interest or relevance to actual applications, and chat transcripts are difficult to obtain and extract. [sent-100, score-0.6]
</p><p>29 We instead diverted our attention to online commentary by readers of online content. [sent-101, score-0.211]
</p><p>30 This source of data has several advantages: •  A large amount of data, with more data becoming argveail aamboleu on a daily b waistihs. [sent-102, score-0.022]

</p><p>32 •  A  high  le  3The problem is somewhat mitigated in the speech domain, since dialectal data exists in the form of phone conversations and television program recordings. [sent-105, score-0.632]
</p><p>33 The Arabic Online Commentary dataset that we  created was based on reader commentary from the online versions of three Arabic newspapers: AlGhad from Jordan, Al-Riyadh from Saudi Arabia, and Al-Youm Al-Sabe’ from Egypt. [sent-112, score-0.25]
</p><p>34 4 The common dialects in those countries are Levantine, Gulf, and Egyptian, respectively. [sent-113, score-0.112]
</p><p>35 We crawled webpages corresponding to articles published during a roughly-6-month period, covering early April 2010 to early October 2010. [sent-114, score-0.066]
</p><p>36 5  The AOC dataset (and the dialect labels of Sec-  tion 3) is fully documented and publicly available. [sent-126, score-0.553]
</p><p>37 The release also includes all sentences from articles in the 150K crawled webpages. [sent-138, score-0.071]
</p><p>38 3  Augmenting the AOC with Dialect Labels  We have started an ongoing effort to have each sentence in the AOC dataset labeled with dialect labels. [sent-139, score-0.586]
</p><p>39 For each sentence, we would like to know whether or not it has dialectal content, how much dialect there is, and which variant of Arabic it is. [sent-140, score-1.077]
</p><p>40 Having those labels would greatly aid researchers interested in dialect by helping them focus on the sentences identified as having dialectal content. [sent-141, score-1.121]
</p><p>41 1 Amazon’s Mechanical Turk The dialect labeling task requires knowledge of Arabic at a native level. [sent-143, score-0.491]
</p><p>42 1M available sentences, we selected a ‘small’ subset of 142,530 sentences to be labeled by MTurk Workers. [sent-147, score-0.064]
</p><p>43 7 We kept the annotation instructions relatively simple, augmenting them with the map from Figure 2 (with the Arabic names of the dialects) to illustrate the different dialect classes. [sent-148, score-0.509]
</p><p>44 The sentences were randomly grouped into 14,253 sets of 10 sentences each. [sent-149, score-0.086]
</p><p>45 When a Worker chooses to perform our task, they are shown the 10 sentences of some random set, on a single HTML page. [sent-150, score-0.043]
</p><p>46 For each sentence, they indicate the level of dialectal Arabic, and which dialect it is (if any). [sent-151, score-1.033]
</p><p>47 05 per screen, and request each one be completed by three distinct Workers. [sent-153, score-0.036]
</p><p>48 3 Quality Control To ensure high annotation quality, we insert two additional control sentences into each screen, taken from the article bodies. [sent-155, score-0.087]
</p><p>49 Hence, a careless Worker can be easily identified if they label many control sentences as having dialect in them. [sent-157, score-0.531]
</p><p>50 7There are far fewer sentences available from Al-Ghad than the other two sources (fourth line of Table 1). [sent-158, score-0.043]
</p><p>51 We have taken this imbalance into accout and heavily oversampled Al-Ghad sentences when choosing sentences to be labeled. [sent-159, score-0.086]
</p><p>52 For instance, within the sentences from Al-Youm Al-Sabe ’, most sentences judged as having dialectal content should be clas-  sified as Egyptian. [sent-162, score-0.713]
</p><p>53 A similar strong prior exists for Levantine within Al-Ghad sentences, and for Gulf within Al-Riyadh sentences. [sent-163, score-0.02]
</p><p>54 Using those two criteria, there is a very clear distinction between Workers who are faithful and those who are not (mostly spammers), and 13. [sent-164, score-0.019]
</p><p>55 4  Dataset Statistics  We have been collecting labels from MTurk for a period of about four and a half months. [sent-167, score-0.06]
</p><p>56 In that period, 11,03 1 HITs were performed to completion (corresponding to 110,3 10 sentences, each labeled by three distinct annotators). [sent-168, score-0.021]
</p><p>57 Overall, 455 annotators took part, 63 of whom judged at least 50 screens. [sent-169, score-0.053]
</p><p>58 Our most prolific annotator completed over 6,000 screens, with the top 25 annotators supplying about 80% of the labels, and the top 50 annotators supplying about 90% of the labels. [sent-170, score-0.191]
</p><p>59 We consider a sentence to be dialectal if it is labeled as such by at least two annotators. [sent-171, score-0.588]
</p><p>60 For a small set of sentences (2%),  no such agreement existed, and those sentences were discarded (they are mostly sentences identified as being non-Arabic). [sent-173, score-0.147]

</p><p>63 4  Automatic Dialect Classification  One can think of dialect classification  as a lan-  guage identification task, and techniques for language identification can be applied to dialect classification. [sent-179, score-1.035]
</p><p>64 We use the collected labels to investigate how well a machine learner can distinguish dialectal Arabic from MSA, and how well it can distinguish between the different Arabic dialects. [sent-180, score-0.593]
</p><p>65 In a classification task with c classes, we build c language models, one per class. [sent-182, score-0.029]
</p><p>66 We find that it is quite good at distinguishing each dialect from the corresponding MSA content, and distinguishing the dialects from each other. [sent-188, score-0.571]
</p><p>67 We should note that, in practice, accuracy is probably not as important of a measure as (dialect) precision, since we are mainly interested in identifying dialectal data, and much less so MSA data. [sent-189, score-0.567]
</p><p>68 To that  end, one can significantly increase the precision rate (at the expense of recall, naturally) by biasing classification towards MSA, and choosing the dialectal label only if the ratio of the two LM scores exceeds a certain threshold. [sent-190, score-0.596]

</p><p>72 The work of Irvine and Klementiev (2010) is similar to ours in spirit, as they too use MTurk to find annotators with relatively uncommon linguistic skills, to create translation lexicons between English and 42 rare languages. [sent-198, score-0.095]
</p><p>73 In the same vein, Zaidan and Callison-Burch (201 1) solicit English translations of Urdu sentences from non-professional translators, and show that translation quality can rival that of professionals, for a fraction of the cost. [sent-199, score-0.063]
</p><p>74 Lei and Hansen (201 1) build Gaussian mixture models to identify the same three dialects we consider, and are able to achieve an accuracy rate of 71. [sent-200, score-0.087]

</p><p>77 In a four-way classification task (with Iraqi as a fourth dialect), they achieve a 78. [sent-204, score-0.029]
</p><p>78 It must be noted that both works use speech data, and that dialect identification is done on the speaker level, not the sentence level as we do. [sent-206, score-0.524]
</p><p>79 6  Current and Future Work  Wehave alreadyutilizedthe dialectlabels toidentify dialectal sentences to be translated into English, in an effort to create a Dialectal Arabic-to-English parallel dataset (also taking a crowdsourcing approach) to aid machine translation of dialectal Arabic. [sent-207, score-1.366]
</p><p>80 Given the recent political unrest in the Middle East (early 201 1), another rich source of dialectal Arabic are Twitter posts (e. [sent-208, score-0.617]

In the current study, we report efforts to partially fill this gap. We present a newly developed manually annotated corpus ofModern Standard Arabic (MSA) together with a new polarity lexicon.The corpus is a collection of newswire documents annotated on the sentence level. We also describe an automatic SSA tagging system that exploits the annotated data. We investigate the impact of different levels ofpreprocessing settings on the SSA classification task. We show that by explicitly accounting for the rich morphology the system is able to achieve significantly higher levels of performance.</p><p>6 0.12178604 <a title="299-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Automatic_Headline_Generation_using_Character_Cross-Correlation.html">51 acl-2011-Automatic Headline Generation using Character Cross-Correlation</a></p>

<p>Author: Omar F. Zaidan ; Chris Callison-Burch</p><p>Abstract: The written form of Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), differs quite a bit from the spoken dialects of Arabic, which are the true “native” languages of Arabic speakers used in daily life. However, due to MSA’s prevalence in written form, almost all Arabic datasets have predominantly MSA content. We present the Arabic Online Commentary Dataset, a 52M-word monolingual dataset rich in dialectal content, and we describe our long-term annotation effort to identify the dialect level (and dialect itself) in each sentence of the dataset. So far, we have labeled 108K sentences, 41% of which as having dialectal content.

<p>Author: Fahad Alotaiby</p><p>Abstract: Arabic language is a morphologically complex language. Affixes and clitics are regularly attached to stems which make direct comparison between words not practical. In this paper we propose a new automatic headline generation technique that utilizes character cross-correlation to extract best headlines and to overcome the Arabic language complex morphology. The system that uses character cross-correlation achieves ROUGE-L score of 0. 19384 while the exact word matching scores only 0. 17252 for the same set of documents. 1</p><p>4 0.69753635 <a title="299-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Using_Deep_Morphology_to_Improve_Automatic_Error_Detection_in_Arabic_Handwriting_Recognition.html">329 acl-2011-Using Deep Morphology to Improve Automatic Error Detection in Arabic Handwriting Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Nizar Habash ; Ryan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Arabic handwriting recognition (HR) is a challenging problem due to Arabic’s connected letter forms, consonantal diacritics and rich morphology. In this paper we isolate the task of identification of erroneous words in HR from the task of producing corrections for these words. We consider a variety of linguistic (morphological and syntactic) and non-linguistic features to automatically identify these errors. Our best approach achieves a roughly ∼15% absolute increase in F-score aov reoru ag hsliym ∼pl1e5 b%ut a rbesaoslounteab inlec breaasseeli inne.

<p>Author: Yuval Marton ; Nizar Habash ; Owen Rambow</p><p>Abstract: We explore the contribution of morphological features both lexical and inflectional to dependency parsing of Arabic, a morphologically rich language. Using controlled experiments, we find that definiteness, person, number, gender, and the undiacritzed lemma are most helpful for parsing on automatically tagged input. We further contrast the contribution of form-based and functional features, and show that functional gender and number (e.g., “broken plurals”) and the related rationality feature improve over form-based features. It is the first time functional morphological features are used for Arabic NLP. – –</p><p>6 0.52769643 <a title="299-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Subjectivity_and_Sentiment_Analysis_of_Modern_Standard_Arabic.html">289 acl-2011-Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis of Modern Standard Arabic</a></p>

<p>Author: Jeffrey Heinz ; Chetan Rawal ; Herbert G. Tanner</p><p>Abstract: Beginning with Goldsmith (1976), the phonological tier has a long history in phonological theory to describe non-local phenomena. This paper defines a class of formal languages, the Tier-based Strictly Local languages, which begin to describe such phenomena. Then this class is located within the Subregular Hierarchy (McNaughton and Papert, 1971). It is found that these languages contain the Strictly Local languages, are star-free, are incomparable with other known sub-star-free classes, and have other interesting properties.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.75040948 <a title="299-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-The_Arabic_Online_Commentary_Dataset%3A_an_Annotated_Dataset_of_Informal_Arabic_with_High_Dialectal_Content.html">299 acl-2011-The Arabic Online Commentary Dataset: an Annotated Dataset of Informal Arabic with High Dialectal Content</a></p>

<p>Author: Nguyen Bach ; Fei Huang ; Yaser Al-Onaizan</p><p>Abstract: State-of-the-art statistical machine translation (MT) systems have made significant progress towards producing user-acceptable translation output. However, there is still no efficient way for MT systems to inform users which words are likely translated correctly and how confident it is about the whole sentence. We propose a novel framework to predict wordlevel and sentence-level MT errors with a large number of novel features. Experimental results show that the MT error prediction accuracy is increased from 69.1 to 72.2 in F-score. The Pearson correlation between the proposed confidence measure and the human-targeted translation edit rate (HTER) is 0.6. Improve- ments between 0.4 and 0.9 TER reduction are obtained with the n-best list reranking task using the proposed confidence measure. Also, we present a visualization prototype of MT errors at the word and sentence levels with the objective to improve post-editor productivity.</p><p>5 0.59378016 <a title="299-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Collecting_Highly_Parallel_Data_for_Paraphrase_Evaluation.html">72 acl-2011-Collecting Highly Parallel Data for Paraphrase Evaluation</a></p>
<p>Author: David Chen ; William Dolan</p><p>Abstract: A lack of standard datasets and evaluation metrics has prevented the field of paraphrasing from making the kind of rapid progress enjoyed by the machine translation community over the last 15 years. We address both problems by presenting a novel data collection framework that produces highly parallel text data relatively inexpensively and on a large scale. The highly parallel nature of this data allows us to use simple n-gram comparisons to measure both the semantic adequacy and lexical dissimilarity of paraphrase candidates. In addition to being simple and efficient to compute, experiments show that these metrics correlate highly with human judgments.</p><p>6 0.4976325 <a title="299-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Unsupervised_Semantic_Role_Induction_via_Split-Merge_Clustering.html">324 acl-2011-Unsupervised Semantic Role Induction via Split-Merge Clustering</a></p>

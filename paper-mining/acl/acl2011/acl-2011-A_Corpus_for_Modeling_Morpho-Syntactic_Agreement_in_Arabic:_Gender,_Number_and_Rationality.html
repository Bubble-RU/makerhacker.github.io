</p><p>5 1 Introduction Arabic morphology is complex, partly because of its richness, and partly because of its complex morphosyntactic agreement rules which depend on features not necessarily expressed in word forms, such as lexical rationality and functional gender and number. [sent-6, score-1.228]
</p><p>6 In this paper, we present an enriched version of the Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB, part 3) (Maamouri et al. [sent-7, score-0.049]

</p><p>8 This resource is important for building computational models of Arabic morphology and syntax that account for morpho-syntactic agreement patterns. [sent-10, score-0.267]
</p><p>9 Section 4 describes our annotation process and Section 5 presents an analysis of the annotated corpus. [sent-14, score-0.057]
</p><p>10 357 2  Linguistic Facts  Arabic has a rich and complex morphology. [sent-21, score-0.041]
</p><p>11 This paper focuses on two specific issues of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) nominal  morphology involving the features of gender and number only: the discrepancy between morphological form and function and the complex system of morpho-syntactic agreement. [sent-23, score-0.589]
</p><p>12 nouns, proper nouns and adjectives) and verbs inflect for gender: masculine (M) and feminine (F), and for number: singular (S), dual (D) and plural (P). [sent-27, score-0.416]
</p><p>13 These features are typically realized using a small set of suffixes that uniquely convey gen? [sent-28, score-0.065]
</p><p>14 For a sizable minority of words, these features are expressed templatically, i. [sent-51, score-0.03]
</p><p>15 A typical example of this phenomenon is the class of broken 2Arabic transliteration is presented in the Habash-Soudi-  ý  Buckwalter (HSB) scheme (Habash et al. [sent-54, score-0.076]

</p><p>20 2 Morpho-syntactic Agreement Arabic gender and number features participate in morpho-syntactic agreement within specific constructions such as nouns and their adjectives and verbs and their subjects. [sent-115, score-0.703]
</p><p>21 Arabic agreement rules are more complex than the simple matching rules found in languages such as French or Spanish (Holes, 2004; Habash, 2010). [sent-116, score-0.371]
</p><p>22 First, Arabic adjectives agree with the nouns they modify in gender and number except for plural irrational (non-human) nouns, which always take feminine singular adjectives. [sent-117, score-0.754]
</p><p>23 mktbAt ‘libraries’ the adjective  ‘new’  (FFPPI) take  as H? [sent-124, score-0.036]
</p><p>24 There are nouns that are semantically rational/human but not morpho-syntactically, e. [sent-134, score-0.108]
</p><p>25 6 Second, verbs and their nominal subjects have the same rules as nouns and their adjectives, except that,  4This nomenclature denotes (FuFnocrtmion). [sent-140, score-0.26]
</p><p>26 5We specify rationality as part of the functional features of the word. [sent-141, score-0.552]
</p><p>27 The values of this feature are: rational (R), irrational (I), and not-applicable (N). [sent-142, score-0.106]
</p><p>28 N is assigned to verbs, adjectives, numbers and quantifiers. [sent-143, score-0.035]
</p><p>29 358 Figure 1: An example of a dependency tree with formbased and functional morphology features  (FuFnocrtmion). [sent-162, score-0.348]

</p><p>31 mAhrwn  MMPPN  ‘clever’  additionally, verbs in verb-subject (VSO) order only agree in gender and default to singular number. [sent-200, score-0.456]
</p><p>32 Third, number quantification has unique rules (Dada, 2007), e. [sent-210, score-0.069]
</p><p>33 , numbers over 10 always take a singular noun, while numbers 3 to 10 take a plural noun and inversely agree with the noun’s func? [sent-212, score-0.255]

</p><p>35 xms ¯h (FFSSN) TlAb (MMPSR) ‘five [male] students’  and Ø? [sent-224, score-0.138]
</p><p>36 Finally, although the rules described above are  generally followed, there are numerous exceptions that can typically be explained as some form of figure of speech involving elision or overridden rationality/irrationality. [sent-235, score-0.069]
</p><p>37 jyš (MMSSI) ‘army’ can take the rational MP agreement in an elided reference to its members. [sent-241, score-0.237]
</p><p>38 7Reverse gender agreement can be modeled as a formfunction discrepancy, although it is typically not discussed as such in Arabic grammar. [sent-242, score-0.489]
</p><p>39 3  Related Work  Much work has been done on Arabic computational morphology (Al-Sughaiyer and Al-Kharashi, 2004; Soudi et al. [sent-243, score-0.075]
</p><p>40 However, the bulk of this work does not address formfunction discrepancy or morpho-syntactic agreement issues. [sent-245, score-0.33]
</p><p>41 Smrž (2007b)’s work contrasting illusory (form) features and functional features inspired our distinction of morphological form and function. [sent-254, score-0.317]
</p><p>42 His ElixirFM analyzer (Smrž, 2007a) extends BAMA by including functional number and some functional gender information, but not rationality. [sent-256, score-0.689]
</p><p>43 This analyzer was used as part ofthe annotation ofthe Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank (PADT) (Smrž and Haji cˇ, 2006). [sent-257, score-0.101]
</p><p>44 In the work presented here, we annotate for all three features completely in the PATB and we present a quantitative analysis of morphosyntactic agreement patterns in it. [sent-258, score-0.358]
</p><p>45 (2008) presented an automatic cue-based algorithm that uses bilingual and monolingual cues to build a web-extracted lexicon enriched with gender, number and rationality features. [sent-260, score-0.374]
</p><p>46 Unlike them, we annotate the PATB manually exploiting existing PATB information to help annotate efficiently and accurately. [sent-263, score-0.088]
</p><p>47 359 tokens are already diacritized and lemma/part-ofspeech (POS) disambiguated manually. [sent-270, score-0.046]
</p><p>48 Since verbs are regular in their form-to-function mapping, we annotate them automatically. [sent-271, score-0.087]
</p><p>49 Nominals account for almost half of all tokens (∼ 197K tokens). [sent-272, score-0.081]
</p><p>50 2  Annotation Simplification  To simplify the annotation task, we made the following decisions. [sent-276, score-0.057]
</p><p>51 First, we decided to annotate nominals out of context except for the use of their lemmas and POS tags, which were already assigned manually in context in the PATB. [sent-277, score-0.297]
</p><p>52 The intuition here  being that the functional features we are after are not contextually variable. [sent-278, score-0.227]
</p><p>53 Second, we normalized the case/state-variant forms of the number/gender suffixes and removed the definite article proclitic. [sent-280, score-0.076]
</p><p>54 The normalized forms preserve the most important information for our task: the stem of the word and the number/gender suffix. [sent-282, score-0.041]
</p><p>55 Of all nouns, adjectives and proper nouns, around 4. [sent-284, score-0.125]
</p><p>56 2% (types) have no lemmas (annotated as DEFAULT, TBupdate, or nolemma). [sent-286, score-0.122]
</p><p>57 The annotation speed averaged about 675 –  (words/lemmas) per hour. [sent-292, score-0.057]
</p><p>58 3  Annotation Guidelines  We summarize the annotation guidelines here due to space restrictions. [sent-294, score-0.098]
</p><p>59 Full guidelines will be presented in a future publication. [sent-295, score-0.041]
</p><p>60 The core annotation task involves assigning the correct functional gender, number and rationality to nominals. [sent-296, score-0.579]
</p><p>61 The annotators were given word clusters each of which consisting of a lemma and all of its simplified inflected forms appearing in the PATB. [sent-300, score-0.095]
</p><p>62 Annotators were asked to assign the rationality feature to the lemma only; and the gender and number features to the inflected forms. [sent-302, score-0.66]
</p><p>63 As for rationality, adjectives receive a default N and everything else gets I. [sent-304, score-0.115]
</p><p>64 The guidelines explained the form-function discrepancy problem, and the various morpho-syntactic agreement rules (Section 2) were given as tests to allow the annotators to make correct decisions. [sent-305, score-0.394]
</p><p>65 4 Inter-Annotator Agreement We computed inter-annotator agreement (IAA) over a random set of 397 lemma clusters with 509 word types corresponding to 4,781 tokens. [sent-308, score-0.246]
</p><p>66 The typebased IAA scores for words with known lemmas are 93. [sent-309, score-0.122]
</p><p>67 Based on these scores, the number features is the easiest to annotate, followed by gender and rationality. [sent-324, score-0.281]
</p><p>68 This is explainable by the fact that number in Arabic is always expressed morphologically through affix or stem change, while gender is more lexical, and rationality is completely lexical. [sent-325, score-0.576]
</p><p>69 90 The difference caused by missing lemmas highlights the need and value for complete annotations in the  PATB. [sent-339, score-0.122]
</p><p>70 9The rationality value B is used for cases with lemma ambiguity, e. [sent-342, score-0.379]
</p><p>71 360 5  Corpus Analysis  We present a quantitative analysis of the annotated corpus focusing on the issues that motivated it. [sent-350, score-0.044]
</p><p>72 1 Form-Function Similarity Patterns Table 1 summarizes the different combinations of form-function values of gender, number and rationality for nominals in our corpus. [sent-352, score-0.456]
</p><p>73 Broken plurals (PS) are almost 55%  of all plurals. [sent-363, score-0.14]
</p><p>74 5% of proper nouns are singular, which means that rationality is effectively irrelevant for proper nouns as a feature, since it is only relevant morpho-syntactically with plurals. [sent-365, score-0.633]
</p><p>75 Although the great majority of nouns are irrational, proper nouns tend to be almost equally split between rational and irrational. [sent-366, score-0.342]
</p><p>76 In terms of gender and number (jointly), 85% of all nominals have matching form and function values, with adjective having the highest ratio, followed by nouns and then proper nouns. [sent-367, score-0.572]
</p><p>77 2 Morpho-syntactic Agreement Patterns We focus on three agreement classes: NounAdj(ective), Verb-Subject (VSO and SVO orders) and Number-Noun (multiple configurations). [sent-369, score-0.192]
</p><p>78 The total number of relevant bigrams is 39,561 or almost 11. [sent-373, score-0.035]
</p><p>79 For each agreement class, we compare using a simple agreement rule (parent and child values match) with using an implementation of the complex agreement  rules summarized in Section 2. [sent-376, score-0.686]
</p><p>80 We also compare using form-based features or functional Table 2 presents the percentage of bigrams we determine to agree (i. [sent-377, score-0.263]
</p><p>81 10  10Simple agreement between parent and child in gender alone is 83. [sent-381, score-0.443]
</p><p>82 The drop in the last number is due to broken plurals. [sent-387, score-0.076]
</p><p>83 form-based gender and number agreement between parent and child is only 66. [sent-417, score-0.443]
</p><p>84 Using functional values, the simple gender and number agreement moves only to 68. [sent-419, score-0.64]
</p><p>85 Introducing complex agreement rules with form-based values (using the default N value for rationality of adjectives and I other for classes) increases grammaticality scores to 80. [sent-421, score-0.742]
</p><p>86 However, with using both functional morphology features and complex agreement rules, the grammaticality score jumps to 93. [sent-423, score-0.535]
</p><p>87 These results validate the need for both functional features and complex agreement rules in Arabic. [sent-425, score-0.529]
</p><p>88 3 Manual Analysis of Agreement Problems The cases we considered ungrammatical when applying complex agreement rules with functional features above add up to 2,540 instances. [sent-427, score-0.529]
</p><p>89 About 50% of all problems are the result of human annotation errors. [sent-429, score-0.057]
</p><p>90 Almost two-thirds of these errors involve incorrect rationality assignment and almost one-third involved incorrect gender. [sent-430, score-0.36]
</p><p>91 2864 Table 2: Analysis of gender+number agreement patterns in the annotated corpus. [sent-438, score-0.192]
</p><p>92 Structure and POS tags are almost equal in their contribution. [sent-441, score-0.035]
</p><p>93 The rest of the agreement problems (∼30%) are the result of special rules or figures-of-speech %th)aatr are enorets hualtnodflesdp. [sent-442, score-0.261]
</p><p>94 The most common cases of unhandled rules include not modeling conjunctions, which affect number agreement, followed by gender-number invariable forms of some adjectives. [sent-445, score-0.11]
</p><p>95 After this error analysis, we identified 379 lemmas involved in incorrect rationalityaffected agreement (as per our rules). [sent-446, score-0.314]
</p><p>96 All of these cases had a PI features but did not agreed as FS. [sent-447, score-0.03]
</p><p>97 6  Conclusions and Future Work  We presented a large resource enriched with latent features necessary for modeling morpho-syntactic agreement in Arabic. [sent-452, score-0.271]
</p><p>98 In future work, we plan to use both corpus annotations and agreement rules to automatically learn functional features for unseen words and detect and correct annotation errors. [sent-453, score-0.545]
</p><p>99 We also  plan to extend agreement rules to include complex structures beyond bigrams. [sent-454, score-0.302]

<p>Author: Omar F. Zaidan ; Chris Callison-Burch</p><p>Abstract: The written form of Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), differs quite a bit from the spoken dialects of Arabic, which are the true “native” languages of Arabic speakers used in daily life. However, due to MSA’s prevalence in written form, almost all Arabic datasets have predominantly MSA content. We present the Arabic Online Commentary Dataset, a 52M-word monolingual dataset rich in dialectal content, and we describe our long-term annotation effort to identify the dialect level (and dialect itself) in each sentence of the dataset. So far, we have labeled 108K sentences, 41% of which as having dialectal content. We also present experimental results on the task of automatic dialect identification, using the collected labels for training and evaluation.</p><p>5 0.19110093 <a title="7-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Subjectivity_and_Sentiment_Analysis_of_Modern_Standard_Arabic.html">289 acl-2011-Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis of Modern Standard Arabic</a></p>

In the current study, we report efforts to partially fill this gap. We present a newly developed manually annotated corpus ofModern Standard Arabic (MSA) together with a new polarity lexicon.The corpus is a collection of newswire documents annotated on the sentence level. We also describe an automatic SSA tagging system that exploits the annotated data. We investigate the impact of different levels ofpreprocessing settings on the SSA classification task. We show that by explicitly accounting for the rich morphology the system is able to achieve significantly higher levels of performance.</p><p>6 0.15323062 <a title="7-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Automatic_Headline_Generation_using_Character_Cross-Correlation.html">51 acl-2011-Automatic Headline Generation using Character Cross-Correlation</a></p>

<p>Author: Omar F. Zaidan ; Chris Callison-Burch</p><p>Abstract: The written form of Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), differs quite a bit from the spoken dialects of Arabic, which are the true “native” languages of Arabic speakers used in daily life. However, due to MSA’s prevalence in written form, almost all Arabic datasets have predominantly MSA content. We present the Arabic Online Commentary Dataset, a 52M-word monolingual dataset rich in dialectal content, and we describe our long-term annotation effort to identify the dialect level (and dialect itself) in each sentence of the dataset. So far, we have labeled 108K sentences, 41% of which as having dialectal content. We also present experimental results on the task of automatic dialect identification, using the collected labels for training and evaluation.</p><p>3 0.84243089 <a title="7-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-Improving_Arabic_Dependency_Parsing_with_Form-based_and_Functional_Morphological_Features.html">164 acl-2011-Improving Arabic Dependency Parsing with Form-based and Functional Morphological Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Nizar Habash ; Ryan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Arabic handwriting recognition (HR) is a challenging problem due to Arabic’s connected letter forms, consonantal diacritics and rich morphology. In this paper we isolate the task of identification of erroneous words in HR from the task of producing corrections for these words. We consider a variety of linguistic (morphological and syntactic) and non-linguistic features to automatically identify these errors. Our best approach achieves a roughly ∼15% absolute increase in F-score aov reoru ag hsliym ∼pl1e5 b%ut a rbesaoslounteab inlec breaasseeli inne.

<p>Author: Fahad Alotaiby</p><p>Abstract: Arabic language is a morphologically complex language. Affixes and clitics are regularly attached to stems which make direct comparison between words not practical. In this paper we propose a new automatic headline generation technique that utilizes character cross-correlation to extract best headlines and to overcome the Arabic language complex morphology. The system that uses character cross-correlation achieves ROUGE-L score of 0. 19384 while the exact word matching scores only 0. 17252 for the same set of documents. 1</p><p>6 0.63877535 <a title="7-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Subjectivity_and_Sentiment_Analysis_of_Modern_Standard_Arabic.html">289 acl-2011-Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis of Modern Standard Arabic</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael Subotin</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an exponential model for translation into highly inflected languages which can be scaled to very large datasets. As in other recent proposals, it predicts targetside phrases and can be conditioned on sourceside context. However, crucially for the task of modeling morphological generalizations, it estimates feature parameters from the entire training set rather than as a collection of separate classifiers. We apply it to English-Czech translation, using a variety of features capturing potential predictors for case, number, and gender, and one of the largest publicly available parallel data sets. We also describe generation and modeling of inflected forms unobserved in training data and decoding procedures for a model with non-local target-side feature dependencies.</p><p>4 0.51356041 <a title="7-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Unsupervised_Semantic_Role_Induction_via_Split-Merge_Clustering.html">324 acl-2011-Unsupervised Semantic Role Induction via Split-Merge Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Joel Lang ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we describe an unsupervised method for semantic role induction which holds promise for relieving the data acquisition bottleneck associated with supervised role labelers. We present an algorithm that iteratively splits and merges clusters representing semantic roles, thereby leading from an initial clustering to a final clustering of better quality. The method is simple, surprisingly effective, and allows to integrate linguistic knowledge transparently. By combining role induction with a rule-based component for argument identification we obtain an unsupervised end-to-end semantic role labeling system. Evaluation on the CoNLL 2008 benchmark dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms competitive unsupervised approaches by a wide margin.</p><p>5 0.46665359 <a title="7-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Template-Based_Information_Extraction_without_the_Templates.html">293 acl-2011-Template-Based Information Extraction without the Templates</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathanael Chambers ; Dan Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: Standard algorithms for template-based information extraction (IE) require predefined template schemas, and often labeled data, to learn to extract their slot fillers (e.g., an embassy is the Target of a Bombing template). This paper describes an approach to template-based IE that removes this requirement and performs extraction without knowing the template structure in advance. Our algorithm instead learns the template structure automatically from raw text, inducing template schemas as sets of linked events (e.g., bombings include detonate, set off, and destroy events) associated with semantic roles. We also solve the standard IE task, using the induced syntactic patterns to extract role fillers from specific documents. We evaluate on the MUC-4 terrorism dataset and show that we induce template structure very similar to handcreated gold structure, and we extract role fillers with an F1 score of .40, approaching the performance of algorithms that require full knowledge of the templates.</p><p>6 0.45692316 <a title="7-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Using_Deep_Morphology_to_Improve_Automatic_Error_Detection_in_Arabic_Handwriting_Recognition.html">329 acl-2011-Using Deep Morphology to Improve Automatic Error Detection in Arabic Handwriting Recognition</a></p>

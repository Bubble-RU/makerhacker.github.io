<p>Author: Amitava Das ; Sivaji Bandyopadhyay</p><p>Abstract: Sentiment analysis is one of the hot demanding research areas since last few decades. Although a formidable amount of research have been done, the existing reported solutions or available systems are still far from perfect or do not meet the satisfaction level of end users’ . The main issue is the various conceptual rules that govern sentiment and there are even more clues (possibly unlimited) that can convey these concepts from realization to verbalization of a human being. Human psychology directly relates to the unrevealed clues and governs the sentiment realization of us. Human psychology relates many things like social psychology, culture, pragmatics and many more endless intelligent aspects of civilization. Proper incorporation of human psychology into computational sentiment knowledge representation may solve the problem. In the present paper we propose a template based online interactive gaming technology, called Dr Sentiment to automatically create the PsychoSentiWordNet involving internet population.

<p>Author: Sharon Gower Small ; Jennifer Strommer-Galley ; Tomek Strzalkowski</p><p>Abstract: We describe an annotation tool developed to assist in the creation of multimodal actioncommunication corpora from on-line massively multi-player games, or MMGs. MMGs typically involve groups of players (5-30) who control their perform various activities (questing, competing, fighting, etc.) and communicate via chat or speech using assumed screen names. We collected a corpus of 48 group quests in Second Life that jointly involved 206 players who generated over 30,000 messages in quasisynchronous chat during approximately 140 hours of recorded action. Multiple levels of coordinated annotation of this corpus (dialogue, movements, touch, gaze, wear, etc) are required in order to support development of automated predictors of selected real-life social and demographic characteristics of the players. The annotation tool presented in this paper was developed to enable efficient and accurate annotation of all dimensions simultaneously. avatars1, 1</p><p>5 0.089261398 <a title="207-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Prototyping_virtual_instructors_from_human-human_corpora.html">252 acl-2011-Prototyping virtual instructors from human-human corpora</a></p>

In this paper we present a novel algorithm for rapidly prototyping virtual instructors from human-human corpora without manual annotation. Automatically prototyping full-fledged dialogue systems from corpora is far from being a reality nowadays. Our algorithm is restricted in that only the virtual instructor can perform speech acts while the user responses are limited to physical actions in the virtual world. We evaluate a virtual instructor, generated using this algorithm, with human users. We compare our results both with human instructors and rule-based virtual instructors hand-coded for the same task.</p><p>6 0.069881856 <a title="207-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Entrainment_in_Speech_Preceding_Backchannels..html">118 acl-2011-Entrainment in Speech Preceding Backchannels.</a></p>

<p>Author: Ulrich Schafer ; Bernd Kiefer ; Christian Spurk ; Jorg Steffen ; Rui Wang</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel application for structured search in scientific digital libraries. The ACL Anthology Searchbench is meant to become a publicly available research tool to query the content of the ACL Anthology. The application provides search in both its bibliographic metadata and semantically analyzed full textual content. By combining these two features, very efficient and focused queries are possible. At the same time, the application serves as a showcase for the recent progress in natural language processing (NLP) research and language technology. The system currently indexes the textual content of 7,500 anthology papers from 2002–2009 with predicateargument-like semantic structures. It also provides useful search filters based on bibliographic metadata. It will be extended to provide the full anthology content and en- . hanced functionality based on further NLP techniques. 1 Introduction and Motivation Scientists in all disciplines nowadays are faced with a flood of new publications every day. In addition, more and more publications from the past become digitally available and thus even increase the amount. Finding relevant information and avoiding duplication of work have become urgent issues to be addressed by the scientific community. The organization and preservation of scientific knowledge in scientific publications, vulgo text documents, thwarts these efforts. From a viewpoint of 7 dfki .de / lt a computer scientist, scientific papers are just ‘unstructured information’ . At least in our own scientific community, Computational Linguistics, it is generally assumed that NLP could help to support search in such document collections. The ACL Anthology1 is a comprehensive elec- tronic collection of scientific papers in our own field (Bird et al., 2008). It is updated regularly with new publications, but also older papers have been scanned and are made available electronically. We have implemented the ACL Anthology Searchbench2 for two reasons: Our first aim is to provide a more targeted search facility in this collection than standard web search on the anthology website. In this sense, the Searchbench is meant to become a service to our own community. Our second motivation is to use the developed system as a showcase for the progress that has been made over the last years in precision-oriented deep linguistic parsing in terms of both efficiency and coverage, specifically in the context of the DELPHIN community3. Our system also uses further NLP techniques such as unsupervised term extraction, named entity recognition and part-of-speech (PoS) tagging. By automatically precomputing normalized semantic representations (predicate-argument structure) of each sentence in the anthology, the search space is structured and allows to find equivalent or related predicates even if they are expressed differ- 1http : / /www . aclweb .org/ anthology 2http : //aclasb . dfki . de 3http : / /www . de lph-in . net – DELPH-IN stands for DEep Linguistic Processing with HPSG INitiative.

In addition, the Searchbench also provides detailed bibliographic metadata for filtering as well as autosuggest texts for input fields computed from the corpus two further key features one can expect from such systems today, nevertheless very important for efficient search in digital libraries. We describe the offline preprocessing and deep parsing approach in Section 2. Section 3 concentrates on the generation of the semantic search index. In Section 4, we describe the search interface. We conclude in Section 5 and present an outlook to future extensions. – 2 Parsing the ACL Anthology The basis of the search index for the ACL Anthology are its original PDF documents, currently 8,200 from the years 2002 through 2009. To overcome quality problems in text extraction from PDF, we use a commercial PDF extractor based on OCR techniques. This approach guarantees uniform and highquality textual representations even from older papers in the anthology (before 2000) which mostly were scanned from printed paper versions. The general idea of the semantics-oriented access to scholarly paper content is to parse each sentence they contain with the open-source HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994) grammar for English (ERG; Flickinger (2002)) and then distill and index semantically structured representations for search. To make the deep parser robust, it is embedded in a NLP workflow. The coverage (percentage of full deeply parsed sentences) on the anthology corpus could be increased from 65 % to now more than 85 % through careful combination of several robustness techniques; for example: (1) chart pruning, directed search during parsing to increase per- formance, and also coverage for longer sentences (Cramer and Zhang, 2010); (2) chart mapping, a novel method for integrating preprocessing information in exactly the way the deep grammar expects it (Adolphs et al., 2008); (3) new version of the ERG with better handling of open word classes; (4) 8 more fine-grained named entity recognition, including recognition of citation patterns; (5) new, better suited parse ranking model (WeScience; Flickinger et al. (2010)). Because of limited space, we will focus on (1) and (2) below. A more detailed description and further results are available in (Sch a¨fer and Kiefer, 2011). Except for a small part of the named entity recognition components (citations, some terminology) and the parse ranking model, there are no further adaptations to genre or domain of the text corpus. This implies that the NLP workflow could be easily and modularly adapted to other (scientific or nonscientific) domains—mainly thanks to the generic and comprehensive language modelling in the ERG. The NLP preprocessing component workflow is implemented using the Heart of Gold NLP middleware architecture (Sch a¨fer, 2006). It starts with sentence boundary detection (SBR) and regular expression-based tokenization using its built-in component JTok, followed by the trigram-based PoS tagger TnT (Brants, 2000) trained on the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and the named entity recognizer SProUT (Dro z˙d z˙y n´ski et al., 2004). 2.1 Precise Preprocessing Integration with Chart Mapping Tagger output is combined with information from the named entity recognizer, e.g. delivering hypothetical information on citation expressions. The combined result is delivered as input to the deep parser PET (Callmeier, 2000) running the ERG. Here, citations, for example, can be treated as either persons, locations or appositions. Concerning punctuation, the ERG can make use of information on opening and closing quotation marks. Such information is often not explicit in the input text, e.g. when, as in our setup, gained through OCR which does not distinguish between ‘ and ’ or “ and However, a tokenizer can often guess (recon- ”. struct) leftness and rightness correctly. This information, passed to the deep parser via chart mapping, helps it to disambiguate. 2.2 Increased Processing Speed and Coverage through Chart Pruning In addition to a well-established discriminative maximum entropy model for post-analysis parse selection, we use an additional generative model as described in Cramer and Zhang (2010) to restrict the search space during parsing. This restriction increases efficiency, but also coverage, because the parse time was restricted to at most 60 CPU seconds on a standard PC, and more sentences could now be parsed within these bounds. A 4 GB limit for main memory consumption was far beyond what was ever needed. We saw a small but negligible decrease in parsing accuracy, 5.4 % best parses were not found due to the pruning of important chart edges. Ninomiya et al. (2006) did a very thorough comparison ofdifferent performance optimization strategies, and among those also a local pruning strategy similar to the one used here. There is an important difference between the systems, in that theirs works on a reduced context-free backbone first and reconstructs the results with the full grammar, while PET uses the HPSG grammar directly, with subsumption packing and partial unpacking to achieve a similar effect as the packed chart of a context-free parser. sentence length −→ Figure 1: Distribution of sentence length and mean parse times for mild pruning In total, we parsed 1,537,801 sentences, of which 57,832 (3.8 %) could not be parsed because of lexicon errors. Most of them were caused by OCR ar- tifacts resulting in unexpected punctuation character combinations. These can be identified and will be deleted in the future. Figure 1 displays the average parse time of processing with a mild chart pruning setting, together with the mean quadratic error. In addition, it contains the distribution of input sentences over sentence length. Obviously, the vast majority of sen9 tences has a length of at most 60 words4. The parse times only grow mildly due to the many optimization techniques in the original system, and also the new chart pruning method. The sentence length distribution has been integrated into Figure 1 to show that the predominant part of our real-world corpus can be processed using this information-rich method with very low parse times (overall average parse time < 2 s per sentence). The large amount of short inputs is at first surprising, even more so that most of these inputs can not be parsed. Most of these inputs are non-sentences such as headings, enumerations, footnotes, table cell content. There are several alternatives to deal with such input, one to identify and handle them in a preprocessing step, another to use a special root condition in the deep analysis component that is able to combine phrases with well-defined properties for inputs where no spanning result could be found. We employed the second method, which has the advantage that it handles a larger range of phenomena in a homogeneous way. Figure 2 shows the change in percentage of unparsed and timed out inputs for the mild pruning method with and without the root condition combining fragments. sentence length −→ Figure 2: Unparsed and timed out sentences with and without fragment combination Figure 2 shows that this changes the curve for unparsed sentences towards more expected characteristics and removes the uncommonly high percentage of short sentences for which no parse can be computed. Together with the parses for fragmented 4It has to be pointed out that extremely long sentences also may be non-sentences resulting from PDF extraction errors, missing punctuation etc. No manual correction took place. Figure 3: Multiple semantic tuples may be generated for a sentence input, we get a recall (sentences with at least one parse) over the whole corpus of 85.9 % (1,321,336 sentences), without a significant change for any of the other measures, and with potential for further improvement. 3 Semantic Tuple Extraction with DMRS In contrast to shallow parsers, the ERG not only handles detailed syntactic analyses of phrases, com- pounds, coordination, negation and other linguistic phenomena that are important for extracting semantic relations, but also generates a formal semantic representation of the meaning of the input sentence in the Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) representation format (Copestake et al., 2005). It consists of elementary predications for each word and larger constituents, connected via argument positions and variables, from which predicate-argument structure can be extracted. MRS representations resulting from deep parsing are still relatively close to linguistic structures and contain more detailed information than a user would like to query and search for. Therefore, an additional extraction and abstraction step is performed before storing semantic structures in the search index. Firstly, MRS is converted to DMRS (Copestake, 2009), a dependency-style version of MRS that eases extraction of predicate-argument structure using the implementation in LKB (Copestake, 2002). The representation format we devised for the search index we call semantic tuples, in fact quintuples</p><p>2 0.8270151 <a title="207-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Coreference_Resolution_with_World_Knowledge.html">85 acl-2011-Coreference Resolution with World Knowledge</a></p>

Hence, it is not clear whether these benefits can carry over to a stronger baseline. Moreover, since there has been no attempt to apply different sources of world knowledge in combination to coreference resolution, it is not clear whether they offer complementary benefits to a resolver. We systematically compare commonly-used and under-investigated sources of world knowledge for coreference resolution by applying them to two learning-based coreference models and evaluating them on documents annotated with two different annotation schemes.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.78519726 <a title="207-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Learning_to_Win_by_Reading_Manuals_in_a_Monte-Carlo_Framework.html">207 acl-2011-Learning to Win by Reading Manuals in a Monte-Carlo Framework</a></p>

<p>Author: Oscar Tackstrom ; Ryan McDonald</p><p>Abstract: We derive two variants of a semi-supervised model for fine-grained sentiment analysis. Both models leverage abundant natural supervision in the form of review ratings, as well as a small amount of manually crafted sentence labels, to learn sentence-level sentiment classifiers. The proposed model is a fusion of a fully supervised structured conditional model and its partially supervised counterpart. This allows for highly efficient estimation and inference algorithms with rich feature definitions. We describe the two variants as well as their component models and verify experimentally that both variants give significantly improved results for sentence-level sentiment analysis compared to all baselines. 1 Sentence-level sentiment analysis In this paper, we demonstrate how combining coarse-grained and fine-grained supervision benefits sentence-level sentiment analysis an important task in the field of opinion classification and retrieval (Pang and Lee, 2008). Typical supervised learning approaches to sentence-level sentiment analysis rely on sentence-level supervision. While such fine-grained supervision rarely exist naturally, and thus requires labor intensive manual annotation effort (Wiebe et al., 2005), coarse-grained supervision is naturally abundant in the form of online review ratings. This coarse-grained supervision is, of course, less informative compared to fine-grained supervision, however, by combining a small amount of sentence-level supervision with a large amount of document-level supervision, we are able to substantially improve on the sentence-level classification task. Our work combines two strands of research: models for sentiment analysis that take document structure into account; – 569 Ryan McDonald Google, Inc., New York ryanmcd@ google com . and models that use latent variables to learn unobserved phenomena from that which can be observed. Exploiting document structure for sentiment analysis has attracted research attention since the early work of Pang and Lee (2004), who performed minimal cuts in a sentence graph to select subjective sentences. McDonald et al. (2007) later showed that jointly learning fine-grained (sentence) and coarsegrained (document) sentiment improves predictions at both levels. More recently, Yessenalina et al. (2010) described how sentence-level latent variables can be used to improve document-level prediction and Nakagawa et al. (2010) used latent variables over syntactic dependency trees to improve sentence-level prediction, using only labeled sentences for training. In a similar vein, Sauper et al. (2010) integrated generative content structure models with discriminative models for multi-aspect sentiment summarization and ranking. These approaches all rely on the availability of fine-grained annotations, but Ta¨ckstro¨m and McDonald (201 1) showed that latent variables can be used to learn fine-grained sentiment using only coarse-grained supervision. While this model was shown to beat a set of natural baselines with quite a wide margin, it has its shortcomings. Most notably, due to the loose constraints provided by the coarse supervision, it tends to only predict the two dominant fine-grained sentiment categories well for each document sentiment category, so that almost all sentences in positive documents are deemed positive or neutral, and vice versa for negative documents. As a way of overcoming these shortcomings, we propose to fuse a coarsely supervised model with a fully supervised model. Below, we describe two ways of achieving such a combined model in the framework of structured conditional latent variable models. Contrary to (generative) topic models (Mei et al., 2007; Titov and Proceedings ofP thoer t4l9atnhd A, Onrnuegaoln M,e Jeuntineg 19 o-f2 t4h,e 2 A0s1s1o.c?i ac t2io0n11 fo Ar Cssoocmiaptuiotanti foonra Clo Lminpguutiast i ocns:aslh Loirntpgaupisetrics , pages 569–574, Figure 1: a) Factor graph of the fully observed graphical model. b) Factor graph of the corresponding latent variable model. During training, shaded nodes are observed, while non-shaded nodes are unobserved. The input sentences si are always observed. Note that there are no factors connecting the document node, yd, with the input nodes, s, so that the sentence-level variables, ys, in effect form a bottleneck between the document sentiment and the input sentences. McDonald, 2008; Lin and He, 2009), structured conditional models can handle rich and overlapping features and allow for exact inference and simple gradient based estimation. The former models are largely orthogonal to the one we propose in this work and combining their merits might be fruitful. As shown by Sauper et al. (2010), it is possible to fuse generative document structure models and task specific structured conditional models. While we do model document structure in terms of sentiment transitions, we do not model topical structure. An interesting avenue for future work would be to extend the model of Sauper et al. (2010) to take coarse-grained taskspecific supervision into account, while modeling fine-grained task-specific aspects with latent variables. Note also that the proposed approach is orthogonal to semi-supervised and unsupervised induction of context independent (prior polarity) lexicons (Turney, 2002; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2009; Rao and Ravichandran, 2009; Velikovich et al., 2010). The output of such models could readily be incorporated as features in the proposed model. 1.1 Preliminaries Let d be a document consisting of n sentences, s = (si)in=1, with a document–sentence-sequence pair denoted d = (d, s). Let yd = (yd, ys) denote random variables1 the document level sentiment, yd, and the sequence of sentence level sentiment, = (ysi)in=1 . – ys 1We are abusing notation throughout by using the same symbols to refer to random variables and their particular assignments. 570 In what follows, we assume that we have access to two training sets: a small set of fully labeled instances, DF = {(dj, and a large set of ydj)}jm=f1, coarsely labeled instances DC = {(dj, yjd)}jm=fm+fm+c1. Furthermore, we assume that yd and all yis take values in {POS, NEG, NEU}.

<p>Author: Renxian Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In summarization, sentence ordering is conducted to enhance summary readability by accommodating text coherence. We propose a grouping-based ordering framework that integrates local and global coherence concerns. Summary sentences are grouped before ordering is applied on two levels: group-level and sentence-level. Different algorithms for grouping and ordering are discussed. The preliminary results on single-document news datasets demonstrate the advantage of our method over a widely accepted method. 1 Introduction and Background The canonical pipeline of text summarization consists of topic identification, interpretation, and summary generation (Hovy, 2005). In the simple case of extraction, topic identification and interpretation are conflated to sentence selection and concerned with summary informativeness. In . comparison, summary generation addresses summary readability and a frequently discussed generation technique is sentence ordering. It is implicitly or explicitly stated that sentence ordering for summarization is primarily driven by coherence. For example, Barzilay et al. (2002) use lexical cohesion information to model local coherence. A statistical model by Lapata (2003) considers both lexical and syntactic features in calculating local coherence. More globally biased is Barzilay and Lee’s (2004) HMM-based content model, which models global coherence with word distribution patterns. Whilst the above models treat coherence as lexical or topical relations, Barzilay and Lapata (2005, 2008) explicitly model local coherence with an entity grid model trained for optimal syntactic role transitions of entities. 6 . polyu .edu .hk Although coherence in those works is modeled in the guise of “lexical cohesion”, “topic closeness”, “content relatedness”, etc., few published works simultaneously accommodate coherence on the two levels: local coherence and global coherence, both of which are intriguing topics in text linguistics and psychology. For sentences, local coherence means the wellconnectedness between adjacent sentences through lexical cohesion (Halliday and Hasan, 1976) or entity repetition (Grosz et al., 1995) and global coherence is the discourse-level relation connecting remote sentences (Mann and Thompson, 1995; Kehler, 2002). An abundance of psychological evidences show that coherence on both levels is manifested in text comprehension (Tapiero, 2007). Accordingly, an apt sentence ordering scheme should be driven by such concerns. We also note that as sentence ordering is usually discussed only in the context of multi-document summarization, factors other than coherence are also considered, such as time and source sentence position in Bollegala et al.’s (2006) “agglomerative ordering” approach. But it remains an open question whether sentence ordering is non-trivial for single-document summarization, as it has long been recognized as an actual strategy taken by human summarizers (Jing, 1998; Jing and McKeown, 2000) and acknowledged early in work on sentence ordering for multi-document summarization (Barzilay et al., 2002). In this paper, we outline a grouping-based sentence ordering framework that is driven by the concern of local and global coherence. Summary sentences are grouped according to their conceptual relatedness before being ordered on two levels: group-level ordering and sentence-level ordering, which capture global coherence and local coherence in an integrated model. As a preliminary study, we applied the framework to singlePortland, ORP,r UoSceAed 1i9ng-2s4 of Ju tnhee 2 A0C1L1-H. ?Lc T2 0201111 A Ssstuodcieanttio Snes fsoiro Cn,o pmapguesta 6t–io1n1a,l Linguistics document summary generation and obtained interesting results. The main contributions of this work are: (1) we stress the need to channel sentence ordering research to linguistic and psychological findings about text coherence; (2) we propose a groupingbased ordering framework that integrates both local and global coherence; (3) we find in experiments that coherence-driven sentence ordering improves the readability of singledocument summaries, for which sentence ordering is often considered trivial. In Section 2, we review related ideas and techniques in previous work. Section 3 provides the details of grouping-based sentence ordering. The preliminary experimental results are presented in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes the whole paper and describes future work. 2 Grouping-Based Ordering Our ordering framework is designed to capture both local and global coherence. Globally, we identify related groups among sentences and find their relative order. Locally, we strive to keep sentence similar or related in content close to each other within one group. 2.1 Sentence Representation As summary sentences are isolated from their original context, we retain the important content information by representing sentences as concept vectors. In the simplest case, the “concept” is equivalent to content word. A drawback of this practice is that it considers every content word equally contributive to the sentence content, which is not always true. For example, in the news domain, entities realized as NPs are more important than other concepts. To represent sentences as entity vectors, we identify both common entities (as the head nouns of NPs) and named entities. Two common entities are equivalent if their noun stems are identical or synonymous. Named entities are usually equated by identity. But in order to improve accuracy, we also consider: 1) structural subsumption (one is part of another); 2) hypernymy and holonymy (the named entities are in a superordinate-subordinate or part-whole relation). Now with summary sentence Si and m entities eik (k = 1 m), Si = (wf(ei1), wf(ei2), wf(eim)), … … … … … …, 7 where wf(eik) = wk× ×f(eik), f(eik) is the frequency of eik and wk is the weight of eik. We define wk = 1 if eik is a common entity and wk = 2 if eik is a named entity. We give double weight to named entities because of their significance to news articles. After all, a news story typically contains events, places, organizations, people, etc. that denote the news theme. Other things being equal, two sentences sharing a mention of named entities are thematically closer than two sentences sharing a mention of common entities. Alternatively, we can realize the “concept” as “event” because events are prevalent semantic constructs that bear much of the sentence content in some domains (e.g., narratives and news reports). To represent sentences as event vectors, we can follow Zhang et al.’s (2010) method at the cost of more complexity. 2.2 Sentence Grouping To meet the global need of identifying sentence groups, we develop two grouping algorithms by applying graph-based operation and clustering. Connected Component Finding (CC) This algorithm treats grouping sentences as finding connected components (CC) in a text graph TG = (V, E), where V represents the sentences and E the sentence relations weighted by cosine similarity. Edges with weight < t, a threshold, are removed because they represent poor sentence coherence. The resultant graph may be disconnected, in which we find all of its connected components, using depth-first search. The connected components are the groups we are looking for. Note that this method cannot guarantee that every two sentences in such a group are directly linked, but it does guarantee that there exists a path between every sentence pair. Modified K-means Clustering (MKM) Observing that the CC method finds only coherent groups, not necessarily groups of coherent sentences, we develop a second algorithm using clustering. A good choice might be K-means as it is efficient and outperforms agglomerative clustering methods in NLP applications (Steibach et al., 2000), but the difficulty with the conventional K-means is the decision of K. Our solution is modified K-means (MKM) based on (Wilpon and Rabiner, 1985). Let’s denote cluster iby CLi and cluster similarity by Sim(CLi) =SimM,SiinnCLi(Sim( Sim,Sin)), where Sim( Sim,Sin)is their cvMeluin231st.(roCWSD21imLsdhtoIf(=ClaSehbLsimt)l1;(zehS<-amncs,tdoeSa1vn)c;st:el=uMionvrate(lhcSKiosmg-tC;eblLayn)s,c2riuegant wcoelsunathdi cosine. The following illustrates the algorithm. The above algorithm stops iterating when each cluster contains all above-threshold-similarity sentence pairs or only one sentence. Unlike CC, MKM results in more strongly connected groups, or groups of coherence sentences. 2.3 Ordering Algorithms After the sentences are grouped, ordering is to be conducted on two levels: group and sentence. Composed of closely related sentences, groups simulate high-level textual constructs, such as “central event”, “cause”, “effect”, “background”, etc. for news articles, around which sentences are generated for global coherence. For an intuitive example, all sentences about “cause” should immediately precede all sentences about “effect” to achieve optimal readability. We propose two approaches to group-level ordering. 1) If the group sentences come from the same document, group (Gi) order is decided by the group-representing sentence (gi) order ( means “precede”) in the text. gi gj  Gi Gj 2) Group order is decided in a greedy fashion in order to maximize the connectedness between adjacent groups, thus enhancing local coherence. Each time a group is selected to achieve maximum similarity with the ordered groups and the first ordered group (G1) is selected to achieve maximum similarity with all the other groups.

Similarly, we propose two approaches. 1) If the sentences come from the same document, they are arranged by the text order. 2) Sentence order is greedily decided.

But there is no theoretical proof that it leads to optimal global and local coherence that concerns us. On some occasions, e.g., a news article adopting the “Wall Street Journal Formula” (Rich and Harper, 2007) where conceptually related sentences are placed at the beginning and the end, sentence conceptual relatedness does not necessarily correlate with spatial proximity and thus selected sentences may need to be rearranged for better readability. We are not aware of any published work that has empirically compared alternative ways of sentence ordering for singledocument summarization. The experimental results reported below may draw some attention to this taken-for-granted issue. 3.1 Data and Method We prepared 3 datasets of 60 documents each, the first (D400) consisting of documents of about 400 words from the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) 01/02 datasets; the second (D1k) consisting of documents of about 1000 words manually selected from popular English journals such as The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, etc; the third (D2k) consisting of documents of about 2000 words from the DUC 01/02 dataset. Then we generated 100-word summaries for D400 and 200-word summaries for D1k and D2k. Since sentence selection is not our focus, the 180 summaries were all extracts produced by a simple but robust summarizer built on term frequency and sentence position (Aone et al., 1999). Three human annotators were employed to each provide reference orderings for the 180 summaries and mark paragraph (of at least 2 sentences) boundaries, which will be used by one of the evaluation metrics described below. In our implementation of the grouping-based ordering, sentences are represented as entity vectors and the threshold t = Avg( Sim( Sm, Sn))  c , the average sentence similarity in a group multiplied by a coefficient empirically decided on separate held-out datasets of 20 documents for each length category. The “group-representing sentence” is the textually earliest sentence in the group. We experimented with both CC and MKM to generate sentence groups and all the proposed algorithms in 2.3 for group-level and sentence- level orderings, resulting in 8 combinations as test orderings, each coded in the format of “Grouping (CC/MKM) / Group ordering (T/G) / Sentence ordering (T/G)”, where T and G represent the text order approach and the greedy selection approach respectively. For example, “CC/T/G” means grouping with CC, group ordering with text order, and sentence ordering with the greedy approach. We evaluated the test orderings against the 3 reference orderings and compute the average (Madnani et al., 2007) by using 3 different metrics. The first metric is Kendall’s τ (Lapata 2003, 2006), which has been reliably used in ordering evaluations (Bollegala et al., 2006; Madnani et al., 2007). It measures ordering differences in terms of the number of adjacent sentence inversions necessary to convert a test ordering to the reference ordering.   1 4m N( N 1) In this formula, m represents the number of inversions described above and N is the total number of sentences. The second metric is the Average Continuity (AC) proposed by Bollegala et al. (2006), which captures the intuition that the quality of sentence orderings can be estimated by the number of correctly arranged continuous sentences. 9 ACexp(1/(k1) klog(Pn)) n2 In this formula, k is the maximum number of continuous sentences, α is a small value in case Pn = 1. Pn, the proportion of continuous sentences of length n in an ordering, is defined as m/(N – n + 1) where m is the number of continuous sentences of length n in both the test and reference orderings and N is the total number of sentences. Following (Bollegala et al., 2006), we set k = Min(4, N) and α = 0.01. We also go a step further by considering only the continuous sentences in a paragraph marked by human annotators, because paragraphs are local meaning units perceived by human readers and the order of continuous sentences in a paragraph is more strongly grounded than the order of continuous sentences across paragraph boundaries. So in-paragraph sentence continuity is a better estimation for the quality of sentence orderings. This is our third metric: Paragraph-level Average Continuity (P-AC). P-ACexp(1/(k1) klog(PPn )) n2 Here PPn = m ’/(N – n + 1), where m ’ is the number of continuous sentences of length n in both the test ordering and a paragraph of the reference ordering. All the other parameters are as defined in AC and Pn. 3.2 Results The following tables show the results measured by each metric. For comparison, we also include a “Baseline” that uses the text order. For each dataset, two-tailed t-test is conducted between the top scorer and all the other orderings and statistical significance (p < 0.05) is marked with *. In general, our grouping-based ordering scheme outperforms the baseline for news articles of various lengths and statistically significant improvement can be observed on each dataset. This result casts serious doubt on the widely accepted practice of taking the text order for single-document summary generation, which is a major finding from our study. The three evaluation metrics give consistent results although they are based on different observations. The P-AC scores are much lower than their AC counterparts because of its strict paragraph constraint. Interestingly, applying the text order posterior to sentence grouping for group-level and sentence- level ordering leads to consistently optimal performance, as the top scorers on each dataset are almost all “__/T/T”. This suggests that the textual realization of coherence can be sought in the source document if possible, after the selected sentences are rearranged. It is in this sense that the general intuition about the text order is justified. It also suggests that tightly knit paragraphs (groups), where the sentences are closely connected, play a crucial role in creating a coherence flow. Shuffling those paragraphs may not affect the final coherence1. 1 Ithank an anonymous reviewer for pointing this out. 10 The grouping method does make a difference. While CC works best for the short and long datasets (D400 and D2k), MKM is more effective for the medium-sized dataset D1k. Whether the difference is simply due to length or linguistic/stylistic subtleties is an interesting topic for in-depth study. 4 Conclusion and Future Work We have established a grouping-based ordering scheme to accommodate both local and global coherence for summary generation. Experiments on single-document summaries validate our approach and challenge the well accepted text order by the summarization community. Nonetheless, the results do not necessarily propagate to multi-document summarization, for which the same-document clue for ordering cannot apply directly. Adapting the proposed scheme to multi-document summary generation is the ongoing work we are engaged in. In the next step, we will experiment with alternative sentence representations and ordering algorithms to achieve better performance. We are also considering adapting more sophisticated coherence-oriented models, such as (Soricut and Marcu, 2006; Elsner et al., 2007), to our problem so as to make more interesting comparisons possible.

<p>Author: Steffen Hedegaard ; Jakob Grue Simonsen</p><p>Abstract: We investigate authorship attribution using classifiers based on frame semantics. The purpose is to discover whether adding semantic information to lexical and syntactic methods for authorship attribution will improve them, specifically to address the difficult problem of authorship attribution of translated texts. Our results suggest (i) that frame-based classifiers are usable for author attribution of both translated and untranslated texts; (ii) that framebased classifiers generally perform worse than the baseline classifiers for untranslated texts, but (iii) perform as well as, or superior to the baseline classifiers on translated texts; (iv) that—contrary to current belief—naïve clas- sifiers based on lexical markers may perform tolerably on translated texts if the combination of author and translator is present in the training set of a classifier.</p><p>4 0.072575465 <a title="102-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Unsupervised_Semantic_Role_Induction_via_Split-Merge_Clustering.html">324 acl-2011-Unsupervised Semantic Role Induction via Split-Merge Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Joel Lang ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we describe an unsupervised method for semantic role induction which holds promise for relieving the data acquisition bottleneck associated with supervised role labelers. We present an algorithm that iteratively splits and merges clusters representing semantic roles, thereby leading from an initial clustering to a final clustering of better quality. The method is simple, surprisingly effective, and allows to integrate linguistic knowledge transparently. By combining role induction with a rule-based component for argument identification we obtain an unsupervised end-to-end semantic role labeling system. Evaluation on the CoNLL 2008 benchmark dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms competitive unsupervised approaches by a wide margin.</p><p>5 0.067812398 <a title="102-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Effective_Measures_of_Domain_Similarity_for_Parsing.html">109 acl-2011-Effective Measures of Domain Similarity for Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Barbara Plank ; Gertjan van Noord</p><p>Abstract: It is well known that parsing accuracy suffers when a model is applied to out-of-domain data. It is also known that the most beneficial data to parse a given domain is data that matches the domain (Sekine, 1997; Gildea, 2001). Hence, an important task is to select appropriate domains. However, most previous work on domain adaptation relied on the implicit assumption that domains are somehow given. As more and more data becomes available, automatic ways to select data that is beneficial for a new (unknown) target domain are becoming attractive. This paper evaluates various ways to automatically acquire related training data for a given test set. The results show that an unsupervised technique based on topic models is effective – it outperforms random data selection on both languages exam- ined, English and Dutch. Moreover, the technique works better than manually assigned labels gathered from meta-data that is available for English. 1 Introduction and Motivation Previous research on domain adaptation has focused on the task of adapting a system trained on one domain, say newspaper text, to a particular new domain, say biomedical data. Usually, some amount of (labeled or unlabeled) data from the new domain was given which has been determined by a human. However, with the growth of the web, more and more data is becoming available, where each document “is potentially its own domain” (McClosky et al., 2010). It is not straightforward to determine – 1566 Gertjan van Noord University of Groningen The Netherlands G J M van Noord@ rug nl . . . . . which data or model (in case we have several source domain models) will perform best on a new (unknown) target domain. Therefore, an important issue that arises is how to measure domain similarity, i.e. whether we can find a simple yet effective method to determine which model or data is most beneficial for an arbitrary piece of new text. Moreover, if we had such a measure, a related question is whether it can tell us something more about what is actually meant by “domain”. So far, it was mostly arbitrarily used to refer to some kind of coherent unit (related to topic, style or genre), e.g.: newspaper text, biomedical abstracts, questions, fiction. Most previous work on domain adaptation, for instance Hara et al. (2005), McClosky et al. (2006), Blitzer et al. (2006), Daum e´ III (2007), sidestepped this problem of automatic domain selection and adaptation. For parsing, to our knowledge only one recent study has started to examine this issue (McClosky et al., 2010) we will discuss their approach in Section 2. Rather, an implicit assumption of all of these studies is that domains are given, i.e. that they are represented by the respective corpora. Thus, a corpus has been considered a homogeneous unit. As more data is becoming available, it is unlikely that – domains will be ‘given’ . Moreover, a given corpus might not always be as homogeneous as originally thought (Webber, 2009; Lippincott et al., 2010). For instance, recent work has shown that the well-known Penn Treebank (PT) Wall Street Journal (WSJ) actually contains a variety of genres, including letters, wit and short verse (Webber, 2009). In this study we take a different approach. Rather than viewing a given corpus as a monolithic entity, ProceedingPso orftla thned 4,9 Otrhe Agonnn,u Jauln Mee 1e9t-i2ng4, o 2f0 t1h1e. A ?c s 2o0ci1a1ti Aonss foocria Ctioomnp fourta Ctioomnaplu Ltaintigouniaslti Lcisn,g puaigsetsic 1s566–1576, we break it down to the article-level and disregard corpora boundaries. Given the resulting set of documents (articles), we evaluate various ways to automatically acquire related training data for a given test set, to find answers to the following questions: • Given a pool of data (a collection of articles fGriovmen nun ak pnooowln o domains) caonldle a test article, eiss there a way to automatically select data that is relevant for the new domain? If so: • Which similarity measure is good for parsing? • How does it compare to human-annotated data? • Is the measure also useful for other languages Iasnd th/oer mtaesakssu?r To this end, we evaluate measures of domain similarity and feature representations and their impact on dependency parsing accuracy. Given a collection of annotated articles, and a new article that we want to parse, we want to select the most similar articles to train the best parser for that new article. In the following, we will first compare automatic measures to human-annotated labels by examining parsing performance within subdomains of the Penn Treebank WSJ. Then, we extend the experiments to the domain adaptation scenario. Experiments were performed on two languages: English and Dutch. The empirical results show that a simple measure based on topic distributions is effective for both languages and works well also for Part-of-Speech tagging. As the approach is based on plain surfacelevel information (words) and it finds related data in a completely unsupervised fashion, it can be easily applied to other tasks or languages for which annotated (or automatically annotated) data is available. 2 Related Work The work most related to ours is McClosky et al. (2010). They try to find the best combination of source models to parse data from a new domain, which is related to Plank and Sima’an (2008). In the latter, unlabeled data was used to create several parsers by weighting trees in the WSJ according to their similarity to the subdomain. McClosky et al. (2010) coined the term multiple source domain adaptation. Inspired by work on parsing accuracy 1567 prediction (Ravi et al., 2008), they train a linear regression model to predict the best (linear interpolation) of source domain models. Similar to us, McClosky et al. (2010) regard a target domain as mixture of source domains, but they focus on phrasestructure parsing. Furthermore, our approach differs from theirs in two respects: we do not treat source corpora as one entity and try to mix models, but rather consider articles as base units and try to find subsets of related articles (the most similar articles); moreover, instead of creating a supervised model (in their case to predict parsing accuracy), our approach is ‘simplistic’ : we apply measures of domain simi- larity directly (in an unsupervised fashion), without the necessity to train a supervised model. Two other related studies are (Lippincott et al., 2010; Van Asch and Daelemans, 2010). Van Asch and Daelemans (2010) explore a measure of domain difference (Renyi divergence) between pairs of domains and its correlation to Part-of-Speech tagging accuracy. Their empirical results show a linear correlation between the measure and the performance loss. Their goal is different, but related: rather than finding related data for a new domain, they want to estimate the loss in accuracy of a PoS tagger when applied to a new domain. We will briefly discuss results obtained with the Renyi divergence in Section 5.1. Lippincott et al. (2010) examine subdomain variation in biomedicine corpora and propose awareness of NLP tools to such variation. However, they did not yet evaluate the effect on a practical task, thus our study is somewhat complementary to theirs. The issue of data selection has recently been examined for Language Modeling (Moore and Lewis, 2010). A subset of the available data is automatically selected as training data for a Language Model based on a scoring mechanism that compares cross- entropy scores. Their approach considerably outperformed random selection and two previous proposed approaches both based on perplexity scoring.1 3 Measures of Domain Similarity 3.1 Measuring Similarity Automatically Feature Representations A similarity function may be defined over any set of events that are con1We tested data selection by perplexity scoring, but found the Language Models too small to be useful in our setting. sidered to be relevant for the task at hand. For parsing, these might be words, characters, n-grams (of words or characters), Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags, bilexical dependencies, syntactic rules, etc. However, to obtain more abstract types such as PoS tags or dependency relations, one would first need to gather respective labels. The necessary tools for this are again trained on particular corpora, and will suffer from domain shifts, rendering labels noisy. Therefore, we want to gauge the effect of the simplest representation possible: plain surface characteristics (unlabeled text). This has the advantage that we do not need to rely on additional supervised tools; moreover, it is interesting to know how far we can get with this level of information only. We examine the following feature representations: relative frequencies of words, relative frequencies of character tetragrams, and topic models. Our motivation was as follows. Relative frequencies of words are a simple and effective representation used e.g. in text classification (Manning and Sch u¨tze, 1999), while character n-grams have proven successful in genre classification (Wu et al., 2010). Topic models (Blei et al., 2003; Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007) can be considered an advanced model over word distributions: every article is represented by a topic distribution, which in turn is a distribution over words. Similarity between documents can be measured by comparing topic distributions. Similarity Functions There are many possible similarity (or distance) functions. They fall broadly into two categories: probabilistically-motivated and geometrically-motivated functions. The similarity functions examined in this study will be described in the following. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence D(q| |r) is a cTlahsesic Kaull measure oibfl ‘edri s(KtaLn)ce d’i2v ebregtweneceen D Dtw(oq probability distributions, and is defined as: D(q| |r) = Pyq(y)logrq((yy)). It is a non-negative, additive, aPsymmetric measure, and 0 iff the two distributions are identical. However, the KL-divergence is undefined if there exists an event y such that q(y) > 0 but r(y) = 0, which is a property that “makes it unsuitable for distributions derived via maximumlikelihood estimates” (Lee, 2001). 2It is not a proper distance metric since it is asymmetric. 1568 One option to overcome this limitation is to apply smoothing techniques to gather non-zero estimates for all y. The alternative, examined in this paper, is to consider an approximation to the KL divergence, such as the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence (Lin, 1991) and the skew divergence (Lee, 2001). The Jensen-Shannon divergence, which is symmetric, computes the KL-divergence between q, r, and the average between the two. We use the JS divergence as defined in Lee (2001): JS(q, r) = [D(q| |avg(q, r)) + D(r| |avg(q, r))] . The asymm[eDtr(icq |s|akvewg( divergence sα, proposed by Lee (2001), mixes one distribution with the other by a degree de- 21 fined by α ∈ [0, 1) : sα (q, r, α) = D(q| |αr + (1 α)q). Ays α α approaches 1, rt,hαe )sk =ew D divergence approximates the KL-divergence. An alternative way to measure similarity is to consider the distributions as vectors and apply geometrically-motivated distance functions. This family of similarity functions includes the cosine cos(q, r) = qq(y) · r(y)/ | |q(y) | | | |r(y) | |, euclidean − euc(q,r) = qPy(q(y) − r(y))2 and variational (also known asq LP1 or MPanhattan) distance function, defined as var(q, r) = Py |q(y) − r(y) |. 3.2 Human-annotatePd data In contrast to the automatic measures devised in the previous section, we might have access to human annotated data. That is, use label information such as topic or genre to define the set of similar articles. Genre For the Penn Treebank (PT) Wall Street Journal (WSJ) section, more specifically, the subset available in the Penn Discourse Treebank, there exists a partition of the data by genre (Webber, 2009). Every article is assigned one of the following genre labels: news, letters, highlights, essays, errata, wit and short verse, quarterly progress reports, notable and quotable. This classification has been made on the basis of meta-data (Webber, 2009). It is wellknown that there is no meta-data directly associated with the individual WSJ files in the Penn Treebank. However, meta-data can be obtained by looking at the articles in the ACL/DCI corpus (LDC99T42), and a mapping file that aligns document numbers of DCI (DOCNO) to WSJ keys (Webber, 2009). An example document is given in Figure 1. The metadata field HL contains headlines, SO source info, and the IN field includes topic markers.</p><p>6 0.065917291 <a title="102-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-ParaSense_or_How_to_Use_Parallel_Corpora_for_Word_Sense_Disambiguation.html">240 acl-2011-ParaSense or How to Use Parallel Corpora for Word Sense Disambiguation</a></p>

<p>Author: Anja Belz ; Eric Kow</p><p>Abstract: Studies assessing rating scales are very common in psychology and related fields, but are rare in NLP. In this paper we assess discrete and continuous scales used for measuring quality assessments of computergenerated language. We conducted six separate experiments designed to investigate the validity, reliability, stability, interchangeability and sensitivity of discrete vs. continuous scales. We show that continuous scales are viable for use in language evaluation, and offer distinct advantages over discrete scales. 1 Background and Introduction Rating scales have been used for measuring human perception of various stimuli for a long time, at least since the early 20th century (Freyd, 1923). First used in psychology and psychophysics, they are now also common in a variety of other disciplines, including NLP. Discrete scales are the only type of scale commonly used for qualitative assessments of computer-generated language in NLP (e.g. in the DUC/TAC evaluation competitions). Continuous scales are commonly used in psychology and related fields, but are virtually unknown in NLP. While studies assessing the quality of individual scales and comparing different types of rating scales are common in psychology and related fields, such studies hardly exist in NLP, and so at present little is known about whether discrete scales are a suitable rating tool for NLP evaluation tasks, or whether continuous scales might provide a better alternative. A range of studies from sociology, psychophysiology, biometrics and other fields have compared 230 Kow} @bright on .ac .uk discrete and continuous scales. Results tend to differ for different types of data. E.g., results from pain measurement show a continuous scale to outperform a discrete scale (ten Klooster et al., 2006). Other results (Svensson, 2000) from measuring students’ ease of following lectures show a discrete scale to outperform a continuous scale. When measuring dyspnea, Lansing et al. (2003) found a hybrid scale to perform on a par with a discrete scale. Another consideration is the types of data produced by discrete and continuous scales. Parametric methods of statistical analysis, which are far more sensitive than non-parametric ones, are commonly applied to both discrete and continuous data. However, parametric methods make very strong assumptions about data, including that it is numerical and normally distributed (Siegel, 1957). If these assumptions are violated, then the significance of results is overestimated. Clearly, the numerical assumption does not hold for the categorial data produced by discrete scales, and it is unlikely to be normally distributed. Many researchers are happier to apply parametric methods to data from continuous scales, and some simply take it as read that such data is normally distributed (Lansing et al., 2003). Our aim in the present study was to systematically assess and compare discrete and continuous scales when used for the qualitative assessment of computer-generated language. We start with an overview of assessment scale types (Section 2). We describe the experiments we conducted (Sec- tion 4), the data we used in them (Section 3), and the properties we examined in our inter-scale comparisons (Section 5), before presenting our results Proceedings ofP thoer t4l9atnhd A, Onrnuegaoln M,e Jeuntineg 19 o-f2 t4h,e 2 A0s1s1o.c?i ac t2io0n11 fo Ar Cssoocmiaptuiotanti foonra Clo Lminpguutiastti ocns:aslh Loirntpgaupisetricss, pages 230–235, Q1: Grammaticality The summary should have no datelines, system-internal formatting, capitalization errors or obviously ungrammatical sentences (e.g., fragments, missing components) that make the text difficult to read. 1.

(Section 6), and some conclusions (Section 7). 2 Rating Scales With Verbal Descriptor Scales (VDSs), participants give responses on ordered lists of verbally described and/or numerically labelled response cate- gories, typically varying in number from 2 to 11 (Svensson, 2000). An example of a VDS used in NLP is shown in Figure 1. VDSs are used very widely in contexts where computationally generated language is evaluated, including in dialogue, summarisation, MT and data-to-text generation. Visual analogue scales (VASs) are far less common outside psychology and related areas than VDSs. Responses are given by selecting a point on a typically horizontal line (although vertical lines have also been used (Scott and Huskisson, 2003)), on which the two end points represent the extreme values of the variable to be measured. Such lines can be mono-polar or bi-polar, and the end points are labelled with an image (smiling/frowning face), or a brief verbal descriptor, to indicate which end of the line corresponds to which extreme of the variable. The labels are commonly chosen to represent a point beyond any response actually likely to be chosen by raters. There is only one examples of a VAS in NLP system evaluation that we are aware of (Gatt et al., 2009). Hybrid scales, known as a graphic rating scales, combine the features of VDSs and VASs, and are also used in psychology. Here, the verbal descriptors are aligned along the line of a VAS and the endpoints are typically unmarked (Svensson, 2000). We are aware of one example in NLP (Williams and Reiter, 2008); 231 Q1: Grammaticality The summary should have no datelines, system-internal formatting, capitalization errors or obviously ungrammatical sentences (e.g., fragments, missing components) that make the text difficult to read. extbreamdely excellent Figure 2: Evaluation of Grammaticality with alternative VAS scale (cf. Figure 1). Evaluation task for each summary text: evaluator selects a place on the line to represent quality of the summary in terms of the criterion. we did not investigate this scale in our study. We used the following two specific scale designs in our experiments: VDS-7: 7 response categories, numbered (7 = best) and verbally described (e.g. 7 = “perfectly fluent” for Fluency, and 7 = “perfectly clear” for Clarity). Response categories were presented in a vertical list, with the best category at the bottom. Each category had a tick-box placed next to it; the rater’s task was to tick the box by their chosen rating. VAS: a horizontal, bi-polar line, with no ticks on it, mapping to 0–100. In the image description tests, statements identified the left end as negative, the right end as positive; in the weather forecast tests, the positive end had a smiling face and the label “statement couldn’t be clearer/read better”; the negative end had a frowning face and the label “statement couldn’t be more unclear/read worse”. The raters’ task was to move a pointer (initially in the middle of the line) to the place corresponding to their rating. 3 Data Weather forecast texts: In one half of our evaluation experiments we used human-written and automatically generated weather forecasts for the same weather data. The data in our evaluations was for 22 different forecast dates and included outputs from 10 generator systems and one set of human forecasts. This data has also been used for comparative system evaluation in previous research (Langner, 2010; Angeli et al., 2010; Belz and Kow, 2009). The following are examples of weather forecast texts from the data: 1: S SE 2 8 -3 2 INCREAS ING 3 6-4 0 BY MID AF TERNOON 2 : S ’ LY 2 6-3 2 BACKING S SE 3 0 -3 5 BY AFTERNOON INCREAS ING 3 5 -4 0 GUSTS 5 0 BY MID EVENING Image descriptions: In the other half of our evaluations, we used human-written and automatically generated image descriptions for the same images. The data in our evaluations was for 112 different image sets and included outputs from 6 generator systems and 2 sets of human-authored descriptions. This data was originally created in the TUNA Project (van Deemter et al., 2006). The following is an example of an item from the corpus, consisting of a set of images and a description for the entity in the red frame: the smal l blue fan 4 Experimental Set-up 4.1 Evaluation criteria Fluency/Readability: Both the weather forecast and image description evaluation experiments used a quality criterion intended to capture ‘how well a piece of text reads’ , called Fluency in the latter, Readability in the former. Adequacy/Clarity: In the image description experiments, the second quality criterion was Adequacy, explained as “how clear the description is”, and “how easy it would be to identify the image from the description”. This criterion was called Clarity in the weather forecast experiments, explained as “how easy is it to understand what is being described”. 4.2 Raters In the image experiments we used 8 raters (native speakers) in each experiment, from cohorts of 3rdyear undergraduate and postgraduate students doing a degree in a linguistics-related subject. They were paid and spent about 1hour doing the experiment. In the weather forecast experiments, we used 22 raters in each experiment, from among academic staff at our own university. They were not paid and spent about 15 minutes doing the experiment. 232 4.3 Summary overview of experiments Weather VDS-7 (A): VDS-7 scale; weather forecast data; criteria: Readability and Clarity; 22 raters (university staff) each assessing 22 forecasts. Weather VDS-7 (B): exact repeat of Weather VDS-7 (A), including same raters. Weather VAS: VAS scale; 22 raters (university staff), no overlap with raters in Weather VDS-7 experiments; other details same as in Weather VDS-7. Image VDS-7: VDS-7 scale; image description data; 8 raters (linguistics students) each rating 112 descriptions; criteria: Fluency and Adequacy. Image VAS (A): VAS scale; 8 raters (linguistics students), no overlap with raters in Image VAS-7; other details same as in Image VDS-7 experiment. Image VAS (B): exact repeat of Image VAS (A), including same raters. 4.4 Design features common to all experiments In all our experiments we used a Repeated Latin Squares design to ensure that each rater sees the same number of outputs from each system and for each text type (forecast date/image set). Following detailed instructions, raters first did a small number of practice examples, followed by the texts to be rated, in an order randomised for each rater. Evaluations were carried out via a web interface. They were allowed to interrupt the experiment, and in the case of the 1hour long image description evaluation they were encouraged to take breaks. 5 Comparison and Assessment of Scales Validity is to the extent to which an assessment method measures what it is intended to measure (Svensson, 2000). Validity is often impossible to assess objectively, as is the case of all our criteria except Adequacy, the validity of which we can directly test by looking at correlations with the accuracy with which participants in a separate experiment identify the intended images given their descriptions. A standard method for assessing Reliability is Kendall’s W, a coefficient of concordance, measuring the degree to which different raters agree in their ratings. We report W for all 6 experiments. Stability refers to the extent to which the results of an experiment run on one occasion agree with the results of the same experiment (with the same raters) run on a different occasion. In the present study, we assess stability in an intra-rater, test-retest design, assessing the agreement between the same participant’s responses in the first and second runs of the test with Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient. We report these measures between ratings given in Image VAS (A) vs. those given in Image VAS (B), and between ratings given in Weather VDS-7 (A) vs. those given in Weather VDS-7 (B). We assess Interchangeability, that is, the extent to which our VDS and VAS scales agree, by computing Pearson’s and Spearman’s coefficients between results. We report these measures for all pairs of weather forecast/image description evaluations. We assess the Sensitivity of our scales by determining the number of significant differences between different systems and human authors detected by each scale. We also look at the relative effect of the different experimental factors by computing the F-Ratio for System (the main factor under investigation, so its relative effect should be high), Rater and Text Type (their effect should be low). F-ratios were de- termined by a one-way ANOVA with the evaluation criterion in question as the dependent variable and System, Rater or Text Type as grouping factors. 6 Results 6.1 Interchangeability and Reliability for system/human authored image descriptions Interchangeability: Pearson’s r between the means per system/human in the three image description evaluation experiments were as follows (Spearman’s ρ shown in brackets): Forb.eqAdFlouthV AD S d-(e7Aq)uac.y945a78n*d(V.F9A2l5uS8e*(—An *c)y,.98o36r.748*e1l9a*(tV.i98(Ao.2578nS019s(*5B b) e- tween Image VDS-7 and Image VAS (A) (the main VAS experiment) are extremely high, meaning that they could substitute for each other here.

Between ratings given by the same raters first in Weather VDS-7 (A) and then in Weather VDS-7 (B), Pearson’s r was .656 for Clarity, .704 for Readability. (All significant at p < .01.) Note that these are computed on individual scores (rather than means as in the correlation figures given in previous sections). 6.4 F-ratios and post-hoc analysis for image data The table below shows F-ratios determined by a oneway ANOVA with the evaluation criterion in question (Adequacy/Fluency) as the dependent variable and System/Rater/Text Type as the grouping factor. Note that for System a high F-ratio is desirable, but a low F-ratio is desirable for other factors. tem, the main factor under investigation, VDS-7 found 8 for Adequacy and 14 for Fluency; VAS (A) found 7 for Adequacy and 15 for Fluency. 6.5 F-ratios and post-hoc analysis for weather data The table below shows F-ratios analogous to the previous section (for Clarity/Readability). tem, VDS-7 (A) found 24 for Clarity, 23 for Readability; VAS found 25 for Adequacy, 26 for Fluency. 6.6 Scale validity test for image data Our final table of results shows Pearson’s correlation coefficients (calculated on means per system) between the Adequacy data from the three image description evaluation experiments on the one hand, and the data from an extrinsic experiment in which we measured the accuracy with which participants identified the intended image described by a description: ThecorIlm at iog ne V bAeDSt w-(A7eB)An dA eqd uqe ac uy a cy.I89nD720d 6AI*Dc .Acuray was strong and highly significant in all three image description evaluation experiments, but strongest in VAS (B), and weakest in VAS (A). For comparison, 234 Pearson’s between Fluency and ID Accuracy ranged between .3 and .5, whereas Pearson’s between Adequacy and ID Speed (also measured in the same image identfication experiment) ranged between -.35 and -.29. 7 Discussion and Conclusions Our interchangeability results (Sections 6. 1and 6.2) indicate that the VAS and VDS-7 scales we have tested can substitute for each other in our present evaluation tasks in terms of the mean system scores they produce. Where we were able to measure validity (Section 6.6), both scales were shown to be similarly valid, predicting image identification accuracy figures from a separate experiment equally well. Stability (Section 6.3) was marginally better for VDS-7 data, and Reliability (Sections 6.1 and 6.2) was better for VAS data in the image descrip- tion evaluations, but (mostly) better for VDS-7 data in the weather forecast evaluations. Finally, the VAS experiments found greater numbers of statistically significant differences between systems in 3 out of 4 cases (Section 6.5). Our own raters strongly prefer working with VAS scales over VDSs. This has also long been clear from the psychology literature (Svensson, 2000)), where raters are typically found to prefer VAS scales over VDSs which can be a “constant source of vexation to the conscientious rater when he finds his judgments falling between the defined points” (Champney, 1941). Moreover, if a rater’s judgment falls between two points on a VDS then they must make the false choice between the two points just above and just below their actual judgment. In this case we know that the point they end up selecting is not an accurate measure of their judgment but rather just one of two equally accurate ones (one of which goes unrecorded). Our results establish (for our evaluation tasks) that VAS scales, so far unproven for use in NLP, are at least as good as VDSs, currently virtually the only scale in use in NLP. Combined with the fact that raters strongly prefer VASs and that they are regarded as more amenable to parametric means of statistical analysis, this indicates that VAS scales should be used more widely for NLP evaluation tasks.

Using aggregate demographic statistics about the authors’ geographic communities, we solve a multi-output regression problem between demographics and lexical frequencies. By imposing a composite ‘1,∞ regularizer, we obtain structured sparsity, driving entire rows of coefficients to zero. We perform two regression studies. First, we use term frequencies to predict demographic attributes; our method identifies a compact set of words that are strongly associated with author demographics. Next, we conjoin demographic attributes into features, which we use to predict term frequencies. The composite regularizer identifies a small number of features, which correspond to communities of authors united by shared demographic and linguistic properties.</p><p>6 0.58147317 <a title="102-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-A_New_Dataset_and_Method_for_Automatically_Grading_ESOL_Texts.html">20 acl-2011-A New Dataset and Method for Automatically Grading ESOL Texts</a></p>

<p>Author: Xianchao Wu ; Takuya Matsuzaki ; Jun'ichi Tsujii</p><p>Abstract: In the present paper, we propose the effective usage of function words to generate generalized translation rules for forest-based translation. Given aligned forest-string pairs, we extract composed tree-to-string translation rules that account for multiple interpretations of both aligned and unaligned target function words. In order to constrain the exhaustive attachments of function words, we limit to bind them to the nearby syntactic chunks yielded by a target dependency parser. Therefore, the proposed approach can not only capture source-tree-to-target-chunk correspondences but can also use forest structures that compactly encode an exponential number of parse trees to properly generate target function words during decoding. Extensive experiments involving large-scale English-toJapanese translation revealed a significant im- provement of 1.8 points in BLEU score, as compared with a strong forest-to-string baseline system.</p><p>5 0.53579772 <a title="102-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Social_Network_Extraction_from_Texts%3A_A_Thesis_Proposal.html">286 acl-2011-Social Network Extraction from Texts: A Thesis Proposal</a></p>

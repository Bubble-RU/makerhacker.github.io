The system has been implemented for operation on an iPad. The topic graph is constructed from N web snippets which are determined by a standard search engine.

<p>Author: Ryo Nagata ; Edward Whittaker ; Vera Sheinman</p><p>Abstract: The availability of learner corpora, especially those which have been manually error-tagged or shallow-parsed, is still limited. This means that researchers do not have a common development and test set for natural language processing of learner English such as for grammatical error detection. Given this background, we created a novel learner corpus that was manually error-tagged and shallowparsed. This corpus is available for research and educational purposes on the web. In this paper, we describe it in detail together with its data-collection method and annotation schemes. Another contribution of this paper is that we take the first step toward evaluating the performance of existing POStagging/chunking techniques on learner corpora using the created corpus. These contributions will facilitate further research in related areas such as grammatical error detection and automated essay scoring.</p><p>5 0.10974415 <a title="284-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Parsing_the_Internal_Structure_of_Words%3A_A_New_Paradigm_for_Chinese_Word_Segmentation.html">241 acl-2011-Parsing the Internal Structure of Words: A New Paradigm for Chinese Word Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongguo Li</p><p>Abstract: Lots of Chinese characters are very productive in that they can form many structured words either as prefixes or as suffixes. Previous research in Chinese word segmentation mainly focused on identifying only the word boundaries without considering the rich internal structures of many words. In this paper we argue that this is unsatisfying in many ways, both practically and theoretically. Instead, we propose that word structures should be recovered in morphological analysis. An elegant approach for doing this is given and the result is shown to be promising enough for encouraging further effort in this direction. Our probability model is trained with the Penn Chinese Treebank and actually is able to parse both word and phrase structures in a unified way. 1 Why Parse Word Structures? Research in Chinese word segmentation has progressed tremendously in recent years, with state of the art performing at around 97% in precision and recall (Xue, 2003; Gao et al., 2005; Zhang and Clark, 2007; Li and Sun, 2009). However, virtually all these systems focus exclusively on recognizing the word boundaries, giving no consideration to the internal structures of many words. Though it has been the standard practice for many years, we argue that this paradigm is inadequate both in theory and in practice, for at least the following four reasons. The first reason is that if we confine our definition of word segmentation to the identification of word boundaries, then people tend to have divergent 1405 opinions as to whether a linguistic unit is a word or not (Sproat et al., 1996). This has led to many different annotation standards for Chinese word segmentation. Even worse, this could cause inconsistency in the same corpus. For instance, 䉂 擌 奒 ‘vice president’ is considered to be one word in the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005), but is split into two words by the Peking University corpus in the SIGHAN Bakeoffs (Sproat and Emerson, 2003). Meanwhile, 䉂 䀓 惼 ‘vice director’ and 䉂 䚲䡮 ‘deputy are both segmented into two words in the same Penn Chinese Treebank. In fact, all these words are composed of the prefix 䉂 ‘vice’ and a root word. Thus the structure of 䉂擌奒 ‘vice president’ can be represented with the tree in Figure 1. Without a doubt, there is complete agree- manager’ NN ,,ll JJf NNf 䉂 擌奒 Figure 1: Example of a word with internal structure. ment on the correctness of this structure among native Chinese speakers. So if instead of annotating only word boundaries, we annotate the structures of every word, then the annotation tends to be more 1 1Here it is necessary to add a note on terminology used in this paper. Since there is no universally accepted definition of the “word” concept in linguistics and especially in Chinese, whenever we use the term “word” we might mean a linguistic unit such as 䉂 擌奒 ‘vice president’ whose structure is shown as the tree in Figure 1, or we might mean a smaller unit such as 擌奒 ‘president’ which is a substructure of that tree. Hopefully, ProceedingPso orftla thned 4,9 Otrhe Agonnn,u Jauln Mee 1e9t-i2ng4, o 2f0 t1h1e. A ?c s 2o0ci1a1ti Aonss foocria Ctioomnp fourta Ctioomnaplu Ltaintigouniaslti Lcisn,g puaigsetsic 1s405–1414, consistent and there could be less duplication of efforts in developing the expensive annotated corpus. The second reason is applications have different requirements for granularity of words. Take the personal name 撱 嗤吼 ‘Zhou Shuren’ as an example. It’s considered to be one word in the Penn Chinese Treebank, but is segmented into a surname and a given name in the Peking University corpus. For some applications such as information extraction, the former segmentation is adequate, while for others like machine translation, the later finer-grained output is more preferable. If the analyzer can produce a structure as shown in Figure 4(a), then every application can extract what it needs from this tree. A solution with tree output like this is more elegant than approaches which try to meet the needs of different applications in post-processing (Gao et al., 2004). The third reason is that traditional word segmentation has problems in handling many phenomena in Chinese. For example, the telescopic compound 㦌 撥 怂惆 ‘universities, middle schools and primary schools’ is in fact composed ofthree coordinating elements 㦌惆 ‘university’, 撥 惆 ‘middle school’ and 怂惆 ‘primary school’ . Regarding it as one flat word loses this important information. Another example is separable words like 扩 扙 ‘swim’ . With a linear segmentation, the meaning of ‘swimming’ as in 扩 堑 扙 ‘after swimming’ cannot be properly represented, since 扩扙 ‘swim’ will be segmented into discontinuous units. These language usages lie at the boundary between syntax and morphology, and are not uncommon in Chinese. They can be adequately represented with trees (Figure 2).

The last reason why we should care about word the context will always make it clear what is being referred to with the term “word”. 1406 structures is related to head driven statistical parsers (Collins, 2003). To illustrate this, note that in the Penn Chinese Treebank, the word 戽 䊂䠽 吼 ‘English People’ does not occur at all. Hence constituents headed by such words could cause some difficulty for head driven models in which out-ofvocabulary words need to be treated specially both when they are generated and when they are conditioned upon. But this word is in turn headed by its suffix 吼 ‘people’, and there are 2,233 such words in Penn Chinese Treebank. If we annotate the structure of every compound containing this suffix (e.g. Figure 3), such data sparsity simply goes away.</p><p>6 0.10887818 <a title="284-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Beam-Width_Prediction_for_Efficient_Context-Free_Parsing.html">58 acl-2011-Beam-Width Prediction for Efficient Context-Free Parsing</a></p>

We develop a novel hidden Markov model incorporating sophisticated smoothing using a hierarchical Pitman-Yor processes prior, providing an elegant and principled means of incorporating lexical characteristics. Central to our approach is a new type-based sampling algorithm for hierarchical Pitman-Yor models in which we track fractional table counts. In an empirical evaluation we show that our model consistently out-performs the current state-of-the-art across 10 languages.</p><p>6 0.51314408 <a title="284-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Neutralizing_Linguistically_Problematic_Annotations_in_Unsupervised_Dependency_Parsing_Evaluation.html">230 acl-2011-Neutralizing Linguistically Problematic Annotations in Unsupervised Dependency Parsing Evaluation</a></p>

<p>Author: Kosho Shudo ; Akira Kurahone ; Toshifumi Tanabe</p><p>Abstract: It has been widely recognized that one of the most difficult and intriguing problems in natural language processing (NLP) is how to cope with idiosyncratic multiword expressions. This paper presents an overview of the comprehensive dictionary (JDMWE) of Japanese multiword expressions. The JDMWE is characterized by a large notational, syntactic, and semantic diversity of contained expressions as well as a detailed description of their syntactic functions, structures, and flexibilities. The dictionary contains about 104,000 expressions, potentially 750,000 expressions. This paper shows that the JDMWE’s validity can be supported by comparing the dictionary with a large-scale Japanese N-gram frequency dataset, namely the LDC2009T08, generated by Google Inc. (Kudo et al. 2009). 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.78569138 <a title="284-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Simple_Unsupervised_Grammar_Induction_from_Raw_Text_with_Cascaded_Finite_State_Models.html">284 acl-2011-Simple Unsupervised Grammar Induction from Raw Text with Cascaded Finite State Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Elias Ponvert ; Jason Baldridge ; Katrin Erk</p><p>Abstract: We consider a new subproblem of unsupervised parsing from raw text, unsupervised partial parsing—the unsupervised version of text chunking. We show that addressing this task directly, using probabilistic finite-state methods, produces better results than relying on the local predictions of a current best unsupervised parser, Seginer’s (2007) CCL. These finite-state models are combined in a cascade to produce more general (full-sentence) constituent structures; doing so outperforms CCL by a wide margin in unlabeled PARSEVAL scores for English, German and Chinese. Finally, we address the use of phrasal punctuation as a heuristic indicator of phrasal boundaries, both in our system and in CCL.</p><p>3 0.73906434 <a title="284-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-An_Affect-Enriched_Dialogue_Act_Classification_Model_for_Task-Oriented_Dialogue.html">33 acl-2011-An Affect-Enriched Dialogue Act Classification Model for Task-Oriented Dialogue</a></p>
<p>Author: Kristy Boyer ; Joseph Grafsgaard ; Eun Young Ha ; Robert Phillips ; James Lester</p><p>Abstract: Dialogue act classification is a central challenge for dialogue systems. Although the importance of emotion in human dialogue is widely recognized, most dialogue act classification models make limited or no use of affective channels in dialogue act classification. This paper presents a novel affect-enriched dialogue act classifier for task-oriented dialogue that models facial expressions of users, in particular, facial expressions related to confusion. The findings indicate that the affectenriched classifiers perform significantly better for distinguishing user requests for feedback and grounding dialogue acts within textual dialogue. The results point to ways in which dialogue systems can effectively leverage affective channels to improve dialogue act classification. 1</p><p>4 0.70888656 <a title="284-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Probabilistic_Document_Modeling_for_Syntax_Removal_in_Text_Summarization.html">251 acl-2011-Probabilistic Document Modeling for Syntax Removal in Text Summarization</a></p>
<p>Author: William M. Darling ; Fei Song</p><p>Abstract: Statistical approaches to automatic text summarization based on term frequency continue to perform on par with more complex summarization methods. To compute useful frequency statistics, however, the semantically important words must be separated from the low-content function words. The standard approach of using an a priori stopword list tends to result in both undercoverage, where syntactical words are seen as semantically relevant, and overcoverage, where words related to content are ignored. We present a generative probabilistic modeling approach to building content distributions for use with statistical multi-document summarization where the syntax words are learned directly from the data with a Hidden Markov Model and are thereby deemphasized in the term frequency statistics. This approach is compared to both a stopword-list and POS-tagging approach and our method demonstrates improved coverage on the DUC 2006 and TAC 2010 datasets using the ROUGE metric.</p><p>5 0.70680058 <a title="284-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Data_point_selection_for_cross-language_adaptation_of_dependency_parsers.html">92 acl-2011-Data point selection for cross-language adaptation of dependency parsers</a></p>
<p>Author: Anders Sgaard</p><p>Abstract: We consider a very simple, yet effective, approach to cross language adaptation of dependency parsers. We first remove lexical items from the treebanks and map part-of-speech tags into a common tagset. We then train a language model on tag sequences in otherwise unlabeled target data and rank labeled source data by perplexity per word of tag sequences from less similar to most similar to the target. We then train our target language parser on the most similar data points in the source labeled data. The strategy achieves much better results than a non-adapted baseline and stateof-the-art unsupervised dependency parsing, and results are comparable to more complex projection-based cross language adaptation algorithms.</p><p>6 0.67934495 <a title="284-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Automatically_Predicting_Peer-Review_Helpfulness.html">55 acl-2011-Automatically Predicting Peer-Review Helpfulness</a></p>

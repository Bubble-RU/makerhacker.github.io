<p>Author: Ines Rehbein ; Josef Ruppenhofer</p><p>Abstract: Active Learning (AL) has been proposed as a technique to reduce the amount of annotated data needed in the context of supervised classification. While various simulation studies for a number of NLP tasks have shown that AL works well on goldstandard data, there is some doubt whether the approach can be successful when applied to noisy, real-world data sets. This paper presents a thorough evaluation of the impact of annotation noise on AL and shows that systematic noise resulting from biased coder decisions can seriously harm the AL process. We present a method to filter out inconsistent annotations during AL and show that this makes AL far more robust when ap- plied to noisy data.</p><p>3 0.21897142 <a title="145-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Rare_Word_Translation_Extraction_from_Aligned_Comparable_Documents.html">259 acl-2011-Rare Word Translation Extraction from Aligned Comparable Documents</a></p>
<p>Author: Emmanuel Prochasson ; Pascale Fung</p><p>Abstract: We present a first known result of high precision rare word bilingual extraction from comparable corpora, using aligned comparable documents and supervised classification. We incorporate two features, a context-vector similarity and a co-occurrence model between words in aligned documents in a machine learning approach. We test our hypothesis on different pairs of languages and corpora. We obtain very high F-Measure between 80% and 98% for recognizing and extracting correct translations for rare terms (from 1to 5 occurrences). Moreover, we show that our system can be trained on a pair of languages and test on a different pair of languages, obtaining a F-Measure of 77% for the classification of Chinese-English translations using a training corpus of Spanish-French. Our method is therefore even potentially applicable to low resources languages without training data.</p><p>4 0.17867644 <a title="145-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-On-line_Language_Model_Biasing_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">233 acl-2011-On-line Language Model Biasing for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Sankaranarayanan Ananthakrishnan ; Rohit Prasad ; Prem Natarajan</p><p>Abstract: The language model (LM) is a critical component in most statistical machine translation (SMT) systems, serving to establish a probability distribution over the hypothesis space. Most SMT systems use a static LM, independent of the source language input. While previous work has shown that adapting LMs based on the input improves SMT performance, none of the techniques has thus far been shown to be feasible for on-line systems. In this paper, we develop a novel measure of cross-lingual similarity for biasing the LM based on the test input. We also illustrate an efficient on-line implementation that supports integration with on-line SMT systems by transferring much of the computational load off-line. Our approach yields significant reductions in target perplexity compared to the static LM, as well as consistent improvements in SMT performance across language pairs (English-Dari and English-Pashto).</p><p>5 0.17142548 <a title="145-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Latent_Semantic_Word_Sense_Induction_and_Disambiguation.html">198 acl-2011-Latent Semantic Word Sense Induction and Disambiguation</a></p>
<p>Author: Tim Van de Cruys ; Marianna Apidianaki</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified model for the automatic induction of word senses from text, and the subsequent disambiguation of particular word instances using the automatically extracted sense inventory. The induction step and the disambiguation step are based on the same principle: words and contexts are mapped to a limited number of topical dimensions in a latent semantic word space. The intuition is that a particular sense is associated with a particular topic, so that different senses can be discriminated through their association with particular topical dimensions; in a similar vein, a particular instance of a word can be disambiguated by determining its most important topical dimensions. The model is evaluated on the SEMEVAL-20 10 word sense induction and disambiguation task, on which it reaches stateof-the-art results.</p><p>6 0.12396803 <a title="145-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Identification_of_Domain-Specific_Senses_in_a_Machine-Readable_Dictionary.html">158 acl-2011-Identification of Domain-Specific Senses in a Machine-Readable Dictionary</a></p>

<p>Author: Christian Rohrdantz ; Annette Hautli ; Thomas Mayer ; Miriam Butt ; Daniel A. Keim ; Frans Plank</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to detecting and tracking changes in word meaning by visually modeling and representing diachronic development in word contexts. Previous studies have shown that computational models are capable of clustering and disambiguating senses, a more recent trend investigates whether changes in word meaning can be tracked by automatic methods. The aim of our study is to offer a new instrument for investigating the diachronic development of word senses in a way that allows for a better understanding of the nature of semantic change in general. For this purpose we combine techniques from the field of Visual Analytics with unsupervised methods from Natural Language Processing, allowing for an interactive visual exploration of semantic change.</p><p>4 0.69733065 <a title="145-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Identification_of_Domain-Specific_Senses_in_a_Machine-Readable_Dictionary.html">158 acl-2011-Identification of Domain-Specific Senses in a Machine-Readable Dictionary</a></p>
<p>Author: Fumiyo Fukumoto ; Yoshimi Suzuki</p><p>Abstract: This paper focuses on domain-specific senses and presents a method for assigning category/domain label to each sense of words in a dictionary. The method first identifies each sense of a word in the dictionary to its corresponding category. We used a text classification technique to select appropriate senses for each domain. Then, senses were scored by computing the rank scores. We used Markov Random Walk (MRW) model. The method was tested on English and Japanese resources, WordNet 3.0 and EDR Japanese dictionary. For evaluation of the method, we compared English results with the Subject Field Codes (SFC) resources. We also compared each English and Japanese results to the first sense heuristics in the WSD task. These results suggest that identification of domain-specific senses (IDSS) may actually be of benefit.</p><p>5 0.69118732 <a title="145-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Latent_Semantic_Word_Sense_Induction_and_Disambiguation.html">198 acl-2011-Latent Semantic Word Sense Induction and Disambiguation</a></p>

Simplification rules are learned from a comparable corpus, and the rules are applied in a context-aware fashion to input sentences. Our method is unsupervised. Furthermore, it does not require any alignment or correspondence among the complex and simple corpora. We evaluate the simplification according to three criteria: preservation of grammaticality, preservation of meaning, and degree of simplification. Results show that our method outperforms an established simplification baseline for both meaning preservation and simplification, while maintaining a high level of grammaticality.</p><p>3 0.94758523 <a title="145-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Combining_Indicators_of_Allophony.html">74 acl-2011-Combining Indicators of Allophony</a></p>
<p>Author: Luc Boruta</p><p>Abstract: Allophonic rules are responsible for the great variety in phoneme realizations. Infants can not reliably infer abstract word representations without knowledge of their native allophonic grammar. We explore the hypothesis that some properties of infants’ input, referred to as indicators, are correlated with allophony. First, we provide an extensive evaluation of individual indicators that rely on distributional or lexical information. Then, we present a first evaluation of the combination of indicators of different types, considering both logical and numerical combinations schemes. Though distributional and lexical indicators are not redundant, straightforward combinations do not outperform individual indicators.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.91827607 <a title="145-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Good_Seed_Makes_a_Good_Crop%3A_Accelerating_Active_Learning_Using_Language_Modeling.html">145 acl-2011-Good Seed Makes a Good Crop: Accelerating Active Learning Using Language Modeling</a></p>

<p>Author: Chi-kiu Lo ; Dekai Wu</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel semi-automated metric, MEANT, that assesses translation utility by matching semantic role fillers, producing scores that correlate with human judgment as well as HTER but at much lower labor cost. As machine translation systems improve in lexical choice and fluency, the shortcomings of widespread n-gram based, fluency-oriented MT evaluation metrics such as BLEU, which fail to properly evaluate adequacy, become more apparent. But more accurate, nonautomatic adequacy-oriented MT evaluation metrics like HTER are highly labor-intensive, which bottlenecks the evaluation cycle. We first show that when using untrained monolingual readers to annotate semantic roles in MT output, the non-automatic version of the metric HMEANT achieves a 0.43 correlation coefficient with human adequacyjudgments at the sentence level, far superior to BLEU at only 0.20, and equal to the far more expensive HTER. We then replace the human semantic role annotators with automatic shallow semantic parsing to further automate the evaluation metric, and show that even the semiautomated evaluation metric achieves a 0.34 correlation coefficient with human adequacy judgment, which is still about 80% as closely correlated as HTER despite an even lower labor cost for the evaluation procedure. The results show that our proposed metric is significantly better correlated with human judgment on adequacy than current widespread automatic evaluation metrics, while being much more cost effective than HTER. 1</p><p>6 0.86683351 <a title="145-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Learning_to_Grade_Short_Answer_Questions_using_Semantic_Similarity_Measures_and_Dependency_Graph_Alignments.html">205 acl-2011-Learning to Grade Short Answer Questions using Semantic Similarity Measures and Dependency Graph Alignments</a></p>

<p>Author: Nadir Durrani ; Helmut Schmid ; Alexander Fraser</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel machine translation model which models translation by a linear sequence of operations. In contrast to the “N-gram” model, this sequence includes not only translation but also reordering operations. Key ideas of our model are (i) a new reordering approach which better restricts the position to which a word or phrase can be moved, and is able to handle short and long distance reorderings in a unified way, and (ii) a joint sequence model for the translation and reordering probabilities which is more flexible than standard phrase-based MT. We observe statistically significant improvements in BLEU over Moses for German-to-English and Spanish-to-English tasks, and comparable results for a French-to-English task.</p><p>4 0.25053009 <a title="263-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Learning_Hierarchical_Translation_Structure_with_Linguistic_Annotations.html">202 acl-2011-Learning Hierarchical Translation Structure with Linguistic Annotations</a></p>
<p>Author: Markos Mylonakis ; Khalil Sima'an</p><p>Abstract: While it is generally accepted that many translation phenomena are correlated with linguistic structures, employing linguistic syntax for translation has proven a highly non-trivial task. The key assumption behind many approaches is that translation is guided by the source and/or target language parse, employing rules extracted from the parse tree or performing tree transformations. These approaches enforce strict constraints and might overlook important translation phenomena that cross linguistic constituents. We propose a novel flexible modelling approach to introduce linguistic information of varying granularity from the source side. Our method induces joint probability synchronous grammars and estimates their parameters, by select- ing and weighing together linguistically motivated rules according to an objective function directly targeting generalisation over future data. We obtain statistically significant improvements across 4 different language pairs with English as source, mounting up to +1.92 BLEU for Chinese as target.</p><p>5 0.22942102 <a title="263-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Learning_to_Transform_and_Select_Elementary_Trees_for_Improved_Syntax-based_Machine_Translations.html">206 acl-2011-Learning to Transform and Select Elementary Trees for Improved Syntax-based Machine Translations</a></p>
<p>Author: Bing Zhao ; Young-Suk Lee ; Xiaoqiang Luo ; Liu Li</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel technique of learning how to transform the source parse trees to improve the translation qualities of syntax-based translation models using synchronous context-free grammars. We transform the source tree phrasal structure into a set of simpler structures, expose such decisions to the decoding process, and find the least expensive transformation operation to better model word reordering. In particular, we integrate synchronous binarizations, verb regrouping, removal of redundant parse nodes, and incorporate a few important features such as translation boundaries. We learn the structural preferences from the data in a generative framework. The syntax-based translation system integrating the proposed techniques outperforms the best Arabic-English unconstrained system in NIST08 evaluations by 1.3 absolute BLEU, which is statistically significant.</p><p>6 0.21978877 <a title="263-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Reordering_Metrics_for_MT.html">264 acl-2011-Reordering Metrics for MT</a></p>

<p>Author: Alexandra Birch ; Miles Osborne</p><p>Abstract: One of the major challenges facing statistical machine translation is how to model differences in word order between languages. Although a great deal of research has focussed on this problem, progress is hampered by the lack of reliable metrics. Most current metrics are based on matching lexical items in the translation and the reference, and their ability to measure the quality of word order has not been demonstrated. This paper presents a novel metric, the LRscore, which explicitly measures the quality of word order by using permutation distance metrics. We show that the metric is more consistent with human judgements than other metrics, including the BLEU score. We also show that the LRscore can successfully be used as the objective function when training translation model parameters. Training with the LRscore leads to output which is preferred by humans. Moreover, the translations incur no penalty in terms of BLEU scores.</p><p>6 0.60657591 <a title="263-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Learning_Hierarchical_Translation_Structure_with_Linguistic_Annotations.html">202 acl-2011-Learning Hierarchical Translation Structure with Linguistic Annotations</a></p>

<p>Author: Andreas Zollmann ; Stephan Vogel</p><p>Abstract: In this work we propose methods to label probabilistic synchronous context-free grammar (PSCFG) rules using only word tags, generated by either part-of-speech analysis or unsupervised word class induction. The proposals range from simple tag-combination schemes to a phrase clustering model that can incorporate an arbitrary number of features. Our models improve translation quality over the single generic label approach of Chiang (2005) and perform on par with the syntactically motivated approach from Zollmann and Venugopal (2006) on the NIST large Chineseto-English translation task. These results persist when using automatically learned word tags, suggesting broad applicability of our technique across diverse language pairs for which syntactic resources are not available.</p><p>4 0.66347551 <a title="263-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Transition-based_Dependency_Parsing_with_Rich_Non-local_Features.html">309 acl-2011-Transition-based Dependency Parsing with Rich Non-local Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Yue Zhang ; Joakim Nivre</p><p>Abstract: Transition-based dependency parsers generally use heuristic decoding algorithms but can accommodate arbitrarily rich feature representations. In this paper, we show that we can improve the accuracy of such parsers by considering even richer feature sets than those employed in previous systems. In the standard Penn Treebank setup, our novel features improve attachment score form 91.4% to 92.9%, giving the best results so far for transitionbased parsing and rivaling the best results overall. For the Chinese Treebank, they give a signficant improvement of the state of the art.

<p>Author: Xianchao Wu ; Takuya Matsuzaki ; Jun'ichi Tsujii</p><p>Abstract: In the present paper, we propose the effective usage of function words to generate generalized translation rules for forest-based translation. Given aligned forest-string pairs, we extract composed tree-to-string translation rules that account for multiple interpretations of both aligned and unaligned target function words. In order to constrain the exhaustive attachments of function words, we limit to bind them to the nearby syntactic chunks yielded by a target dependency parser. Therefore, the proposed approach can not only capture source-tree-to-target-chunk correspondences but can also use forest structures that compactly encode an exponential number of parse trees to properly generate target function words during decoding. Extensive experiments involving large-scale English-toJapanese translation revealed a significant im- provement of 1.8 points in BLEU score, as compared with a strong forest-to-string baseline system.</p><p>6 0.65843654 <a title="263-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Exploiting_Web-Derived_Selectional_Preference_to_Improve_Statistical_Dependency_Parsing.html">127 acl-2011-Exploiting Web-Derived Selectional Preference to Improve Statistical Dependency Parsing</a></p>

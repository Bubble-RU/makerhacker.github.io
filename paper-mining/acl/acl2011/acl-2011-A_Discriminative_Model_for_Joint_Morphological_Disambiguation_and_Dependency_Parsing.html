</p><p>3 In this paper, we propose a discriminative model that jointly infers morphological properties and syntactic structures. [sent-6, score-0.675]
</p><p>4 In evaluations on various highly-inflected languages, this joint model  outperforms both a baseline tagger in morphological disambiguation, and a pipeline parser in head selection. [sent-7, score-0.957]
</p><p>5 1 Introduction To date, studies of morphological analysis and dependency parsing have been pursued more or less independently. [sent-8, score-0.724]
</p><p>6 Morphological taggers disambiguate morphological attributes such as partof-speech (POS) or case, without taking syntax into account (Hakkani-T u¨r et al. [sent-9, score-0.676]
</p><p>7 , 2001); dependency parsers commonly assume the “pipeline” approach, relying on morphological information as part of the input (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al. [sent-11, score-0.637]
</p><p>8 This approach serves many languages well, especially those with less morphological ambiguity. [sent-13, score-0.566]
</p><p>9 , 2003), and that of dependency parsing has reached the low nineties (Nivre et al. [sent-18, score-0.182]
</p><p>10 For these languages, there may be little to be gained to justify the computational cost of incorporating syntactic inference during the morphological tagging task; conversely, it is doubtful that errorful morphological information is a main cause of errors in English dependency parsing. [sent-20, score-1.223]
</p><p>11 However, the pipeline approach seems more problematic for morphologically-rich languages with substantial interactions between morphology and syntax (Tsarfaty, 2006). [sent-21, score-0.265]
</p><p>12 Consider the Latin sentence, Una dies omnis potuit praecurrere amantis, ‘One day was able to make up for all the lovers’ 1. [sent-22, score-0.531]
</p><p>13 As shown in Table 1, the adjective omnis (‘all’) is ambiguous in number, gender, and case; there are seven valid analyses. [sent-23, score-0.331]
</p><p>14 From the perspective of a finitestate morphological tagger, the most attractive analysis is arguably the singular nominative, since omnis is immediately followed by the singular verb potuit (‘could’). [sent-24, score-0.917]
</p><p>15 Given its nominative case, the pipeline parser assigned the verb potuit to  be its head; the two words form the typical subjectverb relation, agreeing in number. [sent-26, score-0.345]
</p><p>16 Unfortunately, as shown in Figure 1, the word omnis in fact modifies the noun amantis, at the end of the sentence. [sent-27, score-0.327]
</p><p>17 The pipeline parser, acting on the input that omnis is nominative, naturally did not see 1Taken from poem 1. [sent-31, score-0.423]
</p><p>18 The word omnis has 7 possible combinations of number, gender and case, while amantis has 5. [sent-37, score-0.559]
</p><p>19 Disambiguation partly depends on establishing amantis as the head of omnis, and so the two must agree in all three attributes. [sent-38, score-0.216]
</p><p>20 In this paper we propose to attack this chickenand-egg problem with a discriminative model that jointly infers morphological and syntactic properties of a sentence, given its words as input. [sent-42, score-0.675]
</p><p>21 In evaluations on various highly-inflected languages, the model outperforms both a baseline tagger in morphological disambiguation, and a pipeline parser in head selection. [sent-43, score-0.863]

</p><p>23 2  Previous Work  Since space does not allow a full review of the vast literature on morphological analysis and parsing, we focus only on past research involving joint morphological and syntactic inference (§2. [sent-46, score-1.164]
</p><p>24 The word omnis is an adjective modifying the noun amantis. [sent-52, score-0.407]
</p><p>25 This information is key to the morphological disambiguation of both  words, as shown in Table 1. [sent-53, score-0.605]
</p><p>26 Each of the resulting morphemes is then tagged with an atomic “part-of-speech” to indicate word class and some morphological features. [sent-59, score-0.548]
</p><p>27 Similarly, the English POS tags in the Penn Treebank combine word class information with morphological attributes such as “plural” or “past tense”. [sent-60, score-0.649]
</p><p>28 This paper is the first to use a fully discriminative model for joint morphological and syntactic inference on dependency trees. [sent-64, score-0.802]
</p><p>29 However, it does have a relatively free word order, and is also highly inflected, with each word having up to nine morphological attributes, listed in Table 2. [sent-67, score-0.514]
</p><p>30 For instance, the suffix −is in omnis cannot be segmented into morphemes t−haist separately ninndoicta btee gender, number, aonrpdh case. [sent-69, score-0.331]
</p><p>31 According to the Latin morphological database encoded in MORPHEUS (Crane, 1991), 30% of Latin nouns can be parsed as another part-of-speech, and on average each has 3. [sent-70, score-0.565]
</p><p>32 We know of only one previous attempt in datadriven dependency parsing for Latin (Bamman and Crane, 2008), with the goal of constructing a dynamic lexicon for a digital library. [sent-72, score-0.231]
</p><p>33 Parsing is per-  formed using the usual pipeline approach, first with the TreeTagger analyzer (Schmid, 1994) and then with a state-of-the-art dependency parser (McDonald et al. [sent-73, score-0.303]
</p><p>34 Of the nine morphological attributes, gender and especially case had the lowest accuracy. [sent-78, score-0.606]
</p><p>35 3  Joint Model  This section describes a model that jointly infers morphological and syntactic properties of a sentence. [sent-81, score-0.675]
</p><p>36 Let n be the number of words and m be the number of possible values for a morphological attribute. [sent-87, score-0.514]
</p><p>37 ,wn  of the input sen-  TAG: O(nm) boolean variables3 Ta,i,v, corresponding to each value of the morphological attributes listed in Table 2. [sent-92, score-0.682]
</p><p>38 Ta,i,v = true when the word wi has value v as its morphological attribute a. [sent-93, score-0.659]
</p><p>39 LINK: O(n2) boolean variables Li,j corresponding to a possible link between each pair  3The TAG variables were actually implemented as multinomials, but are presented here as booleans for ease of understanding. [sent-96, score-0.426]
</p><p>40 y F ciorcr clarity, this graph shows only those variables and factors associated with one pair of words (i. [sent-100, score-0.338]
</p><p>41 , w3=omnis and w6=amantis) and with one morphological attribute (i. [sent-102, score-0.559]
</p><p>42 The variables L3,6, CASE3,acc and CASE6,acc are bolded, indicating that w3 and w6 are linked and both have the accusative case. [sent-105, score-0.193]
</p><p>43 Li,j = true when there is a dependency link from the word wi to the word wj. [sent-108, score-0.352]
</p><p>44 In Figure 2, the variable L3,6 is set to true since there is a dependency link between the words w3 and w6. [sent-109, score-0.29]
</p><p>45 The factors Fk (A) represent soft constraints evaluating various aspects orefp trhees “goodness” of the tree structure implied by A. [sent-112, score-0.206]
</p><p>46 1 Local Factors The local factors consult either one word or two neighboring words, and their morphological attributes. [sent-118, score-0.769]
</p><p>47 These factors express the desirability of the assignments ofmorphological attributes based on local context. [sent-119, score-0.442]
</p><p>48 The features consist of the value v of the morphological attribute concerned, combined with the word identity of wi, with backoff using all suffixes of the word. [sent-122, score-0.559]
</p><p>49 The CASEUNIGRAM factors shown in Figure 2 are examples of this family of factors. [sent-123, score-0.206]
</p><p>50 TAG-BIGRAM: There are O(nm2) of such binary factors, each connected to the TAG variables of a pair ofneighboring words. [sent-124, score-0.187]
</p><p>51 The CASE-BIGRAM factors shown in Figure 2 are examples of this family of factors. [sent-126, score-0.206]
</p><p>52 TAG-CONSISTENCY: For each word, the TAG vTariables representing the possible POS values are connected to those representing the values of other morphological attributes, yielding O(nm2) binary factors. [sent-127, score-0.569]
</p><p>53 These factors are intended to discourage inconsistent assignments, such as a non-null tense for a noun. [sent-129, score-0.249]
</p><p>54 It is clear that so far, none of these factors are aware of the morphological agreement between omnis and amantis, crucial for inferring their syntactic relation. [sent-130, score-1.059]
</p><p>55 2  Link Factors  The link factors consult all pairs of words, possibly separated by a long distance, that may have a dependency link. [sent-133, score-0.507]
</p><p>56 These factors model the likelihood of such a link based on the word identities and their morphological attributes: •  •  WORD-LINK: There are O(n2) such unary factors, each connected to a LINK variable, as shown in Figure 2. [sent-134, score-0.964]
</p><p>57 POS-LINK: There are O(n2m2) such ternary  factors, each connected to the variables Li,j, Ti,pos,vi and Tj,pos,vj . [sent-138, score-0.239]
</p><p>58 It fires when all three are true or, in other words, when the parent word wi has POS vi, and the child wj has POS vj . [sent-139, score-0.353]
</p><p>59 These factors are not shown in Figure 2, but would have exactly the same structure as the CASE-LINK factors. [sent-142, score-0.206]
</p><p>60 If fully implemented in our joint model, these features would necessitate two separate families of link factors: O(n3m3) factors for the POS trigrams, and O(n2m4) factors for the  POS 4-grams. [sent-148, score-0.663]
</p><p>61 To avoid this substantial increase in model complexity, these features are instead approximated: the POS of all words involved in the trigrams and 4-grams, except those of wi and wj, are regarded as fixed, their values being taken from the output of a morphological tagger (§4. [sent-149, score-0.736]
</p><p>62 •  4  MORPH-LINK: There are O(n2m2) such ternary factors, each connected to the variables Li,j, Ti,a,vi and Tj,a,vj , for every attribute a other than POS. [sent-153, score-0.284]
</p><p>63 The factor fires when all three variables are true, and both vi and vj are nonnull; i. [sent-154, score-0.334]
</p><p>64 , it fires when the parent word wi has vi as its morphological attribute a, and the child wj has vj. [sent-156, score-0.873]
</p><p>65 The CASE-LINK factors in Figure 2 are an example of this family of factors. [sent-158, score-0.206]
</p><p>66 Roughly speaking, they divide up the variables and factors of the joint model and train them separately. [sent-160, score-0.461]
</p><p>67 For morphological disambiguation, we use the baseline tagger described in §4. [sent-161, score-0.608]
</p><p>68 1 Baseline Morphological Tagger The tagger is a graphical model with the WORD and TAG variables, connected by the local factors TAG-UNIGRAM, TAG-BIGRAM, and TAGCONSISTENCY, all used in the joint model (§3). [sent-167, score-0.543]
</p><p>69 2  Baseline Dependency Parser  The parser has no local factors, but has the same variables as the joint model and the same features from all three families of link factors (§3). [sent-169, score-0.672]
</p><p>70 However, sfironmce ailtl tthakreees as input othf eli morphological Hatotrwibeuvteers, predicted by the tagger, the TAG variables are now  observed. [sent-170, score-0.646]
</p><p>71 This leads to a change in the structure of the link factors all features from the POSLINK factors now belong to the WORD-LINK factors, since the POS of all words are observed. [sent-171, score-0.541]
</p><p>72 , 2005), but also extended beyond POS to the other morphological attributes, with the features in the MORPH-LINK factors incorporated into WORD-LINK for similar reasons. [sent-173, score-0.72]
</p><p>73 We produced head attachments by first calculating the posteriors of the LINK variables with BP and then passing them to an edgefactored tree decoder. [sent-192, score-0.178]
</p><p>74 This MBR decoding procedure enforces the hard constraint that the output be a tree but sums over possible morphological assignments. [sent-194, score-0.544]
</p><p>75 4 Reducing Model Complexity In principle, the joint model should consider every possible combination ofmorphological attributes for every word. [sent-196, score-0.322]
</p><p>76 for the number of variables and factors described in §3. [sent-203, score-0.338]
</p><p>77 The MORPHEUS database was automatically generated from a list of stems, inflections, irregular forms and morphological rules. [sent-206, score-0.565]
</p><p>78 Similarly, we constructed morphological dictionaries for Czech, Ancient Greek, and Hungarian from words that occurred at least five times in the training data; words that occurred fewer times were unrestricted in the morphological attributes they could take on. [sent-210, score-1.163]
</p><p>79 6  Experimental Results  We compare the performance of the pipeline model (§4) and the joint model (§3) on morphological disambiguation jaonidnt tu mnloadbeelle (d§3 dependency parsing. [sent-211, score-1.006]
</p><p>80 The agglutinative morphological system makes local cues more effective, but syntactic information helps in almost all categories. [sent-218, score-0.587]
</p><p>81 1 Morphological Disambiguation As seen in Table 3, the joint model outperforms6 the baseline tagger in all attributes in Latin morphological disambiguation. [sent-220, score-0.866]
</p><p>82 Among words not covered by the morphological database, accuracy in POS is slightly better, but lower for case, gender and number. [sent-221, score-0.606]
</p><p>83 Experiments on the other three languages bear out similar results: the joint model improves morphological disambiguation. [sent-227, score-0.689]
</p><p>84 The performance of Czech (Table 4) exhibits the closest analogue to Latin: gender, number, and case are much less accurately predicted than are the other morphological attributes. [sent-228, score-0.514]
</p><p>85 The Ancient Greek treebank comprises both archaic texts, before the development of a definite article, and later classic Greek, which has a definite article; Hungarian has both a definite and an indefinite article. [sent-230, score-0.256]
</p><p>86 The  verbal system of ancient Greek, in contrast, is more complex than that of the other languages, so mood, voice, and tense accuracy are lower. [sent-232, score-0.213]
</p><p>87 2 Dependency Parsing In addition to morphological disambiguation, we also measured the performance of the joint model on dependency parsing of Latin and the other languages. [sent-234, score-0.819]
</p><p>88 Wrong decisions made by the baseline tagger often misled the pipeline parser. [sent-248, score-0.22]
</p><p>89 For adjectives, the example shown in Table 1and Figure 1is a typical scenario, where an accusative adjective was tagged as nominative, and was then misanalyzed by the parser  as modifying a verb (as a subject) rather than modifying an accusative noun. [sent-249, score-0.302]
</p><p>90 For participles modifying a noun, the wrong noun was often chosen based on inaccurate morphological information. [sent-250, score-0.624]
</p><p>91 In these cases, the joint model, entertaining all morphological possibilities, was able to find the combination of links and morphological analyses that are collectively more likely. [sent-251, score-1.122]
</p><p>92 The differences may partially be attributed to the different morphological tagger used, and the different learning algorithm, namely Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) in (McDonald et al. [sent-253, score-0.608]
</p><p>93 Gold Pipeline Parser When given perfect morphological information, the Latin parser performs at 65. [sent-256, score-0.568]
</p><p>94 This is hardly surprising, given the relatively small training set, and that the “the most difficult languages are those that combine a relatively free word order with a high degree of inflection”, as observed at the recent dependency parsing shared task (Nivre et al. [sent-259, score-0.234]
</p><p>95 A particularly troublesome structure is coordination; the most frequent link errors all involve either a parent or a child as a conjunction. [sent-261, score-0.197]
</p><p>96 Since the factors in our model consult only one link at a time, they do not sufficiently capture this kind of structures. [sent-263, score-0.413]
</p><p>97 Higher-order features, particularly those concerned with links with grandparents and siblings, have been shown to benefit dependency parsing (Smith and Eisner, 2008) and may be able to address this issue. [sent-264, score-0.182]
</p><p>98 7  Conclusions and Future Work  We have proposed a discriminative model that jointly infers morphological properties and syntactic structures. [sent-265, score-0.675]
</p><p>99 In evaluations on various highly-inflected languages, this joint model outperforms both a base-  line tagger in morphological disambiguation, and a pipeline parser in head selection. [sent-266, score-0.957]
</p><p>100 Further evaluation on other morphological systems would also be desirable. [sent-269, score-0.514]

<p>Author: Ann Clifton ; Anoop Sarkar</p><p>Abstract: This paper extends the training and tuning regime for phrase-based statistical machine translation to obtain fluent translations into morphologically complex languages (we build an English to Finnish translation system) . Our methods use unsupervised morphology induction. Unlike previous work we focus on morphologically productive phrase pairs – our decoder can combine morphemes across phrase boundaries. Morphemes in the target language may not have a corresponding morpheme or word in the source language. Therefore, we propose a novel combination of post-processing morphology prediction with morpheme-based translation. We show, using both automatic evaluation scores and linguistically motivated analyses of the output, that our methods outperform previously proposed ones and pro- vide the best known results on the EnglishFinnish Europarl translation task. Our methods are mostly language independent, so they should improve translation into other target languages with complex morphology. 1 Translation and Morphology Languages with rich morphological systems present significant hurdles for statistical machine translation (SMT) , most notably data sparsity, source-target asymmetry, and problems with automatic evaluation. In this work, we propose to address the problem of morphological complexity in an Englishto-Finnish MT task within a phrase-based translation framework. We focus on unsupervised segmentation methods to derive the morphological information supplied to the MT model in order to provide coverage on very large datasets and for languages with few hand-annotated 32 resources. In fact, in our experiments, unsupervised morphology always outperforms the use of a hand-built morphological analyzer. Rather than focusing on a few linguistically motivated aspects of Finnish morphological behaviour, we develop techniques for handling morphological complexity in general. We chose Finnish as our target language for this work, because it exemplifies many of the problems morphologically complex languages present for SMT. Among all the languages in the Europarl data-set, Finnish is the most difficult language to translate from and into, as was demonstrated in the MT Summit shared task (Koehn, 2005) . Another reason is the current lack of knowledge about how to apply SMT successfully to agglutinative languages like Turkish or Finnish. Our main contributions are: 1) the introduction of the notion of segmented translation where we explicitly allow phrase pairs that can end with a dangling morpheme, which can connect with other morphemes as part of the translation process, and 2) the use of a fully segmented translation model in combination with a post-processing morpheme prediction system, using unsupervised morphology induction. Both of these approaches beat the state of the art on the English-Finnish translation task. Morphology can express both content and function categories, and our experiments show that it is important to use morphology both within the translation model (for morphology with content) and outside it (for morphology contributing to fluency) . Automatic evaluation measures for MT, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), WER (Word Error Rate) and PER (Position Independent Word Error Rate) use the word as the basic unit rather than morphemes.

In addition to standard MT evaluation measures, we perform a detailed linguistic analysis of the output. Our proposed approaches are significantly better than the state of the art, achieving the highest reported BLEU scores on the English-Finnish Europarl version 3 data-set. Our linguistic analysis shows that our models have fewer morpho-syntactic errors compared to the word-based baseline. 2 2.1 Models Baseline Models We set up three baseline models for comparison in this work. The first is a basic wordbased model (called Baseline in the results) ; we trained this on the original unsegmented version of the text. Our second baseline is a factored translation model (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) (called Factored) , which used as factors the word, “stem” 1 and suffix. These are derived from the same unsupervised segmentation model used in other experiments. The results (Table 3) show that a factored model was unable to match the scores of a simple wordbased baseline. We hypothesize that this may be an inherently difficult representational form for a language with the degree of morphological complexity found in Finnish. Because the morphology generation must be precomputed, for languages with a high degree of morphological complexity, the combinatorial explosion makes it unmanageable to capture the full range of morphological productivity. In addition, because the morphological variants are generated on a per-word basis within a given phrase, it excludes productive morphological combination across phrase boundaries and makes it impossible for the model to take into account any longdistance dependencies between morphemes. We conclude from this result that it may be more useful for an agglutinative language to use morphology beyond the confines of the phrasal unit, and condition its generation on more than just the local target stem. In order to compare the 1see Section 2.2. 33 performance of unsupervised segmentation for translation, our third baseline is a segmented translation model based on a supervised segmentation model (called Sup) , using the hand-built Omorfi morphological analyzer (Pirinen and Listenmaa, 2007) , which provided slightly higher BLEU scores than the word-based baseline. 2.2 Segmented Translation For segmented translation models, it cannot be taken for granted that greater linguistic accuracy in segmentation yields improved translation (Chang et al. , 2008) . Rather, the goal in segmentation for translation is instead to maximize the amount of lexical content-carrying morphology, while generalizing over the information not helpful for improving the translation model. We therefore trained several different segmentation models, considering factors of granularity, coverage, and source-target symmetry. We performed unsupervised segmentation of the target data, using Morfessor (Creutz and Lagus, 2005) and Paramor (Monson, 2008) , two top systems from the Morpho Challenge 2008 (their combined output was the Morpho Challenge winner) . However, translation models based upon either Paramor alone or the combined systems output could not match the wordbased baseline, so we concentrated on Morfessor. Morfessor uses minimum description length criteria to train a HMM-based segmentation model. When tested against a human-annotated gold standard of linguistic morpheme segmentations for Finnish, this algorithm outperforms competing unsupervised methods, achieving an F-score of 67.0% on a 3 million sentence corpus (Creutz and Lagus, 2006) . Varying the perplexity threshold in Morfessor does not segment more word types, but rather over-segments the same word types. In order to get robust, common segmentations, we trained the segmenter on the 5000 most frequent words2 ; we then used this to segment the entire data set. In order to improve coverage, we then further segmented 2For the factored model baseline we also used the same setting perplexity = 30, 5,000 most frequent words, but with all but the last suffix collapsed and called the “stem” . TabHMleoat1nr:gplhiMngor phermphocTur631ae04in, 81c9ie03ns67gi,64n0S14e567theTp 2rsa51t, 29Se 3t168able and in translation. any word type that contained a match from the most frequent suffix set, looking for the longest matching suffix character string. We call this method Unsup L-match. After the segmentation, word-internal morpheme boundary markers were inserted into the segmented text to be used to reconstruct the surface forms in the MT output. We then trained the Moses phrase-based system (Koehn et al., 2007) on the segmented and marked text. After decoding, it was a simple matter to join together all adjacent morphemes with word-internal boundary markers to reconstruct the surface forms. Figure 1(a) gives the full model overview for all the variants of the segmented translation model (supervised/unsupervised; with and without the Unsup L-match procedure) . Table 1shows how morphemes are being used in the MT system. Of the phrases that included segmentations (‘Morph’ in Table 1) , roughly a third were ‘productive’, i.e. had a hanging morpheme (with a form such as stem+) that could be joined to a suffix (‘Hanging Morph’ in Table 1) . However, in phrases used while decoding the development and test data, roughly a quarter of the phrases that generated the translated output included segmentations, but of these, only a small fraction (6%) had a hanging morpheme; and while there are many possible reasons to account for this we were unable to find a single convincing cause. 2.3 Morphology Generation Morphology generation as a post-processing step allows major vocabulary reduction in the translation model, and allows the use of morphologically targeted features for modeling inflection. A possible disadvantage of this approach is that in this model there is no opportunity to con34 sider the morphology in translation since it is removed prior to training the translation model. Morphology generation models can use a variety of bilingual and contextual information to capture dependencies between morphemes, often more long-distance than what is possible using n-gram language models over morphemes in the segmented model. Similar to previous work (Minkov et al. , 2007; Toutanova et al. , 2008) , we model morphology generation as a sequence learning problem. Un- like previous work, we use unsupervised morphology induction and use automatically generated suffix classes as tags. The first phase of our morphology prediction model is to train a MT system that produces morphologically simplified word forms in the target language. The output word forms are complex stems (a stem and some suffixes) but still missing some important suffix morphemes. In the second phase, the output of the MT decoder is then tagged with a sequence of abstract suffix tags. In particular, the output of the MT decoder is a sequence of complex stems denoted by x and the output is a sequence of suffix class tags denoted by y. We use a list of parts from (x,y) and map to a d-dimensional feature vector Φ(x, y) , with each dimension being a real number. We infer the best sequence of tags using: F(x) = argymaxp(y | x,w) where F(x) returns the highest scoring output y∗ . A conditional random field (CRF) (Lafferty et al. , 2001) defines the conditional probability as a linear score for each candidate y and a global normalization term: logp(y | x, w) = Φ(x, y) · w − log Z where Z = Py0∈ exp(Φ(x, y0) · w) . We use stochastiPc gradient descent (using crfsgd3) to train the weight vector w. So far, this is all off-the-shelf sequence learning. However, the output y∗ from the CRF decoder is still only a sequence of abstract suffix tags. The third and final phase in our morphology prediction model GEN(x) 3 http://leon. bottou. org/projects/sgd English Training Data words Finnish Training Data words Morphological Pre-Processing stem+ +morph MT System Alignment: word word word stem+ +morph stem stem+ +morph Post-Process: Morph Re-Stitching Fully inflected surface form Evaluation against original reference (a) Segmented Translation Model English Training Data words Finnish Training Data Morphological Pre-Prowceosrdsisng 1 stem+ +morph1+ +morph2 Morphological Pre-Processing 2 stem+ +morph1+ MPosrpthe-mPRr+eo-+cSmetsio crhp1i:nhg+swteomrd+ MA+lTmigwnSomyrspdthen 1mt:+ wsotermd complex stem: stem+morph1+ MPo rpsht-oPlro gcyesGse2n:erCaRtioFnstem+morph1+ morph2sLuarnfagcueagfeorMmomdealp ing Fully inflected surface form Evaluation against original reference (b) Post-Processing Model Translation & Generation Figure 1: Training and testing pipelines for the SMT models. is to take the abstract suffix tag sequence y∗ and then map it into fully inflected word forms, and rank those outputs using a morphemic language model. The abstract suffix tags are extracted from the unsupervised morpheme learning process, and are carefully designed to enable CRF training and decoding. We call this model CRFLM for short. Figure 1(b) shows the full pipeline and Figure 2 shows a worked example of all the steps involved. We use the morphologically segmented training data (obtained using the segmented corpus described in Section 2.24) and remove selected suffixes to create a morphologically simplified version of the training data. The MT model is trained on the morphologically simplified training data. The output from the MT system is then used as input to the CRF model. The CRF model was trained on a ∼210,000 Finnish sentences, consisting noefd d∼ o1n.5 a am ∼il2li1o0n,0 tokens; tishhe 2,000 cseens,te cnoncse Europarl t.e5s tm isl eito nco tnoskiesntesd; hoef 41,434 stem tokens. The labels in the output sequence y were obtained by selecting the most productive 150 stems, and then collapsing certain vowels into equivalence classes corresponding to Finnish vowel harmony patterns. Thus 4Note that unlike Section 2.2 we do not use Unsup L-match because when evaluating the CRF model on the suffix prediction task it obtained 95.61% without using Unsup L-match and 82.99% when using Unsup L-match. 35 variants -k¨ o and -ko become vowel-generic enclitic particle -kO, and variants -ss ¨a and -ssa become the vowel-generic inessive case marker -ssA, etc. This is the only language-specific component of our translation model. However, we expect this approach to work for other agglutinative languages as well. For fusional languages like Spanish, another mapping from suffix to abstract tags might be needed. These suffix transformations to their equivalence classes prevent morphophonemic variants of the same morpheme from competing against each other in the prediction model. This resulted in 44 possible label outputs per stem which was a reasonable sized tag-set for CRF training. The CRF was trained on monolingual features of the segmented text for suffix prediction, where t is the current token: Word Stem st−n, .., st, .., st+n(n = 4) Morph Prediction yt−2 , yt−1 , yt With this simple feature set, we were able to use features over longer distances, resulting in a total of 1,110,075 model features. After CRF based recovery of the suffix tag sequence, we use a bigram language model trained on a full segmented version on the training data to recover the original vowels. We used bigrams only, because the suffix vowel harmony alternation depends only upon the preceding phonemes in the word from which it was segmented. original training koskevaa mietint o¨ ¨a data: k ¨asitell ¨a ¨an segmentation: koske+ +va+ +a mietint ¨o+ + a¨ k a¨si+ +te+ +ll a¨+ + a¨+ +n (train bigram language model with mapping A = { a , a }) map n fi bniaglr asmuff liaxn gtou agbest mraocdte tag-set: koske+ +va+ +A mietint ¨o+ +A k ¨asi+ +te+ +ll ¨a+ + ¨a+ +n (train CRF model to predict the final suffix) peeling of final suffix: koske+ +va+ mietint ¨o+ k a¨si+ +te+ +ll a¨+ + a¨+ (train SMT model on this transformation of training data) (a) Training decoder output: koske+ +va+ mietint o¨+ k a¨si+ +te+ +ll a¨+ + a¨+ decoder output stitched up: koskeva+ mietint o¨+ k ¨asitell ¨a ¨a+ CRF model prediction: x = ‘koskeva+ mietint ¨o+ k ¨asitell ¨a ¨a+’, y = ‘+A +A +n’ koskeva+ +A mietint ¨o+ +A k ¨asitell a¨ ¨a+ +n unstitch morphemes: koske+ +va+ +A mietint ¨o+ +A k ¨asi+ +te+ +ll ¨a+ + ¨a+ +n language model disambiguation: koske+ +va+ +a mietint ¨o+ + a¨ k a¨si+ +te+ +ll a¨+ + a¨+ +n final stitching: koskevaa mietint o¨ ¨a k ¨asitell ¨a ¨an (the output is then compared to the reference translation) (b) Decoding Figure 2: Worked example of all steps in the post-processing morphology prediction model. 3 Experimental Results used the Europarl version 3 corpus (Koehn, 2005) English-Finnish training data set, as well as the standard development and test data sets.

In all the experiments conducted in this paper, we used the Moses5 phrase-based translation system (Koehn et al. , 2007) , 2008 version. We trained all of the Moses systems herein using the standard features: language model, reordering model, translation model, and word penalty; in addition to these, the factored experiments called for additional translation and generation features for the added factors as noted above. We used in all experiments the following settings: a hypothesis stack size 100, distortion limit 6, phrase translations limit 20, and maximum phrase length 20. For the language models, we used SRILM 5-gram language models (Stolcke, 2002) for all factors. For our word-based Baseline system, we trained a word-based model using the same Moses system with identical settings. For evaluation against segmented translation systems in segmented forms before word reconstruction, we also segmented the baseline system’s word-based output. All the BLEU scores reported are for lowercase evaluation. We did an initial evaluation of the segmented output translation for each system using the no5http://www.statmt.org/moses/ 36 TabSlBUeuna2gps:meulSipengLmta-e nioatedchMo12dme804-.lB8S714cL±oEr0eUs.6 9 S8up19Nre.358ofe498rUs9ntoihe supervised segmentation baseline model. m-BLEU indicates that the segmented output was evaluated against a segmented version of the reference (this measure does not have the same correlation with human judgement as BLEU) .

Table 2 shows the m-BLEU scores for various systems. We also show the m-BLEU score without unigrams, since over-segmentation could lead to artificially high m-BLEU scores. In fact, if we compare the relative improvement of our m-BLEU scores for the Unsup L-match system we see a relative improvement of 39.75% over the baseline. Luong et. al. (2010) report an m-BLEU score of 55.64% but obtain a relative improvement of 0.6% over their baseline m-BLEU score. We find that when using a good segmentation model, segmentation of the morphologically complex target language improves model performance over an unsegmented baseline (the confidence scores come from bootstrap resampling) .

We also show a better relative improvement over our baseline when compared to (Luong et al., 2010) : a relative improvement of 4.86% for Unsup L-match compared to our baseline word-based model, compared to their 1.65% improvement over their baseline word-based model.

While we wish to explore minimally supervised morphological MT models, and use as little language specific information as possible, we do want to use linguistic analysis on the output of our system to see how well the models capture essential morphological information in the target language. So, we ran the word-based baseline system, the segmented model (Unsup L-match) , and the prediction model (CRF-LM) outputs, along with the reference translation through the supervised morphological analyzer Omorfi (Pirinen and Listenmaa, 2007) . Using this analysis, we looked at a variety of linguistic constructions that might reveal patterns in morphological behavior. These were: (a) explicitly marked 37 noun forms, (b) noun-adjective case agreement, (c) subject-verb person/number agreement, (d) transitive object case marking, (e) postpositions, and (f) possession. In each of these categories, we looked for construction matches on a per-sentence level between the models’ output and the reference translation. Table 4 shows the models’ performance on the constructions we examined. In all of the categories, the CRF-LM model achieves the best precision score, as we explain below, while the Unsup L-match model most frequently gets the highest recall score. A general pattern in the most prevalent of these constructions is that the baseline tends to prefer the least marked form for noun cases (corresponding to the nominative) more than the reference or the CRF-LM model. The baseline leaves nouns in the (unmarked) nominative far more than the reference, while the CRF-LM model comes much closer, so it seems to fare better at explicitly marking forms, rather than defaulting to the more frequent unmarked form. Finnish adjectives must be marked with the same case as their head noun, while verbs must agree in person and number with their subject. We saw that in both these categories, the CRFLM model outperforms for precision, while the segmented model gets the best recall. In addition, Finnish generally marks direct objects of verbs with the accusative or the partitive case; we observed more accusative/partitive-marked nouns following verbs in the CRF-LM output than in the baseline, as illustrated by example (1) in Fig. 3. While neither translation picks the same verb as in the reference for the input ‘clarify,’ the CRFLM-output paraphrases it by using a grammatical construction of the transitive verb followed by a noun phrase inflected with the accusative case, correctly capturing the transitive construction. The baseline translation instead follows ‘give’ with a direct object in the nominative case. To help clarify the constructions in question, we have used Google Translate6 to provide back6 http://translate.google. com/ of occurrences per sentence, recall and F-score. also averaged The constructions over the various translations. are listed in descending P, R and F stand for precision, order of their frequency in the texts. The highlighted value in each column is the most accurate with respect to the reference value. translations of our MT output into English; to contextualize these back-translations, we have provided Google’s back-translation of the reference. The use of postpositions shows another difference between the models. Finnish postpositions require the preceding noun to be in the genitive or sometimes partitive case, which occurs correctly more frequently in the CRF-LM than the baseline. In example (2) in Fig. 3, all three translations correspond to the English text, ‘with the basque nationalists. ’ However, the CRF-LM output is more grammatical than the baseline, because not only do the adjective and noun agree for case, but the noun ‘baskien’ to which the postposition ‘kanssa’ belongs is marked with the correct genitive case. However, this well-formedness is not rewarded by BLEU, because ‘baskien’ does not match the reference. In addition, while Finnish may express possession using case marking alone, it has another construction for possession; this can disambiguate an otherwise ambiguous clause. This alternate construction uses a pronoun in the genitive case followed by a possessive-marked noun; we see that the CRF-LM model correctly marks this construction more frequently than the baseline. As example (3) in Fig. 3 shows, while neither model correctly translates ‘matkan’ (‘trip’) , the baseline’s output attributes the inessive ‘yhteydess’ (‘connection’) as belonging to ‘tulokset’ (‘results’) , and misses marking the possession linking it to ‘Commissioner Fischler’. Our manual evaluation shows that the CRF38 LM model is producing output translations that are more morphologically fluent than the wordbased baseline and the segmented translation Unsup L-match system, even though the word choices lead to a lower BLEU score overall when compared to Unsup L-match. 4 Related Work The work on morphology in MT can be grouped into three categories, factored models, segmented translation, and morphology generation. Factored models (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) factor the phrase translation probabilities over additional information annotated to each word, allowing for text to be represented on multiple levels of analysis. We discussed the drawbacks of factored models for our task in Section 2. 1. While (Koehn and Hoang, 2007; Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006; Avramidis and Koehn, 2008) obtain improvements using factored models for translation into English, German, Spanish, and Czech, these models may be less useful for capturing long-distance dependencies in languages with much more complex morphological systems such as Finnish. In our experiments factored models did worse than the baseline. Segmented translation performs morphological analysis on the morphologically complex text for use in the translation model (Brown et al. , 1993; Goldwater and McClosky, 2005; de Gispert and Mari n˜o, 2008) . This method unpacks complex forms into simpler, more frequently occurring components, and may also increase the symmetry of the lexically realized content be(1) Input: ‘the charter we are to approve today both strengthens and gives visible shape to the common fundamental rights and values our community is to be based upon. ’ a.

In a somewhat orthogonal approach to ours, (Ma et al. , 2007) use alignment of a parallel text to pack together adjacent segments in the alignment output, which are then fed back to the word aligner to bootstrap an improved alignment, which is then used in the translation model. We compared our results against (Luong et al. , 2010) in Table 3 since their results are directly comparable to ours. They use a segmented phrase table and language model along with the word-based versions in the decoder and in tuning a Finnish target. Their approach requires segmented phrases 39 to match word boundaries, eliminating morphologically productive phrases. In their work a segmented language model can score a translation, but cannot insert morphology that does not show source-side reflexes. In order to perform a similar experiment that still allowed for morphologically productive phrases, we tried training a segmented translation model, the output of which we stitched up in tuning so as to tune to a word-based reference. The goal of this experiment was to control the segmented model’s tendency to overfit by rewarding it for using correct whole-word forms. However, we found that this approach was less successful than using the segmented reference in tuning, and could not meet the baseline (13.97% BLEU best tuning score, versus 14.93% BLEU for the baseline best tuning score) . Previous work in segmented translation has often used linguistically motivated morphological analysis selectively applied based on a language-specific heuristic. A typical approach is to select a highly inflecting class of words and segment them for particular morphology (de Gispert and Mari n˜o, 2008; Ramanathan et al. , 2009) . Popovi¸ c and Ney (2004) perform segmentation to reduce morphological complexity of the source to translate into an isolating target, reducing the translation error rate for the English target. For Czech-to-English, Goldwater and McClosky (2005) lemmatized the source text and inserted a set of ‘pseudowords’ expected to have lexical reflexes in English. Minkov et. al. (2007) and Toutanova et. al. (2008) use a Maximum Entropy Markov Model for morphology generation. The main drawback to this approach is that it removes morphological information from the translation model (which only uses stems) ; this can be a problem for languages in which morphology ex- presses lexical content. de Gispert (2008) uses a language-specific targeted morphological classifier for Spanish verbs to avoid this issue. Talbot and Osborne (2006) use clustering to group morphological variants of words for word alignments and for smoothing phrase translation tables. Habash (2007) provides various methods to incorporate morphological variants of words in the phrase table in order to help recognize out of vocabulary words in the source language. 5 Conclusion and Future Work We found that using a segmented translation model based on unsupervised morphology induction and a model that combined morpheme segments in the translation model with a postprocessing morphology prediction model gave us better BLEU scores than a word-based baseline. Using our proposed approach we obtain better scores than the state of the art on the EnglishFinnish translation task (Luong et al. , 2010) : from 14.82% BLEU to 15.09%, while using a 40 simpler model. We show that using morphological segmentation in the translation model can improve output translation scores. We also demonstrate that for Finnish (and possibly other agglutinative languages) , phrase-based MT benefits from allowing the translation model access to morphological segmentation yielding productive morphological phrases. Taking advantage of linguistic analysis of the output we show that using a post-processing morphology generation model can improve translation fluency on a sub-word level, in a manner that is not captured by the BLEU word-based evaluation measure. In order to help with replication of the results in this paper, we have run the various morphological analysis steps and created the necessary training, tuning and test data files needed in order to train, tune and test any phrase-based machine translation system with our data. The files can be downloaded from natlang. cs.sfu. ca. In future work we hope to explore the utility of phrases with productive morpheme boundaries and explore why they are not used more pervasively in the decoder. Evaluation measures for morphologically complex languages and tun- ing to those measures are also important future work directions. Also, we would like to explore a non-pipelined approach to morphological preand post-processing so that a globally trained model could be used to remove the target side morphemes that would improve the translation model and then predict those morphemes in the target language.

<p>Author: Yoav Goldberg ; Michael Elhadad</p><p>Abstract: We experiment with extending a lattice parsing methodology for parsing Hebrew (Goldberg and Tsarfaty, 2008; Golderg et al., 2009) to make use of a stronger syntactic model: the PCFG-LA Berkeley Parser. We show that the methodology is very effective: using a small training set of about 5500 trees, we construct a parser which parses and segments unsegmented Hebrew text with an F-score of almost 80%, an error reduction of over 20% over the best previous result for this task.

<p>Author: John Lee ; Jason Naradowsky ; David A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: Most previous studies of morphological disambiguation and dependency parsing have been pursued independently. Morphological taggers operate on n-grams and do not take into account syntactic relations; parsers use the “pipeline” approach, assuming that morphological information has been separately obtained. However, in morphologically-rich languages, there is often considerable interaction between morphology and syntax, such that neither can be disambiguated without the other. In this paper, we propose a discriminative model that jointly infers morphological properties and syntactic structures. In evaluations on various highly-inflected languages, this joint model outperforms both a baseline tagger in morphological disambiguation, and a pipeline parser in head selection.</p><p>2 0.83261663 <a title="10-lsi-2" href="./acl-2011-Exploiting_Morphology_in_Turkish_Named_Entity_Recognition_System.html">124 acl-2011-Exploiting Morphology in Turkish Named Entity Recognition System</a></p>
<p>Author: Reyyan Yeniterzi</p><p>Abstract: Turkish is an agglutinative language with complex morphological structures, therefore using only word forms is not enough for many computational tasks. In this paper we analyze the effect of morphology in a Named Entity Recognition system for Turkish. We start with the standard word-level representation and incrementally explore the effect of capturing syntactic and contextual properties of tokens. Furthermore, we also explore a new representation in which roots and morphological features are represented as separate tokens instead of representing only words as tokens. Using syntactic and contextual properties with the new representation provide an 7.6% relative improvement over the baseline.</p><p>3 0.6929245 <a title="10-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-Joint_Hebrew_Segmentation_and_Parsing_using_a_PCFGLA_Lattice_Parser.html">184 acl-2011-Joint Hebrew Segmentation and Parsing using a PCFGLA Lattice Parser</a></p>

<p>Author: Klaus Macherey ; Andrew Dai ; David Talbot ; Ashok Popat ; Franz Och</p><p>Abstract: Translating compounds is an important problem in machine translation. Since many compounds have not been observed during training, they pose a challenge for translation systems. Previous decompounding methods have often been restricted to a small set of languages as they cannot deal with more complex compound forming processes. We present a novel and unsupervised method to learn the compound parts and morphological operations needed to split compounds into their compound parts. The method uses a bilingual corpus to learn the morphological operations required to split a compound into its parts. Furthermore, monolingual corpora are used to learn and filter the set of compound part candidates. We evaluate our method within a machine translation task and show significant improvements for various languages to show the versatility of the approach.</p><p>6 0.63220817 <a title="10-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Combining_Morpheme-based_Machine_Translation_with_Post-processing_Morpheme_Prediction.html">75 acl-2011-Combining Morpheme-based Machine Translation with Post-processing Morpheme Prediction</a></p>

<p>Author: Yabin Zheng ; Lixing Xie ; Zhiyuan Liu ; Maosong Sun ; Yang Zhang ; Liyun Ru</p><p>Abstract: Chinese Pinyin input method is very important for Chinese language information processing. Users may make errors when they are typing in Chinese words. In this paper, we are concerned with the reasons that cause the errors. Inspired by the observation that pressing backspace is one of the most common user behaviors to modify the errors, we collect 54, 309, 334 error-correction pairs from a realworld data set that contains 2, 277, 786 users via backspace operations. In addition, we present a comparative analysis of the data to achieve a better understanding of users’ input behaviors. Comparisons with English typos suggest that some language-specific properties result in a part of Chinese input errors. 1</p><p>5 0.65981042 <a title="10-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-A_Hierarchical_Model_of_Web_Summaries.html">14 acl-2011-A Hierarchical Model of Web Summaries</a></p>
<p>Author: Yves Petinot ; Kathleen McKeown ; Kapil Thadani</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the relevance of hierarchical topic models to represent the content of Web gists. We focus our attention on DMOZ, a popular Web directory, and propose two algorithms to infer such a model from its manually-curated hierarchy of categories. Our first approach, based on information-theoretic grounds, uses an algorithm similar to recursive feature selection. Our second approach is fully Bayesian and derived from the more general model, hierarchical LDA. We evaluate the performance of both models against a flat 1-gram baseline and show improvements in terms of perplexity over held-out data.</p><p>6 0.60575867 <a title="10-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Improving_Arabic_Dependency_Parsing_with_Form-based_and_Functional_Morphological_Features.html">164 acl-2011-Improving Arabic Dependency Parsing with Form-based and Functional Morphological Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Vicent Alabau ; Alberto Sanchis ; Francisco Casacuberta</p><p>Abstract: In interactive machine translation (IMT), a human expert is integrated into the core of a machine translation (MT) system. The human expert interacts with the IMT system by partially correcting the errors of the system’s output. Then, the system proposes a new solution. This process is repeated until the output meets the desired quality. In this scenario, the interaction is typically performed using the keyboard and the mouse. In this work, we present an alternative modality to interact within IMT systems by writing on a tactile display or using an electronic pen. An on-line handwritten text recognition (HTR) system has been specifically designed to operate with IMT systems. Our HTR system improves previous approaches in two main aspects. First, HTR decoding is tightly coupled with the IMT system. Second, the language models proposed are context aware, in the sense that they take into account the partial corrections and the source sentence by using a combination of ngrams and word-based IBM models. The proposed system achieves an important boost in performance with respect to previous work.</p><p>3 0.10578705 <a title="41-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Crowdsourcing_Translation%3A_Professional_Quality_from_Non-Professionals.html">90 acl-2011-Crowdsourcing Translation: Professional Quality from Non-Professionals</a></p>
<p>Author: Omar F. Zaidan ; Chris Callison-Burch</p><p>Abstract: Naively collecting translations by crowdsourcing the task to non-professional translators yields disfluent, low-quality results if no quality control is exercised. We demonstrate a variety of mechanisms that increase the translation quality to near professional levels. Specifically, we solicit redundant translations and edits to them, and automatically select the best output among them. We propose a set of features that model both the translations and the translators, such as country of residence, LM perplexity of the translation, edit rate from the other translations, and (optionally) calibration against professional translators. Using these features to score the collected translations, we are able to discriminate between acceptable and unacceptable translations. We recreate the NIST 2009 Urdu-toEnglish evaluation set with Mechanical Turk, and quantitatively show that our models are able to select translations within the range of quality that we expect from professional trans- lators. The total cost is more than an order of magnitude lower than professional translation.</p><p>4 0.082273506 <a title="41-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Consistent_Translation_using_Discriminative_Learning_-_A_Translation_Memory-inspired_Approach.html">81 acl-2011-Consistent Translation using Discriminative Learning - A Translation Memory-inspired Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Yanjun Ma ; Yifan He ; Andy Way ; Josef van Genabith</p><p>Abstract: We present a discriminative learning method to improve the consistency of translations in phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems. Our method is inspired by Translation Memory (TM) systems which are widely used by human translators in industrial settings. We constrain the translation of an input sentence using the most similar ‘translation example’ retrieved from the TM. Differently from previous research which used simple fuzzy match thresholds, these constraints are imposed using discriminative learning to optimise the translation performance. We observe that using this method can benefit the SMT system by not only producing consistent translations, but also improved translation outputs. We report a 0.9 point improvement in terms of BLEU score on English–Chinese technical documents.</p><p>5 0.081081524 <a title="41-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-MEANT%3A_An_inexpensive%2C_high-accuracy%2C_semi-automatic_metric_for_evaluating_translation_utility_based_on_semantic_roles.html">216 acl-2011-MEANT: An inexpensive, high-accuracy, semi-automatic metric for evaluating translation utility based on semantic roles</a></p>
<p>Author: Chi-kiu Lo ; Dekai Wu</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel semi-automated metric, MEANT, that assesses translation utility by matching semantic role fillers, producing scores that correlate with human judgment as well as HTER but at much lower labor cost. As machine translation systems improve in lexical choice and fluency, the shortcomings of widespread n-gram based, fluency-oriented MT evaluation metrics such as BLEU, which fail to properly evaluate adequacy, become more apparent. But more accurate, nonautomatic adequacy-oriented MT evaluation metrics like HTER are highly labor-intensive, which bottlenecks the evaluation cycle. We first show that when using untrained monolingual readers to annotate semantic roles in MT output, the non-automatic version of the metric HMEANT achieves a 0.43 correlation coefficient with human adequacyjudgments at the sentence level, far superior to BLEU at only 0.20, and equal to the far more expensive HTER. We then replace the human semantic role annotators with automatic shallow semantic parsing to further automate the evaluation metric, and show that even the semiautomated evaluation metric achieves a 0.34 correlation coefficient with human adequacy judgment, which is still about 80% as closely correlated as HTER despite an even lower labor cost for the evaluation procedure. The results show that our proposed metric is significantly better correlated with human judgment on adequacy than current widespread automatic evaluation metrics, while being much more cost effective than HTER. 1</p><p>6 0.078432105 <a title="41-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Rare_Word_Translation_Extraction_from_Aligned_Comparable_Documents.html">259 acl-2011-Rare Word Translation Extraction from Aligned Comparable Documents</a></p>

<p>Author: Jesus Gonzalez-Rubio ; Alfons Juan ; Francisco Casacuberta</p><p>Abstract: We present minimum Bayes-risk system combination, a method that integrates consensus decoding and system combination into a unified multi-system minimum Bayes-risk (MBR) technique. Unlike other MBR methods that re-rank translations of a single SMT system, MBR system combination uses the MBR decision rule and a linear combination of the component systems’ probability distributions to search for the minimum risk translation among all the finite-length strings over the output vocabulary. We introduce expected BLEU, an approximation to the BLEU score that allows to efficiently apply MBR in these conditions. MBR system combination is a general method that is independent of specific SMT models, enabling us to combine systems with heterogeneous structure. Experiments show that our approach bring significant improvements to single-system-based MBR decoding and achieves comparable results to different state-of-the-art system combination methods.</p><p>4 0.30958676 <a title="41-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Hypothesis_Mixture_Decoding_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">155 acl-2011-Hypothesis Mixture Decoding for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Nan Duan ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents hypothesis mixture decoding (HM decoding), a new decoding scheme that performs translation reconstruction using hypotheses generated by multiple translation systems. HM decoding involves two decoding stages: first, each component system decodes independently, with the explored search space kept for use in the next step; second, a new search space is constructed by composing existing hypotheses produced by all component systems using a set of rules provided by the HM decoder itself, and a new set of model independent features are used to seek the final best translation from this new search space. Few assumptions are made by our approach about the underlying component systems, enabling us to leverage SMT models based on arbitrary paradigms. We compare our approach with several related techniques, and demonstrate significant BLEU improvements in large-scale Chinese-to-English translation tasks.</p><p>5 0.27410403 <a title="41-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Blast%3A_A_Tool_for_Error_Analysis_of_Machine_Translation_Output.html">62 acl-2011-Blast: A Tool for Error Analysis of Machine Translation Output</a></p>
<p>Author: Sara Stymne</p><p>Abstract: We present BLAST, an open source tool for error analysis of machine translation (MT) output. We believe that error analysis, i.e., to identify and classify MT errors, should be an integral part ofMT development, since it gives a qualitative view, which is not obtained by standard evaluation methods. BLAST can aid MT researchers and users in this process, by providing an easy-to-use graphical user interface. It is designed to be flexible, and can be used with any MT system, language pair, and error typology. The annotation task can be aided by highlighting similarities with a reference translation.</p><p>6 0.26034975 <a title="41-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Hindi_to_Punjabi_Machine_Translation_System.html">151 acl-2011-Hindi to Punjabi Machine Translation System</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuval Marton ; Nizar Habash ; Owen Rambow</p><p>Abstract: We explore the contribution of morphological features both lexical and inflectional to dependency parsing of Arabic, a morphologically rich language. Using controlled experiments, we find that definiteness, person, number, gender, and the undiacritzed lemma are most helpful for parsing on automatically tagged input. We further contrast the contribution of form-based and functional features, and show that functional gender and number (e.g., “broken plurals”) and the related rationality feature improve over form-based features. It is the first time functional morphological features are used for Arabic NLP. – –</p><p>4 0.61094666 <a title="41-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Contrasting_Opposing_Views_of_News_Articles_on_Contentious_Issues.html">84 acl-2011-Contrasting Opposing Views of News Articles on Contentious Issues</a></p>
<p>Author: Souneil Park ; Kyung Soon Lee ; Junehwa Song</p><p>Abstract: We present disputant relation-based method for classifying news articles on contentious issues. We observe that the disputants of a contention are an important feature for understanding the discourse. It performs unsupervised classification on news articles based on disputant relations, and helps readers intuitively view the articles through the opponent-based frame. The readers can attain balanced understanding on the contention, free from a specific biased view. We applied a modified version of HITS algorithm and an SVM classifier trained with pseudo-relevant data for article analysis. 1</p><p>5 0.57661295 <a title="41-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-P11-2093_k2opt.pdf.html">238 acl-2011-P11-2093 k2opt.pdf</a></p>
<p>Author: empty-author</p><p>Abstract: We present a pointwise approach to Japanese morphological analysis (MA) that ignores structure information during learning and tagging. Despite the lack of structure, it is able to outperform the current state-of-the-art structured approach for Japanese MA, and achieves accuracy similar to that of structured predictors using the same feature set. We also find that the method is both robust to outof-domain data, and can be easily adapted through the use of a combination of partial annotation and active learning.</p><p>6 0.46876469 <a title="41-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Optimal_and_Syntactically-Informed_Decoding_for_Monolingual_Phrase-Based_Alignment.html">235 acl-2011-Optimal and Syntactically-Informed Decoding for Monolingual Phrase-Based Alignment</a></p>

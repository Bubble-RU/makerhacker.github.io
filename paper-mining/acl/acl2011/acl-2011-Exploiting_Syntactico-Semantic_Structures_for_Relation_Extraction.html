<p>Author: Hamidreza Kobdani ; Hinrich Schuetze ; Michael Schiehlen ; Hans Kamp</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an unsupervised framework that bootstraps a complete coreference resolution (CoRe) system from word associations mined from a large unlabeled corpus. We show that word associations are useful for CoRe – e.g., the strong association between Obama and President is an indicator of likely coreference. Association information has so far not been used in CoRe because it is sparse and difficult to learn from small labeled corpora. Since unlabeled text is readily available, our unsupervised approach addresses the sparseness problem. In a self-training framework, we train a decision tree on a corpus that is automatically labeled using word associations. We show that this unsupervised system has better CoRe performance than other learning approaches that do not use manually labeled data. .</p><p>4 0.14190504 <a title="126-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Enhancing_Language_Models_in_Statistical_Machine_Translation_with_Backward_N-grams_and_Mutual_Information_Triggers.html">116 acl-2011-Enhancing Language Models in Statistical Machine Translation with Backward N-grams and Mutual Information Triggers</a></p>
<p>Author: Deyi Xiong ; Min Zhang ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, with a belief that a language model that embraces a larger context provides better prediction ability, we present two extensions to standard n-gram language models in statistical machine translation: a backward language model that augments the conventional forward language model, and a mutual information trigger model which captures long-distance dependencies that go beyond the scope of standard n-gram language models. We integrate the two proposed models into phrase-based statistical machine translation and conduct experiments on large-scale training data to investigate their effectiveness. Our experimental results show that both models are able to significantly improve transla- , tion quality and collectively achieve up to 1 BLEU point over a competitive baseline.</p><p>5 0.13983068 <a title="126-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-A_Generative_Entity-Mention_Model_for_Linking_Entities_with_Knowledge_Base.html">12 acl-2011-A Generative Entity-Mention Model for Linking Entities with Knowledge Base</a></p>
<p>Author: Xianpei Han ; Le Sun</p><p>Abstract: Linking entities with knowledge base (entity linking) is a key issue in bridging the textual data with the structural knowledge base. Due to the name variation problem and the name ambiguity problem, the entity linking decisions are critically depending on the heterogenous knowledge of entities. In this paper, we propose a generative probabilistic model, called entitymention model, which can leverage heterogenous entity knowledge (including popularity knowledge, name knowledge and context knowledge) for the entity linking task. In our model, each name mention to be linked is modeled as a sample generated through a three-step generative story, and the entity knowledge is encoded in the distribution of entities in document P(e), the distribution of possible names of a specific entity P(s|e), and the distribution of possible contexts of a specific entity P(c|e). To find the referent entity of a name mention, our method combines the evidences from all the three distributions P(e), P(s|e) and P(c|e). Experimental results show that our method can significantly outperform the traditional methods. 1</p><p>6 0.11593343 <a title="126-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Large-Scale_Cross-Document_Coreference_Using_Distributed_Inference_and_Hierarchical_Models.html">196 acl-2011-Large-Scale Cross-Document Coreference Using Distributed Inference and Hierarchical Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Sameer Singh ; Amarnag Subramanya ; Fernando Pereira ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: Cross-document coreference, the task of grouping all the mentions of each entity in a document collection, arises in information extraction and automated knowledge base construction. For large collections, it is clearly impractical to consider all possible groupings of mentions into distinct entities. To solve the problem we propose two ideas: (a) a distributed inference technique that uses parallelism to enable large scale processing, and (b) a hierarchical model of coreference that represents uncertainty over multiple granularities of entities to facilitate more effective approximate inference. To evaluate these ideas, we constructed a labeled corpus of 1.5 million disambiguated mentions in Web pages by selecting link anchors referring to Wikipedia entities. We show that the combination of the hierarchical model with distributed inference quickly obtains high accuracy (with error reduction of 38%) on this large dataset, demonstrating the scalability of our approach.</p><p>3 0.64495343 <a title="126-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-Semi-supervised_Relation_Extraction_with_Large-scale_Word_Clustering.html">277 acl-2011-Semi-supervised Relation Extraction with Large-scale Word Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Yu Hong ; Jianfeng Zhang ; Bin Ma ; Jianmin Yao ; Guodong Zhou ; Qiaoming Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Event extraction is the task of detecting certain specified types of events that are mentioned in the source language data. The state-of-the-art research on the task is transductive inference (e.g. cross-event inference). In this paper, we propose a new method of event extraction by well using cross-entity inference. In contrast to previous inference methods, we regard entitytype consistency as key feature to predict event mentions. We adopt this inference method to improve the traditional sentence-level event extraction system. Experiments show that we can get 8.6% gain in trigger (event) identification, and more than 11.8% gain for argument (role) classification in ACE event extraction. 1</p><p>5 0.60261196 <a title="126-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Knowledge-Based_Weak_Supervision_for_Information_Extraction_of_Overlapping_Relations.html">190 acl-2011-Knowledge-Based Weak Supervision for Information Extraction of Overlapping Relations</a></p>
<p>Author: Raphael Hoffmann ; Congle Zhang ; Xiao Ling ; Luke Zettlemoyer ; Daniel S. Weld</p><p>Abstract: Information extraction (IE) holds the promise of generating a large-scale knowledge base from the Web’s natural language text. Knowledge-based weak supervision, using structured data to heuristically label a training corpus, works towards this goal by enabling the automated learning of a potentially unbounded number of relation extractors. Recently, researchers have developed multiinstance learning algorithms to combat the noisy training data that can come from heuristic labeling, but their models assume relations are disjoint — for example they cannot extract the pair Founded ( Jobs Apple ) and CEO-o f ( Jobs Apple ) . , , This paper presents a novel approach for multi-instance learning with overlapping relations that combines a sentence-level extrac- , tion model with a simple, corpus-level component for aggregating the individual facts. We apply our model to learn extractors for NY Times text using weak supervision from Freebase. Experiments show that the approach runs quickly and yields surprising gains in accuracy, at both the aggregate and sentence level.</p><p>6 0.59532142 <a title="126-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-A_Generative_Entity-Mention_Model_for_Linking_Entities_with_Knowledge_Base.html">12 acl-2011-A Generative Entity-Mention Model for Linking Entities with Knowledge Base</a></p>

The composite language model has been trained by performing a convergent N-best list approximate EM algorithm that has linear time complexity and a followup EM algorithm to improve word prediction power on corpora with up to a billion tokens and stored on a supercomputer. The large scale distributed composite language model gives drastic perplexity reduction over ngrams and achieves significantly better translation quality measured by the BLEU score and “readability” when applied to the task of re-ranking the N-best list from a state-of-the- art parsing-based machine translation system.</p><p>3 0.96015435 <a title="126-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Entity_Set_Expansion_using_Topic_information.html">117 acl-2011-Entity Set Expansion using Topic information</a></p>

MMGs typically involve groups of players (5-30) who control their perform various activities (questing, competing, fighting, etc.) and communicate via chat or speech using assumed screen names. We collected a corpus of 48 group quests in Second Life that jointly involved 206 players who generated over 30,000 messages in quasisynchronous chat during approximately 140 hours of recorded action. Multiple levels of coordinated annotation of this corpus (dialogue, movements, touch, gaze, wear, etc) are required in order to support development of automated predictors of selected real-life social and demographic characteristics of the players. The annotation tool presented in this paper was developed to enable efficient and accurate annotation of all dimensions simultaneously. avatars1, 1</p><p>6 0.93108386 <a title="126-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-In-domain_Relation_Discovery_with_Meta-constraints_via_Posterior_Regularization.html">170 acl-2011-In-domain Relation Discovery with Meta-constraints via Posterior Regularization</a></p>

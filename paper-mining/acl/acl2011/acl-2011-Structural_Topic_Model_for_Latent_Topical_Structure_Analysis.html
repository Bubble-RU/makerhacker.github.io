<p>Author: Ivan Titov</p><p>Abstract: We consider a semi-supervised setting for domain adaptation where only unlabeled data is available for the target domain. One way to tackle this problem is to train a generative model with latent variables on the mixture of data from the source and target domains. Such a model would cluster features in both domains and ensure that at least some of the latent variables are predictive of the label on the source domain. The danger is that these predictive clusters will consist of features specific to the source domain only and, consequently, a classifier relying on such clusters would perform badly on the target domain. We introduce a constraint enforcing that marginal distributions of each cluster (i.e., each latent variable) do not vary significantly across domains. We show that this constraint is effec- tive on the sentiment classification task (Pang et al., 2002), resulting in scores similar to the ones obtained by the structural correspondence methods (Blitzer et al., 2007) without the need to engineer auxiliary tasks.</p><p>3 0.11952259 <a title="287-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-A_Latent_Topic_Extracting_Method_based_on_Events_in_a_Document_and_its_Application.html">18 acl-2011-A Latent Topic Extracting Method based on Events in a Document and its Application</a></p>
<p>Author: Risa Kitajima ; Ichiro Kobayashi</p><p>Abstract: Recently, several latent topic analysis methods such as LSI, pLSI, and LDA have been widely used for text analysis. However, those methods basically assign topics to words, but do not account for the events in a document. With this background, in this paper, we propose a latent topic extracting method which assigns topics to events. We also show that our proposed method is useful to generate a document summary based on a latent topic.</p><p>4 0.11933385 <a title="287-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Discovery_of_Topically_Coherent_Sentences_for_Extractive_Summarization.html">98 acl-2011-Discovery of Topically Coherent Sentences for Extractive Summarization</a></p>
<p>Author: Asli Celikyilmaz ; Dilek Hakkani-Tur</p><p>Abstract: Extractive methods for multi-document summarization are mainly governed by information overlap, coherence, and content constraints. We present an unsupervised probabilistic approach to model the hidden abstract concepts across documents as well as the correlation between these concepts, to generate topically coherent and non-redundant summaries. Based on human evaluations our models generate summaries with higher linguistic quality in terms of coherence, readability, and redundancy compared to benchmark systems. Although our system is unsupervised and optimized for topical coherence, we achieve a 44.1 ROUGE on the DUC-07 test set, roughly in the range of state-of-the-art supervised models.</p><p>5 0.11874302 <a title="287-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Automatic_Labelling_of_Topic_Models.html">52 acl-2011-Automatic Labelling of Topic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jey Han Lau ; Karl Grieser ; David Newman ; Timothy Baldwin</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for automatically labelling topics learned via LDA topic models. We generate our label candidate set from the top-ranking topic terms, titles of Wikipedia articles containing the top-ranking topic terms, and sub-phrases extracted from the Wikipedia article titles. We rank the label candidates using a combination of association measures and lexical features, optionally fed into a supervised ranking model. Our method is shown to perform strongly over four independent sets of topics, significantly better than a benchmark method.</p><p>6 0.11721673 <a title="287-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Identifying_Word_Translations_from_Comparable_Corpora_Using_Latent_Topic_Models.html">161 acl-2011-Identifying Word Translations from Comparable Corpora Using Latent Topic Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuening Hu ; Jordan Boyd-Graber ; Brianna Satinoff</p><p>Abstract: Topic models have been used extensively as a tool for corpus exploration, and a cottage industry has developed to tweak topic models to better encode human intuitions or to better model data. However, creating such extensions requires expertise in machine learning unavailable to potential end-users of topic modeling software. In this work, we develop a framework for allowing users to iteratively refine the topics discovered by models such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) by adding constraints that enforce that sets of words must appear together in the same topic. We incorporate these constraints interactively by selectively removing elements in the state of a Markov Chain used for inference; we investigate a variety of methods for incorporating this information and demonstrate that these interactively added constraints improve topic usefulness for simulated and actual user sessions.</p><p>3 0.83697128 <a title="287-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-A_Hierarchical_Model_of_Web_Summaries.html">14 acl-2011-A Hierarchical Model of Web Summaries</a></p>
<p>Author: Yves Petinot ; Kathleen McKeown ; Kapil Thadani</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the relevance of hierarchical topic models to represent the content of Web gists. We focus our attention on DMOZ, a popular Web directory, and propose two algorithms to infer such a model from its manually-curated hierarchy of categories. Our first approach, based on information-theoretic grounds, uses an algorithm similar to recursive feature selection. Our second approach is fully Bayesian and derived from the more general model, hierarchical LDA. We evaluate the performance of both models against a flat 1-gram baseline and show improvements in terms of perplexity over held-out data.</p><p>4 0.8233099 <a title="287-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-A_Latent_Topic_Extracting_Method_based_on_Events_in_a_Document_and_its_Application.html">18 acl-2011-A Latent Topic Extracting Method based on Events in a Document and its Application</a></p>

<p>Author: Harr Chen ; Edward Benson ; Tahira Naseem ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to discovering relations and their instantiations from a collection of documents in a single domain. Our approach learns relation types by exploiting meta-constraints that characterize the general qualities of a good relation in any domain. These constraints state that instances of a single relation should exhibit regularities at multiple levels of linguistic structure, including lexicography, syntax, and document-level context. We capture these regularities via the structure of our probabilistic model as well as a set of declaratively-specified constraints enforced during posterior inference. Across two domains our approach successfully recovers hidden relation structure, comparable to or outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we find that a small , set of constraints is applicable across the domains, and that using domain-specific constraints can further improve performance. 1</p><p>5 0.82507306 <a title="287-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Entrainment_in_Speech_Preceding_Backchannels..html">118 acl-2011-Entrainment in Speech Preceding Backchannels.</a></p>
<p>Author: Rivka Levitan ; Agustin Gravano ; Julia Hirschberg</p><p>Abstract: In conversation, when speech is followed by a backchannel, evidence of continued engagement by one’s dialogue partner, that speech displays a combination of cues that appear to signal to one’s interlocutor that a backchannel is appropriate. We term these cues backchannel-preceding cues (BPC)s, and examine the Columbia Games Corpus for evidence of entrainment on such cues. Entrainment, the phenomenon of dialogue partners becoming more similar to each other, is widely believed to be crucial to conversation quality and success. Our results show that speaking partners entrain on BPCs; that is, they tend to use similar sets of BPCs; this similarity increases over the course of a dialogue; and this similarity is associated with measures of dialogue coordination and task success. 1</p><p>6 0.82121795 <a title="287-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Exploiting_Syntactico-Semantic_Structures_for_Relation_Extraction.html">126 acl-2011-Exploiting Syntactico-Semantic Structures for Relation Extraction</a></p>

<p>Author: Long Jiang ; Mo Yu ; Ming Zhou ; Xiaohua Liu ; Tiejun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: Sentiment analysis on Twitter data has attracted much attention recently. In this paper, we focus on target-dependent Twitter sentiment classification; namely, given a query, we classify the sentiments of the tweets as positive, negative or neutral according to whether they contain positive, negative or neutral sentiments about that query. Here the query serves as the target of the sentiments. The state-ofthe-art approaches for solving this problem always adopt the target-independent strategy, which may assign irrelevant sentiments to the given target. Moreover, the state-of-the-art approaches only take the tweet to be classified into consideration when classifying the sentiment; they ignore its context (i.e., related tweets). However, because tweets are usually short and more ambiguous, sometimes it is not enough to consider only the current tweet for sentiment classification. In this paper, we propose to improve target-dependent Twitter sentiment classification by 1) incorporating target-dependent features; and 2) taking related tweets into consideration. According to the experimental results, our approach greatly improves the performance of target-dependent sentiment classification. 1</p><p>3 0.5224027 <a title="64-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Identifying_Sarcasm_in_Twitter%3A_A_Closer_Look.html">160 acl-2011-Identifying Sarcasm in Twitter: A Closer Look</a></p>
<p>Author: Roberto Gonzalez-Ibanez ; Smaranda Muresan ; Nina Wacholder</p><p>Abstract: Sarcasm transforms the polarity of an apparently positive or negative utterance into its opposite. We report on a method for constructing a corpus of sarcastic Twitter messages in which determination of the sarcasm of each message has been made by its author. We use this reliable corpus to compare sarcastic utterances in Twitter to utterances that express positive or negative attitudes without sarcasm. We investigate the impact of lexical and pragmatic factors on machine learning effectiveness for identifying sarcastic utterances and we compare the performance of machine learning techniques and human judges on this task. Perhaps unsurprisingly, neither the human judges nor the machine learning techniques perform very well. 1</p><p>4 0.47442815 <a title="64-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Interactive_Group_Suggesting_for_Twitter.html">177 acl-2011-Interactive Group Suggesting for Twitter</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhonghua Qu ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: The number of users on Twitter has drastically increased in the past years. However, Twitter does not have an effective user grouping mechanism. Therefore tweets from other users can quickly overrun and become inconvenient to read. In this paper, we propose methods to help users group the people they follow using their provided seeding users. Two sources of information are used to build sub-systems: textural information captured by the tweets sent by users, and social connections among users. We also propose a measure of fitness to determine which subsystem best represents the seed users and use it for target user ranking. Our experiments show that our proposed framework works well and that adaptively choosing the appropriate sub-system for group suggestion results in increased accuracy.</p><p>5 0.46105325 <a title="64-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Recognizing_Named_Entities_in_Tweets.html">261 acl-2011-Recognizing Named Entities in Tweets</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaohua LIU ; Shaodian ZHANG ; Furu WEI ; Ming ZHOU</p><p>Abstract: The challenges of Named Entities Recognition (NER) for tweets lie in the insufficient information in a tweet and the unavailability of training data. We propose to combine a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier with a linear Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model under a semi-supervised learning framework to tackle these challenges. The KNN based classifier conducts pre-labeling to collect global coarse evidence across tweets while the CRF model conducts sequential labeling to capture fine-grained information encoded in a tweet. The semi-supervised learning plus the gazetteers alleviate the lack of training data.

<p>Author: Wei-Bin Liang ; Chung-Hsien Wu ; Chia-Ping Chen</p><p>Abstract: In this study, a novel approach to robust dialogue act detection for error-prone speech recognition in a spoken dialogue system is proposed. First, partial sentence trees are proposed to represent a speech recognition output sentence. Semantic information and the derivation rules of the partial sentence trees are extracted and used to model the relationship between the dialogue acts and the derivation rules. The constructed model is then used to generate a semantic score for dialogue act detection given an input speech utterance. The proposed approach is implemented and evaluated in a Mandarin spoken dialogue system for tour-guiding service. Combined with scores derived from the ASR recognition probability and the dialogue history, the proposed approach achieves 84.3% detection accuracy, an absolute improvement of 34.7% over the baseline of the semantic slot-based method with 49.6% detection accuracy.</p><p>3 0.63677788 <a title="64-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Using_Large_Monolingual_and_Bilingual_Corpora_to_Improve_Coordination_Disambiguation.html">331 acl-2011-Using Large Monolingual and Bilingual Corpora to Improve Coordination Disambiguation</a></p>
<p>Author: Shane Bergsma ; David Yarowsky ; Kenneth Church</p><p>Abstract: Resolving coordination ambiguity is a classic hard problem. This paper looks at coordination disambiguation in complex noun phrases (NPs). Parsers trained on the Penn Treebank are reporting impressive numbers these days, but they don’t do very well on this problem (79%). We explore systems trained using three types of corpora: (1) annotated (e.g. the Penn Treebank), (2) bitexts (e.g. Europarl), and (3) unannotated monolingual (e.g. Google N-grams). Size matters: (1) is a million words, (2) is potentially billions of words and (3) is potentially trillions of words. The unannotated monolingual data is helpful when the ambiguity can be resolved through associations among the lexical items. The bilingual data is helpful when the ambiguity can be resolved by the order of words in the translation. We train separate classifiers with monolingual and bilingual features and iteratively improve them via achieves data and pervised tations. co-training. The co-trained classifier close to 96% accuracy on Treebank makes 20% fewer errors than a susystem trained with Treebank anno-</p><p>4 0.62840009 <a title="64-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Monolingual_Alignment_by_Edit_Rate_Computation_on_Sentential_Paraphrase_Pairs.html">225 acl-2011-Monolingual Alignment by Edit Rate Computation on Sentential Paraphrase Pairs</a></p>

In order to inform the edit rate, information in the form of subsentential paraphrases is provided by a range of techniques built for different purposes. We show that the tunable TER-PLUS metric from Machine Translation evaluation can achieve good performance on this task and that it can effectively exploit information coming from complementary sources.</p><p>5 0.55607826 <a title="64-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Joint_Bilingual_Sentiment_Classification_with_Unlabeled_Parallel_Corpora.html">183 acl-2011-Joint Bilingual Sentiment Classification with Unlabeled Parallel Corpora</a></p>
<p>Author: Bin Lu ; Chenhao Tan ; Claire Cardie ; Benjamin K. Tsou</p><p>Abstract: Most previous work on multilingual sentiment analysis has focused on methods to adapt sentiment resources from resource-rich languages to resource-poor languages. We present a novel approach for joint bilingual sentiment classification at the sentence level that augments available labeled data in each language with unlabeled parallel data. We rely on the intuition that the sentiment labels for parallel sentences should be similar and present a model that jointly learns improved monolingual sentiment classifiers for each language. Experiments on multiple data sets show that the proposed approach (1) outperforms the monolingual baselines, significantly improving the accuracy for both languages by 3.44%-8. 12%; (2) outperforms two standard approaches for leveraging unlabeled data; and (3) produces (albeit smaller) performance gains when employing pseudo-parallel data from machine translation engines. 1</p><p>6 0.55515236 <a title="64-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-PsychoSentiWordNet.html">253 acl-2011-PsychoSentiWordNet</a></p>

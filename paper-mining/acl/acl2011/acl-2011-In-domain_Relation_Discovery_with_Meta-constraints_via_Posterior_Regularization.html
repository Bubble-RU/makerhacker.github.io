<p>Author: Yuening Hu ; Jordan Boyd-Graber ; Brianna Satinoff</p><p>Abstract: Topic models have been used extensively as a tool for corpus exploration, and a cottage industry has developed to tweak topic models to better encode human intuitions or to better model data. However, creating such extensions requires expertise in machine learning unavailable to potential end-users of topic modeling software. In this work, we develop a framework for allowing users to iteratively refine the topics discovered by models such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) by adding constraints that enforce that sets of words must appear together in the same topic. We incorporate these constraints interactively by selectively removing elements in the state of a Markov Chain used for inference; we investigate a variety of methods for incorporating this information and demonstrate that these interactively added constraints improve topic usefulness for simulated and actual user sessions.</p><p>3 0.20320933 <a title="170-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-A_Bayesian_Model_for_Unsupervised_Semantic_Parsing.html">3 acl-2011-A Bayesian Model for Unsupervised Semantic Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Ivan Titov ; Alexandre Klementiev</p><p>Abstract: We propose a non-parametric Bayesian model for unsupervised semantic parsing. Following Poon and Domingos (2009), we consider a semantic parsing setting where the goal is to (1) decompose the syntactic dependency tree of a sentence into fragments, (2) assign each of these fragments to a cluster of semantically equivalent syntactic structures, and (3) predict predicate-argument relations between the fragments. We use hierarchical PitmanYor processes to model statistical dependencies between meaning representations of predicates and those of their arguments, as well as the clusters of their syntactic realizations. We develop a modification of the MetropolisHastings split-merge sampler, resulting in an efficient inference algorithm for the model. The method is experimentally evaluated by us- ing the induced semantic representation for the question answering task in the biomedical domain.</p><p>4 0.18669155 <a title="170-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Unsupervised_Semantic_Role_Induction_via_Split-Merge_Clustering.html">324 acl-2011-Unsupervised Semantic Role Induction via Split-Merge Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Joel Lang ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we describe an unsupervised method for semantic role induction which holds promise for relieving the data acquisition bottleneck associated with supervised role labelers. We present an algorithm that iteratively splits and merges clusters representing semantic roles, thereby leading from an initial clustering to a final clustering of better quality. The method is simple, surprisingly effective, and allows to integrate linguistic knowledge transparently. By combining role induction with a rule-based component for argument identification we obtain an unsupervised end-to-end semantic role labeling system. Evaluation on the CoNLL 2008 benchmark dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms competitive unsupervised approaches by a wide margin.</p><p>5 0.154523 <a title="170-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Domain_Adaptation_by_Constraining_Inter-Domain_Variability_of_Latent_Feature_Representation.html">103 acl-2011-Domain Adaptation by Constraining Inter-Domain Variability of Latent Feature Representation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ivan Titov</p><p>Abstract: We consider a semi-supervised setting for domain adaptation where only unlabeled data is available for the target domain. One way to tackle this problem is to train a generative model with latent variables on the mixture of data from the source and target domains. Such a model would cluster features in both domains and ensure that at least some of the latent variables are predictive of the label on the source domain. The danger is that these predictive clusters will consist of features specific to the source domain only and, consequently, a classifier relying on such clusters would perform badly on the target domain. We introduce a constraint enforcing that marginal distributions of each cluster (i.e., each latent variable) do not vary significantly across domains. We show that this constraint is effec- tive on the sentiment classification task (Pang et al., 2002), resulting in scores similar to the ones obtained by the structural correspondence methods (Blitzer et al., 2007) without the need to engineer auxiliary tasks.</p><p>6 0.14568533 <a title="170-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Can_Document_Selection_Help_Semi-supervised_Learning%3F_A_Case_Study_On_Event_Extraction.html">65 acl-2011-Can Document Selection Help Semi-supervised Learning?

<p>Author: Raphael Hoffmann ; Congle Zhang ; Xiao Ling ; Luke Zettlemoyer ; Daniel S. Weld</p><p>Abstract: Information extraction (IE) holds the promise of generating a large-scale knowledge base from the Web’s natural language text. Knowledge-based weak supervision, using structured data to heuristically label a training corpus, works towards this goal by enabling the automated learning of a potentially unbounded number of relation extractors. Recently, researchers have developed multiinstance learning algorithms to combat the noisy training data that can come from heuristic labeling, but their models assume relations are disjoint — for example they cannot extract the pair Founded ( Jobs Apple ) and CEO-o f ( Jobs Apple ) . , , This paper presents a novel approach for multi-instance learning with overlapping relations that combines a sentence-level extrac- , tion model with a simple, corpus-level component for aggregating the individual facts. We apply our model to learn extractors for NY Times text using weak supervision from Freebase. Experiments show that the approach runs quickly and yields surprising gains in accuracy, at both the aggregate and sentence level.</p><p>5 0.69984841 <a title="170-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-A_Bayesian_Model_for_Unsupervised_Semantic_Parsing.html">3 acl-2011-A Bayesian Model for Unsupervised Semantic Parsing</a></p>

We develop a novel hidden Markov model incorporating sophisticated smoothing using a hierarchical Pitman-Yor processes prior, providing an elegant and principled means of incorporating lexical characteristics. Central to our approach is a new type-based sampling algorithm for hierarchical Pitman-Yor models in which we track fractional table counts. In an empirical evaluation we show that our model consistently out-performs the current state-of-the-art across 10 languages.</p><p>3 0.94905823 <a title="170-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-A_Large_Scale_Distributed_Syntactic%2C_Semantic_and_Lexical_Language_Model_for_Machine_Translation.html">17 acl-2011-A Large Scale Distributed Syntactic, Semantic and Lexical Language Model for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ming Tan ; Wenli Zhou ; Lei Zheng ; Shaojun Wang</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an attempt at building a large scale distributed composite language model that simultaneously accounts for local word lexical information, mid-range sentence syntactic structure, and long-span document semantic content under a directed Markov random field paradigm. The composite language model has been trained by performing a convergent N-best list approximate EM algorithm that has linear time complexity and a followup EM algorithm to improve word prediction power on corpora with up to a billion tokens and stored on a supercomputer. The large scale distributed composite language model gives drastic perplexity reduction over ngrams and achieves significantly better translation quality measured by the BLEU score and “readability” when applied to the task of re-ranking the N-best list from a state-of-the- art parsing-based machine translation system.</p><p>4 0.94797426 <a title="170-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Multi-Modal_Annotation_of_Quest_Games_in_Second_Life.html">226 acl-2011-Multi-Modal Annotation of Quest Games in Second Life</a></p>
<p>Author: Sharon Gower Small ; Jennifer Strommer-Galley ; Tomek Strzalkowski</p><p>Abstract: We describe an annotation tool developed to assist in the creation of multimodal actioncommunication corpora from on-line massively multi-player games, or MMGs. MMGs typically involve groups of players (5-30) who control their perform various activities (questing, competing, fighting, etc.) and communicate via chat or speech using assumed screen names. We collected a corpus of 48 group quests in Second Life that jointly involved 206 players who generated over 30,000 messages in quasisynchronous chat during approximately 140 hours of recorded action. Multiple levels of coordinated annotation of this corpus (dialogue, movements, touch, gaze, wear, etc) are required in order to support development of automated predictors of selected real-life social and demographic characteristics of the players. The annotation tool presented in this paper was developed to enable efficient and accurate annotation of all dimensions simultaneously. avatars1, 1</p><p>5 0.94602096 <a title="170-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Exploiting_Syntactico-Semantic_Structures_for_Relation_Extraction.html">126 acl-2011-Exploiting Syntactico-Semantic Structures for Relation Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Yee Seng Chan ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we observe that there exists a second dimension to the relation extraction (RE) problem that is orthogonal to the relation type dimension. We show that most of these second dimensional structures are relatively constrained and not difficult to identify. We propose a novel algorithmic approach to RE that starts by first identifying these structures and then, within these, identifying the semantic type of the relation. In the real RE problem where relation arguments need to be identified, exploiting these structures also allows reducing pipelined propagated errors. We show that this RE framework provides significant improvement in RE performance.</p><p>6 0.94535708 <a title="170-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Entity_Set_Expansion_using_Topic_information.html">117 acl-2011-Entity Set Expansion using Topic information</a></p>

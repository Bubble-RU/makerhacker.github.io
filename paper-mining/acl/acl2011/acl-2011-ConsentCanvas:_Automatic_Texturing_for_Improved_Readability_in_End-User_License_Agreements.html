<p>Author: Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi ; Hal Daume III ; Raghavendra Udupa</p><p>Abstract: Mapping documents into an interlingual representation can help bridge the language barrier of a cross-lingual corpus. Previous approaches use aligned documents as training data to learn an interlingual representation, making them sensitive to the domain of the training data. In this paper, we learn an interlingual representation in an unsupervised manner using only a bilingual dictionary. We first use the bilingual dictionary to find candidate document alignments and then use them to find an interlingual representation. Since the candidate alignments are noisy, we de- velop a robust learning algorithm to learn the interlingual representation. We show that bilingual dictionaries generalize to different domains better: our approach gives better performance than either a word by word translation method or Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) trained on a different domain.</p><p>3 0.072297037 <a title="80-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Peeling_Back_the_Layers%3A_Detecting_Event_Role_Fillers_in_Secondary_Contexts.html">244 acl-2011-Peeling Back the Layers: Detecting Event Role Fillers in Secondary Contexts</a></p>
<p>Author: Ruihong Huang ; Ellen Riloff</p><p>Abstract: The goal of our research is to improve event extraction by learning to identify secondary role filler contexts in the absence of event keywords. We propose a multilayered event extraction architecture that progressively “zooms in” on relevant information. Our extraction model includes a document genre classifier to recognize event narratives, two types of sentence classifiers, and noun phrase classifiers to extract role fillers. These modules are organized as a pipeline to gradually zero in on event-related information. We present results on the MUC-4 event extraction data set and show that this model performs better than previous systems.</p><p>4 0.065297998 <a title="80-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Towards_a_Framework_for_Abstractive_Summarization_of_Multimodal_Documents.html">308 acl-2011-Towards a Framework for Abstractive Summarization of Multimodal Documents</a></p>

<p>Author: Risa Kitajima ; Ichiro Kobayashi</p><p>Abstract: Recently, several latent topic analysis methods such as LSI, pLSI, and LDA have been widely used for text analysis. However, those methods basically assign topics to words, but do not account for the events in a document. With this background, in this paper, we propose a latent topic extracting method which assigns topics to events. We also show that our proposed method is useful to generate a document summary based on a latent topic.</p><p>6 0.064763807 <a title="80-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Rare_Word_Translation_Extraction_from_Aligned_Comparable_Documents.html">259 acl-2011-Rare Word Translation Extraction from Aligned Comparable Documents</a></p>

<p>Author: Gregory Brown</p><p>Abstract: Relation extraction in documents allows the detection of how entities being discussed in a document are related to one another (e.g. partof). This paper presents an analysis of a relation extraction system based on prior work but applied to the J.D. Power and Associates Sentiment Corpus to examine how the system works on documents from a range of social media. The results are examined on three different subsets of the JDPA Corpus, showing that the system performs much worse on documents from certain sources. The proposed explanation is that the features used are more appropriate to text with strong editorial standards than the informal writing style of blogs.</p><p>3 0.72056597 <a title="80-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-Towards_a_Framework_for_Abstractive_Summarization_of_Multimodal_Documents.html">308 acl-2011-Towards a Framework for Abstractive Summarization of Multimodal Documents</a></p>

<p>Author: Hugo Jair Escalante ; Thamar Solorio ; Manuel Montes-y-Gomez</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes the use of local histograms (LH) over character n-grams for authorship attribution (AA). LHs are enriched histogram representations that preserve sequential information in documents; they have been successfully used for text categorization and document visualization using word histograms. In this work we explore the suitability of LHs over n-grams at the character-level for AA. We show that LHs are particularly helpful for AA, because they provide useful information for uncovering, to some extent, the writing style of authors. We report experimental results in AA data sets that confirm that LHs over character n-grams are more helpful for AA than the usual global histograms, yielding results far superior to state of the art approaches. We found that LHs are even more advantageous in challenging conditions, such as having imbalanced and small training sets. Our results motivate further research on the use of LHs for modeling the writing style of authors for related tasks, such as authorship verification and plagiarism detection.</p><p>5 0.69903684 <a title="80-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-An_Interface_for_Rapid_Natural_Language_Processing_Development_in_UIMA.html">42 acl-2011-An Interface for Rapid Natural Language Processing Development in UIMA</a></p>
<p>Author: Balaji Soundrarajan ; Thomas Ginter ; Scott DuVall</p><p>Abstract: This demonstration presents the Annotation Librarian, an application programming interface that supports rapid development of natural language processing (NLP) projects built in Apache Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA). The flexibility of UIMA to support all types of unstructured data – images, audio, and text – increases the complexity of some of the most common NLP development tasks. The Annotation Librarian interface handles these common functions and allows the creation and management of annotations by mirroring Java methods used to manipulate Strings. The familiar syntax and NLP-centric design allows developers to adopt and rapidly develop NLP algorithms in UIMA. The general functionality of the interface is described in relation to the use cases that necessitated its creation. 1</p><p>6 0.66636169 <a title="80-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Comparative_News_Summarization_Using_Linear_Programming.html">76 acl-2011-Comparative News Summarization Using Linear Programming</a></p>

<p>Author: Nan Duan ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents hypothesis mixture decoding (HM decoding), a new decoding scheme that performs translation reconstruction using hypotheses generated by multiple translation systems. HM decoding involves two decoding stages: first, each component system decodes independently, with the explored search space kept for use in the next step; second, a new search space is constructed by composing existing hypotheses produced by all component systems using a set of rules provided by the HM decoder itself, and a new set of model independent features are used to seek the final best translation from this new search space. Few assumptions are made by our approach about the underlying component systems, enabling us to leverage SMT models based on arbitrary paradigms. We compare our approach with several related techniques, and demonstrate significant BLEU improvements in large-scale Chinese-to-English translation tasks.</p><p>4 0.41307896 <a title="80-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-An_Affect-Enriched_Dialogue_Act_Classification_Model_for_Task-Oriented_Dialogue.html">33 acl-2011-An Affect-Enriched Dialogue Act Classification Model for Task-Oriented Dialogue</a></p>
<p>Author: Kristy Boyer ; Joseph Grafsgaard ; Eun Young Ha ; Robert Phillips ; James Lester</p><p>Abstract: Dialogue act classification is a central challenge for dialogue systems. Although the importance of emotion in human dialogue is widely recognized, most dialogue act classification models make limited or no use of affective channels in dialogue act classification. This paper presents a novel affect-enriched dialogue act classifier for task-oriented dialogue that models facial expressions of users, in particular, facial expressions related to confusion. The findings indicate that the affectenriched classifiers perform significantly better for distinguishing user requests for feedback and grounding dialogue acts within textual dialogue. The results point to ways in which dialogue systems can effectively leverage affective channels to improve dialogue act classification. 1</p><p>5 0.410238 <a title="80-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Prototyping_virtual_instructors_from_human-human_corpora.html">252 acl-2011-Prototyping virtual instructors from human-human corpora</a></p>
<p>Author: Luciana Benotti ; Alexandre Denis</p><p>Abstract: Virtual instructors can be used in several applications, ranging from trainers in simulated worlds to non player characters for virtual games. In this paper we present a novel algorithm for rapidly prototyping virtual instructors from human-human corpora without manual annotation. Automatically prototyping full-fledged dialogue systems from corpora is far from being a reality nowadays. Our algorithm is restricted in that only the virtual instructor can perform speech acts while the user responses are limited to physical actions in the virtual world. We evaluate a virtual instructor, generated using this algorithm, with human users. We compare our results both with human instructors and rule-based virtual instructors hand-coded for the same task.</p><p>6 0.40991563 <a title="80-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Turn-Taking_Cues_in_a_Human_Tutoring_Corpus.html">312 acl-2011-Turn-Taking Cues in a Human Tutoring Corpus</a></p>

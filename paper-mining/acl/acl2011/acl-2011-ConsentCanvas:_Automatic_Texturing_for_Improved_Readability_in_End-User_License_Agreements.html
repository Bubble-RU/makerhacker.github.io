[sent-4, score-0.065]
</p><p>2 The system aims to help users better understand the terms under which they are providing their informed consent. [sent-5, score-0.028]
</p><p>3 ConsentCanvas receives unstructured text documents as input and uses unsupervised natural language processing methods to embellish the source document using a linked stylesheet. [sent-6, score-0.267]
</p><p>4 Unlike similar usable security projects which employ summarization techniques, our system preserves the contents of the source document, minimizing the cognitive and legal burden for both the end user and the licensor. [sent-7, score-0.508]
</p><p>5 1  Introduction  Less than 2% of users read End-User License Agreement (EULA) documents when indicating their consent to the software installation process (Good et al. [sent-9, score-0.239]
</p><p>6 While these documents often serve as a user’s sole direct interaction with the legal terms of the software, they are usually not read, as they are presented in such a way as is divorced from the use of the software itself (Friedman et al. [sent-11, score-0.242]
</p><p>7 To address this, Kay and Terry (2010) developed what they call Textured Consent agreements which employ a linked stylesheet to augment salient parts of a EULA document. [sent-13, score-0.195]
</p><p>8 We have developed a system, ConsentCanvas, for automating the creation of a Textured Consent  document from an unstructured EULA based on the example XHTML/CSS template provided by Kay and Terry (2010; Figure 1). [sent-15, score-0.165]
</p><p>9 Instead, it makes use of regular expressions and correlation functions to identify variable-length relevant phrases (Kim and Chan, 2004) to alter the document’s structure and appearance. [sent-17, score-0.313]
</p><p>10 The system automates the labour intensive manual process used by Kay and Terry (2010). [sent-19, score-0.029]
</p><p>11 We also present the first available implementation of Kim and Chan’s algorithm (2004). [sent-21, score-0.04]
</p><p>12 As such, we contribute not just a working application, but also an extensible framework for the visual embellishment of plaintext documents. [sent-34, score-0.053]
</p><p>13 1 Analysis Our system takes plain-text EULA documents as input through a simple command line interface. [sent-36, score-0.065]
</p><p>14 It then passes this document to four independent submodules for analysis. [sent-37, score-0.129]
</p><p>15 Each submodule stores the initial and final character positions of a string selected from within the document body, but does not modify the document before reaching the renderer step. [sent-38, score-0.354]
</p><p>16 2 Variable-Length Phrase Finder The variable-length phrase finder module features a Python implementation of the Variable-Length Phrase Finding (VLPF) Algorithm by Kim and Chan (2004). [sent-40, score-0.283]
</p><p>17 Kim and Chan’s algorithm was chosen for its domain independence and adaptability, as it can be fine-tuned to use different correlation functions. [sent-41, score-0.098]
</p><p>18 42 This algorithm computes the conditional probability for the relative importance of variable-length ngram phrases from the source document alone. [sent-44, score-0.229]
</p><p>19 It begins by considering every word a phrase with a length of one. [sent-45, score-0.043]
</p><p>20 That is, every phrase of length m P{m} is  considered as P{m-1 }w, where w is a following adjacent word. [sent-47, score-0.043]
</p><p>21 Correlation is calculated between the leading phrase P{m-1 } and the trailing word w. [sent-48, score-0.091]
</p><p>22 Phrases that maintain a high level of correlation are creating by appending the trailing word w, and those with a correlation score below a certain threshold are pruned before the next iteration. [sent-49, score-0.244]
</p><p>23 This continues until no more phrases can be created. [sent-50, score-0.1]
</p><p>24 The VLPF algorithm is able to use any of several existing correlation functions. [sent-52, score-0.098]
</p><p>25 We have implemented the Piatetsky-Shapiro correlation function, the simplest of the three best-performing functions used by Kim and Chan, which achieved a correlation of 92. [sent-53, score-0.196]
</p><p>26 We removed English stopwords, but did not perform any stemming when selecting relevant phrases because the selection of VLPs did not depend on global term co-occurrence, and we did not want to modify selected exact phrases. [sent-55, score-0.135]
</p><p>27 We emphasize the top 15% meaningful phrases (as deter-  mined by the algorithm) for the entire document. [sent-56, score-0.144]
</p><p>28 15% was chosen for its comparable results to Kay and Terry’s example document (2010). [sent-57, score-0.129]
</p><p>29 The phrase selected as the most relevant is also reproduced in the pull quote at the top of the document, as shown in Figure 3. [sent-58, score-0.252]
</p><p>30 3  Contact Information Extractor  The contact information extractor module uses regular expressions to match URLs, email addresses, or phone numbers within the document text. [sent-60, score-0.522]
</p><p>31 4 Segmenter The segmenter module uses Hearst’s TextTiling algorithm to “segment text into multi-paragraph subtopic passages” (1997). [sent-63, score-0.234]
</p><p>32 ConsentCanvas uses the NLTK implementation of the TextTiling algorithm. [sent-65, score-0.04]
</p><p>33 Segmentation was not applied to the entire document (doing this resulted in a messy layout incoherent with structuring applied by headers and titles). [sent-66, score-0.204]
</p><p>34 Instead, we used it to identify the lead paragraph of the document, which  was rendered differently using the “lead paragraph” container in the template. [sent-67, score-0.067]
</p><p>35 Future versions will use a more modern segmenting algorithm. [sent-68, score-0.03]
</p><p>36 5  Header Extractor  The header extractor module uses regular expressions to match any section header-like text from the original document. [sent-70, score-0.498]
</p><p>37 Several different search strings were used to catch multiple potential header types, including but not limited to: • • • •  8 OR FEWER 3. [sent-71, score-0.201]
</p><p>38 1Multi-level Eight or fewer  ALL-CAPS TOKENS numbered headers numbered headers tokens separated by a line break  Figure 3. [sent-73, score-0.238]
</p><p>39 6 Rendering Each analysis submodule produces a list of character positions where found items begin and end. [sent-76, score-0.096]
</p><p>40 These are passed to our rendering system, which inserts the corresponding HTML5 tags at the positions in original plaintext EULA. [sent-77, score-0.154]
</p><p>41 We append a header to the output document to include the linked stylesheet per HTML5 specifications. [sent-78, score-0.433]
</p><p>42 3  Analysis & Results  We conducted a brief qualitative analysis on ConsentCanvas after implementation and debugging. [sent-79, score-0.067]
</p><p>43 However, the problem space and system are not yet ready for formal verification or experimentation. [sent-80, score-0.032]
</p><p>44 More exploration and refinement are required before we will be able to empirically determine if we have improved readability and comprehension. [sent-81, score-0.077]
</p><p>45 1 Corpus We conducted our analysis on a small sample of EULAs from the same collection used by Lavesson et al. [sent-83, score-0.027]
</p><p>46 In several of the best examples of texturized EULAs security concerns were highlighted; in the texturized version of one document, the pull quote was “on media, ICONIX, Inc. [sent-89, score-0.409]
</p><p>47 warrants that such media is free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of purchase as evidenced by a copy of the receipt. [sent-90, score-0.093]
</p><p>48 is free to use any ideas, concepts,” “(except one copy for backup purposes),” and “Inc. [sent-94, score-0.066]
</p><p>49 ” Some phrases have incomplete words at the beginning and end; this is an artifact of a known but unfixed bug in the implementation, not a result of the algorithm. [sent-97, score-0.1]
</p><p>50 Several short but frequent phrases were found to be VLPs, such as “Inc. [sent-99, score-0.1]
</p><p>51 In short licenses consisting of only one to three paragraphs, sometimes no relevant VLPs were discovered. [sent-101, score-0.064]
</p><p>52 There are also many phrases that should be highlighted that are not. [sent-102, score-0.132]
</p><p>53 3 Preliminary System Evaluation We conducted an informal evaluation in which our system applied texture to 15 documents chosen from our corpus at random. [sent-104, score-0.192]
</p><p>54 The pull quote text was nearly unintelligible in almost all cases, due largely to the fact that it did not split evenly on sentence borders. [sent-108, score-0.203]
</p><p>55 We did not let this detract from our evaluation of the documents, because performance in this area was so consistently, and charmingly, poor, but did not affect readability of the main document body. [sent-109, score-0.235]
</p><p>56 1 Comparisons with Kay and Terry Kay and Terry (2010) make reference to “augmenting and embellishing” the document text specifically not altering the original content. [sent-112, score-0.129]
</p><p>57 However, their example document is written concisely in a user-friendly voice dissimilar to most formal EULAs found in the wild. [sent-113, score-0.161]
</p><p>58 2 Handling Legal Language We had anticipated a considerable amount of difficult-to-understand legal language in the source document. [sent-116, score-0.148]
</p><p>59 However, most documents were found to contain a number of high-frequency VLPs with both layperson-salient legal terminology and common clues to document structure. [sent-117, score-0.342]
</p><p>60 The variable-length  phrase finding module only incorporates a single correlation function. [sent-120, score-0.261]
</p><p>61 Machine learning techniques might also be used to classify phrases as relevant or not, leading to better-emphasized content. [sent-122, score-0.135]
</p><p>62 In the example license designed by Kay and Terry (2010), there are one or two emphasized phrases in each section. [sent-124, score-0.263]
</p><p>63 The phrases found by ConsentCanvas are often sporadic, clustering in some sections and absent from others. [sent-125, score-0.1]
</p><p>64 As a result of this, readability suffers, and so we may need to look into possible stratification of VLPs. [sent-126, score-0.077]
</p><p>65 This might also aid multi-lingual documents, of which there are a few examples (a cursory look showed the results in French were comparable to those in culty in selecting meaningful phrases from diffi-  English in a bilingual EULA in our corpus). [sent-127, score-0.173]
</p><p>66 44  Contact information is currently emphasized in the same manner as salient phrases. [sent-128, score-0.085]
</p><p>67 We plan to eventually embed hyperlinks for all URLs and email addresses found in the source document, as in Kay and Terry (2010). [sent-129, score-0.038]
</p><p>68 The segmenter module uses the basic TextTiling algorithm with default parameters. [sent-130, score-0.186]
</p><p>69 We plan to improve header extractor providing more sophisticated regular expressions; we found that a wide variety of header styles were used. [sent-133, score-0.539]
</p><p>70 In particular, we plan to consider layouts that use digits, punctuation, or inconsistent capitalization in  multiple instances in the document body. [sent-134, score-0.158]
</p><p>71 There is currently no module that incorporates the “Warning” box from Kay and Terry (2010). [sent-135, score-0.12]
</p><p>72 This module would be designed to select relevant multiline blocks of text by using techniques similar to the variable-length phrase finder or the segmenter. [sent-136, score-0.278]
</p><p>73 This will enable customized texturing of EULAs and facilitate experimentation for understanding and evaluating gains in comprehension and readability. [sent-138, score-0.066]
</p><p>74 Finally, we will conduct a formal user evaluation of ConsentCanvas. [sent-139, score-0.078]
</p><p>75 5  Conclusion  We have provided a description of the work in progress for ConsentCanvas, a system for automatically adding texture to EULAs to improve readability and comprehension. [sent-140, score-0.143]

<p>Author: Nitin Agarwal ; Ravi Shankar Reddy ; Kiran GVR ; Carolyn Penstein Rose</p><p>Abstract: In this demo, we present SciSumm, an interactive multi-document summarization system for scientific articles. The document collection to be summarized is a list of papers cited together within the same source article, otherwise known as a co-citation. At the heart of the approach is a topic based clustering of fragments extracted from each article based on queries generated from the context surrounding the co-cited list of papers. This analysis enables the generation of an overview of common themes from the co-cited papers that relate to the context in which the co-citation was found. SciSumm is currently built over the 2008 ACL Anthology, however the gen- eralizable nature of the summarization techniques and the extensible architecture makes it possible to use the system with other corpora where a citation network is available. Evaluation results on the same corpus demonstrate that our system performs better than an existing widely used multi-document summarization system (MEAD).</p><p>3 0.051258095 <a title="80-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Probabilistic_Document_Modeling_for_Syntax_Removal_in_Text_Summarization.html">251 acl-2011-Probabilistic Document Modeling for Syntax Removal in Text Summarization</a></p>
<p>Author: William M. Darling ; Fei Song</p><p>Abstract: Statistical approaches to automatic text summarization based on term frequency continue to perform on par with more complex summarization methods. To compute useful frequency statistics, however, the semantically important words must be separated from the low-content function words. The standard approach of using an a priori stopword list tends to result in both undercoverage, where syntactical words are seen as semantically relevant, and overcoverage, where words related to content are ignored. We present a generative probabilistic modeling approach to building content distributions for use with statistical multi-document summarization where the syntax words are learned directly from the data with a Hidden Markov Model and are thereby deemphasized in the term frequency statistics. This approach is compared to both a stopword-list and POS-tagging approach and our method demonstrates improved coverage on the DUC 2006 and TAC 2010 datasets using the ROUGE metric.</p><p>4 0.05064436 <a title="80-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-From_Bilingual_Dictionaries_to_Interlingual_Document_Representations.html">139 acl-2011-From Bilingual Dictionaries to Interlingual Document Representations</a></p>
<p>Author: Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi ; Hal Daume III ; Raghavendra Udupa</p><p>Abstract: Mapping documents into an interlingual representation can help bridge the language barrier of a cross-lingual corpus. Previous approaches use aligned documents as training data to learn an interlingual representation, making them sensitive to the domain of the training data. In this paper, we learn an interlingual representation in an unsupervised manner using only a bilingual dictionary. We first use the bilingual dictionary to find candidate document alignments and then use them to find an interlingual representation. Since the candidate alignments are noisy, we de- velop a robust learning algorithm to learn the interlingual representation. We show that bilingual dictionaries generalize to different domains better: our approach gives better performance than either a word by word translation method or Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) trained on a different domain.</p><p>5 0.05043589 <a title="80-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Towards_a_Framework_for_Abstractive_Summarization_of_Multimodal_Documents.html">308 acl-2011-Towards a Framework for Abstractive Summarization of Multimodal Documents</a></p>

We discuss the type of model required, the means by which it can be constructed, how the content of the model is rated and selected, and the method of realizing novel sentences for the summary. To this end, we introduce a metric called information density used for gauging the importance of content obtained from text and graphical sources.</p><p>6 0.049174439 <a title="80-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-A_Latent_Topic_Extracting_Method_based_on_Events_in_a_Document_and_its_Application.html">18 acl-2011-A Latent Topic Extracting Method based on Events in a Document and its Application</a></p>

<p>Author: Oliver Schneider ; Alex Garnett</p><p>Abstract: We present ConsentCanvas, a system which structures and “texturizes” End-User License Agreement (EULA) documents to be more readable. The system aims to help users better understand the terms under which they are providing their informed consent. ConsentCanvas receives unstructured text documents as input and uses unsupervised natural language processing methods to embellish the source document using a linked stylesheet. Unlike similar usable security projects which employ summarization techniques, our system preserves the contents of the source document, minimizing the cognitive and legal burden for both the end user and the licensor. Our system does not require a corpus for training. 1</p><p>2 0.65113348 <a title="80-lsi-2" href="./acl-2011-Towards_a_Framework_for_Abstractive_Summarization_of_Multimodal_Documents.html">308 acl-2011-Towards a Framework for Abstractive Summarization of Multimodal Documents</a></p>
<p>Author: Charles Greenbacker</p><p>Abstract: We propose a framework for generating an abstractive summary from a semantic model of a multimodal document. We discuss the type of model required, the means by which it can be constructed, how the content of the model is rated and selected, and the method of realizing novel sentences for the summary. To this end, we introduce a metric called information density used for gauging the importance of content obtained from text and graphical sources.</p><p>3 0.6416871 <a title="80-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-Predicting_Clicks_in_a_Vocabulary_Learning_System.html">248 acl-2011-Predicting Clicks in a Vocabulary Learning System</a></p>
<p>Author: Aaron Michelony</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of predicting which words a student will click in a vocabulary learning system. Often a language learner will find value in the ability to look up the meaning of an unknown word while reading an electronic document by clicking the word. Highlighting words likely to be unknown to a readeris attractive due to drawing his orher attention to it and indicating that information is available. However, this option is usually done manually in vocabulary systems and online encyclopedias such as Wikipedia. Furthurmore, it is never on a per-user basis. This paper presents an automated way of highlighting words likely to be unknown to the specific user. We present related work in search engine ranking, a description of the study used to collect click data, the experiment we performed using the random forest machine learning algorithm and finish with a discussion of future work.</p><p>4 0.62756091 <a title="80-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Exploiting_Readymades_in_Linguistic_Creativity%3A_A_System_Demonstration_of_the_Jigsaw_Bard.html">125 acl-2011-Exploiting Readymades in Linguistic Creativity: A System Demonstration of the Jigsaw Bard</a></p>
<p>Author: Tony Veale ; Yanfen Hao</p><p>Abstract: Large lexical resources, such as corpora and databases of Web ngrams, are a rich source of pre-fabricated phrases that can be reused in many different contexts. However, one must be careful in how these resources are used, and noted writers such as George Orwell have argued that the use of canned phrases encourages sloppy thinking and results in poor communication. Nonetheless, while Orwell prized home-made phrases over the readymade variety, there is a vibrant movement in modern art which shifts artistic creation from the production of novel artifacts to the clever reuse of readymades or objets trouvés. We describe here a system that makes creative reuse of the linguistic readymades in the Google ngrams. Our system, the Jigsaw Bard, thus owes more to Marcel Duchamp than to George Orwell. We demonstrate how textual readymades can be identified and harvested on a large scale, and used to drive a modest form of linguistic creativity. 1</p><p>5 0.61353886 <a title="80-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Lexically-Triggered_Hidden_Markov_Models_for_Clinical_Document_Coding.html">209 acl-2011-Lexically-Triggered Hidden Markov Models for Clinical Document Coding</a></p>
<p>Author: Svetlana Kiritchenko ; Colin Cherry</p><p>Abstract: The automatic coding of clinical documents is an important task for today’s healthcare providers. Though it can be viewed as multi-label document classification, the coding problem has the interesting property that most code assignments can be supported by a single phrase found in the input document. We propose a Lexically-Triggered Hidden Markov Model (LT-HMM) that leverages these phrases to improve coding accuracy. The LT-HMM works in two stages: first, a lexical match is performed against a term dictionary to collect a set of candidate codes for a document. Next, a discriminative HMM selects the best subset of codes to assign to the document by tagging candidates as present or absent. By confirming codes proposed by a dictionary, the LT-HMM can share features across codes, enabling strong performance even on rare codes. In fact, we are able to recover codes that do not occur in the training set at all. Our approach achieves the best ever performance on the 2007 Medical NLP Challenge test set, with an F-measure of 89.84.</p><p>6 0.60633165 <a title="80-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Towards_Style_Transformation_from_Written-Style_to_Audio-Style.html">306 acl-2011-Towards Style Transformation from Written-Style to Audio-Style</a></p>

<p>Author: Daniel Hewlett ; Paul Cohen</p><p>Abstract: Several results in the word segmentation literature suggest that description length provides a useful estimate of segmentation quality in fully unsupervised settings. However, since the space of potential segmentations grows exponentially with the length of the corpus, no tractable algorithm follows directly from the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. Therefore, it is necessary to generate a set of candidate segmentations and select between them according to the MDL principle. We evaluate several algorithms for generating these candidate segmentations on a range of natural language corpora, and show that the Bootstrapped Voting Experts algorithm consistently outperforms other methods when paired with MDL.</p><p>3 0.84820414 <a title="80-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-HITS-based_Seed_Selection_and_Stop_List_Construction_for_Bootstrapping.html">148 acl-2011-HITS-based Seed Selection and Stop List Construction for Bootstrapping</a></p>
<p>Author: Tetsuo Kiso ; Masashi Shimbo ; Mamoru Komachi ; Yuji Matsumoto</p><p>Abstract: In bootstrapping (seed set expansion), selecting good seeds and creating stop lists are two effective ways to reduce semantic drift, but these methods generally need human supervision. In this paper, we propose a graphbased approach to helping editors choose effective seeds and stop list instances, applicable to Pantel and Pennacchiotti’s Espresso bootstrapping algorithm. The idea is to select seeds and create a stop list using the rankings of instances and patterns computed by Kleinberg’s HITS algorithm. Experimental results on a variation of the lexical sample task show the effectiveness of our method.</p><p>4 0.81431293 <a title="80-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Confidence_Driven_Unsupervised_Semantic_Parsing.html">79 acl-2011-Confidence Driven Unsupervised Semantic Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Dan Goldwasser ; Roi Reichart ; James Clarke ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Current approaches for semantic parsing take a supervised approach requiring a considerable amount of training data which is expensive and difficult to obtain. This supervision bottleneck is one of the major difficulties in scaling up semantic parsing. We argue that a semantic parser can be trained effectively without annotated data, and introduce an unsupervised learning algorithm. The algorithm takes a self training approach driven by confidence estimation. Evaluated over Geoquery, a standard dataset for this task, our system achieved 66% accuracy, compared to 80% of its fully supervised counterpart, demonstrating the promise of unsupervised approaches for this task.</p><p>5 0.75826991 <a title="80-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Two_Easy_Improvements_to_Lexical_Weighting.html">313 acl-2011-Two Easy Improvements to Lexical Weighting</a></p>
<p>Author: David Chiang ; Steve DeNeefe ; Michael Pust</p><p>Abstract: We introduce two simple improvements to the lexical weighting features of Koehn, Och, and Marcu (2003) for machine translation: one which smooths the probability of translating word f to word e by simplifying English morphology, and one which conditions it on the kind of training data that f and e co-occurred in. These new variations lead to improvements of up to +0.8 BLEU, with an average improvement of +0.6 BLEU across two language pairs, two genres, and two translation systems.</p><p>6 0.64912349 <a title="80-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-EdIt%3A_A_Broad-Coverage_Grammar_Checker_Using_Pattern_Grammar.html">108 acl-2011-EdIt: A Broad-Coverage Grammar Checker Using Pattern Grammar</a></p>

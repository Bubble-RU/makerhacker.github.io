<p>Author: Omar F. Zaidan ; Chris Callison-Burch</p><p>Abstract: Naively collecting translations by crowdsourcing the task to non-professional translators yields disfluent, low-quality results if no quality control is exercised. We demonstrate a variety of mechanisms that increase the translation quality to near professional levels. Specifically, we solicit redundant translations and edits to them, and automatically select the best output among them. We propose a set of features that model both the translations and the translators, such as country of residence, LM perplexity of the translation, edit rate from the other translations, and (optionally) calibration against professional translators. Using these features to score the collected translations, we are able to discriminate between acceptable and unacceptable translations. We recreate the NIST 2009 Urdu-toEnglish evaluation set with Mechanical Turk, and quantitatively show that our models are able to select translations within the range of quality that we expect from professional trans- lators. The total cost is more than an order of magnitude lower than professional translation.</p><p>3 0.18285282 <a title="313-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Consistent_Translation_using_Discriminative_Learning_-_A_Translation_Memory-inspired_Approach.html">81 acl-2011-Consistent Translation using Discriminative Learning - A Translation Memory-inspired Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Yanjun Ma ; Yifan He ; Andy Way ; Josef van Genabith</p><p>Abstract: We present a discriminative learning method to improve the consistency of translations in phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems. Our method is inspired by Translation Memory (TM) systems which are widely used by human translators in industrial settings. We constrain the translation of an input sentence using the most similar ‘translation example’ retrieved from the TM. Differently from previous research which used simple fuzzy match thresholds, these constraints are imposed using discriminative learning to optimise the translation performance. We observe that using this method can benefit the SMT system by not only producing consistent translations, but also improved translation outputs. We report a 0.9 point improvement in terms of BLEU score on English–Chinese technical documents.</p><p>4 0.17945795 <a title="313-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Rare_Word_Translation_Extraction_from_Aligned_Comparable_Documents.html">259 acl-2011-Rare Word Translation Extraction from Aligned Comparable Documents</a></p>
<p>Author: Emmanuel Prochasson ; Pascale Fung</p><p>Abstract: We present a first known result of high precision rare word bilingual extraction from comparable corpora, using aligned comparable documents and supervised classification. We incorporate two features, a context-vector similarity and a co-occurrence model between words in aligned documents in a machine learning approach. We test our hypothesis on different pairs of languages and corpora. We obtain very high F-Measure between 80% and 98% for recognizing and extracting correct translations for rare terms (from 1to 5 occurrences). Moreover, we show that our system can be trained on a pair of languages and test on a different pair of languages, obtaining a F-Measure of 77% for the classification of Chinese-English translations using a training corpus of Spanish-French. Our method is therefore even potentially applicable to low resources languages without training data.</p><p>5 0.17883025 <a title="313-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Combining_Morpheme-based_Machine_Translation_with_Post-processing_Morpheme_Prediction.html">75 acl-2011-Combining Morpheme-based Machine Translation with Post-processing Morpheme Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Ann Clifton ; Anoop Sarkar</p><p>Abstract: This paper extends the training and tuning regime for phrase-based statistical machine translation to obtain fluent translations into morphologically complex languages (we build an English to Finnish translation system) . Our methods use unsupervised morphology induction. Unlike previous work we focus on morphologically productive phrase pairs – our decoder can combine morphemes across phrase boundaries. Morphemes in the target language may not have a corresponding morpheme or word in the source language. Therefore, we propose a novel combination of post-processing morphology prediction with morpheme-based translation. We show, using both automatic evaluation scores and linguistically motivated analyses of the output, that our methods outperform previously proposed ones and pro- vide the best known results on the EnglishFinnish Europarl translation task. Our methods are mostly language independent, so they should improve translation into other target languages with complex morphology. 1 Translation and Morphology Languages with rich morphological systems present significant hurdles for statistical machine translation (SMT) , most notably data sparsity, source-target asymmetry, and problems with automatic evaluation. In this work, we propose to address the problem of morphological complexity in an Englishto-Finnish MT task within a phrase-based translation framework. We focus on unsupervised segmentation methods to derive the morphological information supplied to the MT model in order to provide coverage on very large datasets and for languages with few hand-annotated 32 resources. In fact, in our experiments, unsupervised morphology always outperforms the use of a hand-built morphological analyzer. Rather than focusing on a few linguistically motivated aspects of Finnish morphological behaviour, we develop techniques for handling morphological complexity in general. We chose Finnish as our target language for this work, because it exemplifies many of the problems morphologically complex languages present for SMT. Among all the languages in the Europarl data-set, Finnish is the most difficult language to translate from and into, as was demonstrated in the MT Summit shared task (Koehn, 2005) . Another reason is the current lack of knowledge about how to apply SMT successfully to agglutinative languages like Turkish or Finnish. Our main contributions are: 1) the introduction of the notion of segmented translation where we explicitly allow phrase pairs that can end with a dangling morpheme, which can connect with other morphemes as part of the translation process, and 2) the use of a fully segmented translation model in combination with a post-processing morpheme prediction system, using unsupervised morphology induction. Both of these approaches beat the state of the art on the English-Finnish translation task. Morphology can express both content and function categories, and our experiments show that it is important to use morphology both within the translation model (for morphology with content) and outside it (for morphology contributing to fluency) . Automatic evaluation measures for MT, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), WER (Word Error Rate) and PER (Position Independent Word Error Rate) use the word as the basic unit rather than morphemes. In a word comProce dPinogrstla ofn tdh,e O 4r9etghon A,n Jnu nael 1 M9-e 2t4i,n2g 0 o1f1 t.he ?c A2s0s1o1ci Aatsiosonc fioartio Cno fmorpu Ctoamtiopnuatalt Lioin gauli Lsitnicgsu,i psatgices 32–42, prised of multiple morphemes, getting even a single morpheme wrong means the entire word is wrong. In addition to standard MT evaluation measures, we perform a detailed linguistic analysis of the output. Our proposed approaches are significantly better than the state of the art, achieving the highest reported BLEU scores on the English-Finnish Europarl version 3 data-set. Our linguistic analysis shows that our models have fewer morpho-syntactic errors compared to the word-based baseline. 2 2.1 Models Baseline Models We set up three baseline models for comparison in this work. The first is a basic wordbased model (called Baseline in the results) ; we trained this on the original unsegmented version of the text. Our second baseline is a factored translation model (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) (called Factored) , which used as factors the word, “stem” 1 and suffix. These are derived from the same unsupervised segmentation model used in other experiments. The results (Table 3) show that a factored model was unable to match the scores of a simple wordbased baseline. We hypothesize that this may be an inherently difficult representational form for a language with the degree of morphological complexity found in Finnish. Because the morphology generation must be precomputed, for languages with a high degree of morphological complexity, the combinatorial explosion makes it unmanageable to capture the full range of morphological productivity. In addition, because the morphological variants are generated on a per-word basis within a given phrase, it excludes productive morphological combination across phrase boundaries and makes it impossible for the model to take into account any longdistance dependencies between morphemes. We conclude from this result that it may be more useful for an agglutinative language to use morphology beyond the confines of the phrasal unit, and condition its generation on more than just the local target stem. In order to compare the 1see Section 2.2. 33 performance of unsupervised segmentation for translation, our third baseline is a segmented translation model based on a supervised segmentation model (called Sup) , using the hand-built Omorfi morphological analyzer (Pirinen and Listenmaa, 2007) , which provided slightly higher BLEU scores than the word-based baseline. 2.2 Segmented Translation For segmented translation models, it cannot be taken for granted that greater linguistic accuracy in segmentation yields improved translation (Chang et al. , 2008) . Rather, the goal in segmentation for translation is instead to maximize the amount of lexical content-carrying morphology, while generalizing over the information not helpful for improving the translation model. We therefore trained several different segmentation models, considering factors of granularity, coverage, and source-target symmetry. We performed unsupervised segmentation of the target data, using Morfessor (Creutz and Lagus, 2005) and Paramor (Monson, 2008) , two top systems from the Morpho Challenge 2008 (their combined output was the Morpho Challenge winner) . However, translation models based upon either Paramor alone or the combined systems output could not match the wordbased baseline, so we concentrated on Morfessor. Morfessor uses minimum description length criteria to train a HMM-based segmentation model. When tested against a human-annotated gold standard of linguistic morpheme segmentations for Finnish, this algorithm outperforms competing unsupervised methods, achieving an F-score of 67.0% on a 3 million sentence corpus (Creutz and Lagus, 2006) . Varying the perplexity threshold in Morfessor does not segment more word types, but rather over-segments the same word types. In order to get robust, common segmentations, we trained the segmenter on the 5000 most frequent words2 ; we then used this to segment the entire data set. In order to improve coverage, we then further segmented 2For the factored model baseline we also used the same setting perplexity = 30, 5,000 most frequent words, but with all but the last suffix collapsed and called the “stem” . TabHMleoat1nr:gplhiMngor phermphocTur631ae04in, 81c9ie03ns67gi,64n0S14e567theTp 2rsa51t, 29Se 3t168able and in translation. any word type that contained a match from the most frequent suffix set, looking for the longest matching suffix character string. We call this method Unsup L-match. After the segmentation, word-internal morpheme boundary markers were inserted into the segmented text to be used to reconstruct the surface forms in the MT output. We then trained the Moses phrase-based system (Koehn et al., 2007) on the segmented and marked text. After decoding, it was a simple matter to join together all adjacent morphemes with word-internal boundary markers to reconstruct the surface forms. Figure 1(a) gives the full model overview for all the variants of the segmented translation model (supervised/unsupervised; with and without the Unsup L-match procedure) . Table 1shows how morphemes are being used in the MT system. Of the phrases that included segmentations (‘Morph’ in Table 1) , roughly a third were ‘productive’, i.e. had a hanging morpheme (with a form such as stem+) that could be joined to a suffix (‘Hanging Morph’ in Table 1) . However, in phrases used while decoding the development and test data, roughly a quarter of the phrases that generated the translated output included segmentations, but of these, only a small fraction (6%) had a hanging morpheme; and while there are many possible reasons to account for this we were unable to find a single convincing cause. 2.3 Morphology Generation Morphology generation as a post-processing step allows major vocabulary reduction in the translation model, and allows the use of morphologically targeted features for modeling inflection. A possible disadvantage of this approach is that in this model there is no opportunity to con34 sider the morphology in translation since it is removed prior to training the translation model. Morphology generation models can use a variety of bilingual and contextual information to capture dependencies between morphemes, often more long-distance than what is possible using n-gram language models over morphemes in the segmented model. Similar to previous work (Minkov et al. , 2007; Toutanova et al. , 2008) , we model morphology generation as a sequence learning problem. Un- like previous work, we use unsupervised morphology induction and use automatically generated suffix classes as tags. The first phase of our morphology prediction model is to train a MT system that produces morphologically simplified word forms in the target language. The output word forms are complex stems (a stem and some suffixes) but still missing some important suffix morphemes. In the second phase, the output of the MT decoder is then tagged with a sequence of abstract suffix tags. In particular, the output of the MT decoder is a sequence of complex stems denoted by x and the output is a sequence of suffix class tags denoted by y. We use a list of parts from (x,y) and map to a d-dimensional feature vector Φ(x, y) , with each dimension being a real number. We infer the best sequence of tags using: F(x) = argymaxp(y | x,w) where F(x) returns the highest scoring output y∗ . A conditional random field (CRF) (Lafferty et al. , 2001) defines the conditional probability as a linear score for each candidate y and a global normalization term: logp(y | x, w) = Φ(x, y) · w − log Z where Z = Py0∈ exp(Φ(x, y0) · w) . We use stochastiPc gradient descent (using crfsgd3) to train the weight vector w. So far, this is all off-the-shelf sequence learning. However, the output y∗ from the CRF decoder is still only a sequence of abstract suffix tags.

The abstract suffix tags are extracted from the unsupervised morpheme learning process, and are carefully designed to enable CRF training and decoding. We call this model CRFLM for short. Figure 1(b) shows the full pipeline and Figure 2 shows a worked example of all the steps involved. We use the morphologically segmented training data (obtained using the segmented corpus described in Section 2.24) and remove selected suffixes to create a morphologically simplified version of the training data. The MT model is trained on the morphologically simplified training data. The output from the MT system is then used as input to the CRF model. The CRF model was trained on a ∼210,000 Finnish sentences, consisting noefd d∼ o1n.5 a am ∼il2li1o0n,0 tokens; tishhe 2,000 cseens,te cnoncse Europarl t.e5s tm isl eito nco tnoskiesntesd; hoef 41,434 stem tokens. The labels in the output sequence y were obtained by selecting the most productive 150 stems, and then collapsing certain vowels into equivalence classes corresponding to Finnish vowel harmony patterns. Thus 4Note that unlike Section 2.2 we do not use Unsup L-match because when evaluating the CRF model on the suffix prediction task it obtained 95.61% without using Unsup L-match and 82.99% when using Unsup L-match. 35 variants -k¨ o and -ko become vowel-generic enclitic particle -kO, and variants -ss ¨a and -ssa become the vowel-generic inessive case marker -ssA, etc. This is the only language-specific component of our translation model. However, we expect this approach to work for other agglutinative languages as well. For fusional languages like Spanish, another mapping from suffix to abstract tags might be needed. These suffix transformations to their equivalence classes prevent morphophonemic variants of the same morpheme from competing against each other in the prediction model. This resulted in 44 possible label outputs per stem which was a reasonable sized tag-set for CRF training. The CRF was trained on monolingual features of the segmented text for suffix prediction, where t is the current token: Word Stem st−n, .., st, .., st+n(n = 4) Morph Prediction yt−2 , yt−1 , yt With this simple feature set, we were able to use features over longer distances, resulting in a total of 1,110,075 model features. After CRF based recovery of the suffix tag sequence, we use a bigram language model trained on a full segmented version on the training data to recover the original vowels. We used bigrams only, because the suffix vowel harmony alternation depends only upon the preceding phonemes in the word from which it was segmented. original training koskevaa mietint o¨ ¨a data: k ¨asitell ¨a ¨an segmentation: koske+ +va+ +a mietint ¨o+ + a¨ k a¨si+ +te+ +ll a¨+ + a¨+ +n (train bigram language model with mapping A = { a , a }) map n fi bniaglr asmuff liaxn gtou agbest mraocdte tag-set: koske+ +va+ +A mietint ¨o+ +A k ¨asi+ +te+ +ll ¨a+ + ¨a+ +n (train CRF model to predict the final suffix) peeling of final suffix: koske+ +va+ mietint ¨o+ k a¨si+ +te+ +ll a¨+ + a¨+ (train SMT model on this transformation of training data) (a) Training decoder output: koske+ +va+ mietint o¨+ k a¨si+ +te+ +ll a¨+ + a¨+ decoder output stitched up: koskeva+ mietint o¨+ k ¨asitell ¨a ¨a+ CRF model prediction: x = ‘koskeva+ mietint ¨o+ k ¨asitell ¨a ¨a+’, y = ‘+A +A +n’ koskeva+ +A mietint ¨o+ +A k ¨asitell a¨ ¨a+ +n unstitch morphemes: koske+ +va+ +A mietint ¨o+ +A k ¨asi+ +te+ +ll ¨a+ + ¨a+ +n language model disambiguation: koske+ +va+ +a mietint ¨o+ + a¨ k a¨si+ +te+ +ll a¨+ + a¨+ +n final stitching: koskevaa mietint o¨ ¨a k ¨asitell ¨a ¨an (the output is then compared to the reference translation) (b) Decoding Figure 2: Worked example of all steps in the post-processing morphology prediction model. 3 Experimental Results used the Europarl version 3 corpus (Koehn, 2005) English-Finnish training data set, as well as the standard development and test data sets.

In all the experiments conducted in this paper, we used the Moses5 phrase-based translation system (Koehn et al. , 2007) , 2008 version. We trained all of the Moses systems herein using the standard features: language model, reordering model, translation model, and word penalty; in addition to these, the factored experiments called for additional translation and generation features for the added factors as noted above. We used in all experiments the following settings: a hypothesis stack size 100, distortion limit 6, phrase translations limit 20, and maximum phrase length 20. For the language models, we used SRILM 5-gram language models (Stolcke, 2002) for all factors. For our word-based Baseline system, we trained a word-based model using the same Moses system with identical settings. For evaluation against segmented translation systems in segmented forms before word reconstruction, we also segmented the baseline system’s word-based output. All the BLEU scores reported are for lowercase evaluation. We did an initial evaluation of the segmented output translation for each system using the no5http://www.statmt.org/moses/ 36 TabSlBUeuna2gps:meulSipengLmta-e nioatedchMo12dme804-.lB8S714cL±oEr0eUs.6 9 S8up19Nre.358ofe498rUs9ntoihe supervised segmentation baseline model. m-BLEU indicates that the segmented output was evaluated against a segmented version of the reference (this measure does not have the same correlation with human judgement as BLEU) .

Table 2 shows the m-BLEU scores for various systems. We also show the m-BLEU score without unigrams, since over-segmentation could lead to artificially high m-BLEU scores. In fact, if we compare the relative improvement of our m-BLEU scores for the Unsup L-match system we see a relative improvement of 39.75% over the baseline. Luong et. al. (2010) report an m-BLEU score of 55.64% but obtain a relative improvement of 0.6% over their baseline m-BLEU score. We find that when using a good segmentation model, segmentation of the morphologically complex target language improves model performance over an unsegmented baseline (the confidence scores come from bootstrap resampling) .

We also show a better relative improvement over our baseline when compared to (Luong et al., 2010) : a relative improvement of 4.86% for Unsup L-match compared to our baseline word-based model, compared to their 1.65% improvement over their baseline word-based model.

While we wish to explore minimally supervised morphological MT models, and use as little language specific information as possible, we do want to use linguistic analysis on the output of our system to see how well the models capture essential morphological information in the target language. So, we ran the word-based baseline system, the segmented model (Unsup L-match) , and the prediction model (CRF-LM) outputs, along with the reference translation through the supervised morphological analyzer Omorfi (Pirinen and Listenmaa, 2007) . Using this analysis, we looked at a variety of linguistic constructions that might reveal patterns in morphological behavior. These were: (a) explicitly marked 37 noun forms, (b) noun-adjective case agreement, (c) subject-verb person/number agreement, (d) transitive object case marking, (e) postpositions, and (f) possession. In each of these categories, we looked for construction matches on a per-sentence level between the models’ output and the reference translation. Table 4 shows the models’ performance on the constructions we examined. In all of the categories, the CRF-LM model achieves the best precision score, as we explain below, while the Unsup L-match model most frequently gets the highest recall score. A general pattern in the most prevalent of these constructions is that the baseline tends to prefer the least marked form for noun cases (corresponding to the nominative) more than the reference or the CRF-LM model. The baseline leaves nouns in the (unmarked) nominative far more than the reference, while the CRF-LM model comes much closer, so it seems to fare better at explicitly marking forms, rather than defaulting to the more frequent unmarked form. Finnish adjectives must be marked with the same case as their head noun, while verbs must agree in person and number with their subject. We saw that in both these categories, the CRFLM model outperforms for precision, while the segmented model gets the best recall. In addition, Finnish generally marks direct objects of verbs with the accusative or the partitive case; we observed more accusative/partitive-marked nouns following verbs in the CRF-LM output than in the baseline, as illustrated by example (1) in Fig. 3. While neither translation picks the same verb as in the reference for the input ‘clarify,’ the CRFLM-output paraphrases it by using a grammatical construction of the transitive verb followed by a noun phrase inflected with the accusative case, correctly capturing the transitive construction. The baseline translation instead follows ‘give’ with a direct object in the nominative case. To help clarify the constructions in question, we have used Google Translate6 to provide back6 http://translate.google. com/ of occurrences per sentence, recall and F-score. also averaged The constructions over the various translations. are listed in descending P, R and F stand for precision, order of their frequency in the texts. The highlighted value in each column is the most accurate with respect to the reference value. translations of our MT output into English; to contextualize these back-translations, we have provided Google’s back-translation of the reference. The use of postpositions shows another difference between the models. Finnish postpositions require the preceding noun to be in the genitive or sometimes partitive case, which occurs correctly more frequently in the CRF-LM than the baseline. In example (2) in Fig. 3, all three translations correspond to the English text, ‘with the basque nationalists. ’ However, the CRF-LM output is more grammatical than the baseline, because not only do the adjective and noun agree for case, but the noun ‘baskien’ to which the postposition ‘kanssa’ belongs is marked with the correct genitive case. However, this well-formedness is not rewarded by BLEU, because ‘baskien’ does not match the reference. In addition, while Finnish may express possession using case marking alone, it has another construction for possession; this can disambiguate an otherwise ambiguous clause. This alternate construction uses a pronoun in the genitive case followed by a possessive-marked noun; we see that the CRF-LM model correctly marks this construction more frequently than the baseline. As example (3) in Fig. 3 shows, while neither model correctly translates ‘matkan’ (‘trip’) , the baseline’s output attributes the inessive ‘yhteydess’ (‘connection’) as belonging to ‘tulokset’ (‘results’) , and misses marking the possession linking it to ‘Commissioner Fischler’. Our manual evaluation shows that the CRF38 LM model is producing output translations that are more morphologically fluent than the wordbased baseline and the segmented translation Unsup L-match system, even though the word choices lead to a lower BLEU score overall when compared to Unsup L-match. 4 Related Work The work on morphology in MT can be grouped into three categories, factored models, segmented translation, and morphology generation. Factored models (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) factor the phrase translation probabilities over additional information annotated to each word, allowing for text to be represented on multiple levels of analysis. We discussed the drawbacks of factored models for our task in Section 2. 1. While (Koehn and Hoang, 2007; Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006; Avramidis and Koehn, 2008) obtain improvements using factored models for translation into English, German, Spanish, and Czech, these models may be less useful for capturing long-distance dependencies in languages with much more complex morphological systems such as Finnish. In our experiments factored models did worse than the baseline. Segmented translation performs morphological analysis on the morphologically complex text for use in the translation model (Brown et al. , 1993; Goldwater and McClosky, 2005; de Gispert and Mari n˜o, 2008) . This method unpacks complex forms into simpler, more frequently occurring components, and may also increase the symmetry of the lexically realized content be(1) Input: ‘the charter we are to approve today both strengthens and gives visible shape to the common fundamental rights and values our community is to be based upon. ’ a.

In a somewhat orthogonal approach to ours, (Ma et al. , 2007) use alignment of a parallel text to pack together adjacent segments in the alignment output, which are then fed back to the word aligner to bootstrap an improved alignment, which is then used in the translation model. We compared our results against (Luong et al. , 2010) in Table 3 since their results are directly comparable to ours. They use a segmented phrase table and language model along with the word-based versions in the decoder and in tuning a Finnish target. Their approach requires segmented phrases 39 to match word boundaries, eliminating morphologically productive phrases. In their work a segmented language model can score a translation, but cannot insert morphology that does not show source-side reflexes. In order to perform a similar experiment that still allowed for morphologically productive phrases, we tried training a segmented translation model, the output of which we stitched up in tuning so as to tune to a word-based reference. The goal of this experiment was to control the segmented model’s tendency to overfit by rewarding it for using correct whole-word forms. However, we found that this approach was less successful than using the segmented reference in tuning, and could not meet the baseline (13.97% BLEU best tuning score, versus 14.93% BLEU for the baseline best tuning score) . Previous work in segmented translation has often used linguistically motivated morphological analysis selectively applied based on a language-specific heuristic. A typical approach is to select a highly inflecting class of words and segment them for particular morphology (de Gispert and Mari n˜o, 2008; Ramanathan et al. , 2009) . Popovi¸ c and Ney (2004) perform segmentation to reduce morphological complexity of the source to translate into an isolating target, reducing the translation error rate for the English target. For Czech-to-English, Goldwater and McClosky (2005) lemmatized the source text and inserted a set of ‘pseudowords’ expected to have lexical reflexes in English. Minkov et. al. (2007) and Toutanova et. al. (2008) use a Maximum Entropy Markov Model for morphology generation. The main drawback to this approach is that it removes morphological information from the translation model (which only uses stems) ; this can be a problem for languages in which morphology ex- presses lexical content. de Gispert (2008) uses a language-specific targeted morphological classifier for Spanish verbs to avoid this issue. Talbot and Osborne (2006) use clustering to group morphological variants of words for word alignments and for smoothing phrase translation tables. Habash (2007) provides various methods to incorporate morphological variants of words in the phrase table in order to help recognize out of vocabulary words in the source language. 5 Conclusion and Future Work We found that using a segmented translation model based on unsupervised morphology induction and a model that combined morpheme segments in the translation model with a postprocessing morphology prediction model gave us better BLEU scores than a word-based baseline. Using our proposed approach we obtain better scores than the state of the art on the EnglishFinnish translation task (Luong et al. , 2010) : from 14.82% BLEU to 15.09%, while using a 40 simpler model. We show that using morphological segmentation in the translation model can improve output translation scores. We also demonstrate that for Finnish (and possibly other agglutinative languages) , phrase-based MT benefits from allowing the translation model access to morphological segmentation yielding productive morphological phrases. Taking advantage of linguistic analysis of the output we show that using a post-processing morphology generation model can improve translation fluency on a sub-word level, in a manner that is not captured by the BLEU word-based evaluation measure. In order to help with replication of the results in this paper, we have run the various morphological analysis steps and created the necessary training, tuning and test data files needed in order to train, tune and test any phrase-based machine translation system with our data. The files can be downloaded from natlang. cs.sfu. ca. In future work we hope to explore the utility of phrases with productive morpheme boundaries and explore why they are not used more pervasively in the decoder. Evaluation measures for morphologically complex languages and tun- ing to those measures are also important future work directions. Also, we would like to explore a non-pipelined approach to morphological preand post-processing so that a globally trained model could be used to remove the target side morphemes that would improve the translation model and then predict those morphemes in the target language.

<p>Author: Yanjun Ma ; Yifan He ; Andy Way ; Josef van Genabith</p><p>Abstract: We present a discriminative learning method to improve the consistency of translations in phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems. Our method is inspired by Translation Memory (TM) systems which are widely used by human translators in industrial settings. We constrain the translation of an input sentence using the most similar ‘translation example’ retrieved from the TM. Differently from previous research which used simple fuzzy match thresholds, these constraints are imposed using discriminative learning to optimise the translation performance. We observe that using this method can benefit the SMT system by not only producing consistent translations, but also improved translation outputs. We report a 0.9 point improvement in terms of BLEU score on English–Chinese technical documents.</p><p>3 0.81276721 <a title="313-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-Crowdsourcing_Translation%3A_Professional_Quality_from_Non-Professionals.html">90 acl-2011-Crowdsourcing Translation: Professional Quality from Non-Professionals</a></p>
<p>Author: Omar F. Zaidan ; Chris Callison-Burch</p><p>Abstract: Naively collecting translations by crowdsourcing the task to non-professional translators yields disfluent, low-quality results if no quality control is exercised. We demonstrate a variety of mechanisms that increase the translation quality to near professional levels. Specifically, we solicit redundant translations and edits to them, and automatically select the best output among them. We propose a set of features that model both the translations and the translators, such as country of residence, LM perplexity of the translation, edit rate from the other translations, and (optionally) calibration against professional translators. Using these features to score the collected translations, we are able to discriminate between acceptable and unacceptable translations. We recreate the NIST 2009 Urdu-toEnglish evaluation set with Mechanical Turk, and quantitatively show that our models are able to select translations within the range of quality that we expect from professional trans- lators. The total cost is more than an order of magnitude lower than professional translation.</p><p>4 0.80749738 <a title="313-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Translationese_and_Its_Dialects.html">311 acl-2011-Translationese and Its Dialects</a></p>
<p>Author: Moshe Koppel ; Noam Ordan</p><p>Abstract: While it is has often been observed that the product of translation is somehow different than non-translated text, scholars have emphasized two distinct bases for such differences. Some have noted interference from the source language spilling over into translation in a source-language-specific way, while others have noted general effects of the process of translation that are independent of source language. Using a series of text categorization experiments, we show that both these effects exist and that, moreover, there is a continuum between them. There are many effects of translation that are consistent among texts translated from a given source language, some of which are consistent even among texts translated from families of source languages. Significantly, we find that even for widely unrelated source languages and multiple genres, differences between translated texts and non-translated texts are sufficient for a learned classifier to accurately determine if a given text is translated or original.</p><p>5 0.7828263 <a title="313-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Hindi_to_Punjabi_Machine_Translation_System.html">151 acl-2011-Hindi to Punjabi Machine Translation System</a></p>
<p>Author: Vishal Goyal ; Gurpreet Singh Lehal</p><p>Abstract: Hindi-Punjabi being closely related language pair (Goyal V. and Lehal G.S., 2008) , Hybrid Machine Translation approach has been used for developing Hindi to Punjabi Machine Translation System. Non-availability of lexical resources, spelling variations in the source language text, source text ambiguous words, named entity recognition and collocations are the major challenges faced while developing this syetm. The key activities involved during translation process are preprocessing, translation engine and post processing. Lookup algorithms, pattern matching algorithms etc formed the basis for solving these issues. The system accuracy has been evaluated using intelligibility test, accuracy test and BLEU score. The hybrid syatem is found to perform better than the constituent systems. Keywords: Machine Translation, Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing, Hindi, Punjabi. Translate Hindi to Punjabi, Closely related languages. 1Introduction Machine Translation system is a software designed that essentially takes a text in one language (called the source language), and translates it into another language (called the target language). There are number of approaches for MT like Direct based, Transform based, Interlingua based, Statistical etc. But the choice of approach depends upon the available resources and the kind of languages involved. In general, if the two languages are structurally similar, in particular as regards lexical correspondences, morphology and word order, the case for abstract syntactic analysis seems less convincing. Since the present research work deals with a pair of closely related language 1 Gurpreet Singh Lehal Department of Computer Science Punjabi University, Patiala,India gs lehal @ gmai l com . i.e. Hindi-Punjabi , thus direct word-to-word translation approach is the obvious choice. As some rule based approach has also been used, thus, Hybrid approach has been adopted for developing the system. An exhaustive survey has already been given for existing machine translations systems developed so far mentioning their accuracies and limitations. (Goyal V. and Lehal G.S., 2009). 2 System Architecture 2.1 Pre Processing Phase The preprocessing stage is a collection of operations that are applied on input data to make it processable by the translation engine. In the first phase of Machine Translation system, various activities incorporated include text normalization, replacing collocations and replacing proper nouns. 2.2 Text Normalization The variety in the alphabet, different dialects and influence of foreign languages has resulted in spelling variations of the same word. Such variations sometimes can be treated as errors in writing. (Goyal V. and Lehal G.S., 2010). 2.3 Replacing Collocations After passing the input text through text normalization, the text passes through this Collocation replacement sub phase of Preprocessing phase. Collocation is two or more consecutive words with a special behavior. (Choueka :1988). For example, the collocation उ?र ?देश (uttar pradēsh) if translated word to word, will be translated as ਜਵਾਬ ਰਾਜ (javāb rāj) but it must be translated as ਉ?ਤਰ ਪ?ਦਸ਼ੇ (uttar pradēsh). The accuracy of the results for collocation extraction using t-test is not accurate and includes number of such bigrams and trigrams that are not actually collocations. Thus, manually such entries were removed and actual collocations were further extracted.

The collocation table of the database consists of 5000 such entries. In this sub phase, the normalized input text is analyzed. Each collocation in the database found in the input text will be replaced with the Punjabi translation of the corresponding collocation. It is found that when tested on a corpus containing about 1,00,000 words, only 0.001 % collocations were found and replaced during the translation. Hindi Text Figure 1: Overview of Hindi-Punjabi Machine Translation System 2.4 Replacing Proper Nouns A great proposition of unseen words includes proper nouns like personal, days of month, days of week, country names, city names, bank fastens words proper decide the translation process. Once these are recognized and stored into the noun database, there is no need to about their translation or transliteration names, organization names, ocean names, river every names, university words names etc. and if translated time in the case of presence in word to word, their meaning is changed. If the gazetteer meaning is not affected, even though this step fast. This input makes list text for the translation is self of such translation. growing This accurate and during each 2 translation. Thus, to process this sub phase, the system requires a proper noun gazetteer that has been complied offline. For this task, we have developed an offline module to extract proper nouns from the corpus based on some rules. Also, Named Entity recognition module has been developed based on the CRF approach (Sharma R. and Goyal V., 2011b). 2.5 Tokenizer Tokenizers (also known as lexical analyzers or word segmenters) segment a stream of characters into meaningful units called tokens. The tokenizer takes the text generated by pre processing phase as input. Individual words or tokens are extracted and processed to generate its equivalent in the target language. This module, using space, a punctuation mark, as delimiter, extracts tokens (word) one by one from the text and gives it to translation engine for analysis till the complete input text is read and processed. 2.6 Translation Engine The translation engine is the main component of our Machine Translation system. It takes token generated by the tokenizer as input and outputs the translated token in the target language. These translated tokens are concatenated one after another along with the delimiter. Modules included in this phase are explained below one by one. 2.6.1 Identifying Titles and Surnames Title may be defined as a formal appellation attached to the name of a person or family by virtue of office, rank, hereditary privilege, noble birth, or attainment or used as a mark of respect. Thus word next to title and word previous to surname is usually a proper noun. And sometimes, a word used as proper name of a person has its own meaning in target language. Similarly, Surname may be defined as a name shared in common to identify the members of a family, as distinguished from each member's given name. It is also called family name or last name. When either title or surname is passed through the translation engine, it is translated by the system. This cause the system failure as these proper names should be transliterated instead of translation. For example consider the Hindi sentence 3 ?ीमान हष? जी हमार ेयहाँ पधार।े (shrīmān harsh jī हष? hamārē yahāṃ padhārē). In this sentence, (harsh) has the meaning “joy”. The equivalent translation of हष? (harsh) in target language is ਖੁਸ਼ੀ (khushī). Similarly, consider the Hindi sentence ?काश ?सह हमार े (prakāsh siṃh hamārē yahāṃ padhārē). Here, ?काश (prakāsh) word is acting as proper noun and it must be transliterated and not translated because (siṃh) is surname and word previous to it is proper noun. Thus, a small module has been developed for यहाँ पधार।े. ?सह locating such proper nouns to consider them as title or surname. There is one special character ‘॰’ in Devanagari script to mark the symbols like डा॰, ?ो॰. If this module found this symbol to be title or surname, the word next and previous to this token as the case may be for title or surname respectively, will be transliterated not translated. The title and surname database consists of 14 and 654 entries respectively. These databases can be extended at any time to allow new titles and surnames to be added. This module was tested on a large Hindi corpus and showed that about 2-5 % text of the input text depending upon its domain is proper noun. Thus, this module plays an important role in translation. 2.6.2 Hindi Morphological analyzer This module finds the root word for the token and its morphological features.Morphological analyzer developed by IIT-H has been ported for Windows platform for making it usable for this system. (Goyal V. and Lehal G.S.,2008a) 2.6.3 Word-to-Word translation using lexicon lookup If token is not a title or a surname, it is looked up in the HPDictionary database containing Hindi to Punjabi direct word to word translation. If it is found, it is used for translation. If no entry is found in HPDictionary database, it is sent to next sub phase for processing. The HPDictionary database consists of 54, 127 entries.This database can be extended at any time to allow new entries in the dictionary to be added. 2.6.4 Resolving Ambiguity Among number of approaches for disambiguation, the most appropriate approach to determine the correct meaning of a Hindi word in a particular usage for our Machine Translation system is to examine its context using N-gram approach. After analyzing the past experiences of various authors, we have chosen the value of n to be 3 and 2 i.e. trigram and bigram approaches respectively for our system. Trigrams are further categorized into three different types. First category of trigram consists of context one word previous to and one word next to the ambiguous word. Second category of trigram consists of context of two adjacent previous words to the ambiguous word. Third category of the trigram consists of context of two adjacent next words to the ambiguous word. Bigrams are also categorized into two categories. First category of the bigrams consists of context of one previous word to ambiguous word and second category of the bigrams consists of one context word next to ambiguous word. For this purpose, the Hindi corpus consisting of about 2 million words was collected from different sources like online newspaper daily news, blogs, Prem Chand stories, Yashwant jain stories, articles etc. The most common list of ambiguous words was found. We have found a list of 75 ambiguous words out of which the most are स े sē and aur. (Goyal V. and frequent Lehal G.S., 2011) और 2.6.5 Handling Unknown Words 2.6.5.1 Word Inflectional Analysis and generation In linguistics, a suffix (also sometimes called a postfix or ending) is an affix which is placed after the stem of a word. Common examples are case endings, which indicate the grammatical case of nouns or adjectives, and verb endings. Hindi is a (relatively) free wordorder and highly inflectional language. Because of same origin, both languages have very similar structure and grammar. The difference is only in words and in pronunciation e.g. in Hindi it is लड़का and in Punjabi the word for boy is ਮੰੁਡਾ and even sometimes that is also not there like घर (ghar) and ਘਰ (ghar). The inflection forms of both these words in Hindi and Punjabi are also similar. In this activity, inflectional analysis without using morphology has been performed 4 for all those tokens that are not processed by morphological analysis module. Thus, for performing inflectional analysis, rule based approach has been followed. When the token is passed to this sub phase for inflectional analysis, If any pattern of the regular expression (inflection rule) matches with this token, that rule is applied on the token and its equivalent translation in Punjabi is generated based on the matched rule(s). There is also a check on the generated word for its correctness. We are using correct Punjabi words database for testing the correctness of the generated word. 2.6.5.2 Transliteration This module is beneficial for handling out-ofvocabulary words. For example the word िवशाल is as ਿਵਸ਼ਾਲ (vishāl) whereas translated as ਵੱਡਾ. There must be some method in every Machine Translation system for words like technical terms and (vishāl) transliterated proper names of persons, places, objects etc. that cannot be found in translation resources such as Hindi-Punjabi bilingual dictionary, surnames database, titles database etc and transliteration is an obvious choice for such words. (Goyal V. and Lehal G.S., 2009a). 2.7 Post-Processing 2.7.1 Agreement Corrections In spite of the great similarity between Hindi and Punjabi, there are still a number of important agreement divergences in gender and number. The output generated by the translation engine phase becomes the input for post-processing phase. This phase will correct the agreement errors based on the rules implemented in the form of regular expressions. (Goyal V. and Lehal G.S., 2011) 3 Evaluation and Results The evaluation document set consisted of documents from various online newspapers news, articles, blogs, biographies etc. This test bed consisted of 35500 words and was translated using our Machine Translation system. 3.1 Test Document For our Machine Translation system evaluation, we have used benchmark sampling method for selecting the set of sentences. Input sentences are selected from randomly selected news (sports, politics, world, regional, entertainment, travel etc.), articles (published by various writers, philosophers etc.), literature (stories by Prem Chand, Yashwant jain etc.), Official language for office letters (The Language Officially used on the files in Government offices) and blogs (Posted by general public in forums etc.). Care has been taken to ensure that sentences use a variety of constructs. All possible constructs including simple as well as complex ones are incorporated in the set. The sentence set also contains all types of sentences such as declarative, interrogative, imperative and exclamatory. Sentence length is not restricted although care has been taken that single sentences do not become too long. Following table shows the test data set: Table 1: Test data set for the evaluation of Hindi to Punjabi Machine Translation DTSWeo nctaruldenmscent 91DN03ae, 4wil0ys A5230,1rt6ic70lS4esytO0LQ38m6,1au5f4no9itg3c5e1uiaslgeB5130,lo6g50 L29105i,te84r05atue 3.2 Experiments It is also important to choose appropriate evaluators for our experiments. Thus, depending upon the requirements and need of the above mentioned tests, 50 People of different professions were selected for performing experiments. 20 Persons were from villages that only knew Punjabi and did not know Hindi and 30 persons were from different professions having knowledge of both Hindi and Punjabi. Average ratings for the sentences of the individual translations were then summed up (separately according to intelligibility and accuracy) to get the average scores. Percentage of accurate sentences and intelligent sentences was also calculated separately sentences. by counting the number of 3.2.1 Intelligibility Evaluation 5 The evaluators do not have any clue about the source language i.e. Hindi. They judge each sentence (in target language i.e. Punjabi) on the basis of its comprehensibility. The target user is a layman who is interested only in the comprehensibility of translations. Intelligibility is effected by grammatical errors, mistranslations, and un-translated words. 3.2.1.1 Results The response by the evaluators were analysed and following are the results: • 70.3 % sentences got the score 3 i.e. they were perfectly clear and intelligible. • 25. 1 % sentences got the score 2 i.e. they were generally clear and intelligible. • 3.5 % sentences got the score 1i.e. they were hard to understand. • 1. 1 % sentences got the score 0 i.e. they were not understandable. So we can say that about 95.40 % sentences are intelligible. These sentences are those which have score 2 or above. Thus, we can say that the direct approach can translate Hindi text to Punjabi Text with a consideably good accuracy. 3.2.2 Accuracy Evaluation / Fidelity Measure The evaluators are provided with source text along with translated text. A highly intelligible output sentence need not be a correct translation of the source sentence. It is important to check whether the meaning of the source language sentence is preserved in the translation. This property is called accuracy. 3.2.2.1 Results Initially Null Hypothesis is assumed i.e. the system’s performance is NULL. The author assumes that system is dumb and does not produce any valuable output. By the intelligibility of the analysis and Accuracy analysis, it has been proved wrong. The accuracy percentage for the system is found out to be 87.60% Further investigations reveal that out of 13.40%: • 80.6 % sentences achieve a match between 50 to 99% • 17.2 % of remaining sentences were marked with less than 50% match against the correct sentences. • Only 2.2 % sentences are those which are found unfaithful. A match of lower 50% does not mean that the sentences are not usable. After some post editing, they can fit properly in the translated text. (Goyal, V., Lehal, G.S., 2009b) 3.2.2 BLEU Score: As there is no Hindi –Parallel Corpus was available, thus for testing the system automatically, we generated Hindi-Parallel Corpus of about 10K Sentences. The BLEU score comes out to be 0.7801. 5 Conclusion In this paper, a hybrid translation approach for translating the text from Hindi to Punjabi has been presented. The proposed architecture has shown extremely good results and if found to be appropriate for MT systems between closely related language pairs.

<p>Author: Roger Levy</p><p>Abstract: A system making optimal use of available information in incremental language comprehension might be expected to use linguistic knowledge together with current input to revise beliefs about previous input. Under some circumstances, such an error-correction capability might induce comprehenders to adopt grammatical analyses that are inconsistent with the true input. Here we present a formal model of how such input-unfaithful garden paths may be adopted and the difficulty incurred by their subsequent disconfirmation, combining a rational noisy-channel model of syntactic comprehension under uncertain input with the surprisal theory of incremental processing difficulty. We also present a behavioral experiment confirming the key empirical predictions of the theory.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.81694311 <a title="313-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Two_Easy_Improvements_to_Lexical_Weighting.html">313 acl-2011-Two Easy Improvements to Lexical Weighting</a></p>
<p>Author: David Chiang ; Steve DeNeefe ; Michael Pust</p><p>Abstract: We introduce two simple improvements to the lexical weighting features of Koehn, Och, and Marcu (2003) for machine translation: one which smooths the probability of translating word f to word e by simplifying English morphology, and one which conditions it on the kind of training data that f and e co-occurred in. These new variations lead to improvements of up to +0.8 BLEU, with an average improvement of +0.6 BLEU across two language pairs, two genres, and two translation systems.</p><p>3 0.797454 <a title="313-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Judging_Grammaticality_with_Tree_Substitution_Grammar_Derivations.html">188 acl-2011-Judging Grammaticality with Tree Substitution Grammar Derivations</a></p>
<p>Author: Matt Post</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we show that local features computed from the derivations of tree substitution grammars such as the identify of particular fragments, and a count of large and small fragments are useful in binary grammatical classification tasks. Such features outperform n-gram features and various model scores by a wide margin. Although they fall short of the performance of the hand-crafted feature set of Charniak and Johnson (2005) developed for parse tree reranking, they do so with an order of magnitude fewer features. Furthermore, since the TSGs employed are learned in a Bayesian setting, the use of their derivations can be viewed as the automatic discovery of tree patterns useful for classification. On the BLLIP dataset, we achieve an accuracy of 89.9% in discriminating between grammatical text and samples from an n-gram language model. — —</p><p>4 0.75209248 <a title="313-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Extracting_Social_Power_Relationships_from_Natural_Language.html">133 acl-2011-Extracting Social Power Relationships from Natural Language</a></p>
<p>Author: Philip Bramsen ; Martha Escobar-Molano ; Ami Patel ; Rafael Alonso</p><p>Abstract: Sociolinguists have long argued that social context influences language use in all manner of ways, resulting in lects 1. This paper explores a text classification problem we will call lect modeling, an example of what has been termed computational sociolinguistics. In particular, we use machine learning techniques to identify social power relationships between members of a social network, based purely on the content of their interpersonal communication. We rely on statistical methods, as opposed to language-specific engineering, to extract features which represent vocabulary and grammar usage indicative of social power lect. We then apply support vector machines to model the social power lects representing superior-subordinate communication in the Enron email corpus. Our results validate the treatment of lect modeling as a text classification problem – albeit a hard one – and constitute a case for future research in computational sociolinguistics. 1</p><p>5 0.7517851 <a title="313-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Prototyping_virtual_instructors_from_human-human_corpora.html">252 acl-2011-Prototyping virtual instructors from human-human corpora</a></p>

In this paper we present a novel algorithm for rapidly prototyping virtual instructors from human-human corpora without manual annotation. Automatically prototyping full-fledged dialogue systems from corpora is far from being a reality nowadays. Our algorithm is restricted in that only the virtual instructor can perform speech acts while the user responses are limited to physical actions in the virtual world. We evaluate a virtual instructor, generated using this algorithm, with human users. We compare our results both with human instructors and rule-based virtual instructors hand-coded for the same task.</p><p>6 0.75175202 <a title="313-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Model-Based_Aligner_Combination_Using_Dual_Decomposition.html">221 acl-2011-Model-Based Aligner Combination Using Dual Decomposition</a></p>

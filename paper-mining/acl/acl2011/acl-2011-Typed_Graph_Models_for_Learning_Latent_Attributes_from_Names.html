<p>Author: Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan ; Jacob Goldberger</p><p>Abstract: Extensive knowledge bases ofentailment rules between predicates are crucial for applied semantic inference. In this paper we propose an algorithm that utilizes transitivity constraints to learn a globally-optimal set of entailment rules for typed predicates. We model the task as a graph learning problem and suggest methods that scale the algorithm to larger graphs. We apply the algorithm over a large data set of extracted predicate instances, from which a resource of typed entailment rules has been recently released (Schoenmackers et al., 2010). Our results show that using global transitivity information substantially improves performance over this resource and several baselines, and that our scaling methods allow us to increase the scope of global learning of entailment-rule graphs.</p><p>4 0.13409144 <a title="314-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Simple_supervised_document_geolocation_with_geodesic_grids.html">285 acl-2011-Simple supervised document geolocation with geodesic grids</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin Wing ; Jason Baldridge</p><p>Abstract: We investigate automatic geolocation (i.e. identification of the location, expressed as latitude/longitude coordinates) of documents. Geolocation can be an effective means of summarizing large document collections and it is an important component of geographic information retrieval. We describe several simple supervised methods for document geolocation using only the documentâ€™s raw text as evidence. All of our methods predict locations in the context of geodesic grids of varying degrees of resolution. We evaluate the methods on geotagged Wikipedia articles and Twitter feeds. For Wikipedia, our best method obtains a median prediction error of just 11.8 kilometers. Twitter geolocation is more challenging: we obtain a median error of 479 km, an improvement on previous results for the dataset.</p><p>5 0.13259132 <a title="314-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Disentangling_Chat_with_Local_Coherence_Models.html">101 acl-2011-Disentangling Chat with Local Coherence Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Dipanjan Das ; Slav Petrov</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel approach for inducing unsupervised part-of-speech taggers for languages that have no labeled training data, but have translated text in a resource-rich language. Our method does not assume any knowledge about the target language (in particular no tagging dictionary is assumed), making it applicable to a wide array of resource-poor languages. We use graph-based label propagation for cross-lingual knowledge transfer and use the projected labels as features in an unsupervised model (BergKirkpatrick et al., 2010). Across eight European languages, our approach results in an average absolute improvement of 10.4% over a state-of-the-art baseline, and 16.7% over vanilla hidden Markov models induced with the Expectation Maximization algorithm.</p><p>4 0.50188297 <a title="314-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Extending_the_Entity_Grid_with_Entity-Specific_Features.html">129 acl-2011-Extending the Entity Grid with Entity-Specific Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Zornitsa Kozareva ; Eduard Hovy</p><p>Abstract: Text mining and data harvesting algorithms have become popular in the computational linguistics community. They employ patterns that specify the kind of information to be harvested, and usually bootstrap either the pattern learning or the term harvesting process (or both) in a recursive cycle, using data learned in one step to generate more seeds for the next. They therefore treat the source text corpus as a network, in which words are the nodes and relations linking them are the edges. The results of computational network analysis, especially from the world wide web, are thus applicable. Surprisingly, these results have not yet been broadly introduced into the computational linguistics community. In this paper we show how various results apply to text mining, how they explain some previously observed phenomena, and how they can be helpful for computational linguistics applications.</p><p>6 0.47205713 <a title="314-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Identifying_the_Semantic_Orientation_of_Foreign_Words.html">162 acl-2011-Identifying the Semantic Orientation of Foreign Words</a></p>

<p>Author: Antske Fokkens</p><p>Abstract: When designing grammars of natural language, typically, more than one formal analysis can account for a given phenomenon. Moreover, because analyses interact, the choices made by the engineer influence the possibilities available in further grammar development. The order in which phenomena are treated may therefore have a major impact on the resulting grammar. This paper proposes to tackle this problem by using metagrammar development as a methodology for grammar engineering. Iargue that metagrammar engineering as an approach facilitates the systematic exploration of grammars through comparison of competing analyses. The idea is illustrated through a comparative study of auxiliary structures in HPSG-based grammars for German and Dutch. Auxiliaries form a central phenomenon of German and Dutch and are likely to influence many components of the grammar. This study shows that a special auxiliary+verb construction significantly improves efficiency compared to the standard argument-composition analysis for both parsing and generation.</p><p>3 0.74177384 <a title="314-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Event_Discovery_in_Social_Media_Feeds.html">121 acl-2011-Event Discovery in Social Media Feeds</a></p>
<p>Author: Edward Benson ; Aria Haghighi ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method for record extraction from social streams such as Twitter. Unlike typical extraction setups, these environments are characterized by short, one sentence messages with heavily colloquial speech. To further complicate matters, individual messages may not express the full relation to be uncovered, as is often assumed in extraction tasks. We develop a graphical model that addresses these problems by learning a latent set of records and a record-message alignment simultaneously; the output of our model is a set of canonical records, the values of which are consistent with aligned messages. We demonstrate that our approach is able to accurately induce event records from Twitter messages, evaluated against events from a local city guide. Our method achieves significant error reduction over baseline methods.1</p><p>4 0.74116725 <a title="314-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Content_Models_with_Attitude.html">82 acl-2011-Content Models with Attitude</a></p>
<p>Author: Christina Sauper ; Aria Haghighi ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: We present a probabilistic topic model for jointly identifying properties and attributes of social media review snippets. Our model simultaneously learns a set of properties of a product and captures aggregate user sentiments towards these properties. This approach directly enables discovery of highly rated or inconsistent properties of a product. Our model admits an efficient variational meanfield inference algorithm which can be parallelized and run on large snippet collections. We evaluate our model on a large corpus of snippets from Yelp reviews to assess property and attribute prediction. We demonstrate that it outperforms applicable baselines by a considerable margin.</p><p>5 0.7385776 <a title="314-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Fully_Unsupervised_Word_Segmentation_with_BVE_and_MDL.html">140 acl-2011-Fully Unsupervised Word Segmentation with BVE and MDL</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Hewlett ; Paul Cohen</p><p>Abstract: Several results in the word segmentation literature suggest that description length provides a useful estimate of segmentation quality in fully unsupervised settings. However, since the space of potential segmentations grows exponentially with the length of the corpus, no tractable algorithm follows directly from the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. Therefore, it is necessary to generate a set of candidate segmentations and select between them according to the MDL principle. We evaluate several algorithms for generating these candidate segmentations on a range of natural language corpora, and show that the Bootstrapped Voting Experts algorithm consistently outperforms other methods when paired with MDL.</p><p>6 0.73715955 <a title="314-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Why_Initialization_Matters_for_IBM_Model_1%3A_Multiple_Optima_and_Non-Strict_Convexity.html">335 acl-2011-Why Initialization Matters for IBM Model 1: Multiple Optima and Non-Strict Convexity</a></p>

</p><p>2 The flexibility of UIMA to support all types of unstructured data – images, audio, and text – increases the complexity of some of the most common NLP development tasks. [sent-9, score-0.127]
</p><p>3 The Annotation Librarian interface handles these common functions and allows the creation and management of annotations by mirroring Java methods used to manipulate Strings. [sent-10, score-0.512]
</p><p>4 The familiar syntax and NLP-centric design allows developers to adopt and rapidly develop NLP algorithms in UIMA. [sent-11, score-0.334]
</p><p>5 The general functionality of the interface is described in relation to the use cases that necessitated its creation. [sent-12, score-0.433]
</p><p>6 1  Introduction  In the days when public libraries were the center of information exchange, the job of the librarian was to serve as an interface between the complex library system and the average user. [sent-13, score-0.651]
</p><p>7 The librarian made it possible for one to access specific sources of information without memorizing the Dewey Decimal System or flipping through the card catalog. [sent-14, score-0.493]
</p><p>8 Analogous to the great librarians of yesteryear, the Annotation Librarian serves the average Java developer in the creation and management of annotations within natural language processing (NLP) projects built using the open source Apache Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA)1. [sent-15, score-0.403]
</p><p>9 Many NLP tasks are performed in processing steps that build upon one another. [sent-16, score-0.03]
</p><p>10 Systems designed in this fashion are called pipelines because 1 Apache UIMA is available from http://uima. [sent-17, score-0.053]
</p><p>11 org/ 139 text is processed and then passed from one step to the next like water flowing through a pipe. [sent-19, score-0.071]
</p><p>12 Each step in the pipeline adds structured data on top of the text called annotations. [sent-20, score-0.067]
</p><p>13 An annotation can be as simple as a classification of a span of text or  complex with attributes and mappings to coded values. [sent-21, score-0.248]
</p><p>14 As pipeline systems have caught on, the ability to standardize functionality in and even across pipelines has emerged. [sent-22, score-0.361]
</p><p>15 UIMA provides a powerful infrastructure for the storage, transport, and retrieval of document and annotation knowledge accumulated in NLP pipeline systems (Ferrucci 2004). [sent-23, score-0.28]
</p><p>16 Because UIMA provides the underlying data model for storing meta-data and annotations with document text and the interface for interacting between processing steps, it has become a popular platform for the development of reusable NLP systems (D’Avolio 2010, Coden 2009, Savova 2008). [sent-25, score-0.482]
</p><p>17 The most notable example of UIMA capabilities is Watson, the question-answering system that competed and won two Jeopardy! [sent-26, score-0.032]
</p><p>18 In addition to its successful implementations in NLP, UIMA supports all types of unstructured information – video, audio, images, etc – and so all UIMA constructs generalize beyond text. [sent-28, score-0.126]
</p><p>19 While  handling multiple data types increases the utility of the framework, developers new to UIMA may feel they need to understand the entire framework before being able to distinguish and focus solely on text. [sent-29, score-0.219]
</p><p>20 The Annotation Librarian aids both novice and experienced UIMA developers by providing intuitive and NLP-centric functionality. [sent-30, score-0.315]
</p><p>21 It provides convenience methods that mirror Java String manipulation, allowing developers to seamlessly combine document text and annotations with the same commands familiar to anyone who has parsed a String or written a regular expression. [sent-36, score-0.659]
</p><p>22 Advanced functionality allows developers to examine spatial  relationships among annotations and perform annotation pattern matching. [sent-37, score-0.784]
</p><p>23 In this demonstration, we present the general functionality of the Annotation Librarian in the context of the health care research projects that necessitated the creation of the interface. [sent-38, score-0.507]
</p><p>24 The interface does not replace the need for NLP algorithms – developers have a plethora of patterns and decision rules, symbolic grammars, and machine learning techniques to create annotations. [sent-39, score-0.442]
</p><p>25 The Annotation Toolkit, though, provides a convenient way for developers to use existing annotations in their algorithms. [sent-40, score-0.346]
</p><p>26 This feeds the pipeline workflow that allows more complex annotations to be built in later processing steps using the annotations created in earlier steps. [sent-41, score-0.49]
</p><p>27 The Annotation Librarian was developed and modified in response to four research projects in the health care domain that relied on NLP extraction of concepts from clinical text. [sent-42, score-0.251]
</p><p>28 The diversity of the different tasks in each of these use cases allowed the interface to include functionality common to different types of NLP system development. [sent-43, score-0.358]
</p><p>29 Interface functionality will be described as groups of related methods in the context of the four research projects and cover pattern  matching, span overlap, relative position, annotation modification, and retrieval. [sent-44, score-0.534]
</p><p>30 All projects received Institutional Review Board approval for data use and only synthetic documents, not real patient records, are shown in the examples presented in this paper. [sent-45, score-0.238]
</p><p>31 3  Pattern Matching  Name entity recognition and semantic classification tasks often require advanced concept identifi140 cation techniques. [sent-46, score-0.034]
</p><p>32 Identifying mentions of prescriptions in a document using regular expressions, for example, would require hundreds of thousands of patterns for names of medicines and have to account for misspelling, abbreviations, and acronyms. [sent-47, score-0.143]
</p><p>33 Regular expressions are commonly used to solve simple NLP tasks, though, and can be utilized as part of a more complex information extraction strategy, such as understanding the context in which a term is used in the text (Garvin 201 1, McCrae 2008, Frenz 2007, Chapman 2001). [sent-48, score-0.035]
</p><p>34 Negex (Chapman 2001) is an algorithm for identifying words before or after a term that suggest, for ex-  ample, that a particular symptom is not present in a patient: “the patient has no fever. [sent-49, score-0.15]
</p><p>35 ” Other methods for understanding the context around terms include the use of an inclusion and exclusion list (Akbar 2009), temporal locality search (Grouin 2009), window search (Li 2009), and combinations of the above techniques (Hamon 2009). [sent-50, score-0.031]
</p><p>36 The Annotation Librarian allows patterns to be built using existing annotations along with document text. [sent-51, score-0.247]
</p><p>37 This functionality combines the power of finding concepts that require complex means with the simplicity of regular expressions. [sent-52, score-0.296]
</p><p>38 The syntax mirrors that of the Java Pattern3 and Matcher4 classes, but allows for an extended regular expression grammar to identify Annotations. [sent-53, score-0.136]
</p><p>39 Pattern matching is accomplished in three phases: the input pattern is compiled, the document and annotations are analyzed for matches, and matches are returned along with span information. [sent-54, score-0.413]
</p><p>40 A project identifying positive microbiology cultures will illustrate the use of pattern matching with the Annotation Librarian. [sent-55, score-0.353]
</p><p>41 Clinicians order microbiology cultures to determine whether a patient has a bacterial infection and which antibiotics would be most effective at treating the infection. [sent-56, score-0.305]
</p><p>42 Susceptibility is the measure of whether an antibi-  otic can effectively treat an organism or whether the organism is resistant to it. [sent-57, score-0.291]
</p><p>43 A sample of microbiology report text is shown in Figure 1 and visualized annotations for the same sample are shown in Figure 2. [sent-58, score-0.286]
</p><p>44 html  To demonstrate pattern matching in this sample, the simple pattern of a drug annotation followed by an equals sign and then by a susceptibility annotation will be used. [sent-65, score-0.686]
</p><p>45 1 Pattern Compilation The pattern matching process begins when a new instance of an AnnotationPattern is created from the static compile method. [sent-67, score-0.161]
</p><p>46 AnnotationPatte rn su s cept ibi l tyPattern i Annotat ionPattern  . [sent-69, score-0.104]
</p><p>47 compi l ( “patte e  rn ” ) ;  =  The method takes advantage of the UIMA implementation of annotations. [sent-70, score-0.125]
</p><p>48 Each annotation is an instance of a class that inherits from the UIMA class Annotation5. [sent-71, score-0.171]
</p><p>49 UIMA allows developers to create new types of annotations (in this example Organism, Antibiotic, and Susceptibility) that become Java classes. [sent-72, score-0.384]

As previous research shows, these differences severely limit the applicability of Marking up search queries with linguistic annotations such as part-of-speech tags, capitalization, and segmentation, is an impor- tant part of query processing and understanding in information retrieval systems. Due to their brevity and idiosyncratic structure, search queries pose a challenge to existing NLP tools. To address this challenge, we propose a probabilistic approach for performing joint query annotation. First, we derive a robust set of unsupervised independent annotations, using queries and pseudo-relevance feedback. Then, we stack additional classifiers on the independent annotations, and exploit the dependencies between them to further improve the accuracy, even with a very limited amount of available training data. We evaluate our method using a range of queries extracted from a web search log. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our approach for both short keyword queries, and verbose natural language queries.</p><p>4 0.055911761 <a title="42-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Clairlib%3A_A_Toolkit_for_Natural_Language_Processing%2C_Information_Retrieval%2C_and_Network_Analysis.html">67 acl-2011-Clairlib: A Toolkit for Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Network Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Lonneke van der Plas ; Paola Merlo ; James Henderson</p><p>Abstract: Broad-coverage semantic annotations for training statistical learners are only available for a handful of languages. Previous approaches to cross-lingual transfer of semantic annotations have addressed this problem with encouraging results on a small scale. In this paper, we scale up previous efforts by using an automatic approach to semantic annotation that does not rely on a semantic ontology for the target language. Moreover, we improve the quality of the transferred semantic annotations by using a joint syntacticsemantic parser that learns the correlations between syntax and semantics of the target language and smooths out the errors from automatic transfer. We reach a labelled F-measure for predicates and arguments of only 4% and 9% points, respectively, lower than the upper bound from manual annotations.</p><p>6 0.051516313 <a title="42-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Blast%3A_A_Tool_for_Error_Analysis_of_Machine_Translation_Output.html">62 acl-2011-Blast: A Tool for Error Analysis of Machine Translation Output</a></p>

As a result, our system reached 94. 17% micro-averaged and 79.76% macro-averaged F1-measures, and showed substantial recall gains on the minority classes. 1</p><p>3 0.59120011 <a title="42-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-MACAON_An_NLP_Tool_Suite_for_Processing_Word_Lattices.html">215 acl-2011-MACAON An NLP Tool Suite for Processing Word Lattices</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexis Nasr ; Frederic Bechet ; Jean-Francois Rey ; Benoit Favre ; Joseph Le Roux</p><p>Abstract: MACAON is a tool suite for standard NLP tasks developed for French. MACAON has been designed to process both human-produced text and highly ambiguous word-lattices produced by NLP tools. MACAON is made of several native modules for common tasks such as a tokenization, a part-of-speech tagging or syntactic parsing, all communicating with each other through XML files . In addition, exchange protocols with external tools are easily definable. MACAON is a fast, modular and open tool, distributed under GNU Public License.</p><p>4 0.56844717 <a title="42-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Lexically-Triggered_Hidden_Markov_Models_for_Clinical_Document_Coding.html">209 acl-2011-Lexically-Triggered Hidden Markov Models for Clinical Document Coding</a></p>
<p>Author: Svetlana Kiritchenko ; Colin Cherry</p><p>Abstract: The automatic coding of clinical documents is an important task for today’s healthcare providers. Though it can be viewed as multi-label document classification, the coding problem has the interesting property that most code assignments can be supported by a single phrase found in the input document. We propose a Lexically-Triggered Hidden Markov Model (LT-HMM) that leverages these phrases to improve coding accuracy. The LT-HMM works in two stages: first, a lexical match is performed against a term dictionary to collect a set of candidate codes for a document. Next, a discriminative HMM selects the best subset of codes to assign to the document by tagging candidates as present or absent. By confirming codes proposed by a dictionary, the LT-HMM can share features across codes, enabling strong performance even on rare codes. In fact, we are able to recover codes that do not occur in the training set at all. Our approach achieves the best ever performance on the 2007 Medical NLP Challenge test set, with an F-measure of 89.84.</p><p>5 0.53584373 <a title="42-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-ConsentCanvas%3A_Automatic_Texturing_for_Improved_Readability_in_End-User_License_Agreements.html">80 acl-2011-ConsentCanvas: Automatic Texturing for Improved Readability in End-User License Agreements</a></p>
<p>Author: Oliver Schneider ; Alex Garnett</p><p>Abstract: We present ConsentCanvas, a system which structures and “texturizes” End-User License Agreement (EULA) documents to be more readable. The system aims to help users better understand the terms under which they are providing their informed consent. ConsentCanvas receives unstructured text documents as input and uses unsupervised natural language processing methods to embellish the source document using a linked stylesheet. Unlike similar usable security projects which employ summarization techniques, our system preserves the contents of the source document, minimizing the cognitive and legal burden for both the end user and the licensor. Our system does not require a corpus for training. 1</p><p>6 0.50507098 <a title="42-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Piggyback%3A_Using_Search_Engines_for_Robust_Cross-Domain_Named_Entity_Recognition.html">246 acl-2011-Piggyback: Using Search Engines for Robust Cross-Domain Named Entity Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Balaji Soundrarajan ; Thomas Ginter ; Scott DuVall</p><p>Abstract: This demonstration presents the Annotation Librarian, an application programming interface that supports rapid development of natural language processing (NLP) projects built in Apache Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA). The flexibility of UIMA to support all types of unstructured data – images, audio, and text – increases the complexity of some of the most common NLP development tasks. The Annotation Librarian interface handles these common functions and allows the creation and management of annotations by mirroring Java methods used to manipulate Strings. The familiar syntax and NLP-centric design allows developers to adopt and rapidly develop NLP algorithms in UIMA. The general functionality of the interface is described in relation to the use cases that necessitated its creation. 1</p><p>2 0.53123277 <a title="42-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Bootstrapping_coreference_resolution_using_word_associations.html">63 acl-2011-Bootstrapping coreference resolution using word associations</a></p>
<p>Author: Hamidreza Kobdani ; Hinrich Schuetze ; Michael Schiehlen ; Hans Kamp</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an unsupervised framework that bootstraps a complete coreference resolution (CoRe) system from word associations mined from a large unlabeled corpus. We show that word associations are useful for CoRe – e.g., the strong association between Obama and President is an indicator of likely coreference. Association information has so far not been used in CoRe because it is sparse and difficult to learn from small labeled corpora. Since unlabeled text is readily available, our unsupervised approach addresses the sparseness problem. In a self-training framework, we train a decision tree on a corpus that is automatically labeled using word associations. We show that this unsupervised system has better CoRe performance than other learning approaches that do not use manually labeled data. .</p><p>3 0.50610894 <a title="42-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-A_Fast_and_Accurate_Method_for_Approximate_String_Search.html">11 acl-2011-A Fast and Accurate Method for Approximate String Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Ziqi Wang ; Gu Xu ; Hang Li ; Ming Zhang</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for approximate string search, specifically candidate generation in spelling error correction, which is a task as follows. Given a misspelled word, the system finds words in a dictionary, which are most “similar” to the misspelled word. The paper proposes a probabilistic approach to the task, which is both accurate and efficient. The approach includes the use of a log linear model, a method for training the model, and an algorithm for finding the top k candidates. The log linear model is defined as a conditional probability distribution of a corrected word and a rule set for the correction conditioned on the misspelled word. The learning method employs the criterion in candidate generation as loss function. The retrieval algorithm is efficient and is guaranteed to find the optimal k candidates. Experimental results on large scale data show that the proposed approach improves upon existing methods in terms of accuracy in different settings.</p><p>4 0.47896272 <a title="42-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Monolingual_Alignment_by_Edit_Rate_Computation_on_Sentential_Paraphrase_Pairs.html">225 acl-2011-Monolingual Alignment by Edit Rate Computation on Sentential Paraphrase Pairs</a></p>
<p>Author: Houda Bouamor ; Aurelien Max ; Anne Vilnat</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel way of tackling the monolingual alignment problem on pairs of sentential paraphrases by means of edit rate computation. In order to inform the edit rate, information in the form of subsentential paraphrases is provided by a range of techniques built for different purposes. We show that the tunable TER-PLUS metric from Machine Translation evaluation can achieve good performance on this task and that it can effectively exploit information coming from complementary sources.</p><p>5 0.44082481 <a title="42-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Fine-Grained_Class_Label_Markup_of_Search_Queries.html">137 acl-2011-Fine-Grained Class Label Markup of Search Queries</a></p>
<p>Author: Joseph Reisinger ; Marius Pasca</p><p>Abstract: We develop a novel approach to the semantic analysis of short text segments and demonstrate its utility on a large corpus of Web search queries. Extracting meaning from short text segments is difficult as there is little semantic redundancy between terms; hence methods based on shallow semantic analysis may fail to accurately estimate meaning. Furthermore search queries lack explicit syntax often used to determine intent in question answering. In this paper we propose a hybrid model of semantic analysis combining explicit class-label extraction with a latent class PCFG. This class-label correlation (CLC) model admits a robust parallel approximation, allowing it to scale to large amounts of query data. We demonstrate its performance in terms of (1) its predicted label accuracy on polysemous queries and (2) its ability to accurately chunk queries into base constituents.</p><p>6 0.40929323 <a title="42-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Good_Seed_Makes_a_Good_Crop%3A_Accelerating_Active_Learning_Using_Language_Modeling.html">145 acl-2011-Good Seed Makes a Good Crop: Accelerating Active Learning Using Language Modeling</a></p>

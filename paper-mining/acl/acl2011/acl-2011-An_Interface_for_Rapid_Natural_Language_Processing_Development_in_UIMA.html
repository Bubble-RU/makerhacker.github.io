<p>Author: Youngjun Kim ; Ellen Riloff ; Stephane Meystre</p><p>Abstract: We present an NLP system that classifies the assertion type of medical problems in clinical notes used for the Fourth i2b2/VA Challenge. Our classifier uses a variety of linguistic features, including lexical, syntactic, lexicosyntactic, and contextual features. To overcome an extremely unbalanced distribution of assertion types in the data set, we focused our efforts on adding features specifically to improve the performance of minority classes. As a result, our system reached 94. 17% micro-averaged and 79.76% macro-averaged F1-measures, and showed substantial recall gains on the minority classes. 1</p><p>3 0.063904107 <a title="42-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Lexically-Triggered_Hidden_Markov_Models_for_Clinical_Document_Coding.html">209 acl-2011-Lexically-Triggered Hidden Markov Models for Clinical Document Coding</a></p>
<p>Author: Svetlana Kiritchenko ; Colin Cherry</p><p>Abstract: The automatic coding of clinical documents is an important task for today’s healthcare providers. Though it can be viewed as multi-label document classification, the coding problem has the interesting property that most code assignments can be supported by a single phrase found in the input document. We propose a Lexically-Triggered Hidden Markov Model (LT-HMM) that leverages these phrases to improve coding accuracy. The LT-HMM works in two stages: first, a lexical match is performed against a term dictionary to collect a set of candidate codes for a document. Next, a discriminative HMM selects the best subset of codes to assign to the document by tagging candidates as present or absent. By confirming codes proposed by a dictionary, the LT-HMM can share features across codes, enabling strong performance even on rare codes. In fact, we are able to recover codes that do not occur in the training set at all. Our approach achieves the best ever performance on the 2007 Medical NLP Challenge test set, with an F-measure of 89.84.</p><p>4 0.062338918 <a title="42-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Towards_a_Framework_for_Abstractive_Summarization_of_Multimodal_Documents.html">308 acl-2011-Towards a Framework for Abstractive Summarization of Multimodal Documents</a></p>
<p>Author: Charles Greenbacker</p><p>Abstract: We propose a framework for generating an abstractive summary from a semantic model of a multimodal document. We discuss the type of model required, the means by which it can be constructed, how the content of the model is rated and selected, and the method of realizing novel sentences for the summary. To this end, we introduce a metric called information density used for gauging the importance of content obtained from text and graphical sources.</p><p>5 0.06158641 <a title="42-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Clairlib%3A_A_Toolkit_for_Natural_Language_Processing%2C_Information_Retrieval%2C_and_Network_Analysis.html">67 acl-2011-Clairlib: A Toolkit for Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Network Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present Clairlib, an opensource toolkit for Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Network Analysis. Clairlib provides an integrated framework intended to simplify a number of generic tasks within and across those three areas. It has a command-line interface, a graphical interface, and a documented API. Clairlib is compatible with all the common platforms and operating systems.

An Emerging text-intensive enterprise applications such as social analytics and semantic search pose new challenges of scalability and usability to Information Extraction (IE) systems. This paper presents SystemT, a declarative IE system that addresses these challenges and has been deployed in a wide range of enterprise applications. SystemT facilitates the development of high quality complex annotators by providing a highly expressive language and an advanced development environment. It also includes a cost-based optimizer and a high-performance, flexible runtime with minimum memory footprint. We present SystemT as a useful resource that is freely available, and as an opportunity to promote research in building scalable and usable IE systems.</p><p>3 0.68182713 <a title="42-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-ConsentCanvas%3A_Automatic_Texturing_for_Improved_Readability_in_End-User_License_Agreements.html">80 acl-2011-ConsentCanvas: Automatic Texturing for Improved Readability in End-User License Agreements</a></p>
<p>Author: Oliver Schneider ; Alex Garnett</p><p>Abstract: We present ConsentCanvas, a system which structures and “texturizes” End-User License Agreement (EULA) documents to be more readable. The system aims to help users better understand the terms under which they are providing their informed consent. ConsentCanvas receives unstructured text documents as input and uses unsupervised natural language processing methods to embellish the source document using a linked stylesheet. Unlike similar usable security projects which employ summarization techniques, our system preserves the contents of the source document, minimizing the cognitive and legal burden for both the end user and the licensor. Our system does not require a corpus for training. 1</p><p>4 0.65604448 <a title="42-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Exploiting_Readymades_in_Linguistic_Creativity%3A_A_System_Demonstration_of_the_Jigsaw_Bard.html">125 acl-2011-Exploiting Readymades in Linguistic Creativity: A System Demonstration of the Jigsaw Bard</a></p>
<p>Author: Tony Veale ; Yanfen Hao</p><p>Abstract: Large lexical resources, such as corpora and databases of Web ngrams, are a rich source of pre-fabricated phrases that can be reused in many different contexts. However, one must be careful in how these resources are used, and noted writers such as George Orwell have argued that the use of canned phrases encourages sloppy thinking and results in poor communication. Nonetheless, while Orwell prized home-made phrases over the readymade variety, there is a vibrant movement in modern art which shifts artistic creation from the production of novel artifacts to the clever reuse of readymades or objets trouvés. We describe here a system that makes creative reuse of the linguistic readymades in the Google ngrams. Our system, the Jigsaw Bard, thus owes more to Marcel Duchamp than to George Orwell. We demonstrate how textual readymades can be identified and harvested on a large scale, and used to drive a modest form of linguistic creativity. 1</p><p>5 0.61628366 <a title="42-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-A_Speech-based_Just-in-Time_Retrieval_System_using_Semantic_Search.html">26 acl-2011-A Speech-based Just-in-Time Retrieval System using Semantic Search</a></p>

The documents are found using keyword-based search or using a semantic similarity measure between documents and the words obtained from automatic speech recognition. Results are displayed in real time to meeting participants, or to users watching a recorded lecture or conversation.</p><p>6 0.58264089 <a title="42-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Clairlib%3A_A_Toolkit_for_Natural_Language_Processing%2C_Information_Retrieval%2C_and_Network_Analysis.html">67 acl-2011-Clairlib: A Toolkit for Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Network Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Omar F. Zaidan ; Chris Callison-Burch</p><p>Abstract: The written form of Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), differs quite a bit from the spoken dialects of Arabic, which are the true “native” languages of Arabic speakers used in daily life. However, due to MSA’s prevalence in written form, almost all Arabic datasets have predominantly MSA content. We present the Arabic Online Commentary Dataset, a 52M-word monolingual dataset rich in dialectal content, and we describe our long-term annotation effort to identify the dialect level (and dialect itself) in each sentence of the dataset. So far, we have labeled 108K sentences, 41% of which as having dialectal content. We also present experimental results on the task of automatic dialect identification, using the collected labels for training and evaluation.</p><p>3 0.69905502 <a title="42-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Classifying_arguments_by_scheme.html">68 acl-2011-Classifying arguments by scheme</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiaojun Wan</p><p>Abstract: Cross-language document summarization is defined as the task of producing a summary in a target language (e.g. Chinese) for a set of documents in a source language (e.g. English). Existing methods for addressing this task make use of either the information from the original documents in the source language or the information from the translated documents in the target language. In this study, we propose to use the bilingual information from both the source and translated documents for this task. Two summarization methods (SimFusion and CoRank) are proposed to leverage the bilingual information in the graph-based ranking framework for cross-language summary extraction. Experimental results on the DUC2001 dataset with manually translated reference Chinese summaries show the effectiveness of the proposed methods. 1</p><p>5 0.64644015 <a title="42-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Subjectivity_and_Sentiment_Analysis_of_Modern_Standard_Arabic.html">289 acl-2011-Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis of Modern Standard Arabic</a></p>
<p>Author: Muhammad Abdul-Mageed ; Mona Diab ; Mohammed Korayem</p><p>Abstract: Although Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis (SSA) has been witnessing a flurry of novel research, there are few attempts to build SSA systems for Morphologically-Rich Languages (MRL). In the current study, we report efforts to partially fill this gap. We present a newly developed manually annotated corpus ofModern Standard Arabic (MSA) together with a new polarity lexicon.The corpus is a collection of newswire documents annotated on the sentence level. We also describe an automatic SSA tagging system that exploits the annotated data. We investigate the impact of different levels ofpreprocessing settings on the SSA classification task. We show that by explicitly accounting for the rich morphology the system is able to achieve significantly higher levels of performance.</p><p>6 0.58310896 <a title="42-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Improving_Question_Recommendation_by_Exploiting_Information_Need.html">169 acl-2011-Improving Question Recommendation by Exploiting Information Need</a></p>

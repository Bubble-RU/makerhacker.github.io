<p>Author: Helen Yannakoudakis ; Ted Briscoe ; Ben Medlock</p><p>Abstract: We demonstrate how supervised discriminative machine learning techniques can be used to automate the assessment of ‘English as a Second or Other Language’ (ESOL) examination scripts. In particular, we use rank preference learning to explicitly model the grade relationships between scripts. A number of different features are extracted and ablation tests are used to investigate their contribution to overall performance. A comparison between regression and rank preference models further supports our method. Experimental results on the first publically available dataset show that our system can achieve levels of performance close to the upper bound for the task, as defined by the agreement between human examiners on the same corpus. Finally, using a set of ‘outlier’ texts, we test the validity of our model and identify cases where the model’s scores diverge from that of a human examiner.</p><p>3 0.079486087 <a title="55-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Using_Multiple_Sources_to_Construct_a_Sentiment_Sensitive_Thesaurus_for_Cross-Domain_Sentiment_Classification.html">332 acl-2011-Using Multiple Sources to Construct a Sentiment Sensitive Thesaurus for Cross-Domain Sentiment Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Danushka Bollegala ; David Weir ; John Carroll</p><p>Abstract: We describe a sentiment classification method that is applicable when we do not have any labeled data for a target domain but have some labeled data for multiple other domains, designated as the source domains. We automat- ically create a sentiment sensitive thesaurus using both labeled and unlabeled data from multiple source domains to find the association between words that express similar sentiments in different domains. The created thesaurus is then used to expand feature vectors to train a binary classifier. Unlike previous cross-domain sentiment classification methods, our method can efficiently learn from multiple source domains. Our method significantly outperforms numerous baselines and returns results that are better than or comparable to previous cross-domain sentiment classification methods on a benchmark dataset containing Amazon user reviews for different types of products.</p><p>4 0.076201104 <a title="55-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Aspect_Ranking%3A_Identifying_Important_Product_Aspects_from_Online_Consumer_Reviews.html">45 acl-2011-Aspect Ranking: Identifying Important Product Aspects from Online Consumer Reviews</a></p>
<p>Author: Jianxing Yu ; Zheng-Jun Zha ; Meng Wang ; Tat-Seng Chua</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we dedicate to the topic of aspect ranking, which aims to automatically identify important product aspects from online consumer reviews. The important aspects are identified according to two observations: (a) the important aspects of a product are usually commented by a large number of consumers; and (b) consumers’ opinions on the important aspects greatly influence their overall opinions on the product. In particular, given consumer reviews of a product, we first identify the product aspects by a shallow dependency parser and determine consumers’ opinions on these aspects via a sentiment classifier. We then develop an aspect ranking algorithm to identify the important aspects by simultaneously considering the aspect frequency and the influence of consumers’ opinions given to each aspect on their overall opinions. The experimental results on 11 popular products in four domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We further apply the aspect ranking results to the application ofdocumentlevel sentiment classification, and improve the performance significantly.</p><p>5 0.072406441 <a title="55-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Learning_to_Grade_Short_Answer_Questions_using_Semantic_Similarity_Measures_and_Dependency_Graph_Alignments.html">205 acl-2011-Learning to Grade Short Answer Questions using Semantic Similarity Measures and Dependency Graph Alignments</a></p>

We combine several graph alignment features with lexical semantic similarity measures using machine learning techniques and show that the student answers can be more accurately graded than if the semantic measures were used in isolation. We also present a first attempt to align the dependency graphs of the student and the instructor answers in order to make use of a structural component in the automatic grading of student answers.</p><p>6 0.061263047 <a title="55-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Learning_Word_Vectors_for_Sentiment_Analysis.html">204 acl-2011-Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Kirill Kireyev ; Thomas K Landauer</p><p>Abstract: While computational estimation of difficulty of words in the lexicon is useful in many educational and assessment applications, the concept of scalar word difficulty and current corpus-based methods for its estimation are inadequate. We propose a new paradigm called word meaning maturity which tracks the degree of knowledge of each word at different stages of language learning. We present a computational algorithm for estimating word maturity, based on modeling language acquisition with Latent Semantic Analysis. We demonstrate that the resulting metric not only correlates well with external indicators, but captures deeper semantic effects in language. 1 Motivation It is no surprise that through stages of language learning, different words are learned at different times and are known to different extents. For example, a common word like “dog” is familiar to even a first-grader, whereas a more advanced word like “focal” does not usually enter learners’ vocabulary until much later. Although individual rates of learning words may vary between highand low-performing students, it has been observed that “children [… ] acquire word meanings in roughly the same sequence” (Biemiller, 2008). The aim of this work is to model the degree of knowledge of words at different learning stages. Such a metric would have extremely useful applications in personalized educational technologies, for the purposes of accurate assessment and personalized vocabulary instruction. … 299 .l andaue r } @pear s on .com 2 Rethinking Word Difficulty Previously, related work in education and psychometrics has been concerned with measuring word difficulty or classifying words into different difficulty categories. Examples of such approaches include creation of word lists for targeted vocabulary instruction at various grade levels that were compiled by educational experts, such as Nation (1993) or Biemiller (2008). Such word difficulty assignments are also implicitly present in some readability formulas that estimate difficulty of texts, such as Lexiles (Stenner, 1996), which include a lexical difficulty component based on the frequency of occurrence of words in a representative corpus, on the assumption that word difficulty is inversely correlated to corpus frequency. Additionally, research in psycholinguistics has attempted to outline and measure psycholinguistic dimensions of words such as age-of-acquisition and familiarity, which aim to track when certain words become known and how familiar they appear to an average person. Importantly, all such word difficulty measures can be thought of as functions that assign a single scalar value to each word w: !</p><p>4 0.70782775 <a title="55-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Discovering_Sociolinguistic_Associations_with_Structured_Sparsity.html">97 acl-2011-Discovering Sociolinguistic Associations with Structured Sparsity</a></p>
<p>Author: Jacob Eisenstein ; Noah A. Smith ; Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to discover robust and interpretable sociolinguistic associations from raw geotagged text data. Using aggregate demographic statistics about the authors’ geographic communities, we solve a multi-output regression problem between demographics and lexical frequencies. By imposing a composite ‘1,∞ regularizer, we obtain structured sparsity, driving entire rows of coefficients to zero. We perform two regression studies. First, we use term frequencies to predict demographic attributes; our method identifies a compact set of words that are strongly associated with author demographics. Next, we conjoin demographic attributes into features, which we use to predict term frequencies. The composite regularizer identifies a small number of features, which correspond to communities of authors united by shared demographic and linguistic properties.</p><p>5 0.70510525 <a title="55-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Computing_and_Evaluating_Syntactic_Complexity_Features_for_Automated_Scoring_of_Spontaneous_Non-Native_Speech.html">77 acl-2011-Computing and Evaluating Syntactic Complexity Features for Automated Scoring of Spontaneous Non-Native Speech</a></p>
<p>Author: Miao Chen ; Klaus Zechner</p><p>Abstract: This paper focuses on identifying, extracting and evaluating features related to syntactic complexity of spontaneous spoken responses as part of an effort to expand the current feature set of an automated speech scoring system in order to cover additional aspects considered important in the construct of communicative competence. Our goal is to find effective features, selected from a large set of features proposed previously and some new features designed in analogous ways from a syntactic complexity perspective that correlate well with human ratings of the same spoken responses, and to build automatic scoring models based on the most promising features by using machine learning methods. On human transcriptions with manually annotated clause and sentence boundaries, our best scoring model achieves an overall Pearson correlation with human rater scores of r=0.49 on an unseen test set, whereas correlations of models using sentence or clause boundaries from automated classifiers are around r=0.2. 1</p><p>6 0.68117541 <a title="55-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Discrete_vs._Continuous_Rating_Scales_for_Language_Evaluation_in_NLP.html">99 acl-2011-Discrete vs. Continuous Rating Scales for Language Evaluation in NLP</a></p>

<p>Author: Mohit Bansal ; Chris Quirk ; Robert Moore</p><p>Abstract: We propose a principled and efficient phraseto-phrase alignment model, useful in machine translation as well as other related natural language processing problems. In a hidden semiMarkov model, word-to-phrase and phraseto-word translations are modeled directly by the system. Agreement between two directional models encourages the selection of parsimonious phrasal alignments, avoiding the overfitting commonly encountered in unsupervised training with multi-word units. Expanding the state space to include “gappy phrases” (such as French ne ? pas) makes the alignment space more symmetric; thus, it allows agreement between discontinuous alignments. The resulting system shows substantial improvements in both alignment quality and translation quality over word-based Hidden Markov Models, while maintaining asymptotically equivalent runtime.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.72843677 <a title="55-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Automatically_Predicting_Peer-Review_Helpfulness.html">55 acl-2011-Automatically Predicting Peer-Review Helpfulness</a></p>

<p>Author: Patrick Pantel ; Ariel Fuxman</p><p>Abstract: We propose methods for estimating the probability that an entity from an entity database is associated with a web search query. Association is modeled using a query entity click graph, blending general query click logs with vertical query click logs. Smoothing techniques are proposed to address the inherent data sparsity in such graphs, including interpolation using a query synonymy model. A large-scale empirical analysis of the smoothing techniques, over a 2-year click graph collected from a commercial search engine, shows significant reductions in modeling error. The association models are then applied to the task of recommending products to web queries, by annotating queries with products from a large catalog and then mining query- product associations through web search session analysis. Experimental analysis shows that our smoothing techniques improve coverage while keeping precision stable, and overall, that our top-performing model affects 9% of general web queries with 94% precision.</p><p>4 0.67135918 <a title="55-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-A_Corpus_of_Scope-disambiguated_English_Text.html">8 acl-2011-A Corpus of Scope-disambiguated English Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Mehdi Manshadi ; James Allen ; Mary Swift</p><p>Abstract: Previous work on quantifier scope annotation focuses on scoping sentences with only two quantified noun phrases (NPs), where the quantifiers are restricted to a predefined list. It also ignores negation, modal/logical operators, and other sentential adverbials. We present a comprehensive scope annotation scheme. We annotate the scope interaction between all scopal terms in the sentence from quantifiers to scopal adverbials, without putting any restriction on the number of scopal terms in a sentence. In addition, all NPs, explicitly quantified or not, with no restriction on the type of quantification, are investigated for possible scope interactions. 1</p><p>5 0.65946341 <a title="55-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-A_Generative_Entity-Mention_Model_for_Linking_Entities_with_Knowledge_Base.html">12 acl-2011-A Generative Entity-Mention Model for Linking Entities with Knowledge Base</a></p>
<p>Author: Xianpei Han ; Le Sun</p><p>Abstract: Linking entities with knowledge base (entity linking) is a key issue in bridging the textual data with the structural knowledge base. Due to the name variation problem and the name ambiguity problem, the entity linking decisions are critically depending on the heterogenous knowledge of entities. In this paper, we propose a generative probabilistic model, called entitymention model, which can leverage heterogenous entity knowledge (including popularity knowledge, name knowledge and context knowledge) for the entity linking task. In our model, each name mention to be linked is modeled as a sample generated through a three-step generative story, and the entity knowledge is encoded in the distribution of entities in document P(e), the distribution of possible names of a specific entity P(s|e), and the distribution of possible contexts of a specific entity P(c|e). To find the referent entity of a name mention, our method combines the evidences from all the three distributions P(e), P(s|e) and P(c|e). Experimental results show that our method can significantly outperform the traditional methods. 1</p><p>6 0.64045876 <a title="55-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-An_Unsupervised_Model_for_Joint_Phrase_Alignment_and_Extraction.html">43 acl-2011-An Unsupervised Model for Joint Phrase Alignment and Extraction</a></p>

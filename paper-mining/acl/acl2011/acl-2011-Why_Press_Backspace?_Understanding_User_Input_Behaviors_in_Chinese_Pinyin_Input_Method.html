<p>Author: Maoxi Li ; Chengqing Zong ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: Word is usually adopted as the smallest unit in most tasks of Chinese language processing. However, for automatic evaluation of the quality of Chinese translation output when translating from other languages, either a word-level approach or a character-level approach is possible. So far, there has been no detailed study to compare the correlations of these two approaches with human assessment. In this paper, we compare word-level metrics with characterlevel metrics on the submitted output of English-to-Chinese translation systems in the IWSLT’08 CT-EC and NIST’08 EC tasks. Our experimental results reveal that character-level metrics correlate with human assessment better than word-level metrics. Our analysis suggests several key reasons behind this finding. 1</p><p>3 0.14650583 <a title="336-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Using_Bilingual_Information_for_Cross-Language_Document_Summarization.html">326 acl-2011-Using Bilingual Information for Cross-Language Document Summarization</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaojun Wan</p><p>Abstract: Cross-language document summarization is defined as the task of producing a summary in a target language (e.g. Chinese) for a set of documents in a source language (e.g. English). Existing methods for addressing this task make use of either the information from the original documents in the source language or the information from the translated documents in the target language. In this study, we propose to use the bilingual information from both the source and translated documents for this task. Two summarization methods (SimFusion and CoRank) are proposed to leverage the bilingual information in the graph-based ranking framework for cross-language summary extraction. Experimental results on the DUC2001 dataset with manually translated reference Chinese summaries show the effectiveness of the proposed methods. 1</p><p>4 0.13381822 <a title="336-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Parsing_the_Internal_Structure_of_Words%3A_A_New_Paradigm_for_Chinese_Word_Segmentation.html">241 acl-2011-Parsing the Internal Structure of Words: A New Paradigm for Chinese Word Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongguo Li</p><p>Abstract: Lots of Chinese characters are very productive in that they can form many structured words either as prefixes or as suffixes. Previous research in Chinese word segmentation mainly focused on identifying only the word boundaries without considering the rich internal structures of many words. In this paper we argue that this is unsatisfying in many ways, both practically and theoretically. Instead, we propose that word structures should be recovered in morphological analysis. An elegant approach for doing this is given and the result is shown to be promising enough for encouraging further effort in this direction. Our probability model is trained with the Penn Chinese Treebank and actually is able to parse both word and phrase structures in a unified way. 1 Why Parse Word Structures? Research in Chinese word segmentation has progressed tremendously in recent years, with state of the art performing at around 97% in precision and recall (Xue, 2003; Gao et al., 2005; Zhang and Clark, 2007; Li and Sun, 2009). However, virtually all these systems focus exclusively on recognizing the word boundaries, giving no consideration to the internal structures of many words. Though it has been the standard practice for many years, we argue that this paradigm is inadequate both in theory and in practice, for at least the following four reasons. The first reason is that if we confine our definition of word segmentation to the identification of word boundaries, then people tend to have divergent 1405 opinions as to whether a linguistic unit is a word or not (Sproat et al., 1996). This has led to many different annotation standards for Chinese word segmentation. Even worse, this could cause inconsistency in the same corpus. For instance, 䉂 擌 奒 ‘vice president’ is considered to be one word in the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005), but is split into two words by the Peking University corpus in the SIGHAN Bakeoffs (Sproat and Emerson, 2003). Meanwhile, 䉂 䀓 惼 ‘vice director’ and 䉂 䚲䡮 ‘deputy are both segmented into two words in the same Penn Chinese Treebank. In fact, all these words are composed of the prefix 䉂 ‘vice’ and a root word. Thus the structure of 䉂擌奒 ‘vice president’ can be represented with the tree in Figure 1. Without a doubt, there is complete agree- manager’ NN ,,ll JJf NNf 䉂 擌奒 Figure 1: Example of a word with internal structure. ment on the correctness of this structure among native Chinese speakers. So if instead of annotating only word boundaries, we annotate the structures of every word, then the annotation tends to be more 1 1Here it is necessary to add a note on terminology used in this paper. Since there is no universally accepted definition of the “word” concept in linguistics and especially in Chinese, whenever we use the term “word” we might mean a linguistic unit such as 䉂 擌奒 ‘vice president’ whose structure is shown as the tree in Figure 1, or we might mean a smaller unit such as 擌奒 ‘president’ which is a substructure of that tree. Hopefully, ProceedingPso orftla thned 4,9 Otrhe Agonnn,u Jauln Mee 1e9t-i2ng4, o 2f0 t1h1e.

The second reason is applications have different requirements for granularity of words. Take the personal name 撱 嗤吼 ‘Zhou Shuren’ as an example. It’s considered to be one word in the Penn Chinese Treebank, but is segmented into a surname and a given name in the Peking University corpus. For some applications such as information extraction, the former segmentation is adequate, while for others like machine translation, the later finer-grained output is more preferable. If the analyzer can produce a structure as shown in Figure 4(a), then every application can extract what it needs from this tree. A solution with tree output like this is more elegant than approaches which try to meet the needs of different applications in post-processing (Gao et al., 2004). The third reason is that traditional word segmentation has problems in handling many phenomena in Chinese. For example, the telescopic compound 㦌 撥 怂惆 ‘universities, middle schools and primary schools’ is in fact composed ofthree coordinating elements 㦌惆 ‘university’, 撥 惆 ‘middle school’ and 怂惆 ‘primary school’ . Regarding it as one flat word loses this important information. Another example is separable words like 扩 扙 ‘swim’ . With a linear segmentation, the meaning of ‘swimming’ as in 扩 堑 扙 ‘after swimming’ cannot be properly represented, since 扩扙 ‘swim’ will be segmented into discontinuous units. These language usages lie at the boundary between syntax and morphology, and are not uncommon in Chinese. They can be adequately represented with trees (Figure 2).

The last reason why we should care about word the context will always make it clear what is being referred to with the term “word”. 1406 structures is related to head driven statistical parsers (Collins, 2003). To illustrate this, note that in the Penn Chinese Treebank, the word 戽 䊂䠽 吼 ‘English People’ does not occur at all. Hence constituents headed by such words could cause some difficulty for head driven models in which out-ofvocabulary words need to be treated specially both when they are generated and when they are conditioned upon. But this word is in turn headed by its suffix 吼 ‘people’, and there are 2,233 such words in Penn Chinese Treebank. If we annotate the structure of every compound containing this suffix (e.g. Figure 3), such data sparsity simply goes away.</p><p>5 0.10196927 <a title="336-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Joint_Bilingual_Sentiment_Classification_with_Unlabeled_Parallel_Corpora.html">183 acl-2011-Joint Bilingual Sentiment Classification with Unlabeled Parallel Corpora</a></p>
<p>Author: Bin Lu ; Chenhao Tan ; Claire Cardie ; Benjamin K. Tsou</p><p>Abstract: Most previous work on multilingual sentiment analysis has focused on methods to adapt sentiment resources from resource-rich languages to resource-poor languages. We present a novel approach for joint bilingual sentiment classification at the sentence level that augments available labeled data in each language with unlabeled parallel data. We rely on the intuition that the sentiment labels for parallel sentences should be similar and present a model that jointly learns improved monolingual sentiment classifiers for each language. Experiments on multiple data sets show that the proposed approach (1) outperforms the monolingual baselines, significantly improving the accuracy for both languages by 3.44%-8. 12%; (2) outperforms two standard approaches for leveraging unlabeled data; and (3) produces (albeit smaller) performance gains when employing pseudo-parallel data from machine translation engines. 1</p><p>6 0.097093351 <a title="336-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-A_Fast_and_Accurate_Method_for_Approximate_String_Search.html">11 acl-2011-A Fast and Accurate Method for Approximate String Search</a></p>

So far, there has been no detailed study to compare the correlations of these two approaches with human assessment. In this paper, we compare word-level metrics with characterlevel metrics on the submitted output of English-to-Chinese translation systems in the IWSLT’08 CT-EC and NIST’08 EC tasks. Our experimental results reveal that character-level metrics correlate with human assessment better than word-level metrics. Our analysis suggests several key reasons behind this finding. 1</p><p>6 0.4627142 <a title="336-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Language-Independent_Parsing_with_Empty_Elements.html">192 acl-2011-Language-Independent Parsing with Empty Elements</a></p>

<p>Author: Bo Pang ; Ravi Kumar</p><p>Abstract: Web search is an information-seeking activity. Often times, this amounts to a user seeking answers to a question. However, queries, which encode user’s information need, are typically not expressed as full-length natural language sentences in particular, as questions. Rather, they consist of one or more text fragments. As humans become more searchengine-savvy, do natural-language questions still have a role to play in web search? Through a systematic, large-scale study, we find to our surprise that as time goes by, web users are more likely to use questions to express their search intent. —</p><p>same-paper 2 0.68103451 <a title="336-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Why_Press_Backspace%3F_Understanding_User_Input_Behaviors_in_Chinese_Pinyin_Input_Method.html">336 acl-2011-Why Press Backspace? Understanding User Input Behaviors in Chinese Pinyin Input Method</a></p>
<p>Author: Yabin Zheng ; Lixing Xie ; Zhiyuan Liu ; Maosong Sun ; Yang Zhang ; Liyun Ru</p><p>Abstract: Chinese Pinyin input method is very important for Chinese language information processing. Users may make errors when they are typing in Chinese words. In this paper, we are concerned with the reasons that cause the errors. Inspired by the observation that pressing backspace is one of the most common user behaviors to modify the errors, we collect 54, 309, 334 error-correction pairs from a realworld data set that contains 2, 277, 786 users via backspace operations. In addition, we present a comparative analysis of the data to achieve a better understanding of users’ input behaviors. Comparisons with English typos suggest that some language-specific properties result in a part of Chinese input errors. 1</p><p>3 0.62047249 <a title="336-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Faster_and_Smaller_N-Gram_Language_Models.html">135 acl-2011-Faster and Smaller N-Gram Language Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Adam Pauls ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: N-gram language models are a major resource bottleneck in machine translation. In this paper, we present several language model implementations that are both highly compact and fast to query. Our fastest implementation is as fast as the widely used SRILM while requiring only 25% of the storage. Our most compact representation can store all 4 billion n-grams and associated counts for the Google n-gram corpus in 23 bits per n-gram, the most compact lossless representation to date, and even more compact than recent lossy compression techniques. We also discuss techniques for improving query speed during decoding, including a simple but novel language model caching technique that improves the query speed of our language models (and SRILM) by up to 300%.</p><p>4 0.61255193 <a title="336-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Clustering_Comparable_Corpora_For_Bilingual_Lexicon_Extraction.html">70 acl-2011-Clustering Comparable Corpora For Bilingual Lexicon Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Bo Li ; Eric Gaussier ; Akiko Aizawa</p><p>Abstract: We study in this paper the problem of enhancing the comparability of bilingual corpora in order to improve the quality of bilingual lexicons extracted from comparable corpora. We introduce a clustering-based approach for enhancing corpus comparability which exploits the homogeneity feature of the corpus, and finally preserves most of the vocabulary of the original corpus. Our experiments illustrate the well-foundedness of this method and show that the bilingual lexicons obtained from the homogeneous corpus are of better quality than the lexicons obtained with previous approaches.</p><p>5 0.51628786 <a title="336-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Learning_Dependency-Based_Compositional_Semantics.html">200 acl-2011-Learning Dependency-Based Compositional Semantics</a></p>
<p>Author: Percy Liang ; Michael Jordan ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Compositional question answering begins by mapping questions to logical forms, but training a semantic parser to perform this mapping typically requires the costly annotation of the target logical forms. In this paper, we learn to map questions to answers via latent logical forms, which are induced automatically from question-answer pairs. In tackling this challenging learning problem, we introduce a new semantic representation which highlights a parallel between dependency syntax and efficient evaluation of logical forms. On two standard semantic parsing benchmarks (GEO and JOBS), our system obtains the highest published accuracies, despite requiring no annotated logical forms.</p><p>6 0.50484723 <a title="336-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Predicting_Relative_Prominence_in_Noun-Noun_Compounds.html">249 acl-2011-Predicting Relative Prominence in Noun-Noun Compounds</a></p>

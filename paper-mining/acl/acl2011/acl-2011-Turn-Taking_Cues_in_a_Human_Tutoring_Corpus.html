</p><p>2 This research analyzes a humanhuman tutoring corpus in order to identify prosodic turn-taking cues, with the hopes that they can be used by intelligent tutoring systems to predict student turn boundaries. [sent-4, score-1.118]
</p><p>3 Results show that while there was variation between subjects, three features were significant turn-yielding cues overall. [sent-5, score-0.452]
</p><p>4 In addition, a positive relationship between the number of cues present and the probability of a turn yield was demonstrated. [sent-6, score-0.67]
</p><p>5 1  Introduction  Human conversation is a seemingly simple, everyday phenomenon that requires a complex mental  process of turn-taking, in which participants manage to yield and hold the floor with little pause inbetween speaking turns. [sent-7, score-0.407]
</p><p>6 Most linguists subscribe to the idea that this process is governed by a subconscious internal mechanism, that is, a set of cues or rules that steers humans toward proper turntaking (Duncan, 1972). [sent-8, score-0.418]
</p><p>7 These cues may include lexical features such as the words used to end the turn, or prosodic features such as speaking rate, pitch, and intensity (Cutler and Pearson, 1986). [sent-9, score-0.665]
</p><p>8 While successful turn-taking is fairly easy for humans to accomplish, it is still difficult for models to be implemented in spoken dialogue systems. [sent-10, score-0.355]
</p><p>9 Many systems use a set time-out to decide 94 when a user is finished speaking, often resulting in unnaturally long pauses or awkward overlaps (Ward, et. [sent-11, score-0.029]
</p><p>10 Others detect when a user interrupts the system, known as “barge-in”, though this is characteristic of failed turn-taking rather than successful conversation (Glass, 1999). [sent-14, score-0.08]
</p><p>11 Improper turn-taking can often be a source of user discomfort and dissatisfaction with a spoken dialogue system. [sent-15, score-0.362]
</p><p>12 Little work has been done to study turn-taking in tutoring, so we hope to investigate it further while using a human-human (HH)  tutoring corpus and language technologies to extract useful information about turn-taking cues. [sent-16, score-0.347]
</p><p>13 This analysis is particularly interesting in a tutoring domain because of the speculated unequal statuses of participants. [sent-17, score-0.359]
</p><p>14 The goal is to eventually develop a model for turn-taking based on this analysis which can be implemented in an existent tutoring system, ITSPOKE, an intelligent tutor for college-level Newtonian physics (Litman and Silliman, 2004). [sent-18, score-0.621]
</p><p>15 ITSPOKE currently uses a time-out to determine the end of a student turn and does not recognize student barge-in. [sent-19, score-0.422]
</p><p>16 We hypothesize that improving upon the turn-taking model this system uses will help engage students and hopefully lead to increased student learning, a standard performance measure of intelligent tutoring systems (Litman et. [sent-20, score-0.614]
</p><p>17 2  Related Work  Turn-taking has been a recent focus in spoken dialogue system work, with research producing many different models and approaches. [sent-23, score-0.333]

</p><p>19 Selfridge and Heeman (2010) took a different approach and presented a bidding model for turn-taking, in which dialogue participants compete for the turn based on the importance of what they will say next. [sent-27, score-0.372]
</p><p>20 Of considerable inspiration to the research in this paper was Gravano and Hirschberg’s (2009) analysis of their games corpus, which showed that it was possible for turn-yielding cues to be identified in an HH corpus. [sent-28, score-0.433]
</p><p>21 Since our work is similar to that done by Gravano and Hirschberg (2009), we hypothesize that turn-yielding cues can also be identified in our HH tutoring corpus. [sent-31, score-0.773]
</p><p>22 However, it is possible that the cues identified will be very different, due to factors specific to a tutoring environment. [sent-32, score-0.719]
</p><p>23 These include, but are not limited to, status differences between the student and tutor, engagement of the student,  and the different goals of the student and tutor. [sent-33, score-0.308]
</p><p>24 Our hypothesis is that for certain prosodic features, there will be a significant difference between places where students yield their turn (allow the tutor to speak) and places where they hold it (continue talking). [sent-34, score-0.97]
</p><p>25 This would designate these features as turn-taking cues, and would allow them to be used as features in a turn-taking model for a spoken dialogue system in the future. [sent-35, score-0.377]
</p><p>26 3  Method  The data for this analysis is from an HH tutoring corpus recorded during the 2002-2003 school year. [sent-36, score-0.315]
</p><p>27 This is an audio corpus of 17 university students, all native Standard English speakers, working with a tutor (the same for all subjects) on physics problems (Litman et. [sent-37, score-0.245]
</p><p>28 Both the student and the tutor were sitting in front of separate work stations, so they could communicate only through microphones or, in the case of a studentwritten essay, through the shared computer environment. [sent-40, score-0.366]
</p><p>29 Any potential turn-taking cues that the tutor received from the student were very compa95  rable to what a spoken dialogue system would have to analyze during a user interaction. [sent-41, score-1.08]
</p><p>30 For each participant, student speech was isolated and segmented into breath groups. [sent-42, score-0.745]
</p><p>31 A breath group is defined as any segment of speech by one dialogue participant bounded by 200 ms of silence or more based on a certain threshold of intensity (Liscombe et. [sent-43, score-1.097]
</p><p>32 This break-down allowed for feature measurement and comparison at places that were and were not turn boundaries. [sent-46, score-0.175]
</p><p>33 Although Gravano and Hirschberg (2009) segmented their corpus by 50 ms of silence, we used 200 ms to divide the breath groups, as this data had already been calculated for another experiment done with the HH corpus (Liscombe et. [sent-47, score-0.679]
</p><p>34 Figure 1 is a diagram of a hypothetical conversation between two participants, with examples of HOLD’s and YIELD’s labeled. [sent-52, score-0.051]
</p><p>35 These groups were determined strictly by time and not by the actually speech being spoken. [sent-53, score-0.095]
</p><p>36 Speech acts such as backchannels, then, would be included in the YIELD group if they were spoken during clear gaps in the tutor’s speech, but would be placed in the OVERLAP group if they occurred during or overlapping with tutor speech. [sent-54, score-0.494]
</p><p>37 Four prosodic features were calculated for each breath group: duration, pitch, RMS, and percent silence. [sent-56, score-0.736]
</p><p>38 Duration is the length of the breath group in seconds. [sent-57, score-0.589]
</p><p>39 Pitch is the mean fundamental frequency (f0) of the speech. [sent-58, score-0.066]
</p><p>40 RMS (the root mean 1 Many thanks to the researchers at Columbia University for providing the breath group data for this corpus. [sent-59, score-0.655]

</p><p>42 S50 1 * denotes a significant p value  squared amplitude) is the energy or loudness. [sent-74, score-0.076]
</p><p>43 Percent silence was the amount of internal silence within the breath group. [sent-75, score-0.74]
</p><p>44 For pitch and RMS, the mean was taken over the length of the breath group. [sent-76, score-0.708]
</p><p>45 These features were used because they are similar to those used by Gravano and Hirschberg (2009), and are already used in the spoken dialogue system we will be using (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011). [sent-77, score-0.355]
</p><p>46 While only a small set of features is examined here, future work will include expanding the feature set. [sent-78, score-0.022]
</p><p>47 Mean values for each feature for HOLD’s and YIELD’s were calculated and compared using the student T-test in SPSS Statistics software. [sent-79, score-0.177]
</p><p>48 Two separate tests were done, one to compare the means for each student individually, and one to compare the means across all students. [sent-80, score-0.154]
</p><p>49 The p-values given are the probability of obtaining the  difference between groups by chance. [sent-83, score-0.044]
</p><p>50 These individual results indicated that while turn-taking cues could be identified, there was much variation between students. [sent-86, score-0.398]
</p><p>51 Table 1 displays the results of the analysis for one subject, student 111. [sent-87, score-0.154]
</p><p>52 For this student, all four prosodic features are turn-taking cues, as there is a significant different between the HOLD and YIELD groups for all of them. [sent-88, score-0.255]
</p><p>53 As shown in Table 3, mul96 tiple significant cues could be identified for most students, and there was only one which appeared to have no significant turn-yielding cues. [sent-90, score-0.49]
</p><p>54 In this analysis, duration, pitch, and RMS were all found to be significant cues. [sent-92, score-0.032]
</p><p>55 A more detailed look at each of the three significant cues is done below. [sent-95, score-0.438]
</p><p>56 oCNfu esmberofStuNdeSuntm sd9601 bwe nirthsof Significant Cues  Duration: The mean duration for HOLD’s is longer than the mean duration for YIELD’s. [sent-97, score-0.304]
</p><p>57 This suggests that students speak for a longer uninterrupted time when they are trying to hold their turn, and yield their turns with shorter utterances. [sent-98, score-0.386]
</p><p>58 Pitch: The mean pitch for YIELD’s is higher than the mean pitch for HOLD’s. [sent-100, score-0.42]
</p><p>59 During tutoring, students are possibly more uncertain, which may raise the mean pitch of the YIELD breath groups. [sent-103, score-0.79]
</p><p>60 RMS: The mean RMS, or energy, for HOLD’s is higher than the mean energy for YIELD’s. [sent-104, score-0.176]
</p><p>61 This is consistent with student’s speaking more softly, i. [sent-105, score-0.058]
</p><p>62 This is consistent with the results from the Columbia games corpus (Gravano and Hirshberg, 2009). [sent-108, score-0.029]
</p><p>63 2 Combining Cues Gravano and Hirschberg (2009) were able to show using their cues and corpus that there is a positive relationship between the number of turn-yielding cues present and the probability of a turn actually being taken. [sent-110, score-0.891]
</p><p>64 This suggests that in order to make sure that the other participant is aware whether the turn is going to continue or end, the speaker may subconsciously give them more information through multiple cues. [sent-111, score-0.185]
</p><p>65 To see whether this relationship existed in our data, each breath group was marked with a binary value for each significant cue, representing whether the cue was present or not present within that breath group. [sent-112, score-1.188]
</p><p>66 A cue was considered present if the  value for that breath group was strictly closer to the student’s mean for YIELD’s than HOLD’s. [sent-113, score-0.718]
</p><p>67 The number of cues present for each breath group was totaled. [sent-114, score-0.963]
</p><p>68 Only the three cues found to be significant cues were used for these calculations. [sent-115, score-0.78]
</p><p>69 For each number of cues possible x (0 to 3, inclusively), the probability of the turn being taken was calculated by p(x) = Y / T, where Y is the number of YIELD’s with x cues present, and T is the total number of breath groups with x cues present. [sent-116, score-1.801]
</p><p>70 Probability of YIELD According to these results, a positive relationship seems to exist for these cues and this corpus. [sent-120, score-0.403]
</p><p>71 The number of cues present and probability of a turn yield is strongly correlated (r = . [sent-122, score-0.641]
</p><p>72 A regression analysis done using SPSS showed that the adjusted r2 = . [sent-125, score-0.032]
</p><p>73 When no turn-yielding cues are present, there is still a majority chance that the student will yield their turn; however, this is understandable due to the small number of cues being analyzed. [sent-128, score-1.055]
</p><p>74 Regardless, this gives a very preliminary support for the idea that it is possible to predict when a turn will be taken based on the number of cues present. [sent-129, score-0.488]
</p><p>75 5  Conclusions  This paper presented preliminary work in using an HH tutoring corpus to construct a turn-taking model that can later be implemented in a spoken dialogue system. [sent-130, score-0.67]
</p><p>76 A small set of prosodic features was used to try and identify turn-taking cues by comparing their values at places where students yielded their turn to the tutor and places where they held it. [sent-131, score-1.061]
</p><p>77 Results show that turn-taking cues such as those investigated can be identified for the corpus, and may hold predictive ability for turn boundaries. [sent-132, score-0.638]
</p><p>78 While this work uncovers some interesting results in the tutoring domain, there are some shortcomings in the method that may make it difficult to effectively evaluate the results. [sent-135, score-0.315]
</p><p>79 As the breath group is different from the segment used in Gravano and Hirschberg’s (2009) experiment, and the set of prosodic features is smaller, direct comparison becomes quite difficult. [sent-136, score-0.768]
</p><p>80 The differences between the two methods provide enough doubt for the results to truly be interpreted as contradictory. [sent-137, score-0.029]
</p><p>81 Thus the first line of future inquiry is to redo this method using a smaller silence boundary (50 ms) and different set of prosodic features so that it is truly comparable to Gravano and Hirschberg’s (2009) work with the game corpus. [sent-138, score-0.329]
</p><p>82 This could yield interesting discoveries in the differences between the two corpora, shedding light on phenomena that are particular to tutoring scenarios. [sent-139, score-0.49]
</p><p>83 Perhaps direct comparison is not entirely necessary, and instead this work should be considered an isolated look at an HH corpus that provides insight into turn-taking, specifically in tutoring and other domains with unequal power levels. [sent-144, score-0.388]
</p><p>84 Future work in this direction would include growing the set of features by adding more prosodic ones and introducing lexical ones such as bi-grams and uni-grams. [sent-145, score-0.179]
</p><p>85 Already, work has been done to investigate the features used in the INTERSPEECH 2009 Emotion Challenge using openSMILE (Eyben et. [sent-146, score-0.054]
</p><p>86 When a large feature bank has been developed, significant cues will be used in conjunction with machine learning techniques to build a model for turntaking which can be implemented in a spoken dialogue tutoring system. [sent-149, score-1.12]
</p><p>87 The goal would be to learn more about human turn-taking while seeing if better turn-taking by a computer tutor ultimately leads to increased student learning in an intelligent tutoring system. [sent-150, score-0.7]

Although the importance of emotion in human dialogue is widely recognized, most dialogue act classification models make limited or no use of affective channels in dialogue act classification. This paper presents a novel affect-enriched dialogue act classifier for task-oriented dialogue that models facial expressions of users, in particular, facial expressions related to confusion. The findings indicate that the affectenriched classifiers perform significantly better for distinguishing user requests for feedback and grounding dialogue acts within textual dialogue. The results point to ways in which dialogue systems can effectively leverage affective channels to improve dialogue act classification. 1</p><p>3 0.19284318 <a title="312-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Entrainment_in_Speech_Preceding_Backchannels..html">118 acl-2011-Entrainment in Speech Preceding Backchannels.</a></p>
<p>Author: Rivka Levitan ; Agustin Gravano ; Julia Hirschberg</p><p>Abstract: In conversation, when speech is followed by a backchannel, evidence of continued engagement by one’s dialogue partner, that speech displays a combination of cues that appear to signal to one’s interlocutor that a backchannel is appropriate. We term these cues backchannel-preceding cues (BPC)s, and examine the Columbia Games Corpus for evidence of entrainment on such cues. Entrainment, the phenomenon of dialogue partners becoming more similar to each other, is widely believed to be crucial to conversation quality and success. Our results show that speaking partners entrain on BPCs; that is, they tend to use similar sets of BPCs; this similarity increases over the course of a dialogue; and this similarity is associated with measures of dialogue coordination and task success. 1</p><p>4 0.16795012 <a title="312-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Joint_Identification_and_Segmentation_of_Domain-Specific_Dialogue_Acts_for_Conversational_Dialogue_Systems.html">185 acl-2011-Joint Identification and Segmentation of Domain-Specific Dialogue Acts for Conversational Dialogue Systems</a></p>

<p>Author: Je Hun Jeon ; Wen Wang ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we adopt an n-best rescoring scheme using pitch-accent patterns to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance. The pitch-accent model is decoupled from the main ASR system, thus allowing us to develop it independently. N-best hypotheses from recognizers are rescored by additional scores that measure the correlation of the pitch-accent patterns between the acoustic signal and lexical cues. To test the robustness of our algorithm, we use two different data sets and recognition setups: the first one is English radio news data that has pitch accent labels, but the recognizer is trained from a small amount ofdata and has high error rate; the second one is English broadcast news data using a state-of-the-art SRI recognizer. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach is able to reduce word error rate relatively by about 3%. This gain is consistent across the two different tests, showing promising future directions of incorporating prosodic information to improve speech recognition.</p><p>6 0.15002757 <a title="312-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Data-oriented_Monologue-to-Dialogue_Generation.html">91 acl-2011-Data-oriented Monologue-to-Dialogue Generation</a></p>

<p>Author: Heather Friedberg</p><p>Abstract: Most spoken dialogue systems are still lacking in their ability to accurately model the complex process that is human turntaking. This research analyzes a humanhuman tutoring corpus in order to identify prosodic turn-taking cues, with the hopes that they can be used by intelligent tutoring systems to predict student turn boundaries. Results show that while there was variation between subjects, three features were significant turn-yielding cues overall. In addition, a positive relationship between the number of cues present and the probability of a turn yield was demonstrated. 1</p><p>2 0.93246263 <a title="312-lsi-2" href="./acl-2011-Entrainment_in_Speech_Preceding_Backchannels..html">118 acl-2011-Entrainment in Speech Preceding Backchannels.</a></p>
<p>Author: Rivka Levitan ; Agustin Gravano ; Julia Hirschberg</p><p>Abstract: In conversation, when speech is followed by a backchannel, evidence of continued engagement by one’s dialogue partner, that speech displays a combination of cues that appear to signal to one’s interlocutor that a backchannel is appropriate. We term these cues backchannel-preceding cues (BPC)s, and examine the Columbia Games Corpus for evidence of entrainment on such cues. Entrainment, the phenomenon of dialogue partners becoming more similar to each other, is widely believed to be crucial to conversation quality and success. Our results show that speaking partners entrain on BPCs; that is, they tend to use similar sets of BPCs; this similarity increases over the course of a dialogue; and this similarity is associated with measures of dialogue coordination and task success. 1</p><p>3 0.6972844 <a title="312-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-An_Affect-Enriched_Dialogue_Act_Classification_Model_for_Task-Oriented_Dialogue.html">33 acl-2011-An Affect-Enriched Dialogue Act Classification Model for Task-Oriented Dialogue</a></p>

Although the importance of emotion in human dialogue is widely recognized, most dialogue act classification models make limited or no use of affective channels in dialogue act classification. This paper presents a novel affect-enriched dialogue act classifier for task-oriented dialogue that models facial expressions of users, in particular, facial expressions related to confusion. The findings indicate that the affectenriched classifiers perform significantly better for distinguishing user requests for feedback and grounding dialogue acts within textual dialogue. The results point to ways in which dialogue systems can effectively leverage affective channels to improve dialogue act classification. 1</p><p>4 0.68162912 <a title="312-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Question_Detection_in_Spoken_Conversations_Using_Textual_Conversations.html">257 acl-2011-Question Detection in Spoken Conversations Using Textual Conversations</a></p>

We compare the text-trained model with models trained on manuallylabeled, domain-matched spoken utterances with and without prosodic features.

<p>Author: Je Hun Jeon ; Wen Wang ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we adopt an n-best rescoring scheme using pitch-accent patterns to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance. The pitch-accent model is decoupled from the main ASR system, thus allowing us to develop it independently. N-best hypotheses from recognizers are rescored by additional scores that measure the correlation of the pitch-accent patterns between the acoustic signal and lexical cues. To test the robustness of our algorithm, we use two different data sets and recognition setups: the first one is English radio news data that has pitch accent labels, but the recognizer is trained from a small amount ofdata and has high error rate; the second one is English broadcast news data using a state-of-the-art SRI recognizer. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach is able to reduce word error rate relatively by about 3%. This gain is consistent across the two different tests, showing promising future directions of incorporating prosodic information to improve speech recognition.</p><p>6 0.657866 <a title="312-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Joint_Identification_and_Segmentation_of_Domain-Specific_Dialogue_Acts_for_Conversational_Dialogue_Systems.html">185 acl-2011-Joint Identification and Segmentation of Domain-Specific Dialogue Acts for Conversational Dialogue Systems</a></p>

<p>Author: Eyal Shnarch ; Jacob Goldberger ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing entailment at the lexical level is an important and commonly-addressed component in textual inference. Yet, this task has been mostly approached by simplified heuristic methods. This paper proposes an initial probabilistic modeling framework for lexical entailment, with suitable EM-based parameter estimation. Our model considers prominent entailment factors, including differences in lexical-resources reliability and the impacts of transitivity and multiple evidence. Evaluations show that the proposed model outperforms most prior systems while pointing at required future improvements. 1 Introduction and Background Textual Entailment was proposed as a generic paradigm for applied semantic inference (Dagan et al., 2006). This task requires deciding whether a tex- tual statement (termed the hypothesis-H) can be inferred (entailed) from another text (termed the textT). Since it was first introduced, the six rounds of the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) challenges1 , currently organized under NIST, have become a standard benchmark for entailment systems. These systems tackle their complex task at various levels of inference, including logical representation (Tatu and Moldovan, 2007; MacCartney and Manning, 2007), semantic analysis (Burchardt et al., 2007) and syntactic parsing (Bar-Haim et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009). Inference at these levels usually 1http://www.nist.gov/tac/2010/RTE/index.html 558 requires substantial processing and resources (e.g. parsing) aiming at high performance. Nevertheless, simple entailment methods, performing at the lexical level, provide strong baselines which most systems did not outperform (Mirkin et al., 2009; Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010). Within complex systems, lexical entailment modeling is an important component. Finally, there are cases in which a full system cannot be used (e.g. lacking a parser for a targeted language) and one must resort to the simpler lexical approach. While lexical entailment methods are widely used, most of them apply ad hoc heuristics which do not rely on a principled underlying framework. Typically, such methods quantify the degree of lexical coverage of the hypothesis terms by the text’s terms. Coverage is determined either by a direct match of identical terms in T and H or by utilizing lexical semantic resources, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), that capture lexical entailment relations (denoted here as entailment rules). Common heuristics for quantifying the degree of coverage are setting a threshold on the percentage coverage of H’s terms (Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010), counting absolute number of uncovered terms (Clark and Harrison, 2010), or applying an Information Retrievalstyle vector space similarity score (MacKinlay and Baldwin, 2009). Other works (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005; Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006) have applied a heuristic formula to estimate the similarity between text fragments based on a similarity function between their terms. These heuristics do not capture several important aspects of entailment, such as varying reliability of Proceedings ofP thoer t4l9atnhd A, Onrnuegaoln M,e Jeuntineg 19 o-f2 t4h,e 2 A0s1s1o.c?i ac t2io0n11 fo Ar Cssoocmiaptuiotanti foonra Clo Lminpguutiast i ocns:aslh Loirntpgaupisetrics , pages 558–563, entailment resources and the impact of rule chaining and multiple evidence on entailment likelihood. An additional observation from these and other systems is that their performance improves only moderately when utilizing lexical resources2. We believe that the textual entailment field would benefit from more principled models for various entailment phenomena. Inspired by the earlier steps in the evolution of Statistical Machine Translation methods (such as the initial IBM models (Brown et al., 1993)), we formulate a concrete generative probabilistic modeling framework that captures the basic aspects of lexical entailment. Parameter estimation is addressed by an EM-based approach, which enables estimating the hidden lexical-level entailment parameters from entailment annotations which are available only at the sentence-level. While heuristic methods are limited in their ability to wisely integrate indications for entailment, probabilistic methods have the advantage of being extendable and enabling the utilization of wellfounded probabilistic methods such as the EM algorithm. We compared the performance of several model variations to previously published results on RTE data sets, as well as to our own implementation of typical lexical baselines. Results show that both the probabilistic model and our percentagecoverage baseline perform favorably relative to prior art. These results support the viability of the probabilistic framework while pointing at certain modeling aspects that need to be improved. 2 Probabilistic Model Under the lexical entailment scope, our modeling goal is obtaining a probabilistic score for the likelihood that all H’s terms are entailed by T. To that end, we model prominent aspects of lexical entailment, which were mostly neglected by previous lexical methods: (1) distinguishing different reliability levels of lexical resources; (2) allowing transitive chains of rule applications and considering their length when estimating their validity; and (3) considering multiple entailments when entailing a term. 2See ablation tests reports in http://aclweb.org/aclwiki/ index.php?title=RTE Knowledge Resources#Ablation Tests 559 Figure 1: The generative process of entailing terms of a hypothesis from a text. Edges represent entailment rules. There are 3 evidences for the entailment of hi :a rule from Resource1 , another one from Resource3 both suggesting that tj entails it, and a chain from t1through an intermediate term t0. 2.1 Model Description For T to entail H it is usually a necessary, but not sufficient, that every term h ∈ H would be entsauiflefidci by ,at t hleatast e one t teerrmm mt h ∈ ∈T (Glickman eet al., 2006). Figure s1t odneescr tiebrmes tth ∈e process komf entailing hypothesis terms. The trivial case is when identical terms, possibly at the stem or lemma level, appear in T and H (a direct match as tn and hm in Figure 1). Alternatively, we can establish entailment based on knowledge of entailing lexical-semantic relations, such as synonyms, hypernyms and morphological derivations, available in lexical resources (e.g the rule inference → reasoning from WordNet). (We.eg d theneo rutel by R(r) cthee → resource nwgh ficroh provided teht)e. rule r. Since entailment is a transitive relation, rules may compose transitive chains that connect a term t ∈ T ctoo a pteosrme rha ∈ Hive through hinatte cromnendeicatte a tteerrmms. t ∈Fo Tr instance, fr hom ∈ t hHe r thurleosu infer → inference armnds inference → reasoning we can dre →duc inef tehreen rcuele a infer → reasoning (were inference dise dthuec ein thteerm rueldeia intef trer →m as t0 in Figure 1). Multiple chains may connect t to h (as for tj and hi in Figure 1) or connect several terms in T to h (as t1 and tj are indicating the entailment of hi in Figure 1), thus providing multiple evidence for h’s entailment. It is reasonable to expect that if a term t indeed entails a term h, it is likely to find evidences for this relation in several resources. Taking a probabilistic perspective, we assume a parameter θR for each resource R, denoting its reliability, i.e. the prior probability that applying a rule from R corresponds to a valid entailment instance. Direct matches are considered as a special “resource”, called MATCH, for which θMATCH is expected to be close to 1. We now present our probabilistic model. For a text term t ∈ T to entail a hypothesis term h by a tcehxatin te c, mde tn ∈ote Td by etn →tcai h, thhyep application mof h every r ∈ c must be valid.

The probability that T does not entail h at all (by any chain), specified in Eq. 2, is the probability that all these chains are not valid. Finally, the probability that T entails all of H, assuming independence of H’s terms, is the probability that every h ∈ H is entailed, as given ien p Eq. a3b. Nityot tihceat t ehvaet yth here ∈ c oHul ids be a term h which is not covered by any available rule chain. Under this formulation, we assume that each such h is covered by a single rule coming from a special “resource” called UNCOVERED (expecting θUNCOVERED to be relatively small). p(t −→c h) = Yp(lhs →r rhs) = Yr∈c p(T 9 h) = Y YθR(r)(1) Yr∈c [1 − p(t− →c h)] (2) c∈YC(h) p(T → H) = Y p(T → h) (3) hY∈H As can be seen, our model indeed distinguishes varying resource reliability, decreases entailment probability as rule chains grow and increases it when entailment of a term is supported by multiple chains. The above treatment of uncovered terms in H, as captured in Eq. 3, assumes that their entailment probability is independent of the rest of the hypothesis. However, when the number of covered hypothesis terms increases the probability that the remaining terms are actually entailed by T increases too 560 (even though we do not have supporting knowledge for their entailment). Thus, an alternative model is to group all uncovered terms together and estimate the overall probability of their joint entailment as a function of the lexical coverage of the hypothesis. We denote Hc as the subset of H’s terms which are covered by some rule chain and Huc as the remaining uncovered part. Eq. 3a then provides a refined entailment model for H, in which the second term specifies the probability that Huc is entailed given that Hc is validly entailed and the corresponding lengths: p(T→H) = [Yp(T→h)]·p(T→Huc hY∈Hc 2.2 | |Hc|,|H|) (3a) Parameter Estimation The difficulty in estimating the θR values is that these are term-level parameters while the RTEtraining entailment annotation is given for the sentence-level. Therefore, we use EM-based estimation for the hidden parameters (Dempster et al., 1977). In the E step we use the current θR values to compute all whcr (T, H) values for each training pair. whcr (T, H) stands for the posterior probability that application of the rule r in the chain c for h ∈ H tish valid, given nth oaft heieth reurl eT r e innta thiles c Hha or not ra hcc ∈ord Hing to the training annotation (see Eq. 4). Remember that a rule r provides an entailment relation between its left-hand-side (lhs) and its right-hand-side (rhs). Therefore Eq. 4 uses the notation lhs →r rhs to designate the application of the rule r (similar htos Eq. 1). wEhc:r(T,H)=   p (lTh9→sH−→ |rlhsrp−→ rh(Tsr→9|hTsH )9→p(lhHs−→ r) =hs)if(4T)9→H After applying Bayes’ rule we get a fraction with Eq. 3 in its denominator and θR(r) as the second term of the numerator. The first numerator term is defined as in Eq. 3 except that for the corresponding rule application we substitute θR(r) by 1(per the conditioning event). The probabilistic model defined by Eq. 1-3 is a loop-free directed acyclic graphical model (aka a Bayesian network). Hence the E-step probabilities can be efficiently calculated using the belief propagation algorithm (Pearl, 1988). The M step uses Eq. 5 to update the parameter set. For each resource R we average the whcr (T, H) val- ues for all its rule applications in the training, whose total number is denoted nR.

We also tried initializing the EM algorithm with these direct estimations but did not obtain performance improvements. 3 Evaluations and Results The 5th Recognizing Textual Entailment challenge (RTE-5) introduced a new search task (Bentivogli et al., 2009) which became the main task in RTE6 (Bentivogli et al., 2010). In this task participants should find all sentences that entail a given hypothesis in a given document cluster. This task’s data sets reflect a natural distribution of entailments in a corpus and demonstrate a more realistic scenario than the previous RTE challenges. In our system, sentences are tokenized and stripped of stop words and terms are lemmatized and tagged for part-of-speech. As lexical resources we use WordNet (WN) (Fellbaum, 1998), taking as entailment rules synonyms, derivations, hyponyms and meronyms of the first senses of T and H terms, and the CatVar (Categorial Variation) database (Habash and Dorr, 2003). We allow rule chains of length up to 4 in WordNet (WN4). We compare our model to two types of baselines: (1) RTE published results: the average of the best runs of all systems, the best and second best performing lexical systems and the best full system of each challenge; (2) our implementation of lexical 561 coverage model, tuning the percentage-of-coverage threshold for entailment on the training set. This model uses the same configuration as ourprobabilistic model. We also implemented an Information Re- trieval style baseline3 (both with and without lexical expansions), but given its poorer performance we omit its results here. Table 1 presents the results. We can see that both our implemented models (probabilistic and coverage) outperform all RTE lexical baselines on both data sets, apart from (Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010) which incorporates additional lexical resources, a named entity recognizer and a co-reference system. On RTE-5, the probabilistic model is comparable in performance to the best full system, while the coverage model achieves considerably better results. We notice that our implemented models successfully utilize resources to increase performance, as opposed to typical smaller or less consistent improvements in prior works (see Section 1).

In particular, WN4 performs better than the single-step WN only on RTE-5, suggesting the need to improve the modeling of chain- ing. The fluctuations over the data sets and impacts of resources suggest the need for further investigation over additional data sets and resources. As for the coverage model, under our configuration it poses a bigger challenge for RTE systems than perviously reported baselines. It is thus proposed as an easy to implement baseline for future entailment research. 4 Conclusions and Future Work This paper presented, for the first time, a principled and relatively rich probabilistic model for lexical entailment, amenable for estimation of hidden lexicallevel parameters from standard sentence-level annotations. The positive results of the probabilistic model compared to prior art and its ability to exploit lexical resources indicate its future potential. Yet, further investigation is needed. For example, analyzing current model’s limitations, we observed that the multiplicative nature of eqs. 1and 3 (reflecting independence assumptions) is too restrictive, resembling a logical AND. Accordingly we plan to explore relaxing this strict conjunctive behavior through models such as noisy-AND (Pearl, 1988). We also intend to explore the contribution of our model, and particularly its estimated parameter values, within a complex system that integrates multiple levels of inference.

<p>Author: Heather Friedberg</p><p>Abstract: Most spoken dialogue systems are still lacking in their ability to accurately model the complex process that is human turntaking. This research analyzes a humanhuman tutoring corpus in order to identify prosodic turn-taking cues, with the hopes that they can be used by intelligent tutoring systems to predict student turn boundaries. Results show that while there was variation between subjects, three features were significant turn-yielding cues overall. In addition, a positive relationship between the number of cues present and the probability of a turn yield was demonstrated. 1</p><p>3 0.65866804 <a title="312-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Shift-Reduce_CCG_Parsing.html">282 acl-2011-Shift-Reduce CCG Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Yue Zhang ; Stephen Clark</p><p>Abstract: CCGs are directly compatible with binarybranching bottom-up parsing algorithms, in particular CKY and shift-reduce algorithms. While the chart-based approach has been the dominant approach for CCG, the shift-reduce method has been little explored. In this paper, we develop a shift-reduce CCG parser using a discriminative model and beam search, and compare its strengths and weaknesses with the chart-based C&C; parser. We study different errors made by the two parsers, and show that the shift-reduce parser gives competitive accuracies compared to C&C.; Considering our use of a small beam, and given the high ambiguity levels in an automatically-extracted grammar and the amount of information in the CCG lexical categories which form the shift actions, this is a surprising result.</p><p>4 0.60704815 <a title="312-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Learning_to_Grade_Short_Answer_Questions_using_Semantic_Similarity_Measures_and_Dependency_Graph_Alignments.html">205 acl-2011-Learning to Grade Short Answer Questions using Semantic Similarity Measures and Dependency Graph Alignments</a></p>

We combine several graph alignment features with lexical semantic similarity measures using machine learning techniques and show that the student answers can be more accurately graded than if the semantic measures were used in isolation. We also present a first attempt to align the dependency graphs of the student and the instructor answers in order to make use of a structural component in the automatic grading of student answers.</p><p>5 0.58545041 <a title="312-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Identifying_Word_Translations_from_Comparable_Corpora_Using_Latent_Topic_Models.html">161 acl-2011-Identifying Word Translations from Comparable Corpora Using Latent Topic Models</a></p>

In this paper, we investigate the value of bilingual topic models, i.e., a bilingual Latent Dirichlet Allocation model for finding translations of terms in comparable corpora without using any linguistic resources. Experiments on a document-aligned English-Italian Wikipedia corpus confirm that the developed methods which only use knowledge from word-topic distributions outperform methods based on similarity measures in the original word-document space. The best results, obtained by combining knowledge from wordtopic distributions with similarity measures in the original space, are also reported.</p><p>6 0.52707356 <a title="312-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-An_Affect-Enriched_Dialogue_Act_Classification_Model_for_Task-Oriented_Dialogue.html">33 acl-2011-An Affect-Enriched Dialogue Act Classification Model for Task-Oriented Dialogue</a></p>

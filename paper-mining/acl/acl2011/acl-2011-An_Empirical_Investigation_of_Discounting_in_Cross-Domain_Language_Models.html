<p>Author: Hinrich Schutze</p><p>Abstract: Building on earlier work that integrates different factors in language modeling, we view (i) backing off to a shorter history and (ii) class-based generalization as two complementary mechanisms of using a larger equivalence class for prediction when the default equivalence class is too small for reliable estimation. This view entails that the classes in a language model should be learned from rare events only and should be preferably applied to rare events. We construct such a model and show that both training on rare events and preferable application to rare events improve perplexity when compared to a simple direct interpolation of class-based with standard language models.</p><p>3 0.13326643 <a title="38-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Generalized_Interpolation_in_Decision_Tree_LM.html">142 acl-2011-Generalized Interpolation in Decision Tree LM</a></p>
<p>Author: Denis Filimonov ; Mary Harper</p><p>Abstract: In the face of sparsity, statistical models are often interpolated with lower order (backoff) models, particularly in Language Modeling. In this paper, we argue that there is a relation between the higher order and the backoff model that must be satisfied in order for the interpolation to be effective. We show that in n-gram models, the relation is trivially held, but in models that allow arbitrary clustering of context (such as decision tree models), this relation is generally not satisfied. Based on this insight, we also propose a generalization of linear interpolation which significantly improves the performance of a decision tree language model.</p><p>4 0.088992558 <a title="38-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-A_Scalable_Probabilistic_Classifier_for_Language_Modeling.html">24 acl-2011-A Scalable Probabilistic Classifier for Language Modeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Joel Lang</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel probabilistic classifier, which scales well to problems that involve a large number ofclasses and require training on large datasets. A prominent example of such a problem is language modeling. Our classifier is based on the assumption that each feature is associated with a predictive strength, which quantifies how well the feature can predict the class by itself. The predictions of individual features can then be combined according to their predictive strength, resulting in a model, whose parameters can be reliably and efficiently estimated.

<p>Author: Sankaranarayanan Ananthakrishnan ; Rohit Prasad ; Prem Natarajan</p><p>Abstract: The language model (LM) is a critical component in most statistical machine translation (SMT) systems, serving to establish a probability distribution over the hypothesis space. Most SMT systems use a static LM, independent of the source language input. While previous work has shown that adapting LMs based on the input improves SMT performance, none of the techniques has thus far been shown to be feasible for on-line systems. In this paper, we develop a novel measure of cross-lingual similarity for biasing the LM based on the test input. We also illustrate an efficient on-line implementation that supports integration with on-line SMT systems by transferring much of the computational load off-line. Our approach yields significant reductions in target perplexity compared to the static LM, as well as consistent improvements in SMT performance across language pairs (English-Dari and English-Pashto).</p><p>6 0.46361259 <a title="38-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Improved_Modeling_of_Out-Of-Vocabulary_Words_Using_Morphological_Classes.html">163 acl-2011-Improved Modeling of Out-Of-Vocabulary Words Using Morphological Classes</a></p>

<p>Author: Clifton McFate ; Kenneth Forbus</p><p>Abstract: Broad coverage lexicons for the English language have traditionally been handmade. This approach, while accurate, requires too much human labor. Furthermore, resources contain gaps in coverage, contain specific types of information, or are incompatible with other resources. We believe that the state of open-license technology is such that a comprehensive syntactic lexicon can be automatically compiled. This paper describes the creation of such a lexicon, NU-LEX, an open-license feature-based lexicon for general purpose parsing that combines WordNet, VerbNet, and Wiktionary and contains over 100,000 words. NU-LEX was integrated into a bottom up chart parser. We ran the parser through three sets of sentences, 50 sentences total, from the Simple English Wikipedia and compared its performance to the same parser using Comlex. Both parsers performed almost equally with NU-LEX finding all lex-items for 50% of the sentences and Comlex succeeding for 52%. Furthermore, NULEX’s shortcomings primarily fell into two categories, suggesting future research directions. 1</p><p>2 0.95233101 <a title="38-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Contrasting_Multi-Lingual_Prosodic_Cues_to_Predict_Verbal_Feedback_for_Rapport.html">83 acl-2011-Contrasting Multi-Lingual Prosodic Cues to Predict Verbal Feedback for Rapport</a></p>
<p>Author: Siwei Wang ; Gina-Anne Levow</p><p>Abstract: Verbal feedback is an important information source in establishing interactional rapport. However, predicting verbal feedback across languages is challenging due to languagespecific differences, inter-speaker variation, and the relative sparseness and optionality of verbal feedback. In this paper, we employ an approach combining classifier weighting and SMOTE algorithm oversampling to improve verbal feedback prediction in Arabic, English, and Spanish dyadic conversations. This approach improves the prediction of verbal feedback, up to 6-fold, while maintaining a high overall accuracy. Analyzing highly weighted features highlights widespread use of pitch, with more varied use of intensity and duration.</p><p>3 0.94815075 <a title="38-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Identifying_the_Semantic_Orientation_of_Foreign_Words.html">162 acl-2011-Identifying the Semantic Orientation of Foreign Words</a></p>
<p>Author: Ahmed Hassan ; Amjad AbuJbara ; Rahul Jha ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for identifying the positive or negative semantic orientation of foreign words. Identifying the semantic orientation of words has numerous applications in the areas of text classification, analysis of product review, analysis of responses to surveys, and mining online discussions. Identifying the semantic orientation of English words has been extensively studied in literature. Most of this work assumes the existence of resources (e.g. Wordnet, seeds, etc) that do not exist in foreign languages. In this work, we describe a method based on constructing a multilingual network connecting English and foreign words. We use this network to identify the semantic orientation of foreign words based on connection between words in the same language as well as multilingual connections. The method is experimentally tested using a manually labeled set of positive and negative words and has shown very promising results.</p><p>4 0.93672711 <a title="38-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Hierarchical_Reinforcement_Learning_and_Hidden_Markov_Models_for_Task-Oriented_Natural_Language_Generation.html">149 acl-2011-Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning and Hidden Markov Models for Task-Oriented Natural Language Generation</a></p>
<p>Author: Nina Dethlefs ; Heriberto Cuayahuitl</p><p>Abstract: Surface realisation decisions in language generation can be sensitive to a language model, but also to decisions of content selection. We therefore propose the joint optimisation of content selection and surface realisation using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). To this end, we suggest a novel reward function that is induced from human data and is especially suited for surface realisation. It is based on a generation space in the form of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Results in terms of task success and human-likeness suggest that our unified approach performs better than greedy or random baselines.</p><p>5 0.88916248 <a title="38-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Neutralizing_Linguistically_Problematic_Annotations_in_Unsupervised_Dependency_Parsing_Evaluation.html">230 acl-2011-Neutralizing Linguistically Problematic Annotations in Unsupervised Dependency Parsing Evaluation</a></p>
<p>Author: Roy Schwartz ; Omri Abend ; Roi Reichart ; Ari Rappoport</p><p>Abstract: Dependency parsing is a central NLP task. In this paper we show that the common evaluation for unsupervised dependency parsing is highly sensitive to problematic annotations. We show that for three leading unsupervised parsers (Klein and Manning, 2004; Cohen and Smith, 2009; Spitkovsky et al., 2010a), a small set of parameters can be found whose modification yields a significant improvement in standard evaluation measures. These parameters correspond to local cases where no linguistic consensus exists as to the proper gold annotation. Therefore, the standard evaluation does not provide a true indication of algorithm quality. We present a new measure, Neutral Edge Direction (NED), and show that it greatly reduces this undesired phenomenon.</p><p>6 0.85535556 <a title="38-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Hindi_to_Punjabi_Machine_Translation_System.html">151 acl-2011-Hindi to Punjabi Machine Translation System</a></p>

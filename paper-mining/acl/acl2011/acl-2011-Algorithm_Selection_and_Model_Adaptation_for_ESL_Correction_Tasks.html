</p><p>5 1 Introduction There has been a lot of recent work on correcting writing mistakes made by English as a Second Language (ESL) learners (Izumi et al. [sent-9, score-0.181]
</p><p>6 Most of this work has focused on correcting mistakes in article and preposition usage, which are some of the most common error types among nonnative writers of English (Dalgish, 1985; Bitchener et al. [sent-15, score-0.786]
</p><p>7 “He is an engineer with a passion to*/for what he does. [sent-21, score-0.169]
</p><p>8 Approaches to correcting preposition and article mistakes have adopted the methods of the contextsensitive spelling correction task, which addresses the problem of correcting spelling mistakes that result in legitimate words, such as confusing their and there (Carlson et al. [sent-24, score-0.933]

</p><p>10 sMioond seelst {fothre correcting article and preposition errors are similarly trained on error-free native English text, where the confusion set includes all articles or prepositions (Izumi et al. [sent-38, score-0.922]
</p><p>11 Several conclusions have been made when comparing systems developed for ESL correction tasks. [sent-53, score-0.177]
</p><p>12 In this work, we compare four popular learning methods applied to the problem of correcting preposition and article errors and evaluate on a common ESL data set. [sent-59, score-0.657]
</p><p>13 The second important question that we address is that of adapting the decision to the source language of the writer. [sent-68, score-0.159]
</p><p>14 Adapting a model so that it takes into consideration the specific error patterns of the non-native writers was shown to be extremely helpful in the context of discriminative classifiers (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010c; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010b). [sent-70, score-0.188]
</p><p>15 Specifically, we show how the error patterns of the non-native writers can be viewed as a different distribution on candidate priors in the confusion set. [sent-73, score-0.46]
</p><p>16 A related idea has been applied in Word Sense Disambiguation to adjust the model priors to a new domain with different sense distributions (Chan and Ng, 2005). [sent-75, score-0.181]
</p><p>17 First, we conduct a fair comparison of four learning algorithms and show that the discriminative approach Averaged Perceptron is the best performing model (Sec. [sent-77, score-0.142]
</p><p>18 In fact, we show that SumLM is comparable to Averaged Perceptron trained with a 10 times smaller corpus, and language model is comparable to Averaged Perceptron trained with a 2 times smaller corpus. [sent-81, score-0.17]
</p><p>19 As we show, adapting to the source language of the writer provides significant performance improvement, and our new method also performs better than previous, more complicated methods. [sent-84, score-0.304]
</p><p>20 2  The Models  The standard approach to preposition correction is to cast the problem as a multi-class classification task and train a classifier on features defined on the surrounding context2. [sent-88, score-0.614]
</p><p>21 The model selects the most likely candidate from the confusion set, where the set of candidates includes the top n most frequent English prepositions. [sent-89, score-0.161]
</p><p>22 We use p tmo rfoerf,er o ,t oa a tc,a ton,d iadta, itne preposition from ConfSet. [sent-91, score-0.377]
</p><p>23 Let preposition context denote the preposition and  the window around it. [sent-92, score-0.832]
</p><p>24 For instance, “a passion to what he” is a context for window size 2. [sent-93, score-0.247]
</p><p>25 We use three feature sets, varying window size from 2 to 4 words on each side (see Table 1). [sent-94, score-0.142]
</p><p>26 passion p what We implement four linear learning models: the discriminative method Averaged Perceptron (AP); two probabilistic methods a language model (LM) and Na ı¨ve Bayes (NB); and a “counting” method SumLM (Bergsma et al. [sent-97, score-0.272]
</p><p>27 Since all of the models are linear, the hypotheses generated by the algorithms differ only in the weights they assign to the features  s+m  –  2We also report one experiment on the article correction task. [sent-100, score-0.349]
</p><p>28 We take the preposition correction task as an example; the article case is treated in the same way. [sent-101, score-0.641]
</p><p>29 The usage of the ten most frequent prepositions accounts for 82% of all preposition errors  (Leacock et al. [sent-105, score-0.52]
</p><p>30 All feature sets consist of word n-grams of various lengths spanning the preposition and vary by n-gram length and window size. [sent-109, score-0.491]

</p><p>36 NB architecture is also particularly well-suited for adapting the model to the first language of the writer (Section 4). [sent-149, score-0.263]
</p><p>37 Weights in NB are determined, similarly to LM, by the feature counts and the prior probability of each candidate p (Eq. [sent-150, score-0.182]

[sent-155, score-0.147]
</p><p>39 1 Evaluation Data We evaluate the models using a corpus of ESL essays, annotated7 by native English speakers (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010a). [sent-158, score-0.187]
</p><p>40 For each preposition 6SumLM is one of several related methods proposed in this work; its accuracy on the preposition selection task on native English data nearly matches the best model, SuperLM (73. [sent-159, score-0.877]
</p><p>41 The first corpus, WikiNYT, is a selection of texts from English Wikipedia and the New York Times section of the Gigaword corpus and contains 107 preposition contexts. [sent-174, score-0.377]
</p><p>42 Thus, we cannot generate training data for AP for feature sets Win3 and Win4: Since the algorithm does not assume feature independence, we need to have 7 and 9-word sequences, respectively, with a preposition in the middle (as shown in Table 1) and their corpus frequencies. [sent-182, score-0.449]
</p><p>43 From GoogleWeb, we also generate a smaller training set of size 108: We use 5-grams with a preposition in the middle and generate a new 8Training size refers to the number of preposition  contexts. [sent-189, score-0.84]
</p><p>44 For instance, a preposition 5-gram with a count of 2600 in GoogleWeb, will have a count of 10 in GoogleWeb-108. [sent-191, score-0.377]

</p><p>46 , with twice as much data; the performance of LM trained on 107 contexts is better than that of AP trained with 10 times less data (106), but not as good as that of AP trained with half as much data (5· 106); AP outperforms SumLM, when the lattdeart uses 1100 times more data.

</p><p>49 We now show a fair comparison of the four algorithms for different window sizes, training data and training sizes. [sent-207, score-0.179]
</p><p>50 AP (106 preposition contexts) performs as well as SumLM with 10 times more data, and LM requires at least twice as much data to achieve the performance of AP. [sent-214, score-0.422]
</p><p>51 AAUC is a measure  commonly used to generate a summary statistic and is computed here as an average precision value over 12 recall points (from 5 to 60):  AAUC =112·Xi=121Precision(i · 5) The Table also shows results on the article correction  task11. [sent-216, score-0.299]
</p><p>52 The last row shows performance on the article correction task. [sent-219, score-0.264]
</p><p>53 11We do not evaluate the LM approach on the article correction task, since with LM it is difficult to handle missing article errors, one of the most common error types for articles, but the  expectation is that it will behave as it does for prepositions. [sent-221, score-0.426]
</p><p>54 1 Effects of Window Size We found that expanding window size from 2 to 3 is helpful for all of the models, but expanding win-  dow to 4 is only helpful for the models trained on GoogleWeb (Table 6). [sent-225, score-0.176]
</p><p>55 This number goes up 7 times to 28% for GoogleWeb, which explains why increasing the window size is helpful for this model. [sent-229, score-0.151]
</p><p>56 By comparison, a set of native English sentences (different from the training data) has 50% more 4-grams and about 3 times more 5-grams, because ESL sentences often contain expressions not common for native speakers. [sent-230, score-0.291]
</p><p>57 4  Adapting to Writer’s Source Language  In this section, we discuss adapting error correction systems to the first language of the writer. [sent-233, score-0.332]
</p><p>58 Non-  native speakers make mistakes in a systematic manner, and errors often depend on the first language of the writer (Lee and Seneff, 2008; Rozovskaya and  TaNE bSealsLtive7-:B0F9eatWuriGeko TNcrgoalYeviWnT er-ba1g07efo9r8-2% ESLN96-g273ar% namdl623e94an%g tihve2174d8305%a t. [sent-234, score-0.484]
</p><p>59 When trained on annotated ESL data instead of native data, systems improve both precision and recall (Han et al. [sent-242, score-0.198]
</p><p>60 Annotated data include both the writer’s preposition and the intended (correct)  one, and thus the knowledge about typical errors is made available to the system. [sent-244, score-0.458]
</p><p>61 Another way to adapt a model to the first language is to generate in native training data artificial errors mimicking the typical errors of the non-native writers (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010c; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010b). [sent-245, score-0.39]
</p><p>62 However, for the model to use these language-specific error statistics, a separate classifier for each source language needs to be trained. [sent-248, score-0.149]
</p><p>63 The method relies on the observation that error regularities can be viewed as a distribution on priors over the correction candidates. [sent-251, score-0.433]
</p><p>64 Given a preposition s in text, the prior for candidate p is the probability that p is the correct preposition for s. [sent-252, score-0.9]
</p><p>65 If a model is trained on native data without adaptation to the source language, candidate priors correspond to the relative frequen-  cies of the candidates in the native training data. [sent-253, score-0.649]
</p><p>66 More importantly, these priors remain the same re930 gardless of the source language of the writer or of the preposition used in text. [sent-254, score-0.782]
</p><p>67 From the model’s perspective, it means that a correction candidate, for example to, is equally likely given that the author’s preposition is for or from, which is clearly incorrect and disagrees with the notion that errors are regular and language-dependent. [sent-255, score-0.635]
</p><p>68 We use the annotated ESL data and define adapted candidate priors that are dependent on the author’s preposition and the author’s source language. [sent-256, score-0.796]
</p><p>69 Let s be a preposition appearing in text by a writer of source language L1, and p a correction candidate. [sent-257, score-0.778]
</p><p>70 Then the adapted prior of p given s is:  prior(p,s,L1) =CCLL11((ss,)p), where CL1 (s) denotes the number of times s appeared in the ESL data by L1 writers, and CL1 (s, p) denotes the number of times p was the correct preposition when s was used by an L1 writer. [sent-258, score-0.744]
</p><p>71 Table 8 shows adapted candidate priors for two author’s choices when an ESL writer used on and at based on the data from Chinese learners. [sent-259, score-0.561]
</p><p>72 One key distinction of the adapted priors is the high probability assigned to the author’s preposition: the new prior for on given that it is also the preposition found in text is 0. [sent-260, score-0.775]
</p><p>73 The adapted prior of preposition p, when p is used, is always high, because the majority of prepositions are used correctly. [sent-264, score-0.656]
</p><p>74 For example, the adapted prior for at when the writer chose on is 0. [sent-266, score-0.4]
</p><p>75 To determine a mechanism to inject the adapted priors into a model, we note that while all of our models use priors in some way, NB architecture directly specifies the prior probability as one of its parameters (Sec. [sent-268, score-0.609]
</p><p>76 We thus train NB in a traditional way, on native data, and then replace the prior component in Eq. [sent-271, score-0.233]

</p><p>78 Global prior denotes the probability of the candidate in the standard model and is based on the relative frequency of the candidate in native training data. [sent-273, score-0.362]
</p><p>79 Adapted priors are dependent on the author’s preposition and the author’s first language. [sent-274, score-0.558]
</p><p>80 Adapted priors for the author’s choice are very high. [sent-275, score-0.181]
</p><p>81 Other candidates are given higher priors if they often appear as corrections for the author’s choice. [sent-276, score-0.21]
</p><p>82 Both of the adapted models use the same error statistics in k-fold cross-validation (CV): We randomly partition the ESL data into k parts, with each part tested on the model that uses error statistics estimated on the remaining k − 1 parts. [sent-283, score-0.314]
</p><p>83 Although we observe similar behavior on all the data, the models especially benefit from the adapted priors when a particular error occurred more than once. [sent-286, score-0.464]
</p><p>84 Since the majority of errors are not due  to chance, we focus on those errors that the writers will make repeatedly. [sent-287, score-0.234]

</p><p>86 Second, for the recall points less than 20%, the adapted models obtain very similar precision values. [sent-295, score-0.199]
</p><p>87 Finally, an important performance distinction between the two adapted models is the loss in recall exhibited by AP-adapted its curve is shorter becauseAP-adapted is very conservative and does not propose many corrections. [sent-300, score-0.199]
</p><p>88 In 2-fold CV, priors are estimated on 50% ofthe ESL data, in 10-fold on 90%, and in Leave-One-Out on all data but the testing example. [sent-303, score-0.181]
</p><p>89 –  The model converges very quickly: there is almost no difference between 10-fold CV and Leave-OneOut, which suggests that we can get a good estimate of the priors using just a little annotated data. [sent-305, score-0.181]
</p><p>90 In 2-fold CV, priors are estimated on 50% of the data; in 10-fold on 90% of the  data; in Leave-One-Out, the new priors are based on all the data but the testing example. [sent-309, score-0.362]
</p><p>91 12Note that this baseline is different from the majority baseline used in the preposition selection task, since here we have the author’s preposition in text. [sent-322, score-0.754]
</p><p>92 The model comparison was performed using two popular tasks correcting errors in article and preposition usage and we expect that our re–  –  sults will generalize to other ESL correction tasks. [sent-330, score-0.805]

A variety of learning algorithms have been applied to correct ESL mistakes, but often comparisons were made between incomparable data sets. We conduct an extensive, fair comparison of four popular learning methods for the task, reversing conclusions from earlier evaluations. Our results hold for different training sets, genres, and feature sets. A second key issue in ESL error correction is the adaptation of a model to the first language ofthe writer. Errors made by non-native speakers exhibit certain regularities and, as we show, models perform much better when they use knowledge about error patterns of the nonnative writers. We propose a novel way to adapt a learned algorithm to the first language of the writer that is both cheaper to implement and performs better than other adaptation methods.</p><p>2 0.33071047 <a title="32-tfidf-2" href="./acl-2011-They_Can_Help%3A_Using_Crowdsourcing_to_Improve_the_Evaluation_of_Grammatical_Error_Detection_Systems.html">302 acl-2011-They Can Help: Using Crowdsourcing to Improve the Evaluation of Grammatical Error Detection Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Nitin Madnani ; Martin Chodorow ; Joel Tetreault ; Alla Rozovskaya</p><p>Abstract: Despite the rising interest in developing grammatical error detection systems for non-native speakers of English, progress in the field has been hampered by a lack of informative metrics and an inability to directly compare the performance of systems developed by different researchers. In this paper we address these problems by presenting two evaluation methodologies, both based on a novel use of crowdsourcing. 1 Motivation and Contributions One of the fastest growing areas in need of NLP tools is the field of grammatical error detection for learners of English as a Second Language (ESL). According to Guo and Beckett (2007), “over a billion people speak English as their second or for- eign language.” This high demand has resulted in many NLP research papers on the topic, a Synthesis Series book (Leacock et al., 2010) and a recurring workshop (Tetreault et al., 2010a), all in the last five years. In this year’s ACL conference, there are four long papers devoted to this topic. Despite the growing interest, two major factors encumber the growth of this subfield. First, the lack of consistent and appropriate score reporting is an issue. Most work reports results in the form of precision and recall as measured against the judgment of a single human rater. This is problematic because most usage errors (such as those in article and preposition usage) are a matter of degree rather than simple rule violations such as number agreement. As a consequence, it is common for two native speakers 508 to have different judgments of usage. Therefore, an appropriate evaluation should take this into account by not only enlisting multiple human judges but also aggregating these judgments in a graded manner. Second, systems are hardly ever compared to each other. In fact, to our knowledge, no two systems developed by different groups have been compared directly within the field primarily because there is no common corpus or shared task—both commonly found in other NLP areas such as machine translation.1 For example, Tetreault and Chodorow (2008), Gamon et al. (2008) and Felice and Pulman (2008) developed preposition error detection systems, but evaluated on three different corpora using different evaluation measures. The goal of this paper is to address the above issues by using crowdsourcing, which has been proven effective for collecting multiple, reliable judgments in other NLP tasks: machine translation (Callison-Burch, 2009; Zaidan and CallisonBurch, 2010), speech recognition (Evanini et al., 2010; Novotney and Callison-Burch, 2010), automated paraphrase generation (Madnani, 2010), anaphora resolution (Chamberlain et al., 2009), word sense disambiguation (Akkaya et al., 2010), lexicon construction for less commonly taught languages (Irvine and Klementiev, 2010), fact mining (Wang and Callison-Burch, 2010) and named entity recognition (Finin et al., 2010) among several others. In particular, we make a significant contribution to the field by showing how to leverage crowdsourc1There has been a recent proposal for a related shared task (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2010) that shows promise.

Our solution is general enough for, in the simplest case, intrinsically evaluating a single system on a single dataset and, more realistically, comparing two different systems (from same or different groups). 2 A Case Study: Extraneous Prepositions We consider the problem of detecting an extraneous preposition error, i.e., incorrectly using a preposition where none is licensed. In the sentence “They came to outside”, the preposition to is an extraneous error whereas in the sentence “They arrived to the town” the preposition to is a confusion error (cf. arrived in the town). Most work on automated correction of preposition errors, with the exception of Gamon (2010), addresses preposition confusion errors e.g., (Felice and Pulman, 2008; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010b). One reason is that in addition to the standard context-based features used to detect confusion errors, identifying extraneous prepositions also requires actual knowledge of when a preposition can and cannot be used. Despite this lack of attention, extraneous prepositions account for a significant proportion—as much as 18% in essays by advanced English learners (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010a)—of all preposition usage errors. 2.1 Data and Systems For the experiments in this paper, we chose a proprietary corpus of about 500,000 essays written by ESL students for Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL?R). Despite being common ESL errors, preposition errors are still infrequent overall, with over 90% of prepositions being used correctly (Leacock et al., 2010; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010a). Given this fact about error sparsity, we needed an efficient method to extract a good number of error instances (for statistical reliability) from the large essay corpus. We found all trigrams in our essays containing prepositions as the middle word (e.g., marry with her) and then looked up the counts of each tri- gram and the corresponding bigram with the preposition removed (marry her) in the Google Web1T 5-gram Corpus. If the trigram was unattested or had a count much lower than expected based on the bi509 gram count, then we manually inspected the trigram to see whether it was actually an error. If it was, we extracted a sentence from the large essay corpus containing this erroneous trigram. Once we had extracted 500 sentences containing extraneous preposition error instances, we added 500 sentences containing correct instances of preposition usage. This yielded a corpus of 1000 sentences with a 50% error rate. These sentences, with the target preposition highlighted, were presented to 3 expert annotators who are native English speakers. They were asked to annotate the preposition usage instance as one of the following: extraneous (Error), not extraneous (OK) or too hard to decide (Unknown); the last category was needed for cases where the context was too messy to make a decision about the highlighted preposition. On average, the three experts had an agreement of 0.87 and a kappa of 0.75. For subse- quent analysis, we only use the classes Error and OK since Unknown was used extremely rarely and never by all 3 experts for the same sentence. We used two different error detection systems to illustrate our evaluation methodology:2 • • 3 LM: A 4-gram language model trained on tLhMe Google Wme lba1nTg 5-gram Corpus dw oithn SRILM (Stolcke, 2002).

Crowdsourcing Recently,we showed that Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) is a cheap and effective alternative to expert raters for annotating preposition errors (Tetreault et al., 2010b). In other current work, we have extended this pilot study to show that CrowdFlower, a crowdsourcing service that allows for stronger quality con- × trol on untrained human raters (henceforth, Turkers), is more reliable than AMT on three different error detection tasks (article errors, confused prepositions 2Any conclusions drawn in this paper pertain only to these specific instantiations of the two systems. & extraneous prepositions). To impose such quality control, one has to provide “gold” instances, i.e., examples with known correct judgments that are then used to root out any Turkers with low performance on these instances. For all three tasks, we obtained 20 Turkers’ judgments via CrowdFlower for each instance and found that, on average, only 3 Turkers were required to match the experts. More specifically, for the extraneous preposition error task, we used 75 sentences as gold and obtained judgments for the remaining 923 non-gold sentences.3 We found that if we used 3 Turker judgments in a majority vote, the agreement with any one of the three expert raters is, on average, 0.87 with a kappa of 0.76. This is on par with the inter-expert agreement and kappa found earlier (0.87 and 0.75 respectively). The extraneous preposition annotation cost only $325 (923 judgments 20 Turkers) and was com- pleted 9in2 a single day. T 2h0e only rres)st arnicdtio wna on tmheTurkers was that they be physically located in the USA. For the analysis in subsequent sections, we use these 923 sentences and the respective 20 judgments obtained via CrowdFlower. The 3 expert judgments are not used any further in this analysis. 4 Revamping System Evaluation In this section, we provide details on how crowdsourcing can help revamp the evaluation of error detection systems: (a) by providing more informative measures for the intrinsic evaluation of a single system (§ 4. 1), and (b) by easily enabling system comparison (§ 4.2). 4.1 Crowd-informed Evaluation Measures When evaluating the performance of grammatical error detection systems against human judgments, the judgments for each instance are generally reduced to the single most frequent category: Error or OK. This reduction is not an accurate reflection of a complex phenomenon. It discards valuable information about the acceptability of usage because it treats all “bad” uses as equal (and all good ones as equal), when they are not. Arguably, it would be fairer to use a continuous scale, such as the proportion of raters who judge an instance as correct or 3We found 2 duplicate sentences and removed them. 510 incorrect. For example, if 90% of raters agree on a rating of Error for an instance of preposition usage, then that is stronger evidence that the usage is an error than if 56% of Turkers classified it as Error and 44% classified it as OK (the sentence “In addition classmates play with some game and enjoy” is an example). The regular measures of precision and recall would be fairer if they reflected this reality. Besides fairness, another reason to use a continuous scale is that of stability, particularly with a small number of instances in the evaluation set (quite common in the field). By relying on majority judgments, precision and recall measures tend to be unstable (see below). We modify the measures of precision and recall to incorporate distributions of correctness, obtained via crowdsourcing, in order to make them fairer and more stable indicators of system performance. Given an error detection system that classifies a sentence containing a specific preposition as Error (class 1) if the preposition is extraneous and OK (class 0) otherwise, we propose the following weighted versions of hits (Hw), misses (Mw) and false positives (FPw): XN Hw = X(csiys ∗ picrowd) (1) Xi XN Mw = X((1 − csiys) ∗ picrowd) (2) Xi XN FPw = X(csiys ∗ (1 − picrowd)) (3) Xi In the above equations, N is the total number of instances, csiys is the class (1 or 0) , and picrowd indicates the proportion of the crowd that classified instance i as Error. Note that if we were to revert to the majority crowd judgment as the sole judgment for each instance, instead of proportions, picrowd would always be either 1 or 0 and the above formulae would simply compute the normal hits, misses and false positives. Given these definitions, weighted precision can be defined as Precisionw = Hw/(Hw Hw/(Hw + FPw) and weighted + Mw). recall as Recallw = agreement Figure 1: Histogram of Turker agreements for all 923 instances on whether a preposition is extraneous. UWnwei gihg tede Pr0 e.c9 i5s0i70onR0 .e3 c78al14l Table 1: Comparing commonly used (unweighted) and proposed (weighted) precision/recall measures for LM. To illustrate the utility of these weighted measures, we evaluated the LM and PERC systems on the dataset containing 923 preposition instances, against all 20 Turker judgments. Figure 1 shows a histogram of the Turker agreement for the majority rating over the set. Table 1 shows both the unweighted (discrete majority judgment) and weighted (continuous Turker proportion) versions of precision and recall for this system. The numbers clearly show that in the unweighted case, the performance of the system is overestimated simply because the system is getting as much credit for each contentious case (low agreement) as for each clear one (high agreement). In the weighted measure we propose, the contentious cases are weighted lower and therefore their contribution to the overall performance is reduced. This is a fairer representation since the system should not be expected to perform as well on the less reliable instances as it does on the clear-cut instances. Essentially, if humans cannot consistently decide whether 511 [n=93] [n=1 14] Agreement Bin [n=71 6] Figure 2: Unweighted precision/recall by agreement bins for LM & PERC. a case is an error then a system’s output cannot be considered entirely right or entirely wrong.4 As an added advantage, the weighted measures are more stable. Consider a contentious instance in a small dataset where 7 out of 15 Turkers (a minority) classified it as Error. However, it might easily have happened that 8 Turkers (a majority) classified it as Error instead of 7. In that case, the change in unweighted precision would have been much larger than is warranted by such a small change in the data. However, weighted precision is guaranteed to be more stable. Note that the instability decreases as the size of the dataset increases but still remains a problem. 4.2 Enabling System Comparison In this section, we show how to easily compare different systems both on the same data (in the ideal case of a shared dataset being available) and, more realistically, on different datasets. Figure 2 shows (unweighted) precision and recall of LM and PERC (computed against the majority Turker judgment) for three agreement bins, where each bin is defined as containing only the instances with Turker agreement in a specific range. We chose the bins shown 4The difference between unweighted and weighted measures can vary depending on the distribution of agreement. since they are sufficiently large and represent a reasonable stratification of the agreement space. Note that we are not weighting the precision and recall in this case since we have already used the agreement proportions to create the bins. This curve enables us to compare the two systems easily on different levels of item contentiousness and, therefore, conveys much more information than what is usually reported (a single number for unweighted precision/recall over the whole corpus). For example, from this graph, PERC is seen to have similar performance as LM for the 75-90% agreement bin. In addition, even though LM precision is perfect (1.0) for the most contentious instances (the 50-75% bin), this turns out to be an artifact of the LM classifier’s decision process. When it must decide between what it views as two equally likely possibilities, it defaults to OK. Therefore, even though LM has higher unweighted precision (0.957) than PERC (0.813), it is only really better on the most clear-cut cases (the 90-100% bin). If one were to report unweighted precision and recall without using any bins—as is the norm—this important qualification would have been harder to discover. While this example uses the same dataset for evaluating two systems, the procedure is general enough to allow two systems to be compared on two different datasets by simply examining the two plots. However, two potential issues arise in that case. The first is that the bin sizes will likely vary across the two plots. However, this should not be a significant problem as long as the bins are sufficiently large. A second, more serious, issue is that the error rates (the proportion of instances that are actually erroneous) in each bin may be different across the two plots. To handle this, we recommend that a kappa-agreement plot be used instead of the precision-agreement plot shown here. 5 Conclusions Our goal is to propose best practices to address the two primary problems in evaluating grammatical error detection systems and we do so by leveraging crowdsourcing. For system development, we rec- ommend that rather than compressing multiple judgments down to the majority, it is better to use agreement proportions to weight precision and recall to 512 yield fairer and more stable indicators of performance. For system comparison, we argue that the best solution is to use a shared dataset and present the precision-agreement plot using a set of agreed-upon bins (possibly in conjunction with the weighted precision and recall measures) for a more informative comparison. However, we recognize that shared datasets are harder to create in this field (as most of the data is proprietary). Therefore, we also provide a way to compare multiple systems across different datasets by using kappa-agreement plots. As for agreement bins, we posit that the agreement values used to define them depend on the task and, therefore, should be determined by the community. Note that both of these practices can also be implemented by using 20 experts instead of 20 Turkers. However, we show that crowdsourcing yields judgments that are as good but without the cost. To facilitate the adoption of these practices, we make all our evaluation code and data available to the com- munity.5 Acknowledgments We would first like to thank our expert annotators Sarah Ohls and Waverely VanWinkle for their hours of hard work.

<p>Author: Y. Albert Park ; Roger Levy</p><p>Abstract: Automated grammar correction techniques have seen improvement over the years, but there is still much room for increased performance. Current correction techniques mainly focus on identifying and correcting a specific type of error, such as verb form misuse or preposition misuse, which restricts the corrections to a limited scope. We introduce a novel technique, based on a noisy channel model, which can utilize the whole sentence context to determine proper corrections. We show how to use the EM algorithm to learn the parameters of the noise model, using only a data set of erroneous sentences, given the proper language model. This frees us from the burden of acquiring a large corpora of corrected sentences. We also present a cheap and efficient way to provide automated evaluation re- sults for grammar corrections by using BLEU and METEOR, in contrast to the commonly used manual evaluations.</p><p>5 0.21560994 <a title="32-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Models_and_Training_for_Unsupervised_Preposition_Sense_Disambiguation.html">224 acl-2011-Models and Training for Unsupervised Preposition Sense Disambiguation</a></p>

<p>Author: Alla Rozovskaya ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of correcting errors made by English as a Second Language (ESL) writers and address two issues that are essential to making progress in ESL error correction - algorithm selection and model adaptation to the first language of the ESL learner. A variety of learning algorithms have been applied to correct ESL mistakes, but often comparisons were made between incomparable data sets. We conduct an extensive, fair comparison of four popular learning methods for the task, reversing conclusions from earlier evaluations. Our results hold for different training sets, genres, and feature sets. A second key issue in ESL error correction is the adaptation of a model to the first language ofthe writer. Errors made by non-native speakers exhibit certain regularities and, as we show, models perform much better when they use knowledge about error patterns of the nonnative writers. We propose a novel way to adapt a learned algorithm to the first language of the writer that is both cheaper to implement and performs better than other adaptation methods.</p><p>2 0.8793447 <a title="32-lsi-2" href="./acl-2011-Grammatical_Error_Correction_with_Alternating_Structure_Optimization.html">147 acl-2011-Grammatical Error Correction with Alternating Structure Optimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Nitin Madnani ; Martin Chodorow ; Joel Tetreault ; Alla Rozovskaya</p><p>Abstract: Despite the rising interest in developing grammatical error detection systems for non-native speakers of English, progress in the field has been hampered by a lack of informative metrics and an inability to directly compare the performance of systems developed by different researchers. In this paper we address these problems by presenting two evaluation methodologies, both based on a novel use of crowdsourcing. 1 Motivation and Contributions One of the fastest growing areas in need of NLP tools is the field of grammatical error detection for learners of English as a Second Language (ESL). According to Guo and Beckett (2007), “over a billion people speak English as their second or for- eign language.” This high demand has resulted in many NLP research papers on the topic, a Synthesis Series book (Leacock et al., 2010) and a recurring workshop (Tetreault et al., 2010a), all in the last five years. In this year’s ACL conference, there are four long papers devoted to this topic. Despite the growing interest, two major factors encumber the growth of this subfield. First, the lack of consistent and appropriate score reporting is an issue. Most work reports results in the form of precision and recall as measured against the judgment of a single human rater. This is problematic because most usage errors (such as those in article and preposition usage) are a matter of degree rather than simple rule violations such as number agreement. As a consequence, it is common for two native speakers 508 to have different judgments of usage. Therefore, an appropriate evaluation should take this into account by not only enlisting multiple human judges but also aggregating these judgments in a graded manner. Second, systems are hardly ever compared to each other. In fact, to our knowledge, no two systems developed by different groups have been compared directly within the field primarily because there is no common corpus or shared task—both commonly found in other NLP areas such as machine translation.1 For example, Tetreault and Chodorow (2008), Gamon et al. (2008) and Felice and Pulman (2008) developed preposition error detection systems, but evaluated on three different corpora using different evaluation measures. The goal of this paper is to address the above issues by using crowdsourcing, which has been proven effective for collecting multiple, reliable judgments in other NLP tasks: machine translation (Callison-Burch, 2009; Zaidan and CallisonBurch, 2010), speech recognition (Evanini et al., 2010; Novotney and Callison-Burch, 2010), automated paraphrase generation (Madnani, 2010), anaphora resolution (Chamberlain et al., 2009), word sense disambiguation (Akkaya et al., 2010), lexicon construction for less commonly taught languages (Irvine and Klementiev, 2010), fact mining (Wang and Callison-Burch, 2010) and named entity recognition (Finin et al., 2010) among several others. In particular, we make a significant contribution to the field by showing how to leverage crowdsourc1There has been a recent proposal for a related shared task (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2010) that shows promise. Proceedings ofP thoer t4l9atnhd A, Onrnuegaoln M,e Jeuntineg 19 o-f2 t4h,e 2 A0s1s1o.c?i ac t2io0n11 fo Ar Cssoocmiaptuiotanti foonra Clo Lminpguutiast i ocns:aslh Loirntpgaupisetrics , pages 508–513, ing to both address the lack ofappropriate evaluation metrics and to make system comparison easier. Our solution is general enough for, in the simplest case, intrinsically evaluating a single system on a single dataset and, more realistically, comparing two different systems (from same or different groups). 2 A Case Study: Extraneous Prepositions We consider the problem of detecting an extraneous preposition error, i.e., incorrectly using a preposition where none is licensed. In the sentence “They came to outside”, the preposition to is an extraneous error whereas in the sentence “They arrived to the town” the preposition to is a confusion error (cf. arrived in the town). Most work on automated correction of preposition errors, with the exception of Gamon (2010), addresses preposition confusion errors e.g., (Felice and Pulman, 2008; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010b). One reason is that in addition to the standard context-based features used to detect confusion errors, identifying extraneous prepositions also requires actual knowledge of when a preposition can and cannot be used. Despite this lack of attention, extraneous prepositions account for a significant proportion—as much as 18% in essays by advanced English learners (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010a)—of all preposition usage errors. 2.1 Data and Systems For the experiments in this paper, we chose a proprietary corpus of about 500,000 essays written by ESL students for Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL?R). Despite being common ESL errors, preposition errors are still infrequent overall, with over 90% of prepositions being used correctly (Leacock et al., 2010; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010a). Given this fact about error sparsity, we needed an efficient method to extract a good number of error instances (for statistical reliability) from the large essay corpus. We found all trigrams in our essays containing prepositions as the middle word (e.g., marry with her) and then looked up the counts of each tri- gram and the corresponding bigram with the preposition removed (marry her) in the Google Web1T 5-gram Corpus. If the trigram was unattested or had a count much lower than expected based on the bi509 gram count, then we manually inspected the trigram to see whether it was actually an error. If it was, we extracted a sentence from the large essay corpus containing this erroneous trigram. Once we had extracted 500 sentences containing extraneous preposition error instances, we added 500 sentences containing correct instances of preposition usage. This yielded a corpus of 1000 sentences with a 50% error rate. These sentences, with the target preposition highlighted, were presented to 3 expert annotators who are native English speakers. They were asked to annotate the preposition usage instance as one of the following: extraneous (Error), not extraneous (OK) or too hard to decide (Unknown); the last category was needed for cases where the context was too messy to make a decision about the highlighted preposition. On average, the three experts had an agreement of 0.87 and a kappa of 0.75. For subse- quent analysis, we only use the classes Error and OK since Unknown was used extremely rarely and never by all 3 experts for the same sentence. We used two different error detection systems to illustrate our evaluation methodology:2 • • 3 LM: A 4-gram language model trained on tLhMe Google Wme lba1nTg 5-gram Corpus dw oithn SRILM (Stolcke, 2002).

Crowdsourcing Recently,we showed that Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) is a cheap and effective alternative to expert raters for annotating preposition errors (Tetreault et al., 2010b). In other current work, we have extended this pilot study to show that CrowdFlower, a crowdsourcing service that allows for stronger quality con- × trol on untrained human raters (henceforth, Turkers), is more reliable than AMT on three different error detection tasks (article errors, confused prepositions 2Any conclusions drawn in this paper pertain only to these specific instantiations of the two systems. & extraneous prepositions). To impose such quality control, one has to provide “gold” instances, i.e., examples with known correct judgments that are then used to root out any Turkers with low performance on these instances. For all three tasks, we obtained 20 Turkers’ judgments via CrowdFlower for each instance and found that, on average, only 3 Turkers were required to match the experts. More specifically, for the extraneous preposition error task, we used 75 sentences as gold and obtained judgments for the remaining 923 non-gold sentences.3 We found that if we used 3 Turker judgments in a majority vote, the agreement with any one of the three expert raters is, on average, 0.87 with a kappa of 0.76. This is on par with the inter-expert agreement and kappa found earlier (0.87 and 0.75 respectively). The extraneous preposition annotation cost only $325 (923 judgments 20 Turkers) and was com- pleted 9in2 a single day. T 2h0e only rres)st arnicdtio wna on tmheTurkers was that they be physically located in the USA. For the analysis in subsequent sections, we use these 923 sentences and the respective 20 judgments obtained via CrowdFlower. The 3 expert judgments are not used any further in this analysis. 4 Revamping System Evaluation In this section, we provide details on how crowdsourcing can help revamp the evaluation of error detection systems: (a) by providing more informative measures for the intrinsic evaluation of a single system (§ 4. 1), and (b) by easily enabling system comparison (§ 4.2). 4.1 Crowd-informed Evaluation Measures When evaluating the performance of grammatical error detection systems against human judgments, the judgments for each instance are generally reduced to the single most frequent category: Error or OK. This reduction is not an accurate reflection of a complex phenomenon. It discards valuable information about the acceptability of usage because it treats all “bad” uses as equal (and all good ones as equal), when they are not. Arguably, it would be fairer to use a continuous scale, such as the proportion of raters who judge an instance as correct or 3We found 2 duplicate sentences and removed them. 510 incorrect. For example, if 90% of raters agree on a rating of Error for an instance of preposition usage, then that is stronger evidence that the usage is an error than if 56% of Turkers classified it as Error and 44% classified it as OK (the sentence “In addition classmates play with some game and enjoy” is an example). The regular measures of precision and recall would be fairer if they reflected this reality. Besides fairness, another reason to use a continuous scale is that of stability, particularly with a small number of instances in the evaluation set (quite common in the field). By relying on majority judgments, precision and recall measures tend to be unstable (see below). We modify the measures of precision and recall to incorporate distributions of correctness, obtained via crowdsourcing, in order to make them fairer and more stable indicators of system performance. Given an error detection system that classifies a sentence containing a specific preposition as Error (class 1) if the preposition is extraneous and OK (class 0) otherwise, we propose the following weighted versions of hits (Hw), misses (Mw) and false positives (FPw): XN Hw = X(csiys ∗ picrowd) (1) Xi XN Mw = X((1 − csiys) ∗ picrowd) (2) Xi XN FPw = X(csiys ∗ (1 − picrowd)) (3) Xi In the above equations, N is the total number of instances, csiys is the class (1 or 0) , and picrowd indicates the proportion of the crowd that classified instance i as Error. Note that if we were to revert to the majority crowd judgment as the sole judgment for each instance, instead of proportions, picrowd would always be either 1 or 0 and the above formulae would simply compute the normal hits, misses and false positives. Given these definitions, weighted precision can be defined as Precisionw = Hw/(Hw Hw/(Hw + FPw) and weighted + Mw). recall as Recallw = agreement Figure 1: Histogram of Turker agreements for all 923 instances on whether a preposition is extraneous. UWnwei gihg tede Pr0 e.c9 i5s0i70onR0 .e3 c78al14l Table 1: Comparing commonly used (unweighted) and proposed (weighted) precision/recall measures for LM. To illustrate the utility of these weighted measures, we evaluated the LM and PERC systems on the dataset containing 923 preposition instances, against all 20 Turker judgments. Figure 1 shows a histogram of the Turker agreement for the majority rating over the set. Table 1 shows both the unweighted (discrete majority judgment) and weighted (continuous Turker proportion) versions of precision and recall for this system. The numbers clearly show that in the unweighted case, the performance of the system is overestimated simply because the system is getting as much credit for each contentious case (low agreement) as for each clear one (high agreement). In the weighted measure we propose, the contentious cases are weighted lower and therefore their contribution to the overall performance is reduced. This is a fairer representation since the system should not be expected to perform as well on the less reliable instances as it does on the clear-cut instances. Essentially, if humans cannot consistently decide whether 511 [n=93] [n=1 14] Agreement Bin [n=71 6] Figure 2: Unweighted precision/recall by agreement bins for LM & PERC. a case is an error then a system’s output cannot be considered entirely right or entirely wrong.4 As an added advantage, the weighted measures are more stable. Consider a contentious instance in a small dataset where 7 out of 15 Turkers (a minority) classified it as Error. However, it might easily have happened that 8 Turkers (a majority) classified it as Error instead of 7. In that case, the change in unweighted precision would have been much larger than is warranted by such a small change in the data. However, weighted precision is guaranteed to be more stable. Note that the instability decreases as the size of the dataset increases but still remains a problem. 4.2 Enabling System Comparison In this section, we show how to easily compare different systems both on the same data (in the ideal case of a shared dataset being available) and, more realistically, on different datasets. Figure 2 shows (unweighted) precision and recall of LM and PERC (computed against the majority Turker judgment) for three agreement bins, where each bin is defined as containing only the instances with Turker agreement in a specific range. We chose the bins shown 4The difference between unweighted and weighted measures can vary depending on the distribution of agreement. since they are sufficiently large and represent a reasonable stratification of the agreement space. Note that we are not weighting the precision and recall in this case since we have already used the agreement proportions to create the bins. This curve enables us to compare the two systems easily on different levels of item contentiousness and, therefore, conveys much more information than what is usually reported (a single number for unweighted precision/recall over the whole corpus). For example, from this graph, PERC is seen to have similar performance as LM for the 75-90% agreement bin. In addition, even though LM precision is perfect (1.0) for the most contentious instances (the 50-75% bin), this turns out to be an artifact of the LM classifier’s decision process. When it must decide between what it views as two equally likely possibilities, it defaults to OK. Therefore, even though LM has higher unweighted precision (0.957) than PERC (0.813), it is only really better on the most clear-cut cases (the 90-100% bin). If one were to report unweighted precision and recall without using any bins—as is the norm—this important qualification would have been harder to discover. While this example uses the same dataset for evaluating two systems, the procedure is general enough to allow two systems to be compared on two different datasets by simply examining the two plots. However, two potential issues arise in that case. The first is that the bin sizes will likely vary across the two plots. However, this should not be a significant problem as long as the bins are sufficiently large. A second, more serious, issue is that the error rates (the proportion of instances that are actually erroneous) in each bin may be different across the two plots. To handle this, we recommend that a kappa-agreement plot be used instead of the precision-agreement plot shown here. 5 Conclusions Our goal is to propose best practices to address the two primary problems in evaluating grammatical error detection systems and we do so by leveraging crowdsourcing. For system development, we rec- ommend that rather than compressing multiple judgments down to the majority, it is better to use agreement proportions to weight precision and recall to 512 yield fairer and more stable indicators of performance. For system comparison, we argue that the best solution is to use a shared dataset and present the precision-agreement plot using a set of agreed-upon bins (possibly in conjunction with the weighted precision and recall measures) for a more informative comparison. However, we recognize that shared datasets are harder to create in this field (as most of the data is proprietary). Therefore, we also provide a way to compare multiple systems across different datasets by using kappa-agreement plots. As for agreement bins, we posit that the agreement values used to define them depend on the task and, therefore, should be determined by the community. Note that both of these practices can also be implemented by using 20 experts instead of 20 Turkers. However, we show that crowdsourcing yields judgments that are as good but without the cost. To facilitate the adoption of these practices, we make all our evaluation code and data available to the com- munity.5 Acknowledgments We would first like to thank our expert annotators Sarah Ohls and Waverely VanWinkle for their hours of hard work.

<p>Author: Y. Albert Park ; Roger Levy</p><p>Abstract: Automated grammar correction techniques have seen improvement over the years, but there is still much room for increased performance. Current correction techniques mainly focus on identifying and correcting a specific type of error, such as verb form misuse or preposition misuse, which restricts the corrections to a limited scope. We introduce a novel technique, based on a noisy channel model, which can utilize the whole sentence context to determine proper corrections. We show how to use the EM algorithm to learn the parameters of the noise model, using only a data set of erroneous sentences, given the proper language model. This frees us from the burden of acquiring a large corpora of corrected sentences. We also present a cheap and efficient way to provide automated evaluation re- sults for grammar corrections by using BLEU and METEOR, in contrast to the commonly used manual evaluations.</p><p>5 0.74212468 <a title="32-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Creating_a_manually_error-tagged_and_shallow-parsed_learner_corpus.html">88 acl-2011-Creating a manually error-tagged and shallow-parsed learner corpus</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryo Nagata ; Edward Whittaker ; Vera Sheinman</p><p>Abstract: The availability of learner corpora, especially those which have been manually error-tagged or shallow-parsed, is still limited. This means that researchers do not have a common development and test set for natural language processing of learner English such as for grammatical error detection. Given this background, we created a novel learner corpus that was manually error-tagged and shallowparsed. This corpus is available for research and educational purposes on the web. In this paper, we describe it in detail together with its data-collection method and annotation schemes. Another contribution of this paper is that we take the first step toward evaluating the performance of existing POStagging/chunking techniques on learner corpora using the created corpus. These contributions will facilitate further research in related areas such as grammatical error detection and automated essay scoring.</p><p>6 0.72508019 <a title="32-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-EdIt%3A_A_Broad-Coverage_Grammar_Checker_Using_Pattern_Grammar.html">108 acl-2011-EdIt: A Broad-Coverage Grammar Checker Using Pattern Grammar</a></p>

<p>Author: Alla Rozovskaya ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of correcting errors made by English as a Second Language (ESL) writers and address two issues that are essential to making progress in ESL error correction - algorithm selection and model adaptation to the first language of the ESL learner. A variety of learning algorithms have been applied to correct ESL mistakes, but often comparisons were made between incomparable data sets. We conduct an extensive, fair comparison of four popular learning methods for the task, reversing conclusions from earlier evaluations. Our results hold for different training sets, genres, and feature sets. A second key issue in ESL error correction is the adaptation of a model to the first language ofthe writer. Errors made by non-native speakers exhibit certain regularities and, as we show, models perform much better when they use knowledge about error patterns of the nonnative writers. We propose a novel way to adapt a learned algorithm to the first language of the writer that is both cheaper to implement and performs better than other adaptation methods.</p><p>2 0.79364771 <a title="32-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Prototyping_virtual_instructors_from_human-human_corpora.html">252 acl-2011-Prototyping virtual instructors from human-human corpora</a></p>
<p>Author: Luciana Benotti ; Alexandre Denis</p><p>Abstract: Virtual instructors can be used in several applications, ranging from trainers in simulated worlds to non player characters for virtual games. In this paper we present a novel algorithm for rapidly prototyping virtual instructors from human-human corpora without manual annotation. Automatically prototyping full-fledged dialogue systems from corpora is far from being a reality nowadays. Our algorithm is restricted in that only the virtual instructor can perform speech acts while the user responses are limited to physical actions in the virtual world. We evaluate a virtual instructor, generated using this algorithm, with human users. We compare our results both with human instructors and rule-based virtual instructors hand-coded for the same task.</p><p>3 0.78954643 <a title="32-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Recognizing_Named_Entities_in_Tweets.html">261 acl-2011-Recognizing Named Entities in Tweets</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaohua LIU ; Shaodian ZHANG ; Furu WEI ; Ming ZHOU</p><p>Abstract: The challenges of Named Entities Recognition (NER) for tweets lie in the insufficient information in a tweet and the unavailability of training data. We propose to combine a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier with a linear Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model under a semi-supervised learning framework to tackle these challenges. The KNN based classifier conducts pre-labeling to collect global coarse evidence across tweets while the CRF model conducts sequential labeling to capture fine-grained information encoded in a tweet. The semi-supervised learning plus the gazetteers alleviate the lack of training data. Extensive experiments show the advantages of our method over the baselines as well as the effectiveness of KNN and semisupervised learning.</p><p>4 0.77889454 <a title="32-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Underspecifying_and_Predicting_Voice_for_Surface_Realisation_Ranking.html">317 acl-2011-Underspecifying and Predicting Voice for Surface Realisation Ranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Sina Zarriess ; Aoife Cahill ; Jonas Kuhn</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses a data-driven surface realisation model based on a large-scale reversible grammar of German. We investigate the relationship between the surface realisation performance and the character of the input to generation, i.e. its degree of underspecification. We extend a syntactic surface realisation system, which can be trained to choose among word order variants, such that the candidate set includes active and passive variants. This allows us to study the interaction of voice and word order alternations in realistic German corpus data. We show that with an appropriately underspecified input, a linguistically informed realisation model trained to regenerate strings from the underlying semantic representation achieves 91.5% accuracy (over a baseline of 82.5%) in the prediction of the original voice. 1</p><p>5 0.77498531 <a title="32-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Data-oriented_Monologue-to-Dialogue_Generation.html">91 acl-2011-Data-oriented Monologue-to-Dialogue Generation</a></p>
<p>Author: Paul Piwek ; Svetlana Stoyanchev</p><p>Abstract: This short paper introduces an implemented and evaluated monolingual Text-to-Text generation system. The system takes monologue and transforms it to two-participant dialogue. After briefly motivating the task of monologue-to-dialogue generation, we describe the system and present an evaluation in terms of fluency and accuracy.</p><p>6 0.76955318 <a title="32-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Creating_a_manually_error-tagged_and_shallow-parsed_learner_corpus.html">88 acl-2011-Creating a manually error-tagged and shallow-parsed learner corpus</a></p>

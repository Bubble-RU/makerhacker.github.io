<p>Author: Yves Petinot ; Kathleen McKeown ; Kapil Thadani</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the relevance of hierarchical topic models to represent the content of Web gists. We focus our attention on DMOZ, a popular Web directory, and propose two algorithms to infer such a model from its manually-curated hierarchy of categories. Our first approach, based on information-theoretic grounds, uses an algorithm similar to recursive feature selection. Our second approach is fully Bayesian and derived from the more general model, hierarchical LDA. We evaluate the performance of both models against a flat 1-gram baseline and show improvements in terms of perplexity over held-out data.</p><p>3 0.13195057 <a title="150-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Confidence-Weighted_Learning_of_Factored_Discriminative_Language_Models.html">78 acl-2011-Confidence-Weighted Learning of Factored Discriminative Language Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Viet Ha Thuc ; Nicola Cancedda</p><p>Abstract: Language models based on word surface forms only are unable to benefit from available linguistic knowledge, and tend to suffer from poor estimates for rare features. We propose an approach to overcome these two limitations. We use factored features that can flexibly capture linguistic regularities, and we adopt confidence-weighted learning, a form of discriminative online learning that can better take advantage of a heavy tail of rare features. Finally, we extend the confidence-weighted learning to deal with label noise in training data, a common case with discriminative lan- guage modeling.</p><p>4 0.10378804 <a title="150-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Exact_Decoding_of_Syntactic_Translation_Models_through_Lagrangian_Relaxation.html">123 acl-2011-Exact Decoding of Syntactic Translation Models through Lagrangian Relaxation</a></p>

<p>Author: Asli Celikyilmaz ; Dilek Hakkani-Tur</p><p>Abstract: Extractive methods for multi-document summarization are mainly governed by information overlap, coherence, and content constraints. We present an unsupervised probabilistic approach to model the hidden abstract concepts across documents as well as the correlation between these concepts, to generate topically coherent and non-redundant summaries. Based on human evaluations our models generate summaries with higher linguistic quality in terms of coherence, readability, and redundancy compared to benchmark systems. Although our system is unsupervised and optimized for topical coherence, we achieve a 44.1 ROUGE on the DUC-07 test set, roughly in the range of state-of-the-art supervised models.</p><p>6 0.088316016 <a title="150-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Learning_Hierarchical_Translation_Structure_with_Linguistic_Annotations.html">202 acl-2011-Learning Hierarchical Translation Structure with Linguistic Annotations</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuening Hu ; Jordan Boyd-Graber ; Brianna Satinoff</p><p>Abstract: Topic models have been used extensively as a tool for corpus exploration, and a cottage industry has developed to tweak topic models to better encode human intuitions or to better model data. However, creating such extensions requires expertise in machine learning unavailable to potential end-users of topic modeling software. In this work, we develop a framework for allowing users to iteratively refine the topics discovered by models such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) by adding constraints that enforce that sets of words must appear together in the same topic. We incorporate these constraints interactively by selectively removing elements in the state of a Markov Chain used for inference; we investigate a variety of methods for incorporating this information and demonstrate that these interactively added constraints improve topic usefulness for simulated and actual user sessions.</p><p>5 0.60808116 <a title="150-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Knowledge-Based_Weak_Supervision_for_Information_Extraction_of_Overlapping_Relations.html">190 acl-2011-Knowledge-Based Weak Supervision for Information Extraction of Overlapping Relations</a></p>
<p>Author: Raphael Hoffmann ; Congle Zhang ; Xiao Ling ; Luke Zettlemoyer ; Daniel S. Weld</p><p>Abstract: Information extraction (IE) holds the promise of generating a large-scale knowledge base from the Web’s natural language text. Knowledge-based weak supervision, using structured data to heuristically label a training corpus, works towards this goal by enabling the automated learning of a potentially unbounded number of relation extractors. Recently, researchers have developed multiinstance learning algorithms to combat the noisy training data that can come from heuristic labeling, but their models assume relations are disjoint — for example they cannot extract the pair Founded ( Jobs Apple ) and CEO-o f ( Jobs Apple ) . , , This paper presents a novel approach for multi-instance learning with overlapping relations that combines a sentence-level extrac- , tion model with a simple, corpus-level component for aggregating the individual facts. We apply our model to learn extractors for NY Times text using weak supervision from Freebase. Experiments show that the approach runs quickly and yields surprising gains in accuracy, at both the aggregate and sentence level.</p><p>6 0.54903418 <a title="150-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Confidence-Weighted_Learning_of_Factored_Discriminative_Language_Models.html">78 acl-2011-Confidence-Weighted Learning of Factored Discriminative Language Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Dingcheng Li ; Tim Miller ; William Schuler</p><p>Abstract: and Wellner, This paper presents a supervised pronoun anaphora resolution system based on factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs). The basic idea is that the hidden states of FHMMs are an explicit short-term memory with an antecedent buffer containing recently described referents. Thus an observed pronoun can find its antecedent from the hidden buffer, or in terms of a generative model, the entries in the hidden buffer generate the corresponding pronouns. A system implementing this model is evaluated on the ACE corpus with promising performance.</p><p>3 0.59036666 <a title="150-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Extracting_Paraphrases_from_Definition_Sentences_on_the_Web.html">132 acl-2011-Extracting Paraphrases from Definition Sentences on the Web</a></p>

We propose an automatic method of extracting paraphrases from definition sentences, which are also automatically acquired from the Web. We observe that a huge number of concepts are defined in Web documents, and that the sentences that define the same concept tend to convey mostly the same information using different expressions and thus contain many paraphrases. We show that a large number of paraphrases can be automatically extracted with high precision by regarding the sentences that define the same concept as parallel corpora.

<p>Author: Mohit Bansal ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Counts from large corpora (like the web) can be powerful syntactic cues. Past work has used web counts to help resolve isolated ambiguities, such as binary noun-verb PP attachments and noun compound bracketings. In this work, we first present a method for generating web count features that address the full range of syntactic attachments. These features encode both surface evidence of lexical affinities as well as paraphrase-based cues to syntactic structure. We then integrate our features into full-scale dependency and constituent parsers. We show relative error reductions of7.0% over the second-order dependency parser of McDonald and Pereira (2006), 9.2% over the constituent parser of Petrov et al. (2006), and 3.4% over a non-local constituent reranker.</p><p>5 0.54008359 <a title="150-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Automatic_Assessment_of_Coverage_Quality_in_Intelligence_Reports.html">47 acl-2011-Automatic Assessment of Coverage Quality in Intelligence Reports</a></p>

For many real-world applications, deeper notions of quality are needed. This work represents a first step in a project aimed at developing computational methods for deep assessment of quality in the domain of intelligence reports. We present an automated system for ranking intelligence reports with regard to coverage of relevant material. The system employs methodologies from the field of automatic summarization, and achieves performance on a par with human judges, even in the absence of the underlying information sources.</p><p>6 0.51243752 <a title="150-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-A_Cross-Lingual_ILP_Solution_to_Zero_Anaphora_Resolution.html">9 acl-2011-A Cross-Lingual ILP Solution to Zero Anaphora Resolution</a></p>

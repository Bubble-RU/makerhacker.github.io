<p>Author: Patrick Pantel ; Ariel Fuxman</p><p>Abstract: We propose methods for estimating the probability that an entity from an entity database is associated with a web search query. Association is modeled using a query entity click graph, blending general query click logs with vertical query click logs. Smoothing techniques are proposed to address the inherent data sparsity in such graphs, including interpolation using a query synonymy model. A large-scale empirical analysis of the smoothing techniques, over a 2-year click graph collected from a commercial search engine, shows significant reductions in modeling error. The association models are then applied to the task of recommending products to web queries, by annotating queries with products from a large catalog and then mining query- product associations through web search session analysis. Experimental analysis shows that our smoothing techniques improve coverage while keeping precision stable, and overall, that our top-performing model affects 9% of general web queries with 94% precision.</p><p>3 0.2696946 <a title="248-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Search_in_the_Lost_Sense_of_%22Query%22%3A_Question_Formulation_in_Web_Search_Queries_and_its_Temporal_Changes.html">271 acl-2011-Search in the Lost Sense of "Query": Question Formulation in Web Search Queries and its Temporal Changes</a></p>
<p>Author: Bo Pang ; Ravi Kumar</p><p>Abstract: Web search is an information-seeking activity. Often times, this amounts to a user seeking answers to a question. However, queries, which encode user’s information need, are typically not expressed as full-length natural language sentences in particular, as questions. Rather, they consist of one or more text fragments. As humans become more searchengine-savvy, do natural-language questions still have a role to play in web search? Through a systematic, large-scale study, we find to our surprise that as time goes by, web users are more likely to use questions to express their search intent. —</p><p>4 0.10195178 <a title="248-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-SciSumm%3A_A_Multi-Document_Summarization_System_for_Scientific_Articles.html">270 acl-2011-SciSumm: A Multi-Document Summarization System for Scientific Articles</a></p>
<p>Author: Nitin Agarwal ; Ravi Shankar Reddy ; Kiran GVR ; Carolyn Penstein Rose</p><p>Abstract: In this demo, we present SciSumm, an interactive multi-document summarization system for scientific articles. The document collection to be summarized is a list of papers cited together within the same source article, otherwise known as a co-citation. At the heart of the approach is a topic based clustering of fragments extracted from each article based on queries generated from the context surrounding the co-cited list of papers. This analysis enables the generation of an overview of common themes from the co-cited papers that relate to the context in which the co-citation was found. SciSumm is currently built over the 2008 ACL Anthology, however the gen- eralizable nature of the summarization techniques and the extensible architecture makes it possible to use the system with other corpora where a citation network is available. Evaluation results on the same corpus demonstrate that our system performs better than an existing widely used multi-document summarization system (MEAD).</p><p>5 0.083288021 <a title="248-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Learning_to_Grade_Short_Answer_Questions_using_Semantic_Similarity_Measures_and_Dependency_Graph_Alignments.html">205 acl-2011-Learning to Grade Short Answer Questions using Semantic Similarity Measures and Dependency Graph Alignments</a></p>

We combine several graph alignment features with lexical semantic similarity measures using machine learning techniques and show that the student answers can be more accurately graded than if the semantic measures were used in isolation. We also present a first attempt to align the dependency graphs of the student and the instructor answers in order to make use of a structural component in the automatic grading of student answers.</p><p>6 0.078929357 <a title="248-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Interactive_Topic_Modeling.html">178 acl-2011-Interactive Topic Modeling</a></p>

<p>Author: Kirill Kireyev ; Thomas K Landauer</p><p>Abstract: While computational estimation of difficulty of words in the lexicon is useful in many educational and assessment applications, the concept of scalar word difficulty and current corpus-based methods for its estimation are inadequate. We propose a new paradigm called word meaning maturity which tracks the degree of knowledge of each word at different stages of language learning. We present a computational algorithm for estimating word maturity, based on modeling language acquisition with Latent Semantic Analysis. We demonstrate that the resulting metric not only correlates well with external indicators, but captures deeper semantic effects in language. 1 Motivation It is no surprise that through stages of language learning, different words are learned at different times and are known to different extents. For example, a common word like “dog” is familiar to even a first-grader, whereas a more advanced word like “focal” does not usually enter learners’ vocabulary until much later. Although individual rates of learning words may vary between highand low-performing students, it has been observed that “children [… ] acquire word meanings in roughly the same sequence” (Biemiller, 2008). The aim of this work is to model the degree of knowledge of words at different learning stages. Such a metric would have extremely useful applications in personalized educational technologies, for the purposes of accurate assessment and personalized vocabulary instruction. … 299 .l andaue r } @pear s on .com 2 Rethinking Word Difficulty Previously, related work in education and psychometrics has been concerned with measuring word difficulty or classifying words into different difficulty categories. Examples of such approaches include creation of word lists for targeted vocabulary instruction at various grade levels that were compiled by educational experts, such as Nation (1993) or Biemiller (2008). Such word difficulty assignments are also implicitly present in some readability formulas that estimate difficulty of texts, such as Lexiles (Stenner, 1996), which include a lexical difficulty component based on the frequency of occurrence of words in a representative corpus, on the assumption that word difficulty is inversely correlated to corpus frequency. Additionally, research in psycholinguistics has attempted to outline and measure psycholinguistic dimensions of words such as age-of-acquisition and familiarity, which aim to track when certain words become known and how familiar they appear to an average person. Importantly, all such word difficulty measures can be thought of as functions that assign a single scalar value to each word w: !</p><p>4 0.43284366 <a title="248-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-A_Speech-based_Just-in-Time_Retrieval_System_using_Semantic_Search.html">26 acl-2011-A Speech-based Just-in-Time Retrieval System using Semantic Search</a></p>

<p>Author: Paula Carvalho ; Luis Sarmento ; Jorge Teixeira ; Mario J. Silva</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the expression of opinions about human entities in user-generated content (UGC). A set of 2,800 online news comments (8,000 sentences) was manually annotated, following a rich annotation scheme designed for this purpose. We conclude that the challenge in performing opinion mining in such type of content is correctly identifying the positive opinions, because (i) they are much less frequent than negative opinions and (ii) they are particularly exposed to verbal irony. We also show that the recognition of human targets poses additional challenges on mining opinions from UGC, since they are frequently mentioned by pronouns, definite descriptions and nicknames. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.76336819 <a title="248-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Predicting_Clicks_in_a_Vocabulary_Learning_System.html">248 acl-2011-Predicting Clicks in a Vocabulary Learning System</a></p>

This method outperforms the best published method we are aware of on English and a recently published method on Chinese.</p><p>4 0.69182998 <a title="248-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Interactive_Topic_Modeling.html">178 acl-2011-Interactive Topic Modeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuening Hu ; Jordan Boyd-Graber ; Brianna Satinoff</p><p>Abstract: Topic models have been used extensively as a tool for corpus exploration, and a cottage industry has developed to tweak topic models to better encode human intuitions or to better model data. However, creating such extensions requires expertise in machine learning unavailable to potential end-users of topic modeling software. In this work, we develop a framework for allowing users to iteratively refine the topics discovered by models such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) by adding constraints that enforce that sets of words must appear together in the same topic. We incorporate these constraints interactively by selectively removing elements in the state of a Markov Chain used for inference; we investigate a variety of methods for incorporating this information and demonstrate that these interactively added constraints improve topic usefulness for simulated and actual user sessions.</p><p>5 0.64819646 <a title="248-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Better_Automatic_Treebank_Conversion_Using_A_Feature-Based_Approach.html">59 acl-2011-Better Automatic Treebank Conversion Using A Feature-Based Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Muhua Zhu ; Jingbo Zhu ; Minghan Hu</p><p>Abstract: For the task of automatic treebank conversion, this paper presents a feature-based approach which encodes bracketing structures in a treebank into features to guide the conversion of this treebank to a different standard. Experiments on two Chinese treebanks show that our approach improves conversion accuracy by 1.31% over a strong baseline.</p><p>6 0.63827813 <a title="248-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Towards_Tracking_Semantic_Change_by_Visual_Analytics.html">307 acl-2011-Towards Tracking Semantic Change by Visual Analytics</a></p>

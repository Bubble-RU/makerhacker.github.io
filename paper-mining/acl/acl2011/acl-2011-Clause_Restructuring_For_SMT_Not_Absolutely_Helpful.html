<p>Author: Zhanyi Liu ; Haifeng Wang ; Hua Wu ; Ting Liu ; Sheng Li</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel reordering model for statistical machine translation (SMT) by means of modeling the translation orders of the source language collocations. The model is learned from a word-aligned bilingual corpus where the collocated words in source sentences are automatically detected. During decoding, the model is employed to softly constrain the translation orders of the source language collocations, so as to constrain the translation orders of those source phrases containing these collocated words. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the translation quality, achieving the absolute improvements of 1.1~1.4 BLEU score over the baseline methods. 1</p><p>3 0.19028945 <a title="69-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Reordering_Constraint_Based_on_Document-Level_Context.html">263 acl-2011-Reordering Constraint Based on Document-Level Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Takashi Onishi ; Masao Utiyama ; Eiichiro Sumita</p><p>Abstract: One problem with phrase-based statistical machine translation is the problem of longdistance reordering when translating between languages with different word orders, such as Japanese-English. In this paper, we propose a method of imposing reordering constraints using document-level context. As the documentlevel context, we use noun phrases which significantly occur in context documents containing source sentences. Given a source sentence, zones which cover the noun phrases are used as reordering constraints. Then, in decoding, reorderings which violate the zones are restricted. Experiment results for patent translation tasks show a significant improvement of 1.20% BLEU points in JapaneseEnglish translation and 1.41% BLEU points in English-Japanese translation.</p><p>4 0.18120241 <a title="69-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-A_Joint_Sequence_Translation_Model_with_Integrated_Reordering.html">16 acl-2011-A Joint Sequence Translation Model with Integrated Reordering</a></p>
<p>Author: Nadir Durrani ; Helmut Schmid ; Alexander Fraser</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel machine translation model which models translation by a linear sequence of operations. In contrast to the “N-gram” model, this sequence includes not only translation but also reordering operations. Key ideas of our model are (i) a new reordering approach which better restricts the position to which a word or phrase can be moved, and is able to handle short and long distance reorderings in a unified way, and (ii) a joint sequence model for the translation and reordering probabilities which is more flexible than standard phrase-based MT. We observe statistically significant improvements in BLEU over Moses for German-to-English and Spanish-to-English tasks, and comparable results for a French-to-English task.</p><p>5 0.15615427 <a title="69-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Reordering_Metrics_for_MT.html">264 acl-2011-Reordering Metrics for MT</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexandra Birch ; Miles Osborne</p><p>Abstract: One of the major challenges facing statistical machine translation is how to model differences in word order between languages. Although a great deal of research has focussed on this problem, progress is hampered by the lack of reliable metrics. Most current metrics are based on matching lexical items in the translation and the reference, and their ability to measure the quality of word order has not been demonstrated. This paper presents a novel metric, the LRscore, which explicitly measures the quality of word order by using permutation distance metrics. We show that the metric is more consistent with human judgements than other metrics, including the BLEU score. We also show that the LRscore can successfully be used as the objective function when training translation model parameters. Training with the LRscore leads to output which is preferred by humans. Moreover, the translations incur no penalty in terms of BLEU scores.</p><p>6 0.14557184 <a title="69-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Learning_Hierarchical_Translation_Structure_with_Linguistic_Annotations.html">202 acl-2011-Learning Hierarchical Translation Structure with Linguistic Annotations</a></p>

<p>Author: Xianchao Wu ; Takuya Matsuzaki ; Jun'ichi Tsujii</p><p>Abstract: In the present paper, we propose the effective usage of function words to generate generalized translation rules for forest-based translation. Given aligned forest-string pairs, we extract composed tree-to-string translation rules that account for multiple interpretations of both aligned and unaligned target function words. In order to constrain the exhaustive attachments of function words, we limit to bind them to the nearby syntactic chunks yielded by a target dependency parser. Therefore, the proposed approach can not only capture source-tree-to-target-chunk correspondences but can also use forest structures that compactly encode an exponential number of parse trees to properly generate target function words during decoding. Extensive experiments involving large-scale English-toJapanese translation revealed a significant im- provement of 1.8 points in BLEU score, as compared with a strong forest-to-string baseline system.</p><p>5 0.5589121 <a title="69-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Adjoining_Tree-to-String_Translation.html">30 acl-2011-Adjoining Tree-to-String Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yang Liu ; Qun Liu ; Yajuan Lu</p><p>Abstract: We introduce synchronous tree adjoining grammars (TAG) into tree-to-string translation, which converts a source tree to a target string. Without reconstructing TAG derivations explicitly, our rule extraction algorithm directly learns tree-to-string rules from aligned Treebank-style trees. As tree-to-string translation casts decoding as a tree parsing problem rather than parsing, the decoder still runs fast when adjoining is included. Less than 2 times slower, the adjoining tree-tostring system improves translation quality by +0.7 BLEU over the baseline system only allowing for tree substitution on NIST ChineseEnglish test sets.</p><p>6 0.55751073 <a title="69-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Pre-_and_Postprocessing_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation_into_Germanic_Languages.html">247 acl-2011-Pre- and Postprocessing for Statistical Machine Translation into Germanic Languages</a></p>

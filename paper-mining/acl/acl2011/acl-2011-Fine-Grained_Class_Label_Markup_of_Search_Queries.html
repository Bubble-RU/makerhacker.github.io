<p>Author: Peng Cai ; Wei Gao ; Aoying Zhou ; Kam-Fai Wong</p><p>Abstract: We propose to directly measure the importance of queries in the source domain to the target domain where no rank labels of documents are available, which is referred to as query weighting. Query weighting is a key step in ranking model adaptation. As the learning object of ranking algorithms is divided by query instances, we argue that it’s more reasonable to conduct importance weighting at query level than document level. We present two query weighting schemes. The first compresses the query into a query feature vector, which aggregates all document instances in the same query, and then conducts query weighting based on the query feature vector. This method can efficiently estimate query importance by compressing query data, but the potential risk is information loss resulted from the compression. The second measures the similarity between the source query and each target query, and then combines these fine-grained similarity values for its importance estimation. Adaptation experiments on LETOR3.0 data set demonstrate that query weighting significantly outperforms document instance weighting methods.</p><p>5 0.38498932 <a title="137-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Search_in_the_Lost_Sense_of_%22Query%22%3A_Question_Formulation_in_Web_Search_Queries_and_its_Temporal_Changes.html">271 acl-2011-Search in the Lost Sense of "Query": Question Formulation in Web Search Queries and its Temporal Changes</a></p>
<p>Author: Bo Pang ; Ravi Kumar</p><p>Abstract: Web search is an information-seeking activity. Often times, this amounts to a user seeking answers to a question. However, queries, which encode user’s information need, are typically not expressed as full-length natural language sentences in particular, as questions. Rather, they consist of one or more text fragments. As humans become more searchengine-savvy, do natural-language questions still have a role to play in web search? Through a systematic, large-scale study, we find to our surprise that as time goes by, web users are more likely to use questions to express their search intent. —</p><p>6 0.31537437 <a title="137-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Jigs_and_Lures%3A_Associating_Web_Queries_with_Structured_Entities.html">181 acl-2011-Jigs and Lures: Associating Web Queries with Structured Entities</a></p>

<p>Author: Percy Liang ; Michael Jordan ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Compositional question answering begins by mapping questions to logical forms, but training a semantic parser to perform this mapping typically requires the costly annotation of the target logical forms. In this paper, we learn to map questions to answers via latent logical forms, which are induced automatically from question-answer pairs. In tackling this challenging learning problem, we introduce a new semantic representation which highlights a parallel between dependency syntax and efficient evaluation of logical forms. On two standard semantic parsing benchmarks (GEO and JOBS), our system obtains the highest published accuracies, despite requiring no annotated logical forms.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.86402643 <a title="137-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Fine-Grained_Class_Label_Markup_of_Search_Queries.html">137 acl-2011-Fine-Grained Class Label Markup of Search Queries</a></p>

Then, we stack additional classifiers on the independent annotations, and exploit the dependencies between them to further improve the accuracy, even with a very limited amount of available training data. We evaluate our method using a range of queries extracted from a web search log. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our approach for both short keyword queries, and verbose natural language queries.</p><p>4 0.83895737 <a title="137-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Event_Discovery_in_Social_Media_Feeds.html">121 acl-2011-Event Discovery in Social Media Feeds</a></p>
<p>Author: Edward Benson ; Aria Haghighi ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method for record extraction from social streams such as Twitter. Unlike typical extraction setups, these environments are characterized by short, one sentence messages with heavily colloquial speech. To further complicate matters, individual messages may not express the full relation to be uncovered, as is often assumed in extraction tasks. We develop a graphical model that addresses these problems by learning a latent set of records and a record-message alignment simultaneously; the output of our model is a set of canonical records, the values of which are consistent with aligned messages. We demonstrate that our approach is able to accurately induce event records from Twitter messages, evaluated against events from a local city guide. Our method achieves significant error reduction over baseline methods.1</p><p>5 0.83748442 <a title="137-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-A_Corpus_of_Scope-disambiguated_English_Text.html">8 acl-2011-A Corpus of Scope-disambiguated English Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Mehdi Manshadi ; James Allen ; Mary Swift</p><p>Abstract: Previous work on quantifier scope annotation focuses on scoping sentences with only two quantified noun phrases (NPs), where the quantifiers are restricted to a predefined list. It also ignores negation, modal/logical operators, and other sentential adverbials. We present a comprehensive scope annotation scheme. We annotate the scope interaction between all scopal terms in the sentence from quantifiers to scopal adverbials, without putting any restriction on the number of scopal terms in a sentence. In addition, all NPs, explicitly quantified or not, with no restriction on the type of quantification, are investigated for possible scope interactions. 1</p><p>6 0.83457321 <a title="137-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-A_Stacked_Sub-Word_Model_for_Joint_Chinese_Word_Segmentation_and_Part-of-Speech_Tagging.html">27 acl-2011-A Stacked Sub-Word Model for Joint Chinese Word Segmentation and Part-of-Speech Tagging</a></p>

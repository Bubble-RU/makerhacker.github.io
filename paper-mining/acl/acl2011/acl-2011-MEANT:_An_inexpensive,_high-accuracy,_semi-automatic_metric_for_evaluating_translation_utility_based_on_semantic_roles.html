</p><p>9 1  Introduction  In this paper we show that evaluating machine translation by assessing the translation accuracy of each argument in the semantic role framework correlates with human judgment on translation adequacy as well as HTER, at a significantly lower labor cost. [sent-12, score-1.701]
</p><p>10 The correlation of this new metric, MEANT, with human judgment is far superior to BLEU and other automatic n-gram based evaluaWe argue that BLEU (Papineni et al. [sent-13, score-0.425]
</p><p>11 , 2002) and other automatic n-gram based MT evaluation metrics do not adequately capture the similarity in meaning between the machine translation andthe reference translation—which, ultimately, is essential for MT output to be useful. [sent-14, score-0.784]
</p><p>12 (2006) and Koehn and Monz (2006) report cases where BLEU strongly disagree with human judgment on translation quality. [sent-17, score-0.48]
</p><p>13 Instead, with MEANT, we adopt at the outset the principle that a good translation is one that is useful, in the sense that human readers may successfully understand at least the basic event structure—“who did what to whom, when, where and why” (Pradhan et al. [sent-24, score-0.408]

</p><p>15 We present the results of evaluating translation utility by measuring the accuracy within a semantic role labeling (SRL) framework. [sent-33, score-0.667]
</p><p>16 We show empirically that our proposed SRL based evaluation metric, which uses untrained monolingual humans to annotate semantic frames in MT output, correlates with human adequacyjudgments as well as HTER, and far better than BLEU and other commonly used metrics. [sent-34, score-0.739]
</p><p>17 , 2006; Koehn and Monz, 2006) report cases where it strongly disagree with human judgment on translation accuracy. [sent-38, score-0.48]
</p><p>18 We argue that a translation metric that reflects meaning similarity is better based on similarity in semantic structure, rather than simply flat lexical similarity. [sent-45, score-0.762]
</p><p>19 (2006) shows a high correlation with human  judgment on translation adequacy, it is not widely used in day-to-day machine translation evaluation because of its high labor cost. [sent-47, score-1.013]
</p><p>20 HTER not only requires human experts to understand the meaning expressed in both the reference translation and the machine translation, but also rethe MT output such that the post-edited MT output conveys the same meaning as the reference translation. [sent-48, score-0.877]
</p><p>21 To reduce the cost of evaluation, we aim to reduce any human decisions in the evaluation cycle to be as simple as possible, such that even untrained humans can quickly complete the evaluation. [sent-50, score-0.318]
</p><p>22 They evaluated only whether the role fillers were correctly identified, without checking whether the roles were appropriately attached to the correct predicate. [sent-54, score-0.512]
</p><p>23 Syntax based metrics Unlike Voss and Tate, Liu and Gildea (2005) proposed a structural approach, but it was based on syntactic rather than semantic structure, and focused on checking the correctness of the role structure without checking the correctness of the role fillers. [sent-57, score-0.632]
</p><p>24 Their subtree metric (STM) and headword chain metric (HWC) address the failure of BLEU to evaluate translation grammaticality; however, the problem remains that a grammatical translation can achieve a high syntax-based score even if contains meaning errors arising from confusion of semantic roles. [sent-58, score-1.046]
</p><p>25 STM was the first proposed metric to incorporate syntactic features in MT evaluation, and STM underlies most other recently proposed syntactic MT evaluation met-  rics, for example the evaluation metric based on lexicalfunctional grammar of Owczarzak et al. [sent-59, score-0.418]
</p><p>26 STM is a precision-based metric that measures what fraction of quires them to propose the minimum number of edits to221 subtree structures  are shared between the parse trees of  machine translations and reference translations (averaging over subtrees up to some depth threshold). [sent-61, score-0.385]
</p><p>27 Unlike Voss and Tate, however, STM does not check whether the role fillers are correctly translated. [sent-62, score-0.373]
</p><p>28 Moreover, properly measuring translation utility requires verifying whether role fillers have been correctly translated—verifying only the abstract structures fails to penalize when role fillers are confused. [sent-69, score-1.034]
</p><p>29 Although the metric shows an improved correlation with human judgment of translation quality (Callison-Burch et al. [sent-72, score-0.793]
</p><p>30 Specifically, note that the feature based representations of semantic roles used in these aggregate metrics do not actually capture the structural predicate-argument relations. [sent-75, score-0.393]
</p><p>31 “Semantic structure overlapping” can be seen as the shallow semantic version of STM: it only measures the similarity of the tree structure of the semantic roles, without considering the lexical realization. [sent-76, score-0.431]
</p><p>32 “Semantic role overlapping” calculates the degree of lexical overlap between semantic roles of the same type in the machine translation and its reference translation, using simple bagof-words counting; this is then aggregated into an average  over all semantic role types. [sent-77, score-1.178]
</p><p>33 3  MEANT: SRL for MT evaluation  A good translation is one from which human readers may successfully understand at least the basic event structure—“who did what to whom, when, where and why” (Pradhan et al. [sent-87, score-0.46]
</p><p>34 First, semantic role labeling is performed (either manually or automatically) on both the reference translation and the machine translation. [sent-90, score-0.694]
</p><p>35 The semantic frame structures thus obtained for the MT output are compared to those in the reference translations, frame by frame, argument by argument. [sent-91, score-0.546]
</p><p>36 The frame translation accuracy is a weighted sum of the number of correctly translated arguments. [sent-92, score-0.37]
</p><p>37 Conceptually, MEANT is defined in terms of f-score, with respect to the precision/recall for sentence translation accuracy as calculated by averaging the translation accuracy for all frames in the MT output across the number of frames in the MT output/reference translations. [sent-93, score-0.936]
</p><p>38 1 Annotating semantic frames  In designing a semantic MT evaluation metric, one important issue that should be addressed is how to evaluate act string match. [sent-96, score-0.555]
</p><p>39 Following Propbank, there are no semantic frames  for MT3 because there is no predicate. [sent-98, score-0.347]
</p><p>40 Figure 1 shows the reference translation with reconstructed semantic frames in Propbank format and the corresponding MT output with reconstructed semantic frames by minimal trained human annotators. [sent-101, score-1.38]
</p><p>41 2 Comparing semantic frames After annotating the semantic frames, we must determine the translation accuracy for each semantic role filler in the reference and machine translations. [sent-103, score-1.273]
</p><p>42 Although ultimately it would be nice to do this automatically, it is es-  sential to first understand extremely well the upper bound of accuracy for MT evaluation via semantic frame theory. [sent-104, score-0.341]
</p><p>43 In order to facilitate a finer-grained measurement of utility, the human judges were not only allowed to mark each role filler translation as “correct” or “incorrect”, but also “partial”. [sent-106, score-0.634]
</p><p>44 Translations of role fillers are judged “correct” ifthey express the same meaning as that ofthe reference translations (or the original source input, in the bilinguals experiment discussed later). [sent-107, score-0.828]
</p><p>45 Extra meaning in a role filler is not penalized wrongly translated predicate means that the entire semantic frame is incorrect; therefore, the “correct” and “partial” argument counts are collected only iftheir associated predicate is correctly translated in the first place. [sent-109, score-0.821]
</p><p>46 Table 1 shows an example of SRL annotation of MT1 in Figure 1by one ofthe annotators, along with the human judgment on translation accuracy of each argument. [sent-110, score-0.48]
</p><p>47 The predicate ceased in the reference translation did not match with any predicate annotated in MT1, while the predicate resumed matched with the predicate resume annotated in  MT1. [sent-111, score-0.624]
</p><p>48 The ARGM-TMP argument, Until after their sales had ceased in mainland China for almost two months, in the reference translation is partially translated to ARGM-TMP argument, So far , nearly two months, in MT1. [sent-113, score-0.435]
</p><p>49 Similar decisions are made for the ARG1 argument and the other ARGM-TMP argument; now in the reference translation is missing in MT1. [sent-114, score-0.391]
</p><p>50 3 Quantifying semantic frame match To quantify the above in a summary metric, we define MEANT in terms of an f-score that balances the precision and recall analysis of the comparative matrices collected from the human judges, as follows. [sent-116, score-0.327]
</p><p>51 Ci,j Pi,j Mi,j  = = =  # correct fillers of ARG j for PRED iin MT # partial fillers of ARG j for PRED iin MT total # fillers of ARG j for PRED iin MT  unless it belongs in another role. [sent-117, score-0.72]
</p><p>52 The number of frames in MT1 and the reference translation are 1 and 2, respectively. [sent-127, score-0.54]
</p><p>53 Assuming for now that the metric aggregates ten types of semantic roles with uniform weight for each role (optimization of weights will be discussed later), then wpred = wj = 0. [sent-129, score-0.675]
</p><p>54 Both human and semi-automatic variants of the MEANT translation evaluation metric were meta-  evaluated, as described next. [sent-138, score-0.535]
</p><p>55 5 of the DARPA GALE program in which both a subset of the Chinese source sentences, as well as their English reference, are being annotated with semantic role labels in Propbank style. [sent-141, score-0.345]
</p><p>56 A higher value for τ indicates more similarity to the ranking by the evaluation metric to the human  judgment. [sent-148, score-0.349]
</p><p>57 The range of possible values of correlation coin both MT1 and the reference translation is 4 (one pred2-24efficient is [-1,1], where 1 means the systems are  ranked  Table 2: List of semantic roles that human judges are requested to label. [sent-149, score-0.924]
</p><p>58 h wEo hvw yernt  in the same order as the human judgment and -1 means the systems are ranked in the reverse order as the human judgment. [sent-151, score-0.316]
</p><p>59 5  Experiment: Using human SRL  The first experiment aims to provide a more concrete understanding of one of the key questions as to the upper bounds of the proposed evaluation metric: how well can human annotators perform in reconstructing the semantic frames in MT output? [sent-152, score-0.672]
</p><p>60 This is important since MT output is still not close to perfectly grammatical for a good syntactic parsing—applying automatic shallow semantic parsers, which are trained on grammatical input and valid syntactic parse trees, on MT output may significantly underestimate translation utility. [sent-153, score-0.623]
</p><p>61 1 Experimental setup We thus introduce HMEANT, a variant of MEANT based on the idea that semantic role labeling can be simplified into a task that is easy and fast even for untrained humans. [sent-155, score-0.418]
</p><p>62 Table 2 shows the list of labels annotators are requested to annotate, where the semantic role labeling instructions are given in the intuitive terms of “who did what to whom, when, where, why and how”. [sent-157, score-0.499]
</p><p>63 After calculating the SRL scores based on the confusion matrix collected from the annotation and evaluation, we estimate the weights using grid search to optimize correlation with human adequacy judgments. [sent-159, score-0.456]
</p><p>64 2 Results: Correlation with human judgement Table 3 shows results indicating that HMEANT correlates with human judgment on adequacy as well as HTER does (0. [sent-161, score-0.546]
</p><p>65 Recall that the weights used in HMEANT are Table 3: Sentence-level correlation with human adequacy judg-  ments, across the evaluation metrics. [sent-165, score-0.473]
</p><p>66 The average time used for annotating each sentence was lower bounded by 2 minutes and upper bounded by 3 minutes, and the time used for determing the translation accuracy of role fillers averaged under 2 minutes. [sent-190, score-0.653]
</p><p>67 bilinguals  We now show that using monolingual annotators is essentially just as effective as using more expensive bilingual annotators. [sent-194, score-0.354]
</p><p>68 1 Experimental Setup Both English monolinguals and Chinese-English bilinguals (Chinese as first language and English as second language) were employed to annotate the semantic roles. [sent-201, score-0.494]
</p><p>69 Therefore, there are three variations in the experiment setup: monolinguals seeing translation output only; bilinguals seeing translation output only; and bilinguals seeing both input and output. [sent-203, score-1.309]
</p><p>70 (The correlation scores reported in this section are thus expected to be lower than that reported in Table 5: Sentence-level correlation with human adequacy judgments, for monolinguals vs. [sent-206, score-0.712]
</p><p>71 2  Results  Table 5 of our results shows that using more expensive bilinguals for SRL annotation instead of monolinguals improves the correlation only slightly. [sent-211, score-0.494]
</p><p>72 The correlation coefficient of the SRL based evaluation metric driven by bilingual human annotators (0. [sent-212, score-0.639]
</p><p>73 The results show that even allowing the bilinguals to see the input as well as the translation output for SRL annotation does not help the correlation. [sent-215, score-0.512]
</p><p>74 The correlation coefficient of the SRL based evaluation metric driven by bilingual human annotators who see also the source input sentences is 0. [sent-216, score-0.639]
</p><p>75 We find that the correlation coefficient of the proposed with human judgment on adequacy drops when bilinguals are shown to the source input sentence during annotation. [sent-218, score-0.82]
</p><p>76 7  Inter-annotator agreement  One of the concerns of the proposed metric is that, given only minimal training on the task, humans would annotate the semantic roles so inconsistently as to reduce the reliability of the evaluation metric. [sent-221, score-0.608]
</p><p>77 To obtain a clear analysis on where any inconsistency might lie, we measured IAA in two steps: role identification and role classification. [sent-224, score-0.378]
</p><p>78 Pidentification  =  Ridentification  =  MAsp1an MAsp2an  IAAidentification  =  2P ∗id Peintdiefinctiafitcioanti+on∗ R Rideidnteifnitcifaictioantion  Role classification The agreement of classified roles is counted over the matching of the semantic role labels within two aligned word spans. [sent-231, score-0.572]
</p><p>79 Mlabel denotes the number of annotated predicates and arguments with matching role label between annotators. [sent-233, score-0.342]
</p><p>80 Table 6 and 7 show the annotators reconstructed the semantic frames quite consistently, even they were given only simple and minimal We have noticed that the agreement on role identification is higher than that on role classification. [sent-236, score-0.97]
</p><p>81 We expect a slightly more detailed instructions and explanations on different roles will further improve the IAA on role classification. [sent-238, score-0.371]
</p><p>82 The results also show that monolinguals seeing output only have the highest IAA in semantic frame reconstruction. [sent-239, score-0.495]
</p><p>83 Therefore, they all understand the translation almost the same way, even if the translation is incorrect. [sent-242, score-0.533]
</p><p>84 8  Experiment: Using automatic SRL  In the previous experiment, we showed that the proposed evaluation metric driven by human semantic role annotators performed as well as HTER. [sent-247, score-0.82]
</p><p>85 It is now worth asking a deeper question: can we further reduce the labor cost of MEANT by using automatic shallow semantic parsing instead of humans for semantic role labeling? [sent-248, score-0.787]
</p><p>86 For SRL annotation, we replace humans with automatic shallow semantic parsing. [sent-250, score-0.316]
</p><p>87 However, we believe the evaluation of role filler accuracy will also be automatable. [sent-252, score-0.317]

</p><p>90 2  Results  Table 8 shows that the proposed SRL based evaluation metric correlates slightly worse than HTER with a much lower labor cost. [sent-261, score-0.335]

</p><p>92 , applying ASSERT on both the reference translation and the MT output, of the SRL based evaluation metric is about 80% of that of HTER. [sent-264, score-0.558]
</p><p>93 The results also show that the correlation with human judgment on adequacy of either one side of translation using automatic SRL is in the 85% to 95% range of that HTER. [sent-265, score-0.854]
</p><p>94 9  Conclusion  We have presented MEANT, a novel semantic MT evaluation metric that assesses the translation accuracy via Propbank-style semantic predicates, roles, and fillers. [sent-266, score-0.766]
</p><p>95 MEANT canbe run using inexpensive untrained monolinguals and yet correlates with human judgments on adequacy as well as HTER with a lower labor cost. [sent-268, score-0.643]
</p><p>96 In contrast to HTER, which requires rigorous training of human experts to find a minimum edit ofthe translation (an exponentially large search space), MEANT requires untrained humans to make well-defined, bounded decisions on annotating semantic roles and judging translation correctness. [sent-269, score-1.005]
</p><p>97 The process by which MEANT reconstructs the semantic frames in a translation and then judges translation correctness of the role fillers conceptually models how humans read and understand translation output. [sent-270, score-1.607]
</p><p>98 We also showed that using automatic shallow semantic parser to further reduce the labor cost of the proposed metric successfully approximates roughly 80% of the correlation with human judgment on adequacy. [sent-271, score-0.924]
</p><p>99 A further investigation into the correlation of each of the in-  dividual roles to human adequacy judgments is detailed elsewhere, along with additional improvements to the MEANT family of metrics (Lo and Wu, 2011). [sent-274, score-0.702]

<p>Author: Chi-kiu Lo ; Dekai Wu</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel semi-automated metric, MEANT, that assesses translation utility by matching semantic role fillers, producing scores that correlate with human judgment as well as HTER but at much lower labor cost. As machine translation systems improve in lexical choice and fluency, the shortcomings of widespread n-gram based, fluency-oriented MT evaluation metrics such as BLEU, which fail to properly evaluate adequacy, become more apparent. But more accurate, nonautomatic adequacy-oriented MT evaluation metrics like HTER are highly labor-intensive, which bottlenecks the evaluation cycle. We first show that when using untrained monolingual readers to annotate semantic roles in MT output, the non-automatic version of the metric HMEANT achieves a 0.43 correlation coefficient with human adequacyjudgments at the sentence level, far superior to BLEU at only 0.20, and equal to the far more expensive HTER. We then replace the human semantic role annotators with automatic shallow semantic parsing to further automate the evaluation metric, and show that even the semiautomated evaluation metric achieves a 0.34 correlation coefficient with human adequacy judgment, which is still about 80% as closely correlated as HTER despite an even lower labor cost for the evaluation procedure. The results show that our proposed metric is significantly better correlated with human judgment on adequacy than current widespread automatic evaluation metrics, while being much more cost effective than HTER. 1</p><p>2 0.27506888 <a title="216-tfidf-2" href="./acl-2011-AM-FM%3A_A_Semantic_Framework_for_Translation_Quality_Assessment.html">2 acl-2011-AM-FM: A Semantic Framework for Translation Quality Assessment</a></p>
<p>Author: Rafael E. Banchs ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: This work introduces AM-FM, a semantic framework for machine translation evaluation. Based upon this framework, a new evaluation metric, which is able to operate without the need for reference translations, is implemented and evaluated. The metric is based on the concepts of adequacy and fluency, which are independently assessed by using a cross-language latent semantic indexing approach and an n-gram based language model approach, respectively. Comparative analyses with conventional evaluation metrics are conducted on two different evaluation tasks (overall quality assessment and comparative ranking) over a large collection of human evaluations involving five European languages. Finally, the main pros and cons of the proposed framework are discussed along with future research directions. 1</p><p>3 0.23809384 <a title="216-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Automatic_Evaluation_of_Chinese_Translation_Output%3A_Word-Level_or_Character-Level%3F.html">49 acl-2011-Automatic Evaluation of Chinese Translation Output: Word-Level or Character-Level?</a></p>
<p>Author: Maoxi Li ; Chengqing Zong ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: Word is usually adopted as the smallest unit in most tasks of Chinese language processing. However, for automatic evaluation of the quality of Chinese translation output when translating from other languages, either a word-level approach or a character-level approach is possible. So far, there has been no detailed study to compare the correlations of these two approaches with human assessment. In this paper, we compare word-level metrics with characterlevel metrics on the submitted output of English-to-Chinese translation systems in the IWSLT’08 CT-EC and NIST’08 EC tasks. Our experimental results reveal that character-level metrics correlate with human assessment better than word-level metrics. Our analysis suggests several key reasons behind this finding. 1</p><p>4 0.22424914 <a title="216-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Corpus_Expansion_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation_with_Semantic_Role_Label_Substitution_Rules.html">87 acl-2011-Corpus Expansion for Statistical Machine Translation with Semantic Role Label Substitution Rules</a></p>
<p>Author: Qin Gao ; Stephan Vogel</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach of expanding parallel corpora for machine translation. By utilizing Semantic role labeling (SRL) on one side of the language pair, we extract SRL substitution rules from existing parallel corpus. The rules are then used for generating new sentence pairs. An SVM classifier is built to filter the generated sentence pairs. The filtered corpus is used for training phrase-based translation models, which can be used directly in translation tasks or combined with baseline models. Experimental results on ChineseEnglish machine translation tasks show an average improvement of 0.45 BLEU and 1.22 TER points across 5 different NIST test sets.</p><p>5 0.17932349 <a title="216-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Goodness%3A_A_Method_for_Measuring_Machine_Translation_Confidence.html">146 acl-2011-Goodness: A Method for Measuring Machine Translation Confidence</a></p>
<p>Author: Nguyen Bach ; Fei Huang ; Yaser Al-Onaizan</p><p>Abstract: State-of-the-art statistical machine translation (MT) systems have made significant progress towards producing user-acceptable translation output. However, there is still no efficient way for MT systems to inform users which words are likely translated correctly and how confident it is about the whole sentence. We propose a novel framework to predict wordlevel and sentence-level MT errors with a large number of novel features. Experimental results show that the MT error prediction accuracy is increased from 69.1 to 72.2 in F-score. The Pearson correlation between the proposed confidence measure and the human-targeted translation edit rate (HTER) is 0.6. Improve- ments between 0.4 and 0.9 TER reduction are obtained with the n-best list reranking task using the proposed confidence measure. Also, we present a visualization prototype of MT errors at the word and sentence levels with the objective to improve post-editor productivity.</p><p>6 0.17778578 <a title="216-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Unsupervised_Semantic_Role_Induction_via_Split-Merge_Clustering.html">324 acl-2011-Unsupervised Semantic Role Induction via Split-Merge Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Omar F. Zaidan ; Chris Callison-Burch</p><p>Abstract: Naively collecting translations by crowdsourcing the task to non-professional translators yields disfluent, low-quality results if no quality control is exercised. We demonstrate a variety of mechanisms that increase the translation quality to near professional levels. Specifically, we solicit redundant translations and edits to them, and automatically select the best output among them. We propose a set of features that model both the translations and the translators, such as country of residence, LM perplexity of the translation, edit rate from the other translations, and (optionally) calibration against professional translators. Using these features to score the collected translations, we are able to discriminate between acceptable and unacceptable translations. We recreate the NIST 2009 Urdu-toEnglish evaluation set with Mechanical Turk, and quantitatively show that our models are able to select translations within the range of quality that we expect from professional trans- lators. The total cost is more than an order of magnitude lower than professional translation.</p><p>4 0.69216943 <a title="216-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Blast%3A_A_Tool_for_Error_Analysis_of_Machine_Translation_Output.html">62 acl-2011-Blast: A Tool for Error Analysis of Machine Translation Output</a></p>

A set of 2,800 online news comments (8,000 sentences) was manually annotated, following a rich annotation scheme designed for this purpose. We conclude that the challenge in performing opinion mining in such type of content is correctly identifying the positive opinions, because (i) they are much less frequent than negative opinions and (ii) they are particularly exposed to verbal irony. We also show that the recognition of human targets poses additional challenges on mining opinions from UGC, since they are frequently mentioned by pronouns, definite descriptions and nicknames. 1</p><p>2 0.93633783 <a title="216-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Underspecifying_and_Predicting_Voice_for_Surface_Realisation_Ranking.html">317 acl-2011-Underspecifying and Predicting Voice for Surface Realisation Ranking</a></p>

We investigate the relationship between the surface realisation performance and the character of the input to generation, i.e. its degree of underspecification. We extend a syntactic surface realisation system, which can be trained to choose among word order variants, such that the candidate set includes active and passive variants. This allows us to study the interaction of voice and word order alternations in realistic German corpus data. We show that with an appropriately underspecified input, a linguistically informed realisation model trained to regenerate strings from the underlying semantic representation achieves 91.5% accuracy (over a baseline of 82.5%) in the prediction of the original voice. 1</p><p>3 0.84893358 <a title="216-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Combining_Morpheme-based_Machine_Translation_with_Post-processing_Morpheme_Prediction.html">75 acl-2011-Combining Morpheme-based Machine Translation with Post-processing Morpheme Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Ann Clifton ; Anoop Sarkar</p><p>Abstract: This paper extends the training and tuning regime for phrase-based statistical machine translation to obtain fluent translations into morphologically complex languages (we build an English to Finnish translation system) . Our methods use unsupervised morphology induction. Unlike previous work we focus on morphologically productive phrase pairs – our decoder can combine morphemes across phrase boundaries. Morphemes in the target language may not have a corresponding morpheme or word in the source language. Therefore, we propose a novel combination of post-processing morphology prediction with morpheme-based translation. We show, using both automatic evaluation scores and linguistically motivated analyses of the output, that our methods outperform previously proposed ones and pro- vide the best known results on the EnglishFinnish Europarl translation task. Our methods are mostly language independent, so they should improve translation into other target languages with complex morphology. 1 Translation and Morphology Languages with rich morphological systems present significant hurdles for statistical machine translation (SMT) , most notably data sparsity, source-target asymmetry, and problems with automatic evaluation. In this work, we propose to address the problem of morphological complexity in an Englishto-Finnish MT task within a phrase-based translation framework. We focus on unsupervised segmentation methods to derive the morphological information supplied to the MT model in order to provide coverage on very large datasets and for languages with few hand-annotated 32 resources. In fact, in our experiments, unsupervised morphology always outperforms the use of a hand-built morphological analyzer. Rather than focusing on a few linguistically motivated aspects of Finnish morphological behaviour, we develop techniques for handling morphological complexity in general. We chose Finnish as our target language for this work, because it exemplifies many of the problems morphologically complex languages present for SMT. Among all the languages in the Europarl data-set, Finnish is the most difficult language to translate from and into, as was demonstrated in the MT Summit shared task (Koehn, 2005) . Another reason is the current lack of knowledge about how to apply SMT successfully to agglutinative languages like Turkish or Finnish. Our main contributions are: 1) the introduction of the notion of segmented translation where we explicitly allow phrase pairs that can end with a dangling morpheme, which can connect with other morphemes as part of the translation process, and 2) the use of a fully segmented translation model in combination with a post-processing morpheme prediction system, using unsupervised morphology induction. Both of these approaches beat the state of the art on the English-Finnish translation task. Morphology can express both content and function categories, and our experiments show that it is important to use morphology both within the translation model (for morphology with content) and outside it (for morphology contributing to fluency) . Automatic evaluation measures for MT, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), WER (Word Error Rate) and PER (Position Independent Word Error Rate) use the word as the basic unit rather than morphemes.

In addition to standard MT evaluation measures, we perform a detailed linguistic analysis of the output. Our proposed approaches are significantly better than the state of the art, achieving the highest reported BLEU scores on the English-Finnish Europarl version 3 data-set. Our linguistic analysis shows that our models have fewer morpho-syntactic errors compared to the word-based baseline. 2 2.1 Models Baseline Models We set up three baseline models for comparison in this work. The first is a basic wordbased model (called Baseline in the results) ; we trained this on the original unsegmented version of the text. Our second baseline is a factored translation model (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) (called Factored) , which used as factors the word, “stem” 1 and suffix. These are derived from the same unsupervised segmentation model used in other experiments. The results (Table 3) show that a factored model was unable to match the scores of a simple wordbased baseline. We hypothesize that this may be an inherently difficult representational form for a language with the degree of morphological complexity found in Finnish. Because the morphology generation must be precomputed, for languages with a high degree of morphological complexity, the combinatorial explosion makes it unmanageable to capture the full range of morphological productivity. In addition, because the morphological variants are generated on a per-word basis within a given phrase, it excludes productive morphological combination across phrase boundaries and makes it impossible for the model to take into account any longdistance dependencies between morphemes. We conclude from this result that it may be more useful for an agglutinative language to use morphology beyond the confines of the phrasal unit, and condition its generation on more than just the local target stem. In order to compare the 1see Section 2.2. 33 performance of unsupervised segmentation for translation, our third baseline is a segmented translation model based on a supervised segmentation model (called Sup) , using the hand-built Omorfi morphological analyzer (Pirinen and Listenmaa, 2007) , which provided slightly higher BLEU scores than the word-based baseline. 2.2 Segmented Translation For segmented translation models, it cannot be taken for granted that greater linguistic accuracy in segmentation yields improved translation (Chang et al. , 2008) . Rather, the goal in segmentation for translation is instead to maximize the amount of lexical content-carrying morphology, while generalizing over the information not helpful for improving the translation model. We therefore trained several different segmentation models, considering factors of granularity, coverage, and source-target symmetry. We performed unsupervised segmentation of the target data, using Morfessor (Creutz and Lagus, 2005) and Paramor (Monson, 2008) , two top systems from the Morpho Challenge 2008 (their combined output was the Morpho Challenge winner) . However, translation models based upon either Paramor alone or the combined systems output could not match the wordbased baseline, so we concentrated on Morfessor. Morfessor uses minimum description length criteria to train a HMM-based segmentation model. When tested against a human-annotated gold standard of linguistic morpheme segmentations for Finnish, this algorithm outperforms competing unsupervised methods, achieving an F-score of 67.0% on a 3 million sentence corpus (Creutz and Lagus, 2006) . Varying the perplexity threshold in Morfessor does not segment more word types, but rather over-segments the same word types. In order to get robust, common segmentations, we trained the segmenter on the 5000 most frequent words2 ; we then used this to segment the entire data set. In order to improve coverage, we then further segmented 2For the factored model baseline we also used the same setting perplexity = 30, 5,000 most frequent words, but with all but the last suffix collapsed and called the “stem” . TabHMleoat1nr:gplhiMngor phermphocTur631ae04in, 81c9ie03ns67gi,64n0S14e567theTp 2rsa51t, 29Se 3t168able and in translation. any word type that contained a match from the most frequent suffix set, looking for the longest matching suffix character string. We call this method Unsup L-match. After the segmentation, word-internal morpheme boundary markers were inserted into the segmented text to be used to reconstruct the surface forms in the MT output. We then trained the Moses phrase-based system (Koehn et al., 2007) on the segmented and marked text. After decoding, it was a simple matter to join together all adjacent morphemes with word-internal boundary markers to reconstruct the surface forms. Figure 1(a) gives the full model overview for all the variants of the segmented translation model (supervised/unsupervised; with and without the Unsup L-match procedure) . Table 1shows how morphemes are being used in the MT system. Of the phrases that included segmentations (‘Morph’ in Table 1) , roughly a third were ‘productive’, i.e. had a hanging morpheme (with a form such as stem+) that could be joined to a suffix (‘Hanging Morph’ in Table 1) . However, in phrases used while decoding the development and test data, roughly a quarter of the phrases that generated the translated output included segmentations, but of these, only a small fraction (6%) had a hanging morpheme; and while there are many possible reasons to account for this we were unable to find a single convincing cause. 2.3 Morphology Generation Morphology generation as a post-processing step allows major vocabulary reduction in the translation model, and allows the use of morphologically targeted features for modeling inflection. A possible disadvantage of this approach is that in this model there is no opportunity to con34 sider the morphology in translation since it is removed prior to training the translation model. Morphology generation models can use a variety of bilingual and contextual information to capture dependencies between morphemes, often more long-distance than what is possible using n-gram language models over morphemes in the segmented model. Similar to previous work (Minkov et al. , 2007; Toutanova et al. , 2008) , we model morphology generation as a sequence learning problem. Un- like previous work, we use unsupervised morphology induction and use automatically generated suffix classes as tags. The first phase of our morphology prediction model is to train a MT system that produces morphologically simplified word forms in the target language. The output word forms are complex stems (a stem and some suffixes) but still missing some important suffix morphemes. In the second phase, the output of the MT decoder is then tagged with a sequence of abstract suffix tags. In particular, the output of the MT decoder is a sequence of complex stems denoted by x and the output is a sequence of suffix class tags denoted by y. We use a list of parts from (x,y) and map to a d-dimensional feature vector Φ(x, y) , with each dimension being a real number. We infer the best sequence of tags using: F(x) = argymaxp(y | x,w) where F(x) returns the highest scoring output y∗ . A conditional random field (CRF) (Lafferty et al. , 2001) defines the conditional probability as a linear score for each candidate y and a global normalization term: logp(y | x, w) = Φ(x, y) · w − log Z where Z = Py0∈ exp(Φ(x, y0) · w) . We use stochastiPc gradient descent (using crfsgd3) to train the weight vector w. So far, this is all off-the-shelf sequence learning. However, the output y∗ from the CRF decoder is still only a sequence of abstract suffix tags. The third and final phase in our morphology prediction model GEN(x) 3 http://leon. bottou. org/projects/sgd English Training Data words Finnish Training Data words Morphological Pre-Processing stem+ +morph MT System Alignment: word word word stem+ +morph stem stem+ +morph Post-Process: Morph Re-Stitching Fully inflected surface form Evaluation against original reference (a) Segmented Translation Model English Training Data words Finnish Training Data Morphological Pre-Prowceosrdsisng 1 stem+ +morph1+ +morph2 Morphological Pre-Processing 2 stem+ +morph1+ MPosrpthe-mPRr+eo-+cSmetsio crhp1i:nhg+swteomrd+ MA+lTmigwnSomyrspdthen 1mt:+ wsotermd complex stem: stem+morph1+ MPo rpsht-oPlro gcyesGse2n:erCaRtioFnstem+morph1+ morph2sLuarnfagcueagfeorMmomdealp ing Fully inflected surface form Evaluation against original reference (b) Post-Processing Model Translation & Generation Figure 1: Training and testing pipelines for the SMT models. is to take the abstract suffix tag sequence y∗ and then map it into fully inflected word forms, and rank those outputs using a morphemic language model. The abstract suffix tags are extracted from the unsupervised morpheme learning process, and are carefully designed to enable CRF training and decoding. We call this model CRFLM for short. Figure 1(b) shows the full pipeline and Figure 2 shows a worked example of all the steps involved. We use the morphologically segmented training data (obtained using the segmented corpus described in Section 2.24) and remove selected suffixes to create a morphologically simplified version of the training data. The MT model is trained on the morphologically simplified training data. The output from the MT system is then used as input to the CRF model. The CRF model was trained on a ∼210,000 Finnish sentences, consisting noefd d∼ o1n.5 a am ∼il2li1o0n,0 tokens; tishhe 2,000 cseens,te cnoncse Europarl t.e5s tm isl eito nco tnoskiesntesd; hoef 41,434 stem tokens. The labels in the output sequence y were obtained by selecting the most productive 150 stems, and then collapsing certain vowels into equivalence classes corresponding to Finnish vowel harmony patterns. Thus 4Note that unlike Section 2.2 we do not use Unsup L-match because when evaluating the CRF model on the suffix prediction task it obtained 95.61% without using Unsup L-match and 82.99% when using Unsup L-match. 35 variants -k¨ o and -ko become vowel-generic enclitic particle -kO, and variants -ss ¨a and -ssa become the vowel-generic inessive case marker -ssA, etc. This is the only language-specific component of our translation model. However, we expect this approach to work for other agglutinative languages as well. For fusional languages like Spanish, another mapping from suffix to abstract tags might be needed. These suffix transformations to their equivalence classes prevent morphophonemic variants of the same morpheme from competing against each other in the prediction model. This resulted in 44 possible label outputs per stem which was a reasonable sized tag-set for CRF training. The CRF was trained on monolingual features of the segmented text for suffix prediction, where t is the current token: Word Stem st−n, .., st, .., st+n(n = 4) Morph Prediction yt−2 , yt−1 , yt With this simple feature set, we were able to use features over longer distances, resulting in a total of 1,110,075 model features. After CRF based recovery of the suffix tag sequence, we use a bigram language model trained on a full segmented version on the training data to recover the original vowels. We used bigrams only, because the suffix vowel harmony alternation depends only upon the preceding phonemes in the word from which it was segmented. original training koskevaa mietint o¨ ¨a data: k ¨asitell ¨a ¨an segmentation: koske+ +va+ +a mietint ¨o+ + a¨ k a¨si+ +te+ +ll a¨+ + a¨+ +n (train bigram language model with mapping A = { a , a }) map n fi bniaglr asmuff liaxn gtou agbest mraocdte tag-set: koske+ +va+ +A mietint ¨o+ +A k ¨asi+ +te+ +ll ¨a+ + ¨a+ +n (train CRF model to predict the final suffix) peeling of final suffix: koske+ +va+ mietint ¨o+ k a¨si+ +te+ +ll a¨+ + a¨+ (train SMT model on this transformation of training data) (a) Training decoder output: koske+ +va+ mietint o¨+ k a¨si+ +te+ +ll a¨+ + a¨+ decoder output stitched up: koskeva+ mietint o¨+ k ¨asitell ¨a ¨a+ CRF model prediction: x = ‘koskeva+ mietint ¨o+ k ¨asitell ¨a ¨a+’, y = ‘+A +A +n’ koskeva+ +A mietint ¨o+ +A k ¨asitell a¨ ¨a+ +n unstitch morphemes: koske+ +va+ +A mietint ¨o+ +A k ¨asi+ +te+ +ll ¨a+ + ¨a+ +n language model disambiguation: koske+ +va+ +a mietint ¨o+ + a¨ k a¨si+ +te+ +ll a¨+ + a¨+ +n final stitching: koskevaa mietint o¨ ¨a k ¨asitell ¨a ¨an (the output is then compared to the reference translation) (b) Decoding Figure 2: Worked example of all steps in the post-processing morphology prediction model. 3 Experimental Results used the Europarl version 3 corpus (Koehn, 2005) English-Finnish training data set, as well as the standard development and test data sets.

In all the experiments conducted in this paper, we used the Moses5 phrase-based translation system (Koehn et al. , 2007) , 2008 version. We trained all of the Moses systems herein using the standard features: language model, reordering model, translation model, and word penalty; in addition to these, the factored experiments called for additional translation and generation features for the added factors as noted above. We used in all experiments the following settings: a hypothesis stack size 100, distortion limit 6, phrase translations limit 20, and maximum phrase length 20. For the language models, we used SRILM 5-gram language models (Stolcke, 2002) for all factors. For our word-based Baseline system, we trained a word-based model using the same Moses system with identical settings. For evaluation against segmented translation systems in segmented forms before word reconstruction, we also segmented the baseline system’s word-based output. All the BLEU scores reported are for lowercase evaluation. We did an initial evaluation of the segmented output translation for each system using the no5http://www.statmt.org/moses/ 36 TabSlBUeuna2gps:meulSipengLmta-e nioatedchMo12dme804-.lB8S714cL±oEr0eUs.6 9 S8up19Nre.358ofe498rUs9ntoihe supervised segmentation baseline model. m-BLEU indicates that the segmented output was evaluated against a segmented version of the reference (this measure does not have the same correlation with human judgement as BLEU) .

Table 2 shows the m-BLEU scores for various systems. We also show the m-BLEU score without unigrams, since over-segmentation could lead to artificially high m-BLEU scores. In fact, if we compare the relative improvement of our m-BLEU scores for the Unsup L-match system we see a relative improvement of 39.75% over the baseline. Luong et. al. (2010) report an m-BLEU score of 55.64% but obtain a relative improvement of 0.6% over their baseline m-BLEU score. We find that when using a good segmentation model, segmentation of the morphologically complex target language improves model performance over an unsegmented baseline (the confidence scores come from bootstrap resampling) .

We also show a better relative improvement over our baseline when compared to (Luong et al., 2010) : a relative improvement of 4.86% for Unsup L-match compared to our baseline word-based model, compared to their 1.65% improvement over their baseline word-based model. Our best performing method used unsupervised morphology with L-match (see Section 2.2) and the improvement is significant: bootstrap resampling provides a confidence margin of ±0.77 and a t-test (Collins ceot nafli.d , 2005) sahrogwined o significance aw ti-thte p = 0o.0ll0in1s. 3.1 Morphological Fluency Analysis To see how well the models were doing at getting morphology right, we examined several patterns of morphological behavior. While we wish to explore minimally supervised morphological MT models, and use as little language specific information as possible, we do want to use linguistic analysis on the output of our system to see how well the models capture essential morphological information in the target language. So, we ran the word-based baseline system, the segmented model (Unsup L-match) , and the prediction model (CRF-LM) outputs, along with the reference translation through the supervised morphological analyzer Omorfi (Pirinen and Listenmaa, 2007) . Using this analysis, we looked at a variety of linguistic constructions that might reveal patterns in morphological behavior. These were: (a) explicitly marked 37 noun forms, (b) noun-adjective case agreement, (c) subject-verb person/number agreement, (d) transitive object case marking, (e) postpositions, and (f) possession. In each of these categories, we looked for construction matches on a per-sentence level between the models’ output and the reference translation. Table 4 shows the models’ performance on the constructions we examined. In all of the categories, the CRF-LM model achieves the best precision score, as we explain below, while the Unsup L-match model most frequently gets the highest recall score. A general pattern in the most prevalent of these constructions is that the baseline tends to prefer the least marked form for noun cases (corresponding to the nominative) more than the reference or the CRF-LM model. The baseline leaves nouns in the (unmarked) nominative far more than the reference, while the CRF-LM model comes much closer, so it seems to fare better at explicitly marking forms, rather than defaulting to the more frequent unmarked form. Finnish adjectives must be marked with the same case as their head noun, while verbs must agree in person and number with their subject. We saw that in both these categories, the CRFLM model outperforms for precision, while the segmented model gets the best recall. In addition, Finnish generally marks direct objects of verbs with the accusative or the partitive case; we observed more accusative/partitive-marked nouns following verbs in the CRF-LM output than in the baseline, as illustrated by example (1) in Fig. 3. While neither translation picks the same verb as in the reference for the input ‘clarify,’ the CRFLM-output paraphrases it by using a grammatical construction of the transitive verb followed by a noun phrase inflected with the accusative case, correctly capturing the transitive construction. The baseline translation instead follows ‘give’ with a direct object in the nominative case. To help clarify the constructions in question, we have used Google Translate6 to provide back6 http://translate.google. com/ of occurrences per sentence, recall and F-score. also averaged The constructions over the various translations. are listed in descending P, R and F stand for precision, order of their frequency in the texts. The highlighted value in each column is the most accurate with respect to the reference value. translations of our MT output into English; to contextualize these back-translations, we have provided Google’s back-translation of the reference. The use of postpositions shows another difference between the models. Finnish postpositions require the preceding noun to be in the genitive or sometimes partitive case, which occurs correctly more frequently in the CRF-LM than the baseline. In example (2) in Fig. 3, all three translations correspond to the English text, ‘with the basque nationalists. ’ However, the CRF-LM output is more grammatical than the baseline, because not only do the adjective and noun agree for case, but the noun ‘baskien’ to which the postposition ‘kanssa’ belongs is marked with the correct genitive case. However, this well-formedness is not rewarded by BLEU, because ‘baskien’ does not match the reference. In addition, while Finnish may express possession using case marking alone, it has another construction for possession; this can disambiguate an otherwise ambiguous clause. This alternate construction uses a pronoun in the genitive case followed by a possessive-marked noun; we see that the CRF-LM model correctly marks this construction more frequently than the baseline. As example (3) in Fig. 3 shows, while neither model correctly translates ‘matkan’ (‘trip’) , the baseline’s output attributes the inessive ‘yhteydess’ (‘connection’) as belonging to ‘tulokset’ (‘results’) , and misses marking the possession linking it to ‘Commissioner Fischler’. Our manual evaluation shows that the CRF38 LM model is producing output translations that are more morphologically fluent than the wordbased baseline and the segmented translation Unsup L-match system, even though the word choices lead to a lower BLEU score overall when compared to Unsup L-match. 4 Related Work The work on morphology in MT can be grouped into three categories, factored models, segmented translation, and morphology generation. Factored models (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) factor the phrase translation probabilities over additional information annotated to each word, allowing for text to be represented on multiple levels of analysis. We discussed the drawbacks of factored models for our task in Section 2. 1. While (Koehn and Hoang, 2007; Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006; Avramidis and Koehn, 2008) obtain improvements using factored models for translation into English, German, Spanish, and Czech, these models may be less useful for capturing long-distance dependencies in languages with much more complex morphological systems such as Finnish. In our experiments factored models did worse than the baseline. Segmented translation performs morphological analysis on the morphologically complex text for use in the translation model (Brown et al. , 1993; Goldwater and McClosky, 2005; de Gispert and Mari n˜o, 2008) . This method unpacks complex forms into simpler, more frequently occurring components, and may also increase the symmetry of the lexically realized content be(1) Input: ‘the charter we are to approve today both strengthens and gives visible shape to the common fundamental rights and values our community is to be based upon. ’ a.

In a somewhat orthogonal approach to ours, (Ma et al. , 2007) use alignment of a parallel text to pack together adjacent segments in the alignment output, which are then fed back to the word aligner to bootstrap an improved alignment, which is then used in the translation model. We compared our results against (Luong et al. , 2010) in Table 3 since their results are directly comparable to ours. They use a segmented phrase table and language model along with the word-based versions in the decoder and in tuning a Finnish target. Their approach requires segmented phrases 39 to match word boundaries, eliminating morphologically productive phrases. In their work a segmented language model can score a translation, but cannot insert morphology that does not show source-side reflexes. In order to perform a similar experiment that still allowed for morphologically productive phrases, we tried training a segmented translation model, the output of which we stitched up in tuning so as to tune to a word-based reference. The goal of this experiment was to control the segmented model’s tendency to overfit by rewarding it for using correct whole-word forms. However, we found that this approach was less successful than using the segmented reference in tuning, and could not meet the baseline (13.97% BLEU best tuning score, versus 14.93% BLEU for the baseline best tuning score) . Previous work in segmented translation has often used linguistically motivated morphological analysis selectively applied based on a language-specific heuristic. A typical approach is to select a highly inflecting class of words and segment them for particular morphology (de Gispert and Mari n˜o, 2008; Ramanathan et al. , 2009) . Popovi¸ c and Ney (2004) perform segmentation to reduce morphological complexity of the source to translate into an isolating target, reducing the translation error rate for the English target. For Czech-to-English, Goldwater and McClosky (2005) lemmatized the source text and inserted a set of ‘pseudowords’ expected to have lexical reflexes in English. Minkov et. al. (2007) and Toutanova et. al. (2008) use a Maximum Entropy Markov Model for morphology generation. The main drawback to this approach is that it removes morphological information from the translation model (which only uses stems) ; this can be a problem for languages in which morphology ex- presses lexical content. de Gispert (2008) uses a language-specific targeted morphological classifier for Spanish verbs to avoid this issue. Talbot and Osborne (2006) use clustering to group morphological variants of words for word alignments and for smoothing phrase translation tables. Habash (2007) provides various methods to incorporate morphological variants of words in the phrase table in order to help recognize out of vocabulary words in the source language. 5 Conclusion and Future Work We found that using a segmented translation model based on unsupervised morphology induction and a model that combined morpheme segments in the translation model with a postprocessing morphology prediction model gave us better BLEU scores than a word-based baseline. Using our proposed approach we obtain better scores than the state of the art on the EnglishFinnish translation task (Luong et al. , 2010) : from 14.82% BLEU to 15.09%, while using a 40 simpler model. We show that using morphological segmentation in the translation model can improve output translation scores. We also demonstrate that for Finnish (and possibly other agglutinative languages) , phrase-based MT benefits from allowing the translation model access to morphological segmentation yielding productive morphological phrases. Taking advantage of linguistic analysis of the output we show that using a post-processing morphology generation model can improve translation fluency on a sub-word level, in a manner that is not captured by the BLEU word-based evaluation measure. In order to help with replication of the results in this paper, we have run the various morphological analysis steps and created the necessary training, tuning and test data files needed in order to train, tune and test any phrase-based machine translation system with our data. The files can be downloaded from natlang. cs.sfu. ca. In future work we hope to explore the utility of phrases with productive morpheme boundaries and explore why they are not used more pervasively in the decoder. Evaluation measures for morphologically complex languages and tun- ing to those measures are also important future work directions. Also, we would like to explore a non-pipelined approach to morphological preand post-processing so that a globally trained model could be used to remove the target side morphemes that would improve the translation model and then predict those morphemes in the target language.

<p>Author: Chi-kiu Lo ; Dekai Wu</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel semi-automated metric, MEANT, that assesses translation utility by matching semantic role fillers, producing scores that correlate with human judgment as well as HTER but at much lower labor cost. As machine translation systems improve in lexical choice and fluency, the shortcomings of widespread n-gram based, fluency-oriented MT evaluation metrics such as BLEU, which fail to properly evaluate adequacy, become more apparent. But more accurate, nonautomatic adequacy-oriented MT evaluation metrics like HTER are highly labor-intensive, which bottlenecks the evaluation cycle. We first show that when using untrained monolingual readers to annotate semantic roles in MT output, the non-automatic version of the metric HMEANT achieves a 0.43 correlation coefficient with human adequacyjudgments at the sentence level, far superior to BLEU at only 0.20, and equal to the far more expensive HTER. We then replace the human semantic role annotators with automatic shallow semantic parsing to further automate the evaluation metric, and show that even the semiautomated evaluation metric achieves a 0.34 correlation coefficient with human adequacy judgment, which is still about 80% as closely correlated as HTER despite an even lower labor cost for the evaluation procedure. The results show that our proposed metric is significantly better correlated with human judgment on adequacy than current widespread automatic evaluation metrics, while being much more cost effective than HTER. 1</p><p>5 0.82113129 <a title="216-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-The_impact_of_language_models_and_loss_functions_on_repair_disfluency_detection.html">301 acl-2011-The impact of language models and loss functions on repair disfluency detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Simon Zwarts ; Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: Unrehearsed spoken language often contains disfluencies. In order to correctly interpret a spoken utterance, any such disfluencies must be identified and removed or otherwise dealt with. Operating on transcripts of speech which contain disfluencies, we study the effect of language model and loss function on the performance of a linear reranker that rescores the 25-best output of a noisychannel model. We show that language models trained on large amounts of non-speech data improve performance more than a language model trained on a more modest amount of speech data, and that optimising f-score rather than log loss improves disfluency detection performance. Our approach uses a log-linear reranker, operating on the top n analyses of a noisy channel model. We use large language models, introduce new features into this reranker and . examine different optimisation strategies. We obtain a disfluency detection f-scores of 0.838 which improves upon the current state-of-theart.</p><p>6 0.74087179 <a title="216-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Towards_a_Framework_for_Abstractive_Summarization_of_Multimodal_Documents.html">308 acl-2011-Towards a Framework for Abstractive Summarization of Multimodal Documents</a></p>

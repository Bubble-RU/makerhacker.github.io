<p>Author: Lev Ratinov ; Dan Roth ; Doug Downey ; Mike Anderson</p><p>Abstract: Disambiguating concepts and entities in a context sensitive way is a fundamental problem in natural language processing. The comprehensiveness of Wikipedia has made the online encyclopedia an increasingly popular target for disambiguation. Disambiguation to Wikipedia is similar to a traditional Word Sense Disambiguation task, but distinct in that the Wikipedia link structure provides additional information about which disambiguations are compatible. In this work we analyze approaches that utilize this information to arrive at coherent sets of disambiguations for a given document (which we call “global” approaches), and compare them to more traditional (local) approaches. We show that previous approaches for global disambiguation can be improved, but even then the local disambiguation provides a baseline which is very hard to beat.</p><p>3 0.14908154 <a title="338-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Question_Detection_in_Spoken_Conversations_Using_Textual_Conversations.html">257 acl-2011-Question Detection in Spoken Conversations Using Textual Conversations</a></p>

<p>Author: Xin Zhao ; Jing Jiang ; Jing He ; Yang Song ; Palakorn Achanauparp ; Ee-Peng Lim ; Xiaoming Li</p><p>Abstract: Summarizing and analyzing Twitter content is an important and challenging task. In this paper, we propose to extract topical keyphrases as one way to summarize Twitter. We propose a context-sensitive topical PageRank method for keyword ranking and a probabilistic scoring function that considers both relevance and interestingness of keyphrases for keyphrase ranking. We evaluate our proposed methods on a large Twitter data set. Experiments show that these methods are very effective for topical keyphrase extraction.</p><p>5 0.049967423 <a title="338-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-An_Interface_for_Rapid_Natural_Language_Processing_Development_in_UIMA.html">42 acl-2011-An Interface for Rapid Natural Language Processing Development in UIMA</a></p>
<p>Author: Balaji Soundrarajan ; Thomas Ginter ; Scott DuVall</p><p>Abstract: This demonstration presents the Annotation Librarian, an application programming interface that supports rapid development of natural language processing (NLP) projects built in Apache Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA). The flexibility of UIMA to support all types of unstructured data – images, audio, and text – increases the complexity of some of the most common NLP development tasks. The Annotation Librarian interface handles these common functions and allows the creation and management of annotations by mirroring Java methods used to manipulate Strings. The familiar syntax and NLP-centric design allows developers to adopt and rapidly develop NLP algorithms in UIMA. The general functionality of the interface is described in relation to the use cases that necessitated its creation. 1</p><p>6 0.047027387 <a title="338-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Towards_Tracking_Semantic_Change_by_Visual_Analytics.html">307 acl-2011-Towards Tracking Semantic Change by Visual Analytics</a></p>

<p>Author: Oliver Ferschke ; Torsten Zesch ; Iryna Gurevych</p><p>Abstract: We present an open-source toolkit which allows (i) to reconstruct past states of Wikipedia, and (ii) to efficiently access the edit history of Wikipedia articles. Reconstructing past states of Wikipedia is a prerequisite for reproducing previous experimental work based on Wikipedia. Beyond that, the edit history of Wikipedia articles has been shown to be a valuable knowledge source for NLP, but access is severely impeded by the lack of efficient tools for managing the huge amount of provided data. By using a dedicated storage format, our toolkit massively decreases the data volume to less than 2% of the original size, and at the same time provides an easy-to-use interface to access the revision data. The language-independent design allows to process any language represented in Wikipedia. We expect this work to consolidate NLP research using Wikipedia in general, and to foster research making use of the knowledge encoded in Wikipedia’s edit history.</p><p>4 0.49995482 <a title="338-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Language_of_Vandalism%3A_Improving_Wikipedia_Vandalism_Detection_via_Stylometric_Analysis.html">195 acl-2011-Language of Vandalism: Improving Wikipedia Vandalism Detection via Stylometric Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Manoj Harpalani ; Michael Hart ; Sandesh Signh ; Rob Johnson ; Yejin Choi</p><p>Abstract: Community-based knowledge forums, such as Wikipedia, are susceptible to vandalism, i.e., ill-intentioned contributions that are detrimental to the quality of collective intelligence. Most previous work to date relies on shallow lexico-syntactic patterns and metadata to automatically detect vandalism in Wikipedia. In this paper, we explore more linguistically motivated approaches to vandalism detection. In particular, we hypothesize that textual vandalism constitutes a unique genre where a group of people share a similar linguistic behavior. Experimental results suggest that (1) statistical models give evidence to unique language styles in vandalism, and that (2) deep syntactic patterns based on probabilistic context free grammars (PCFG) discriminate vandalism more effectively than shallow lexicosyntactic patterns based on n-grams. ,</p><p>5 0.44515032 <a title="338-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Question_Detection_in_Spoken_Conversations_Using_Textual_Conversations.html">257 acl-2011-Question Detection in Spoken Conversations Using Textual Conversations</a></p>

<p>Author: Takashi Onishi ; Masao Utiyama ; Eiichiro Sumita</p><p>Abstract: One problem with phrase-based statistical machine translation is the problem of longdistance reordering when translating between languages with different word orders, such as Japanese-English. In this paper, we propose a method of imposing reordering constraints using document-level context. As the documentlevel context, we use noun phrases which significantly occur in context documents containing source sentences. Given a source sentence, zones which cover the noun phrases are used as reordering constraints. Then, in decoding, reorderings which violate the zones are restricted. Experiment results for patent translation tasks show a significant improvement of 1.20% BLEU points in JapaneseEnglish translation and 1.41% BLEU points in English-Japanese translation.</p><p>3 0.47576177 <a title="338-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-A_Word-Class_Approach_to_Labeling_PSCFG_Rules_for_Machine_Translation.html">29 acl-2011-A Word-Class Approach to Labeling PSCFG Rules for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Andreas Zollmann ; Stephan Vogel</p><p>Abstract: In this work we propose methods to label probabilistic synchronous context-free grammar (PSCFG) rules using only word tags, generated by either part-of-speech analysis or unsupervised word class induction. The proposals range from simple tag-combination schemes to a phrase clustering model that can incorporate an arbitrary number of features. Our models improve translation quality over the single generic label approach of Chiang (2005) and perform on par with the syntactically motivated approach from Zollmann and Venugopal (2006) on the NIST large Chineseto-English translation task. These results persist when using automatically learned word tags, suggesting broad applicability of our technique across diverse language pairs for which syntactic resources are not available.</p><p>4 0.43305457 <a title="338-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Towards_Tracking_Semantic_Change_by_Visual_Analytics.html">307 acl-2011-Towards Tracking Semantic Change by Visual Analytics</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian Rohrdantz ; Annette Hautli ; Thomas Mayer ; Miriam Butt ; Daniel A.

Previous studies have shown that computational models are capable of clustering and disambiguating senses, a more recent trend investigates whether changes in word meaning can be tracked by automatic methods. The aim of our study is to offer a new instrument for investigating the diachronic development of word senses in a way that allows for a better understanding of the nature of semantic change in general. For this purpose we combine techniques from the field of Visual Analytics with unsupervised methods from Natural Language Processing, allowing for an interactive visual exploration of semantic change.</p><p>5 0.43275559 <a title="338-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Social_Network_Extraction_from_Texts%3A_A_Thesis_Proposal.html">286 acl-2011-Social Network Extraction from Texts: A Thesis Proposal</a></p>

By extracting linguistic constructs relevant to social interactions, I will be able to empirically analyze different kinds of linguistic constructs that people use to express social interactions. Lastly, I will attempt to make convolution kernels more scalable and interpretable.</p><p>6 0.43106005 <a title="338-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Prototyping_virtual_instructors_from_human-human_corpora.html">252 acl-2011-Prototyping virtual instructors from human-human corpora</a></p>

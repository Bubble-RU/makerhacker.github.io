<p>Author: Siwei Wang ; Gina-Anne Levow</p><p>Abstract: Verbal feedback is an important information source in establishing interactional rapport. However, predicting verbal feedback across languages is challenging due to languagespecific differences, inter-speaker variation, and the relative sparseness and optionality of verbal feedback. In this paper, we employ an approach combining classifier weighting and SMOTE algorithm oversampling to improve verbal feedback prediction in Arabic, English, and Spanish dyadic conversations. This approach improves the prediction of verbal feedback, up to 6-fold, while maintaining a high overall accuracy. Analyzing highly weighted features highlights widespread use of pitch, with more varied use of intensity and duration.</p><p>3 0.14806581 <a title="223-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Entrainment_in_Speech_Preceding_Backchannels..html">118 acl-2011-Entrainment in Speech Preceding Backchannels.</a></p>
<p>Author: Rivka Levitan ; Agustin Gravano ; Julia Hirschberg</p><p>Abstract: In conversation, when speech is followed by a backchannel, evidence of continued engagement by one’s dialogue partner, that speech displays a combination of cues that appear to signal to one’s interlocutor that a backchannel is appropriate. We term these cues backchannel-preceding cues (BPC)s, and examine the Columbia Games Corpus for evidence of entrainment on such cues. Entrainment, the phenomenon of dialogue partners becoming more similar to each other, is widely believed to be crucial to conversation quality and success. Our results show that speaking partners entrain on BPCs; that is, they tend to use similar sets of BPCs; this similarity increases over the course of a dialogue; and this similarity is associated with measures of dialogue coordination and task success. 1</p><p>4 0.10402773 <a title="223-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Detection_of_Agreement_and_Disagreement_in_Broadcast_Conversations.html">95 acl-2011-Detection of Agreement and Disagreement in Broadcast Conversations</a></p>
<p>Author: Wen Wang ; Sibel Yaman ; Kristin Precoda ; Colleen Richey ; Geoffrey Raymond</p><p>Abstract: We present Conditional Random Fields based approaches for detecting agreement/disagreement between speakers in English broadcast conversation shows. We develop annotation approaches for a variety of linguistic phenomena. Various lexical, structural, durational, and prosodic features are explored. We compare the performance when using features extracted from automatically generated annotations against that when using human annotations. We investigate the efficacy of adding prosodic features on top of lexical, structural, and durational features. Since the training data is highly imbalanced, we explore two sampling approaches, random downsampling and ensemble downsampling. Overall, our approach achieves 79.2% (precision), 50.5% (recall), 61.7% (F1) for agreement detection and 69.2% (precision), 46.9% (recall), and 55.9% (F1) for disagreement detection, on the English broadcast conversation data. 1 ?yIntroduction In ?ythis work, we present models for detecting agre?yement/disagreement (denoted (dis)agreement) betwy?een speakers in English broadcast conversation show?ys. The Broadcast Conversation (BC) genre differs from the Broadcast News (BN) genre in that it is?y more interactive and spontaneous, referring to freey? speech in news-style TV and radio programs and consisting of talk shows, interviews, call-in prog?yrams, live reports, and round-tables. Previous y? y?This work was performed while the author was at ICSI. syaman@us . ibm .com, graymond@ s oc .uc sb . edu work on detecting (dis)agreements has been focused on meeting data. (Hillard et al., 2003), (Galley et al., 2004), (Hahn et al., 2006) used spurt-level agreement annotations from the ICSI meeting corpus (Janin et al., 2003). (Hillard et al., 2003) explored unsupervised machine learning approaches and on manual transcripts, they achieved an overall 3-way agreement/disagreement classification ac- curacy as 82% with keyword features. (Galley et al., 2004) explored Bayesian Networks for the detection of (dis)agreements. They used adjacency pair information to determine the structure of their conditional Markov model and outperformed the results of (Hillard et al., 2003) by improving the 3way classification accuracy into 86.9%. (Hahn et al., 2006) explored semi-supervised learning algorithms and reached a competitive performance of 86.7% 3-way classification accuracy on manual transcriptions with only lexical features. (Germesin and Wilson, 2009) investigated supervised machine learning techniques and yields competitive results on the annotated data from the AMI meeting corpus (McCowan et al., 2005). Our work differs from these previous studies in two major categories. One is that a different definition of (dis)agreement was used. In the current work, a (dis)agreement occurs when a responding speaker agrees with, accepts, or disagrees with or rejects, a statement or proposition by a first speaker. Second, we explored (dis)agreement detection in broadcast conversation. Due to the difference in publicity and intimacy/collegiality between speakers in broadcast conversations vs. meet- ings, (dis)agreement may have different character374 Proceedings ofP thoer t4l9atnhd A, Onrnuegaoln M,e Jeuntineg 19 o-f2 t4h,e 2 A0s1s1o.c?i ac t2io0n11 fo Ar Cssoocmiaptuiotanti foonra Clo Lminpguutiast i ocns:aslh Loirntpgaupisetrics , pages 374–378, istics. Different from the unsupervised approaches in (Hillard et al., 2003) and semi-supervised approaches in (Hahn et al., 2006), we conducted supervised training. Also, different from (Hillard et al., 2003) and (Galley et al., 2004), our classification was carried out on the utterance level, instead of on the spurt-level. Galley et al. extended Hillard et al.’s work by adding features from previous spurts and features from the general dialog context to infer the class of the current spurt, on top of features from the current spurt (local features) used by Hillard et al. Galley et al. used adjacency pairs to describe the interaction between speakers and the relations between consecutive spurts. In this preliminary study on broadcast conversation, we directly modeled (dis)agreement detection without using adjacency pairs. Still, within the conditional random fields (CRF) framework, we explored features from preceding and following utterances to consider context in the discourse structure. We explored a wide variety of features, including lexical, structural, du- rational, and prosodic features. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate detection of agreement/disagreement for broadcast conversation data. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our data and automatic annotation modules. Section 3 describes various features and the CRF model we explored. Experimental results and discussion appear in Section 4, as well as conclusions and future directions. 2 Data and Automatic Annotation In this work, we selected English broadcast conversation data from the DARPA GALE program collected data (GALE Phase 1 Release 4, LDC2006E91; GALE Phase 4 Release 2, LDC2009E15). Human transcriptions and manual speaker turn labels are used in this study. Also, since the (dis)agreement detection output will be used to analyze social roles and relations of an interacting group, we first manually marked soundbites and then excluded soundbites during annotation and modeling. We recruited annotators to provide manual annotations of speaker roles and (dis)agreement to use for the supervised training of models. We de- fined a set of speaker roles as follows. Host/chair is a person associated with running the discussions 375 or calling the meeting. Reporting participant is a person reporting from the field, from a subcommittee, etc. Commentator participant/Topic participant is a person providing commentary on some subject, or person who is the subject of the conversation and plays a role, e.g., as a newsmaker. Audience participant is an ordinary person who may call in, ask questions at a microphone at e.g. a large presentation, or be interviewed because of their presence at a news event. Other is any speaker who does not fit in one of the above categories, such as a voice talent, an announcer doing show openings or commercial breaks, or a translator. Agreements and disagreements are composed of different combinations of initiating utterances and responses. We reformulated the (dis)agreement detection task as the sequence tagging of 11 (dis)agreement-related labels for identifying whether a given utterance is initiating a (dis)agreement opportunity, is a (dis)agreement response to such an opportunity, or is neither of these, in the show. For example, a Negative tag question followed by a negation response forms an agreement, that is, A: [Negative tag] This is not black and white, is it? B: [Agreeing Response] No, it isn’t. The data sparsity problem is serious. Among all 27,071 utterances, only 2,589 utterances are involved in (dis)agreement as initiating or response utterances, about 10% only among all data, while 24,482 utterances are not involved. These annotators also labeled shows with a variety of linguistic phenomena (denoted language use constituents, LUC), including discourse markers, disfluencies, person addresses and person mentions, prefaces, extreme case formulations, and dialog act tags (DAT). We categorized dialog acts into statement, question, backchannel, and incomplete. We classified disfluencies (DF) into filled pauses (e.g., uh, um), repetitions, corrections, and false starts. Person address (PA) terms are terms that a speaker uses to address another person. Person mentions (PM) are references to non-participants in the conversation. Discourse markers (DM) are words or phrases that are related to the structure of the discourse and express a relation between two utter- ances, for example, I mean, you know. Prefaces (PR) are sentence-initial lexical tokens serving functions close to discourse markers (e.g., Well, I think that...). Extreme case formulations (ECF) are lexical patterns emphasizing extremeness (e.g., This is the best book I have ever read). In the end, we manually annotated 49 English shows. We preprocessed English manual transcripts by removing transcriber annotation markers and noise, removing punctuation and case information, and conducting text normalization. We also built automatic rule-based and statistical annotation tools for these LUCs. 3 Features and Model We explored lexical, structural, durational, and prosodic features for (dis)agreement detection. We included a set of “lexical” features, including ngrams extracted from all of that speaker’s utterances, denoted ngram features. Other lexical features include the presence of negation and acquiescence, yes/no equivalents, positive and negative tag questions, and other features distinguishing different types of initiating utterances and responses. We also included various lexical features extracted from LUC annotations, denoted LUC features. These additional features include features related to the presence of prefaces, the counts of types and tokens of discourse markers, extreme case formulations, disfluencies, person addressing events, and person mentions, and the normalized values of these counts by sentence length. We also include a set of features related to the DAT of the current utterance and preceding and following utterances. We developed a set of “structural” and “durational” features, inspired by conversation analysis, to quantitatively represent the different participation and interaction patterns of speakers in a show. We extracted features related to pausing and overlaps between consecutive turns, the absolute and relative duration of consecutive turns, and so on. We used a set of prosodic features including pause, duration, and the speech rate of a speaker. We also used pitch and energy of the voice. Prosodic features were computed on words and phonetic alignment of manual transcripts. Features are computed for the beginning and ending words of an utterance. For the duration features, we used the average and maximum vowel duration from forced align- ment, both unnormalized and normalized for vowel identity and phone context. For pitch and energy, we 376 calculated the minimum, maximum,E range, mean, standard deviation, skewnesSs and kurEtosis values. A decision tree model was useSd to comEpute posteriors fFrom prosodic features and Swe used cuEmulative binnFing of posteriors as final feSatures , simEilar to (Liu et aFl., 2006).

During testing, the most likely sequence E is found using the Viterbi algorithm. One of the motivations of choosing conditional random fields was to avoid the label-bias problem found in hidden Markov models. Compared to Maximum Entropy modeling, the CRF model is optimized globally over the entire sequence, whereas the ME model makes a decision at each point individually without considering the context event information. 4 Experiments All (dis)agreement detection results are based on nfold cross-validation. In this procedure, we held out one show as the test set, randomly held out another show as the dev set, trained models on the rest of the data, and tested the model on the heldout show. We iterated through all shows and computed the overall accuracy. Table 1 shows the results of (dis)agreement detection using all features except prosodic features. We compared two conditions: (1) features extracted completely from the automatic LUC annotations and automatically detected speaker roles, and (2) features from manual speaker role labels and manual LUC annotations when man- ual annotations are available. Table 1 showed that running a fully automatic system to generate automatic annotations and automatic speaker roles produced comparable performance to the system using features from manual annotations whenever available. Table 1: Precision (%), recall (%), and F1 (%) of (dis)agreement detection using features extracted from manual speaker role labels and manual LUC annotations when available, denoted Manual Annotation, and automatic LUC annotations and automatically detected speaker roles, denoted Automatic Annotation.

The results are shown in Table 2. Adding prosodic features produced a 0.7% absolute gain on F1 on agreement detection, and 1.5% absolute gain on F1 on disagreement detection.

This indicates a highly imbalanced data set as one class is more heavily represented than the other/others. We suspected that this high imbalance has played a major role in the high precision and low recall results we obtained so far. Various approaches have been studied to handle imbalanced data for classifications, 377 trying to balaNnce the class distribution in the training set by eithNer oversaNmpling the minority class or downsamplinNg the maNjority class. In this preliminary study of NNsamplingN Napproaches for handling imbalanced dataN NNfor CRF Ntraining, we investigated two apprNoaches, rNNandom dNownsampling and ensemble dowNnsamplinNgN. RandoNm downsampling randomly dowNnsamples NNthe majorNity class to equate the number Nof minoritNNy and maNjority class samples. Ensemble NdownsampNNling is a N refinement of random downsamNpling whiNNch doesn’Nt discard any majority class samNples. InstNNead, we pNartitioned the majority class samNples into NN subspaNces with each subspace containiNng the samNe numbNer of samples as the minority clasNs. Then wNe train N CRF models, each based on thNe minoritNy class samples and one disjoint partitionN Nfrom the N subspaces. During testing, the posterioNr probability for one utterance is averaged over the N CRF models. The results from these two sampling approaches as well as the baseline are shown in Table 3. Both sampling approaches achieved significant improvement over the baseline, i.e., train- ing on the original data set, and ensemble downsampling produced better performance than downsampling. We noticed that both sampling approaches degraded slightly in precision but improved significantly in recall, resulting in 4.5% absolute gain on F1 for agreement detection and 4.7% absolute gain on F1 for disagreement detection.

We explored a variety of features, including lexical, structural, durational, and prosodic features. We experimented these features using a linear-chain conditional random fields model and conducted supervised training. We observed significant improvement from adding prosodic features and employing two sampling approaches, random downsampling and ensemble downsampling. Overall, we achieved 79.2% (precision), 50.5% (recall), 61.7% (F1) for agreement detection and 69.2% (precision), 46.9% (recall), and 55.9% (F1) for disagreement detection, on English broadcast conversation data. In future work, we plan to continue adding and refining features, explore dependencies between features and contextual cues with respect to agreements and disagreements, and investigate the efficacy of other machine learning approaches such as Bayesian networks and Support Vector Machines.

<p>Author: Bing Xiang ; Abraham Ittycheriah</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel discriminative mixture model for statistical machine translation (SMT). We model the feature space with a log-linear combination ofmultiple mixture components. Each component contains a large set of features trained in a maximumentropy framework. All features within the same mixture component are tied and share the same mixture weights, where the mixture weights are trained discriminatively to maximize the translation performance. This approach aims at bridging the gap between the maximum-likelihood training and the discriminative training for SMT. It is shown that the feature space can be partitioned in a variety of ways, such as based on feature types, word alignments, or domains, for various applications. The proposed approach improves the translation performance significantly on a large-scale Arabic-to-English MT task.</p><p>6 0.082752973 <a title="223-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Prototyping_virtual_instructors_from_human-human_corpora.html">252 acl-2011-Prototyping virtual instructors from human-human corpora</a></p>

<p>Author: Derya Ozkan ; Louis-Philippe Morency</p><p>Abstract: In many computational linguistic scenarios, training labels are subjectives making it necessary to acquire the opinions of multiple annotators/experts, which is referred to as ”wisdom of crowds”. In this paper, we propose a new approach for modeling wisdom of crowds based on the Latent Mixture of Discriminative Experts (LMDE) model that can automatically learn the prototypical patterns and hidden dynamic among different experts. Experiments show improvement over state-of-the-art approaches on the task of listener backchannel prediction in dyadic conversations.</p><p>2 0.81401318 <a title="223-lsi-2" href="./acl-2011-Contrasting_Multi-Lingual_Prosodic_Cues_to_Predict_Verbal_Feedback_for_Rapport.html">83 acl-2011-Contrasting Multi-Lingual Prosodic Cues to Predict Verbal Feedback for Rapport</a></p>
<p>Author: Siwei Wang ; Gina-Anne Levow</p><p>Abstract: Verbal feedback is an important information source in establishing interactional rapport. However, predicting verbal feedback across languages is challenging due to languagespecific differences, inter-speaker variation, and the relative sparseness and optionality of verbal feedback. In this paper, we employ an approach combining classifier weighting and SMOTE algorithm oversampling to improve verbal feedback prediction in Arabic, English, and Spanish dyadic conversations. This approach improves the prediction of verbal feedback, up to 6-fold, while maintaining a high overall accuracy. Analyzing highly weighted features highlights widespread use of pitch, with more varied use of intensity and duration.</p><p>3 0.73238868 <a title="223-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-N-Best_Rescoring_Based_on_Pitch-accent_Patterns.html">228 acl-2011-N-Best Rescoring Based on Pitch-accent Patterns</a></p>
<p>Author: Je Hun Jeon ; Wen Wang ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we adopt an n-best rescoring scheme using pitch-accent patterns to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance. The pitch-accent model is decoupled from the main ASR system, thus allowing us to develop it independently. N-best hypotheses from recognizers are rescored by additional scores that measure the correlation of the pitch-accent patterns between the acoustic signal and lexical cues. To test the robustness of our algorithm, we use two different data sets and recognition setups: the first one is English radio news data that has pitch accent labels, but the recognizer is trained from a small amount ofdata and has high error rate; the second one is English broadcast news data using a state-of-the-art SRI recognizer. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach is able to reduce word error rate relatively by about 3%. This gain is consistent across the two different tests, showing promising future directions of incorporating prosodic information to improve speech recognition.</p><p>4 0.72691023 <a title="223-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Entrainment_in_Speech_Preceding_Backchannels..html">118 acl-2011-Entrainment in Speech Preceding Backchannels.</a></p>
<p>Author: Rivka Levitan ; Agustin Gravano ; Julia Hirschberg</p><p>Abstract: In conversation, when speech is followed by a backchannel, evidence of continued engagement by one’s dialogue partner, that speech displays a combination of cues that appear to signal to one’s interlocutor that a backchannel is appropriate. We term these cues backchannel-preceding cues (BPC)s, and examine the Columbia Games Corpus for evidence of entrainment on such cues. Entrainment, the phenomenon of dialogue partners becoming more similar to each other, is widely believed to be crucial to conversation quality and success. Our results show that speaking partners entrain on BPCs; that is, they tend to use similar sets of BPCs; this similarity increases over the course of a dialogue; and this similarity is associated with measures of dialogue coordination and task success. 1</p><p>5 0.7153846 <a title="223-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Turn-Taking_Cues_in_a_Human_Tutoring_Corpus.html">312 acl-2011-Turn-Taking Cues in a Human Tutoring Corpus</a></p>
<p>Author: Heather Friedberg</p><p>Abstract: Most spoken dialogue systems are still lacking in their ability to accurately model the complex process that is human turntaking. This research analyzes a humanhuman tutoring corpus in order to identify prosodic turn-taking cues, with the hopes that they can be used by intelligent tutoring systems to predict student turn boundaries. Results show that while there was variation between subjects, three features were significant turn-yielding cues overall. In addition, a positive relationship between the number of cues present and the probability of a turn yield was demonstrated. 1</p><p>6 0.69401681 <a title="223-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Detection_of_Agreement_and_Disagreement_in_Broadcast_Conversations.html">95 acl-2011-Detection of Agreement and Disagreement in Broadcast Conversations</a></p>

<p>Author: Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi ; Hal Daume III ; Raghavendra Udupa</p><p>Abstract: Mapping documents into an interlingual representation can help bridge the language barrier of a cross-lingual corpus. Previous approaches use aligned documents as training data to learn an interlingual representation, making them sensitive to the domain of the training data. In this paper, we learn an interlingual representation in an unsupervised manner using only a bilingual dictionary. We first use the bilingual dictionary to find candidate document alignments and then use them to find an interlingual representation. Since the candidate alignments are noisy, we de- velop a robust learning algorithm to learn the interlingual representation. We show that bilingual dictionaries generalize to different domains better: our approach gives better performance than either a word by word translation method or Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) trained on a different domain.</p><p>3 0.56457764 <a title="223-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Contrasting_Multi-Lingual_Prosodic_Cues_to_Predict_Verbal_Feedback_for_Rapport.html">83 acl-2011-Contrasting Multi-Lingual Prosodic Cues to Predict Verbal Feedback for Rapport</a></p>

<p>Author: Nina Dethlefs ; Heriberto Cuayahuitl</p><p>Abstract: Surface realisation decisions in language generation can be sensitive to a language model, but also to decisions of content selection. We therefore propose the joint optimisation of content selection and surface realisation using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). To this end, we suggest a novel reward function that is induced from human data and is especially suited for surface realisation. It is based on a generation space in the form of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Results in terms of task success and human-likeness suggest that our unified approach performs better than greedy or random baselines.</p><p>5 0.55865932 <a title="223-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Neutralizing_Linguistically_Problematic_Annotations_in_Unsupervised_Dependency_Parsing_Evaluation.html">230 acl-2011-Neutralizing Linguistically Problematic Annotations in Unsupervised Dependency Parsing Evaluation</a></p>
<p>Author: Roy Schwartz ; Omri Abend ; Roi Reichart ; Ari Rappoport</p><p>Abstract: Dependency parsing is a central NLP task. In this paper we show that the common evaluation for unsupervised dependency parsing is highly sensitive to problematic annotations. We show that for three leading unsupervised parsers (Klein and Manning, 2004; Cohen and Smith, 2009; Spitkovsky et al., 2010a), a small set of parameters can be found whose modification yields a significant improvement in standard evaluation measures. These parameters correspond to local cases where no linguistic consensus exists as to the proper gold annotation. Therefore, the standard evaluation does not provide a true indication of algorithm quality. We present a new measure, Neutral Edge Direction (NED), and show that it greatly reduces this undesired phenomenon.</p><p>6 0.55803585 <a title="223-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-An_Empirical_Investigation_of_Discounting_in_Cross-Domain_Language_Models.html">38 acl-2011-An Empirical Investigation of Discounting in Cross-Domain Language Models</a></p>

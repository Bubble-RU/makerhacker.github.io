<p>Author: Shuguang Li ; Suresh Manandhar</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of question recommendation from large archives of community question answering data by exploiting the users’ information needs. Our experimental results indicate that questions based on the same or similar information need can provide excellent question recommendation. We show that translation model can be effectively utilized to predict the information need given only the user’s query question.

<p>Author: Guangyou Zhou ; Li Cai ; Jun Zhao ; Kang Liu</p><p>Abstract: Community-based question answer (Q&A;) has become an important issue due to the popularity of Q&A; archives on the web. This paper is concerned with the problem of question retrieval. Question retrieval in Q&A; archives aims to find historical questions that are semantically equivalent or relevant to the queried questions. In this paper, we propose a novel phrase-based translation model for question retrieval. Compared to the traditional word-based translation models, the phrasebased translation model is more effective because it captures contextual information in modeling the translation ofphrases as a whole, rather than translating single words in isolation. Experiments conducted on real Q&A; data demonstrate that our proposed phrasebased translation model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art word-based translation model.</p><p>5 0.10683501 <a title="25-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Knowledge_Base_Population%3A_Successful_Approaches_and_Challenges.html">191 acl-2011-Knowledge Base Population: Successful Approaches and Challenges</a></p>
<p>Author: Heng Ji ; Ralph Grishman</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we give an overview of the Knowledge Base Population (KBP) track at the 2010 Text Analysis Conference. The main goal of KBP is to promote research in discovering facts about entities and augmenting a knowledge base (KB) with these facts. This is done through two tasks, Entity Linking linking names in context to entities in the KB and Slot Filling – adding information about an entity to the KB. A large source collection of newswire and web documents is provided from which systems are to discover information. Attributes (“slots”) derived from Wikipedia infoboxes are used to create the reference KB. In this paper we provide an overview of the techniques which can serve as a basis for a good KBP system, lay out the – – remaining challenges by comparison with traditional Information Extraction (IE) and Question Answering (QA) tasks, and provide some suggestions to address these challenges. 1</p><p>6 0.10168256 <a title="25-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Confidence_Driven_Unsupervised_Semantic_Parsing.html">79 acl-2011-Confidence Driven Unsupervised Semantic Parsing</a></p>

<p>Author: Percy Liang ; Michael Jordan ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Compositional question answering begins by mapping questions to logical forms, but training a semantic parser to perform this mapping typically requires the costly annotation of the target logical forms. In this paper, we learn to map questions to answers via latent logical forms, which are induced automatically from question-answer pairs. In tackling this challenging learning problem, we introduce a new semantic representation which highlights a parallel between dependency syntax and efficient evaluation of logical forms. On two standard semantic parsing benchmarks (GEO and JOBS), our system obtains the highest published accuracies, despite requiring no annotated logical forms.</p><p>6 0.44882768 <a title="25-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Query_Snowball%3A_A_Co-occurrence-based_Approach_to_Multi-document_Summarization_for_Question_Answering.html">255 acl-2011-Query Snowball: A Co-occurrence-based Approach to Multi-document Summarization for Question Answering</a></p>

<p>Author: Jacob Eisenstein ; Noah A. Smith ; Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to discover robust and interpretable sociolinguistic associations from raw geotagged text data. Using aggregate demographic statistics about the authors’ geographic communities, we solve a multi-output regression problem between demographics and lexical frequencies. By imposing a composite ‘1,∞ regularizer, we obtain structured sparsity, driving entire rows of coefficients to zero. We perform two regression studies. First, we use term frequencies to predict demographic attributes; our method identifies a compact set of words that are strongly associated with author demographics. Next, we conjoin demographic attributes into features, which we use to predict term frequencies. The composite regularizer identifies a small number of features, which correspond to communities of authors united by shared demographic and linguistic properties.</p><p>3 0.65395737 <a title="25-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Binarized_Forest_to_String_Translation.html">61 acl-2011-Binarized Forest to String Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Hao Zhang ; Licheng Fang ; Peng Xu ; Xiaoyun Wu</p><p>Abstract: Tree-to-string translation is syntax-aware and efficient but sensitive to parsing errors. Forestto-string translation approaches mitigate the risk of propagating parser errors into translation errors by considering a forest of alternative trees, as generated by a source language parser. We propose an alternative approach to generating forests that is based on combining sub-trees within the first best parse through binarization. Provably, our binarization forest can cover any non-consitituent phrases in a sentence but maintains the desirable property that for each span there is at most one nonterminal so that the grammar constant for decoding is relatively small. For the purpose of reducing search errors, we apply the synchronous binarization technique to forest-tostring decoding. Combining the two techniques, we show that using a fast shift-reduce parser we can achieve significant quality gains in NIST 2008 English-to-Chinese track (1.3 BLEU points over a phrase-based system, 0.8 BLEU points over a hierarchical phrase-based system). Consistent and significant gains are also shown in WMT 2010 in the English to German, French, Spanish and Czech tracks.</p><p>4 0.63981193 <a title="25-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Social_Network_Extraction_from_Texts%3A_A_Thesis_Proposal.html">286 acl-2011-Social Network Extraction from Texts: A Thesis Proposal</a></p>

To date Ihave defined a comprehensive set of social events and built a preliminary system that extracts social events from news articles. Iplan to improve the performance of my current system by incorporating semantic information. Using domain adaptation techniques, Ipropose to apply my system to a wide range of genres. By extracting linguistic constructs relevant to social interactions, I will be able to empirically analyze different kinds of linguistic constructs that people use to express social interactions. Lastly, I will attempt to make convolution kernels more scalable and interpretable.</p><p>5 0.63792592 <a title="25-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-IMASS%3A_An_Intelligent_Microblog_Analysis_and_Summarization_System.html">156 acl-2011-IMASS: An Intelligent Microblog Analysis and Summarization System</a></p>
<p>Author: Jui-Yu Weng ; Cheng-Lun Yang ; Bo-Nian Chen ; Yen-Kai Wang ; Shou-De Lin</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a system to summarize a Microblog post and its responses with the goal to provide readers a more constructive and concise set of information for efficient digestion. We introduce a novel two-phase summarization scheme. In the first phase, the post plus its responses are classified into four categories based on the intention, interrogation, sharing, discussion and chat. For each type of post, in the second phase, we exploit different strategies, including opinion analysis, response pair identification, and response relevancy detection, to summarize and highlight critical information to display.

</p><p>5 They can read text with several spelling errors and grammatical errors and still easily identify what the author originally meant to write. [sent-11, score-0.574]
</p><p>6 Also, current grammar correction systems are mostly rule-based, searching the text for de-  fined types of rule violations in the English grammar. [sent-15, score-0.404]
</p><p>7 In this paper, we approach this problem by modeling various types of human errors using a noisy channel model (Shannon, 1948). [sent-17, score-0.367]
</p><p>8 Correct sentences are produced by a predefined generative probabilistic model, and lesioned by the noise model. [sent-18, score-0.368]
</p><p>9 We learn the noise model parameters using an expectation-maximization (EM) approach (Dempster et al. [sent-19, score-0.419]
</p><p>10 Our model allows us to deduce the original intended sentence by looking for the the highest probability parses over the entire sentence, which leads to automated whole sentence spelling and grammar correction based on contextual information. [sent-21, score-0.85]
</p><p>11 In Section 5 we present a novel technique for evaluating the task of automated grammar and spelling correction, along with the data set we collected for our experiments. [sent-23, score-0.352]

</p><p>13 Eegolofsson and Knutsson (2003) used rule-based methods to approach the problem of discovering preposition and determiner errors of L2 writers, and various classifier-based methods using Maximum Entropy models have also been proposed (Izumi et al. [sent-32, score-0.298]
</p><p>14 The output scores of classifiers do not take into account the observed erroneous word, changing the task of editing into a fill-in-the-blank selection task. [sent-36, score-0.336]
</p><p>15 Generation-based approaches to grammar correction have also been taken, such as Lee and Seneff (2006), where sentences are paraphrased into an over-generated word lattice, and then parsed to select the best rephrasing. [sent-38, score-0.477]
</p><p>16 As with the previously mentioned approaches, these approaches often have the disadvantage of ignoring the writer’s selected word when used for error correction instead of just error detection. [sent-39, score-0.522]
</p><p>17 Other work which relates to automated grammar correction has been done in the field of machine translation. [sent-40, score-0.464]
</p><p>18 put of MT systems, note that the task of grammar correction itself can also be thought of as a machine translation task, where we are trying to ‘translate’ a sentence from an ‘incorrect grammar’ language to a ‘correct grammar’ language. [sent-45, score-0.503]
</p><p>19 Under this idea, the use of statistical machine translation techniques to correct grammatical errors has also been explored. [sent-46, score-0.332]
</p><p>20 D ´esilets and Hermet (2009) use a round-trip translation from L2 to L1 and back to L2 to correct errors using an SMT system, focusing on errors which link back to the writer’s native language. [sent-49, score-0.443]
</p><p>21 Despite the underlying commonality between the tasks of machine translation and grammar correction, there is a practical difference in that the field of grammar correction suffers from a lack of good quality parallel corpora. [sent-50, score-0.561]
</p><p>22 While machine translation  has taken advantage of the plethora of translated documents and books, from which various corpora have been built, the field of grammar correction does not have this luxury. [sent-51, score-0.479]
</p><p>23 Using classification or rule-based systems for grammatical error detection has proven to be successful to some extent, but many approaches are not sufficient for real-world automated grammar correction for various of reasons. [sent-53, score-0.67]
</p><p>24 For example, if a student erroneously writes ‘much poeple’ instead of ‘many people’ , a system trying to correct ‘many/much’ errors may skip correction of much to many because it While grammar correction can be used on the out-935does  not have any reference to  the misspelled word  ‘poeple’ . [sent-59, score-0.984]
</p><p>25 3  Base Model  Our noisy channel model consists of two main components, a base language model and a noise model. [sent-62, score-0.564]
</p><p>26 The probabilistic noise model then takes this sentence and decides whether or not to make it erroneous by inserting various types of errors, such as spelling mistakes,  article choice errors, wordform choice errors, etc. [sent-64, score-1.178]
</p><p>27 For the noise model, we need some way to learn the parameters for the mistakes that a group of specified writers (such as Korean ESL students) make. [sent-68, score-0.435]
</p><p>28 Using this model, we can find the highest likelihood error-free sentence for an observed output sentence by tracing all possible paths from the language model through the noise model and ending in the observed sentence as output. [sent-70, score-0.808]
</p><p>29 4  Implementation  To actually implement our model, we use a bigram  model for the base language model, and various noise models which introduce spelling errors, article choice errors, preposition choice errors, etc. [sent-71, score-1.085]
</p><p>30 1 Base language model The base language model is a bigram model implemented by using a weighted finite-state transducer  (wFST). [sent-77, score-0.358]
</p><p>31 To lower our memory usage, only bigrams whose words are found in the observed sentences, or are determined to be possible candidates for the correct words ofthe original sentence (due to the noise models) are used. [sent-79, score-0.476]
</p><p>32 The arcs of the wFST are set so that the weight is the bigram probability of the output word given the context specified by the from state, and the output word is a word of the vocabulary. [sent-82, score-0.314]
</p><p>33 2  Noise models  For our noise model, we created a weighted finitestate transducer (wFST) which accepts error-free input, and outputs erroneous sentences with a specified probability. [sent-87, score-0.591]
</p><p>34 936errors, we created several different noise models  and  Figure 2: Example of noise model composed them together, creating a layered noise model. [sent-89, score-0.95]
</p><p>35 The noise models we implement are spelling errors, article choice errors, preposition choice errors, and insertion errors, which we will explain in more detail later in this section. [sent-90, score-0.911]
</p><p>36 The basic design of each noise wFST starts with an initial state, which is also the final state of the  wFST. [sent-91, score-0.336]
</p><p>37 For each word found in the language model, an arc going from the initial state to itself is created, with the input and output values set as the word. [sent-92, score-0.278]
</p><p>38 These arcs model the case of no error being made. [sent-93, score-0.286]
</p><p>39 For example, in the article choice error model, an arc is added for each possible (input, output) article pair, such as a:an for making the mistake of writing an instead of a. [sent-95, score-0.528]
</p><p>40 For example, the noise model shown in Figure 2 shows a noise model in which a will be written correctly with a probability of 0. [sent-97, score-0.72]
</p><p>41 1 Spelling errors The spelling error noise model accounts for spelling errors made by writers. [sent-106, score-1.17]
</p><p>42 For spelling errors, we allowed all spelling errors which were a Damerau-Levenshtein distance of 1 (Damerau,  1964; Levenshtein, 1966). [sent-107, score-0.525]
</p><p>43 This parameter is the total probability of making a spelling error distributed the probability of each possible spelling error equally. [sent-110, score-0.588]
</p><p>44 2 Article choice errors The article choice error noise model simulates incorrect selection of articles. [sent-115, score-1.068]
</p><p>45 3 Preposition choice errors The preposition choice error noise model simulates incorrect selection of prepositions. [sent-121, score-1.084]
</p><p>46 , 2009) and specify one parameter for each preposition pair, as we do in the article choice error noise model, giving us a total of 132 parameters. [sent-123, score-0.729]
</p><p>47 4 Wordform choice errors The wordform choice error noise model simulates choosing the incorrect wordform of a word. [sent-126, score-1.207]
</p><p>48 5 Word insertion errors The word insertion error model simulates the addition of extraneous words to the original sentence. [sent-139, score-0.513]
</p><p>49 We create a list of words by combining the prepo-  sitions and articles found in the article choice and preposition choice errors. [sent-140, score-0.386]
</p><p>50 3 Learning noise model parameters To achieve maximum performance, we wish to learn the parameters of the noise models. [sent-146, score-0.773]
</p><p>51 If we had a large set of erroneous sentences, along with a handannotated list of the specific errors and their corrections, it would be possible to do some form of supervised learning to find the parameters. [sent-147, score-0.322]
</p><p>52 The Chinese Learner English Corpus (CLEC) contains erroneous sentences which have been annotated, but the CLEC corpus had too many manual errors, such as typos, as well  ×  as many incorrect annotations, making it very difficult to automate the processing. [sent-152, score-0.34]
</p><p>53 Instead, we collected a large data set of possibly erroneous sentences from Korean ESL students (Section 5. [sent-155, score-0.282]
</p><p>54 To learn the parameters of the noise models, we assume that the collected sentences are random output of our model, and train our model using the EM algorithm. [sent-158, score-0.533]
</p><p>55 The V -expectation semiring is a semiring in which the weight is defined as R≥0 V , where R can be used to keep track of the probability, aenrde RV iasn a vee ucsteodr which can be used to denote arc traversal counts or feature counts. [sent-160, score-0.339]
</p><p>56 The weight for each of the arcs in the noise models was set so that the real value was the probability and the vector V denoted which choice (having a specified error or not) was made by selecting the arc. [sent-161, score-0.656]
</p><p>57 We create a generative language-noise  model by composing the language model wFST with the noise model wFSTs, as shown in Figure 3. [sent-162, score-0.49]
</p><p>58 ,0 3]21eca rt:eca rt/1 43ε :ε /1 5 Figure 3: Example of language model (top) and noise model (middle) wFST composition. [sent-173, score-0.425]
</p><p>59 The first value of the vector denotes no error being made on writing ‘a’ and the second value denotes the error of writing ‘an’ instead of ‘a’ arc or non-erroneous arc. [sent-175, score-0.425]
</p><p>60 Once our model is set up for the E step using the initial parameters, we must compute the expected number of noise model arc traversals for use in calculating our new parameters. [sent-176, score-0.524]
</p><p>61 Then, for each possible path, we need to calculate the probability of the path given the output sentence, and get the expected counts of going over each erroneous and error-free arc to learn the parameters ofthe noise model. [sent-178, score-0.744]
</p><p>62 4 Finding the maximum likelihood correction Once the parameters are learned, we can use our model to find the maximum likelihood error-free sentence. [sent-192, score-0.414]
</p><p>63 This is done by again creating the language model and noise model with the learned parameters, but this time we set the weights of the noise model to just the probabilities, using the log  semiring, since we do not need to keep track of expected values. [sent-193, score-0.785]
</p><p>64 Once again, we compose the language model with the noise models. [sent-195, score-0.36]
</p><p>65 We create a sentence wFST using the observed sentence we wish to correct, the same way the observed sentence wFST for training was created. [sent-196, score-0.294]
</p><p>66 1 Data Set To train our noise models, we collected around 25,000 essays comprised of 478,350 sentences written by Korean ESL students preparing for the TOEFL writing exam. [sent-201, score-0.471]
</p><p>67 2 Evaluation technique In the current literature, grammar correction tasks are often manually evaluated for each output correction, or evaluated by taking a set of proper sentences, artificially introducing some error, and seeing how well the algorithm fixes the error. [sent-215, score-0.445]
</p><p>68 Thus, this method of evaluation, which may be suitable for evaluating the correction performance of specific grammatical errors, would not be fit for evaluating our model’s overall performance. [sent-218, score-0.348]
</p><p>69 The task of correcting erroneous sentences can also be thought of as translating a sentence from a given language A, to another language B, where A is a broken language, and B is the correct language. [sent-222, score-0.381]
</p><p>70 To obtain manually corrected sentences for evaluation, the test and evaluation set sentences and were put on Amazon Mechanical Turk as a correction task. [sent-229, score-0.569]
</p><p>71 Workers had a choice of selecting ‘Impossible to understand’ , ‘Correct sentence’, or ‘Incorrect sentence’, and were asked to correct the sentences so no spelling errors, grammatical errors, or punctuation errors were present. [sent-231, score-0.644]
</p><p>72 Each sentence was given to 8 workers, giving us a set of 8 or fewer corrected sentences for each erroneous sentence. [sent-232, score-0.451]
</p><p>73 Using our manually corrected reference sentences, we evaluate our model’s correction performance using METEOR and BLEU. [sent-237, score-0.423]
</p><p>74 While these two evaluation methods were created for machine translation, they also have the potential of being used in the field of grammar correction evaluation. [sent-239, score-0.404]
</p><p>75 In this respect, evaluation of grammar correction should be more strict. [sent-241, score-0.404]
</p><p>76 78L57E48U06 Table 1: BLEU and METEOR scores for ESL sentences vs manual corrections on 100 randomly chosen sentences  SpellinAgns poieslel modelM00. [sent-246, score-0.382]
</p><p>77 771L292E73U1833 Table 2: Aspell vs Spelling noise model corrected sentences minus the correction sentence being evaluated. [sent-250, score-0.912]
</p><p>78 For example, let us say we have the observed sentence o, and correction sentences c1, c2, c3 and c4 from Mechanical Turk. [sent-251, score-0.482]
</p><p>79 We repeat the process for o and c2, using c1, c3 and c4 as the reference, and so on, until we have run METEOR and BLEU on all 4 correction sentences. [sent-253, score-0.29]
</p><p>80 It is also notable that finding corrections for the sentences is a much easier task than finding various correct translations, since the task of editing is much easier and can be done by a much larger set of qualified people. [sent-261, score-0.41]
</p><p>81 1 Comparison with Aspell To check how well our spelling error noise model is doing, we compared the results of using the spelling error noise model with the output results of using for each correction were evaluated using the set of940the GNU Aspell  0. [sent-266, score-1.639]
</p><p>82 Aspell lists the suggested spelling corrections of misspelled words in a ranked order, so we replaced each misspelled word found by Aspell with the word with the highest rank (lowest score) for the Aspell corrections. [sent-272, score-0.493]
</p><p>83 Thus our model can correct words which look correct by themselves, but seem to be incorrect due to the bigram context. [sent-274, score-0.355]
</p><p>84 1, the spelling error model increases the evaluation scores from the ESL baseline. [sent-289, score-0.359]
</p><p>85 Adding in the article choice error model and the word insertion error models in addition to the spelling error noise model increases the BLEU score performance of finding corrections. [sent-290, score-1.188]
</p><p>86 Upon observing the outputs of the corrections on the development set, we found that the corrections changing a to an were all correct. [sent-291, score-0.427]
</p><p>87 For the last correction, the manual corrections all changed the sentence to contain ‘many people could read a nonfiction book’, bringing down the evaluation score. [sent-296, score-0.457]
</p><p>88 Overall, the article corrections which were being made seemed to change the sentence for the better, or left it at the same quality. [sent-297, score-0.334]
</p><p>89 The preposition choice error model decreased the performance of the system overall. [sent-298, score-0.414]
</p><p>90 While the wordform choice noise model had the most sentences with increased scores, it also had the most sentences with decreased scores. [sent-307, score-0.752]
</p><p>91 The word insertion error model was restricted to articles and 12 prepositions, and thus did not make many changes, but was correct when it did. [sent-320, score-0.295]
</p><p>92 3 Limitations of the bigram language model Browsing through the development set data, we found that many of our model’s incorrect ‘corrections’ were the result of using a bigram model as our language model. [sent-325, score-0.387]
</p><p>93 It seems can keep track of this kind of information would increase the performance of the correction model by preventing these kinds of errors. [sent-341, score-0.355]
</p><p>94 7  Conclusion and future work  We have introduced a novel way of finding grammar and spelling corrections, which uses the EM algorithm to train the parameters of our noisy channel approach. [sent-342, score-0.452]
</p><p>95 For training our noise model, all that is required is finding erroneous data sets. [sent-345, score-0.448]
</p><p>96 Using only these data sets, we can train our noisy channel model, as we have shown using a bigram language model, and a wFST for our noise model. [sent-348, score-0.487]
</p><p>97 For evaluation, we have introduced a novel way of evaluating grammar corrections, using MT evaluation methods, which we have not seen in other grammar correction literature. [sent-350, score-0.518]
</p><p>98 The produced corrections show the restrictions of using a bigram language model. [sent-351, score-0.288]
</p><p>99 A technique for computer detection and correction of spelling errors. [sent-392, score-0.468]
</p><p>100 A classifierbased approach to preposition and determiner error correction in L2 English. [sent-399, score-0.503]

<p>Author: Y. Albert Park ; Roger Levy</p><p>Abstract: Automated grammar correction techniques have seen improvement over the years, but there is still much room for increased performance. Current correction techniques mainly focus on identifying and correcting a specific type of error, such as verb form misuse or preposition misuse, which restricts the corrections to a limited scope. We introduce a novel technique, based on a noisy channel model, which can utilize the whole sentence context to determine proper corrections. We show how to use the EM algorithm to learn the parameters of the noise model, using only a data set of erroneous sentences, given the proper language model. This frees us from the burden of acquiring a large corpora of corrected sentences. We also present a cheap and efficient way to provide automated evaluation re- sults for grammar corrections by using BLEU and METEOR, in contrast to the commonly used manual evaluations.</p><p>2 0.27286658 <a title="46-tfidf-2" href="./acl-2011-Algorithm_Selection_and_Model_Adaptation_for_ESL_Correction_Tasks.html">32 acl-2011-Algorithm Selection and Model Adaptation for ESL Correction Tasks</a></p>
<p>Author: Alla Rozovskaya ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of correcting errors made by English as a Second Language (ESL) writers and address two issues that are essential to making progress in ESL error correction - algorithm selection and model adaptation to the first language of the ESL learner. A variety of learning algorithms have been applied to correct ESL mistakes, but often comparisons were made between incomparable data sets. We conduct an extensive, fair comparison of four popular learning methods for the task, reversing conclusions from earlier evaluations. Our results hold for different training sets, genres, and feature sets. A second key issue in ESL error correction is the adaptation of a model to the first language ofthe writer. Errors made by non-native speakers exhibit certain regularities and, as we show, models perform much better when they use knowledge about error patterns of the nonnative writers.

<p>Author: Chung-chi Huang ; Mei-hua Chen ; Shih-ting Huang ; Jason S. Chang</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new method for learning to detect grammatical errors in learner’s writing and provide suggestions. The method involves parsing a reference corpus and inferring grammar patterns in the form of a sequence of content words, function words, and parts-of-speech (e.g., “play ~ role in Ving” and “look forward to Ving”). At runtime, the given passage submitted by the learner is matched using an extended Levenshtein algorithm against the set of pattern rules in order to detect errors and provide suggestions. We present a prototype implementation of the proposed method, EdIt, that can handle a broad range of errors. Promising results are illustrated with three common types of errors in nonnative writing. 1</p><p>5 0.17498326 <a title="46-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-A_Fast_and_Accurate_Method_for_Approximate_String_Search.html">11 acl-2011-A Fast and Accurate Method for Approximate String Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Ziqi Wang ; Gu Xu ; Hang Li ; Ming Zhang</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for approximate string search, specifically candidate generation in spelling error correction, which is a task as follows. Given a misspelled word, the system finds words in a dictionary, which are most “similar” to the misspelled word. The paper proposes a probabilistic approach to the task, which is both accurate and efficient. The approach includes the use of a log linear model, a method for training the model, and an algorithm for finding the top k candidates. The log linear model is defined as a conditional probability distribution of a corrected word and a rule set for the correction conditioned on the misspelled word. The learning method employs the criterion in candidate generation as loss function. The retrieval algorithm is efficient and is guaranteed to find the optimal k candidates. Experimental results on large scale data show that the proposed approach improves upon existing methods in terms of accuracy in different settings.</p><p>6 0.1657293 <a title="46-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Creating_a_manually_error-tagged_and_shallow-parsed_learner_corpus.html">88 acl-2011-Creating a manually error-tagged and shallow-parsed learner corpus</a></p>

<p>Author: Y. Albert Park ; Roger Levy</p><p>Abstract: Automated grammar correction techniques have seen improvement over the years, but there is still much room for increased performance. Current correction techniques mainly focus on identifying and correcting a specific type of error, such as verb form misuse or preposition misuse, which restricts the corrections to a limited scope. We introduce a novel technique, based on a noisy channel model, which can utilize the whole sentence context to determine proper corrections. We show how to use the EM algorithm to learn the parameters of the noise model, using only a data set of erroneous sentences, given the proper language model. This frees us from the burden of acquiring a large corpora of corrected sentences. We also present a cheap and efficient way to provide automated evaluation re- sults for grammar corrections by using BLEU and METEOR, in contrast to the commonly used manual evaluations.</p><p>2 0.82416844 <a title="46-lsi-2" href="./acl-2011-Algorithm_Selection_and_Model_Adaptation_for_ESL_Correction_Tasks.html">32 acl-2011-Algorithm Selection and Model Adaptation for ESL Correction Tasks</a></p>
<p>Author: Alla Rozovskaya ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of correcting errors made by English as a Second Language (ESL) writers and address two issues that are essential to making progress in ESL error correction - algorithm selection and model adaptation to the first language of the ESL learner. A variety of learning algorithms have been applied to correct ESL mistakes, but often comparisons were made between incomparable data sets. We conduct an extensive, fair comparison of four popular learning methods for the task, reversing conclusions from earlier evaluations. Our results hold for different training sets, genres, and feature sets. A second key issue in ESL error correction is the adaptation of a model to the first language ofthe writer. Errors made by non-native speakers exhibit certain regularities and, as we show, models perform much better when they use knowledge about error patterns of the nonnative writers. We propose a novel way to adapt a learned algorithm to the first language of the writer that is both cheaper to implement and performs better than other adaptation methods.</p><p>3 0.79110885 <a title="46-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-Grammatical_Error_Correction_with_Alternating_Structure_Optimization.html">147 acl-2011-Grammatical Error Correction with Alternating Structure Optimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Nitin Madnani ; Martin Chodorow ; Joel Tetreault ; Alla Rozovskaya</p><p>Abstract: Despite the rising interest in developing grammatical error detection systems for non-native speakers of English, progress in the field has been hampered by a lack of informative metrics and an inability to directly compare the performance of systems developed by different researchers. In this paper we address these problems by presenting two evaluation methodologies, both based on a novel use of crowdsourcing. 1 Motivation and Contributions One of the fastest growing areas in need of NLP tools is the field of grammatical error detection for learners of English as a Second Language (ESL). According to Guo and Beckett (2007), “over a billion people speak English as their second or for- eign language.” This high demand has resulted in many NLP research papers on the topic, a Synthesis Series book (Leacock et al., 2010) and a recurring workshop (Tetreault et al., 2010a), all in the last five years. In this year’s ACL conference, there are four long papers devoted to this topic. Despite the growing interest, two major factors encumber the growth of this subfield. First, the lack of consistent and appropriate score reporting is an issue. Most work reports results in the form of precision and recall as measured against the judgment of a single human rater. This is problematic because most usage errors (such as those in article and preposition usage) are a matter of degree rather than simple rule violations such as number agreement. As a consequence, it is common for two native speakers 508 to have different judgments of usage. Therefore, an appropriate evaluation should take this into account by not only enlisting multiple human judges but also aggregating these judgments in a graded manner. Second, systems are hardly ever compared to each other. In fact, to our knowledge, no two systems developed by different groups have been compared directly within the field primarily because there is no common corpus or shared task—both commonly found in other NLP areas such as machine translation.1 For example, Tetreault and Chodorow (2008), Gamon et al. (2008) and Felice and Pulman (2008) developed preposition error detection systems, but evaluated on three different corpora using different evaluation measures. The goal of this paper is to address the above issues by using crowdsourcing, which has been proven effective for collecting multiple, reliable judgments in other NLP tasks: machine translation (Callison-Burch, 2009; Zaidan and CallisonBurch, 2010), speech recognition (Evanini et al., 2010; Novotney and Callison-Burch, 2010), automated paraphrase generation (Madnani, 2010), anaphora resolution (Chamberlain et al., 2009), word sense disambiguation (Akkaya et al., 2010), lexicon construction for less commonly taught languages (Irvine and Klementiev, 2010), fact mining (Wang and Callison-Burch, 2010) and named entity recognition (Finin et al., 2010) among several others. In particular, we make a significant contribution to the field by showing how to leverage crowdsourc1There has been a recent proposal for a related shared task (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2010) that shows promise. Proceedings ofP thoer t4l9atnhd A, Onrnuegaoln M,e Jeuntineg 19 o-f2 t4h,e 2 A0s1s1o.c?i ac t2io0n11 fo Ar Cssoocmiaptuiotanti foonra Clo Lminpguutiast i ocns:aslh Loirntpgaupisetrics , pages 508–513, ing to both address the lack ofappropriate evaluation metrics and to make system comparison easier. Our solution is general enough for, in the simplest case, intrinsically evaluating a single system on a single dataset and, more realistically, comparing two different systems (from same or different groups). 2 A Case Study: Extraneous Prepositions We consider the problem of detecting an extraneous preposition error, i.e., incorrectly using a preposition where none is licensed. In the sentence “They came to outside”, the preposition to is an extraneous error whereas in the sentence “They arrived to the town” the preposition to is a confusion error (cf. arrived in the town). Most work on automated correction of preposition errors, with the exception of Gamon (2010), addresses preposition confusion errors e.g., (Felice and Pulman, 2008; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010b). One reason is that in addition to the standard context-based features used to detect confusion errors, identifying extraneous prepositions also requires actual knowledge of when a preposition can and cannot be used. Despite this lack of attention, extraneous prepositions account for a significant proportion—as much as 18% in essays by advanced English learners (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010a)—of all preposition usage errors. 2.1 Data and Systems For the experiments in this paper, we chose a proprietary corpus of about 500,000 essays written by ESL students for Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL?R). Despite being common ESL errors, preposition errors are still infrequent overall, with over 90% of prepositions being used correctly (Leacock et al., 2010; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010a). Given this fact about error sparsity, we needed an efficient method to extract a good number of error instances (for statistical reliability) from the large essay corpus. We found all trigrams in our essays containing prepositions as the middle word (e.g., marry with her) and then looked up the counts of each tri- gram and the corresponding bigram with the preposition removed (marry her) in the Google Web1T 5-gram Corpus. If the trigram was unattested or had a count much lower than expected based on the bi509 gram count, then we manually inspected the trigram to see whether it was actually an error. If it was, we extracted a sentence from the large essay corpus containing this erroneous trigram. Once we had extracted 500 sentences containing extraneous preposition error instances, we added 500 sentences containing correct instances of preposition usage. This yielded a corpus of 1000 sentences with a 50% error rate. These sentences, with the target preposition highlighted, were presented to 3 expert annotators who are native English speakers. They were asked to annotate the preposition usage instance as one of the following: extraneous (Error), not extraneous (OK) or too hard to decide (Unknown); the last category was needed for cases where the context was too messy to make a decision about the highlighted preposition. On average, the three experts had an agreement of 0.87 and a kappa of 0.75. For subse- quent analysis, we only use the classes Error and OK since Unknown was used extremely rarely and never by all 3 experts for the same sentence. We used two different error detection systems to illustrate our evaluation methodology:2 • • 3 LM: A 4-gram language model trained on tLhMe Google Wme lba1nTg 5-gram Corpus dw oithn SRILM (Stolcke, 2002).

Crowdsourcing Recently,we showed that Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) is a cheap and effective alternative to expert raters for annotating preposition errors (Tetreault et al., 2010b). In other current work, we have extended this pilot study to show that CrowdFlower, a crowdsourcing service that allows for stronger quality con- × trol on untrained human raters (henceforth, Turkers), is more reliable than AMT on three different error detection tasks (article errors, confused prepositions 2Any conclusions drawn in this paper pertain only to these specific instantiations of the two systems. & extraneous prepositions). To impose such quality control, one has to provide “gold” instances, i.e., examples with known correct judgments that are then used to root out any Turkers with low performance on these instances. For all three tasks, we obtained 20 Turkers’ judgments via CrowdFlower for each instance and found that, on average, only 3 Turkers were required to match the experts. More specifically, for the extraneous preposition error task, we used 75 sentences as gold and obtained judgments for the remaining 923 non-gold sentences.3 We found that if we used 3 Turker judgments in a majority vote, the agreement with any one of the three expert raters is, on average, 0.87 with a kappa of 0.76. This is on par with the inter-expert agreement and kappa found earlier (0.87 and 0.75 respectively). The extraneous preposition annotation cost only $325 (923 judgments 20 Turkers) and was com- pleted 9in2 a single day. T 2h0e only rres)st arnicdtio wna on tmheTurkers was that they be physically located in the USA. For the analysis in subsequent sections, we use these 923 sentences and the respective 20 judgments obtained via CrowdFlower. The 3 expert judgments are not used any further in this analysis. 4 Revamping System Evaluation In this section, we provide details on how crowdsourcing can help revamp the evaluation of error detection systems: (a) by providing more informative measures for the intrinsic evaluation of a single system (§ 4. 1), and (b) by easily enabling system comparison (§ 4.2). 4.1 Crowd-informed Evaluation Measures When evaluating the performance of grammatical error detection systems against human judgments, the judgments for each instance are generally reduced to the single most frequent category: Error or OK. This reduction is not an accurate reflection of a complex phenomenon. It discards valuable information about the acceptability of usage because it treats all “bad” uses as equal (and all good ones as equal), when they are not. Arguably, it would be fairer to use a continuous scale, such as the proportion of raters who judge an instance as correct or 3We found 2 duplicate sentences and removed them. 510 incorrect. For example, if 90% of raters agree on a rating of Error for an instance of preposition usage, then that is stronger evidence that the usage is an error than if 56% of Turkers classified it as Error and 44% classified it as OK (the sentence “In addition classmates play with some game and enjoy” is an example). The regular measures of precision and recall would be fairer if they reflected this reality. Besides fairness, another reason to use a continuous scale is that of stability, particularly with a small number of instances in the evaluation set (quite common in the field). By relying on majority judgments, precision and recall measures tend to be unstable (see below). We modify the measures of precision and recall to incorporate distributions of correctness, obtained via crowdsourcing, in order to make them fairer and more stable indicators of system performance. Given an error detection system that classifies a sentence containing a specific preposition as Error (class 1) if the preposition is extraneous and OK (class 0) otherwise, we propose the following weighted versions of hits (Hw), misses (Mw) and false positives (FPw): XN Hw = X(csiys ∗ picrowd) (1) Xi XN Mw = X((1 − csiys) ∗ picrowd) (2) Xi XN FPw = X(csiys ∗ (1 − picrowd)) (3) Xi In the above equations, N is the total number of instances, csiys is the class (1 or 0) , and picrowd indicates the proportion of the crowd that classified instance i as Error. Note that if we were to revert to the majority crowd judgment as the sole judgment for each instance, instead of proportions, picrowd would always be either 1 or 0 and the above formulae would simply compute the normal hits, misses and false positives. Given these definitions, weighted precision can be defined as Precisionw = Hw/(Hw Hw/(Hw + FPw) and weighted + Mw). recall as Recallw = agreement Figure 1: Histogram of Turker agreements for all 923 instances on whether a preposition is extraneous. UWnwei gihg tede Pr0 e.c9 i5s0i70onR0 .e3 c78al14l Table 1: Comparing commonly used (unweighted) and proposed (weighted) precision/recall measures for LM. To illustrate the utility of these weighted measures, we evaluated the LM and PERC systems on the dataset containing 923 preposition instances, against all 20 Turker judgments. Figure 1 shows a histogram of the Turker agreement for the majority rating over the set. Table 1 shows both the unweighted (discrete majority judgment) and weighted (continuous Turker proportion) versions of precision and recall for this system. The numbers clearly show that in the unweighted case, the performance of the system is overestimated simply because the system is getting as much credit for each contentious case (low agreement) as for each clear one (high agreement). In the weighted measure we propose, the contentious cases are weighted lower and therefore their contribution to the overall performance is reduced. This is a fairer representation since the system should not be expected to perform as well on the less reliable instances as it does on the clear-cut instances. Essentially, if humans cannot consistently decide whether 511 [n=93] [n=1 14] Agreement Bin [n=71 6] Figure 2: Unweighted precision/recall by agreement bins for LM & PERC. a case is an error then a system’s output cannot be considered entirely right or entirely wrong.4 As an added advantage, the weighted measures are more stable. Consider a contentious instance in a small dataset where 7 out of 15 Turkers (a minority) classified it as Error. However, it might easily have happened that 8 Turkers (a majority) classified it as Error instead of 7. In that case, the change in unweighted precision would have been much larger than is warranted by such a small change in the data. However, weighted precision is guaranteed to be more stable. Note that the instability decreases as the size of the dataset increases but still remains a problem. 4.2 Enabling System Comparison In this section, we show how to easily compare different systems both on the same data (in the ideal case of a shared dataset being available) and, more realistically, on different datasets. Figure 2 shows (unweighted) precision and recall of LM and PERC (computed against the majority Turker judgment) for three agreement bins, where each bin is defined as containing only the instances with Turker agreement in a specific range. We chose the bins shown 4The difference between unweighted and weighted measures can vary depending on the distribution of agreement. since they are sufficiently large and represent a reasonable stratification of the agreement space. Note that we are not weighting the precision and recall in this case since we have already used the agreement proportions to create the bins. This curve enables us to compare the two systems easily on different levels of item contentiousness and, therefore, conveys much more information than what is usually reported (a single number for unweighted precision/recall over the whole corpus). For example, from this graph, PERC is seen to have similar performance as LM for the 75-90% agreement bin. In addition, even though LM precision is perfect (1.0) for the most contentious instances (the 50-75% bin), this turns out to be an artifact of the LM classifier’s decision process. When it must decide between what it views as two equally likely possibilities, it defaults to OK. Therefore, even though LM has higher unweighted precision (0.957) than PERC (0.813), it is only really better on the most clear-cut cases (the 90-100% bin). If one were to report unweighted precision and recall without using any bins—as is the norm—this important qualification would have been harder to discover. While this example uses the same dataset for evaluating two systems, the procedure is general enough to allow two systems to be compared on two different datasets by simply examining the two plots. However, two potential issues arise in that case. The first is that the bin sizes will likely vary across the two plots. However, this should not be a significant problem as long as the bins are sufficiently large. A second, more serious, issue is that the error rates (the proportion of instances that are actually erroneous) in each bin may be different across the two plots. To handle this, we recommend that a kappa-agreement plot be used instead of the precision-agreement plot shown here. 5 Conclusions Our goal is to propose best practices to address the two primary problems in evaluating grammatical error detection systems and we do so by leveraging crowdsourcing. For system development, we rec- ommend that rather than compressing multiple judgments down to the majority, it is better to use agreement proportions to weight precision and recall to 512 yield fairer and more stable indicators of performance. For system comparison, we argue that the best solution is to use a shared dataset and present the precision-agreement plot using a set of agreed-upon bins (possibly in conjunction with the weighted precision and recall measures) for a more informative comparison. However, we recognize that shared datasets are harder to create in this field (as most of the data is proprietary). Therefore, we also provide a way to compare multiple systems across different datasets by using kappa-agreement plots. As for agreement bins, we posit that the agreement values used to define them depend on the task and, therefore, should be determined by the community. Note that both of these practices can also be implemented by using 20 experts instead of 20 Turkers. However, we show that crowdsourcing yields judgments that are as good but without the cost. To facilitate the adoption of these practices, we make all our evaluation code and data available to the com- munity.5 Acknowledgments We would first like to thank our expert annotators Sarah Ohls and Waverely VanWinkle for their hours of hard work.

<p>Author: Chung-chi Huang ; Mei-hua Chen ; Shih-ting Huang ; Jason S. Chang</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new method for learning to detect grammatical errors in learner’s writing and provide suggestions. The method involves parsing a reference corpus and inferring grammar patterns in the form of a sequence of content words, function words, and parts-of-speech (e.g., “play ~ role in Ving” and “look forward to Ving”). At runtime, the given passage submitted by the learner is matched using an extended Levenshtein algorithm against the set of pattern rules in order to detect errors and provide suggestions. We present a prototype implementation of the proposed method, EdIt, that can handle a broad range of errors. Promising results are illustrated with three common types of errors in nonnative writing. 1</p><p>6 0.7055015 <a title="46-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Creating_a_manually_error-tagged_and_shallow-parsed_learner_corpus.html">88 acl-2011-Creating a manually error-tagged and shallow-parsed learner corpus</a></p>

<p>Author: Anja Belz ; Eric Kow</p><p>Abstract: Studies assessing rating scales are very common in psychology and related fields, but are rare in NLP. In this paper we assess discrete and continuous scales used for measuring quality assessments of computergenerated language. We conducted six separate experiments designed to investigate the validity, reliability, stability, interchangeability and sensitivity of discrete vs. continuous scales. We show that continuous scales are viable for use in language evaluation, and offer distinct advantages over discrete scales. 1 Background and Introduction Rating scales have been used for measuring human perception of various stimuli for a long time, at least since the early 20th century (Freyd, 1923). First used in psychology and psychophysics, they are now also common in a variety of other disciplines, including NLP. Discrete scales are the only type of scale commonly used for qualitative assessments of computer-generated language in NLP (e.g. in the DUC/TAC evaluation competitions). Continuous scales are commonly used in psychology and related fields, but are virtually unknown in NLP. While studies assessing the quality of individual scales and comparing different types of rating scales are common in psychology and related fields, such studies hardly exist in NLP, and so at present little is known about whether discrete scales are a suitable rating tool for NLP evaluation tasks, or whether continuous scales might provide a better alternative. A range of studies from sociology, psychophysiology, biometrics and other fields have compared 230 Kow} @bright on .ac .uk discrete and continuous scales. Results tend to differ for different types of data. E.g., results from pain measurement show a continuous scale to outperform a discrete scale (ten Klooster et al., 2006). Other results (Svensson, 2000) from measuring students’ ease of following lectures show a discrete scale to outperform a continuous scale. When measuring dyspnea, Lansing et al. (2003) found a hybrid scale to perform on a par with a discrete scale. Another consideration is the types of data produced by discrete and continuous scales. Parametric methods of statistical analysis, which are far more sensitive than non-parametric ones, are commonly applied to both discrete and continuous data. However, parametric methods make very strong assumptions about data, including that it is numerical and normally distributed (Siegel, 1957). If these assumptions are violated, then the significance of results is overestimated. Clearly, the numerical assumption does not hold for the categorial data produced by discrete scales, and it is unlikely to be normally distributed. Many researchers are happier to apply parametric methods to data from continuous scales, and some simply take it as read that such data is normally distributed (Lansing et al., 2003). Our aim in the present study was to systematically assess and compare discrete and continuous scales when used for the qualitative assessment of computer-generated language. We start with an overview of assessment scale types (Section 2). We describe the experiments we conducted (Sec- tion 4), the data we used in them (Section 3), and the properties we examined in our inter-scale comparisons (Section 5), before presenting our results Proceedings ofP thoer t4l9atnhd A, Onrnuegaoln M,e Jeuntineg 19 o-f2 t4h,e 2 A0s1s1o.c?i ac t2io0n11 fo Ar Cssoocmiaptuiotanti foonra Clo Lminpguutiastti ocns:aslh Loirntpgaupisetricss, pages 230–235, Q1: Grammaticality The summary should have no datelines, system-internal formatting, capitalization errors or obviously ungrammatical sentences (e.g., fragments, missing components) that make the text difficult to read. 1.

(Section 6), and some conclusions (Section 7). 2 Rating Scales With Verbal Descriptor Scales (VDSs), participants give responses on ordered lists of verbally described and/or numerically labelled response cate- gories, typically varying in number from 2 to 11 (Svensson, 2000). An example of a VDS used in NLP is shown in Figure 1. VDSs are used very widely in contexts where computationally generated language is evaluated, including in dialogue, summarisation, MT and data-to-text generation. Visual analogue scales (VASs) are far less common outside psychology and related areas than VDSs. Responses are given by selecting a point on a typically horizontal line (although vertical lines have also been used (Scott and Huskisson, 2003)), on which the two end points represent the extreme values of the variable to be measured. Such lines can be mono-polar or bi-polar, and the end points are labelled with an image (smiling/frowning face), or a brief verbal descriptor, to indicate which end of the line corresponds to which extreme of the variable. The labels are commonly chosen to represent a point beyond any response actually likely to be chosen by raters. There is only one examples of a VAS in NLP system evaluation that we are aware of (Gatt et al., 2009). Hybrid scales, known as a graphic rating scales, combine the features of VDSs and VASs, and are also used in psychology. Here, the verbal descriptors are aligned along the line of a VAS and the endpoints are typically unmarked (Svensson, 2000). We are aware of one example in NLP (Williams and Reiter, 2008); 231 Q1: Grammaticality The summary should have no datelines, system-internal formatting, capitalization errors or obviously ungrammatical sentences (e.g., fragments, missing components) that make the text difficult to read. extbreamdely excellent Figure 2: Evaluation of Grammaticality with alternative VAS scale (cf. Figure 1). Evaluation task for each summary text: evaluator selects a place on the line to represent quality of the summary in terms of the criterion. we did not investigate this scale in our study. We used the following two specific scale designs in our experiments: VDS-7: 7 response categories, numbered (7 = best) and verbally described (e.g. 7 = “perfectly fluent” for Fluency, and 7 = “perfectly clear” for Clarity). Response categories were presented in a vertical list, with the best category at the bottom. Each category had a tick-box placed next to it; the rater’s task was to tick the box by their chosen rating. VAS: a horizontal, bi-polar line, with no ticks on it, mapping to 0–100. In the image description tests, statements identified the left end as negative, the right end as positive; in the weather forecast tests, the positive end had a smiling face and the label “statement couldn’t be clearer/read better”; the negative end had a frowning face and the label “statement couldn’t be more unclear/read worse”. The raters’ task was to move a pointer (initially in the middle of the line) to the place corresponding to their rating. 3 Data Weather forecast texts: In one half of our evaluation experiments we used human-written and automatically generated weather forecasts for the same weather data. The data in our evaluations was for 22 different forecast dates and included outputs from 10 generator systems and one set of human forecasts. This data has also been used for comparative system evaluation in previous research (Langner, 2010; Angeli et al., 2010; Belz and Kow, 2009). The following are examples of weather forecast texts from the data: 1: S SE 2 8 -3 2 INCREAS ING 3 6-4 0 BY MID AF TERNOON 2 : S ’ LY 2 6-3 2 BACKING S SE 3 0 -3 5 BY AFTERNOON INCREAS ING 3 5 -4 0 GUSTS 5 0 BY MID EVENING Image descriptions: In the other half of our evaluations, we used human-written and automatically generated image descriptions for the same images. The data in our evaluations was for 112 different image sets and included outputs from 6 generator systems and 2 sets of human-authored descriptions. This data was originally created in the TUNA Project (van Deemter et al., 2006). The following is an example of an item from the corpus, consisting of a set of images and a description for the entity in the red frame: the smal l blue fan 4 Experimental Set-up 4.1 Evaluation criteria Fluency/Readability: Both the weather forecast and image description evaluation experiments used a quality criterion intended to capture ‘how well a piece of text reads’ , called Fluency in the latter, Readability in the former. Adequacy/Clarity: In the image description experiments, the second quality criterion was Adequacy, explained as “how clear the description is”, and “how easy it would be to identify the image from the description”. This criterion was called Clarity in the weather forecast experiments, explained as “how easy is it to understand what is being described”. 4.2 Raters In the image experiments we used 8 raters (native speakers) in each experiment, from cohorts of 3rdyear undergraduate and postgraduate students doing a degree in a linguistics-related subject. They were paid and spent about 1hour doing the experiment. In the weather forecast experiments, we used 22 raters in each experiment, from among academic staff at our own university. They were not paid and spent about 15 minutes doing the experiment. 232 4.3 Summary overview of experiments Weather VDS-7 (A): VDS-7 scale; weather forecast data; criteria: Readability and Clarity; 22 raters (university staff) each assessing 22 forecasts. Weather VDS-7 (B): exact repeat of Weather VDS-7 (A), including same raters. Weather VAS: VAS scale; 22 raters (university staff), no overlap with raters in Weather VDS-7 experiments; other details same as in Weather VDS-7. Image VDS-7: VDS-7 scale; image description data; 8 raters (linguistics students) each rating 112 descriptions; criteria: Fluency and Adequacy. Image VAS (A): VAS scale; 8 raters (linguistics students), no overlap with raters in Image VAS-7; other details same as in Image VDS-7 experiment. Image VAS (B): exact repeat of Image VAS (A), including same raters. 4.4 Design features common to all experiments In all our experiments we used a Repeated Latin Squares design to ensure that each rater sees the same number of outputs from each system and for each text type (forecast date/image set). Following detailed instructions, raters first did a small number of practice examples, followed by the texts to be rated, in an order randomised for each rater. Evaluations were carried out via a web interface. They were allowed to interrupt the experiment, and in the case of the 1hour long image description evaluation they were encouraged to take breaks. 5 Comparison and Assessment of Scales Validity is to the extent to which an assessment method measures what it is intended to measure (Svensson, 2000). Validity is often impossible to assess objectively, as is the case of all our criteria except Adequacy, the validity of which we can directly test by looking at correlations with the accuracy with which participants in a separate experiment identify the intended images given their descriptions. A standard method for assessing Reliability is Kendall’s W, a coefficient of concordance, measuring the degree to which different raters agree in their ratings. We report W for all 6 experiments. Stability refers to the extent to which the results of an experiment run on one occasion agree with the results of the same experiment (with the same raters) run on a different occasion. In the present study, we assess stability in an intra-rater, test-retest design, assessing the agreement between the same participant’s responses in the first and second runs of the test with Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient. We report these measures between ratings given in Image VAS (A) vs. those given in Image VAS (B), and between ratings given in Weather VDS-7 (A) vs. those given in Weather VDS-7 (B). We assess Interchangeability, that is, the extent to which our VDS and VAS scales agree, by computing Pearson’s and Spearman’s coefficients between results. We report these measures for all pairs of weather forecast/image description evaluations. We assess the Sensitivity of our scales by determining the number of significant differences between different systems and human authors detected by each scale. We also look at the relative effect of the different experimental factors by computing the F-Ratio for System (the main factor under investigation, so its relative effect should be high), Rater and Text Type (their effect should be low). F-ratios were de- termined by a one-way ANOVA with the evaluation criterion in question as the dependent variable and System, Rater or Text Type as grouping factors. 6 Results 6.1 Interchangeability and Reliability for system/human authored image descriptions Interchangeability: Pearson’s r between the means per system/human in the three image description evaluation experiments were as follows (Spearman’s ρ shown in brackets): Forb.eqAdFlouthV AD S d-(e7Aq)uac.y945a78n*d(V.F9A2l5uS8e*(—An *c)y,.98o36r.748*e1l9a*(tV.i98(Ao.2578nS019s(*5B b) e- tween Image VDS-7 and Image VAS (A) (the main VAS experiment) are extremely high, meaning that they could substitute for each other here.

Between ratings given by the same raters first in Weather VDS-7 (A) and then in Weather VDS-7 (B), Pearson’s r was .656 for Clarity, .704 for Readability. (All significant at p < .01.) Note that these are computed on individual scores (rather than means as in the correlation figures given in previous sections). 6.4 F-ratios and post-hoc analysis for image data The table below shows F-ratios determined by a oneway ANOVA with the evaluation criterion in question (Adequacy/Fluency) as the dependent variable and System/Rater/Text Type as the grouping factor. Note that for System a high F-ratio is desirable, but a low F-ratio is desirable for other factors. tem, the main factor under investigation, VDS-7 found 8 for Adequacy and 14 for Fluency; VAS (A) found 7 for Adequacy and 15 for Fluency. 6.5 F-ratios and post-hoc analysis for weather data The table below shows F-ratios analogous to the previous section (for Clarity/Readability). tem, VDS-7 (A) found 24 for Clarity, 23 for Readability; VAS found 25 for Adequacy, 26 for Fluency. 6.6 Scale validity test for image data Our final table of results shows Pearson’s correlation coefficients (calculated on means per system) between the Adequacy data from the three image description evaluation experiments on the one hand, and the data from an extrinsic experiment in which we measured the accuracy with which participants identified the intended image described by a description: ThecorIlm at iog ne V bAeDSt w-(A7eB)An dA eqd uqe ac uy a cy.I89nD720d 6AI*Dc .Acuray was strong and highly significant in all three image description evaluation experiments, but strongest in VAS (B), and weakest in VAS (A). For comparison, 234 Pearson’s between Fluency and ID Accuracy ranged between .3 and .5, whereas Pearson’s between Adequacy and ID Speed (also measured in the same image identfication experiment) ranged between -.35 and -.29. 7 Discussion and Conclusions Our interchangeability results (Sections 6. 1and 6.2) indicate that the VAS and VDS-7 scales we have tested can substitute for each other in our present evaluation tasks in terms of the mean system scores they produce. Where we were able to measure validity (Section 6.6), both scales were shown to be similarly valid, predicting image identification accuracy figures from a separate experiment equally well. Stability (Section 6.3) was marginally better for VDS-7 data, and Reliability (Sections 6.1 and 6.2) was better for VAS data in the image descrip- tion evaluations, but (mostly) better for VDS-7 data in the weather forecast evaluations. Finally, the VAS experiments found greater numbers of statistically significant differences between systems in 3 out of 4 cases (Section 6.5). Our own raters strongly prefer working with VAS scales over VDSs. This has also long been clear from the psychology literature (Svensson, 2000)), where raters are typically found to prefer VAS scales over VDSs which can be a “constant source of vexation to the conscientious rater when he finds his judgments falling between the defined points” (Champney, 1941). Moreover, if a rater’s judgment falls between two points on a VDS then they must make the false choice between the two points just above and just below their actual judgment. In this case we know that the point they end up selecting is not an accurate measure of their judgment but rather just one of two equally accurate ones (one of which goes unrecorded). Our results establish (for our evaluation tasks) that VAS scales, so far unproven for use in NLP, are at least as good as VDSs, currently virtually the only scale in use in NLP. Combined with the fact that raters strongly prefer VASs and that they are regarded as more amenable to parametric means of statistical analysis, this indicates that VAS scales should be used more widely for NLP evaluation tasks.

<p>Author: Andreas Maletti</p><p>Abstract: The local multi bottom-up tree transducer is introduced and related to the (non-contiguous) synchronous tree sequence substitution grammar. It is then shown how to obtain a weighted local multi bottom-up tree transducer from a bilingual and biparsed corpus. Finally, the problem of non-preservation of regularity is addressed. Three properties that ensure preservation are introduced, and it is discussed how to adjust the rule extraction process such that they are automatically fulfilled.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.88098121 <a title="46-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Automated_Whole_Sentence_Grammar_Correction_Using_a_Noisy_Channel_Model.html">46 acl-2011-Automated Whole Sentence Grammar Correction Using a Noisy Channel Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Y. Albert Park ; Roger Levy</p><p>Abstract: Automated grammar correction techniques have seen improvement over the years, but there is still much room for increased performance. Current correction techniques mainly focus on identifying and correcting a specific type of error, such as verb form misuse or preposition misuse, which restricts the corrections to a limited scope. We introduce a novel technique, based on a noisy channel model, which can utilize the whole sentence context to determine proper corrections. We show how to use the EM algorithm to learn the parameters of the noise model, using only a data set of erroneous sentences, given the proper language model. This frees us from the burden of acquiring a large corpora of corrected sentences. We also present a cheap and efficient way to provide automated evaluation re- sults for grammar corrections by using BLEU and METEOR, in contrast to the commonly used manual evaluations.</p><p>4 0.87667221 <a title="46-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Peeling_Back_the_Layers%3A_Detecting_Event_Role_Fillers_in_Secondary_Contexts.html">244 acl-2011-Peeling Back the Layers: Detecting Event Role Fillers in Secondary Contexts</a></p>
<p>Author: Ruihong Huang ; Ellen Riloff</p><p>Abstract: The goal of our research is to improve event extraction by learning to identify secondary role filler contexts in the absence of event keywords. We propose a multilayered event extraction architecture that progressively “zooms in” on relevant information. Our extraction model includes a document genre classifier to recognize event narratives, two types of sentence classifiers, and noun phrase classifiers to extract role fillers. These modules are organized as a pipeline to gradually zero in on event-related information. We present results on the MUC-4 event extraction data set and show that this model performs better than previous systems.</p><p>5 0.84541333 <a title="46-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Algorithm_Selection_and_Model_Adaptation_for_ESL_Correction_Tasks.html">32 acl-2011-Algorithm Selection and Model Adaptation for ESL Correction Tasks</a></p>
<p>Author: Alla Rozovskaya ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of correcting errors made by English as a Second Language (ESL) writers and address two issues that are essential to making progress in ESL error correction - algorithm selection and model adaptation to the first language of the ESL learner. A variety of learning algorithms have been applied to correct ESL mistakes, but often comparisons were made between incomparable data sets. We conduct an extensive, fair comparison of four popular learning methods for the task, reversing conclusions from earlier evaluations. Our results hold for different training sets, genres, and feature sets. A second key issue in ESL error correction is the adaptation of a model to the first language ofthe writer. Errors made by non-native speakers exhibit certain regularities and, as we show, models perform much better when they use knowledge about error patterns of the nonnative writers. We propose a novel way to adapt a learned algorithm to the first language of the writer that is both cheaper to implement and performs better than other adaptation methods.</p><p>6 0.83445942 <a title="46-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Gappy_Phrasal_Alignment_By_Agreement.html">141 acl-2011-Gappy Phrasal Alignment By Agreement</a></p>

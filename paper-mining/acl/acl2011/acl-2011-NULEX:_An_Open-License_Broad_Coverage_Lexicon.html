<p>Author: Dipanjan Das ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We describe a new approach to disambiguating semantic frames evoked by lexical predicates previously unseen in a lexicon or annotated data. Our approach makes use of large amounts of unlabeled data in a graph-based semi-supervised learning framework. We construct a large graph where vertices correspond to potential predicates and use label propagation to learn possible semantic frames for new ones. The label-propagated graph is used within a frame-semantic parser and, for unknown predicates, results in over 15% absolute improvement in frame identification accuracy and over 13% absolute improvement in full frame-semantic parsing F1 score on a blind test set, over a state-of-the-art supervised baseline.</p><p>4 0.088859968 <a title="229-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Identifying_the_Semantic_Orientation_of_Foreign_Words.html">162 acl-2011-Identifying the Semantic Orientation of Foreign Words</a></p>

<p>Author: Dmitriy Dligach ; Martha Palmer</p><p>Abstract: Active Learning (AL) is typically initialized with a small seed of examples selected randomly. However, when the distribution of classes in the data is skewed, some classes may be missed, resulting in a slow learning progress. Our contribution is twofold: (1) we show that an unsupervised language modeling based technique is effective in selecting rare class examples, and (2) we use this technique for seeding AL and demonstrate that it leads to a higher learning rate. The evaluation is conducted in the context of word sense disambiguation.</p><p>6 0.069447227 <a title="229-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Together_We_Can%3A_Bilingual_Bootstrapping_for_WSD.html">304 acl-2011-Together We Can: Bilingual Bootstrapping for WSD</a></p>

<p>Author: Tony Veale ; Yanfen Hao</p><p>Abstract: Large lexical resources, such as corpora and databases of Web ngrams, are a rich source of pre-fabricated phrases that can be reused in many different contexts. However, one must be careful in how these resources are used, and noted writers such as George Orwell have argued that the use of canned phrases encourages sloppy thinking and results in poor communication. Nonetheless, while Orwell prized home-made phrases over the readymade variety, there is a vibrant movement in modern art which shifts artistic creation from the production of novel artifacts to the clever reuse of readymades or objets trouvés. We describe here a system that makes creative reuse of the linguistic readymades in the Google ngrams. Our system, the Jigsaw Bard, thus owes more to Marcel Duchamp than to George Orwell. We demonstrate how textual readymades can be identified and harvested on a large scale, and used to drive a modest form of linguistic creativity. 1</p><p>3 0.62657386 <a title="229-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-Model-Portability_Experiments_for_Textual_Temporal_Analysis.html">222 acl-2011-Model-Portability Experiments for Textual Temporal Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Oleksandr Kolomiyets ; Steven Bethard ; Marie-Francine Moens</p><p>Abstract: We explore a semi-supervised approach for improving the portability of time expression recognition to non-newswire domains: we generate additional training examples by substituting temporal expression words with potential synonyms. We explore using synonyms both from WordNet and from the Latent Words Language Model (LWLM), which predicts synonyms in context using an unsupervised approach. We evaluate a state-of-the-art time expression recognition system trained both with and without the additional training examples using data from TempEval 2010, Reuters and Wikipedia. We find that the LWLM provides substantial improvements on the Reuters corpus, and smaller improvements on the Wikipedia corpus. We find that WordNet alone never improves performance, though intersecting the examples from the LWLM and WordNet provides more stable results for Wikipedia. 1</p><p>4 0.6133033 <a title="229-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Creative_Language_Retrieval%3A_A_Robust_Hybrid_of_Information_Retrieval_and_Linguistic_Creativity.html">89 acl-2011-Creative Language Retrieval: A Robust Hybrid of Information Retrieval and Linguistic Creativity</a></p>
<p>Author: Tony Veale</p><p>Abstract: Information retrieval (IR) and figurative language processing (FLP) could scarcely be more different in their treatment of language and meaning. IR views language as an open-ended set of mostly stable signs with which texts can be indexed and retrieved, focusing more on a text’s potential relevance than its potential meaning. In contrast, FLP views language as a system of unstable signs that can be used to talk about the world in creative new ways. There is another key difference: IR is practical, scalable and robust, and in daily use by millions of casual users. FLP is neither scalable nor robust, and not yet practical enough to migrate beyond the lab. This paper thus presents a mutually beneficial hybrid of IR and FLP, one that enriches IR with new operators to enable the non-literal retrieval of creative expressions, and which also transplants FLP into a robust, scalable framework in which practical applications of linguistic creativity can be implemented. 1</p><p>5 0.60119349 <a title="229-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Improving_Dependency_Parsing_with_Semantic_Classes.html">167 acl-2011-Improving Dependency Parsing with Semantic Classes</a></p>

<p>Author: Siwei Wang ; Gina-Anne Levow</p><p>Abstract: Verbal feedback is an important information source in establishing interactional rapport. However, predicting verbal feedback across languages is challenging due to languagespecific differences, inter-speaker variation, and the relative sparseness and optionality of verbal feedback. In this paper, we employ an approach combining classifier weighting and SMOTE algorithm oversampling to improve verbal feedback prediction in Arabic, English, and Spanish dyadic conversations. This approach improves the prediction of verbal feedback, up to 6-fold, while maintaining a high overall accuracy. Analyzing highly weighted features highlights widespread use of pitch, with more varied use of intensity and duration.</p><p>4 0.85975623 <a title="229-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Hierarchical_Reinforcement_Learning_and_Hidden_Markov_Models_for_Task-Oriented_Natural_Language_Generation.html">149 acl-2011-Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning and Hidden Markov Models for Task-Oriented Natural Language Generation</a></p>
<p>Author: Nina Dethlefs ; Heriberto Cuayahuitl</p><p>Abstract: Surface realisation decisions in language generation can be sensitive to a language model, but also to decisions of content selection. We therefore propose the joint optimisation of content selection and surface realisation using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). To this end, we suggest a novel reward function that is induced from human data and is especially suited for surface realisation. It is based on a generation space in the form of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Results in terms of task success and human-likeness suggest that our unified approach performs better than greedy or random baselines.</p><p>5 0.77166569 <a title="229-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Neutralizing_Linguistically_Problematic_Annotations_in_Unsupervised_Dependency_Parsing_Evaluation.html">230 acl-2011-Neutralizing Linguistically Problematic Annotations in Unsupervised Dependency Parsing Evaluation</a></p>
<p>Author: Roy Schwartz ; Omri Abend ; Roi Reichart ; Ari Rappoport</p><p>Abstract: Dependency parsing is a central NLP task. In this paper we show that the common evaluation for unsupervised dependency parsing is highly sensitive to problematic annotations. We show that for three leading unsupervised parsers (Klein and Manning, 2004; Cohen and Smith, 2009; Spitkovsky et al., 2010a), a small set of parameters can be found whose modification yields a significant improvement in standard evaluation measures. These parameters correspond to local cases where no linguistic consensus exists as to the proper gold annotation. Therefore, the standard evaluation does not provide a true indication of algorithm quality. We present a new measure, Neutral Edge Direction (NED), and show that it greatly reduces this undesired phenomenon.</p><p>6 0.75626338 <a title="229-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Hindi_to_Punjabi_Machine_Translation_System.html">151 acl-2011-Hindi to Punjabi Machine Translation System</a></p>

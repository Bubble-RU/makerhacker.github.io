<p>Author: Truc Vien T. Nguyen ; Alessandro Moschitti</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we extend distant supervision (DS) based on Wikipedia for Relation Extraction (RE) by considering (i) relations defined in external repositories, e.g. YAGO, and (ii) any subset of Wikipedia documents. We show that training data constituted by sentences containing pairs of named entities in target relations is enough to produce reliable supervision. Our experiments with state-of-the-art relation extraction models, trained on the above data, show a meaningful F1 of 74.29% on a manually annotated test set: this highly improves the state-of-art in RE using DS. Additionally, our end-to-end experiments demonstrated that our extractors can be applied to any general text document.</p><p>3 0.14435582 <a title="190-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Domain_Adaptation_by_Constraining_Inter-Domain_Variability_of_Latent_Feature_Representation.html">103 acl-2011-Domain Adaptation by Constraining Inter-Domain Variability of Latent Feature Representation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ivan Titov</p><p>Abstract: We consider a semi-supervised setting for domain adaptation where only unlabeled data is available for the target domain. One way to tackle this problem is to train a generative model with latent variables on the mixture of data from the source and target domains. Such a model would cluster features in both domains and ensure that at least some of the latent variables are predictive of the label on the source domain. The danger is that these predictive clusters will consist of features specific to the source domain only and, consequently, a classifier relying on such clusters would perform badly on the target domain. We introduce a constraint enforcing that marginal distributions of each cluster (i.e., each latent variable) do not vary significantly across domains. We show that this constraint is effec- tive on the sentiment classification task (Pang et al., 2002), resulting in scores similar to the ones obtained by the structural correspondence methods (Blitzer et al., 2007) without the need to engineer auxiliary tasks.</p><p>4 0.14172515 <a title="190-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Semi-supervised_latent_variable_models_for_sentence-level_sentiment_analysis.html">279 acl-2011-Semi-supervised latent variable models for sentence-level sentiment analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Oscar Tackstrom ; Ryan McDonald</p><p>Abstract: We derive two variants of a semi-supervised model for fine-grained sentiment analysis. Both models leverage abundant natural supervision in the form of review ratings, as well as a small amount of manually crafted sentence labels, to learn sentence-level sentiment classifiers. The proposed model is a fusion of a fully supervised structured conditional model and its partially supervised counterpart. This allows for highly efficient estimation and inference algorithms with rich feature definitions. We describe the two variants as well as their component models and verify experimentally that both variants give significantly improved results for sentence-level sentiment analysis compared to all baselines. 1 Sentence-level sentiment analysis In this paper, we demonstrate how combining coarse-grained and fine-grained supervision benefits sentence-level sentiment analysis an important task in the field of opinion classification and retrieval (Pang and Lee, 2008). Typical supervised learning approaches to sentence-level sentiment analysis rely on sentence-level supervision. While such fine-grained supervision rarely exist naturally, and thus requires labor intensive manual annotation effort (Wiebe et al., 2005), coarse-grained supervision is naturally abundant in the form of online review ratings. This coarse-grained supervision is, of course, less informative compared to fine-grained supervision, however, by combining a small amount of sentence-level supervision with a large amount of document-level supervision, we are able to substantially improve on the sentence-level classification task. Our work combines two strands of research: models for sentiment analysis that take document structure into account; – 569 Ryan McDonald Google, Inc., New York ryanmcd@ google com . and models that use latent variables to learn unobserved phenomena from that which can be observed. Exploiting document structure for sentiment analysis has attracted research attention since the early work of Pang and Lee (2004), who performed minimal cuts in a sentence graph to select subjective sentences. McDonald et al. (2007) later showed that jointly learning fine-grained (sentence) and coarsegrained (document) sentiment improves predictions at both levels. More recently, Yessenalina et al. (2010) described how sentence-level latent variables can be used to improve document-level prediction and Nakagawa et al. (2010) used latent variables over syntactic dependency trees to improve sentence-level prediction, using only labeled sentences for training. In a similar vein, Sauper et al. (2010) integrated generative content structure models with discriminative models for multi-aspect sentiment summarization and ranking. These approaches all rely on the availability of fine-grained annotations, but Ta¨ckstro¨m and McDonald (201 1) showed that latent variables can be used to learn fine-grained sentiment using only coarse-grained supervision. While this model was shown to beat a set of natural baselines with quite a wide margin, it has its shortcomings. Most notably, due to the loose constraints provided by the coarse supervision, it tends to only predict the two dominant fine-grained sentiment categories well for each document sentiment category, so that almost all sentences in positive documents are deemed positive or neutral, and vice versa for negative documents. As a way of overcoming these shortcomings, we propose to fuse a coarsely supervised model with a fully supervised model. Below, we describe two ways of achieving such a combined model in the framework of structured conditional latent variable models. Contrary to (generative) topic models (Mei et al., 2007; Titov and Proceedings ofP thoer t4l9atnhd A, Onrnuegaoln M,e Jeuntineg 19 o-f2 t4h,e 2 A0s1s1o.c?i ac t2io0n11 fo Ar Cssoocmiaptuiotanti foonra Clo Lminpguutiast i ocns:aslh Loirntpgaupisetrics , pages 569–574, Figure 1: a) Factor graph of the fully observed graphical model. b) Factor graph of the corresponding latent variable model. During training, shaded nodes are observed, while non-shaded nodes are unobserved. The input sentences si are always observed. Note that there are no factors connecting the document node, yd, with the input nodes, s, so that the sentence-level variables, ys, in effect form a bottleneck between the document sentiment and the input sentences. McDonald, 2008; Lin and He, 2009), structured conditional models can handle rich and overlapping features and allow for exact inference and simple gradient based estimation. The former models are largely orthogonal to the one we propose in this work and combining their merits might be fruitful. As shown by Sauper et al. (2010), it is possible to fuse generative document structure models and task specific structured conditional models. While we do model document structure in terms of sentiment transitions, we do not model topical structure. An interesting avenue for future work would be to extend the model of Sauper et al. (2010) to take coarse-grained taskspecific supervision into account, while modeling fine-grained task-specific aspects with latent variables. Note also that the proposed approach is orthogonal to semi-supervised and unsupervised induction of context independent (prior polarity) lexicons (Turney, 2002; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2009; Rao and Ravichandran, 2009; Velikovich et al., 2010). The output of such models could readily be incorporated as features in the proposed model. 1.1 Preliminaries Let d be a document consisting of n sentences, s = (si)in=1, with a document–sentence-sequence pair denoted d = (d, s). Let yd = (yd, ys) denote random variables1 the document level sentiment, yd, and the sequence of sentence level sentiment, = (ysi)in=1 . – ys 1We are abusing notation throughout by using the same symbols to refer to random variables and their particular assignments. 570 In what follows, we assume that we have access to two training sets: a small set of fully labeled instances, DF = {(dj, and a large set of ydj)}jm=f1, coarsely labeled instances DC = {(dj, yjd)}jm=fm+fm+c1. Furthermore, we assume that yd and all yis take values in {POS, NEG, NEU}. We focus on structured conditional models in the exponential family, with the standard parametrization pθ(yd,ys|s) = expnhφ(yd,ys,s),θi − Aθ(s)o</p><p>5 0.12857501 <a title="190-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-In-domain_Relation_Discovery_with_Meta-constraints_via_Posterior_Regularization.html">170 acl-2011-In-domain Relation Discovery with Meta-constraints via Posterior Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Harr Chen ; Edward Benson ; Tahira Naseem ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to discovering relations and their instantiations from a collection of documents in a single domain. Our approach learns relation types by exploiting meta-constraints that characterize the general qualities of a good relation in any domain. These constraints state that instances of a single relation should exhibit regularities at multiple levels of linguistic structure, including lexicography, syntax, and document-level context. We capture these regularities via the structure of our probabilistic model as well as a set of declaratively-specified constraints enforced during posterior inference. Across two domains our approach successfully recovers hidden relation structure, comparable to or outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we find that a small , set of constraints is applicable across the domains, and that using domain-specific constraints can further improve performance. 1</p><p>6 0.11471291 <a title="190-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Large-Scale_Cross-Document_Coreference_Using_Distributed_Inference_and_Hierarchical_Models.html">196 acl-2011-Large-Scale Cross-Document Coreference Using Distributed Inference and Hierarchical Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Sameer Singh ; Amarnag Subramanya ; Fernando Pereira ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: Cross-document coreference, the task of grouping all the mentions of each entity in a document collection, arises in information extraction and automated knowledge base construction. For large collections, it is clearly impractical to consider all possible groupings of mentions into distinct entities. To solve the problem we propose two ideas: (a) a distributed inference technique that uses parallelism to enable large scale processing, and (b) a hierarchical model of coreference that represents uncertainty over multiple granularities of entities to facilitate more effective approximate inference. To evaluate these ideas, we constructed a labeled corpus of 1.5 million disambiguated mentions in Web pages by selecting link anchors referring to Wikipedia entities. We show that the combination of the hierarchical model with distributed inference quickly obtains high accuracy (with error reduction of 38%) on this large dataset, demonstrating the scalability of our approach.</p><p>5 0.64763576 <a title="190-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-In-domain_Relation_Discovery_with_Meta-constraints_via_Posterior_Regularization.html">170 acl-2011-In-domain Relation Discovery with Meta-constraints via Posterior Regularization</a></p>

<p>Author: John Lee ; Jason Naradowsky ; David A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: Most previous studies of morphological disambiguation and dependency parsing have been pursued independently. Morphological taggers operate on n-grams and do not take into account syntactic relations; parsers use the “pipeline” approach, assuming that morphological information has been separately obtained. However, in morphologically-rich languages, there is often considerable interaction between morphology and syntax, such that neither can be disambiguated without the other. In this paper, we propose a discriminative model that jointly infers morphological properties and syntactic structures. In evaluations on various highly-inflected languages, this joint model outperforms both a baseline tagger in morphological disambiguation, and a pipeline parser in head selection.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.84348029 <a title="190-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Knowledge-Based_Weak_Supervision_for_Information_Extraction_of_Overlapping_Relations.html">190 acl-2011-Knowledge-Based Weak Supervision for Information Extraction of Overlapping Relations</a></p>
<p>Author: Raphael Hoffmann ; Congle Zhang ; Xiao Ling ; Luke Zettlemoyer ; Daniel S. Weld</p><p>Abstract: Information extraction (IE) holds the promise of generating a large-scale knowledge base from the Web’s natural language text. Knowledge-based weak supervision, using structured data to heuristically label a training corpus, works towards this goal by enabling the automated learning of a potentially unbounded number of relation extractors. Recently, researchers have developed multiinstance learning algorithms to combat the noisy training data that can come from heuristic labeling, but their models assume relations are disjoint — for example they cannot extract the pair Founded ( Jobs Apple ) and CEO-o f ( Jobs Apple ) . , , This paper presents a novel approach for multi-instance learning with overlapping relations that combines a sentence-level extrac- , tion model with a simple, corpus-level component for aggregating the individual facts. We apply our model to learn extractors for NY Times text using weak supervision from Freebase. Experiments show that the approach runs quickly and yields surprising gains in accuracy, at both the aggregate and sentence level.</p><p>3 0.80651462 <a title="190-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-An_Affect-Enriched_Dialogue_Act_Classification_Model_for_Task-Oriented_Dialogue.html">33 acl-2011-An Affect-Enriched Dialogue Act Classification Model for Task-Oriented Dialogue</a></p>
<p>Author: Kristy Boyer ; Joseph Grafsgaard ; Eun Young Ha ; Robert Phillips ; James Lester</p><p>Abstract: Dialogue act classification is a central challenge for dialogue systems. Although the importance of emotion in human dialogue is widely recognized, most dialogue act classification models make limited or no use of affective channels in dialogue act classification. This paper presents a novel affect-enriched dialogue act classifier for task-oriented dialogue that models facial expressions of users, in particular, facial expressions related to confusion. The findings indicate that the affectenriched classifiers perform significantly better for distinguishing user requests for feedback and grounding dialogue acts within textual dialogue. The results point to ways in which dialogue systems can effectively leverage affective channels to improve dialogue act classification. 1</p><p>4 0.80585563 <a title="190-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Event_Discovery_in_Social_Media_Feeds.html">121 acl-2011-Event Discovery in Social Media Feeds</a></p>
<p>Author: Edward Benson ; Aria Haghighi ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method for record extraction from social streams such as Twitter. Unlike typical extraction setups, these environments are characterized by short, one sentence messages with heavily colloquial speech. To further complicate matters, individual messages may not express the full relation to be uncovered, as is often assumed in extraction tasks. We develop a graphical model that addresses these problems by learning a latent set of records and a record-message alignment simultaneously; the output of our model is a set of canonical records, the values of which are consistent with aligned messages. We demonstrate that our approach is able to accurately induce event records from Twitter messages, evaluated against events from a local city guide. Our method achieves significant error reduction over baseline methods.1</p><p>5 0.80426973 <a title="190-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Turn-Taking_Cues_in_a_Human_Tutoring_Corpus.html">312 acl-2011-Turn-Taking Cues in a Human Tutoring Corpus</a></p>
<p>Author: Heather Friedberg</p><p>Abstract: Most spoken dialogue systems are still lacking in their ability to accurately model the complex process that is human turntaking. This research analyzes a humanhuman tutoring corpus in order to identify prosodic turn-taking cues, with the hopes that they can be used by intelligent tutoring systems to predict student turn boundaries. Results show that while there was variation between subjects, three features were significant turn-yielding cues overall. In addition, a positive relationship between the number of cues present and the probability of a turn yield was demonstrated. 1</p><p>6 0.80352777 <a title="190-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Model-Based_Aligner_Combination_Using_Dual_Decomposition.html">221 acl-2011-Model-Based Aligner Combination Using Dual Decomposition</a></p>

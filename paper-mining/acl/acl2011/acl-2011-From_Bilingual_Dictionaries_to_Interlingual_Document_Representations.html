<p>Author: Emmanuel Prochasson ; Pascale Fung</p><p>Abstract: We present a first known result of high precision rare word bilingual extraction from comparable corpora, using aligned comparable documents and supervised classification. We incorporate two features, a context-vector similarity and a co-occurrence model between words in aligned documents in a machine learning approach. We test our hypothesis on different pairs of languages and corpora. We obtain very high F-Measure between 80% and 98% for recognizing and extracting correct translations for rare terms (from 1to 5 occurrences). Moreover, we show that our system can be trained on a pair of languages and test on a different pair of languages, obtaining a F-Measure of 77% for the classification of Chinese-English translations using a training corpus of Spanish-French. Our method is therefore even potentially applicable to low resources languages without training data.</p><p>4 0.19911468 <a title="139-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-How_Much_Can_We_Gain_from_Supervised_Word_Alignment%3F.html">152 acl-2011-How Much Can We Gain from Supervised Word Alignment?</a></p>
<p>Author: Jinxi Xu ; Jinying Chen</p><p>Abstract: Word alignment is a central problem in statistical machine translation (SMT). In recent years, supervised alignment algorithms, which improve alignment accuracy by mimicking human alignment, have attracted a great deal of attention. The objective of this work is to explore the performance limit of supervised alignment under the current SMT paradigm. Our experiments used a manually aligned ChineseEnglish corpus with 280K words recently released by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). We treated the human alignment as the oracle of supervised alignment. The result is surprising: the gain of human alignment over a state of the art unsupervised method (GIZA++) is less than 1point in BLEU. Furthermore, we showed the benefit of improved alignment becomes smaller with more training data, implying the above limit also holds for large training conditions. 1</p><p>5 0.159583 <a title="139-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Model-Based_Aligner_Combination_Using_Dual_Decomposition.html">221 acl-2011-Model-Based Aligner Combination Using Dual Decomposition</a></p>
<p>Author: John DeNero ; Klaus Macherey</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised word alignment is most often modeled as a Markov process that generates a sentence f conditioned on its translation e. A similar model generating e from f will make different alignment predictions. Statistical machine translation systems combine the predictions of two directional models, typically using heuristic combination procedures like grow-diag-final. This paper presents a graphical model that embeds two directional aligners into a single model. Inference can be performed via dual decomposition, which reuses the efficient inference algorithms of the directional models. Our bidirectional model enforces a one-to-one phrase constraint while accounting for the uncertainty in the underlying directional models. The resulting alignments improve upon baseline combination heuristics in word-level and phrase-level evaluations.</p><p>6 0.14699478 <a title="139-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Unsupervised_Word_Alignment_with_Arbitrary_Features.html">325 acl-2011-Unsupervised Word Alignment with Arbitrary Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Bo Li ; Eric Gaussier ; Akiko Aizawa</p><p>Abstract: We study in this paper the problem of enhancing the comparability of bilingual corpora in order to improve the quality of bilingual lexicons extracted from comparable corpora. We introduce a clustering-based approach for enhancing corpus comparability which exploits the homogeneity feature of the corpus, and finally preserves most of the vocabulary of the original corpus. Our experiments illustrate the well-foundedness of this method and show that the bilingual lexicons obtained from the homogeneous corpus are of better quality than the lexicons obtained with previous approaches.</p><p>4 0.6554268 <a title="139-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Engkoo%3A_Mining_the_Web_for_Language_Learning.html">115 acl-2011-Engkoo: Mining the Web for Language Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew R. Scott ; Xiaohua Liu ; Ming Zhou ; Microsoft Engkoo Team</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents Engkoo 1, a system for exploring and learning language. It is built primarily by mining translation knowledge from billions of web pages - using the Internet to catch language in motion. Currently Engkoo is built for Chinese users who are learning English; however the technology itself is language independent and can be extended in the future. At a system level, Engkoo is an application platform that supports a multitude of NLP technologies such as cross language retrieval, alignment, sentence classification, and statistical machine translation. The data set that supports this system is primarily built from mining a massive set of bilingual terms and sentences from across the web. Specifically, web pages that contain both Chinese and English are discovered and analyzed for parallelism, extracted and formulated into clear term definitions and sample sentences. This approach allows us to build perhaps the world’s largest lexicon linking both Chinese and English together - at the same time covering the most up-to-date terms as captured by the net.</p><p>5 0.65215933 <a title="139-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Domain_Adaptation_for_Machine_Translation_by_Mining_Unseen_Words.html">104 acl-2011-Domain Adaptation for Machine Translation by Mining Unseen Words</a></p>

<p>Author: Percy Liang ; Michael Jordan ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Compositional question answering begins by mapping questions to logical forms, but training a semantic parser to perform this mapping typically requires the costly annotation of the target logical forms. In this paper, we learn to map questions to answers via latent logical forms, which are induced automatically from question-answer pairs. In tackling this challenging learning problem, we introduce a new semantic representation which highlights a parallel between dependency syntax and efficient evaluation of logical forms. On two standard semantic parsing benchmarks (GEO and JOBS), our system obtains the highest published accuracies, despite requiring no annotated logical forms.</p><p>4 0.61534739 <a title="139-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Confidence_Driven_Unsupervised_Semantic_Parsing.html">79 acl-2011-Confidence Driven Unsupervised Semantic Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Dan Goldwasser ; Roi Reichart ; James Clarke ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Current approaches for semantic parsing take a supervised approach requiring a considerable amount of training data which is expensive and difficult to obtain. This supervision bottleneck is one of the major difficulties in scaling up semantic parsing. We argue that a semantic parser can be trained effectively without annotated data, and introduce an unsupervised learning algorithm. The algorithm takes a self training approach driven by confidence estimation. Evaluated over Geoquery, a standard dataset for this task, our system achieved 66% accuracy, compared to 80% of its fully supervised counterpart, demonstrating the promise of unsupervised approaches for this task.</p><p>5 0.61356848 <a title="139-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Dr_Sentiment_Knows_Everything%21.html">105 acl-2011-Dr Sentiment Knows Everything!</a></p>
<p>Author: Amitava Das ; Sivaji Bandyopadhyay</p><p>Abstract: Sentiment analysis is one of the hot demanding research areas since last few decades. Although a formidable amount of research have been done, the existing reported solutions or available systems are still far from perfect or do not meet the satisfaction level of end users’ . The main issue is the various conceptual rules that govern sentiment and there are even more clues (possibly unlimited) that can convey these concepts from realization to verbalization of a human being. Human psychology directly relates to the unrevealed clues and governs the sentiment realization of us. Human psychology relates many things like social psychology, culture, pragmatics and many more endless intelligent aspects of civilization. Proper incorporation of human psychology into computational sentiment knowledge representation may solve the problem. In the present paper we propose a template based online interactive gaming technology, called Dr Sentiment to automatically create the PsychoSentiWordNet involving internet population.

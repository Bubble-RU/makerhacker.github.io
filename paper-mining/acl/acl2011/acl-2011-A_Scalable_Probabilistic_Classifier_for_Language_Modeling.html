<p>Author: Hinrich Schutze</p><p>Abstract: Building on earlier work that integrates different factors in language modeling, we view (i) backing off to a shorter history and (ii) class-based generalization as two complementary mechanisms of using a larger equivalence class for prediction when the default equivalence class is too small for reliable estimation. This view entails that the classes in a language model should be learned from rare events only and should be preferably applied to rare events. We construct such a model and show that both training on rare events and preferable application to rare events improve perplexity when compared to a simple direct interpolation of class-based with standard language models.</p><p>3 0.12191258 <a title="24-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Improved_Modeling_of_Out-Of-Vocabulary_Words_Using_Morphological_Classes.html">163 acl-2011-Improved Modeling of Out-Of-Vocabulary Words Using Morphological Classes</a></p>

<p>Author: Denis Filimonov ; Mary Harper</p><p>Abstract: In the face of sparsity, statistical models are often interpolated with lower order (backoff) models, particularly in Language Modeling. In this paper, we argue that there is a relation between the higher order and the backoff model that must be satisfied in order for the interpolation to be effective. We show that in n-gram models, the relation is trivially held, but in models that allow arbitrary clustering of context (such as decision tree models), this relation is generally not satisfied. Based on this insight, we also propose a generalization of linear interpolation which significantly improves the performance of a decision tree language model.</p><p>5 0.11223003 <a title="24-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Discriminative_Feature-Tied_Mixture_Modeling_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">100 acl-2011-Discriminative Feature-Tied Mixture Modeling for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Bing Xiang ; Abraham Ittycheriah</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel discriminative mixture model for statistical machine translation (SMT). We model the feature space with a log-linear combination ofmultiple mixture components. Each component contains a large set of features trained in a maximumentropy framework. All features within the same mixture component are tied and share the same mixture weights, where the mixture weights are trained discriminatively to maximize the translation performance. This approach aims at bridging the gap between the maximum-likelihood training and the discriminative training for SMT. It is shown that the feature space can be partitioned in a variety of ways, such as based on feature types, word alignments, or domains, for various applications. The proposed approach improves the translation performance significantly on a large-scale Arabic-to-English MT task.</p><p>6 0.088992558 <a title="24-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-An_Empirical_Investigation_of_Discounting_in_Cross-Domain_Language_Models.html">38 acl-2011-An Empirical Investigation of Discounting in Cross-Domain Language Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Greg Durrett ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the empirical behavior of ngram discounts within and across domains. When a language model is trained and evaluated on two corpora from exactly the same domain, discounts are roughly constant, matching the assumptions of modified Kneser-Ney LMs. However, when training and test corpora diverge, the empirical discount grows essentially as a linear function of the n-gram count. We adapt a Kneser-Ney language model to incorporate such growing discounts, resulting in perplexity improvements over modified Kneser-Ney and Jelinek-Mercer baselines.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.87932682 <a title="24-lsi-2" href="./acl-2011-A_Scalable_Probabilistic_Classifier_for_Language_Modeling.html">24 acl-2011-A Scalable Probabilistic Classifier for Language Modeling</a></p>

We develop a novel hidden Markov model incorporating sophisticated smoothing using a hierarchical Pitman-Yor processes prior, providing an elegant and principled means of incorporating lexical characteristics. Central to our approach is a new type-based sampling algorithm for hierarchical Pitman-Yor models in which we track fractional table counts. In an empirical evaluation we show that our model consistently out-performs the current state-of-the-art across 10 languages.</p><p>6 0.62197095 <a title="24-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Improved_Modeling_of_Out-Of-Vocabulary_Words_Using_Morphological_Classes.html">163 acl-2011-Improved Modeling of Out-Of-Vocabulary Words Using Morphological Classes</a></p>

<p>Author: John DeNero ; Klaus Macherey</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised word alignment is most often modeled as a Markov process that generates a sentence f conditioned on its translation e. A similar model generating e from f will make different alignment predictions. Statistical machine translation systems combine the predictions of two directional models, typically using heuristic combination procedures like grow-diag-final. This paper presents a graphical model that embeds two directional aligners into a single model. Inference can be performed via dual decomposition, which reuses the efficient inference algorithms of the directional models. Our bidirectional model enforces a one-to-one phrase constraint while accounting for the uncertainty in the underlying directional models. The resulting alignments improve upon baseline combination heuristics in word-level and phrase-level evaluations.</p><p>3 0.65682399 <a title="24-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Event_Discovery_in_Social_Media_Feeds.html">121 acl-2011-Event Discovery in Social Media Feeds</a></p>
<p>Author: Edward Benson ; Aria Haghighi ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method for record extraction from social streams such as Twitter. Unlike typical extraction setups, these environments are characterized by short, one sentence messages with heavily colloquial speech. To further complicate matters, individual messages may not express the full relation to be uncovered, as is often assumed in extraction tasks. We develop a graphical model that addresses these problems by learning a latent set of records and a record-message alignment simultaneously; the output of our model is a set of canonical records, the values of which are consistent with aligned messages. We demonstrate that our approach is able to accurately induce event records from Twitter messages, evaluated against events from a local city guide. Our method achieves significant error reduction over baseline methods.1</p><p>4 0.65668815 <a title="24-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Why_Initialization_Matters_for_IBM_Model_1%3A_Multiple_Optima_and_Non-Strict_Convexity.html">335 acl-2011-Why Initialization Matters for IBM Model 1: Multiple Optima and Non-Strict Convexity</a></p>
<p>Author: Kristina Toutanova ; Michel Galley</p><p>Abstract: Contrary to popular belief, we show that the optimal parameters for IBM Model 1 are not unique. We demonstrate that, for a large class of words, IBM Model 1 is indifferent among a continuum of ways to allocate probability mass to their translations. We study the magnitude of the variance in optimal model parameters using a linear programming approach as well as multiple random trials, and demonstrate that it results in variance in test set log-likelihood and alignment error rate.</p><p>5 0.65638584 <a title="24-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Unsupervised_Word_Alignment_with_Arbitrary_Features.html">325 acl-2011-Unsupervised Word Alignment with Arbitrary Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Chris Dyer ; Jonathan H. Clark ; Alon Lavie ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a discriminatively trained, globally normalized, log-linear variant of the lexical translation models proposed by Brown et al. (1993). In our model, arbitrary, nonindependent features may be freely incorporated, thereby overcoming the inherent limitation of generative models, which require that features be sensitive to the conditional independencies of the generative process. However, unlike previous work on discriminative modeling of word alignment (which also permits the use of arbitrary features), the parameters in our models are learned from unannotated parallel sentences, rather than from supervised word alignments. Using a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic measures, including translation performance, we show our model yields better alignments than generative baselines in a number of language pairs.</p><p>6 0.65392131 <a title="24-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Extracting_Social_Power_Relationships_from_Natural_Language.html">133 acl-2011-Extracting Social Power Relationships from Natural Language</a></p>

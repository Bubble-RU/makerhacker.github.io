We present a model that uses a mix of unsupervised and supervised techniques to learn word vectors capturing semanticterm–documentinformation as well as rich sentiment content. The proposed model can leverage both continuous and multi-dimensional sentiment information as well as non-sentiment annotations. We instantiate the model to utilize the document-level sentiment polarity annotations present in many online documents (e.g. star ratings). We evaluate the model using small, widely used sentiment and subjectivity corpora and find it out-performs several previously introduced methods for sentiment classification.

<p>Author: Danushka Bollegala ; David Weir ; John Carroll</p><p>Abstract: We describe a sentiment classification method that is applicable when we do not have any labeled data for a target domain but have some labeled data for multiple other domains, designated as the source domains. We automat- ically create a sentiment sensitive thesaurus using both labeled and unlabeled data from multiple source domains to find the association between words that express similar sentiments in different domains. The created thesaurus is then used to expand feature vectors to train a binary classifier. Unlike previous cross-domain sentiment classification methods, our method can efficiently learn from multiple source domains. Our method significantly outperforms numerous baselines and returns results that are better than or comparable to previous cross-domain sentiment classification methods on a benchmark dataset containing Amazon user reviews for different types of products.</p><p>5 0.35261226 <a title="253-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Sentiment_Analysis_of_Citations_using_Sentence_Structure-Based_Features.html">281 acl-2011-Sentiment Analysis of Citations using Sentence Structure-Based Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Awais Athar</p><p>Abstract: Sentiment analysis of citations in scientific papers and articles is a new and interesting problem due to the many linguistic differences between scientific texts and other genres. In this paper, we focus on the problem of automatic identification of positive and negative sentiment polarity in citations to scientific papers. Using a newly constructed annotated citation sentiment corpus, we explore the effectiveness of existing and novel features, including n-grams, specialised science-specific lexical features, dependency relations, sentence splitting and negation features. Our results show that 3-grams and dependencies perform best in this task; they outperform the sentence splitting, science lexicon and negation based features.</p><p>6 0.33957252 <a title="253-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-MemeTube%3A_A_Sentiment-based_Audiovisual_System_for_Analyzing_and_Displaying_Microblog_Messages.html">218 acl-2011-MemeTube: A Sentiment-based Audiovisual System for Analyzing and Displaying Microblog Messages</a></p>

<p>Author: Oscar Tackstrom ; Ryan McDonald</p><p>Abstract: We derive two variants of a semi-supervised model for fine-grained sentiment analysis. Both models leverage abundant natural supervision in the form of review ratings, as well as a small amount of manually crafted sentence labels, to learn sentence-level sentiment classifiers. The proposed model is a fusion of a fully supervised structured conditional model and its partially supervised counterpart. This allows for highly efficient estimation and inference algorithms with rich feature definitions. We describe the two variants as well as their component models and verify experimentally that both variants give significantly improved results for sentence-level sentiment analysis compared to all baselines. 1 Sentence-level sentiment analysis In this paper, we demonstrate how combining coarse-grained and fine-grained supervision benefits sentence-level sentiment analysis an important task in the field of opinion classification and retrieval (Pang and Lee, 2008). Typical supervised learning approaches to sentence-level sentiment analysis rely on sentence-level supervision. While such fine-grained supervision rarely exist naturally, and thus requires labor intensive manual annotation effort (Wiebe et al., 2005), coarse-grained supervision is naturally abundant in the form of online review ratings. This coarse-grained supervision is, of course, less informative compared to fine-grained supervision, however, by combining a small amount of sentence-level supervision with a large amount of document-level supervision, we are able to substantially improve on the sentence-level classification task. Our work combines two strands of research: models for sentiment analysis that take document structure into account; – 569 Ryan McDonald Google, Inc., New York ryanmcd@ google com . and models that use latent variables to learn unobserved phenomena from that which can be observed. Exploiting document structure for sentiment analysis has attracted research attention since the early work of Pang and Lee (2004), who performed minimal cuts in a sentence graph to select subjective sentences. McDonald et al. (2007) later showed that jointly learning fine-grained (sentence) and coarsegrained (document) sentiment improves predictions at both levels. More recently, Yessenalina et al. (2010) described how sentence-level latent variables can be used to improve document-level prediction and Nakagawa et al. (2010) used latent variables over syntactic dependency trees to improve sentence-level prediction, using only labeled sentences for training. In a similar vein, Sauper et al. (2010) integrated generative content structure models with discriminative models for multi-aspect sentiment summarization and ranking. These approaches all rely on the availability of fine-grained annotations, but Ta¨ckstro¨m and McDonald (201 1) showed that latent variables can be used to learn fine-grained sentiment using only coarse-grained supervision. While this model was shown to beat a set of natural baselines with quite a wide margin, it has its shortcomings. Most notably, due to the loose constraints provided by the coarse supervision, it tends to only predict the two dominant fine-grained sentiment categories well for each document sentiment category, so that almost all sentences in positive documents are deemed positive or neutral, and vice versa for negative documents. As a way of overcoming these shortcomings, we propose to fuse a coarsely supervised model with a fully supervised model. Below, we describe two ways of achieving such a combined model in the framework of structured conditional latent variable models. Contrary to (generative) topic models (Mei et al., 2007; Titov and Proceedings ofP thoer t4l9atnhd A, Onrnuegaoln M,e Jeuntineg 19 o-f2 t4h,e 2 A0s1s1o.c?i ac t2io0n11 fo Ar Cssoocmiaptuiotanti foonra Clo Lminpguutiast i ocns:aslh Loirntpgaupisetrics , pages 569–574, Figure 1: a) Factor graph of the fully observed graphical model. b) Factor graph of the corresponding latent variable model. During training, shaded nodes are observed, while non-shaded nodes are unobserved. The input sentences si are always observed. Note that there are no factors connecting the document node, yd, with the input nodes, s, so that the sentence-level variables, ys, in effect form a bottleneck between the document sentiment and the input sentences. McDonald, 2008; Lin and He, 2009), structured conditional models can handle rich and overlapping features and allow for exact inference and simple gradient based estimation. The former models are largely orthogonal to the one we propose in this work and combining their merits might be fruitful. As shown by Sauper et al. (2010), it is possible to fuse generative document structure models and task specific structured conditional models. While we do model document structure in terms of sentiment transitions, we do not model topical structure. An interesting avenue for future work would be to extend the model of Sauper et al. (2010) to take coarse-grained taskspecific supervision into account, while modeling fine-grained task-specific aspects with latent variables. Note also that the proposed approach is orthogonal to semi-supervised and unsupervised induction of context independent (prior polarity) lexicons (Turney, 2002; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2009; Rao and Ravichandran, 2009; Velikovich et al., 2010). The output of such models could readily be incorporated as features in the proposed model. 1.1 Preliminaries Let d be a document consisting of n sentences, s = (si)in=1, with a document–sentence-sequence pair denoted d = (d, s). Let yd = (yd, ys) denote random variables1 the document level sentiment, yd, and the sequence of sentence level sentiment, = (ysi)in=1 . – ys 1We are abusing notation throughout by using the same symbols to refer to random variables and their particular assignments. 570 In what follows, we assume that we have access to two training sets: a small set of fully labeled instances, DF = {(dj, and a large set of ydj)}jm=f1, coarsely labeled instances DC = {(dj, yjd)}jm=fm+fm+c1. Furthermore, we assume that yd and all yis take values in {POS, NEG, NEU}. We focus on structured conditional models in the exponential family, with the standard parametrization pθ(yd,ys|s) = expnhφ(yd,ys,s),θi − Aθ(s)o</p><p>5 0.61826015 <a title="253-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Learning_Word_Vectors_for_Sentiment_Analysis.html">204 acl-2011-Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Amitava Das ; Sivaji Bandyopadhyay</p><p>Abstract: Sentiment analysis is one of the hot demanding research areas since last few decades. Although a formidable amount of research have been done, the existing reported solutions or available systems are still far from perfect or do not meet the satisfaction level of end users’ . The main issue is the various conceptual rules that govern sentiment and there are even more clues (possibly unlimited) that can convey these concepts from realization to verbalization of a human being. Human psychology directly relates to the unrevealed clues and governs the sentiment realization of us. Human psychology relates many things like social psychology, culture, pragmatics and many more endless intelligent aspects of civilization. Proper incorporation of human psychology into computational sentiment knowledge representation may solve the problem. In the present paper we propose a template based online interactive gaming technology, called Dr Sentiment to automatically create the PsychoSentiWordNet involving internet population. The PsychoSentiWordNet is an extension of SentiWordNet that presently holds human psychological knowledge on a few aspects along with sentiment knowledge.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.79966313 <a title="253-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-PsychoSentiWordNet.html">253 acl-2011-PsychoSentiWordNet</a></p>

<p>Author: Long Jiang ; Mo Yu ; Ming Zhou ; Xiaohua Liu ; Tiejun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: Sentiment analysis on Twitter data has attracted much attention recently. In this paper, we focus on target-dependent Twitter sentiment classification; namely, given a query, we classify the sentiments of the tweets as positive, negative or neutral according to whether they contain positive, negative or neutral sentiments about that query. Here the query serves as the target of the sentiments. The state-ofthe-art approaches for solving this problem always adopt the target-independent strategy, which may assign irrelevant sentiments to the given target. Moreover, the state-of-the-art approaches only take the tweet to be classified into consideration when classifying the sentiment; they ignore its context (i.e., related tweets). However, because tweets are usually short and more ambiguous, sometimes it is not enough to consider only the current tweet for sentiment classification. In this paper, we propose to improve target-dependent Twitter sentiment classification by 1) incorporating target-dependent features; and 2) taking related tweets into consideration. According to the experimental results, our approach greatly improves the performance of target-dependent sentiment classification. 1</p><p>4 0.7055741 <a title="253-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Bayesian_Inference_for_Zodiac_and_Other_Homophonic_Ciphers.html">56 acl-2011-Bayesian Inference for Zodiac and Other Homophonic Ciphers</a></p>
<p>Author: Sujith Ravi ; Kevin Knight</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel Bayesian approach for deciphering complex substitution ciphers. Our method uses a decipherment model which combines information from letter n-gram language models as well as word dictionaries. Bayesian inference is performed on our model using an efficient sampling technique. We evaluate the quality of the Bayesian decipherment output on simple and homophonic letter substitution ciphers and show that unlike a previous approach, our method consistently produces almost 100% accurate decipherments. The new method can be applied on more complex substitution ciphers and we demonstrate its utility by cracking the famous Zodiac-408 cipher in a fully automated fashion, which has never been done before.</p><p>5 0.67661494 <a title="253-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-C-Feel-It%3A_A_Sentiment_Analyzer_for_Micro-blogs.html">64 acl-2011-C-Feel-It: A Sentiment Analyzer for Micro-blogs</a></p>
<p>Author: Aditya Joshi ; Balamurali AR ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya ; Rajat Mohanty</p><p>Abstract: Social networking and micro-blogging sites are stores of opinion-bearing content created by human users. We describe C-Feel-It, a system which can tap opinion content in posts (called tweets) from the micro-blogging website, Twitter. This web-based system categorizes tweets pertaining to a search string as positive, negative or objective and gives an aggregate sentiment score that represents a sentiment snapshot for a search string. We present a qualitative evaluation of this system based on a human-annotated tweet corpus.</p><p>6 0.66063917 <a title="253-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Lexical_Normalisation_of_Short_Text_Messages%3A_Makn_Sens_a_%23twitter.html">208 acl-2011-Lexical Normalisation of Short Text Messages: Makn Sens a #twitter</a></p>

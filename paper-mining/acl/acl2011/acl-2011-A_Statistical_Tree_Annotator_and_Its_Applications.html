<p>Author: Bing Zhao ; Young-Suk Lee ; Xiaoqiang Luo ; Liu Li</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel technique of learning how to transform the source parse trees to improve the translation qualities of syntax-based translation models using synchronous context-free grammars. We transform the source tree phrasal structure into a set of simpler structures, expose such decisions to the decoding process, and find the least expensive transformation operation to better model word reordering. In particular, we integrate synchronous binarizations, verb regrouping, removal of redundant parse nodes, and incorporate a few important features such as translation boundaries. We learn the structural preferences from the data in a generative framework. The syntax-based translation system integrating the proposed techniques outperforms the best Arabic-English unconstrained system in NIST08 evaluations by 1.3 absolute BLEU, which is statistically significant.</p><p>4 0.14237922 <a title="28-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Adjoining_Tree-to-String_Translation.html">30 acl-2011-Adjoining Tree-to-String Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yang Liu ; Qun Liu ; Yajuan Lu</p><p>Abstract: We introduce synchronous tree adjoining grammars (TAG) into tree-to-string translation, which converts a source tree to a target string. Without reconstructing TAG derivations explicitly, our rule extraction algorithm directly learns tree-to-string rules from aligned Treebank-style trees. As tree-to-string translation casts decoding as a tree parsing problem rather than parsing, the decoder still runs fast when adjoining is included. Less than 2 times slower, the adjoining tree-tostring system improves translation quality by +0.7 BLEU over the baseline system only allowing for tree substitution on NIST ChineseEnglish test sets.</p><p>5 0.13806884 <a title="28-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Binarized_Forest_to_String_Translation.html">61 acl-2011-Binarized Forest to String Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Hao Zhang ; Licheng Fang ; Peng Xu ; Xiaoyun Wu</p><p>Abstract: Tree-to-string translation is syntax-aware and efficient but sensitive to parsing errors. Forestto-string translation approaches mitigate the risk of propagating parser errors into translation errors by considering a forest of alternative trees, as generated by a source language parser. We propose an alternative approach to generating forests that is based on combining sub-trees within the first best parse through binarization. Provably, our binarization forest can cover any non-consitituent phrases in a sentence but maintains the desirable property that for each span there is at most one nonterminal so that the grammar constant for decoding is relatively small. For the purpose of reducing search errors, we apply the synchronous binarization technique to forest-tostring decoding. Combining the two techniques, we show that using a fast shift-reduce parser we can achieve significant quality gains in NIST 2008 English-to-Chinese track (1.3 BLEU points over a phrase-based system, 0.8 BLEU points over a hierarchical phrase-based system). Consistent and significant gains are also shown in WMT 2010 in the English to German, French, Spanish and Czech tracks.</p><p>6 0.13065565 <a title="28-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Parsing_the_Internal_Structure_of_Words%3A_A_New_Paradigm_for_Chinese_Word_Segmentation.html">241 acl-2011-Parsing the Internal Structure of Words: A New Paradigm for Chinese Word Segmentation</a></p>

<p>Author: Elias Ponvert ; Jason Baldridge ; Katrin Erk</p><p>Abstract: We consider a new subproblem of unsupervised parsing from raw text, unsupervised partial parsing—the unsupervised version of text chunking. We show that addressing this task directly, using probabilistic finite-state methods, produces better results than relying on the local predictions of a current best unsupervised parser, Seginer’s (2007) CCL. These finite-state models are combined in a cascade to produce more general (full-sentence) constituent structures; doing so outperforms CCL by a wide margin in unlabeled PARSEVAL scores for English, German and Chinese. Finally, we address the use of phrasal punctuation as a heuristic indicator of phrasal boundaries, both in our system and in CCL.</p><p>4 0.63218695 <a title="28-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Chinese_sentence_segmentation_as_comma_classification.html">66 acl-2011-Chinese sentence segmentation as comma classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Clifton McFate ; Kenneth Forbus</p><p>Abstract: Broad coverage lexicons for the English language have traditionally been handmade. This approach, while accurate, requires too much human labor. Furthermore, resources contain gaps in coverage, contain specific types of information, or are incompatible with other resources. We believe that the state of open-license technology is such that a comprehensive syntactic lexicon can be automatically compiled. This paper describes the creation of such a lexicon, NU-LEX, an open-license feature-based lexicon for general purpose parsing that combines WordNet, VerbNet, and Wiktionary and contains over 100,000 words. NU-LEX was integrated into a bottom up chart parser. We ran the parser through three sets of sentences, 50 sentences total, from the Simple English Wikipedia and compared its performance to the same parser using Comlex. Both parsers performed almost equally with NU-LEX finding all lex-items for 50% of the sentences and Comlex succeeding for 52%. Furthermore, NULEX’s shortcomings primarily fell into two categories, suggesting future research directions. 1</p><p>2 0.95966345 <a title="28-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Identifying_the_Semantic_Orientation_of_Foreign_Words.html">162 acl-2011-Identifying the Semantic Orientation of Foreign Words</a></p>
<p>Author: Ahmed Hassan ; Amjad AbuJbara ; Rahul Jha ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for identifying the positive or negative semantic orientation of foreign words. Identifying the semantic orientation of words has numerous applications in the areas of text classification, analysis of product review, analysis of responses to surveys, and mining online discussions. Identifying the semantic orientation of English words has been extensively studied in literature. Most of this work assumes the existence of resources (e.g. Wordnet, seeds, etc) that do not exist in foreign languages. In this work, we describe a method based on constructing a multilingual network connecting English and foreign words. We use this network to identify the semantic orientation of foreign words based on connection between words in the same language as well as multilingual connections. The method is experimentally tested using a manually labeled set of positive and negative words and has shown very promising results.</p><p>3 0.95928395 <a title="28-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Contrasting_Multi-Lingual_Prosodic_Cues_to_Predict_Verbal_Feedback_for_Rapport.html">83 acl-2011-Contrasting Multi-Lingual Prosodic Cues to Predict Verbal Feedback for Rapport</a></p>
<p>Author: Siwei Wang ; Gina-Anne Levow</p><p>Abstract: Verbal feedback is an important information source in establishing interactional rapport. However, predicting verbal feedback across languages is challenging due to languagespecific differences, inter-speaker variation, and the relative sparseness and optionality of verbal feedback. In this paper, we employ an approach combining classifier weighting and SMOTE algorithm oversampling to improve verbal feedback prediction in Arabic, English, and Spanish dyadic conversations. This approach improves the prediction of verbal feedback, up to 6-fold, while maintaining a high overall accuracy. Analyzing highly weighted features highlights widespread use of pitch, with more varied use of intensity and duration.</p><p>4 0.94900584 <a title="28-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Hierarchical_Reinforcement_Learning_and_Hidden_Markov_Models_for_Task-Oriented_Natural_Language_Generation.html">149 acl-2011-Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning and Hidden Markov Models for Task-Oriented Natural Language Generation</a></p>
<p>Author: Nina Dethlefs ; Heriberto Cuayahuitl</p><p>Abstract: Surface realisation decisions in language generation can be sensitive to a language model, but also to decisions of content selection. We therefore propose the joint optimisation of content selection and surface realisation using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). To this end, we suggest a novel reward function that is induced from human data and is especially suited for surface realisation. It is based on a generation space in the form of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Results in terms of task success and human-likeness suggest that our unified approach performs better than greedy or random baselines.</p><p>5 0.90229207 <a title="28-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Neutralizing_Linguistically_Problematic_Annotations_in_Unsupervised_Dependency_Parsing_Evaluation.html">230 acl-2011-Neutralizing Linguistically Problematic Annotations in Unsupervised Dependency Parsing Evaluation</a></p>
<p>Author: Roy Schwartz ; Omri Abend ; Roi Reichart ; Ari Rappoport</p><p>Abstract: Dependency parsing is a central NLP task. In this paper we show that the common evaluation for unsupervised dependency parsing is highly sensitive to problematic annotations. We show that for three leading unsupervised parsers (Klein and Manning, 2004; Cohen and Smith, 2009; Spitkovsky et al., 2010a), a small set of parameters can be found whose modification yields a significant improvement in standard evaluation measures. These parameters correspond to local cases where no linguistic consensus exists as to the proper gold annotation. Therefore, the standard evaluation does not provide a true indication of algorithm quality. We present a new measure, Neutral Edge Direction (NED), and show that it greatly reduces this undesired phenomenon.</p><p>same-paper 6 0.89800495 <a title="28-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-A_Statistical_Tree_Annotator_and_Its_Applications.html">28 acl-2011-A Statistical Tree Annotator and Its Applications</a></p>

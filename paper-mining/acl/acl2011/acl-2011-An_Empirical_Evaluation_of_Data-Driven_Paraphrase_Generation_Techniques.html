We propose an automatic method of extracting paraphrases from definition sentences, which are also automatically acquired from the Web. We observe that a huge number of concepts are defined in Web documents, and that the sentences that define the same concept tend to convey mostly the same information using different expressions and thus contain many paraphrases. We show that a large number of paraphrases can be automatically extracted with high precision by regarding the sentences that define the same concept as parallel corpora.

<p>Author: David Chen ; William Dolan</p><p>Abstract: A lack of standard datasets and evaluation metrics has prevented the field of paraphrasing from making the kind of rapid progress enjoyed by the machine translation community over the last 15 years. We address both problems by presenting a novel data collection framework that produces highly parallel text data relatively inexpensively and on a large scale. The highly parallel nature of this data allows us to use simple n-gram comparisons to measure both the semantic adequacy and lexical dissimilarity of paraphrase candidates. In addition to being simple and efficient to compute, experiments show that these metrics correlate highly with human judgments.</p><p>5 0.36722445 <a title="37-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Using_Bilingual_Parallel_Corpora_for_Cross-Lingual_Textual_Entailment.html">327 acl-2011-Using Bilingual Parallel Corpora for Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment</a></p>
<p>Author: Yashar Mehdad ; Matteo Negri ; Marcello Federico</p><p>Abstract: This paper explores the use of bilingual parallel corpora as a source of lexical knowledge for cross-lingual textual entailment. We claim that, in spite of the inherent difficulties of the task, phrase tables extracted from parallel data allow to capture both lexical relations between single words, and contextual information useful for inference. We experiment with a phrasal matching method in order to: i) build a system portable across languages, and ii) evaluate the contribution of lexical knowledge in isolation, without interaction with other inference mechanisms. Results achieved on an English-Spanish corpus obtained from the RTE3 dataset support our claim, with an overall accuracy above average scores reported by RTE participants on monolingual data. Finally, we show that using parallel corpora to extract paraphrase tables reveals their potential also in the monolingual setting, improving the results achieved with other sources of lexical knowledge.</p><p>6 0.31272927 <a title="37-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Translating_from_Morphologically_Complex_Languages%3A_A_Paraphrase-Based_Approach.html">310 acl-2011-Translating from Morphologically Complex Languages: A Paraphrase-Based Approach</a></p>

<p>Author: Preslav Nakov ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach to translating from a morphologically complex language. Unlike previous research, which has targeted word inflections and concatenations, we focus on the pairwise relationship between morphologically related words, which we treat as potential paraphrases and handle using paraphrasing techniques at the word, phrase, and sentence level. An important advantage of this framework is that it can cope with derivational morphology, which has so far remained largely beyond the capabilities of statistical machine translation systems. Our experiments translating from Malay, whose morphology is mostly derivational, into English show signif- icant improvements over rivaling approaches based on five automatic evaluation measures (for 320,000 sentence pairs; 9.5 million English word tokens).</p><p>6 0.6283803 <a title="37-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Using_Bilingual_Parallel_Corpora_for_Cross-Lingual_Textual_Entailment.html">327 acl-2011-Using Bilingual Parallel Corpora for Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment</a></p>

<p>Author: Aditya Bhargava ; Grzegorz Kondrak</p><p>Abstract: Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P) of names is an important and challenging problem. The correct pronunciation of a name is often reflected in its transliterations, which are expressed within a different phonological inventory. We investigate the problem of using transliterations to correct errors produced by state-of-the-art G2P systems. We present a novel re-ranking approach that incorporates a variety of score and n-gram features, in order to leverage transliterations from multiple languages. Our experiments demonstrate significant accuracy improvements when re-ranking is applied to n-best lists generated by three different G2P programs.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.82035738 <a title="37-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-An_Empirical_Evaluation_of_Data-Driven_Paraphrase_Generation_Techniques.html">37 acl-2011-An Empirical Evaluation of Data-Driven Paraphrase Generation Techniques</a></p>

<p>Author: David McClosky ; Mihai Surdeanu ; Christopher Manning</p><p>Abstract: Nested event structures are a common occurrence in both open domain and domain specific extraction tasks, e.g., a “crime” event can cause a “investigation” event, which can lead to an “arrest” event. However, most current approaches address event extraction with highly local models that extract each event and argument independently. We propose a simple approach for the extraction of such structures by taking the tree of event-argument relations and using it directly as the representation in a reranking dependency parser. This provides a simple framework that captures global properties of both nested and flat event structures. We explore a rich feature space that models both the events to be parsed and context from the original supporting text. Our approach obtains competitive results in the extraction of biomedical events from the BioNLP’09 shared task with a F1 score of 53.5% in development and 48.6% in testing.</p><p>4 0.78157836 <a title="37-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Social_Network_Extraction_from_Texts%3A_A_Thesis_Proposal.html">286 acl-2011-Social Network Extraction from Texts: A Thesis Proposal</a></p>

To date Ihave defined a comprehensive set of social events and built a preliminary system that extracts social events from news articles. Iplan to improve the performance of my current system by incorporating semantic information. Using domain adaptation techniques, Ipropose to apply my system to a wide range of genres. By extracting linguistic constructs relevant to social interactions, I will be able to empirically analyze different kinds of linguistic constructs that people use to express social interactions. Lastly, I will attempt to make convolution kernels more scalable and interpretable.</p><p>5 0.78144735 <a title="37-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-IMASS%3A_An_Intelligent_Microblog_Analysis_and_Summarization_System.html">156 acl-2011-IMASS: An Intelligent Microblog Analysis and Summarization System</a></p>

We introduce a novel two-phase summarization scheme. In the first phase, the post plus its responses are classified into four categories based on the intention, interrogation, sharing, discussion and chat. For each type of post, in the second phase, we exploit different strategies, including opinion analysis, response pair identification, and response relevancy detection, to summarize and highlight critical information to display. This system provides an alternative thinking about machinesummarization: by utilizing AI approaches, computers are capable of constructing deeper and more user-friendly abstraction. 1</p><p>6 0.77668005 <a title="37-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Prototyping_virtual_instructors_from_human-human_corpora.html">252 acl-2011-Prototyping virtual instructors from human-human corpora</a></p>

[sent-2, score-0.73]
</p><p>2 We construct such a model and show that both training on rare events and preferable application to rare events improve perplexity when compared to a simple direct interpolation of class-based with standard language models. [sent-3, score-1.092]
</p><p>3 This is partially due to the additional cost of creating classes Germany and using classes as part of the model. [sent-9, score-0.274]
</p><p>4 But an equally important reason is that most models that integrate class-based information do so by way of a simple interpolation and achieve only a modest improvement in performance. [sent-10, score-0.172]
</p><p>5 In particular, the best probability estimate for frequent events is often the maximum likelihood estimator and this estimator is hard to improve by using other information sources like classes or word similarity. [sent-13, score-0.466]
</p><p>6 We therefore design a model that attempts to focus the effect of class-based generalization on rare events. [sent-14, score-0.248]
</p><p>7 HI models address  the challenge  that frequent  events are best estimated by a method close to maximum likelihood by selecting appropriate values for the interpolation weights. [sent-20, score-0.445]
</p><p>8 In fact, we will use the interpolation weights of a KN model to determine how much weight to give to each component of the interpolation. [sent-25, score-0.169]
</p><p>9 The difference to a KN model is merely that the lower-order distribution is not the lower-order KN distribution (as in KN), but instead an interpolation of the lower-order KN distribution and a class-based distribution. [sent-26, score-0.169]
</p><p>10 We will show that this method of integrating history interpolation and classes significantly increases the performance of a language model. [sent-27, score-0.333]
</p><p>11 Focusing the effect of classes on rare events has another important consequence: if this is the right way of using classes, then they should not be formed based on all events in the training set, but only based  on rare events. [sent-28, score-0.948]
</p><p>12 Finally, we introduce a second discounting method into the model that differs from KN. [sent-30, score-0.202]
</p><p>13 We propose a polynomial discount and show a significant improvement compared to using KN discounting only. [sent-32, score-0.415]
</p><p>14 Section 3 reviews the KN model and introduces two models, the DupontRosenfeld model (a “recursive” model) and a toplevel interpolated model, that integrate the KN model (a history interpolation model) with a class model. [sent-35, score-0.417]
</p><p>15 Based on an analysis of strengths and weaknesses of DupontRosenfeld and top-level interpolated models, we present a new polynomial discounting mechanism that does better than either in Section 6. [sent-38, score-0.393]
</p><p>16 The novelty of our approach is that we integrate phrase-level classes into a KN model. [sent-52, score-0.17]
</p><p>17 Hierarchical clustering (McMahon and Smith, 1996; Zitouni and Zhou, 2007; Zitouni and Zhou, 2008) has the advantage that the size of the class to be used in a specific context is not fixed, but can be chosen at an optimal level of the hierarchy. [sent-53, score-0.198]
</p><p>18 The key novelty of our clustering method is that clusters are formed based on rare events in the training corpus. [sent-55, score-0.65]
</p><p>19 However, the importance of rare events for clustering in language modeling has not been investigated before. [sent-58, score-0.552]
</p><p>20 3  Models  In this section, we introduce the three models that we compare in our experiments: Kneser-Ney model, Dupont-Rosenfeld model, and top-level interpolation model. [sent-64, score-0.172]
</p><p>21 The key idea of the improved model we will adopt is that class generalization ought to play the same role in history-interpolated models as the lowerorder distributions: they should improve estimates for unseen and rare events. [sent-75, score-0.37]
</p><p>22 For a trigram model, this means that we interpolate pKN(w3 |w2) and pB (w3 |w1w2) on the first backoff level and| pKN(w3) and pB (w3 |w2) on the second backoff level, where pB is the (Brown) class model (see Section 4 for details on pB). [sent-77, score-0.288]
</p><p>23 We cluster bigram histories and unigram histories separately and write pB (w3 |w1w2) for the bigram cluster model and pB (w3 |w2) f|owr the unigram cluster model. [sent-82, score-0.827]
</p><p>24 1518  The unigram distribution of the DupontRosenfeld model is set to the unigram distribution of the KN model: pDR(w) = pKN(w). [sent-84, score-0.206]
</p><p>25 Most importantly, it allows a truly parallel backoff whereas in our model the recursive backoff distribution pDR is interpolated with a class distribution pB that is not backed off. [sent-86, score-0.273]
</p><p>26 The strength o|fw history interpolation is that estimates for frequent events are close to ML, e. [sent-90, score-0.491]
</p><p>27 3 Top-level interpolation Class-based models are often combined with other models by interpolation, starting with the work by Brown et al. [sent-96, score-0.211]
</p><p>28 Since we cluster both unigrams and bigrams, we interpolate three models: pTOP(w3|w1w2)  =  µ1(w1w2)pB(w3|w1w2)  +  where  + µ2(w2)pB(w3|w2)  (1 − µ1(w1w2) − µ2(w2))pKN(w3|w1w2) µ1  (w1w2) = λ1 if  w1w2  ∈ B2 and 0 other-  wise, µ2(w2) = λ2 if w2 ∈ B1 an∈d 0B otherwise and λ1 and λ2 are parameters. [sent-98, score-0.245]
</p><p>29 The training set contains 1519 256,873 unique unigrams and 4,494,222 unique bigrams. [sent-102, score-0.212]
</p><p>30 We therefore represent a bigram as a hyphenated word in bigram clustering; e. [sent-113, score-0.186]
</p><p>31 The input to the clustering is the vocabulary Bi andT hthee nclpuustte tro training corpus. [sent-116, score-0.162]

</p><p>33 In this section, we call the WSJ training corpus the raw corpus and the cluster training corpus the cluster corpus to be able to distinguish them. [sent-118, score-0.284]
</p><p>34 The clustUern corpus iesn nthte u sneitg orafm mall c sequences o Tf htweo c unigrams ∈ B1 that occur in the raw corpus, one sequence per line. [sent-134, score-0.15]

</p><p>36 As mentioned above, we need both unigram and bigram clusters because we want to incorporate class-based generalization for histories of lengths 1 and 2. [sent-139, score-0.348]
</p><p>37 Since the focus of this paper is not on clustering algorithms, reformatting the training corpus as described above (as a sequence of hy-  phenated bigrams) is a simple way of using SRILM for bigram clustering. [sent-141, score-0.279]
</p><p>38 The unique-event clusterings are motivated by the fact that in the Dupont-Rosenfeld model, frequent events are handled by discounted ML estimates. [sent-142, score-0.39]
</p><p>39 Consequently, we should form clusters not based on all events in the training corpus, but only on events that are rare because this is the type of event that classes will then be applied to in prediction. [sent-144, score-0.876]
</p><p>40 In practice this means that clustering is mostly influenced by rare events since, on the level of types, most events are rare. [sent-146, score-0.759]
</p><p>41 This is not surprising as the class-based component of the model can only benefit rare events and it is therefore reasonable to estimate this component based on a corpus dominated by rare events. [sent-148, score-0.628]
</p><p>42 We started experimenting with reweighted cor–  pora because class sizes become very lopsided in regular SRILM clustering as the size of the base set increases. [sent-149, score-0.284]
</p><p>43 Highly differentiated classes for frequent words contribute substantially to this objective function whereas putting all rare words in a few large clusters does not hurt the objective much. [sent-151, score-0.407]
</p><p>44 However, our focus is on using clustering for improving prediction for rare events; this means that the objective function is counterproductive when contexts are frequency-weighted as they occur in the corpus. [sent-152, score-0.301]
</p><p>45 After overweighting rare contexts, the objective function is more in sync with what we use clusters for in our model. [sent-153, score-0.226]
</p><p>46 512 unigram classes and 512 bigram classes roughly correspond to this number. [sent-160, score-0.452]
</p><p>47 We prefer powers of 2 to facilitate efficient storage of cluster ids (one such cluster id must be stored for each unigram and each bigram) and therefore choose k = 512. [sent-161, score-0.295]
</p><p>48 To estimate n-gram emission probabilities pE, we first introduce an additional cluster for all unigrams that are not in the base set; emission probabilities are then estimated by maximum likelihood. [sent-163, score-0.318]
</p><p>49 The two class distributions are then defined as follows:  pB(w3|w1w2) = pT(g(w3)|g(w1w2))pE(w3|g(w3)) pB(w3|w2) = pT(g(w3)|g(w2))pE(w3|g(w3)) where g(v) is the class of the uni- or bigram v. [sent-166, score-0.249]

</p><p>58 This again is evidence that rare-event clustering is the correct approach: only clusters derived in rareevent clustering receive high weights αi in the interpolation. [sent-201, score-0.336]
</p><p>59 This effect can also be observed for pTOP: the value of λ1 (the weight of bigrams) is higher for unique-event clustering than for all-event clustering (with the exception of lines 1b&2b). [sent-202, score-0.274]
</p><p>60 The quality of bigram clusters seems to be low in all-event clustering when the base set becomes too large. [sent-203, score-0.345]
</p><p>61 Table 4 compares the two models in two different conditions: (i) b-: using unigram clusters only and (ii) b+: using unigram clusters and bigram clusters. [sent-205, score-0.426]
</p><p>62 However, for unique events, the model that includes bigrams (b+) does better than the model without bigrams (b-). [sent-207, score-0.275]
</p><p>63 The effect is larger for pDR than for pTOP because (for unique events) a larger weight for the unigram model (λ2 = . [sent-208, score-0.222]
</p><p>64 Given that training large class models with SRILM on all events would take several weeks or even months, we restrict our direct 1521  Table4:Usbin-+go. [sent-212, score-0.354]

</p><p>66 ) The improvements in perplexity become smaller for larger base set sizes, but it is reassuring to see that the general trend continues for large base set sizes. [sent-240, score-0.24]
</p><p>67 Our explanation is that the class component is focused on rare events and the items that are being added to the clustering for large base sets are all rare events. [sent-241, score-0.808]
</p><p>68 1  1Dupont and Rosenfeld (1997) found a relatively large improvement of the “global” linear interpolation model – ptop in our terminology – compared to the baseline whereas ptop performs less well in our experiments. [sent-243, score-0.807]
</p><p>69 6  Polynomial discounting  Further comparative analysis of pDR and pTOP revealed that pDR is not uniformly better than pTOP. [sent-245, score-0.166]
</p><p>70 For example, for the history w1w2 = cents a, the continuation w3 = share dominates. [sent-247, score-0.182]
</p><p>71 pDR deals well with this situation because pDR(w3 |w1w2) is the discounted ML estimate, with a disco|wunt that is small relative to the 10,768 occurrences of cents a share in the training set. [sent-248, score-0.192]
</p><p>72 In the pTOP model on the last line in Table 5, the discounted ML estimate is multiplied by 1−. [sent-249, score-0.178]
</p><p>73 Because their training set unigram frequency is at least 10, they have a good chance of being assigned to a class that captures their distributional behavior well and pB (w3 |w1w2) is then likely to be a good estimate. [sent-259, score-0.171]
</p><p>74 For a history with these properties, it is advantageous to further discount the discounted ML estimates by multiplying them with . [sent-260, score-0.272]
</p><p>75 However, it looks like the KN discounts are not large enough for productive histories, at least not in a combined history-length/class model. [sent-265, score-0.157]
</p><p>76 Apparently, when incorporating the strengths of a classbased model into KN, the default discounting mechanism does not reallocate enough probability mass –  –  1522  from high-frequency to low-frequency events. [sent-266, score-0.306]
</p><p>77 The incorporation of the additional polynomial discount into KN is straightforward. [sent-273, score-0.249]
</p><p>78 pPOLKN directly implements the insight that, when using class-based generalization, discounts for counts x ≥ 4 should be larger lthizaant they are oinu nKtsN fo. [sent-277, score-0.153]
</p><p>79 It allows us to determine whether a polynomial discount by itself (without using KN discounts in addition) is sufficient. [sent-279, score-0.38]
</p><p>80 Results for the two models are shown in Table 6 and compared with the two best models from Table 5, for |Bi | = 400,000, classes trained on unique events. [sent-280, score-0.272]
</p><p>81 This shows that using discounts that are larger than KN discounts for large counts is potentially ad-  vantageous. [sent-282, score-0.284]

</p><p>85 We know of no other work that has explored exponents between 0 and 1 and shown that for this type of exponent, one obtains competitive discounts that could be argued to be simpler than more complex discounts like KN discounts. [sent-301, score-0.285]

</p><p>91 (vi) Polynomial discounting is significantly better than KN  discounting for the Dupont-Rosenfeld model pDR although the absolute difference in perplexity is small: 13<∗10. [sent-325, score-0.48]
</p><p>92 The main result of the experiments is that Dupont-Rosenfeld models (which focus on rare events) are better than the standardly used top-level models; and that training classes on unique events is better than training classes on all events. [sent-330, score-0.813]
</p><p>93 (ii) The pDR model (which adjusts the interpolation weight given to classes based on the prevalence of nonfrequent events following) is better than top-level model pTOP (which uses a fixed weight for classes). [sent-337, score-0.571]
</p><p>94 A comparison of Dupont-Rosenfeld and top-level results suggested that the KN discount mechanism does not discount high-frequency events enough. [sent-340, score-0.503]
</p><p>95 We empirically determined that better discounts are obtained by letting the discount grow as a function of the count of the discounted event and implemented this as polynomial discounting, an arguably simpler way of discounting than Kneser-Ney discounting. [sent-341, score-0.67]
</p><p>96 In future work, we would like to find a theoreti-  cal justification for the surprising fact that polynomial discounting does at least as well as Kneser-Ney discounting. [sent-344, score-0.299]

This view entails that the classes in a language model should be learned from rare events only and should be preferably applied to rare events.

<p>Author: Greg Durrett ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the empirical behavior of ngram discounts within and across domains. When a language model is trained and evaluated on two corpora from exactly the same domain, discounts are roughly constant, matching the assumptions of modified Kneser-Ney LMs. However, when training and test corpora diverge, the empirical discount grows essentially as a linear function of the n-gram count.

<p>Author: Denis Filimonov ; Mary Harper</p><p>Abstract: In the face of sparsity, statistical models are often interpolated with lower order (backoff) models, particularly in Language Modeling. In this paper, we argue that there is a relation between the higher order and the backoff model that must be satisfied in order for the interpolation to be effective. We show that in n-gram models, the relation is trivially held, but in models that allow arbitrary clustering of context (such as decision tree models), this relation is generally not satisfied.

<p>Author: Hinrich Schutze</p><p>Abstract: Building on earlier work that integrates different factors in language modeling, we view (i) backing off to a shorter history and (ii) class-based generalization as two complementary mechanisms of using a larger equivalence class for prediction when the default equivalence class is too small for reliable estimation. This view entails that the classes in a language model should be learned from rare events only and should be preferably applied to rare events. We construct such a model and show that both training on rare events and preferable application to rare events improve perplexity when compared to a simple direct interpolation of class-based with standard language models.</p><p>2 0.81369448 <a title="175-lsi-2" href="./acl-2011-An_Empirical_Investigation_of_Discounting_in_Cross-Domain_Language_Models.html">38 acl-2011-An Empirical Investigation of Discounting in Cross-Domain Language Models</a></p>

The method could theoretically be implemented on any other transition-based parser with some adjustments. In this paper, the algorithm is evaluated on CuteForce, an efficient deterministic shiftreduce HPSG parser. The backtracking strategy may serve to improve existing parsers, or to assess if a deterministic parser would benefit from backtracking as a strategy to improve parsing.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.82935464 <a title="175-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Integrating_history-length_interpolation_and_classes_in_language_modeling.html">175 acl-2011-Integrating history-length interpolation and classes in language modeling</a></p>

To enrich the information need representation of a given query, we build a co-occurrence graph to obtain words that augment the original query terms. We then formulate the summarization problem as a Maximum Coverage Problem with Knapsack Constraints based on word pairs rather than single words.

Our experimental results indicate that questions based on the same or similar information need can provide excellent question recommendation. We show that translation model can be effectively utilized to predict the information need given only the user’s query question. Experiments show that the proposed information need prediction approach can improve the performance of question recommendation.</p><p>5 0.76074761 <a title="175-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Algorithm_Selection_and_Model_Adaptation_for_ESL_Correction_Tasks.html">32 acl-2011-Algorithm Selection and Model Adaptation for ESL Correction Tasks</a></p>
<p>Author: Alla Rozovskaya ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of correcting errors made by English as a Second Language (ESL) writers and address two issues that are essential to making progress in ESL error correction - algorithm selection and model adaptation to the first language of the ESL learner. A variety of learning algorithms have been applied to correct ESL mistakes, but often comparisons were made between incomparable data sets. We conduct an extensive, fair comparison of four popular learning methods for the task, reversing conclusions from earlier evaluations. Our results hold for different training sets, genres, and feature sets. A second key issue in ESL error correction is the adaptation of a model to the first language ofthe writer. Errors made by non-native speakers exhibit certain regularities and, as we show, models perform much better when they use knowledge about error patterns of the nonnative writers. We propose a novel way to adapt a learned algorithm to the first language of the writer that is both cheaper to implement and performs better than other adaptation methods.</p><p>6 0.75664097 <a title="175-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-An_Empirical_Investigation_of_Discounting_in_Cross-Domain_Language_Models.html">38 acl-2011-An Empirical Investigation of Discounting in Cross-Domain Language Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Greg Durrett ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the empirical behavior of ngram discounts within and across domains. When a language model is trained and evaluated on two corpora from exactly the same domain, discounts are roughly constant, matching the assumptions of modified Kneser-Ney LMs. However, when training and test corpora diverge, the empirical discount grows essentially as a linear function of the n-gram count. We adapt a Kneser-Ney language model to incorporate such growing discounts, resulting in perplexity improvements over modified Kneser-Ney and Jelinek-Mercer baselines.</p><p>3 0.26305869 <a title="175-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Improved_Modeling_of_Out-Of-Vocabulary_Words_Using_Morphological_Classes.html">163 acl-2011-Improved Modeling of Out-Of-Vocabulary Words Using Morphological Classes</a></p>

<p>Author: Denis Filimonov ; Mary Harper</p><p>Abstract: In the face of sparsity, statistical models are often interpolated with lower order (backoff) models, particularly in Language Modeling. In this paper, we argue that there is a relation between the higher order and the backoff model that must be satisfied in order for the interpolation to be effective. We show that in n-gram models, the relation is trivially held, but in models that allow arbitrary clustering of context (such as decision tree models), this relation is generally not satisfied. Based on this insight, we also propose a generalization of linear interpolation which significantly improves the performance of a decision tree language model.</p><p>5 0.15770455 <a title="175-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-A_Scalable_Probabilistic_Classifier_for_Language_Modeling.html">24 acl-2011-A Scalable Probabilistic Classifier for Language Modeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Joel Lang</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel probabilistic classifier, which scales well to problems that involve a large number ofclasses and require training on large datasets. A prominent example of such a problem is language modeling. Our classifier is based on the assumption that each feature is associated with a predictive strength, which quantifies how well the feature can predict the class by itself. The predictions of individual features can then be combined according to their predictive strength, resulting in a model, whose parameters can be reliably and efficiently estimated. We show that a generative language model based on our classifier consistently matches modified Kneser-Ney smoothing and can outperform it if sufficiently rich features are incorporated.</p><p>6 0.14410804 <a title="175-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Semi-supervised_Relation_Extraction_with_Large-scale_Word_Clustering.html">277 acl-2011-Semi-supervised Relation Extraction with Large-scale Word Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael Auli ; Adam Lopez</p><p>Abstract: We present a systematic comparison and combination of two orthogonal techniques for efficient parsing of Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG). First we consider adaptive supertagging, a widely used approximate search technique that prunes most lexical categories from the parser’s search space using a separate sequence model. Next we consider several variants on A*, a classic exact search technique which to our knowledge has not been applied to more expressive grammar formalisms like CCG. In addition to standard hardware-independent measures of parser effort we also present what we believe is the first evaluation of A* parsing on the more realistic but more stringent metric of CPU time. By itself, A* substantially reduces parser effort as measured by the number of edges considered during parsing, but we show that for CCG this does not always correspond to improvements in CPU time over a CKY baseline. Combining A* with adaptive supertagging decreases CPU time by 15% for our best model.</p><p>2 0.74708277 <a title="175-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-MACAON_An_NLP_Tool_Suite_for_Processing_Word_Lattices.html">215 acl-2011-MACAON An NLP Tool Suite for Processing Word Lattices</a></p>

MACAON has been designed to process both human-produced text and highly ambiguous word-lattices produced by NLP tools. MACAON is made of several native modules for common tasks such as a tokenization, a part-of-speech tagging or syntactic parsing, all communicating with each other through XML files . In addition, exchange protocols with external tools are easily definable. MACAON is a fast, modular and open tool, distributed under GNU Public License.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.72246414 <a title="175-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Integrating_history-length_interpolation_and_classes_in_language_modeling.html">175 acl-2011-Integrating history-length interpolation and classes in language modeling</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael Auli ; Adam Lopez</p><p>Abstract: Via an oracle experiment, we show that the upper bound on accuracy of a CCG parser is significantly lowered when its search space is pruned using a supertagger, though the supertagger also prunes many bad parses. Inspired by this analysis, we design a single model with both supertagging and parsing features, rather than separating them into distinct models chained together in a pipeline. To overcome the resulting increase in complexity, we experiment with both belief propagation and dual decomposition approaches to inference, the first empirical comparison of these algorithms that we are aware of on a structured natural language processing problem. On CCGbank we achieve a labelled dependency F-measure of 88.8% on gold POS tags, and 86.7% on automatic part-of-speeoch tags, the best reported results for this task.</p><p>5 0.71111155 <a title="175-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Reversible_Stochastic_Attribute-Value_Grammars.html">267 acl-2011-Reversible Stochastic Attribute-Value Grammars</a></p>

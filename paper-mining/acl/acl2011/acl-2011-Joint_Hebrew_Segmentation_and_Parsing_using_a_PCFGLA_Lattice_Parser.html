</p><p>2 We show that the methodology is very effective: using a small training set of about 5500 trees, we construct a parser which parses and segments unsegmented Hebrew text with an F-score of almost 80%, an error reduction of over 20% over the best previous result for this task. [sent-6, score-0.393]
</p><p>3 This result indicates that lattice parsing with the Berkeley parser is an effective methodology for parsing over uncertain inputs. [sent-7, score-1.159]
</p><p>4 1 Introduction Most work on parsing assumes that the lexical items in the yield of a parse tree are fully observed, and  correspond to space delimited tokens, perhaps after a deterministic preprocessing step of tokenization. [sent-8, score-0.399]
</p><p>5 For example, the Hebrew token bcl1 can be interpreted as the single noun meaning “onion”, or as a sequence of a preposition and a noun b-cl meaning “in (the) shadow”. [sent-10, score-0.128]
</p><p>6 , 2001) 704 items corresponding to an input string is ambiguous, and cannot be determined using a deterministic procedure. [sent-12, score-0.127]
</p><p>7 In this work, we focus on constituency parsing of Modern Hebrew (henceforth Hebrew) from raw unsegmented text. [sent-13, score-0.367]
</p><p>8 A common method of approaching the discrepancy between input strings and space delimited to-  kens is using a pipeline process, in which the input string is pre-segmented prior to handing it to a parser. [sent-14, score-0.228]
</p><p>9 The shortcoming of this method, as noted by (Tsarfaty, 2006), is that many segmentation decisions cannot be resolved based on local context alone. [sent-15, score-0.183]
</p><p>10 Thus, segmentation decisions should be integrated into the parsing process and not performed as an independent preprocessing step. [sent-17, score-0.401]
</p><p>11 Goldberg and Tsarfaty (2008) demonstrated the effectiveness of lattice parsing for jointly performing segmentation and parsing of Hebrew text. [sent-18, score-1.158]
</p><p>12 They experimented with various manual refinements of unlexicalized, treebank-derived grammars, and showed that better grammars contribute to better segmentation accuracies. [sent-19, score-0.218]
</p><p>13 (2009) showed that segmentation and parsing accuracies can be further improved by extending the lexical coverage of a lattice-parser using an external resource. [sent-21, score-0.495]
</p><p>14 Recently, Green and Manning (2010) demonstrated the effectiveness of lattice-parsing for parsing Arabic. [sent-22, score-0.252]
</p><p>15 Here, we report the results of experiments cou-  pling lattice parsing together with the currently best grammar learning method: the Berkeley PCFG-LA parser (Petrov et al. [sent-23, score-0.929]
</p><p>16 Several such elements may attach together, producing forms such as wfmhfmf (w-f-m-hfmf “and-that-from-the-sun”). [sent-29, score-0.162]
</p><p>17 The linear order of such segmental elements within a token is fixed (disallowing the reading w-f-m-h-f-mf in the previous example). [sent-31, score-0.136]
</p><p>18 However, the syntactic relations of these elements with respect to the rest of the sentence is rather free. [sent-32, score-0.068]
</p><p>19 The relativizer f(“that”) for example may attach to an arbitrarily long relative  clause that goes beyond token boundaries. [sent-33, score-0.179]
</p><p>20 To further complicate matters, the definite article h(“the”) is not realized in writing when following the particles b(“in”),k(“like”) and l(“to”). [sent-34, score-0.098]
</p><p>21 In addition, pronominal elements may attach to nouns, verbs, adverbs, prepositions and others as suffixes (e. [sent-36, score-0.139]
</p><p>22 Rich templatic morphology Hebrew has a very productive morphological structure, which is based on a root+template system. [sent-45, score-0.161]
</p><p>23 The productive morphology results in many distinct word forms and a high out-of-vocabulary rate which makes it hard to reliably estimate lexical parameters from annotated  corpora. [sent-46, score-0.094]
</p><p>24 The root+template system (combined with the unvocalized writing system and rich affixation) makes it hard to guess the morphological analyses 705 of an unknown word based on its prefix and suffix, as usually done in other languages. [sent-47, score-0.288]
</p><p>25 Unvocalized writing system Most vowels are not marked in everyday Hebrew text, which results in a very high level of lexical and morphological ambiguity. [sent-48, score-0.197]
</p><p>26 Agreement Hebrew grammar forces morphological agreement between Adjectives and Nouns (which should agree on Gender and Number and definiteness), and between Subjects and Verbs (which should agree on Gender and Number). [sent-50, score-0.248]
</p><p>27 3  PCFG-LA Grammar Estimation  Klein and Manning (2003) demonstrated that linguistically informed splitting of non-terminal symbols in treebank-derived grammars can result in accurate grammars. [sent-51, score-0.096]
</p><p>28 Their work triggered investiga-  tions in automatic grammar refinement and statesplitting (Matsuzaki et al. [sent-52, score-0.109]
</p><p>29 , 2006) and its publicly available implementation, the Berkeley parser2, works by starting with a bare-bones treebank derived grammar and automatically refining it in split-merge-smooth cycles. [sent-56, score-0.184]
</p><p>30 The learning works by iteratively (1) splitting each non-terminal category in two, (2) merging back non-effective splits and (3) smoothing the split non-terminals toward their shared ancestor. [sent-57, score-0.066]
</p><p>31 This process allows learning tree annotations which capture many latent syntactic interactions. [sent-59, score-0.066]
</p><p>32 At inference time, the latent annotations are (approximately) marginalized out, resulting in the (approximate) most probable unannotated tree according to the refined grammar. [sent-60, score-0.066]
</p><p>33 This parsing methodology is very robust, producing state of the art accuracies for English, as well as many other languages including German (Petrov and Klein, 2008), French (Candito et al. [sent-61, score-0.337]
</p><p>34 The grammar learning process is applied to binarized parse trees, with 1st-order vertical and 0thorder horizontal markovization. [sent-63, score-0.105]

</p><p>36 Lattice arcs correspond  to different segments of the token, each lattice path encodes a possible reading of the sentence. [sent-68, score-0.597]
</p><p>37 Notice how the token bclm have analyses which include segments which are not directly present in the unsegmented form, such as the definite article h (1-3) and the pronominal suffix which is expanded to the sequence fl hm (“of them”, 2-4, 4-5). [sent-69, score-0.512]
</p><p>38 However, it allows the resulting refined grammar to encode its own set ofdependencies between a node and its sisters, as well as ordering preferences in long, flat rules. [sent-72, score-0.1]
</p><p>39 Our initial experiments on Hebrew confirm that moving to higher order horizontal markovization degrades parsing performance, while producing much larger grammars. [sent-73, score-0.291]
</p><p>40 4  Lattice Representation and Parsing  Following (Goldberg and Tsarfaty, 2008) we deal with the ambiguous affixation patterns in Hebrew by encoding the input sentence as a segmentation lattice. [sent-74, score-0.339]
</p><p>41 Each token is encoded as a lattice representing its possible analyses, and the token-lattices are then concatenated to form the sentence-lattice. [sent-75, score-0.6]
</p><p>42 Figure 1 presents the lattice for the two token sentence “bclm hneim”. [sent-76, score-0.6]
</p><p>43 Lattice Parsing The CKY parsing algorithm can be extended to accept a lattice as its input (Chappelier et al. [sent-78, score-0.793]
</p><p>44 This works by indexing lexical items by their start and end states in the lattice instead of by their sentence position, and changing the initialization procedure of CKY to allow terminal and preterminal sybols of spans of sizes > 1. [sent-80, score-0.579]
</p><p>45 It is then relatively straightforward to modify the parsing mechanism to support this change: not giving special treatments for spans of size 1, and distinguishing lexical items from non-terminals by a specified marking instead of by their position in the chart. [sent-81, score-0.349]
</p><p>46 We 706 modified the PCFG-LA Berkeley parser to accept  lattice input at inference time (training is performed as usual on fully observed treebank trees). [sent-82, score-0.783]
</p><p>47 Lattice Construction We construct the token lattices using MILA, a lexicon-based morphological analyzer which provides a set of possible analyses for each token (Itai and Wintner, 2008). [sent-83, score-0.447]
</p><p>48 Still, the use of the lexicon for lattice construction rather than relying on forms seen in the treebank is essential to achieve parsing accuracy. [sent-87, score-0.88]
</p><p>49 Lexical Probabilities Estimation Lexical p(t → w) probabilities are defined over iLndeixviicdaula pl segments rather than for complete tokens. [sent-88, score-0.122]
</p><p>50 We use the default lexical probability estimation of the Berkeley parser. [sent-90, score-0.072]
</p><p>51 (2009) suggest to estimate lexical probabilities for rare and unseen segments using emission probabilities of an HMM tagger trained using EM on large corpora. [sent-92, score-0.189]
</p><p>52 Our preliminary exper-  iments with this method with the Berkeley parser 3Probabilities for robust segments (lexical items observed 100 times or more in training) are based on the MLE estimates resulting from the EM procedure. [sent-93, score-0.262]
</p><p>53 Other segments are assigned smoothed probabilities which combine the p(w|t) MLE estismmaoteo twheithd unigram tag probabilities. [sent-94, score-0.122]
</p><p>54 Crucially, we restrict each segment to appear only with tags which are licensed by a morphological analyzer, as encoded in the lattice. [sent-96, score-0.181]
</p><p>55 When analyzing the parsing results on out-of-treebank text, we observed cases where this estimation method indeed fixed mistakes, and others where it hurt. [sent-99, score-0.253]
</p><p>56 We are still uncertain if the slight drop in performance over the test set is due to overfitting of the treebank vocabulary, or the inadequacy of the method in general. [sent-100, score-0.111]

</p><p>58 Gold Segmentation and Tagging To assess the adequacy of the Berkeley parser for Hebrew, we performed baseline experiments in which either gold segmentation and tagging or just gold segmentation were available to the parser. [sent-108, score-0.683]
</p><p>59 8% for the gold segmentation and tagging, and about 82. [sent-110, score-0.221]
</p><p>60 This shows the adequacy of the PCFG-LA methodology for parsing the Hebrew treebank, but also goes to show the highly ambiguous nature of the tagging. [sent-112, score-0.34]
</p><p>61 Our baseline lattice parsing experiment (without the lexicon) results in an F-score of around 76%. [sent-113, score-0.723]
</p><p>62 4 Segmentation → Parsing pipeline As another baseline, we experimented w piithp a pipeline system in which the input text is automatically segmented and tagged using a state-of-the-art HMM pos-tagger  (Goldberg et al. [sent-114, score-0.264]
</p><p>63 5 In the pipeline setting, we either allow the parser to assign all possible POS-tags, or restrict it to POS-tags licensed by the lexicon. [sent-119, score-0.275]
</p><p>64 Lattice Parsing Experiments Our initial lattice parsing experiments with the Berkeley parser were disappointing. [sent-120, score-0.856]
</p><p>65 The lattice seemed too permissive, allowing the parser to chose weird analyses. [sent-121, score-0.638]
</p><p>66 Error analysis suggested the parser failed to distinguish among the various kinds of VPs: finite, non-finite and modals. [sent-122, score-0.133]
</p><p>67 Once we annotate the treebank verbs into finite, non-finite and modals6, results improve a lot. [sent-123, score-0.075]
</p><p>68 Further improvement was gained by specifically marking the subject-NPs. [sent-124, score-0.057]
</p><p>69 7 The parser was not able to correctly learn these splits on its own, but  once they were manually provided it did a very good job utilizing this information. [sent-125, score-0.172]
</p><p>70 In all the experiments, the use of the morphological analyzer in producing the lattice was crucial for parsing accuracy. [sent-128, score-0.976]
</p><p>71 Results Our final configuration (marking verbal forms and subject-NPs, using the analyzer to construct the lattice and training the parser for 5 iterations) produces remarkable parsing accuracy when parsing from unsegmented text: an F-score of 79. [sent-129, score-1.38]
</p><p>72 The pipeline systems with the same grammar achieve substantially lower F-scores of 75. [sent-134, score-0.164]
</p><p>73 For comparison, the previous best results for parsing Hebrew are 84. [sent-137, score-0.218]

</p><p>77 (2009) also report improvements in accuracy when providing the PCFG-LA parser with few manuallydevised linguistically-motivated state-splits. [sent-145, score-0.133]
</p><p>78 While the pipeline system already improves over the previous best results, the lattice-based joint-model improves results even further. [sent-155, score-0.091]
</p><p>79 Overall, the PCFGLA+Lattice parser improve results by 6 F-points absolute, an error reduction of about 20%. [sent-156, score-0.133]
</p><p>80 Tagging accuracies are also remarkable, and constitute stateof-the-art tagging for Hebrew. [sent-157, score-0.104]
</p><p>81 Running time The lattice representation effectively results in longer inputs to the parser. [sent-159, score-0.531]
</p><p>82 It is informative to quantify the effect of the lattice representation on the parsing time, which is cubic in sentence length. [sent-160, score-0.749]
</p><p>83 The pipeline parser parsed the 483 pre-segmented input sentences in 151 seconds (3. [sent-161, score-0.264]
</p><p>84 2 sentences/second) not including segmentation time, while the lattice parser took 175 seconds (2. [sent-162, score-0.821]
</p><p>85 Parsing with the lattice representation is slower than in the pipeline setup, but not prohibitively so. [sent-164, score-0.622]
</p><p>86 However, the statesplit model exhibits no notion of syntactic agreement on gender and number. [sent-167, score-0.109]
</p><p>87 This is troubling, as we encountered a fair amount of parsing mistakes  which would have been solved if the parser were to use agreement information. [sent-168, score-0.449]
</p><p>88 708 6 Conclusions and Future Work We demonstrated that the combination of lattice parsing with the PCFG-LA Berkeley parser is highly effective. [sent-169, score-0.89]
</p><p>89 Lattice parsing allows much needed flexibility in providing input to a parser when the yield of the tree is not known in advance, and the grammar refinement and estimation techniques of the Berkeley parser provide a strong disambiguation component. [sent-170, score-0.668]
</p><p>90 In this work, we applied the Berkeley+Lattice parser to the challenging task of joint segmentation and parsing of Hebrew text. [sent-171, score-0.534]
</p><p>91 The result is the first constituency parser which can parse naturally occurring unsegmented Hebrew text with an acceptable accuracy (an F1 score of 80%). [sent-172, score-0.282]

<p>Author: John Lee ; Jason Naradowsky ; David A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: Most previous studies of morphological disambiguation and dependency parsing have been pursued independently. Morphological taggers operate on n-grams and do not take into account syntactic relations; parsers use the “pipeline” approach, assuming that morphological information has been separately obtained. However, in morphologically-rich languages, there is often considerable interaction between morphology and syntax, such that neither can be disambiguated without the other. In this paper, we propose a discriminative model that jointly infers morphological properties and syntactic structures. In evaluations on various highly-inflected languages, this joint model outperforms both a baseline tagger in morphological disambiguation, and a pipeline parser in head selection.</p><p>4 0.15959799 <a title="184-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Parsing_the_Internal_Structure_of_Words%3A_A_New_Paradigm_for_Chinese_Word_Segmentation.html">241 acl-2011-Parsing the Internal Structure of Words: A New Paradigm for Chinese Word Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongguo Li</p><p>Abstract: Lots of Chinese characters are very productive in that they can form many structured words either as prefixes or as suffixes. Previous research in Chinese word segmentation mainly focused on identifying only the word boundaries without considering the rich internal structures of many words. In this paper we argue that this is unsatisfying in many ways, both practically and theoretically. Instead, we propose that word structures should be recovered in morphological analysis. An elegant approach for doing this is given and the result is shown to be promising enough for encouraging further effort in this direction. Our probability model is trained with the Penn Chinese Treebank and actually is able to parse both word and phrase structures in a unified way. 1 Why Parse Word Structures? Research in Chinese word segmentation has progressed tremendously in recent years, with state of the art performing at around 97% in precision and recall (Xue, 2003; Gao et al., 2005; Zhang and Clark, 2007; Li and Sun, 2009). However, virtually all these systems focus exclusively on recognizing the word boundaries, giving no consideration to the internal structures of many words. Though it has been the standard practice for many years, we argue that this paradigm is inadequate both in theory and in practice, for at least the following four reasons.

<p>Author: John Lee ; Jason Naradowsky ; David A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: Most previous studies of morphological disambiguation and dependency parsing have been pursued independently. Morphological taggers operate on n-grams and do not take into account syntactic relations; parsers use the “pipeline” approach, assuming that morphological information has been separately obtained. However, in morphologically-rich languages, there is often considerable interaction between morphology and syntax, such that neither can be disambiguated without the other. In this paper, we propose a discriminative model that jointly infers morphological properties and syntactic structures. In evaluations on various highly-inflected languages, this joint model outperforms both a baseline tagger in morphological disambiguation, and a pipeline parser in head selection.</p><p>3 0.75871414 <a title="184-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-Parsing_the_Internal_Structure_of_Words%3A_A_New_Paradigm_for_Chinese_Word_Segmentation.html">241 acl-2011-Parsing the Internal Structure of Words: A New Paradigm for Chinese Word Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongguo Li</p><p>Abstract: Lots of Chinese characters are very productive in that they can form many structured words either as prefixes or as suffixes. Previous research in Chinese word segmentation mainly focused on identifying only the word boundaries without considering the rich internal structures of many words. In this paper we argue that this is unsatisfying in many ways, both practically and theoretically. Instead, we propose that word structures should be recovered in morphological analysis. An elegant approach for doing this is given and the result is shown to be promising enough for encouraging further effort in this direction. Our probability model is trained with the Penn Chinese Treebank and actually is able to parse both word and phrase structures in a unified way. 1 Why Parse Word Structures? Research in Chinese word segmentation has progressed tremendously in recent years, with state of the art performing at around 97% in precision and recall (Xue, 2003; Gao et al., 2005; Zhang and Clark, 2007; Li and Sun, 2009). However, virtually all these systems focus exclusively on recognizing the word boundaries, giving no consideration to the internal structures of many words. Though it has been the standard practice for many years, we argue that this paradigm is inadequate both in theory and in practice, for at least the following four reasons. The first reason is that if we confine our definition of word segmentation to the identification of word boundaries, then people tend to have divergent 1405 opinions as to whether a linguistic unit is a word or not (Sproat et al., 1996). This has led to many different annotation standards for Chinese word segmentation. Even worse, this could cause inconsistency in the same corpus. For instance, 䉂 擌 奒 ‘vice president’ is considered to be one word in the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005), but is split into two words by the Peking University corpus in the SIGHAN Bakeoffs (Sproat and Emerson, 2003). Meanwhile, 䉂 䀓 惼 ‘vice director’ and 䉂 䚲䡮 ‘deputy are both segmented into two words in the same Penn Chinese Treebank. In fact, all these words are composed of the prefix 䉂 ‘vice’ and a root word. Thus the structure of 䉂擌奒 ‘vice president’ can be represented with the tree in Figure 1. Without a doubt, there is complete agree- manager’ NN ,,ll JJf NNf 䉂 擌奒 Figure 1: Example of a word with internal structure. ment on the correctness of this structure among native Chinese speakers. So if instead of annotating only word boundaries, we annotate the structures of every word, then the annotation tends to be more 1 1Here it is necessary to add a note on terminology used in this paper. Since there is no universally accepted definition of the “word” concept in linguistics and especially in Chinese, whenever we use the term “word” we might mean a linguistic unit such as 䉂 擌奒 ‘vice president’ whose structure is shown as the tree in Figure 1, or we might mean a smaller unit such as 擌奒 ‘president’ which is a substructure of that tree.

The second reason is applications have different requirements for granularity of words. Take the personal name 撱 嗤吼 ‘Zhou Shuren’ as an example. It’s considered to be one word in the Penn Chinese Treebank, but is segmented into a surname and a given name in the Peking University corpus. For some applications such as information extraction, the former segmentation is adequate, while for others like machine translation, the later finer-grained output is more preferable. If the analyzer can produce a structure as shown in Figure 4(a), then every application can extract what it needs from this tree. A solution with tree output like this is more elegant than approaches which try to meet the needs of different applications in post-processing (Gao et al., 2004). The third reason is that traditional word segmentation has problems in handling many phenomena in Chinese. For example, the telescopic compound 㦌 撥 怂惆 ‘universities, middle schools and primary schools’ is in fact composed ofthree coordinating elements 㦌惆 ‘university’, 撥 惆 ‘middle school’ and 怂惆 ‘primary school’ . Regarding it as one flat word loses this important information. Another example is separable words like 扩 扙 ‘swim’ . With a linear segmentation, the meaning of ‘swimming’ as in 扩 堑 扙 ‘after swimming’ cannot be properly represented, since 扩扙 ‘swim’ will be segmented into discontinuous units.

We show that addressing this task directly, using probabilistic finite-state methods, produces better results than relying on the local predictions of a current best unsupervised parser, Seginer’s (2007) CCL. These finite-state models are combined in a cascade to produce more general (full-sentence) constituent structures; doing so outperforms CCL by a wide margin in unlabeled PARSEVAL scores for English, German and Chinese. Finally, we address the use of phrasal punctuation as a heuristic indicator of phrasal boundaries, both in our system and in CCL.</p><p>6 0.6215381 <a title="184-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-A_Stacked_Sub-Word_Model_for_Joint_Chinese_Word_Segmentation_and_Part-of-Speech_Tagging.html">27 acl-2011-A Stacked Sub-Word Model for Joint Chinese Word Segmentation and Part-of-Speech Tagging</a></p>

We rank the label candidates using a combination of association measures and lexical features, optionally fed into a supervised ranking model. Our method is shown to perform strongly over four independent sets of topics, significantly better than a benchmark method.</p><p>5 0.82620174 <a title="184-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Discovering_Sociolinguistic_Associations_with_Structured_Sparsity.html">97 acl-2011-Discovering Sociolinguistic Associations with Structured Sparsity</a></p>
<p>Author: Jacob Eisenstein ; Noah A. Smith ; Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to discover robust and interpretable sociolinguistic associations from raw geotagged text data. Using aggregate demographic statistics about the authors’ geographic communities, we solve a multi-output regression problem between demographics and lexical frequencies. By imposing a composite ‘1,∞ regularizer, we obtain structured sparsity, driving entire rows of coefficients to zero. We perform two regression studies. First, we use term frequencies to predict demographic attributes; our method identifies a compact set of words that are strongly associated with author demographics. Next, we conjoin demographic attributes into features, which we use to predict term frequencies. The composite regularizer identifies a small number of features, which correspond to communities of authors united by shared demographic and linguistic properties.</p><p>6 0.77381599 <a title="184-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-A_Stacked_Sub-Word_Model_for_Joint_Chinese_Word_Segmentation_and_Part-of-Speech_Tagging.html">27 acl-2011-A Stacked Sub-Word Model for Joint Chinese Word Segmentation and Part-of-Speech Tagging</a></p>

<p>Author: Tim Van de Cruys ; Marianna Apidianaki</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified model for the automatic induction of word senses from text, and the subsequent disambiguation of particular word instances using the automatically extracted sense inventory. The induction step and the disambiguation step are based on the same principle: words and contexts are mapped to a limited number of topical dimensions in a latent semantic word space. The intuition is that a particular sense is associated with a particular topic, so that different senses can be discriminated through their association with particular topical dimensions; in a similar vein, a particular instance of a word can be disambiguated by determining its most important topical dimensions. The model is evaluated on the SEMEVAL-20 10 word sense induction and disambiguation task, on which it reaches stateof-the-art results.</p><p>3 0.12826264 <a title="334-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Identification_of_Domain-Specific_Senses_in_a_Machine-Readable_Dictionary.html">158 acl-2011-Identification of Domain-Specific Senses in a Machine-Readable Dictionary</a></p>
<p>Author: Fumiyo Fukumoto ; Yoshimi Suzuki</p><p>Abstract: This paper focuses on domain-specific senses and presents a method for assigning category/domain label to each sense of words in a dictionary. The method first identifies each sense of a word in the dictionary to its corresponding category. We used a text classification technique to select appropriate senses for each domain. Then, senses were scored by computing the rank scores. We used Markov Random Walk (MRW) model. The method was tested on English and Japanese resources, WordNet 3.0 and EDR Japanese dictionary. For evaluation of the method, we compared English results with the Subject Field Codes (SFC) resources. We also compared each English and Japanese results to the first sense heuristics in the WSD task. These results suggest that identification of domain-specific senses (IDSS) may actually be of benefit.</p><p>4 0.11660938 <a title="334-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Towards_Tracking_Semantic_Change_by_Visual_Analytics.html">307 acl-2011-Towards Tracking Semantic Change by Visual Analytics</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian Rohrdantz ; Annette Hautli ; Thomas Mayer ; Miriam Butt ; Daniel A.

Previous studies have shown that computational models are capable of clustering and disambiguating senses, a more recent trend investigates whether changes in word meaning can be tracked by automatic methods. The aim of our study is to offer a new instrument for investigating the diachronic development of word senses in a way that allows for a better understanding of the nature of semantic change in general. For this purpose we combine techniques from the field of Visual Analytics with unsupervised methods from Natural Language Processing, allowing for an interactive visual exploration of semantic change.</p><p>5 0.10391158 <a title="334-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Unsupervised_Semantic_Role_Induction_via_Split-Merge_Clustering.html">324 acl-2011-Unsupervised Semantic Role Induction via Split-Merge Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Joel Lang ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we describe an unsupervised method for semantic role induction which holds promise for relieving the data acquisition bottleneck associated with supervised role labelers. We present an algorithm that iteratively splits and merges clusters representing semantic roles, thereby leading from an initial clustering to a final clustering of better quality. The method is simple, surprisingly effective, and allows to integrate linguistic knowledge transparently. By combining role induction with a rule-based component for argument identification we obtain an unsupervised end-to-end semantic role labeling system. Evaluation on the CoNLL 2008 benchmark dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms competitive unsupervised approaches by a wide margin.</p><p>6 0.10076766 <a title="334-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Unsupervised_Decomposition_of_a_Document_into_Authorial_Components.html">319 acl-2011-Unsupervised Decomposition of a Document into Authorial Components</a></p>

<p>Author: Mitesh M. Khapra ; Salil Joshi ; Arindam Chatterjee ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: Recent work on bilingual Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) has shown that a resource deprived language (L1) can benefit from the annotation work done in a resource rich language (L2) via parameter projection. However, this method assumes the presence of sufficient annotated data in one resource rich language which may not always be possible. Instead, we focus on the situation where there are two resource deprived languages, both having a very small amount of seed annotated data and a large amount of untagged data. We then use bilingual bootstrapping, wherein, a model trained using the seed annotated data of L1 is used to annotate the untagged data of L2 and vice versa using parameter projection. The untagged instances of L1 and L2 which get annotated with high confidence are then added to the seed data of the respective languages and the above process is repeated. Our experiments show that such a bilingual bootstrapping algorithm when evaluated on two different domains with small seed sizes using Hindi (L1) and Marathi (L2) as the language pair performs better than monolingual bootstrapping and significantly reduces annotation cost.</p><p>6 0.64327198 <a title="334-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-HITS-based_Seed_Selection_and_Stop_List_Construction_for_Bootstrapping.html">148 acl-2011-HITS-based Seed Selection and Stop List Construction for Bootstrapping</a></p>

Using experiments on synthetic multiparty conversations, we show that most models transfer well from text to dialogue.

<p>Author: Dong Wang ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a pilot study of opinion summarization on conversations. We create a corpus containing extractive and abstractive summaries of speaker’s opinion towards a given topic using 88 telephone conversations. We adopt two methods to perform extractive summarization. The first one is a sentence-ranking method that linearly combines scores measured from different aspects including topic relevance, subjectivity, and sentence importance. The second one is a graph-based method, which incorporates topic and sentiment information, as well as additional information about sentence-to-sentence relations extracted based on dialogue structure. Our evaluation results show that both methods significantly outperform the baseline approach that extracts the longest utterances. In particular, we find that incorporating dialogue structure in the graph-based method contributes to the improved system performance.</p><p>4 0.69173276 <a title="334-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Using_Deep_Morphology_to_Improve_Automatic_Error_Detection_in_Arabic_Handwriting_Recognition.html">329 acl-2011-Using Deep Morphology to Improve Automatic Error Detection in Arabic Handwriting Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Nizar Habash ; Ryan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Arabic handwriting recognition (HR) is a challenging problem due to Arabic’s connected letter forms, consonantal diacritics and rich morphology. In this paper we isolate the task of identification of erroneous words in HR from the task of producing corrections for these words. We consider a variety of linguistic (morphological and syntactic) and non-linguistic features to automatically identify these errors. Our best approach achieves a roughly ∼15% absolute increase in F-score aov reoru ag hsliym ∼pl1e5 b%ut a rbesaoslounteab inlec breaasseeli inne. F -Asc doreetailed error analysis shows that linguistic features, such as lemma (i.e., citation form) models, help improve HR-error detection precisely where we expect them to: semantically incoherent error words.</p><p>5 0.68705052 <a title="334-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Recognizing_Authority_in_Dialogue_with_an_Integer_Linear_Programming_Constrained_Model.html">260 acl-2011-Recognizing Authority in Dialogue with an Integer Linear Programming Constrained Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Elijah Mayfield ; Carolyn Penstein Rose</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel computational formulation of speaker authority in discourse. This notion, which focuses on how speakers position themselves relative to each other in discourse, is first developed into a reliable coding scheme (0.71 agreement between human annotators). We also provide a computational model for automatically annotating text using this coding scheme, using supervised learning enhanced by constraints implemented with Integer Linear Programming. We show that this constrained model’s analyses of speaker authority correlates very strongly with expert human judgments (r2 coefficient of 0.947).</p><p>6 0.60801482 <a title="334-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Joint_Identification_and_Segmentation_of_Domain-Specific_Dialogue_Acts_for_Conversational_Dialogue_Systems.html">185 acl-2011-Joint Identification and Segmentation of Domain-Specific Dialogue Acts for Conversational Dialogue Systems</a></p>

</p><p>2 We present the Relation Guided Bootstrapping (RGB) algorithm, which simultaneously extracts lexicons and open relationships to guide lexicon growth and reduce semantic drift. [sent-7, score-0.419]
</p><p>3 This removes the necessity for manually crafting category and relationship constraints, and manually generating negative categories. [sent-8, score-0.278]
</p><p>4 1 Introduction Many approaches to extracting semantic lexicons extend the unsupervised bootstrapping framework  (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997). [sent-9, score-0.326]
</p><p>5 These use a small set of seed examples from the target lexicon to identify contextual patterns which are then used to extract new lexicon items (Riloff and Jones, 1999). [sent-10, score-0.466]
</p><p>6 Bootstrappers are prone to semantic drift, caused by selection of poor candidate terms or patterns (Curran et al. [sent-11, score-0.365]
</p><p>7 , 2002) and WMEB (McIntosh and Curran, 2008), reduce semantic drift by extracting multiple categories simultaneously in competition. [sent-14, score-0.46]
</p><p>8 The inclusion of manually-crafted negative categories to multi-category bootstrappers achieves the best results, by clarifying the boundaries between categories (Yangarber et al. [sent-15, score-0.549]
</p><p>9 For example, female name s are often bootstrapped with 266 j ame s @ it . [sent-17, score-0.053]
</p><p>10 Unfortunately, negative categories are difficult to design, introducing a substantial amount  of human expertise into an otherwise unsupervised framework. [sent-27, score-0.337]
</p><p>11 McIntosh (2010) made some progress towards automatically learning useful negative categories during bootstrapping. [sent-28, score-0.281]
</p><p>12 In this work we identify an unsupervised source of semantic constraints inspired by the Coupled Pattern Learner (CPL, Carlson et al. [sent-29, score-0.201]
</p><p>13 In CPL, relation bootstrapping is coupled with lexicon bootstrapping in order to control semantic drift in the target relation’s arguments. [sent-31, score-0.968]
</p><p>14 Semantic constraints on categories and relations are manually crafted in CPL. [sent-32, score-0.43]
</p><p>15 For example, a candidate of the relation ISCEOOF will only be extracted if its arguments can be extracted into the ceo and company lexicons and a ceo is constrained to not be a celebrity or pol it ician. [sent-33, score-0.556]
</p><p>16 CPL employs a large number of these manually-crafted constraints to improve precision at the expense of recall (only 18 ISCEOOF instances were extracted). [sent-35, score-0.102]
</p><p>17 In our approach, we exploit open relation bootstrapping to minimise semantic drift, without any manual seeding of relations or pre-defined category lexicon combinations. [sent-36, score-0.971]

</p><p>20 This enables the extraction of interesting and unanticipated relations from text. [sent-43, score-0.268]
</p><p>21 However these patterns are often too broad, resulting in the extraction of tuples that do not represent relations at all. [sent-44, score-0.617]

</p><p>23 2  Relation Guided Bootstrapping  Rather than relying on manually-crafted category and relation constraints, Relation Guided Bootstrapping (RGB) automatically detects, seeds and bootstraps open relations between the target categories. [sent-48, score-0.685]
</p><p>24 We demonstrate that this relation guidance effectively reduces semantic drift, with performance approaching manually-crafted constraints. [sent-53, score-0.399]
</p><p>25 RGB alternates between two phases of WMEB, one for terms and the other for relations, with a one-off relation discovery phase in between. [sent-55, score-0.37]
</p><p>26 Term Extraction The first stage of RGB follows the term extraction process of WMEB. [sent-56, score-0.133]
</p><p>27 Each category is initialised by a set of hand-picked seed terms. [sent-57, score-0.145]
</p><p>28 In each iteration, a category’s terms are used to identify candidate patterns that can match the terms in the text. [sent-58, score-0.399]
</p><p>29 Semantic drift is reduced by forcing the categories to be mutually exclusive (i. [sent-59, score-0.448]
</p><p>30 The remaining patterns are ranked according to reliability and relevance, and the top-n patterns are then added to the pattern set. [sent-62, score-0.381]
</p><p>31 1  The reliability of a pattern for a given category is the number of extracted terms in the category’s lexicon that match the pattern. [sent-63, score-0.356]
</p><p>32 A pattern’s relevance weight is defined as the sum of the χ2 values between the pattern (p) and each of the lexicon terms 1In this work,  n  is set to 5. [sent-64, score-0.226]
</p><p>33 These metrics are symmetrical for boPtht ∈cTandidate terms and pattern. [sent-66, score-0.075]
</p><p>34 In WMEB’s term Pselection phase, a category’s pattern set is used to identify candidate terms. [sent-67, score-0.233]
</p><p>35 Like the candidate patterns, terms matching multiple categories are excluded. [sent-68, score-0.281]
</p><p>36 The remaining terms are ranked and the top-n terms are added to the lexicon. [sent-69, score-0.098]
</p><p>37 , 2010), a relation is instantiated with manually-crafted seed tuples and patterns. [sent-71, score-0.511]
</p><p>38 In RGB, the relations and their seeds are automatically identified in relation discovery. [sent-72, score-0.555]
</p><p>39 Relation discovery is only performed once after the first 20 iterations of term extraction, which ensures the lexicons have adequate coverage to form potential relations. [sent-73, score-0.177]
</p><p>40 Each ordered pair of categories (C1, C2) = R1,2 is checked for open (not pre-defined) relations between C1 and C2. [sent-74, score-0.4]
</p><p>41 This check removes all pairs of terms, tuples (t1, t2) ∈ C1 C2 with freq(t1 , t2) < 5 and a cooccurrence score ×χ 2C(t1, t2) ≤ 0. [sent-75, score-0.245]
</p><p>42 The tuples for R1,2 are then used to find its initial set of relation patterns. [sent-78, score-0.462]
</p><p>43 Each pattern must match more than one tuple and must be mutually exclusive between the relations. [sent-79, score-0.263]
</p><p>44 If fewer than n relation patterns are found for R1,2, it is discarded. [sent-80, score-0.405]

</p><p>46 Using the initial relation patterns, the top-n mutually exclusive seed tuples are identified for the relation R1,2. [sent-83, score-0.899]
</p><p>47 Note that R1,2 can represent multiple relations between C1 and C2, which may not apply to all of the seeds, e. [sent-85, score-0.171]
</p><p>48 We discover two types of relations, inter-category relations where C1 C2, and intra-category relations where C1 = C2. [sent-88, score-0.342]
</p><p>49 =  Relation Extraction The relation extraction phase involves running WMEB over tuples rather than terms. [sent-89, score-0.565]
</p><p>50 R1,2 and R2,3, these are bootstrapped simultaneously, competing with each other for tuples and relation patterns. [sent-92, score-0.515]
</p><p>51 Mutual exclusion constraints between the relations are also forced. [sent-93, score-0.299]
</p><p>52 In each iteration, a relation’s set of tuples is used to identify candidate relation patterns, as for term extraction. [sent-94, score-0.632]
</p><p>53 The top-n non-overlapping patterns are extracted for each relation, and are used to identify the top-n candidate tuples. [sent-95, score-0.267]
</p><p>54 The tuples are scored similarly to the relation patterns, and any tuple identified by multiple relations is excluded. [sent-96, score-0.739]
</p><p>55 For tuple extraction, a relation R1,2 is constrained to only consider candidates where either t1 or t2 has previously been extracted into C1 or C2, respectively. [sent-97, score-0.311]
</p><p>56 To extract a candidate tuple with an unknown term, the term must also be a valid candidate of its associated category. [sent-98, score-0.283]
</p><p>57 That is, the term must match at least one pattern assigned to the category and not  match patterns assigned to another category. [sent-99, score-0.448]
</p><p>58 This type-checking  anchors relations to the cat-  egories they link together, limiting their drift into other relations. [sent-100, score-0.364]
</p><p>59 It also provides guided term growth in the categories they link. [sent-101, score-0.37]
</p><p>60 The growth is “guided” because  the relations  ent subregions example,  define,  semantically  coher-  of the category search spaces. [sent-102, score-0.312]

</p><p>64 The term extraction data is formed from the raw 5-grams (t1, t2, t3, t4, t5), where the set of candidate terms correspond to the middle tokens (t3) and the patterns are formed from the surrounding tokens (t1, t2, t4, t5). [sent-111, score-0.635]
</p><p>65 The relation extraction data is also formed from the 5-grams. [sent-112, score-0.399]
</p><p>66 The candidate tuples correspond to the tokens (t1, t5) and the patterns are  formed from the intervening tokens (t2, t3, t4). [sent-113, score-0.587]
</p><p>67 The second relation dataset (5gm + 4gm), also includes length 2 patterns formed from 4-grams. [sent-114, score-0.487]
</p><p>68 The final relation dataset (5gm + DC) includes dependency chains up to length 5 as the patterns between terms (Greenwood et al. [sent-115, score-0.512]
</p><p>69 These chains are formed using the Stanford dependencies generated by the Rimell and Clark (2009) parser. [sent-117, score-0.14]

</p><p>71 Our evaluation process involved manually judging each extracted term and we calculate the average precision of the top-1000 terms over the 10 target categories. [sent-145, score-0.149]

</p><p>73 For RGB, we compare intra-, inter- and mixed relation types, and use the 5gm format of tuples and relation patterns. [sent-148, score-0.708]

</p><p>82 In intra-RGB the categories are more susceptible to single-category  drift. [sent-181, score-0.195]
</p><p>83 The additional constraints provided by anchoring two categories appear to make inter-RGB less susceptible to drift. [sent-182, score-0.259]
</p><p>84 Many intra-category relations represent listings commonly identified by conjunctions. [sent-183, score-0.212]
</p><p>85 However, these patterns are identified by multiple intra-category relations and are excluded. [sent-184, score-0.371]
</p><p>86 Through manual inspection of inter-RGB’s tuples and patterns, we identified numerous meaningful relations, such as i sExpre s s edI n(prot, ce l l). [sent-185, score-0.257]
</p><p>87 Relations like this helped to reduce semantic drift within the CELL lexicon by up to 23%. [sent-186, score-0.386]

</p><p>89 The 5gm+4gm data, which doubles the number of possible candidate relation patterns, performs similarly to the 5gm representation. [sent-188, score-0.324]
</p><p>90 Adding dependency chains decreased and increased precision depending on whether negative categories were used. [sent-189, score-0.377]
</p><p>91 In Wu and Weld (2010), the performance of an OPENIE system was significantly improved by using patterns formed from dependency parses. [sent-190, score-0.241]
</p><p>92 However in our DC experiments, the earlier bootstrapping iterations were less precise than the simple 5gm+4gm and 5gm representations. [sent-191, score-0.147]
</p><p>93 Since the  chains can be as short as two dependencies, some of these patterns may not be specific enough. [sent-192, score-0.217]
</p><p>94 These results demonstrate that useful open relations can be represented using only n-grams. [sent-193, score-0.246]
</p><p>95 5  Conclusion  In this paper, we have proposed Relation Guided Bootstrapping (RGB), an unsupervised approach to discovering and seeding open relations to constrain semantic lexicon bootstrapping. [sent-194, score-0.51]
</p><p>96 Previous work used manually-crafted lexical and relation constraints to improve relation extraction (Carlson et al. [sent-195, score-0.627]
</p><p>97 We turn this idea on its head, by using open relation extraction to provide constraints for lexicon bootstrapping, and automatically discover the open relations and their seeds from the expanding bootstrapped lexicons. [sent-197, score-0.966]

<p>Author: Harr Chen ; Edward Benson ; Tahira Naseem ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to discovering relations and their instantiations from a collection of documents in a single domain. Our approach learns relation types by exploiting meta-constraints that characterize the general qualities of a good relation in any domain. These constraints state that instances of a single relation should exhibit regularities at multiple levels of linguistic structure, including lexicography, syntax, and document-level context. We capture these regularities via the structure of our probabilistic model as well as a set of declaratively-specified constraints enforced during posterior inference. Across two domains our approach successfully recovers hidden relation structure, comparable to or outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we find that a small , set of constraints is applicable across the domains, and that using domain-specific constraints can further improve performance. 1</p><p>3 0.19256859 <a title="262-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Coreference_for_Learning_to_Extract_Relations%3A_Yes_Virginia%2C_Coreference_Matters.html">86 acl-2011-Coreference for Learning to Extract Relations: Yes Virginia, Coreference Matters</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan Gabbard ; Marjorie Freedman ; Ralph Weischedel</p><p>Abstract: As an alternative to requiring substantial supervised relation training data, many have explored bootstrapping relation extraction from a few seed examples. Most techniques assume that the examples are based on easily spotted anchors, e.g., names or dates. Sentences in a corpus which contain the anchors are then used to induce alternative ways of expressing the relation. We explore whether coreference can improve the learning process. That is, if the algorithm considered examples such as his sister, would accuracy be improved? With coreference, we see on average a 2-fold increase in F-Score. Despite using potentially errorful machine coreference, we see significant increase in recall on all relations. Precision increases in four cases and decreases in six.</p><p>4 0.18119211 <a title="262-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-HITS-based_Seed_Selection_and_Stop_List_Construction_for_Bootstrapping.html">148 acl-2011-HITS-based Seed Selection and Stop List Construction for Bootstrapping</a></p>

In this paper, we propose a graphbased approach to helping editors choose effective seeds and stop list instances, applicable to Pantel and Pennacchiotti’s Espresso bootstrapping algorithm. The idea is to select seeds and create a stop list using the rankings of instances and patterns computed by Kleinberg’s HITS algorithm.

<p>Author: Ryan Gabbard ; Marjorie Freedman ; Ralph Weischedel</p><p>Abstract: As an alternative to requiring substantial supervised relation training data, many have explored bootstrapping relation extraction from a few seed examples. Most techniques assume that the examples are based on easily spotted anchors, e.g., names or dates. Sentences in a corpus which contain the anchors are then used to induce alternative ways of expressing the relation. We explore whether coreference can improve the learning process. That is, if the algorithm considered examples such as his sister, would accuracy be improved? With coreference, we see on average a 2-fold increase in F-Score. Despite using potentially errorful machine coreference, we see significant increase in recall on all relations. Precision increases in four cases and decreases in six.</p><p>3 0.75044441 <a title="262-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-In-domain_Relation_Discovery_with_Meta-constraints_via_Posterior_Regularization.html">170 acl-2011-In-domain Relation Discovery with Meta-constraints via Posterior Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Harr Chen ; Edward Benson ; Tahira Naseem ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to discovering relations and their instantiations from a collection of documents in a single domain. Our approach learns relation types by exploiting meta-constraints that characterize the general qualities of a good relation in any domain. These constraints state that instances of a single relation should exhibit regularities at multiple levels of linguistic structure, including lexicography, syntax, and document-level context. We capture these regularities via the structure of our probabilistic model as well as a set of declaratively-specified constraints enforced during posterior inference. Across two domains our approach successfully recovers hidden relation structure, comparable to or outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we find that a small , set of constraints is applicable across the domains, and that using domain-specific constraints can further improve performance. 1</p><p>4 0.69109207 <a title="262-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-End-to-End_Relation_Extraction_Using_Distant_Supervision_from_External_Semantic_Repositories.html">114 acl-2011-End-to-End Relation Extraction Using Distant Supervision from External Semantic Repositories</a></p>
<p>Author: Truc Vien T. Nguyen ; Alessandro Moschitti</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we extend distant supervision (DS) based on Wikipedia for Relation Extraction (RE) by considering (i) relations defined in external repositories, e.g. YAGO, and (ii) any subset of Wikipedia documents. We show that training data constituted by sentences containing pairs of named entities in target relations is enough to produce reliable supervision. Our experiments with state-of-the-art relation extraction models, trained on the above data, show a meaningful F1 of 74.29% on a manually annotated test set: this highly improves the state-of-art in RE using DS. Additionally, our end-to-end experiments demonstrated that our extractors can be applied to any general text document.</p><p>5 0.6905719 <a title="262-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Semi-supervised_Relation_Extraction_with_Large-scale_Word_Clustering.html">277 acl-2011-Semi-supervised Relation Extraction with Large-scale Word Clustering</a></p>

Our framework is able to express complex interactions between alignment components while remaining computationally efficient, thanks to the power and generality of submodular functions. We show that submodularity naturally arises when modeling word fertility. Experiments on the English-French Hansards alignment task show that our approach achieves lower alignment error rates compared to conventional matching based approaches.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.73318243 <a title="262-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Relation_Guided_Bootstrapping_of_Semantic_Lexicons.html">262 acl-2011-Relation Guided Bootstrapping of Semantic Lexicons</a></p>

<p>Author: Anders Sgaard</p><p>Abstract: We consider a very simple, yet effective, approach to cross language adaptation of dependency parsers. We first remove lexical items from the treebanks and map part-of-speech tags into a common tagset. We then train a language model on tag sequences in otherwise unlabeled target data and rank labeled source data by perplexity per word of tag sequences from less similar to most similar to the target. We then train our target language parser on the most similar data points in the source labeled data. The strategy achieves much better results than a non-adapted baseline and stateof-the-art unsupervised dependency parsing, and results are comparable to more complex projection-based cross language adaptation algorithms.</p><p>4 0.53227568 <a title="262-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Improving_Arabic_Dependency_Parsing_with_Form-based_and_Functional_Morphological_Features.html">164 acl-2011-Improving Arabic Dependency Parsing with Form-based and Functional Morphological Features</a></p>

Using controlled experiments, we find that definiteness, person, number, gender, and the undiacritzed lemma are most helpful for parsing on automatically tagged input. We further contrast the contribution of form-based and functional features, and show that functional gender and number (e.g., “broken plurals”) and the related rationality feature improve over form-based features.

<p>Author: Nathanael Chambers ; Dan Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: Standard algorithms for template-based information extraction (IE) require predefined template schemas, and often labeled data, to learn to extract their slot fillers (e.g., an embassy is the Target of a Bombing template). This paper describes an approach to template-based IE that removes this requirement and performs extraction without knowing the template structure in advance. Our algorithm instead learns the template structure automatically from raw text, inducing template schemas as sets of linked events (e.g., bombings include detonate, set off, and destroy events) associated with semantic roles. We also solve the standard IE task, using the induced syntactic patterns to extract role fillers from specific documents. We evaluate on the MUC-4 terrorism dataset and show that we induce template structure very similar to handcreated gold structure, and we extract role fillers with an F1 score of .40, approaching the performance of algorithms that require full knowledge of the templates.</p><p>6 0.52645785 <a title="262-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Unsupervised_Semantic_Role_Induction_via_Split-Merge_Clustering.html">324 acl-2011-Unsupervised Semantic Role Induction via Split-Merge Clustering</a></p>

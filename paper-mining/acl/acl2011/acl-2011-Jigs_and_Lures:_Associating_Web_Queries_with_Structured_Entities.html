</p><p>7 1 Introduction Commercial search engines use query associations in a variety of ways, including the recommendation of related queries in Bing, ‘something different’ in Google, and ‘also try’ and related concepts in Yahoo. [sent-8, score-1.017]
</p><p>8 Mining techniques to extract such query associations generally fall into four categories: (a) clustering queries by their co-clicked url patterns (Wen et al. [sent-9, score-0.693]
</p><p>9 , 2004); (b) leveraging co-occurrences of sequential queries in web search 83 Ariel Fuxman Microsoft Research Mountain View, CA, USA arie l f@mi cro s o ft . [sent-11, score-0.413]
</p><p>10 com query sessions (Zhang and Nasraoui, 2006; Boldi et  al. [sent-12, score-0.356]
</p><p>11 , 2009); (c) pattern-based extraction over lexicosyntactic structures of individual queries (Pa ¸sca and Durme, 2008; Jain and Pantel, 2009); and (d) distributional similarity techniques over news or web corpora (Agirre et al. [sent-13, score-0.323]
</p><p>12 Or for the query string “ice fishing”, we aim to recommend products in a commercial catalog, such as jigs or lures. [sent-21, score-0.529]
</p><p>13 By knowing the entity identifiers associated with a query (instead of strings), one can greatly improve both the presentation of search results as well as the click-through experience. [sent-23, score-0.537]
</p><p>14 Not only can we present the product name to the web user, but we can also display the image, price, and reviews associated with the entity identifier. [sent-25, score-0.298]
</p><p>15 Once the entity is clicked, instead of issuing a simple web search query, we can now directly show a product page for the exact product; or we can even perform actions directly on the entity, such as buying the entity on Amazon. [sent-26, score-0.517]
</p><p>16 In this paper, we define the association between a query string q and an entity id e as the probability that e is relevant given the query q, P(e|q). [sent-31, score-0.801]
</p><p>17 l r Feolel-vance as the likelihood that a user would click on e given q, events which can be observed in large query-click graphs. [sent-34, score-0.486]
</p><p>18 Due to the extreme sparsity of query click graphs (Baeza-Yates, 2004), we propose several smoothing models that extend the click graph with query synonyms and then use the syn-  onym click probabilities as a background model. [sent-35, score-2.198]
</p><p>19 Queries in session logs are annotated using our association probabilities and recommendations are obtained by modeling sessionlevel query-product co-occurrences in the annotated sessions. [sent-38, score-0.269]
</p><p>20 Finally, we demonstrate that our models affect 9% of general web queries with 94% recommendation precision. [sent-39, score-0.507]
</p><p>21 2  Related Work  We introduce a novel application of significant commercial value: entity recommendations for general Web queries. [sent-40, score-0.281]
</p><p>22 This is different from the vast body of work on query suggestions (Baeza-Yates et al. [sent-41, score-0.318]
</p><p>23 , 2011), because our suggestions are actual entities (as opposed to queries or documents). [sent-45, score-0.353]
</p><p>24 , 2001), including successful commercial systems such as the Amazon product recommendation system (Linden et al. [sent-47, score-0.359]
</p><p>25 , actual movie rentals or product purchases), whereas our recommendation system leverages a different re84 source, namely query sessions. [sent-56, score-0.603]
</p><p>26 , 2007) as a mechanism for associating queries to entities. [sent-58, score-0.31]
</p><p>27 For example, if we type the query “canon eos digital camera” on a commerce search engine such as Bing Shopping or Google Products, we get a listing of digital camera entities that satisfy our query. [sent-59, score-0.62]
</p><p>28 However, vertical search engines are essentially rankers that given a query, return a sorted list of (pointers to) entities that are related to the query. [sent-60, score-0.348]
</p><p>29 Initial proposals were based on learning global smoothing models, where the smoothing of a word would be independent of the document that the word belongs to (Zhai and Lafferty, 2001). [sent-66, score-0.29]
</p><p>30 Intuitively, the smoothing of a word in a document is influenced by the smoothing of the word in similar documents. [sent-71, score-0.29]
</p><p>31 Given a search query q, our task is to compute P(e|q), the probability that an entity e is relevant to q, (feo|rq a)l,l t e ∈ Erob. [sent-77, score-0.573]
</p><p>32 (2004), we model relevance as the click probability of an entity given a query, which we can observe from click logs of vertical search engines, i. [sent-81, score-1.221]
</p><p>33 , domain-specific search engines such as the product search engine at Amazon, the local search engine at Yelp, or the travel search engine at Bing Travel. [sent-83, score-0.73]
</p><p>34 Clicked results in a vertical search engine are edges between queries and entities e in the vertical’s knowledge base. [sent-84, score-0.721]
</p><p>35 General search query click logs, which capture direct user intent signals, have shown significant improvements when used for web search ranking (Agichtein et al. [sent-85, score-1.002]
</p><p>36 Unlike for general search engines, vertical search engines have typically much less traffic resulting in extremely sparse click logs. [sent-87, score-0.736]
</p><p>37 In this section, we define a graph structure for recording click information and we propose several models for estimating P(e|q) using the graph. [sent-88, score-0.534]
</p><p>38 Each edge in Cu and Ce represents the number of clicks observed between query-url pairs and query-entity pairs, respectively. [sent-91, score-0.264]
</p><p>39 Let wu(q, u) be the click weight of the edges in Cu, and we(q, e) be the click weight of the edges in Ce. [sent-92, score-0.982]
</p><p>40 If Ce is very large, then we can model the association probability, P(e|q), as the maximum likelihood teisotinm partoiobnab (MLE) o(ef| observing mclaixckims on e given otohed query q:  Pˆmle(e|q) = Pe0w∈Ee(wq,ee()q,e0)  (3. [sent-93, score-0.318]
</p><p>41 1) 85 Figure 1 illustrates an example query entity graph linking general web queries to entities in a large commercial product catalog. [sent-94, score-1.143]
</p><p>42 Figure 1a illustrates eight queries in Q with their observed clicks (solid lines) with products in E1. [sent-95, score-0.546]
</p><p>43 The sparsity of the graph comes in two forms: a) there are many queries for which an entity is relevant that will never be seen in the click logs (e. [sent-101, score-1.053]
</p><p>44 , “panfish jig” in Figure 1a); and b) the query-click distribution is Zipfian and most observed edges will have very low click counts yielding unreliable statistics. [sent-103, score-0.541]
</p><p>45 In the following subsections, we present a method to expand QEC with unseen queries that are associated with entities in E. [sent-104, score-0.353]
</p><p>46 Then we propose smoothing methods for leveraging a background model over the expanded click graph. [sent-105, score-0.589]
</p><p>47 (2009), we address the sparsity of edges in Ce by inferring new edges through traversing the query-url click subgraph, UC(Q ∪ U, Cu), wgh tihche cqouentrayi-nusr many more edges UthCa(nQ Ce. [sent-109, score-0.718]
</p><p>48 If two queries qi and qj are synonyms or near synonyms2, then we expect their click patterns to be similar. [sent-110, score-0.808]

</p><p>55 Basic  Interpolation: This smoothing model, linearly combines our foreground and background mlinoedaerllsy using a mesod oeulr parameter α:  Pˆintu(e|q),  Pˆintu(e|q)=αPˆmle(e|q)+(1−α)Pˆbsim(e|q)  (3. [sent-163, score-0.262]
</p><p>56 7)  In practice, we bucket the observed click parameter, we(q, e), into eleven buckets: {1-click, 2-clicks, . [sent-167, score-0.497]
</p><p>57 8)  In the following sectionP, we apply these models to the task of extracting product recommendations for general web search queries. [sent-175, score-0.337]
</p><p>58 Many systems extract recommendations by mining temporal query chains from search sessions and clickthrough patterns (Zhang and Nasraoui, 2006). [sent-178, score-0.524]
</p><p>59 Specifically, our universe of entities, E, consists of the entities in a large commercial product catalog, for which we observe query-click-product clicks, Ce, from the vertical search logs. [sent-183, score-0.473]
</p><p>60 Our QEC graph is completed by extracting query-click-urls from a search engine’s general search logs, Cu. [sent-184, score-0.28]
</p><p>61 2 Recommendation Algorithm We hypothesize that if an entity is relevant to a query, then it is relevant to all other queries cooccurring in the same session. [sent-188, score-0.456]
</p><p>62 Step 1 Query Annotation: For each query q in a session s, we annotate it with a set Eq, consisting of every pair {e, Pˆ(e|q)}, where e ∈ E such that there eexveisryts an edge {q, e} ∈ Ce rweit eh probability Nexoistets st ahant Eq ew {ilql , bee} empty for many queries. [sent-190, score-0.457]
</p><p>63 Step 2 Session Analysis: We build a queryentity frequency co-occurrence matrix, A, consisting of n|Q| rows and n|E| columns, where each row corresponds to a query and each column to an entity. [sent-192, score-0.318]
</p><p>64 The final recommendations for a query q are obtained by returning the top-k entities e according to Step 3. [sent-196, score-0.494]
</p><p>65 1 Datasets We instantiate our models from Sections 3 and 4 using search query logs and a large catalog of products from a commercial search engine. [sent-199, score-0.797]
</p><p>66 We form  our QEC graphs by first collecting in Ce aggregate query-click-entity counts observed over two years in a commerce vertical search engine. [sent-200, score-0.335]
</p><p>67 Similarly, Cu is formed by collecting aggregate query-click-url counts observed over six months in a web search engine, where each query must have frequency at least 10. [sent-201, score-0.526]
</p><p>68 , α(10), α(> 10) for Pˆintp, where α(x) is the observed click bucket as described in Section 3. [sent-210, score-0.497]
</p><p>69 MSE measures against each edge type, which makes it sensitive to the long tail of the click graph. [sent-236, score-0.48]
</p><p>70 Conversely, MSEW measures against each edge instance, which makes it a good measure against the head of the click graph. [sent-237, score-0.444]
</p><p>71 , without any graph  expansion nor any smoothing against a background  FiguSME0r. [sent-244, score-0.33]
</p><p>72 Buckets scaled by query instance coverage of all queries with 10 or fewer clicks. [sent-247, score-0.573]
</p><p>73 As expected, for larger observed click counts (>4), all models perform roughly the same, indicating that smoothing is not necessary. [sent-258, score-0.591]
</p><p>74 However, for low click counts, which in our dataset accounts for over 20% of the overall click instances, we see a large reduction in MSE with outperforming Pˆintu, which in turn outperforms Pˆhybr. [sent-259, score-0.792]
</p><p>75 The reason it does worse as the observed click count rises is that head queries tend to result in more distinct urls with high-variance clicks, which in turn makes a uniform model susceptible to more error. [sent-261, score-0.777]
</p><p>76 Figure 3 illustrates that the benefit of the smoothing models is in the tail of the click graph, which supports the larger error reductions seen in MSE in Table 2. [sent-262, score-0.577]
</p><p>77 We created two samples from the TEST dataset: one randomly sampled by taking click  Pˆintp  Pˆintp  weights into account, and the other sampled uniformly at random. [sent-265, score-0.46]
</p><p>78 Bold queries resulted from the expansion algorithm in Section 3. [sent-271, score-0.292]

</p><p>81 , the queries for which there is some recommendation) divided by the total number of queries in the log. [sent-322, score-0.51]
</p><p>82 For our performance metrics, we sampled two sets of queries:  (a) Query Set Sample: uniform random sample of 100 queries from the unique queries in the one-month log; and (b) Que ry Bag Sample: weighted random sample, by query frequency, of 100 queries from the query instances in the onemonth log.

</p><p>84 8% of the unique queries, the fact that it covers many head queries such as walmart and iphone accounts for the large query instance coverage. [sent-348, score-0.573]
</p><p>85 Also since there may be many gen-  eral web queries for which there is no appropriate product in the database, a coverage of 100% is not attainable (nor desirable); in fact the upper bound for the coverage is likely to be much lower. [sent-349, score-0.424]
</p><p>86 First, ambiguity is introduced both by the click model and the graph expansion algorithm of Section 3. [sent-355, score-0.533]
</p><p>87 In many cases, the ambiguity is resolved by user click patterns (i. [sent-357, score-0.436]
</p><p>88 , users disambiguate queries through their browsing behavior), but one such error was seen for the query “shark attack videos” where several Shark-branded vacuum cleaners are recommended. [sent-359, score-0.573]
</p><p>89 This is because of the ambiguous query “shark” that is found in the  ourPˆintp  Pˆintp  Pˆmle. [sent-360, score-0.318]
</p><p>90 Pˆintp  click logs and in query sessions co-occurring with the query “shark attack videos”. [sent-361, score-1.17]
</p><p>91 The second source of errors is caused by systematic user errors commonly found in session logs such as a user accidentally submitting a query while typing. [sent-362, score-0.589]
</p><p>92 An example session is: {“speedo”, “speedometer”} where the intseensdsieodn s iess:s {io“nsp was just tsphee esdecoomnedte query ahnerde th thee unintended first query is associated with products such as Speedo swimsuits. [sent-363, score-0.802]
</p><p>93 This ultimately causes our system to recommend various swimsuits for the query “speedometer”. [sent-364, score-0.318]
</p><p>94 6 Conclusion Learning associations between web queries and entities has many possible applications, including query-entity recommendation, personalization by associating entity vectors to users, and direct advertising. [sent-365, score-0.725]
</p><p>95 Although many techniques have been developed for associating queries to queries or queries to documents, to the best of our knowledge this is the first that aims to associate queries to entities by leveraging click graphs from both general search logs and vertical search logs. [sent-366, score-2.003]
</p><p>96 The sparsity of query entity graphs is addressed by first expanding the graph with query synonyms, and then smoothing query-entity click counts over these unseen queries. [sent-368, score-1.487]
</p><p>97 Our best performing model, which interpolates between a foreground click model and a smoothed background model, significantly reduces testing error when compared against a strong baseline, by 18%. [sent-369, score-0.513]
</p><p>98 We applied our best performing model to the task of query-entity recommendation, by analyzing session co-occurrences between queries and annotated entities. [sent-371, score-0.346]
</p><p>99 Experimental analysis shows that our smoothing techniques improve coverage while keeping precision stable, and overall, that our topperforming model affects 9% of general web queries with 94% precision. [sent-372, score-0.468]

<p>Author: Patrick Pantel ; Ariel Fuxman</p><p>Abstract: We propose methods for estimating the probability that an entity from an entity database is associated with a web search query. Association is modeled using a query entity click graph, blending general query click logs with vertical query click logs. Smoothing techniques are proposed to address the inherent data sparsity in such graphs, including interpolation using a query synonymy model. A large-scale empirical analysis of the smoothing techniques, over a 2-year click graph collected from a commercial search engine, shows significant reductions in modeling error. The association models are then applied to the task of recommending products to web queries, by annotating queries with products from a large catalog and then mining query- product associations through web search session analysis. Experimental analysis shows that our smoothing techniques improve coverage while keeping precision stable, and overall, that our top-performing model affects 9% of general web queries with 94% precision.</p><p>2 0.33885074 <a title="181-tfidf-2" href="./acl-2011-Search_in_the_Lost_Sense_of_%22Query%22%3A_Question_Formulation_in_Web_Search_Queries_and_its_Temporal_Changes.html">271 acl-2011-Search in the Lost Sense of "Query": Question Formulation in Web Search Queries and its Temporal Changes</a></p>
<p>Author: Bo Pang ; Ravi Kumar</p><p>Abstract: Web search is an information-seeking activity. Often times, this amounts to a user seeking answers to a question. However, queries, which encode user’s information need, are typically not expressed as full-length natural language sentences in particular, as questions. Rather, they consist of one or more text fragments. As humans become more searchengine-savvy, do natural-language questions still have a role to play in web search? Through a systematic, large-scale study, we find to our surprise that as time goes by, web users are more likely to use questions to express their search intent. —</p><p>3 0.30000111 <a title="181-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Predicting_Clicks_in_a_Vocabulary_Learning_System.html">248 acl-2011-Predicting Clicks in a Vocabulary Learning System</a></p>
<p>Author: Aaron Michelony</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of predicting which words a student will click in a vocabulary learning system. Often a language learner will find value in the ability to look up the meaning of an unknown word while reading an electronic document by clicking the word. Highlighting words likely to be unknown to a readeris attractive due to drawing his orher attention to it and indicating that information is available. However, this option is usually done manually in vocabulary systems and online encyclopedias such as Wikipedia. Furthurmore, it is never on a per-user basis. This paper presents an automated way of highlighting words likely to be unknown to the specific user. We present related work in search engine ranking, a description of the study used to collect click data, the experiment we performed using the random forest machine learning algorithm and finish with a discussion of future work.</p><p>4 0.29038769 <a title="181-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Joint_Annotation_of_Search_Queries.html">182 acl-2011-Joint Annotation of Search Queries</a></p>

<p>Author: Patrick Pantel ; Ariel Fuxman</p><p>Abstract: We propose methods for estimating the probability that an entity from an entity database is associated with a web search query. Association is modeled using a query entity click graph, blending general query click logs with vertical query click logs. Smoothing techniques are proposed to address the inherent data sparsity in such graphs, including interpolation using a query synonymy model. A large-scale empirical analysis of the smoothing techniques, over a 2-year click graph collected from a commercial search engine, shows significant reductions in modeling error. The association models are then applied to the task of recommending products to web queries, by annotating queries with products from a large catalog and then mining query- product associations through web search session analysis. Experimental analysis shows that our smoothing techniques improve coverage while keeping precision stable, and overall, that our top-performing model affects 9% of general web queries with 94% precision.</p><p>2 0.90927607 <a title="181-lsi-2" href="./acl-2011-Search_in_the_Lost_Sense_of_%22Query%22%3A_Question_Formulation_in_Web_Search_Queries_and_its_Temporal_Changes.html">271 acl-2011-Search in the Lost Sense of "Query": Question Formulation in Web Search Queries and its Temporal Changes</a></p>

<p>Author: Joseph Reisinger ; Marius Pasca</p><p>Abstract: We develop a novel approach to the semantic analysis of short text segments and demonstrate its utility on a large corpus of Web search queries. Extracting meaning from short text segments is difficult as there is little semantic redundancy between terms; hence methods based on shallow semantic analysis may fail to accurately estimate meaning. Furthermore search queries lack explicit syntax often used to determine intent in question answering. In this paper we propose a hybrid model of semantic analysis combining explicit class-label extraction with a latent class PCFG. This class-label correlation (CLC) model admits a robust parallel approximation, allowing it to scale to large amounts of query data. We demonstrate its performance in terms of (1) its predicted label accuracy on polysemous queries and (2) its ability to accurately chunk queries into base constituents.</p><p>6 0.74554902 <a title="181-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Query_Weighting_for_Ranking_Model_Adaptation.html">256 acl-2011-Query Weighting for Ranking Model Adaptation</a></p>

<p>Author: Els Lefever ; Veronique Hoste ; Martine De Cock</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a set of exploratory experiments for a multilingual classificationbased approach to Word Sense Disambiguation. Instead of using a predefined monolingual sense-inventory such as WordNet, we use a language-independent framework where the word senses are derived automatically from word alignments on a parallel corpus. We built five classifiers with English as an input language and translations in the five supported languages (viz. French, Dutch, Italian, Spanish and German) as classification output. The feature vectors incorporate both the more traditional local context features, as well as binary bag-of-words features that are extracted from the aligned translations. Our results show that the ParaSense multilingual WSD system shows very competitive results compared to the best systems that were evaluated on the SemEval-2010 Cross-Lingual Word Sense Disambiguation task for all five target languages.</p><p>3 0.64264333 <a title="181-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Exact_Decoding_of_Syntactic_Translation_Models_through_Lagrangian_Relaxation.html">123 acl-2011-Exact Decoding of Syntactic Translation Models through Lagrangian Relaxation</a></p>

<p>Author: Bo Pang ; Ravi Kumar</p><p>Abstract: Web search is an information-seeking activity. Often times, this amounts to a user seeking answers to a question. However, queries, which encode user’s information need, are typically not expressed as full-length natural language sentences in particular, as questions. Rather, they consist of one or more text fragments. As humans become more searchengine-savvy, do natural-language questions still have a role to play in web search? Through a systematic, large-scale study, we find to our surprise that as time goes by, web users are more likely to use questions to express their search intent. —</p><p>3 0.45811787 <a title="181-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Predicting_Clicks_in_a_Vocabulary_Learning_System.html">248 acl-2011-Predicting Clicks in a Vocabulary Learning System</a></p>
<p>Author: Aaron Michelony</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of predicting which words a student will click in a vocabulary learning system. Often a language learner will find value in the ability to look up the meaning of an unknown word while reading an electronic document by clicking the word. Highlighting words likely to be unknown to a readeris attractive due to drawing his orher attention to it and indicating that information is available. However, this option is usually done manually in vocabulary systems and online encyclopedias such as Wikipedia. Furthurmore, it is never on a per-user basis. This paper presents an automated way of highlighting words likely to be unknown to the specific user. We present related work in search engine ranking, a description of the study used to collect click data, the experiment we performed using the random forest machine learning algorithm and finish with a discussion of future work.</p><p>4 0.38063744 <a title="181-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Joint_Annotation_of_Search_Queries.html">182 acl-2011-Joint Annotation of Search Queries</a></p>

Due to their brevity and idiosyncratic structure, search queries pose a challenge to existing NLP tools. To address this challenge, we propose a probabilistic approach for performing joint query annotation. First, we derive a robust set of unsupervised independent annotations, using queries and pseudo-relevance feedback. Then, we stack additional classifiers on the independent annotations, and exploit the dependencies between them to further improve the accuracy, even with a very limited amount of available training data. We evaluate our method using a range of queries extracted from a web search log. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our approach for both short keyword queries, and verbose natural language queries.</p><p>5 0.35637748 <a title="181-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Query_Weighting_for_Ranking_Model_Adaptation.html">256 acl-2011-Query Weighting for Ranking Model Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Peng Cai ; Wei Gao ; Aoying Zhou ; Kam-Fai Wong</p><p>Abstract: We propose to directly measure the importance of queries in the source domain to the target domain where no rank labels of documents are available, which is referred to as query weighting. Query weighting is a key step in ranking model adaptation. As the learning object of ranking algorithms is divided by query instances, we argue that it’s more reasonable to conduct importance weighting at query level than document level. We present two query weighting schemes. The first compresses the query into a query feature vector, which aggregates all document instances in the same query, and then conducts query weighting based on the query feature vector. This method can efficiently estimate query importance by compressing query data, but the potential risk is information loss resulted from the compression. The second measures the similarity between the source query and each target query, and then combines these fine-grained similarity values for its importance estimation. Adaptation experiments on LETOR3.0 data set demonstrate that query weighting significantly outperforms document instance weighting methods.</p><p>6 0.33961016 <a title="181-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Ranking_Class_Labels_Using_Query_Sessions.html">258 acl-2011-Ranking Class Labels Using Query Sessions</a></p>

<p>Author: Marius Pasca</p><p>Abstract: The role of search queries, as available within query sessions or in isolation from one another, in examined in the context of ranking the class labels (e.g., brazilian cities, business centers, hilly sites) extracted from Web documents for various instances (e.g., rio de janeiro). The co-occurrence of a class label and an instance, in the same query or within the same query session, is used to reinforce the estimated relevance of the class label for the instance. Experiments over evaluation sets of instances associated with Web search queries illustrate the higher quality of the query-based, re-ranked class labels, relative to ranking baselines using documentbased counts.</p><p>5 0.69329983 <a title="181-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Query_Weighting_for_Ranking_Model_Adaptation.html">256 acl-2011-Query Weighting for Ranking Model Adaptation</a></p>

<p>Author: Mohit Bansal ; Chris Quirk ; Robert Moore</p><p>Abstract: We propose a principled and efficient phraseto-phrase alignment model, useful in machine translation as well as other related natural language processing problems. In a hidden semiMarkov model, word-to-phrase and phraseto-word translations are modeled directly by the system. Agreement between two directional models encourages the selection of parsimonious phrasal alignments, avoiding the overfitting commonly encountered in unsupervised training with multi-word units. Expanding the state space to include “gappy phrases” (such as French ne ? pas) makes the alignment space more symmetric; thus, it allows agreement between discontinuous alignments. The resulting system shows substantial improvements in both alignment quality and translation quality over word-based Hidden Markov Models, while maintaining asymptotically equivalent runtime.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.7586962 <a title="181-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Jigs_and_Lures%3A_Associating_Web_Queries_with_Structured_Entities.html">181 acl-2011-Jigs and Lures: Associating Web Queries with Structured Entities</a></p>

<p>Author: Xianpei Han ; Le Sun</p><p>Abstract: Linking entities with knowledge base (entity linking) is a key issue in bridging the textual data with the structural knowledge base. Due to the name variation problem and the name ambiguity problem, the entity linking decisions are critically depending on the heterogenous knowledge of entities. In this paper, we propose a generative probabilistic model, called entitymention model, which can leverage heterogenous entity knowledge (including popularity knowledge, name knowledge and context knowledge) for the entity linking task. In our model, each name mention to be linked is modeled as a sample generated through a three-step generative story, and the entity knowledge is encoded in the distribution of entities in document P(e), the distribution of possible names of a specific entity P(s|e), and the distribution of possible contexts of a specific entity P(c|e). To find the referent entity of a name mention, our method combines the evidences from all the three distributions P(e), P(s|e) and P(c|e). Experimental results show that our method can significantly outperform the traditional methods. 1</p><p>4 0.67401022 <a title="181-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-A_Corpus_of_Scope-disambiguated_English_Text.html">8 acl-2011-A Corpus of Scope-disambiguated English Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Mehdi Manshadi ; James Allen ; Mary Swift</p><p>Abstract: Previous work on quantifier scope annotation focuses on scoping sentences with only two quantified noun phrases (NPs), where the quantifiers are restricted to a predefined list. It also ignores negation, modal/logical operators, and other sentential adverbials. We present a comprehensive scope annotation scheme. We annotate the scope interaction between all scopal terms in the sentence from quantifiers to scopal adverbials, without putting any restriction on the number of scopal terms in a sentence. In addition, all NPs, explicitly quantified or not, with no restriction on the type of quantification, are investigated for possible scope interactions. 1</p><p>5 0.66825157 <a title="181-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Automatically_Predicting_Peer-Review_Helpfulness.html">55 acl-2011-Automatically Predicting Peer-Review Helpfulness</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenting Xiong ; Diane Litman</p><p>Abstract: Identifying peer-review helpfulness is an important task for improving the quality of feedback that students receive from their peers. As a first step towards enhancing existing peerreview systems with new functionality based on helpfulness detection, we examine whether standard product review analysis techniques also apply to our new context of peer reviews. In addition, we investigate the utility of incorporating additional specialized features tailored to peer review. Our preliminary results show that the structural features, review unigrams and meta-data combined are useful in modeling the helpfulness of both peer reviews and product reviews, while peer-review specific auxiliary features can further improve helpfulness prediction.</p><p>6 0.63581663 <a title="181-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-An_Unsupervised_Model_for_Joint_Phrase_Alignment_and_Extraction.html">43 acl-2011-An Unsupervised Model for Joint Phrase Alignment and Extraction</a></p>

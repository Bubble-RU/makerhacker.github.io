<p>Author: Zhongguo Li</p><p>Abstract: Lots of Chinese characters are very productive in that they can form many structured words either as prefixes or as suffixes. Previous research in Chinese word segmentation mainly focused on identifying only the word boundaries without considering the rich internal structures of many words. In this paper we argue that this is unsatisfying in many ways, both practically and theoretically. Instead, we propose that word structures should be recovered in morphological analysis. An elegant approach for doing this is given and the result is shown to be promising enough for encouraging further effort in this direction. Our probability model is trained with the Penn Chinese Treebank and actually is able to parse both word and phrase structures in a unified way. 1 Why Parse Word Structures? Research in Chinese word segmentation has progressed tremendously in recent years, with state of the art performing at around 97% in precision and recall (Xue, 2003; Gao et al., 2005; Zhang and Clark, 2007; Li and Sun, 2009). However, virtually all these systems focus exclusively on recognizing the word boundaries, giving no consideration to the internal structures of many words. Though it has been the standard practice for many years, we argue that this paradigm is inadequate both in theory and in practice, for at least the following four reasons. The first reason is that if we confine our definition of word segmentation to the identification of word boundaries, then people tend to have divergent 1405 opinions as to whether a linguistic unit is a word or not (Sproat et al., 1996). This has led to many different annotation standards for Chinese word segmentation. Even worse, this could cause inconsistency in the same corpus. For instance, 䉂 擌 奒 ‘vice president’ is considered to be one word in the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005), but is split into two words by the Peking University corpus in the SIGHAN Bakeoffs (Sproat and Emerson, 2003). Meanwhile, 䉂 䀓 惼 ‘vice director’ and 䉂 䚲䡮 ‘deputy are both segmented into two words in the same Penn Chinese Treebank. In fact, all these words are composed of the prefix 䉂 ‘vice’ and a root word. Thus the structure of 䉂擌奒 ‘vice president’ can be represented with the tree in Figure 1. Without a doubt, there is complete agree- manager’ NN ,,ll JJf NNf 䉂 擌奒 Figure 1: Example of a word with internal structure. ment on the correctness of this structure among native Chinese speakers. So if instead of annotating only word boundaries, we annotate the structures of every word, then the annotation tends to be more 1 1Here it is necessary to add a note on terminology used in this paper. Since there is no universally accepted definition of the “word” concept in linguistics and especially in Chinese, whenever we use the term “word” we might mean a linguistic unit such as 䉂 擌奒 ‘vice president’ whose structure is shown as the tree in Figure 1, or we might mean a smaller unit such as 擌奒 ‘president’ which is a substructure of that tree.

The second reason is applications have different requirements for granularity of words. Take the personal name 撱 嗤吼 ‘Zhou Shuren’ as an example. It’s considered to be one word in the Penn Chinese Treebank, but is segmented into a surname and a given name in the Peking University corpus. For some applications such as information extraction, the former segmentation is adequate, while for others like machine translation, the later finer-grained output is more preferable. If the analyzer can produce a structure as shown in Figure 4(a), then every application can extract what it needs from this tree. A solution with tree output like this is more elegant than approaches which try to meet the needs of different applications in post-processing (Gao et al., 2004). The third reason is that traditional word segmentation has problems in handling many phenomena in Chinese. For example, the telescopic compound 㦌 撥 怂惆 ‘universities, middle schools and primary schools’ is in fact composed ofthree coordinating elements 㦌惆 ‘university’, 撥 惆 ‘middle school’ and 怂惆 ‘primary school’ . Regarding it as one flat word loses this important information. Another example is separable words like 扩 扙 ‘swim’ . With a linear segmentation, the meaning of ‘swimming’ as in 扩 堑 扙 ‘after swimming’ cannot be properly represented, since 扩扙 ‘swim’ will be segmented into discontinuous units. These language usages lie at the boundary between syntax and morphology, and are not uncommon in Chinese. They can be adequately represented with trees (Figure 2).

The last reason why we should care about word the context will always make it clear what is being referred to with the term “word”. 1406 structures is related to head driven statistical parsers (Collins, 2003). To illustrate this, note that in the Penn Chinese Treebank, the word 戽 䊂䠽 吼 ‘English People’ does not occur at all. Hence constituents headed by such words could cause some difficulty for head driven models in which out-ofvocabulary words need to be treated specially both when they are generated and when they are conditioned upon. But this word is in turn headed by its suffix 吼 ‘people’, and there are 2,233 such words in Penn Chinese Treebank. If we annotate the structure of every compound containing this suffix (e.g. Figure 3), such data sparsity simply goes away.</p><p>4 0.17417319 <a title="59-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Shift-Reduce_CCG_Parsing.html">282 acl-2011-Shift-Reduce CCG Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Yue Zhang ; Stephen Clark</p><p>Abstract: CCGs are directly compatible with binarybranching bottom-up parsing algorithms, in particular CKY and shift-reduce algorithms. While the chart-based approach has been the dominant approach for CCG, the shift-reduce method has been little explored. In this paper, we develop a shift-reduce CCG parser using a discriminative model and beam search, and compare its strengths and weaknesses with the chart-based C&C; parser. We study different errors made by the two parsers, and show that the shift-reduce parser gives competitive accuracies compared to C&C.; Considering our use of a small beam, and given the high ambiguity levels in an automatically-extracted grammar and the amount of information in the CCG lexical categories which form the shift actions, this is a surprising result.</p><p>5 0.16722737 <a title="59-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Improving_Decoding_Generalization_for_Tree-to-String_Translation.html">166 acl-2011-Improving Decoding Generalization for Tree-to-String Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jingbo Zhu ; Tong Xiao</p><p>Abstract: To address the parse error issue for tree-tostring translation, this paper proposes a similarity-based decoding generation (SDG) solution by reconstructing similar source parse trees for decoding at the decoding time instead of taking multiple source parse trees as input for decoding. Experiments on Chinese-English translation demonstrated that our approach can achieve a significant improvement over the standard method, and has little impact on decoding speed in practice. Our approach is very easy to implement, and can be applied to other paradigms such as tree-to-tree models. 1</p><p>6 0.15890306 <a title="59-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Automatic_Detection_and_Correction_of_Errors_in_Dependency_Treebanks.html">48 acl-2011-Automatic Detection and Correction of Errors in Dependency Treebanks</a></p>

<p>Author: Jinho D. Choi ; Martha Palmer</p><p>Abstract: This paper suggests two ways of improving transition-based, non-projective dependency parsing. First, we add a transition to an existing non-projective parsing algorithm, so it can perform either projective or non-projective parsing as needed. Second, we present a bootstrapping technique that narrows down discrepancies between gold-standard and automatic parses used as features. The new addition to the algorithm shows a clear advantage in parsing speed. The bootstrapping technique gives a significant improvement to parsing accuracy, showing near state-of-theart performance with respect to other parsing approaches evaluated on the same data set.</p><p>6 0.75219321 <a title="59-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Joint_Hebrew_Segmentation_and_Parsing_using_a_PCFGLA_Lattice_Parser.html">184 acl-2011-Joint Hebrew Segmentation and Parsing using a PCFGLA Lattice Parser</a></p>

<p>Author: Paula Carvalho ; Luis Sarmento ; Jorge Teixeira ; Mario J. Silva</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the expression of opinions about human entities in user-generated content (UGC). A set of 2,800 online news comments (8,000 sentences) was manually annotated, following a rich annotation scheme designed for this purpose. We conclude that the challenge in performing opinion mining in such type of content is correctly identifying the positive opinions, because (i) they are much less frequent than negative opinions and (ii) they are particularly exposed to verbal irony. We also show that the recognition of human targets poses additional challenges on mining opinions from UGC, since they are frequently mentioned by pronouns, definite descriptions and nicknames. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.83588487 <a title="59-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Better_Automatic_Treebank_Conversion_Using_A_Feature-Based_Approach.html">59 acl-2011-Better Automatic Treebank Conversion Using A Feature-Based Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Muhua Zhu ; Jingbo Zhu ; Minghan Hu</p><p>Abstract: For the task of automatic treebank conversion, this paper presents a feature-based approach which encodes bracketing structures in a treebank into features to guide the conversion of this treebank to a different standard. Experiments on two Chinese treebanks show that our approach improves conversion accuracy by 1.31% over a strong baseline.</p><p>3 0.83413213 <a title="59-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Language-Independent_Parsing_with_Empty_Elements.html">192 acl-2011-Language-Independent Parsing with Empty Elements</a></p>

<p>Author: Aaron Michelony</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of predicting which words a student will click in a vocabulary learning system. Often a language learner will find value in the ability to look up the meaning of an unknown word while reading an electronic document by clicking the word. Highlighting words likely to be unknown to a readeris attractive due to drawing his orher attention to it and indicating that information is available. However, this option is usually done manually in vocabulary systems and online encyclopedias such as Wikipedia. Furthurmore, it is never on a per-user basis. This paper presents an automated way of highlighting words likely to be unknown to the specific user. We present related work in search engine ranking, a description of the study used to collect click data, the experiment we performed using the random forest machine learning algorithm and finish with a discussion of future work.</p><p>5 0.7950027 <a title="59-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Identifying_Noun_Product_Features_that_Imply_Opinions.html">159 acl-2011-Identifying Noun Product Features that Imply Opinions</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Zhang ; Bing Liu</p><p>Abstract: Identifying domain-dependent opinion words is a key problem in opinion mining and has been studied by several researchers. However, existing work has been focused on adjectives and to some extent verbs. Limited work has been done on nouns and noun phrases. In our work, we used the feature-based opinion mining model, and we found that in some domains nouns and noun phrases that indicate product features may also imply opinions. In many such cases, these nouns are not subjective but objective. Their involved sentences are also objective sentences and imply positive or negative opinions. Identifying such nouns and noun phrases and their polarities is very challenging but critical for effective opinion mining in these domains. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been studied in the literature. This paper proposes a method to deal with the problem. Experimental results based on real-life datasets show promising results. 1</p><p>6 0.79083383 <a title="59-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Social_Network_Extraction_from_Texts%3A_A_Thesis_Proposal.html">286 acl-2011-Social Network Extraction from Texts: A Thesis Proposal</a></p>

</p><p>7 1 Introduction The availability of learner corpora is still somewhat limited despite the obvious usefulness of such data in conducting research on natural language processing of learner English in recent years. [sent-11, score-1.249]
</p><p>8 In particular, learner corpora tagged with grammatical errors are rare because of the difficulties inherent in learner corpus creation as will be described in Sect. [sent-12, score-1.624]
</p><p>9 As shown in Table 1, error-tagged learner corpora are very few among existing learner corpora (see Leacock et al. [sent-14, score-1.313]
</p><p>10 (2010) for a more detailed discussion of learner corpora). [sent-15, score-0.57]
</p><p>11 For example, the Cambridge Learner Corpus, which is one of the largest errortagged learner corpora, can only be used by authors and writers working for Cambridge University Press and by members of staff at Cambridge ESOL. [sent-21, score-0.65]
</p><p>12 Error-tagged learner corpora are crucial for developing and evaluating error detection/correction algorithms such as those described in (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010b; Chodorow and Leacock, 2000; Chodorow et al. [sent-22, score-0.784]
</p><p>13 This is one of the most active research areas in natural language processing of learner English. [sent-31, score-0.57]
</p><p>14 Because of the restrictions on their availability, researchers have used their own learner corpora to develop and evaluate error detection/correction methods, which are often not commonly available to other researchers. [sent-32, score-0.784]
</p><p>15 Commonly available errortagged learner corpora are therefore essential to further research in this area. [sent-36, score-0.678]
</p><p>16 For similar reasons, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no such learner corpus that is manually shallow-parsed and which is also publicly available, unlike, say, native-speaker corpora such as the Penn Treebank. [sent-37, score-0.699]
</p><p>17 kers work on learner English as well as on edited text such as newspaper articles? [sent-49, score-0.57]
</p><p>18 Nevertheless, a great number of researchers have used existing POS taggers and chunkers to analyze the writing of learners of English. [sent-53, score-0.531]
</p><p>19 For instance, error detection methods normally use a POS tagger and/or a chunker in the error detection process. [sent-54, score-0.572]
</p><p>20 It is therefore possible that a major cause of false positives and negatives in error detection may be at-  tributed to errors in POS-tagging and chunking. [sent-55, score-0.341]
</p><p>21 In corpus linguistics, researchers (Aarts and Granger, 1998; Granger, 1998; Tono, 2000) use such tools to extract interesting patterns from learner corpora and to reveal learners’ tendencies. [sent-56, score-0.699]
</p><p>22 Given this background, we describe in this paper a manually error-tagged and shallow-parsed learner corpus that we created. [sent-58, score-0.63]
</p><p>23 2, we discuss the difficulties inherent in learner corpus creation. [sent-60, score-0.704]
</p><p>24 3, we describe our method for learner corpus creation, including its data collection method and annotation schemes. [sent-62, score-0.758]
</p><p>25 The learner corpus is called the Konan-JIEM learner corpus (KJ corpus) and is freely available for research 1211 and educational purposes on the web1 . [sent-65, score-1.309]
</p><p>26 Another contribution of this paper is that we take the first step toward answering the question about the performance of existing POS-tagging/chunking techniques on learner data. [sent-66, score-0.605]
</p><p>27 2  Difficulties in Learner Corpus Creation  In addition to the common difficulties in creating any corpus, learner corpus creation has its own difficulties. [sent-69, score-0.764]
</p><p>28 As in the case of other corpora, it is preferable that the size of a learner corpus be as large as possible where the size can be measured in several ways including the total number of texts, words, sentences, writers, topics, and texts per writer. [sent-76, score-0.719]
</p><p>29 However, it is much more difficult to create a large learner corpus than to create a  1http : / /www . [sent-77, score-0.63]
</p><p>30 By contrast, in the case of learner corpora, we must find learners and then let them write since there are no such published texts written by learners of English (unless they are part of a learner corpus). [sent-83, score-1.91]
</p><p>31 Here, it should be emphasized that learners often do not spontaneously write but are typically obliged to write, for example, in class, or during an exam. [sent-84, score-0.355]
</p><p>32 Because of this, learners may soon become tired of writing. [sent-85, score-0.324]
</p><p>33 This in itself can affect learner corpus creation much more than one would expect especially when creating a longitudinal learner corpus. [sent-86, score-1.26]
</p><p>34 Thus, it is crucial to keep learners motivated and focused on the writing assignments. [sent-87, score-0.399]
</p><p>35 The second difficulty arises when the collected texts are transformed into a learner corpus. [sent-88, score-0.702]
</p><p>36 The texts must be archived in electronic form, which requires typing every single collected text since learners normally write on paper. [sent-90, score-0.537]
</p><p>37 Optionally, a learner corpus could include other pieces of information such as proficiency, first language, and age. [sent-92, score-0.63]
</p><p>38 The copyright for each text must be transferred to the corpus creator so that the learner corpus can be made available to the public. [sent-97, score-0.802]
</p><p>39 Consider the case when a number of learners participate in a learner corpus creation project and everyone has to sign a copyright transfer form. [sent-98, score-1.177]
</p><p>40 This is often the case since the writers in  learner corpus creation projects are normally junior 1212 high school, high school, or college students. [sent-102, score-0.805]
</p><p>41 For error annotation, several annotation schemes exist (for example, the NICT JLE scheme (Izumi et al. [sent-104, score-0.382]
</p><p>42 While designing an annotation scheme is one issue, annotating errors is yet another. [sent-106, score-0.321]
</p><p>43 Another issue we have to remember is that there is a trade-off between the granularity of an annotation scheme and the level of the difficulty in error annotation. [sent-109, score-0.387]
</p><p>44 The more detailed an annotation scheme is, the more information it can contain and the more difficult identifying errors is, and vice versa. [sent-110, score-0.321]
</p><p>45 For POS/parsing annotation, there are also a number of annotation schemes including the Brown tag set, the Claws tag set, and the Penn Treebank tag set. [sent-111, score-0.499]
</p><p>46 However, none of them are designed to be used for learner corpora. [sent-112, score-0.57]
</p><p>47 In other words, a variety of linguistic phenomena occur in learner corpora which  the existing annotation schemes do not cover. [sent-113, score-0.84]
</p><p>48 For instance, spelling errors often appear in texts written by learners of English as in sard year, which should be third year. [sent-114, score-0.537]
</p><p>49 To handle these and other phenomena which are peculiar to learner corpora, we need to develop a novel annotation scheme. [sent-125, score-0.698]
</p><p>50 In the writing exercises, learners write essays on a blog system. [sent-129, score-0.684]
</p><p>51 Ten learners participated in the preexperiments and were assigned five essay topics on average. [sent-134, score-0.347]
</p><p>52 In the first step, learners are assigned an essay topic. [sent-136, score-0.347]
</p><p>53 , 2006) in the blog system as a trial attempt to keep the learners motivated since learners are likely to become tired of doing the same exercise repeatedly. [sent-143, score-0.755]
</p><p>54 To reduce this, the blog system highlights where article errors exist after the essay has been submitted. [sent-144, score-0.341]
</p><p>55 The hope is that this might prompt the learners to write more accurately and to continue the exercises. [sent-145, score-0.355]
</p><p>56 In the pre-experiments, the detection did indeed seem to interest the learners and to provide them with additional motivation. [sent-146, score-0.359]
</p><p>57 Considering these results, we decided to include the fourth and fifth steps in the writing exercises when we created our learner corpus. [sent-147, score-0.762]
</p><p>58 We considered having it signed on the blog system, but it soon turned out that this did not work since participating learners may still be too young to have the legal right to sign the transfer. [sent-157, score-0.464]
</p><p>59 1 Error Annotation We based our error annotation scheme on that used in the NICT JLE corpus (Izumi et al. [sent-166, score-0.404]
</p><p>60 In that annotation scheme and accordingly in ours, errors are tagged using an XML syntax; an error is annotated by tagging a word or phrase that contains it. [sent-169, score-0.466]
</p><p>61 It should be emphasized that the error tags contain the information on correction together with error annotation. [sent-175, score-0.322]
</p><p>62 plied the NICT JLE annotation scheme to a learner corpus to reveal what modifications we needed to make. [sent-185, score-0.879]
</p><p>63 The learner corpus consisted of 455 essays (39,716 words) written by junior high and high school students3. [sent-186, score-0.818]
</p><p>64 However, since such errors are not usually regarded as grammatical errors, we decided simply not to annotate them in our annotation schemes. [sent-191, score-0.349]
</p><p>65 Fragments that do not form a complete sentence often appear in the writing of learners (e. [sent-193, score-0.399]
</p><p>66 For instance, there are only three tags for errors in nouns (number, lexis, and other) in our tag set whereas there are six in the NICT JLE corpus (inflection, number, case, countability, complement, and lexis); the other tag (n o) covers the four removed tags. [sent-212, score-0.468]
</p><p>67 2 POS/Chunking Annotation We selected the Penn Treebank tag set, which is one of the most widely used tag sets, for our 3The learner corpus had been created before this reported work started. [sent-215, score-0.852]
</p><p>68 Unfortunately, this learner corpus cannot be made available to the public since the copyrights were not transferred to us. [sent-217, score-0.63]
</p><p>69 Similar to the error annotation scheme, we conducted a pilot study to determine what modifications we needed to make to the Penn Treebank scheme. [sent-219, score-0.39]
</p><p>70 In the pilot study, we used the same learner corpus as in the pilot study for the error annotation scheme. [sent-220, score-1.037]
</p><p>71 As a result of the pilot study, we found that the Penn Treebank tag set sufficed in most cases except for errors which learners made. [sent-221, score-0.585]
</p><p>72 Additionally, we define the CE4 tag to annotate errors in which learners use a word with a POS which is not allowed such as in I don’t success cooking. [sent-239, score-0.518]
</p><p>73 Note that the CE tag is compatible with the basic annotation scheme because we can retrieve the basic annotation by extracting only the second element (i. [sent-245, score-0.438]
</p><p>74 If the tag is unknown because of grammatical errors or other phenomena, UK and XP5 are used for POS and chunking, respectively. [sent-248, score-0.332]
</p><p>75 4  The Corpus  We carried out a learner corpus creation project using the described method. [sent-252, score-0.69]
</p><p>76 It turned out that the learners had no difficulties in using the blog system and seemed to focus on writing. [sent-262, score-0.466]
</p><p>77 After the annotation, another person checked the annotation results; differences in error annotaNumber of essays233 Number of writers 25 Number of sentences 3,199 Number of words 25,537 Table 3: Statistics on the learner corpus. [sent-266, score-0.884]
</p><p>78 The error annotation scheme was found to work well on  them. [sent-269, score-0.344]
</p><p>79 1 POS Tagging The 170 essays in the shallow-parsed corpus was used for evaluating existing POS-tagging techniques on texts written by learners. [sent-274, score-0.333]
</p><p>80 The third column corresponds to accuracies on the learner corpus. [sent-288, score-0.57]
</p><p>81 Interestingly, the HMM-based POS tagger performed better on the learner corpus. [sent-290, score-0.616]
</p><p>82 was trained on a corpus consisting of English learning materials whose distribution of vocabulary was  expected to be relatively similar to that of the learner corpus. [sent-294, score-0.63]
</p><p>83 An obvious cause of mistakes in both taggers is that they inevitably make errors in the POSs that are not defined in the Penn Treebank tag set, that is, UK and CE. [sent-298, score-0.33]
</p><p>84 A closer look at the tagging results revealed that phenomena which were common to the writing of learners were major causes of other mistakes. [sent-299, score-0.399]
</p><p>85 Therefore, the taggers tended to identify their POSs according to the surface information on the tokens themselves when such phrases appeared in the learner corpus (e. [sent-310, score-0.761]
</p><p>86 An example is the error detection method (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000), which identifies unnatural sequences of POSs as grammatical errors in the writing of learners. [sent-322, score-0.554]
</p><p>87 as we have just seen, and in turn the error detection method cannot identify it as an error because the sequence PRP VBD is not unnatural; it would correctly detect it if the sentence were correctly tagged as I/PRP frightened/JJ . [sent-327, score-0.364]
</p><p>88 Designing the templates of the transformation for learner corpora may achieve further improvement. [sent-348, score-0.639]
</p><p>89 A possible reason for this is that sentences written by learners of English tend to be shorter and simpler in terms of their structure. [sent-360, score-0.326]

The method involves parsing a reference corpus and inferring grammar patterns in the form of a sequence of content words, function words, and parts-of-speech (e.g., “play ~ role in Ving” and “look forward to Ving”). At runtime, the given passage submitted by the learner is matched using an extended Levenshtein algorithm against the set of pattern rules in order to detect errors and provide suggestions. We present a prototype implementation of the proposed method, EdIt, that can handle a broad range of errors.

<p>Author: Y. Albert Park ; Roger Levy</p><p>Abstract: Automated grammar correction techniques have seen improvement over the years, but there is still much room for increased performance. Current correction techniques mainly focus on identifying and correcting a specific type of error, such as verb form misuse or preposition misuse, which restricts the corrections to a limited scope. We introduce a novel technique, based on a noisy channel model, which can utilize the whole sentence context to determine proper corrections. We show how to use the EM algorithm to learn the parameters of the noise model, using only a data set of erroneous sentences, given the proper language model. This frees us from the burden of acquiring a large corpora of corrected sentences. We also present a cheap and efficient way to provide automated evaluation re- sults for grammar corrections by using BLEU and METEOR, in contrast to the commonly used manual evaluations.</p><p>5 0.15014422 <a title="88-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-They_Can_Help%3A_Using_Crowdsourcing_to_Improve_the_Evaluation_of_Grammatical_Error_Detection_Systems.html">302 acl-2011-They Can Help: Using Crowdsourcing to Improve the Evaluation of Grammatical Error Detection Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Nitin Madnani ; Martin Chodorow ; Joel Tetreault ; Alla Rozovskaya</p><p>Abstract: Despite the rising interest in developing grammatical error detection systems for non-native speakers of English, progress in the field has been hampered by a lack of informative metrics and an inability to directly compare the performance of systems developed by different researchers. In this paper we address these problems by presenting two evaluation methodologies, both based on a novel use of crowdsourcing. 1 Motivation and Contributions One of the fastest growing areas in need of NLP tools is the field of grammatical error detection for learners of English as a Second Language (ESL). According to Guo and Beckett (2007), “over a billion people speak English as their second or for- eign language.” This high demand has resulted in many NLP research papers on the topic, a Synthesis Series book (Leacock et al., 2010) and a recurring workshop (Tetreault et al., 2010a), all in the last five years. In this year’s ACL conference, there are four long papers devoted to this topic. Despite the growing interest, two major factors encumber the growth of this subfield. First, the lack of consistent and appropriate score reporting is an issue. Most work reports results in the form of precision and recall as measured against the judgment of a single human rater. This is problematic because most usage errors (such as those in article and preposition usage) are a matter of degree rather than simple rule violations such as number agreement. As a consequence, it is common for two native speakers 508 to have different judgments of usage. Therefore, an appropriate evaluation should take this into account by not only enlisting multiple human judges but also aggregating these judgments in a graded manner. Second, systems are hardly ever compared to each other. In fact, to our knowledge, no two systems developed by different groups have been compared directly within the field primarily because there is no common corpus or shared task—both commonly found in other NLP areas such as machine translation.1 For example, Tetreault and Chodorow (2008), Gamon et al. (2008) and Felice and Pulman (2008) developed preposition error detection systems, but evaluated on three different corpora using different evaluation measures. The goal of this paper is to address the above issues by using crowdsourcing, which has been proven effective for collecting multiple, reliable judgments in other NLP tasks: machine translation (Callison-Burch, 2009; Zaidan and CallisonBurch, 2010), speech recognition (Evanini et al., 2010; Novotney and Callison-Burch, 2010), automated paraphrase generation (Madnani, 2010), anaphora resolution (Chamberlain et al., 2009), word sense disambiguation (Akkaya et al., 2010), lexicon construction for less commonly taught languages (Irvine and Klementiev, 2010), fact mining (Wang and Callison-Burch, 2010) and named entity recognition (Finin et al., 2010) among several others. In particular, we make a significant contribution to the field by showing how to leverage crowdsourc1There has been a recent proposal for a related shared task (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2010) that shows promise.

Our solution is general enough for, in the simplest case, intrinsically evaluating a single system on a single dataset and, more realistically, comparing two different systems (from same or different groups). 2 A Case Study: Extraneous Prepositions We consider the problem of detecting an extraneous preposition error, i.e., incorrectly using a preposition where none is licensed. In the sentence “They came to outside”, the preposition to is an extraneous error whereas in the sentence “They arrived to the town” the preposition to is a confusion error (cf. arrived in the town). Most work on automated correction of preposition errors, with the exception of Gamon (2010), addresses preposition confusion errors e.g., (Felice and Pulman, 2008; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010b). One reason is that in addition to the standard context-based features used to detect confusion errors, identifying extraneous prepositions also requires actual knowledge of when a preposition can and cannot be used. Despite this lack of attention, extraneous prepositions account for a significant proportion—as much as 18% in essays by advanced English learners (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010a)—of all preposition usage errors. 2.1 Data and Systems For the experiments in this paper, we chose a proprietary corpus of about 500,000 essays written by ESL students for Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL?R). Despite being common ESL errors, preposition errors are still infrequent overall, with over 90% of prepositions being used correctly (Leacock et al., 2010; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010a). Given this fact about error sparsity, we needed an efficient method to extract a good number of error instances (for statistical reliability) from the large essay corpus. We found all trigrams in our essays containing prepositions as the middle word (e.g., marry with her) and then looked up the counts of each tri- gram and the corresponding bigram with the preposition removed (marry her) in the Google Web1T 5-gram Corpus. If the trigram was unattested or had a count much lower than expected based on the bi509 gram count, then we manually inspected the trigram to see whether it was actually an error. If it was, we extracted a sentence from the large essay corpus containing this erroneous trigram. Once we had extracted 500 sentences containing extraneous preposition error instances, we added 500 sentences containing correct instances of preposition usage. This yielded a corpus of 1000 sentences with a 50% error rate. These sentences, with the target preposition highlighted, were presented to 3 expert annotators who are native English speakers. They were asked to annotate the preposition usage instance as one of the following: extraneous (Error), not extraneous (OK) or too hard to decide (Unknown); the last category was needed for cases where the context was too messy to make a decision about the highlighted preposition. On average, the three experts had an agreement of 0.87 and a kappa of 0.75. For subse- quent analysis, we only use the classes Error and OK since Unknown was used extremely rarely and never by all 3 experts for the same sentence. We used two different error detection systems to illustrate our evaluation methodology:2 • • 3 LM: A 4-gram language model trained on tLhMe Google Wme lba1nTg 5-gram Corpus dw oithn SRILM (Stolcke, 2002).

Crowdsourcing Recently,we showed that Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) is a cheap and effective alternative to expert raters for annotating preposition errors (Tetreault et al., 2010b). In other current work, we have extended this pilot study to show that CrowdFlower, a crowdsourcing service that allows for stronger quality con- × trol on untrained human raters (henceforth, Turkers), is more reliable than AMT on three different error detection tasks (article errors, confused prepositions 2Any conclusions drawn in this paper pertain only to these specific instantiations of the two systems. & extraneous prepositions). To impose such quality control, one has to provide “gold” instances, i.e., examples with known correct judgments that are then used to root out any Turkers with low performance on these instances. For all three tasks, we obtained 20 Turkers’ judgments via CrowdFlower for each instance and found that, on average, only 3 Turkers were required to match the experts. More specifically, for the extraneous preposition error task, we used 75 sentences as gold and obtained judgments for the remaining 923 non-gold sentences.3 We found that if we used 3 Turker judgments in a majority vote, the agreement with any one of the three expert raters is, on average, 0.87 with a kappa of 0.76. This is on par with the inter-expert agreement and kappa found earlier (0.87 and 0.75 respectively). The extraneous preposition annotation cost only $325 (923 judgments 20 Turkers) and was com- pleted 9in2 a single day. T 2h0e only rres)st arnicdtio wna on tmheTurkers was that they be physically located in the USA. For the analysis in subsequent sections, we use these 923 sentences and the respective 20 judgments obtained via CrowdFlower. The 3 expert judgments are not used any further in this analysis. 4 Revamping System Evaluation In this section, we provide details on how crowdsourcing can help revamp the evaluation of error detection systems: (a) by providing more informative measures for the intrinsic evaluation of a single system (§ 4. 1), and (b) by easily enabling system comparison (§ 4.2). 4.1 Crowd-informed Evaluation Measures When evaluating the performance of grammatical error detection systems against human judgments, the judgments for each instance are generally reduced to the single most frequent category: Error or OK. This reduction is not an accurate reflection of a complex phenomenon. It discards valuable information about the acceptability of usage because it treats all “bad” uses as equal (and all good ones as equal), when they are not. Arguably, it would be fairer to use a continuous scale, such as the proportion of raters who judge an instance as correct or 3We found 2 duplicate sentences and removed them. 510 incorrect. For example, if 90% of raters agree on a rating of Error for an instance of preposition usage, then that is stronger evidence that the usage is an error than if 56% of Turkers classified it as Error and 44% classified it as OK (the sentence “In addition classmates play with some game and enjoy” is an example). The regular measures of precision and recall would be fairer if they reflected this reality. Besides fairness, another reason to use a continuous scale is that of stability, particularly with a small number of instances in the evaluation set (quite common in the field). By relying on majority judgments, precision and recall measures tend to be unstable (see below). We modify the measures of precision and recall to incorporate distributions of correctness, obtained via crowdsourcing, in order to make them fairer and more stable indicators of system performance. Given an error detection system that classifies a sentence containing a specific preposition as Error (class 1) if the preposition is extraneous and OK (class 0) otherwise, we propose the following weighted versions of hits (Hw), misses (Mw) and false positives (FPw): XN Hw = X(csiys ∗ picrowd) (1) Xi XN Mw = X((1 − csiys) ∗ picrowd) (2) Xi XN FPw = X(csiys ∗ (1 − picrowd)) (3) Xi In the above equations, N is the total number of instances, csiys is the class (1 or 0) , and picrowd indicates the proportion of the crowd that classified instance i as Error. Note that if we were to revert to the majority crowd judgment as the sole judgment for each instance, instead of proportions, picrowd would always be either 1 or 0 and the above formulae would simply compute the normal hits, misses and false positives. Given these definitions, weighted precision can be defined as Precisionw = Hw/(Hw Hw/(Hw + FPw) and weighted + Mw). recall as Recallw = agreement Figure 1: Histogram of Turker agreements for all 923 instances on whether a preposition is extraneous. UWnwei gihg tede Pr0 e.c9 i5s0i70onR0 .e3 c78al14l Table 1: Comparing commonly used (unweighted) and proposed (weighted) precision/recall measures for LM. To illustrate the utility of these weighted measures, we evaluated the LM and PERC systems on the dataset containing 923 preposition instances, against all 20 Turker judgments. Figure 1 shows a histogram of the Turker agreement for the majority rating over the set. Table 1 shows both the unweighted (discrete majority judgment) and weighted (continuous Turker proportion) versions of precision and recall for this system. The numbers clearly show that in the unweighted case, the performance of the system is overestimated simply because the system is getting as much credit for each contentious case (low agreement) as for each clear one (high agreement). In the weighted measure we propose, the contentious cases are weighted lower and therefore their contribution to the overall performance is reduced. This is a fairer representation since the system should not be expected to perform as well on the less reliable instances as it does on the clear-cut instances. Essentially, if humans cannot consistently decide whether 511 [n=93] [n=1 14] Agreement Bin [n=71 6] Figure 2: Unweighted precision/recall by agreement bins for LM & PERC. a case is an error then a system’s output cannot be considered entirely right or entirely wrong.4 As an added advantage, the weighted measures are more stable. Consider a contentious instance in a small dataset where 7 out of 15 Turkers (a minority) classified it as Error. However, it might easily have happened that 8 Turkers (a majority) classified it as Error instead of 7. In that case, the change in unweighted precision would have been much larger than is warranted by such a small change in the data. However, weighted precision is guaranteed to be more stable. Note that the instability decreases as the size of the dataset increases but still remains a problem. 4.2 Enabling System Comparison In this section, we show how to easily compare different systems both on the same data (in the ideal case of a shared dataset being available) and, more realistically, on different datasets. Figure 2 shows (unweighted) precision and recall of LM and PERC (computed against the majority Turker judgment) for three agreement bins, where each bin is defined as containing only the instances with Turker agreement in a specific range. We chose the bins shown 4The difference between unweighted and weighted measures can vary depending on the distribution of agreement. since they are sufficiently large and represent a reasonable stratification of the agreement space. Note that we are not weighting the precision and recall in this case since we have already used the agreement proportions to create the bins. This curve enables us to compare the two systems easily on different levels of item contentiousness and, therefore, conveys much more information than what is usually reported (a single number for unweighted precision/recall over the whole corpus). For example, from this graph, PERC is seen to have similar performance as LM for the 75-90% agreement bin. In addition, even though LM precision is perfect (1.0) for the most contentious instances (the 50-75% bin), this turns out to be an artifact of the LM classifier’s decision process. When it must decide between what it views as two equally likely possibilities, it defaults to OK. Therefore, even though LM has higher unweighted precision (0.957) than PERC (0.813), it is only really better on the most clear-cut cases (the 90-100% bin). If one were to report unweighted precision and recall without using any bins—as is the norm—this important qualification would have been harder to discover. While this example uses the same dataset for evaluating two systems, the procedure is general enough to allow two systems to be compared on two different datasets by simply examining the two plots. However, two potential issues arise in that case. The first is that the bin sizes will likely vary across the two plots. However, this should not be a significant problem as long as the bins are sufficiently large. A second, more serious, issue is that the error rates (the proportion of instances that are actually erroneous) in each bin may be different across the two plots. To handle this, we recommend that a kappa-agreement plot be used instead of the precision-agreement plot shown here. 5 Conclusions Our goal is to propose best practices to address the two primary problems in evaluating grammatical error detection systems and we do so by leveraging crowdsourcing. For system development, we rec- ommend that rather than compressing multiple judgments down to the majority, it is better to use agreement proportions to weight precision and recall to 512 yield fairer and more stable indicators of performance. For system comparison, we argue that the best solution is to use a shared dataset and present the precision-agreement plot using a set of agreed-upon bins (possibly in conjunction with the weighted precision and recall measures) for a more informative comparison. However, we recognize that shared datasets are harder to create in this field (as most of the data is proprietary). Therefore, we also provide a way to compare multiple systems across different datasets by using kappa-agreement plots. As for agreement bins, we posit that the agreement values used to define them depend on the task and, therefore, should be determined by the community. Note that both of these practices can also be implemented by using 20 experts instead of 20 Turkers. However, we show that crowdsourcing yields judgments that are as good but without the cost. To facilitate the adoption of these practices, we make all our evaluation code and data available to the com- munity.5 Acknowledgments We would first like to thank our expert annotators Sarah Ohls and Waverely VanWinkle for their hours of hard work.

<p>Author: Ryo Nagata ; Edward Whittaker ; Vera Sheinman</p><p>Abstract: The availability of learner corpora, especially those which have been manually error-tagged or shallow-parsed, is still limited. This means that researchers do not have a common development and test set for natural language processing of learner English such as for grammatical error detection. Given this background, we created a novel learner corpus that was manually error-tagged and shallowparsed. This corpus is available for research and educational purposes on the web. In this paper, we describe it in detail together with its data-collection method and annotation schemes. Another contribution of this paper is that we take the first step toward evaluating the performance of existing POStagging/chunking techniques on learner corpora using the created corpus. These contributions will facilitate further research in related areas such as grammatical error detection and automated essay scoring.</p><p>2 0.88596892 <a title="88-lsi-2" href="./acl-2011-Grammatical_Error_Correction_with_Alternating_Structure_Optimization.html">147 acl-2011-Grammatical Error Correction with Alternating Structure Optimization</a></p>

At runtime, the given passage submitted by the learner is matched using an extended Levenshtein algorithm against the set of pattern rules in order to detect errors and provide suggestions.

<p>Author: Nitin Madnani ; Martin Chodorow ; Joel Tetreault ; Alla Rozovskaya</p><p>Abstract: Despite the rising interest in developing grammatical error detection systems for non-native speakers of English, progress in the field has been hampered by a lack of informative metrics and an inability to directly compare the performance of systems developed by different researchers. In this paper we address these problems by presenting two evaluation methodologies, both based on a novel use of crowdsourcing. 1 Motivation and Contributions One of the fastest growing areas in need of NLP tools is the field of grammatical error detection for learners of English as a Second Language (ESL). According to Guo and Beckett (2007), “over a billion people speak English as their second or for- eign language.” This high demand has resulted in many NLP research papers on the topic, a Synthesis Series book (Leacock et al., 2010) and a recurring workshop (Tetreault et al., 2010a), all in the last five years. In this year’s ACL conference, there are four long papers devoted to this topic. Despite the growing interest, two major factors encumber the growth of this subfield. First, the lack of consistent and appropriate score reporting is an issue. Most work reports results in the form of precision and recall as measured against the judgment of a single human rater. This is problematic because most usage errors (such as those in article and preposition usage) are a matter of degree rather than simple rule violations such as number agreement. As a consequence, it is common for two native speakers 508 to have different judgments of usage. Therefore, an appropriate evaluation should take this into account by not only enlisting multiple human judges but also aggregating these judgments in a graded manner. Second, systems are hardly ever compared to each other. In fact, to our knowledge, no two systems developed by different groups have been compared directly within the field primarily because there is no common corpus or shared task—both commonly found in other NLP areas such as machine translation.1 For example, Tetreault and Chodorow (2008), Gamon et al. (2008) and Felice and Pulman (2008) developed preposition error detection systems, but evaluated on three different corpora using different evaluation measures. The goal of this paper is to address the above issues by using crowdsourcing, which has been proven effective for collecting multiple, reliable judgments in other NLP tasks: machine translation (Callison-Burch, 2009; Zaidan and CallisonBurch, 2010), speech recognition (Evanini et al., 2010; Novotney and Callison-Burch, 2010), automated paraphrase generation (Madnani, 2010), anaphora resolution (Chamberlain et al., 2009), word sense disambiguation (Akkaya et al., 2010), lexicon construction for less commonly taught languages (Irvine and Klementiev, 2010), fact mining (Wang and Callison-Burch, 2010) and named entity recognition (Finin et al., 2010) among several others. In particular, we make a significant contribution to the field by showing how to leverage crowdsourc1There has been a recent proposal for a related shared task (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2010) that shows promise.

Our solution is general enough for, in the simplest case, intrinsically evaluating a single system on a single dataset and, more realistically, comparing two different systems (from same or different groups). 2 A Case Study: Extraneous Prepositions We consider the problem of detecting an extraneous preposition error, i.e., incorrectly using a preposition where none is licensed. In the sentence “They came to outside”, the preposition to is an extraneous error whereas in the sentence “They arrived to the town” the preposition to is a confusion error (cf. arrived in the town). Most work on automated correction of preposition errors, with the exception of Gamon (2010), addresses preposition confusion errors e.g., (Felice and Pulman, 2008; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010b). One reason is that in addition to the standard context-based features used to detect confusion errors, identifying extraneous prepositions also requires actual knowledge of when a preposition can and cannot be used. Despite this lack of attention, extraneous prepositions account for a significant proportion—as much as 18% in essays by advanced English learners (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010a)—of all preposition usage errors. 2.1 Data and Systems For the experiments in this paper, we chose a proprietary corpus of about 500,000 essays written by ESL students for Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL?R). Despite being common ESL errors, preposition errors are still infrequent overall, with over 90% of prepositions being used correctly (Leacock et al., 2010; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010a). Given this fact about error sparsity, we needed an efficient method to extract a good number of error instances (for statistical reliability) from the large essay corpus. We found all trigrams in our essays containing prepositions as the middle word (e.g., marry with her) and then looked up the counts of each tri- gram and the corresponding bigram with the preposition removed (marry her) in the Google Web1T 5-gram Corpus. If the trigram was unattested or had a count much lower than expected based on the bi509 gram count, then we manually inspected the trigram to see whether it was actually an error. If it was, we extracted a sentence from the large essay corpus containing this erroneous trigram. Once we had extracted 500 sentences containing extraneous preposition error instances, we added 500 sentences containing correct instances of preposition usage. This yielded a corpus of 1000 sentences with a 50% error rate. These sentences, with the target preposition highlighted, were presented to 3 expert annotators who are native English speakers. They were asked to annotate the preposition usage instance as one of the following: extraneous (Error), not extraneous (OK) or too hard to decide (Unknown); the last category was needed for cases where the context was too messy to make a decision about the highlighted preposition. On average, the three experts had an agreement of 0.87 and a kappa of 0.75. For subse- quent analysis, we only use the classes Error and OK since Unknown was used extremely rarely and never by all 3 experts for the same sentence. We used two different error detection systems to illustrate our evaluation methodology:2 • • 3 LM: A 4-gram language model trained on tLhMe Google Wme lba1nTg 5-gram Corpus dw oithn SRILM (Stolcke, 2002).

Crowdsourcing Recently,we showed that Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) is a cheap and effective alternative to expert raters for annotating preposition errors (Tetreault et al., 2010b). In other current work, we have extended this pilot study to show that CrowdFlower, a crowdsourcing service that allows for stronger quality con- × trol on untrained human raters (henceforth, Turkers), is more reliable than AMT on three different error detection tasks (article errors, confused prepositions 2Any conclusions drawn in this paper pertain only to these specific instantiations of the two systems. & extraneous prepositions). To impose such quality control, one has to provide “gold” instances, i.e., examples with known correct judgments that are then used to root out any Turkers with low performance on these instances. For all three tasks, we obtained 20 Turkers’ judgments via CrowdFlower for each instance and found that, on average, only 3 Turkers were required to match the experts. More specifically, for the extraneous preposition error task, we used 75 sentences as gold and obtained judgments for the remaining 923 non-gold sentences.3 We found that if we used 3 Turker judgments in a majority vote, the agreement with any one of the three expert raters is, on average, 0.87 with a kappa of 0.76. This is on par with the inter-expert agreement and kappa found earlier (0.87 and 0.75 respectively). The extraneous preposition annotation cost only $325 (923 judgments 20 Turkers) and was com- pleted 9in2 a single day. T 2h0e only rres)st arnicdtio wna on tmheTurkers was that they be physically located in the USA. For the analysis in subsequent sections, we use these 923 sentences and the respective 20 judgments obtained via CrowdFlower. The 3 expert judgments are not used any further in this analysis. 4 Revamping System Evaluation In this section, we provide details on how crowdsourcing can help revamp the evaluation of error detection systems: (a) by providing more informative measures for the intrinsic evaluation of a single system (§ 4. 1), and (b) by easily enabling system comparison (§ 4.2). 4.1 Crowd-informed Evaluation Measures When evaluating the performance of grammatical error detection systems against human judgments, the judgments for each instance are generally reduced to the single most frequent category: Error or OK. This reduction is not an accurate reflection of a complex phenomenon. It discards valuable information about the acceptability of usage because it treats all “bad” uses as equal (and all good ones as equal), when they are not. Arguably, it would be fairer to use a continuous scale, such as the proportion of raters who judge an instance as correct or 3We found 2 duplicate sentences and removed them. 510 incorrect. For example, if 90% of raters agree on a rating of Error for an instance of preposition usage, then that is stronger evidence that the usage is an error than if 56% of Turkers classified it as Error and 44% classified it as OK (the sentence “In addition classmates play with some game and enjoy” is an example). The regular measures of precision and recall would be fairer if they reflected this reality. Besides fairness, another reason to use a continuous scale is that of stability, particularly with a small number of instances in the evaluation set (quite common in the field). By relying on majority judgments, precision and recall measures tend to be unstable (see below). We modify the measures of precision and recall to incorporate distributions of correctness, obtained via crowdsourcing, in order to make them fairer and more stable indicators of system performance. Given an error detection system that classifies a sentence containing a specific preposition as Error (class 1) if the preposition is extraneous and OK (class 0) otherwise, we propose the following weighted versions of hits (Hw), misses (Mw) and false positives (FPw): XN Hw = X(csiys ∗ picrowd) (1) Xi XN Mw = X((1 − csiys) ∗ picrowd) (2) Xi XN FPw = X(csiys ∗ (1 − picrowd)) (3) Xi In the above equations, N is the total number of instances, csiys is the class (1 or 0) , and picrowd indicates the proportion of the crowd that classified instance i as Error. Note that if we were to revert to the majority crowd judgment as the sole judgment for each instance, instead of proportions, picrowd would always be either 1 or 0 and the above formulae would simply compute the normal hits, misses and false positives. Given these definitions, weighted precision can be defined as Precisionw = Hw/(Hw Hw/(Hw + FPw) and weighted + Mw). recall as Recallw = agreement Figure 1: Histogram of Turker agreements for all 923 instances on whether a preposition is extraneous. UWnwei gihg tede Pr0 e.c9 i5s0i70onR0 .e3 c78al14l Table 1: Comparing commonly used (unweighted) and proposed (weighted) precision/recall measures for LM. To illustrate the utility of these weighted measures, we evaluated the LM and PERC systems on the dataset containing 923 preposition instances, against all 20 Turker judgments. Figure 1 shows a histogram of the Turker agreement for the majority rating over the set. Table 1 shows both the unweighted (discrete majority judgment) and weighted (continuous Turker proportion) versions of precision and recall for this system. The numbers clearly show that in the unweighted case, the performance of the system is overestimated simply because the system is getting as much credit for each contentious case (low agreement) as for each clear one (high agreement). In the weighted measure we propose, the contentious cases are weighted lower and therefore their contribution to the overall performance is reduced. This is a fairer representation since the system should not be expected to perform as well on the less reliable instances as it does on the clear-cut instances. Essentially, if humans cannot consistently decide whether 511 [n=93] [n=1 14] Agreement Bin [n=71 6] Figure 2: Unweighted precision/recall by agreement bins for LM & PERC. a case is an error then a system’s output cannot be considered entirely right or entirely wrong.4 As an added advantage, the weighted measures are more stable. Consider a contentious instance in a small dataset where 7 out of 15 Turkers (a minority) classified it as Error. However, it might easily have happened that 8 Turkers (a majority) classified it as Error instead of 7. In that case, the change in unweighted precision would have been much larger than is warranted by such a small change in the data. However, weighted precision is guaranteed to be more stable. Note that the instability decreases as the size of the dataset increases but still remains a problem. 4.2 Enabling System Comparison In this section, we show how to easily compare different systems both on the same data (in the ideal case of a shared dataset being available) and, more realistically, on different datasets. Figure 2 shows (unweighted) precision and recall of LM and PERC (computed against the majority Turker judgment) for three agreement bins, where each bin is defined as containing only the instances with Turker agreement in a specific range. We chose the bins shown 4The difference between unweighted and weighted measures can vary depending on the distribution of agreement. since they are sufficiently large and represent a reasonable stratification of the agreement space. Note that we are not weighting the precision and recall in this case since we have already used the agreement proportions to create the bins. This curve enables us to compare the two systems easily on different levels of item contentiousness and, therefore, conveys much more information than what is usually reported (a single number for unweighted precision/recall over the whole corpus). For example, from this graph, PERC is seen to have similar performance as LM for the 75-90% agreement bin. In addition, even though LM precision is perfect (1.0) for the most contentious instances (the 50-75% bin), this turns out to be an artifact of the LM classifier’s decision process. When it must decide between what it views as two equally likely possibilities, it defaults to OK. Therefore, even though LM has higher unweighted precision (0.957) than PERC (0.813), it is only really better on the most clear-cut cases (the 90-100% bin). If one were to report unweighted precision and recall without using any bins—as is the norm—this important qualification would have been harder to discover. While this example uses the same dataset for evaluating two systems, the procedure is general enough to allow two systems to be compared on two different datasets by simply examining the two plots. However, two potential issues arise in that case. The first is that the bin sizes will likely vary across the two plots. However, this should not be a significant problem as long as the bins are sufficiently large. A second, more serious, issue is that the error rates (the proportion of instances that are actually erroneous) in each bin may be different across the two plots. To handle this, we recommend that a kappa-agreement plot be used instead of the precision-agreement plot shown here. 5 Conclusions Our goal is to propose best practices to address the two primary problems in evaluating grammatical error detection systems and we do so by leveraging crowdsourcing. For system development, we rec- ommend that rather than compressing multiple judgments down to the majority, it is better to use agreement proportions to weight precision and recall to 512 yield fairer and more stable indicators of performance. For system comparison, we argue that the best solution is to use a shared dataset and present the precision-agreement plot using a set of agreed-upon bins (possibly in conjunction with the weighted precision and recall measures) for a more informative comparison. However, we recognize that shared datasets are harder to create in this field (as most of the data is proprietary). Therefore, we also provide a way to compare multiple systems across different datasets by using kappa-agreement plots. As for agreement bins, we posit that the agreement values used to define them depend on the task and, therefore, should be determined by the community. Note that both of these practices can also be implemented by using 20 experts instead of 20 Turkers. However, we show that crowdsourcing yields judgments that are as good but without the cost. To facilitate the adoption of these practices, we make all our evaluation code and data available to the com- munity.5 Acknowledgments We would first like to thank our expert annotators Sarah Ohls and Waverely VanWinkle for their hours of hard work.

<p>Author: Alla Rozovskaya ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of correcting errors made by English as a Second Language (ESL) writers and address two issues that are essential to making progress in ESL error correction - algorithm selection and model adaptation to the first language of the ESL learner. A variety of learning algorithms have been applied to correct ESL mistakes, but often comparisons were made between incomparable data sets. We conduct an extensive, fair comparison of four popular learning methods for the task, reversing conclusions from earlier evaluations. Our results hold for different training sets, genres, and feature sets. A second key issue in ESL error correction is the adaptation of a model to the first language ofthe writer. Errors made by non-native speakers exhibit certain regularities and, as we show, models perform much better when they use knowledge about error patterns of the nonnative writers. We propose a novel way to adapt a learned algorithm to the first language of the writer that is both cheaper to implement and performs better than other adaptation methods.</p><p>6 0.68093383 <a title="88-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Automated_Whole_Sentence_Grammar_Correction_Using_a_Noisy_Channel_Model.html">46 acl-2011-Automated Whole Sentence Grammar Correction Using a Noisy Channel Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Ryo Nagata ; Edward Whittaker ; Vera Sheinman</p><p>Abstract: The availability of learner corpora, especially those which have been manually error-tagged or shallow-parsed, is still limited. This means that researchers do not have a common development and test set for natural language processing of learner English such as for grammatical error detection. Given this background, we created a novel learner corpus that was manually error-tagged and shallowparsed. This corpus is available for research and educational purposes on the web. In this paper, we describe it in detail together with its data-collection method and annotation schemes. Another contribution of this paper is that we take the first step toward evaluating the performance of existing POStagging/chunking techniques on learner corpora using the created corpus. These contributions will facilitate further research in related areas such as grammatical error detection and automated essay scoring.</p><p>2 0.83521712 <a title="88-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Recognizing_Named_Entities_in_Tweets.html">261 acl-2011-Recognizing Named Entities in Tweets</a></p>

We propose to combine a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier with a linear Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model under a semi-supervised learning framework to tackle these challenges. The KNN based classifier conducts pre-labeling to collect global coarse evidence across tweets while the CRF model conducts sequential labeling to capture fine-grained information encoded in a tweet. The semi-supervised learning plus the gazetteers alleviate the lack of training data.

Our algorithm is restricted in that only the virtual instructor can perform speech acts while the user responses are limited to physical actions in the virtual world. We evaluate a virtual instructor, generated using this algorithm, with human users. We compare our results both with human instructors and rule-based virtual instructors hand-coded for the same task.</p><p>4 0.82946318 <a title="88-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Data-oriented_Monologue-to-Dialogue_Generation.html">91 acl-2011-Data-oriented Monologue-to-Dialogue Generation</a></p>
<p>Author: Paul Piwek ; Svetlana Stoyanchev</p><p>Abstract: This short paper introduces an implemented and evaluated monolingual Text-to-Text generation system. The system takes monologue and transforms it to two-participant dialogue. After briefly motivating the task of monologue-to-dialogue generation, we describe the system and present an evaluation in terms of fluency and accuracy.</p><p>5 0.8184998 <a title="88-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Extracting_Comparative_Entities_and_Predicates_from_Texts_Using_Comparative_Type_Classification.html">130 acl-2011-Extracting Comparative Entities and Predicates from Texts Using Comparative Type Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Seon Yang ; Youngjoong Ko</p><p>Abstract: The automatic extraction of comparative information is an important text mining problem and an area of increasing interest. In this paper, we study how to build a Korean comparison mining system. Our work is composed of two consecutive tasks: 1) classifying comparative sentences into different types and 2) mining comparative entities and predicates. We perform various experiments to find relevant features and learning techniques. As a result, we achieve outstanding performance enough for practical use. 1</p><p>6 0.80104518 <a title="88-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Generalized_Interpolation_in_Decision_Tree_LM.html">142 acl-2011-Generalized Interpolation in Decision Tree LM</a></p>

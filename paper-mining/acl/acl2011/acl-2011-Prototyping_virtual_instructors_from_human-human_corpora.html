<p>Author: Nina Dethlefs ; Heriberto Cuayahuitl</p><p>Abstract: Surface realisation decisions in language generation can be sensitive to a language model, but also to decisions of content selection. We therefore propose the joint optimisation of content selection and surface realisation using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). To this end, we suggest a novel reward function that is induced from human data and is especially suited for surface realisation. It is based on a generation space in the form of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Results in terms of task success and human-likeness suggest that our unified approach performs better than greedy or random baselines.</p><p>3 0.156065 <a title="252-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Joint_Identification_and_Segmentation_of_Domain-Specific_Dialogue_Acts_for_Conversational_Dialogue_Systems.html">185 acl-2011-Joint Identification and Segmentation of Domain-Specific Dialogue Acts for Conversational Dialogue Systems</a></p>

We combine several graph alignment features with lexical semantic similarity measures using machine learning techniques and show that the student answers can be more accurately graded than if the semantic measures were used in isolation. We also present a first attempt to align the dependency graphs of the student and the instructor answers in order to make use of a structural component in the automatic grading of student answers.</p><p>5 0.10404777 <a title="252-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Terminal-Aware_Synchronous_Binarization.html">296 acl-2011-Terminal-Aware Synchronous Binarization</a></p>

<p>Author: Sharon Gower Small ; Jennifer Strommer-Galley ; Tomek Strzalkowski</p><p>Abstract: We describe an annotation tool developed to assist in the creation of multimodal actioncommunication corpora from on-line massively multi-player games, or MMGs. MMGs typically involve groups of players (5-30) who control their perform various activities (questing, competing, fighting, etc.) and communicate via chat or speech using assumed screen names. We collected a corpus of 48 group quests in Second Life that jointly involved 206 players who generated over 30,000 messages in quasisynchronous chat during approximately 140 hours of recorded action. Multiple levels of coordinated annotation of this corpus (dialogue, movements, touch, gaze, wear, etc) are required in order to support development of automated predictors of selected real-life social and demographic characteristics of the players. The annotation tool presented in this paper was developed to enable efficient and accurate annotation of all dimensions simultaneously. avatars1, 1</p><p>4 0.58536035 <a title="252-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Multimodal_Menu-based_Dialogue_with_Speech_Cursor_in_DICO_II%2B.html">227 acl-2011-Multimodal Menu-based Dialogue with Speech Cursor in DICO II+</a></p>

<p>Author: S.R.K Branavan ; David Silver ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for leveraging automatically extracted textual knowledge to improve the performance of control applications such as games. Our ultimate goal is to enrich a stochastic player with highlevel guidance expressed in text. Our model jointly learns to identify text that is relevant to a given game state in addition to learning game strategies guided by the selected text. Our method operates in the Monte-Carlo search framework, and learns both text analysis and game strategies based only on environment feedback. We apply our approach to the complex strategy game Civilization II using the official game manual as the text guide. Our results show that a linguistically-informed game-playing agent significantly outperforms its language-unaware counterpart, yielding a 27% absolute improvement and winning over 78% of games when playing against the built- . in AI of Civilization II. 1</p><p>6 0.54882556 <a title="252-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Discrete_vs._Continuous_Rating_Scales_for_Language_Evaluation_in_NLP.html">99 acl-2011-Discrete vs. Continuous Rating Scales for Language Evaluation in NLP</a></p>

<p>Author: Masato Hagiwara ; Satoshi Sekine</p><p>Abstract: Transliteration, a rich source of proper noun spelling variations, is usually recognized by phonetic- or spelling-based models. However, a single model cannot deal with different words from different language origins, e.g., “get” in “piaget” and “target.” Li et al. (2007) propose a method which explicitly models and classifies the source language origins and switches transliteration models accordingly. This model, however, requires an explicitly tagged training set with language origins. We propose a novel method which models language origins as latent classes. The parameters are learned from a set of transliterated word pairs via the EM algorithm. The experimental results of the transliteration task of Western names to Japanese show that the proposed model can achieve higher accuracy compared to the conventional models without latent classes.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.80710155 <a title="252-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Prototyping_virtual_instructors_from_human-human_corpora.html">252 acl-2011-Prototyping virtual instructors from human-human corpora</a></p>

<p>Author: Taniya Mishra ; Srinivas Bangalore</p><p>Abstract: There are several theories regarding what influences prominence assignment in English noun-noun compounds. We have developed corpus-driven models for automatically predicting prominence assignment in noun-noun compounds using feature sets based on two such theories: the informativeness theory and the semantic composition theory. The evaluation of the prediction models indicate that though both of these theories are relevant, they account for different types of variability in prominence assignment.</p><p>4 0.75933099 <a title="252-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-PsychoSentiWordNet.html">253 acl-2011-PsychoSentiWordNet</a></p>
<p>Author: Amitava Das</p><p>Abstract: Sentiment analysis is one of the hot demanding research areas since last few decades. Although a formidable amount of research has been done but still the existing reported solutions or available systems are far from perfect or to meet the satisfaction level of end user's. The main issue may be there are many conceptual rules that govern sentiment, and there are even more clues (possibly unlimited) that can convey these concepts from realization to verbalization of a human being. Human psychology directly relates to the unrevealed clues; govern the sentiment realization of us. Human psychology relates many things like social psychology, culture, pragmatics and many more endless intelligent aspects of civilization. Proper incorporation of human psychology into computational sentiment knowledge representation may solve the problem. PsychoSentiWordNet is an extension over SentiWordNet that holds human psychological knowledge and sentiment knowledge simultaneously. 1</p><p>5 0.75905144 <a title="252-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Social_Network_Extraction_from_Texts%3A_A_Thesis_Proposal.html">286 acl-2011-Social Network Extraction from Texts: A Thesis Proposal</a></p>
<p>Author: Apoorv Agarwal</p><p>Abstract: In my thesis, Ipropose to build a system that would enable extraction of social interactions from texts. To date Ihave defined a comprehensive set of social events and built a preliminary system that extracts social events from news articles. Iplan to improve the performance of my current system by incorporating semantic information. Using domain adaptation techniques, Ipropose to apply my system to a wide range of genres. By extracting linguistic constructs relevant to social interactions, I will be able to empirically analyze different kinds of linguistic constructs that people use to express social interactions. Lastly, I will attempt to make convolution kernels more scalable and interpretable.</p><p>6 0.75870085 <a title="252-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Identifying_Word_Translations_from_Comparable_Corpora_Using_Latent_Topic_Models.html">161 acl-2011-Identifying Word Translations from Comparable Corpora Using Latent Topic Models</a></p>

<p>Author: John DeNero ; Klaus Macherey</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised word alignment is most often modeled as a Markov process that generates a sentence f conditioned on its translation e. A similar model generating e from f will make different alignment predictions. Statistical machine translation systems combine the predictions of two directional models, typically using heuristic combination procedures like grow-diag-final. This paper presents a graphical model that embeds two directional aligners into a single model. Inference can be performed via dual decomposition, which reuses the efficient inference algorithms of the directional models. Our bidirectional model enforces a one-to-one phrase constraint while accounting for the uncertainty in the underlying directional models. The resulting alignments improve upon baseline combination heuristics in word-level and phrase-level evaluations.</p><p>3 0.36374521 <a title="152-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Bayesian_Word_Alignment_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">57 acl-2011-Bayesian Word Alignment for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Coskun Mermer ; Murat Saraclar</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we compare the translation performance of word alignments obtained via Bayesian inference to those obtained via expectation-maximization (EM). We propose a Gibbs sampler for fully Bayesian inference in IBM Model 1, integrating over all possible parameter values in finding the alignment distribution. We show that Bayesian inference outperforms EM in all of the tested language pairs, domains and data set sizes, by up to 2.99 BLEU points. We also show that the proposed method effectively addresses the well-known rare word problem in EM-estimated models; and at the same time induces a much smaller dictionary of bilingual word-pairs. .t r</p><p>4 0.34949401 <a title="152-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Word_Alignment_Combination_over_Multiple_Word_Segmentation.html">339 acl-2011-Word Alignment Combination over Multiple Word Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ning Xi ; Guangchao Tang ; Boyuan Li ; Yinggong Zhao</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a new word alignment combination approach on language pairs where one language has no explicit word boundaries. Instead of combining word alignments of different models (Xiang et al., 2010), we try to combine word alignments over multiple monolingually motivated word segmentation. Our approach is based on link confidence score defined over multiple segmentations, thus the combined alignment is more robust to inappropriate word segmentation. Our combination algorithm is simple, efficient, and easy to implement. In the Chinese-English experiment, our approach effectively improved word alignment quality as well as translation performance on all segmentations simultaneously, which showed that word alignment can benefit from complementary knowledge due to the diversity of multiple and monolingually motivated segmentations. 1</p><p>5 0.34086531 <a title="152-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Unsupervised_Word_Alignment_with_Arbitrary_Features.html">325 acl-2011-Unsupervised Word Alignment with Arbitrary Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Mohit Bansal ; Chris Quirk ; Robert Moore</p><p>Abstract: We propose a principled and efficient phraseto-phrase alignment model, useful in machine translation as well as other related natural language processing problems. In a hidden semiMarkov model, word-to-phrase and phraseto-word translations are modeled directly by the system. Agreement between two directional models encourages the selection of parsimonious phrasal alignments, avoiding the overfitting commonly encountered in unsupervised training with multi-word units. Expanding the state space to include “gappy phrases” (such as French ne ? pas) makes the alignment space more symmetric; thus, it allows agreement between discontinuous alignments. The resulting system shows substantial improvements in both alignment quality and translation quality over word-based Hidden Markov Models, while maintaining asymptotically equivalent runtime.</p><p>3 0.88752764 <a title="152-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-Model-Based_Aligner_Combination_Using_Dual_Decomposition.html">221 acl-2011-Model-Based Aligner Combination Using Dual Decomposition</a></p>

<p>Author: Wang Ling ; Tiago Luis ; Joao Graca ; Isabel Trancoso ; Luisa Coheur</p><p>Abstract: In most statistical machine translation systems, the phrase/rule extraction algorithm uses alignments in the 1-best form, which might contain spurious alignment points. The usage ofweighted alignment matrices that encode all possible alignments has been shown to generate better phrase tables for phrase-based systems. We propose two algorithms to generate the well known MSD reordering model using weighted alignment matrices. Experiments on the IWSLT 2010 evaluation datasets for two language pairs with different alignment algorithms show that our methods produce more accurate reordering models, as can be shown by an increase over the regular MSD models of 0.4 BLEU points in the BTEC French to English test set, and of 1.5 BLEU points in the DIALOG Chinese to English test set.</p><p>6 0.87260336 <a title="152-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Bayesian_Word_Alignment_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">57 acl-2011-Bayesian Word Alignment for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Joel Lang ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we describe an unsupervised method for semantic role induction which holds promise for relieving the data acquisition bottleneck associated with supervised role labelers. We present an algorithm that iteratively splits and merges clusters representing semantic roles, thereby leading from an initial clustering to a final clustering of better quality. The method is simple, surprisingly effective, and allows to integrate linguistic knowledge transparently. By combining role induction with a rule-based component for argument identification we obtain an unsupervised end-to-end semantic role labeling system. Evaluation on the CoNLL 2008 benchmark dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms competitive unsupervised approaches by a wide margin.</p><p>3 0.92794782 <a title="152-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-ParaSense_or_How_to_Use_Parallel_Corpora_for_Word_Sense_Disambiguation.html">240 acl-2011-ParaSense or How to Use Parallel Corpora for Word Sense Disambiguation</a></p>
<p>Author: Els Lefever ; Veronique Hoste ; Martine De Cock</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a set of exploratory experiments for a multilingual classificationbased approach to Word Sense Disambiguation. Instead of using a predefined monolingual sense-inventory such as WordNet, we use a language-independent framework where the word senses are derived automatically from word alignments on a parallel corpus. We built five classifiers with English as an input language and translations in the five supported languages (viz. French, Dutch, Italian, Spanish and German) as classification output. The feature vectors incorporate both the more traditional local context features, as well as binary bag-of-words features that are extracted from the aligned translations. Our results show that the ParaSense multilingual WSD system shows very competitive results compared to the best systems that were evaluated on the SemEval-2010 Cross-Lingual Word Sense Disambiguation task for all five target languages.</p><p>4 0.92387581 <a title="152-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-An_Empirical_Evaluation_of_Data-Driven_Paraphrase_Generation_Techniques.html">37 acl-2011-An Empirical Evaluation of Data-Driven Paraphrase Generation Techniques</a></p>
<p>Author: Donald Metzler ; Eduard Hovy ; Chunliang Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Paraphrase generation is an important task that has received a great deal of interest recently. Proposed data-driven solutions to the problem have ranged from simple approaches that make minimal use of NLP tools to more complex approaches that rely on numerous language-dependent resources. Despite all of the attention, there have been very few direct empirical evaluations comparing the merits of the different approaches. This paper empirically examines the tradeoffs between simple and sophisticated paraphrase harvesting approaches to help shed light on their strengths and weaknesses. Our evaluation reveals that very simple approaches fare surprisingly well and have a number of distinct advantages, including strong precision, good coverage, and low redundancy.</p><p>5 0.92292821 <a title="152-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Simple_English_Wikipedia%3A_A_New_Text_Simplification_Task.html">283 acl-2011-Simple English Wikipedia: A New Text Simplification Task</a></p>
<p>Author: William Coster ; David Kauchak</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we examine the task of sentence simplification which aims to reduce the reading complexity of a sentence by incorporating more accessible vocabulary and sentence structure. We introduce a new data set that pairs English Wikipedia with Simple English Wikipedia and is orders of magnitude larger than any previously examined for sentence simplification. The data contains the full range of simplification operations including rewording, reordering, insertion and deletion. We provide an analysis of this corpus as well as preliminary results using a phrase-based trans- lation approach for simplification.</p><p>6 0.92180061 <a title="152-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Scaling_up_Automatic_Cross-Lingual_Semantic_Role_Annotation.html">269 acl-2011-Scaling up Automatic Cross-Lingual Semantic Role Annotation</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael Auli ; Adam Lopez</p><p>Abstract: We present a systematic comparison and combination of two orthogonal techniques for efficient parsing of Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG). First we consider adaptive supertagging, a widely used approximate search technique that prunes most lexical categories from the parserâ€™s search space using a separate sequence model. Next we consider several variants on A*, a classic exact search technique which to our knowledge has not been applied to more expressive grammar formalisms like CCG. In addition to standard hardware-independent measures of parser effort we also present what we believe is the first evaluation of A* parsing on the more realistic but more stringent metric of CPU time. By itself, A* substantially reduces parser effort as measured by the number of edges considered during parsing, but we show that for CCG this does not always correspond to improvements in CPU time over a CKY baseline. Combining A* with adaptive supertagging decreases CPU time by 15% for our best model.</p><p>3 0.42701995 <a title="5-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Shift-Reduce_CCG_Parsing.html">282 acl-2011-Shift-Reduce CCG Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Yue Zhang ; Stephen Clark</p><p>Abstract: CCGs are directly compatible with binarybranching bottom-up parsing algorithms, in particular CKY and shift-reduce algorithms. While the chart-based approach has been the dominant approach for CCG, the shift-reduce method has been little explored. In this paper, we develop a shift-reduce CCG parser using a discriminative model and beam search, and compare its strengths and weaknesses with the chart-based C&C; parser. We study different errors made by the two parsers, and show that the shift-reduce parser gives competitive accuracies compared to C&C.; Considering our use of a small beam, and given the high ambiguity levels in an automatically-extracted grammar and the amount of information in the CCG lexical categories which form the shift actions, this is a surprising result.</p><p>4 0.17350939 <a title="5-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Dual_Decomposition___for_Natural_Language_Processing_.html">106 acl-2011-Dual Decomposition   for Natural Language Processing </a></p>

<p>Author: John DeNero ; Klaus Macherey</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised word alignment is most often modeled as a Markov process that generates a sentence f conditioned on its translation e. A similar model generating e from f will make different alignment predictions. Statistical machine translation systems combine the predictions of two directional models, typically using heuristic combination procedures like grow-diag-final. This paper presents a graphical model that embeds two directional aligners into a single model. Inference can be performed via dual decomposition, which reuses the efficient inference algorithms of the directional models. Our bidirectional model enforces a one-to-one phrase constraint while accounting for the uncertainty in the underlying directional models. The resulting alignments improve upon baseline combination heuristics in word-level and phrase-level evaluations.</p><p>6 0.11766583 <a title="5-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Transition-based_Dependency_Parsing_with_Rich_Non-local_Features.html">309 acl-2011-Transition-based Dependency Parsing with Rich Non-local Features</a></p>

The method could theoretically be implemented on any other transition-based parser with some adjustments. In this paper, the algorithm is evaluated on CuteForce, an efficient deterministic shiftreduce HPSG parser. The backtracking strategy may serve to improve existing parsers, or to assess if a deterministic parser would benefit from backtracking as a strategy to improve parsing.</p><p>6 0.41863599 <a title="5-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-The_Surprising_Variance_in_Shortest-Derivation_Parsing.html">300 acl-2011-The Surprising Variance in Shortest-Derivation Parsing</a></p>

MACAON has been designed to process both human-produced text and highly ambiguous word-lattices produced by NLP tools. MACAON is made of several native modules for common tasks such as a tokenization, a part-of-speech tagging or syntactic parsing, all communicating with each other through XML files . In addition, exchange protocols with external tools are easily definable.

<p>Author: Hinrich Schutze</p><p>Abstract: Building on earlier work that integrates different factors in language modeling, we view (i) backing off to a shorter history and (ii) class-based generalization as two complementary mechanisms of using a larger equivalence class for prediction when the default equivalence class is too small for reliable estimation. This view entails that the classes in a language model should be learned from rare events only and should be preferably applied to rare events. We construct such a model and show that both training on rare events and preferable application to rare events improve perplexity when compared to a simple direct interpolation of class-based with standard language models.</p><p>6 0.78023785 <a title="5-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-A_Joint_Sequence_Translation_Model_with_Integrated_Reordering.html">16 acl-2011-A Joint Sequence Translation Model with Integrated Reordering</a></p>

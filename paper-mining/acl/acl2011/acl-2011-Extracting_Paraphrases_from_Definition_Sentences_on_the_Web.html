</p><p>9 On the contrary, recognizing definition sentences for the same concept is quite an easy task at least for Japanese, as we will show, and we were able to find a huge amount of definition sentence pairs from normal Web texts. [sent-45, score-0.791]

[sent-46, score-1.205]
</p><p>11 Our evaluation is based on bidirectional check-  ing of entailment relations between paraphrases that considers the context dependence of a paraphrase. [sent-49, score-0.512]
</p><p>12 Note that using definition sentences is only the beginning of our research on paraphrase extraction. [sent-50, score-0.81]
</p><p>13 2  Related Work  The existing work for paraphrase extraction is categorized into two groups. [sent-61, score-0.486]
</p><p>14 These methods can be applied to a normal monolingual corpus, and it has been shown that a large number of paraphrases or entailment rules could be extracted. [sent-67, score-0.469]
</p><p>15 Another limitation of these methods is that they can find only paraphrases consisting of frequently observed expressions since they must have reliable distributional similarity values for expressions that constitute paraphrases. [sent-73, score-0.453]
</p><p>16 We avoid this by using definition sentences, which can be easily acquired on a large scale from the Web, as parallel corpora. [sent-83, score-0.368]
</p><p>17 (2004) used definition sentences in two manually compiled dictionaries, which are considerably fewer in the number of definition sentences than those on the Web. [sent-85, score-0.648]
</p><p>18 3  Proposed method  Our method, targeting the Japanese language, consists of two steps: definition sentence acquisition  ×  and paraphrase extraction. [sent-89, score-0.87]
</p><p>19 Although the particle sequence tends to mark the topic of the definition sentence, it can also appear in interrogative sentences and normal assertive sentences in which a topic is strongly emphasized. [sent-101, score-0.474]
</p><p>20 After adding definition sentences from Wikipedia articles, which are typically the first sentence of the body of each article (Kazama and Torisawa, 2007), we obtained a total of 2,141,878 definition sentence candidates, which covered 867,321 concepts ranging from weapons to rules of baseball. [sent-119, score-0.688]
</p><p>21 Then, we coupled two definition sentences whose defined concepts were the same and obtained 29,661,812 definition sentence pairs. [sent-120, score-0.633]

</p><p>36 The paraphrase checking of candidate phrase pairs is performed by an SVM classifier with a linear kernel that classifies each pair of candidate phrases into a paraphrase or a non-paraphrase. [sent-182, score-1.697]
</p><p>37 Features for the classifier are based on our observation that two candidate phrases tend to be paraphrases if the candidate phrases themselves are sufficiently similar and/or their surround-  ing contexts are sufficiently similar. [sent-184, score-0.878]
</p><p>38 In the figure, f8 has a positive value since the candidate phrase of s1 contains morphemes “of bone”, which do not appear in the can4We use SVMperf available at http : / / svml ight . [sent-190, score-0.445]

</p><p>40 s2: Osteoporosis is a disease that decreases the quantity of bone and s02: Osteoporosis is a disease that reduces bone mass and increases increases the risk of bone fracture. [sent-205, score-1.34]
</p><p>41 In preparing the training data, we faced the problem that the completely random sampling of candidate paraphrase pairs provided us with only a small number of positive examples. [sent-217, score-0.84]
</p><p>42 Thus, we automatically collected candidate paraphrase pairs that were expected to have a high likelihood of being positive as examples to be labeled. [sent-218, score-0.84]
</p><p>43 The likelihood was calculated by simply summing all of the 78 feature values that we have tried, since they indicate the likelihood of a given candidate paraphrase pair’s being a paraphrase. [sent-219, score-0.686]
</p><p>44 Specifically, we first randomly sampled 30,000 definition sentence pairs from the 29,661,812 pairs, and collected  3,000 candidate phrase pairs that had the highest likelihood from them. [sent-221, score-0.892]
</p><p>45 The manual labeling of each candidate phrase pair (p1,p2) was based on bidirectional checking of entailment relation, p1 → p2 and p2 → p1, with p1 and p2 embedded in con→text ps. [sent-222, score-0.538]
</p><p>46 We adopt this scheme since paraphrase judgment might be unstable between annotators unless they are given a particular context based on which they make a judgment. [sent-225, score-0.522]
</p><p>47 First, from each candidate phrase pair (p1,p2) and its source definition sentence pair (s1, s2), we create two paraphrase sentence pairs (s01 , s02) by exchanging p1 and p2 between s1 and s2. [sent-229, score-1.331]
</p><p>48 In this example, both entailment relations,  s01 and s2 → s02, hold, and thus the candidate phrase pair (p1,p2) sis judged as positive. [sent-232, score-0.465]
</p><p>49 6 We built the paraphrase classifier from the training data. [sent-234, score-0.486]
</p><p>50 As mentioned, candidate phrase pairs were ranked by the distance from the SVM’s hyperplane. [sent-235, score-0.393]
</p><p>51 Definition sentences on the Web are a treasure trove of paraphrase knowledge (Section 4. [sent-238, score-0.59]
</p><p>52 Our method of paraphrase acquisition from definition sentences is more accurate than wellknown competing methods (Section 4. [sent-241, score-0.885]

</p><p>54 In the latter data set, two sentences of each pair are expected to be semantically similar regardless of whether they are definition sentences. [sent-252, score-0.368]
</p><p>55 competing methods In this experiment, paraphrase pairs are extracted from 100,000 definition sentence pairs that are randomly sampled from the 29,661,812 pairs. [sent-259, score-1.146]
</p><p>56 First, it collects from the parallel sentences identical word pairs and their contexts (POS N-grams with indices indicating corresponding words between paired contexts) as positive examples and those of different word pairs as negative ones. [sent-262, score-0.446]
</p><p>57 The most likely K positive (negative) contexts are used to extract positive (negative) paraphrases from the parallel sentences. [sent-264, score-0.522]
</p><p>58 Extracted positive (negative) paraphrases and their morpho-syntactic patterns are used to collect additional positive (negative) contexts. [sent-265, score-0.389]
</p><p>59 All the positive (negative) contexts are ranked, and additional paraphrases and their morpho-syntactic patterns are extracted again. [sent-266, score-0.437]
</p><p>60 This iterative process finishes if no further paraphrase is extracted or the number of iterations reaches a predefined threshold T. [sent-267, score-0.527]
</p><p>61 Note that paraphrases extracted by this method are not ranked. [sent-271, score-0.394]
</p><p>62 If you give Moses monolingual parallel sentence pairs, it should extract a set of two phrases that are paraphrases of each other. [sent-279, score-0.526]
</p><p>63 (2004) proposed a method to extract paraphrases from two manually compiled dictionaries. [sent-285, score-0.384]
</p><p>64 It simply regards a difference between two definition sentences of the same word as a paraphrase candidate. [sent-286, score-0.81]
</p><p>65 They assume that  a paraphrase candidate tends to be a valid paraphrase if it is surrounded by infrequent strings and/or if it appears multiple times in the data. [sent-288, score-1.172]
</p><p>66 The unsupervised method works in the same way as the supervised one, except that it ranks candidate phrase pairs by the sum of all 17 feature values, instead of the distance from the SVM’s hyperplane. [sent-291, score-0.425]
</p><p>67 BM, SMT, Mrt, and the two versions of our method were used to extract paraphrase pairs from the same 100,000 definition sentence pairs. [sent-294, score-0.978]
</p><p>68 Evaluation scheme Evaluation of each paraphrase pair (p1,p2) was based on bidirectional checking of entailment relations p1 → p2 and p2 → p1 in a way similar to the labeling →of p the training data. [sent-295, score-0.751]
</p><p>69 The difference is that contexts for evaluation  are two sentences that are retrieved from the Web and contain p1 and p2, instead of definition sentences from which p1 and p2 are extracted. [sent-296, score-0.435]
</p><p>70 This is intended to check whether extracted paraphrases are also valid for contexts other than those from which they are extracted. [sent-297, score-0.403]
</p><p>71 For the top m paraphrase pairs of each method (in the case of the BM method, randomly sampled m pairs were used, since the method does not rank paraphrase pairs), we retrieved a sentence pair (s1, s2) for each paraphrase pair (p1,p2) from the Web, such that s1 contains p1 and s2 contains p2. [sent-299, score-1.975]
</p><p>72 For each method, we randomly sample n samples from all of the paraphrase pairs (p1,p2) for which both s1 and s2 are retrieved. [sent-301, score-0.639]
</p><p>73 Then, from each (p1,p2) and (s1, s2), we create two paraphrase sentence pairs (s01 , s02) by exchanging p1 and p2 between s1 and s2. [sent-302, score-0.661]
</p><p>74 We regard each paraphrase pair as correct if at least two annotatorsjudge that entailment relations ofboth directions hold for it. [sent-305, score-0.711]
</p><p>75 You may wonder whether only one pair of sentences (s1, s2) is enough for evaluation since a correct (wrong) paraphrase pair might be judged as wrong (correct) accidentally. [sent-306, score-0.644]
</p><p>76 Thus, we estimate that Sup can extract about 300,000 paraphrase pairs with a precision rate of about 94%, if we use all 29,661,812 definition sentence pairs that we acquired. [sent-315, score-1.124]
</p><p>77 Furthermore, we measured precision after trivial paraphrase pairs were discarded from the evaluation  samples of each method. [sent-316, score-0.772]
</p><p>78 The upper half of Table 2 shows the number of extracted paraphrases with/without trivial pairs for each method. [sent-322, score-0.557]
</p><p>79 As the examples indicate, many of the extracted paraphrases are not specific to definition sentences and seem very reusable. [sent-326, score-0.686]
</p><p>80 However, there are few paraphrases involving metaphors or idioms in the outputs due to the nature of definition sentences. [sent-327, score-0.575]
</p><p>81 11We set no threshold for candidate phrase pairs of each method, and counted all the candidate phrase pairs in Table 2. [sent-343, score-0.786]

</p><p>83 The lower half of Table 2 shows the number of extracted paraphrases with/without trivial pairs for each method. [sent-362, score-0.557]
</p><p>84 12 We think that a precision rate of at least 90% would be necessary if you apply automatically extracted paraphrases to NLP tasks with-  out manual annotation. [sent-365, score-0.42]
</p><p>85 Only the combination of Sup and definition sentence pairs achieved that precision. [sent-366, score-0.429]
</p><p>86 Also note that, for all of the methods, the numbers of extracted paraphrases from Web sentence pairs are fewer than those from definition sentence pairs. [sent-367, score-0.846]
</p><p>87 1095 5  Conclusion  We proposed a method of extracting paraphrases from definition sentences on the Web. [sent-372, score-0.677]
</p><p>88 Definition sentences on the Web are a treasure trove of paraphrase knowledge. [sent-375, score-0.59]
</p><p>89 Our method extracts many paraphrases from the definition sentences on the Web accurately; it can extract about 300,000 paraphrases from  ×  6 108 Web documents with a precision rate o6f × ×ab 1o0ut 94%. [sent-377, score-1.087]
</p><p>90 First, we will release extracted paraphrases from all of the 29,661,812 definition sentence pairs that we acquired, after human annotators check their validity. [sent-379, score-0.827]
</p><p>91 13 Second, we plan to induce paraphrase rules from paraphrase instances. [sent-381, score-0.972]
</p><p>92 Though our method can extract a variety of paraphrase instances on a large scale, their coverage might be insufficient for real NLP applications since some paraphrase phenomena are highly productive. [sent-382, score-1.035]
</p><p>93 Therefore, we need paraphrase rules in addition to paraphrase instances. [sent-383, score-0.972]
</p><p>94 Barzilay and McKeown (2001) induced simple POS-based paraphrase rules from paraphrase instances, which can be a good starting point. [sent-384, score-0.972]
</p><p>95 Finally, as mentioned in Section 1, the work in this paper is only the beginning of our research on paraphrase extraction. [sent-385, score-0.486]

<p>Author: Donald Metzler ; Eduard Hovy ; Chunliang Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Paraphrase generation is an important task that has received a great deal of interest recently. Proposed data-driven solutions to the problem have ranged from simple approaches that make minimal use of NLP tools to more complex approaches that rely on numerous language-dependent resources.

<p>Author: Yashar Mehdad ; Matteo Negri ; Marcello Federico</p><p>Abstract: This paper explores the use of bilingual parallel corpora as a source of lexical knowledge for cross-lingual textual entailment. We claim that, in spite of the inherent difficulties of the task, phrase tables extracted from parallel data allow to capture both lexical relations between single words, and contextual information useful for inference. We experiment with a phrasal matching method in order to: i) build a system portable across languages, and ii) evaluate the contribution of lexical knowledge in isolation, without interaction with other inference mechanisms. Results achieved on an English-Spanish corpus obtained from the RTE3 dataset support our claim, with an overall accuracy above average scores reported by RTE participants on monolingual data. Finally, we show that using parallel corpora to extract paraphrase tables reveals their potential also in the monolingual setting, improving the results achieved with other sources of lexical knowledge.</p><p>6 0.13128865 <a title="132-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Corpus_Expansion_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation_with_Semantic_Role_Label_Substitution_Rules.html">87 acl-2011-Corpus Expansion for Statistical Machine Translation with Semantic Role Label Substitution Rules</a></p>

<p>Author: Lei Zhang ; Bing Liu</p><p>Abstract: Identifying domain-dependent opinion words is a key problem in opinion mining and has been studied by several researchers. However, existing work has been focused on adjectives and to some extent verbs. Limited work has been done on nouns and noun phrases. In our work, we used the feature-based opinion mining model, and we found that in some domains nouns and noun phrases that indicate product features may also imply opinions. In many such cases, these nouns are not subjective but objective. Their involved sentences are also objective sentences and imply positive or negative opinions. Identifying such nouns and noun phrases and their polarities is very challenging but critical for effective opinion mining in these domains. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been studied in the literature. This paper proposes a method to deal with the problem. Experimental results based on real-life datasets show promising results. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.77758551 <a title="132-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Extracting_Paraphrases_from_Definition_Sentences_on_the_Web.html">132 acl-2011-Extracting Paraphrases from Definition Sentences on the Web</a></p>

<p>Author: Dipanjan Das ; Slav Petrov</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel approach for inducing unsupervised part-of-speech taggers for languages that have no labeled training data, but have translated text in a resource-rich language. Our method does not assume any knowledge about the target language (in particular no tagging dictionary is assumed), making it applicable to a wide array of resource-poor languages. We use graph-based label propagation for cross-lingual knowledge transfer and use the projected labels as features in an unsupervised model (BergKirkpatrick et al., 2010). Across eight European languages, our approach results in an average absolute improvement of 10.4% over a state-of-the-art baseline, and 16.7% over vanilla hidden Markov models induced with the Expectation Maximization algorithm.</p><p>4 0.714993 <a title="132-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Chinese_sentence_segmentation_as_comma_classification.html">66 acl-2011-Chinese sentence segmentation as comma classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Qin Gao ; Stephan Vogel</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach of expanding parallel corpora for machine translation. By utilizing Semantic role labeling (SRL) on one side of the language pair, we extract SRL substitution rules from existing parallel corpus. The rules are then used for generating new sentence pairs. An SVM classifier is built to filter the generated sentence pairs. The filtered corpus is used for training phrase-based translation models, which can be used directly in translation tasks or combined with baseline models. Experimental results on ChineseEnglish machine translation tasks show an average improvement of 0.45 BLEU and 1.22 TER points across 5 different NIST test sets.</p><p>6 0.63354707 <a title="132-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Monolingual_Alignment_by_Edit_Rate_Computation_on_Sentential_Paraphrase_Pairs.html">225 acl-2011-Monolingual Alignment by Edit Rate Computation on Sentential Paraphrase Pairs</a></p>

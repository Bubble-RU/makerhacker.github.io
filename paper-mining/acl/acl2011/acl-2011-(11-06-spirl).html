<p>Author: Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi ; Hal Daume III ; Raghavendra Udupa</p><p>Abstract: Mapping documents into an interlingual representation can help bridge the language barrier of a cross-lingual corpus. Previous approaches use aligned documents as training data to learn an interlingual representation, making them sensitive to the domain of the training data. In this paper, we learn an interlingual representation in an unsupervised manner using only a bilingual dictionary. We first use the bilingual dictionary to find candidate document alignments and then use them to find an interlingual representation. Since the candidate alignments are noisy, we de- velop a robust learning algorithm to learn the interlingual representation. We show that bilingual dictionaries generalize to different domains better: our approach gives better performance than either a word by word translation method or Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) trained on a different domain.</p><p>3 0.079816714 <a title="1-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Domain_Adaptation_for_Machine_Translation_by_Mining_Unseen_Words.html">104 acl-2011-Domain Adaptation for Machine Translation by Mining Unseen Words</a></p>
<p>Author: Hal Daume III ; Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi</p><p>Abstract: We show that unseen words account for a large part of the translation error when moving to new domains. Using an extension of a recent approach to mining translations from comparable corpora (Haghighi et al., 2008), we are able to find translations for otherwise OOV terms. We show several approaches to integrating such translations into a phrasebased translation system, yielding consistent improvements in translations quality (between 0.5 and 1.5 Bleu points) on four domains and two language pairs.</p><p>4 0.052023266 <a title="1-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-P11-2093_k2opt.pdf.html">238 acl-2011-P11-2093 k2opt.pdf</a></p>
<p>Author: empty-author</p><p>Abstract: We present a pointwise approach to Japanese morphological analysis (MA) that ignores structure information during learning and tagging. Despite the lack of structure, it is able to outperform the current state-of-the-art structured approach for Japanese MA, and achieves accuracy similar to that of structured predictors using the same feature set. We also find that the method is both robust to outof-domain data, and can be easily adapted through the use of a combination of partial annotation and active learning.</p><p>5 0.051112123 <a title="1-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Integrating_surprisal_and_uncertain-input_models_in_online_sentence_comprehension%3A_formal_techniques_and_empirical_results.html">176 acl-2011-Integrating surprisal and uncertain-input models in online sentence comprehension: formal techniques and empirical results</a></p>
<p>Author: Roger Levy</p><p>Abstract: A system making optimal use of available information in incremental language comprehension might be expected to use linguistic knowledge together with current input to revise beliefs about previous input. Under some circumstances, such an error-correction capability might induce comprehenders to adopt grammatical analyses that are inconsistent with the true input. Here we present a formal model of how such input-unfaithful garden paths may be adopted and the difficulty incurred by their subsequent disconfirmation, combining a rational noisy-channel model of syntactic comprehension under uncertain input with the surprisal theory of incremental processing difficulty. We also present a behavioral experiment confirming the key empirical predictions of the theory.</p><p>6 0.045506828 <a title="1-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Exploiting_Web-Derived_Selectional_Preference_to_Improve_Statistical_Dependency_Parsing.html">127 acl-2011-Exploiting Web-Derived Selectional Preference to Improve Statistical Dependency Parsing</a></p>

<p>Author: Aaron Michelony</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of predicting which words a student will click in a vocabulary learning system. Often a language learner will find value in the ability to look up the meaning of an unknown word while reading an electronic document by clicking the word. Highlighting words likely to be unknown to a readeris attractive due to drawing his orher attention to it and indicating that information is available. However, this option is usually done manually in vocabulary systems and online encyclopedias such as Wikipedia. Furthurmore, it is never on a per-user basis. This paper presents an automated way of highlighting words likely to be unknown to the specific user. We present related work in search engine ranking, a description of the study used to collect click data, the experiment we performed using the random forest machine learning algorithm and finish with a discussion of future work.</p><p>4 0.36419252 <a title="1-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Effective_Measures_of_Domain_Similarity_for_Parsing.html">109 acl-2011-Effective Measures of Domain Similarity for Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Barbara Plank ; Gertjan van Noord</p><p>Abstract: It is well known that parsing accuracy suffers when a model is applied to out-of-domain data. It is also known that the most beneficial data to parse a given domain is data that matches the domain (Sekine, 1997; Gildea, 2001). Hence, an important task is to select appropriate domains. However, most previous work on domain adaptation relied on the implicit assumption that domains are somehow given. As more and more data becomes available, automatic ways to select data that is beneficial for a new (unknown) target domain are becoming attractive. This paper evaluates various ways to automatically acquire related training data for a given test set. The results show that an unsupervised technique based on topic models is effective – it outperforms random data selection on both languages exam- ined, English and Dutch. Moreover, the technique works better than manually assigned labels gathered from meta-data that is available for English. 1 Introduction and Motivation Previous research on domain adaptation has focused on the task of adapting a system trained on one domain, say newspaper text, to a particular new domain, say biomedical data. Usually, some amount of (labeled or unlabeled) data from the new domain was given which has been determined by a human. However, with the growth of the web, more and more data is becoming available, where each document “is potentially its own domain” (McClosky et al., 2010). It is not straightforward to determine – 1566 Gertjan van Noord University of Groningen The Netherlands G J M van Noord@ rug nl . . . . . which data or model (in case we have several source domain models) will perform best on a new (unknown) target domain. Therefore, an important issue that arises is how to measure domain similarity, i.e. whether we can find a simple yet effective method to determine which model or data is most beneficial for an arbitrary piece of new text. Moreover, if we had such a measure, a related question is whether it can tell us something more about what is actually meant by “domain”. So far, it was mostly arbitrarily used to refer to some kind of coherent unit (related to topic, style or genre), e.g.: newspaper text, biomedical abstracts, questions, fiction. Most previous work on domain adaptation, for instance Hara et al. (2005), McClosky et al. (2006), Blitzer et al. (2006), Daum e´ III (2007), sidestepped this problem of automatic domain selection and adaptation. For parsing, to our knowledge only one recent study has started to examine this issue (McClosky et al., 2010) we will discuss their approach in Section 2. Rather, an implicit assumption of all of these studies is that domains are given, i.e. that they are represented by the respective corpora. Thus, a corpus has been considered a homogeneous unit. As more data is becoming available, it is unlikely that – domains will be ‘given’ . Moreover, a given corpus might not always be as homogeneous as originally thought (Webber, 2009; Lippincott et al., 2010). For instance, recent work has shown that the well-known Penn Treebank (PT) Wall Street Journal (WSJ) actually contains a variety of genres, including letters, wit and short verse (Webber, 2009). In this study we take a different approach. Rather than viewing a given corpus as a monolithic entity, ProceedingPso orftla thned 4,9 Otrhe Agonnn,u Jauln Mee 1e9t-i2ng4, o 2f0 t1h1e. A ?c s 2o0ci1a1ti Aonss foocria Ctioomnp fourta Ctioomnaplu Ltaintigouniaslti Lcisn,g puaigsetsic 1s566–1576, we break it down to the article-level and disregard corpora boundaries. Given the resulting set of documents (articles), we evaluate various ways to automatically acquire related training data for a given test set, to find answers to the following questions: • Given a pool of data (a collection of articles fGriovmen nun ak pnooowln o domains) caonldle a test article, eiss there a way to automatically select data that is relevant for the new domain? If so: • Which similarity measure is good for parsing? • How does it compare to human-annotated data? • Is the measure also useful for other languages Iasnd th/oer mtaesakssu?r To this end, we evaluate measures of domain similarity and feature representations and their impact on dependency parsing accuracy. Given a collection of annotated articles, and a new article that we want to parse, we want to select the most similar articles to train the best parser for that new article. In the following, we will first compare automatic measures to human-annotated labels by examining parsing performance within subdomains of the Penn Treebank WSJ. Then, we extend the experiments to the domain adaptation scenario. Experiments were performed on two languages: English and Dutch. The empirical results show that a simple measure based on topic distributions is effective for both languages and works well also for Part-of-Speech tagging. As the approach is based on plain surfacelevel information (words) and it finds related data in a completely unsupervised fashion, it can be easily applied to other tasks or languages for which annotated (or automatically annotated) data is available. 2 Related Work The work most related to ours is McClosky et al. (2010). They try to find the best combination of source models to parse data from a new domain, which is related to Plank and Sima’an (2008). In the latter, unlabeled data was used to create several parsers by weighting trees in the WSJ according to their similarity to the subdomain. McClosky et al. (2010) coined the term multiple source domain adaptation. Inspired by work on parsing accuracy 1567 prediction (Ravi et al., 2008), they train a linear regression model to predict the best (linear interpolation) of source domain models. Similar to us, McClosky et al. (2010) regard a target domain as mixture of source domains, but they focus on phrasestructure parsing. Furthermore, our approach differs from theirs in two respects: we do not treat source corpora as one entity and try to mix models, but rather consider articles as base units and try to find subsets of related articles (the most similar articles); moreover, instead of creating a supervised model (in their case to predict parsing accuracy), our approach is ‘simplistic’ : we apply measures of domain simi- larity directly (in an unsupervised fashion), without the necessity to train a supervised model. Two other related studies are (Lippincott et al., 2010; Van Asch and Daelemans, 2010). Van Asch and Daelemans (2010) explore a measure of domain difference (Renyi divergence) between pairs of domains and its correlation to Part-of-Speech tagging accuracy. Their empirical results show a linear correlation between the measure and the performance loss. Their goal is different, but related: rather than finding related data for a new domain, they want to estimate the loss in accuracy of a PoS tagger when applied to a new domain. We will briefly discuss results obtained with the Renyi divergence in Section 5.1. Lippincott et al. (2010) examine subdomain variation in biomedicine corpora and propose awareness of NLP tools to such variation. However, they did not yet evaluate the effect on a practical task, thus our study is somewhat complementary to theirs. The issue of data selection has recently been examined for Language Modeling (Moore and Lewis, 2010). A subset of the available data is automatically selected as training data for a Language Model based on a scoring mechanism that compares cross- entropy scores. Their approach considerably outperformed random selection and two previous proposed approaches both based on perplexity scoring.1 3 Measures of Domain Similarity 3.1 Measuring Similarity Automatically Feature Representations A similarity function may be defined over any set of events that are con1We tested data selection by perplexity scoring, but found the Language Models too small to be useful in our setting. sidered to be relevant for the task at hand. For parsing, these might be words, characters, n-grams (of words or characters), Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags, bilexical dependencies, syntactic rules, etc. However, to obtain more abstract types such as PoS tags or dependency relations, one would first need to gather respective labels. The necessary tools for this are again trained on particular corpora, and will suffer from domain shifts, rendering labels noisy. Therefore, we want to gauge the effect of the simplest representation possible: plain surface characteristics (unlabeled text). This has the advantage that we do not need to rely on additional supervised tools; moreover, it is interesting to know how far we can get with this level of information only. We examine the following feature representations: relative frequencies of words, relative frequencies of character tetragrams, and topic models. Our motivation was as follows. Relative frequencies of words are a simple and effective representation used e.g. in text classification (Manning and Sch u¨tze, 1999), while character n-grams have proven successful in genre classification (Wu et al., 2010). Topic models (Blei et al., 2003; Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007) can be considered an advanced model over word distributions: every article is represented by a topic distribution, which in turn is a distribution over words. Similarity between documents can be measured by comparing topic distributions. Similarity Functions There are many possible similarity (or distance) functions. They fall broadly into two categories: probabilistically-motivated and geometrically-motivated functions. The similarity functions examined in this study will be described in the following. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence D(q| |r) is a cTlahsesic Kaull measure oibfl ‘edri s(KtaLn)ce d’i2v ebregtweneceen D Dtw(oq probability distributions, and is defined as: D(q| |r) = Pyq(y)logrq((yy)). It is a non-negative, additive, aPsymmetric measure, and 0 iff the two distributions are identical. However, the KL-divergence is undefined if there exists an event y such that q(y) > 0 but r(y) = 0, which is a property that “makes it unsuitable for distributions derived via maximumlikelihood estimates” (Lee, 2001). 2It is not a proper distance metric since it is asymmetric. 1568 One option to overcome this limitation is to apply smoothing techniques to gather non-zero estimates for all y. The alternative, examined in this paper, is to consider an approximation to the KL divergence, such as the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence (Lin, 1991) and the skew divergence (Lee, 2001). The Jensen-Shannon divergence, which is symmetric, computes the KL-divergence between q, r, and the average between the two. We use the JS divergence as defined in Lee (2001): JS(q, r) = [D(q| |avg(q, r)) + D(r| |avg(q, r))] . The asymm[eDtr(icq |s|akvewg( divergence sα, proposed by Lee (2001), mixes one distribution with the other by a degree de- 21 fined by α ∈ [0, 1) : sα (q, r, α) = D(q| |αr + (1 α)q). Ays α α approaches 1, rt,hαe )sk =ew D divergence approximates the KL-divergence. An alternative way to measure similarity is to consider the distributions as vectors and apply geometrically-motivated distance functions. This family of similarity functions includes the cosine cos(q, r) = qq(y) · r(y)/ | |q(y) | | | |r(y) | |, euclidean − euc(q,r) = qPy(q(y) − r(y))2 and variational (also known asq LP1 or MPanhattan) distance function, defined as var(q, r) = Py |q(y) − r(y) |. 3.2 Human-annotatePd data In contrast to the automatic measures devised in the previous section, we might have access to human annotated data. That is, use label information such as topic or genre to define the set of similar articles. Genre For the Penn Treebank (PT) Wall Street Journal (WSJ) section, more specifically, the subset available in the Penn Discourse Treebank, there exists a partition of the data by genre (Webber, 2009). Every article is assigned one of the following genre labels: news, letters, highlights, essays, errata, wit and short verse, quarterly progress reports, notable and quotable. This classification has been made on the basis of meta-data (Webber, 2009). It is wellknown that there is no meta-data directly associated with the individual WSJ files in the Penn Treebank. However, meta-data can be obtained by looking at the articles in the ACL/DCI corpus (LDC99T42), and a mapping file that aligns document numbers of DCI (DOCNO) to WSJ keys (Webber, 2009). An example document is given in Figure 1. The metadata field HL contains headlines, SO source info, and the IN field includes topic markers.</p><p>5 0.36137795 <a title="1-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Clustering_Comparable_Corpora_For_Bilingual_Lexicon_Extraction.html">70 acl-2011-Clustering Comparable Corpora For Bilingual Lexicon Extraction</a></p>

We introduce a clustering-based approach for enhancing corpus comparability which exploits the homogeneity feature of the corpus, and finally preserves most of the vocabulary of the original corpus. Our experiments illustrate the well-foundedness of this method and show that the bilingual lexicons obtained from the homogeneous corpus are of better quality than the lexicons obtained with previous approaches.</p><p>6 0.34302548 <a title="1-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Local_Histograms_of_Character_N-grams_for_Authorship_Attribution.html">212 acl-2011-Local Histograms of Character N-grams for Authorship Attribution</a></p>

<p>Author: Aditya Bhargava ; Grzegorz Kondrak</p><p>Abstract: Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P) of names is an important and challenging problem. The correct pronunciation of a name is often reflected in its transliterations, which are expressed within a different phonological inventory. We investigate the problem of using transliterations to correct errors produced by state-of-the-art G2P systems. We present a novel re-ranking approach that incorporates a variety of score and n-gram features, in order to leverage transliterations from multiple languages. Our experiments demonstrate significant accuracy improvements when re-ranking is applied to n-best lists generated by three different G2P programs.</p><p>3 0.11045999 <a title="1-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Event_Extraction_as_Dependency_Parsing.html">122 acl-2011-Event Extraction as Dependency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: David McClosky ; Mihai Surdeanu ; Christopher Manning</p><p>Abstract: Nested event structures are a common occurrence in both open domain and domain specific extraction tasks, e.g., a “crime” event can cause a “investigation” event, which can lead to an “arrest” event. However, most current approaches address event extraction with highly local models that extract each event and argument independently. We propose a simple approach for the extraction of such structures by taking the tree of event-argument relations and using it directly as the representation in a reranking dependency parser. This provides a simple framework that captures global properties of both nested and flat event structures. We explore a rich feature space that models both the events to be parsed and context from the original supporting text. Our approach obtains competitive results in the extraction of biomedical events from the BioNLP’09 shared task with a F1 score of 53.5% in development and 48.6% in testing.</p><p>4 0.097373255 <a title="1-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-An_Empirical_Evaluation_of_Data-Driven_Paraphrase_Generation_Techniques.html">37 acl-2011-An Empirical Evaluation of Data-Driven Paraphrase Generation Techniques</a></p>
<p>Author: Donald Metzler ; Eduard Hovy ; Chunliang Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Paraphrase generation is an important task that has received a great deal of interest recently. Proposed data-driven solutions to the problem have ranged from simple approaches that make minimal use of NLP tools to more complex approaches that rely on numerous language-dependent resources. Despite all of the attention, there have been very few direct empirical evaluations comparing the merits of the different approaches. This paper empirically examines the tradeoffs between simple and sophisticated paraphrase harvesting approaches to help shed light on their strengths and weaknesses. Our evaluation reveals that very simple approaches fare surprisingly well and have a number of distinct advantages, including strong precision, good coverage, and low redundancy.</p><p>5 0.0 <a title="1-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-AM-FM%3A_A_Semantic_Framework_for_Translation_Quality_Assessment.html">2 acl-2011-AM-FM: A Semantic Framework for Translation Quality Assessment</a></p>
<p>Author: Rafael E. Banchs ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: This work introduces AM-FM, a semantic framework for machine translation evaluation. Based upon this framework, a new evaluation metric, which is able to operate without the need for reference translations, is implemented and evaluated. The metric is based on the concepts of adequacy and fluency, which are independently assessed by using a cross-language latent semantic indexing approach and an n-gram based language model approach, respectively. Comparative analyses with conventional evaluation metrics are conducted on two different evaluation tasks (overall quality assessment and comparative ranking) over a large collection of human evaluations involving five European languages. Finally, the main pros and cons of the proposed framework are discussed along with future research directions. 1</p><p>6 0.0 <a title="1-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-A_Bayesian_Model_for_Unsupervised_Semantic_Parsing.html">3 acl-2011-A Bayesian Model for Unsupervised Semantic Parsing</a></p>

<p>Author: Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: In citation-based summarization, text written by several researchers is leveraged to identify the important aspects of a target paper. Previous work on this problem focused almost exclusively on its extraction aspect (i.e. selecting a representative set of citation sentences that highlight the contribution of the target paper). Meanwhile, the fluency of the produced summaries has been mostly ignored. For example, diversity, readability, cohesion, and ordering of the sentences included in the summary have not been thoroughly considered. This resulted in noisy and confusing summaries. In this work, we present an approach for producing readable and cohesive citation-based summaries. Our experiments show that the pro- posed approach outperforms several baselines in terms of both extraction quality and fluency.</p><p>3 0.42579827 <a title="281-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Collective_Classification_of_Congressional_Floor-Debate_Transcripts.html">73 acl-2011-Collective Classification of Congressional Floor-Debate Transcripts</a></p>
<p>Author: Clinton Burfoot ; Steven Bird ; Timothy Baldwin</p><p>Abstract: This paper explores approaches to sentiment classification of U.S. Congressional floordebate transcripts. Collective classification techniques are used to take advantage of the informal citation structure present in the debates. We use a range of methods based on local and global formulations and introduce novel approaches for incorporating the outputs of machine learners into collective classification algorithms. Our experimental evaluation shows that the mean-field algorithm obtains the best results for the task, significantly outperforming the benchmark technique.</p><p>4 0.37789744 <a title="281-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Learning_Word_Vectors_for_Sentiment_Analysis.html">204 acl-2011-Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew L. Maas ; Raymond E. Daly ; Peter T. Pham ; Dan Huang ; Andrew Y. Ng ; Christopher Potts</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised vector-based approaches to semantics can model rich lexical meanings, but they largely fail to capture sentiment information that is central to many word meanings and important for a wide range of NLP tasks. We present a model that uses a mix of unsupervised and supervised techniques to learn word vectors capturing semantictermâ€“documentinformation as well as rich sentiment content. The proposed model can leverage both continuous and multi-dimensional sentiment information as well as non-sentiment annotations. We instantiate the model to utilize the document-level sentiment polarity annotations present in many online documents (e.g. star ratings). We evaluate the model using small, widely used sentiment and subjectivity corpora and find it out-performs several previously introduced methods for sentiment classification. We also introduce a large dataset , of movie reviews to serve as a more robust benchmark for work in this area.</p><p>5 0.37618271 <a title="281-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Using_Multiple_Sources_to_Construct_a_Sentiment_Sensitive_Thesaurus_for_Cross-Domain_Sentiment_Classification.html">332 acl-2011-Using Multiple Sources to Construct a Sentiment Sensitive Thesaurus for Cross-Domain Sentiment Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Danushka Bollegala ; David Weir ; John Carroll</p><p>Abstract: We describe a sentiment classification method that is applicable when we do not have any labeled data for a target domain but have some labeled data for multiple other domains, designated as the source domains. We automat- ically create a sentiment sensitive thesaurus using both labeled and unlabeled data from multiple source domains to find the association between words that express similar sentiments in different domains. The created thesaurus is then used to expand feature vectors to train a binary classifier. Unlike previous cross-domain sentiment classification methods, our method can efficiently learn from multiple source domains. Our method significantly outperforms numerous baselines and returns results that are better than or comparable to previous cross-domain sentiment classification methods on a benchmark dataset containing Amazon user reviews for different types of products.</p><p>6 0.35261226 <a title="281-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-PsychoSentiWordNet.html">253 acl-2011-PsychoSentiWordNet</a></p>

<p>Author: Amitava Das</p><p>Abstract: Sentiment analysis is one of the hot demanding research areas since last few decades. Although a formidable amount of research has been done but still the existing reported solutions or available systems are far from perfect or to meet the satisfaction level of end user's. The main issue may be there are many conceptual rules that govern sentiment, and there are even more clues (possibly unlimited) that can convey these concepts from realization to verbalization of a human being. Human psychology directly relates to the unrevealed clues; govern the sentiment realization of us. Human psychology relates many things like social psychology, culture, pragmatics and many more endless intelligent aspects of civilization. Proper incorporation of human psychology into computational sentiment knowledge representation may solve the problem. PsychoSentiWordNet is an extension over SentiWordNet that holds human psychological knowledge and sentiment knowledge simultaneously. 1</p><p>6 0.58187038 <a title="281-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Semi-supervised_latent_variable_models_for_sentence-level_sentiment_analysis.html">279 acl-2011-Semi-supervised latent variable models for sentence-level sentiment analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Nitin Agarwal ; Ravi Shankar Reddy ; Kiran GVR ; Carolyn Penstein Rose</p><p>Abstract: In this demo, we present SciSumm, an interactive multi-document summarization system for scientific articles. The document collection to be summarized is a list of papers cited together within the same source article, otherwise known as a co-citation. At the heart of the approach is a topic based clustering of fragments extracted from each article based on queries generated from the context surrounding the co-cited list of papers. This analysis enables the generation of an overview of common themes from the co-cited papers that relate to the context in which the co-citation was found. SciSumm is currently built over the 2008 ACL Anthology, however the gen- eralizable nature of the summarization techniques and the extensible architecture makes it possible to use the system with other corpora where a citation network is available. Evaluation results on the same corpus demonstrate that our system performs better than an existing widely used multi-document summarization system (MEAD).</p><p>2 0.7467615 <a title="281-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Towards_Style_Transformation_from_Written-Style_to_Audio-Style.html">306 acl-2011-Towards Style Transformation from Written-Style to Audio-Style</a></p>
<p>Author: Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Barbara Rosario ; Kent Lyons</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of optimizing the style of textual content to make it more suitable to being listened to by a user as opposed to being read. We study the differences between the written style and the audio style by consulting the linguistics andjour- nalism literatures. Guided by this study, we suggest a number of linguistic features to distinguish between the two styles. We show the correctness of our features and the impact of style transformation on the user experience through statistical analysis, a style classification task, and a user study.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.72651988 <a title="281-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Sentiment_Analysis_of_Citations_using_Sentence_Structure-Based_Features.html">281 acl-2011-Sentiment Analysis of Citations using Sentence Structure-Based Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthew R. Scott ; Xiaohua Liu ; Ming Zhou ; Microsoft Engkoo Team</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents Engkoo 1, a system for exploring and learning language. It is built primarily by mining translation knowledge from billions of web pages - using the Internet to catch language in motion. Currently Engkoo is built for Chinese users who are learning English; however the technology itself is language independent and can be extended in the future. At a system level, Engkoo is an application platform that supports a multitude of NLP technologies such as cross language retrieval, alignment, sentence classification, and statistical machine translation. The data set that supports this system is primarily built from mining a massive set of bilingual terms and sentences from across the web. Specifically, web pages that contain both Chinese and English are discovered and analyzed for parallelism, extracted and formulated into clear term definitions and sample sentences. This approach allows us to build perhaps the worldâ€™s largest lexicon linking both Chinese and English together - at the same time covering the most up-to-date terms as captured by the net.</p><p>5 0.60734659 <a title="281-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Unsupervised_Part-of-Speech_Tagging_with_Bilingual_Graph-Based_Projections.html">323 acl-2011-Unsupervised Part-of-Speech Tagging with Bilingual Graph-Based Projections</a></p>
<p>Author: Dipanjan Das ; Slav Petrov</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel approach for inducing unsupervised part-of-speech taggers for languages that have no labeled training data, but have translated text in a resource-rich language. Our method does not assume any knowledge about the target language (in particular no tagging dictionary is assumed), making it applicable to a wide array of resource-poor languages. We use graph-based label propagation for cross-lingual knowledge transfer and use the projected labels as features in an unsupervised model (BergKirkpatrick et al., 2010). Across eight European languages, our approach results in an average absolute improvement of 10.4% over a state-of-the-art baseline, and 16.7% over vanilla hidden Markov models induced with the Expectation Maximization algorithm.</p><p>6 0.59330159 <a title="281-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-MemeTube%3A_A_Sentiment-based_Audiovisual_System_for_Analyzing_and_Displaying_Microblog_Messages.html">218 acl-2011-MemeTube: A Sentiment-based Audiovisual System for Analyzing and Displaying Microblog Messages</a></p>

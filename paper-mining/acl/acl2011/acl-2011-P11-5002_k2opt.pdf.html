<p>Author: Renxian Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In summarization, sentence ordering is conducted to enhance summary readability by accommodating text coherence. We propose a grouping-based ordering framework that integrates local and global coherence concerns. Summary sentences are grouped before ordering is applied on two levels: group-level and sentence-level. Different algorithms for grouping and ordering are discussed. The preliminary results on single-document news datasets demonstrate the advantage of our method over a widely accepted method. 1 Introduction and Background The canonical pipeline of text summarization consists of topic identification, interpretation, and summary generation (Hovy, 2005). In the simple case of extraction, topic identification and interpretation are conflated to sentence selection and concerned with summary informativeness. In . comparison, summary generation addresses summary readability and a frequently discussed generation technique is sentence ordering. It is implicitly or explicitly stated that sentence ordering for summarization is primarily driven by coherence. For example, Barzilay et al. (2002) use lexical cohesion information to model local coherence. A statistical model by Lapata (2003) considers both lexical and syntactic features in calculating local coherence. More globally biased is Barzilay and Lee’s (2004) HMM-based content model, which models global coherence with word distribution patterns. Whilst the above models treat coherence as lexical or topical relations, Barzilay and Lapata (2005, 2008) explicitly model local coherence with an entity grid model trained for optimal syntactic role transitions of entities. 6 . polyu .edu .hk Although coherence in those works is modeled in the guise of “lexical cohesion”, “topic closeness”, “content relatedness”, etc., few published works simultaneously accommodate coherence on the two levels: local coherence and global coherence, both of which are intriguing topics in text linguistics and psychology. For sentences, local coherence means the wellconnectedness between adjacent sentences through lexical cohesion (Halliday and Hasan, 1976) or entity repetition (Grosz et al., 1995) and global coherence is the discourse-level relation connecting remote sentences (Mann and Thompson, 1995; Kehler, 2002). An abundance of psychological evidences show that coherence on both levels is manifested in text comprehension (Tapiero, 2007). Accordingly, an apt sentence ordering scheme should be driven by such concerns. We also note that as sentence ordering is usually discussed only in the context of multi-document summarization, factors other than coherence are also considered, such as time and source sentence position in Bollegala et al.’s (2006) “agglomerative ordering” approach. But it remains an open question whether sentence ordering is non-trivial for single-document summarization, as it has long been recognized as an actual strategy taken by human summarizers (Jing, 1998; Jing and McKeown, 2000) and acknowledged early in work on sentence ordering for multi-document summarization (Barzilay et al., 2002). In this paper, we outline a grouping-based sentence ordering framework that is driven by the concern of local and global coherence. Summary sentences are grouped according to their conceptual relatedness before being ordered on two levels: group-level ordering and sentence-level ordering, which capture global coherence and local coherence in an integrated model. As a preliminary study, we applied the framework to singlePortland, ORP,r UoSceAed 1i9ng-2s4 of Ju tnhee 2 A0C1L1-H. ?Lc T2 0201111 A Ssstuodcieanttio Snes fsoiro Cn,o pmapguesta 6t–io1n1a,l Linguistics document summary generation and obtained interesting results. The main contributions of this work are: (1) we stress the need to channel sentence ordering research to linguistic and psychological findings about text coherence; (2) we propose a groupingbased ordering framework that integrates both local and global coherence; (3) we find in experiments that coherence-driven sentence ordering improves the readability of singledocument summaries, for which sentence ordering is often considered trivial. In Section 2, we review related ideas and techniques in previous work. Section 3 provides the details of grouping-based sentence ordering. The preliminary experimental results are presented in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes the whole paper and describes future work. 2 Grouping-Based Ordering Our ordering framework is designed to capture both local and global coherence. Globally, we identify related groups among sentences and find their relative order. Locally, we strive to keep sentence similar or related in content close to each other within one group. 2.1 Sentence Representation As summary sentences are isolated from their original context, we retain the important content information by representing sentences as concept vectors. In the simplest case, the “concept” is equivalent to content word. A drawback of this practice is that it considers every content word equally contributive to the sentence content, which is not always true. For example, in the news domain, entities realized as NPs are more important than other concepts. To represent sentences as entity vectors, we identify both common entities (as the head nouns of NPs) and named entities. Two common entities are equivalent if their noun stems are identical or synonymous. Named entities are usually equated by identity. But in order to improve accuracy, we also consider: 1) structural subsumption (one is part of another); 2) hypernymy and holonymy (the named entities are in a superordinate-subordinate or part-whole relation). Now with summary sentence Si and m entities eik (k = 1 m), Si = (wf(ei1), wf(ei2), wf(eim)), … … … … … …, 7 where wf(eik) = wk× ×f(eik), f(eik) is the frequency of eik and wk is the weight of eik. We define wk = 1 if eik is a common entity and wk = 2 if eik is a named entity. We give double weight to named entities because of their significance to news articles. After all, a news story typically contains events, places, organizations, people, etc. that denote the news theme. Other things being equal, two sentences sharing a mention of named entities are thematically closer than two sentences sharing a mention of common entities. Alternatively, we can realize the “concept” as “event” because events are prevalent semantic constructs that bear much of the sentence content in some domains (e.g., narratives and news reports). To represent sentences as event vectors, we can follow Zhang et al.’s (2010) method at the cost of more complexity. 2.2 Sentence Grouping To meet the global need of identifying sentence groups, we develop two grouping algorithms by applying graph-based operation and clustering. Connected Component Finding (CC) This algorithm treats grouping sentences as finding connected components (CC) in a text graph TG = (V, E), where V represents the sentences and E the sentence relations weighted by cosine similarity. Edges with weight < t, a threshold, are removed because they represent poor sentence coherence. The resultant graph may be disconnected, in which we find all of its connected components, using depth-first search. The connected components are the groups we are looking for. Note that this method cannot guarantee that every two sentences in such a group are directly linked, but it does guarantee that there exists a path between every sentence pair. Modified K-means Clustering (MKM) Observing that the CC method finds only coherent groups, not necessarily groups of coherent sentences, we develop a second algorithm using clustering. A good choice might be K-means as it is efficient and outperforms agglomerative clustering methods in NLP applications (Steibach et al., 2000), but the difficulty with the conventional K-means is the decision of K. Our solution is modified K-means (MKM) based on (Wilpon and Rabiner, 1985). Let’s denote cluster iby CLi and cluster similarity by Sim(CLi) =SimM,SiinnCLi(Sim( Sim,Sin)), where Sim( Sim,Sin)is their cvMeluin231st.(roCWSD21imLsdhtoIf(=ClaSehbLsimt)l1;(zehS<-amncs,tdoeSa1vn)c;st:el=uMionvrate(lhcSKiosmg-tC;eblLayn)s,c2riuegant wcoelsunathdi cosine. The following illustrates the algorithm. The above algorithm stops iterating when each cluster contains all above-threshold-similarity sentence pairs or only one sentence. Unlike CC, MKM results in more strongly connected groups, or groups of coherence sentences. 2.3 Ordering Algorithms After the sentences are grouped, ordering is to be conducted on two levels: group and sentence. Composed of closely related sentences, groups simulate high-level textual constructs, such as “central event”, “cause”, “effect”, “background”, etc. for news articles, around which sentences are generated for global coherence. For an intuitive example, all sentences about “cause” should immediately precede all sentences about “effect” to achieve optimal readability. We propose two approaches to group-level ordering. 1) If the group sentences come from the same document, group (Gi) order is decided by the group-representing sentence (gi) order ( means “precede”) in the text. gi gj  Gi Gj 2) Group order is decided in a greedy fashion in order to maximize the connectedness between adjacent groups, thus enhancing local coherence. Each time a group is selected to achieve maximum similarity with the ordered groups and the first ordered group (G1) is selected to achieve maximum similarity with all the other groups. G1argmGaxG'GSim( G , G') GiGuanrogrdemred agrxoupsij1 Sim( Gj, G) (i > 1) where Sim(G, G’) is the average sentence cosine similarity between G and G’. 8 Within the ordered groups, sentence-level ordering is aimed to enhance local coherence by placing conceptually close sentences next to each other. Similarly, we propose two approaches. 1) If the sentences come from the same document, they are arranged by the text order. 2) Sentence order is greedily decided. Similar to the decision of group order, with ordered sentence Spi in group Gp: Sp1argSm GpaxS'SSim( S , S') SpiSunorader egd smenteanxces in Gpji1 Sim( Spj,S )(i > 1) Note that the text order is used as a common heuristic, based on the assumption that the sentences are arranged coherently in the source document, locally and globally. 3 Experiments and Preliminary Results Currently, we have evaluated grouping-based ordering on single-document summarization, for which text order is usually considered sufficient. But there is no theoretical proof that it leads to optimal global and local coherence that concerns us. On some occasions, e.g., a news article adopting the “Wall Street Journal Formula” (Rich and Harper, 2007) where conceptually related sentences are placed at the beginning and the end, sentence conceptual relatedness does not necessarily correlate with spatial proximity and thus selected sentences may need to be rearranged for better readability. We are not aware of any published work that has empirically compared alternative ways of sentence ordering for singledocument summarization. The experimental results reported below may draw some attention to this taken-for-granted issue. 3.1 Data and Method We prepared 3 datasets of 60 documents each, the first (D400) consisting of documents of about 400 words from the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) 01/02 datasets; the second (D1k) consisting of documents of about 1000 words manually selected from popular English journals such as The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, etc; the third (D2k) consisting of documents of about 2000 words from the DUC 01/02 dataset. Then we generated 100-word summaries for D400 and 200-word summaries for D1k and D2k. Since sentence selection is not our focus, the 180 summaries were all extracts produced by a simple but robust summarizer built on term frequency and sentence position (Aone et al., 1999). Three human annotators were employed to each provide reference orderings for the 180 summaries and mark paragraph (of at least 2 sentences) boundaries, which will be used by one of the evaluation metrics described below. In our implementation of the grouping-based ordering, sentences are represented as entity vectors and the threshold t = Avg( Sim( Sm, Sn))  c , the average sentence similarity in a group multiplied by a coefficient empirically decided on separate held-out datasets of 20 documents for each length category. The “group-representing sentence” is the textually earliest sentence in the group. We experimented with both CC and MKM to generate sentence groups and all the proposed algorithms in 2.3 for group-level and sentence- level orderings, resulting in 8 combinations as test orderings, each coded in the format of “Grouping (CC/MKM) / Group ordering (T/G) / Sentence ordering (T/G)”, where T and G represent the text order approach and the greedy selection approach respectively. For example, “CC/T/G” means grouping with CC, group ordering with text order, and sentence ordering with the greedy approach. We evaluated the test orderings against the 3 reference orderings and compute the average (Madnani et al., 2007) by using 3 different metrics. The first metric is Kendall’s τ (Lapata 2003, 2006), which has been reliably used in ordering evaluations (Bollegala et al., 2006; Madnani et al., 2007). It measures ordering differences in terms of the number of adjacent sentence inversions necessary to convert a test ordering to the reference ordering.   1 4m N( N 1) In this formula, m represents the number of inversions described above and N is the total number of sentences. The second metric is the Average Continuity (AC) proposed by Bollegala et al. (2006), which captures the intuition that the quality of sentence orderings can be estimated by the number of correctly arranged continuous sentences. 9 ACexp(1/(k1) klog(Pn)) n2 In this formula, k is the maximum number of continuous sentences, α is a small value in case Pn = 1. Pn, the proportion of continuous sentences of length n in an ordering, is defined as m/(N – n + 1) where m is the number of continuous sentences of length n in both the test and reference orderings and N is the total number of sentences. Following (Bollegala et al., 2006), we set k = Min(4, N) and α = 0.01. We also go a step further by considering only the continuous sentences in a paragraph marked by human annotators, because paragraphs are local meaning units perceived by human readers and the order of continuous sentences in a paragraph is more strongly grounded than the order of continuous sentences across paragraph boundaries. So in-paragraph sentence continuity is a better estimation for the quality of sentence orderings. This is our third metric: Paragraph-level Average Continuity (P-AC). P-ACexp(1/(k1) klog(PPn )) n2 Here PPn = m ’/(N – n + 1), where m ’ is the number of continuous sentences of length n in both the test ordering and a paragraph of the reference ordering. All the other parameters are as defined in AC and Pn. 3.2 Results The following tables show the results measured by each metric. For comparison, we also include a “Baseline” that uses the text order. For each dataset, two-tailed t-test is conducted between the top scorer and all the other orderings and statistical significance (p < 0.05) is marked with *. In general, our grouping-based ordering scheme outperforms the baseline for news articles of various lengths and statistically significant improvement can be observed on each dataset. This result casts serious doubt on the widely accepted practice of taking the text order for single-document summary generation, which is a major finding from our study. The three evaluation metrics give consistent results although they are based on different observations. The P-AC scores are much lower than their AC counterparts because of its strict paragraph constraint. Interestingly, applying the text order posterior to sentence grouping for group-level and sentence- level ordering leads to consistently optimal performance, as the top scorers on each dataset are almost all “__/T/T”. This suggests that the textual realization of coherence can be sought in the source document if possible, after the selected sentences are rearranged. It is in this sense that the general intuition about the text order is justified. It also suggests that tightly knit paragraphs (groups), where the sentences are closely connected, play a crucial role in creating a coherence flow. Shuffling those paragraphs may not affect the final coherence1. 1 Ithank an anonymous reviewer for pointing this out. 10 The grouping method does make a difference. While CC works best for the short and long datasets (D400 and D2k), MKM is more effective for the medium-sized dataset D1k. Whether the difference is simply due to length or linguistic/stylistic subtleties is an interesting topic for in-depth study. 4 Conclusion and Future Work We have established a grouping-based ordering scheme to accommodate both local and global coherence for summary generation. Experiments on single-document summaries validate our approach and challenge the well accepted text order by the summarization community. Nonetheless, the results do not necessarily propagate to multi-document summarization, for which the same-document clue for ordering cannot apply directly. Adapting the proposed scheme to multi-document summary generation is the ongoing work we are engaged in. In the next step, we will experiment with alternative sentence representations and ordering algorithms to achieve better performance. We are also considering adapting more sophisticated coherence-oriented models, such as (Soricut and Marcu, 2006; Elsner et al., 2007), to our problem so as to make more interesting comparisons possible.

<p>Author: Qixia Jiang ; Maosong Sun</p><p>Abstract: Searching documents that are similar to a query document is an important component in modern information retrieval. Some existing hashing methods can be used for efficient document similarity search. However, unsupervised hashing methods cannot incorporate prior knowledge for better hashing. Although some supervised hashing methods can derive effective hash functions from prior knowledge, they are either computationally expensive or poorly discriminative. This paper proposes a novel (semi-)supervised hashing method named Semi-Supervised SimHash (S3H) for high-dimensional data similarity search. The basic idea of S3H is to learn the optimal feature weights from prior knowledge to relocate the data such that similar data have similar hash codes. We evaluate our method with several state-of-the-art methods on two large datasets. All the results show that our method gets the best performance. 1</p><p>4 0.04904335 <a title="239-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Tier-based_Strictly_Local_Constraints_for_Phonology.html">303 acl-2011-Tier-based Strictly Local Constraints for Phonology</a></p>

This paper defines a class of formal languages, the Tier-based Strictly Local languages, which begin to describe such phenomena. Then this class is located within the Subregular Hierarchy (McNaughton and Papert, 1971). It is found that these languages contain the Strictly Local languages, are star-free, are incomparable with other known sub-star-free classes, and have other interesting properties.</p><p>5 0.041780975 <a title="239-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-EdIt%3A_A_Broad-Coverage_Grammar_Checker_Using_Pattern_Grammar.html">108 acl-2011-EdIt: A Broad-Coverage Grammar Checker Using Pattern Grammar</a></p>
<p>Author: Chung-chi Huang ; Mei-hua Chen ; Shih-ting Huang ; Jason S. Chang</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new method for learning to detect grammatical errors in learner’s writing and provide suggestions. The method involves parsing a reference corpus and inferring grammar patterns in the form of a sequence of content words, function words, and parts-of-speech (e.g., “play ~ role in Ving” and “look forward to Ving”). At runtime, the given passage submitted by the learner is matched using an extended Levenshtein algorithm against the set of pattern rules in order to detect errors and provide suggestions. We present a prototype implementation of the proposed method, EdIt, that can handle a broad range of errors. Promising results are illustrated with three common types of errors in nonnative writing. 1</p><p>6 0.035901453 <a title="239-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Reordering_Constraint_Based_on_Document-Level_Context.html">263 acl-2011-Reordering Constraint Based on Document-Level Context</a></p>

<p>Author: Antske Fokkens</p><p>Abstract: When designing grammars of natural language, typically, more than one formal analysis can account for a given phenomenon. Moreover, because analyses interact, the choices made by the engineer influence the possibilities available in further grammar development. The order in which phenomena are treated may therefore have a major impact on the resulting grammar. This paper proposes to tackle this problem by using metagrammar development as a methodology for grammar engineering. Iargue that metagrammar engineering as an approach facilitates the systematic exploration of grammars through comparison of competing analyses. The idea is illustrated through a comparative study of auxiliary structures in HPSG-based grammars for German and Dutch. Auxiliaries form a central phenomenon of German and Dutch and are likely to influence many components of the grammar. This study shows that a special auxiliary+verb construction significantly improves efficiency compared to the standard argument-composition analysis for both parsing and generation.</p><p>3 0.50171566 <a title="239-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-Tier-based_Strictly_Local_Constraints_for_Phonology.html">303 acl-2011-Tier-based Strictly Local Constraints for Phonology</a></p>
<p>Author: Jeffrey Heinz ; Chetan Rawal ; Herbert G. Tanner</p><p>Abstract: Beginning with Goldsmith (1976), the phonological tier has a long history in phonological theory to describe non-local phenomena. This paper defines a class of formal languages, the Tier-based Strictly Local languages, which begin to describe such phenomena. Then this class is located within the Subregular Hierarchy (McNaughton and Papert, 1971). It is found that these languages contain the Strictly Local languages, are star-free, are incomparable with other known sub-star-free classes, and have other interesting properties.</p><p>4 0.50132608 <a title="239-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Insertion_Operator_for_Bayesian_Tree_Substitution_Grammars.html">173 acl-2011-Insertion Operator for Bayesian Tree Substitution Grammars</a></p>
<p>Author: Hiroyuki Shindo ; Akinori Fujino ; Masaaki Nagata</p><p>Abstract: We propose a model that incorporates an insertion operator in Bayesian tree substitution grammars (BTSG). Tree insertion is helpful for modeling syntax patterns accurately with fewer grammar rules than BTSG. The experimental parsing results show that our model outperforms a standard PCFG and BTSG for a small dataset. For a large dataset, our model obtains comparable results to BTSG, making the number of grammar rules much smaller than with BTSG.</p><p>5 0.49082083 <a title="239-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Efficient_Online_Locality_Sensitive_Hashing_via_Reservoir_Counting.html">113 acl-2011-Efficient Online Locality Sensitive Hashing via Reservoir Counting</a></p>

<p>Author: Oliver Ferschke ; Torsten Zesch ; Iryna Gurevych</p><p>Abstract: We present an open-source toolkit which allows (i) to reconstruct past states of Wikipedia, and (ii) to efficiently access the edit history of Wikipedia articles. Reconstructing past states of Wikipedia is a prerequisite for reproducing previous experimental work based on Wikipedia. Beyond that, the edit history of Wikipedia articles has been shown to be a valuable knowledge source for NLP, but access is severely impeded by the lack of efficient tools for managing the huge amount of provided data. By using a dedicated storage format, our toolkit massively decreases the data volume to less than 2% of the original size, and at the same time provides an easy-to-use interface to access the revision data. The language-independent design allows to process any language represented in Wikipedia. We expect this work to consolidate NLP research using Wikipedia in general, and to foster research making use of the knowledge encoded in Wikipedia’s edit history.</p><p>3 0.4746711 <a title="239-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Insertion_Operator_for_Bayesian_Tree_Substitution_Grammars.html">173 acl-2011-Insertion Operator for Bayesian Tree Substitution Grammars</a></p>

<p>Author: Denis Filimonov ; Mary Harper</p><p>Abstract: In the face of sparsity, statistical models are often interpolated with lower order (backoff) models, particularly in Language Modeling. In this paper, we argue that there is a relation between the higher order and the backoff model that must be satisfied in order for the interpolation to be effective. We show that in n-gram models, the relation is trivially held, but in models that allow arbitrary clustering of context (such as decision tree models), this relation is generally not satisfied. Based on this insight, we also propose a generalization of linear interpolation which significantly improves the performance of a decision tree language model.</p><p>5 0.37098175 <a title="239-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Computing_and_Evaluating_Syntactic_Complexity_Features_for_Automated_Scoring_of_Spontaneous_Non-Native_Speech.html">77 acl-2011-Computing and Evaluating Syntactic Complexity Features for Automated Scoring of Spontaneous Non-Native Speech</a></p>
<p>Author: Miao Chen ; Klaus Zechner</p><p>Abstract: This paper focuses on identifying, extracting and evaluating features related to syntactic complexity of spontaneous spoken responses as part of an effort to expand the current feature set of an automated speech scoring system in order to cover additional aspects considered important in the construct of communicative competence. Our goal is to find effective features, selected from a large set of features proposed previously and some new features designed in analogous ways from a syntactic complexity perspective that correlate well with human ratings of the same spoken responses, and to build automatic scoring models based on the most promising features by using machine learning methods. On human transcriptions with manually annotated clause and sentence boundaries, our best scoring model achieves an overall Pearson correlation with human rater scores of r=0.49 on an unseen test set, whereas correlations of models using sentence or clause boundaries from automated classifiers are around r=0.2. 1</p><p>6 0.36149529 <a title="239-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Reordering_with_Source_Language_Collocations.html">266 acl-2011-Reordering with Source Language Collocations</a></p>

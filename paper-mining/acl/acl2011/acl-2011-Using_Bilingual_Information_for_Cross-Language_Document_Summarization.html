<p>Author: Maoxi Li ; Chengqing Zong ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: Word is usually adopted as the smallest unit in most tasks of Chinese language processing. However, for automatic evaluation of the quality of Chinese translation output when translating from other languages, either a word-level approach or a character-level approach is possible. So far, there has been no detailed study to compare the correlations of these two approaches with human assessment. In this paper, we compare word-level metrics with characterlevel metrics on the submitted output of English-to-Chinese translation systems in the IWSLT’08 CT-EC and NIST’08 EC tasks. Our experimental results reveal that character-level metrics correlate with human assessment better than word-level metrics. Our analysis suggests several key reasons behind this finding. 1</p><p>3 0.15230091 <a title="326-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Joint_Bilingual_Sentiment_Classification_with_Unlabeled_Parallel_Corpora.html">183 acl-2011-Joint Bilingual Sentiment Classification with Unlabeled Parallel Corpora</a></p>
<p>Author: Bin Lu ; Chenhao Tan ; Claire Cardie ; Benjamin K. Tsou</p><p>Abstract: Most previous work on multilingual sentiment analysis has focused on methods to adapt sentiment resources from resource-rich languages to resource-poor languages. We present a novel approach for joint bilingual sentiment classification at the sentence level that augments available labeled data in each language with unlabeled parallel data. We rely on the intuition that the sentiment labels for parallel sentences should be similar and present a model that jointly learns improved monolingual sentiment classifiers for each language. Experiments on multiple data sets show that the proposed approach (1) outperforms the monolingual baselines, significantly improving the accuracy for both languages by 3.44%-8. 12%; (2) outperforms two standard approaches for leveraging unlabeled data; and (3) produces (albeit smaller) performance gains when employing pseudo-parallel data from machine translation engines. 1</p><p>4 0.14650583 <a title="326-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Why_Press_Backspace%3F_Understanding_User_Input_Behaviors_in_Chinese_Pinyin_Input_Method.html">336 acl-2011-Why Press Backspace?

<p>Author: Zhongguo Li</p><p>Abstract: Lots of Chinese characters are very productive in that they can form many structured words either as prefixes or as suffixes. Previous research in Chinese word segmentation mainly focused on identifying only the word boundaries without considering the rich internal structures of many words. In this paper we argue that this is unsatisfying in many ways, both practically and theoretically. Instead, we propose that word structures should be recovered in morphological analysis. An elegant approach for doing this is given and the result is shown to be promising enough for encouraging further effort in this direction. Our probability model is trained with the Penn Chinese Treebank and actually is able to parse both word and phrase structures in a unified way. 1 Why Parse Word Structures? Research in Chinese word segmentation has progressed tremendously in recent years, with state of the art performing at around 97% in precision and recall (Xue, 2003; Gao et al., 2005; Zhang and Clark, 2007; Li and Sun, 2009). However, virtually all these systems focus exclusively on recognizing the word boundaries, giving no consideration to the internal structures of many words. Though it has been the standard practice for many years, we argue that this paradigm is inadequate both in theory and in practice, for at least the following four reasons. The first reason is that if we confine our definition of word segmentation to the identification of word boundaries, then people tend to have divergent 1405 opinions as to whether a linguistic unit is a word or not (Sproat et al., 1996). This has led to many different annotation standards for Chinese word segmentation. Even worse, this could cause inconsistency in the same corpus. For instance, 䉂 擌 奒 ‘vice president’ is considered to be one word in the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005), but is split into two words by the Peking University corpus in the SIGHAN Bakeoffs (Sproat and Emerson, 2003). Meanwhile, 䉂 䀓 惼 ‘vice director’ and 䉂 䚲䡮 ‘deputy are both segmented into two words in the same Penn Chinese Treebank. In fact, all these words are composed of the prefix 䉂 ‘vice’ and a root word. Thus the structure of 䉂擌奒 ‘vice president’ can be represented with the tree in Figure 1. Without a doubt, there is complete agree- manager’ NN ,,ll JJf NNf 䉂 擌奒 Figure 1: Example of a word with internal structure. ment on the correctness of this structure among native Chinese speakers. So if instead of annotating only word boundaries, we annotate the structures of every word, then the annotation tends to be more 1 1Here it is necessary to add a note on terminology used in this paper. Since there is no universally accepted definition of the “word” concept in linguistics and especially in Chinese, whenever we use the term “word” we might mean a linguistic unit such as 䉂 擌奒 ‘vice president’ whose structure is shown as the tree in Figure 1, or we might mean a smaller unit such as 擌奒 ‘president’ which is a substructure of that tree. Hopefully, ProceedingPso orftla thned 4,9 Otrhe Agonnn,u Jauln Mee 1e9t-i2ng4, o 2f0 t1h1e. A ?c s 2o0ci1a1ti Aonss foocria Ctioomnp fourta Ctioomnaplu Ltaintigouniaslti Lcisn,g puaigsetsic 1s405–1414, consistent and there could be less duplication of efforts in developing the expensive annotated corpus. The second reason is applications have different requirements for granularity of words. Take the personal name 撱 嗤吼 ‘Zhou Shuren’ as an example. It’s considered to be one word in the Penn Chinese Treebank, but is segmented into a surname and a given name in the Peking University corpus. For some applications such as information extraction, the former segmentation is adequate, while for others like machine translation, the later finer-grained output is more preferable. If the analyzer can produce a structure as shown in Figure 4(a), then every application can extract what it needs from this tree. A solution with tree output like this is more elegant than approaches which try to meet the needs of different applications in post-processing (Gao et al., 2004). The third reason is that traditional word segmentation has problems in handling many phenomena in Chinese. For example, the telescopic compound 㦌 撥 怂惆 ‘universities, middle schools and primary schools’ is in fact composed ofthree coordinating elements 㦌惆 ‘university’, 撥 惆 ‘middle school’ and 怂惆 ‘primary school’ . Regarding it as one flat word loses this important information. Another example is separable words like 扩 扙 ‘swim’ . With a linear segmentation, the meaning of ‘swimming’ as in 扩 堑 扙 ‘after swimming’ cannot be properly represented, since 扩扙 ‘swim’ will be segmented into discontinuous units. These language usages lie at the boundary between syntax and morphology, and are not uncommon in Chinese. They can be adequately represented with trees (Figure 2).

The last reason why we should care about word the context will always make it clear what is being referred to with the term “word”. 1406 structures is related to head driven statistical parsers (Collins, 2003). To illustrate this, note that in the Penn Chinese Treebank, the word 戽 䊂䠽 吼 ‘English People’ does not occur at all. Hence constituents headed by such words could cause some difficulty for head driven models in which out-ofvocabulary words need to be treated specially both when they are generated and when they are conditioned upon. But this word is in turn headed by its suffix 吼 ‘people’, and there are 2,233 such words in Penn Chinese Treebank. If we annotate the structure of every compound containing this suffix (e.g. Figure 3), such data sparsity simply goes away.</p><p>6 0.12811773 <a title="326-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Discovery_of_Topically_Coherent_Sentences_for_Extractive_Summarization.html">98 acl-2011-Discovery of Topically Coherent Sentences for Extractive Summarization</a></p>

<p>Author: Omar F. Zaidan ; Chris Callison-Burch</p><p>Abstract: The written form of Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), differs quite a bit from the spoken dialects of Arabic, which are the true “native” languages of Arabic speakers used in daily life. However, due to MSA’s prevalence in written form, almost all Arabic datasets have predominantly MSA content. We present the Arabic Online Commentary Dataset, a 52M-word monolingual dataset rich in dialectal content, and we describe our long-term annotation effort to identify the dialect level (and dialect itself) in each sentence of the dataset. So far, we have labeled 108K sentences, 41% of which as having dialectal content. We also present experimental results on the task of automatic dialect identification, using the collected labels for training and evaluation.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.60910738 <a title="326-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Using_Bilingual_Information_for_Cross-Language_Document_Summarization.html">326 acl-2011-Using Bilingual Information for Cross-Language Document Summarization</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaojun Wan</p><p>Abstract: Cross-language document summarization is defined as the task of producing a summary in a target language (e.g. Chinese) for a set of documents in a source language (e.g. English). Existing methods for addressing this task make use of either the information from the original documents in the source language or the information from the translated documents in the target language. In this study, we propose to use the bilingual information from both the source and translated documents for this task. Two summarization methods (SimFusion and CoRank) are proposed to leverage the bilingual information in the graph-based ranking framework for cross-language summary extraction. Experimental results on the DUC2001 dataset with manually translated reference Chinese summaries show the effectiveness of the proposed methods. 1</p><p>3 0.57793993 <a title="326-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-An_Interface_for_Rapid_Natural_Language_Processing_Development_in_UIMA.html">42 acl-2011-An Interface for Rapid Natural Language Processing Development in UIMA</a></p>
<p>Author: Balaji Soundrarajan ; Thomas Ginter ; Scott DuVall</p><p>Abstract: This demonstration presents the Annotation Librarian, an application programming interface that supports rapid development of natural language processing (NLP) projects built in Apache Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA). The flexibility of UIMA to support all types of unstructured data – images, audio, and text – increases the complexity of some of the most common NLP development tasks. The Annotation Librarian interface handles these common functions and allows the creation and management of annotations by mirroring Java methods used to manipulate Strings. The familiar syntax and NLP-centric design allows developers to adopt and rapidly develop NLP algorithms in UIMA. The general functionality of the interface is described in relation to the use cases that necessitated its creation. 1</p><p>4 0.56577331 <a title="326-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Subjectivity_and_Sentiment_Analysis_of_Modern_Standard_Arabic.html">289 acl-2011-Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis of Modern Standard Arabic</a></p>
<p>Author: Muhammad Abdul-Mageed ; Mona Diab ; Mohammed Korayem</p><p>Abstract: Although Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis (SSA) has been witnessing a flurry of novel research, there are few attempts to build SSA systems for Morphologically-Rich Languages (MRL). In the current study, we report efforts to partially fill this gap. We present a newly developed manually annotated corpus ofModern Standard Arabic (MSA) together with a new polarity lexicon.The corpus is a collection of newswire documents annotated on the sentence level. We also describe an automatic SSA tagging system that exploits the annotated data. We investigate the impact of different levels ofpreprocessing settings on the SSA classification task. We show that by explicitly accounting for the rich morphology the system is able to achieve significantly higher levels of performance.</p><p>5 0.56312406 <a title="326-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Classifying_arguments_by_scheme.html">68 acl-2011-Classifying arguments by scheme</a></p>
<p>Author: Vanessa Wei Feng ; Graeme Hirst</p><p>Abstract: Argumentation schemes are structures or templates for various kinds of arguments. Given the text of an argument with premises and conclusion identified, we classify it as an instance ofone offive common schemes, using features specific to each scheme. We achieve accuracies of 63–91% in one-against-others classification and 80–94% in pairwise classification (baseline = 50% in both cases).</p><p>6 0.4599317 <a title="326-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-I_Thou_Thee%2C_Thou_Traitor%3A_Predicting_Formal_vs._Informal_Address_in_English_Literature.html">157 acl-2011-I Thou Thee, Thou Traitor: Predicting Formal vs. Informal Address in English Literature</a></p>

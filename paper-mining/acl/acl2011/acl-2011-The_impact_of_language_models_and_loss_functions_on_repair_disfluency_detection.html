<p>Author: Miao Chen ; Klaus Zechner</p><p>Abstract: This paper focuses on identifying, extracting and evaluating features related to syntactic complexity of spontaneous spoken responses as part of an effort to expand the current feature set of an automated speech scoring system in order to cover additional aspects considered important in the construct of communicative competence. Our goal is to find effective features, selected from a large set of features proposed previously and some new features designed in analogous ways from a syntactic complexity perspective that correlate well with human ratings of the same spoken responses, and to build automatic scoring models based on the most promising features by using machine learning methods. On human transcriptions with manually annotated clause and sentence boundaries, our best scoring model achieves an overall Pearson correlation with human rater scores of r=0.49 on an unseen test set, whereas correlations of models using sentence or clause boundaries from automated classifiers are around r=0.2. 1</p><p>3 0.10330006 <a title="301-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Detection_of_Agreement_and_Disagreement_in_Broadcast_Conversations.html">95 acl-2011-Detection of Agreement and Disagreement in Broadcast Conversations</a></p>
<p>Author: Wen Wang ; Sibel Yaman ; Kristin Precoda ; Colleen Richey ; Geoffrey Raymond</p><p>Abstract: We present Conditional Random Fields based approaches for detecting agreement/disagreement between speakers in English broadcast conversation shows. We develop annotation approaches for a variety of linguistic phenomena. Various lexical, structural, durational, and prosodic features are explored. We compare the performance when using features extracted from automatically generated annotations against that when using human annotations. We investigate the efficacy of adding prosodic features on top of lexical, structural, and durational features. Since the training data is highly imbalanced, we explore two sampling approaches, random downsampling and ensemble downsampling. Overall, our approach achieves 79.2% (precision), 50.5% (recall), 61.7% (F1) for agreement detection and 69.2% (precision), 46.9% (recall), and 55.9% (F1) for disagreement detection, on the English broadcast conversation data. 1 ?yIntroduction In ?ythis work, we present models for detecting agre?yement/disagreement (denoted (dis)agreement) betwy?een speakers in English broadcast conversation show?ys. The Broadcast Conversation (BC) genre differs from the Broadcast News (BN) genre in that it is?y more interactive and spontaneous, referring to freey? speech in news-style TV and radio programs and consisting of talk shows, interviews, call-in prog?yrams, live reports, and round-tables. Previous y? y?This work was performed while the author was at ICSI. syaman@us . ibm .com, graymond@ s oc .uc sb . edu work on detecting (dis)agreements has been focused on meeting data. (Hillard et al., 2003), (Galley et al., 2004), (Hahn et al., 2006) used spurt-level agreement annotations from the ICSI meeting corpus (Janin et al., 2003). (Hillard et al., 2003) explored unsupervised machine learning approaches and on manual transcripts, they achieved an overall 3-way agreement/disagreement classification ac- curacy as 82% with keyword features. (Galley et al., 2004) explored Bayesian Networks for the detection of (dis)agreements. They used adjacency pair information to determine the structure of their conditional Markov model and outperformed the results of (Hillard et al., 2003) by improving the 3way classification accuracy into 86.9%. (Hahn et al., 2006) explored semi-supervised learning algorithms and reached a competitive performance of 86.7% 3-way classification accuracy on manual transcriptions with only lexical features. (Germesin and Wilson, 2009) investigated supervised machine learning techniques and yields competitive results on the annotated data from the AMI meeting corpus (McCowan et al., 2005). Our work differs from these previous studies in two major categories. One is that a different definition of (dis)agreement was used. In the current work, a (dis)agreement occurs when a responding speaker agrees with, accepts, or disagrees with or rejects, a statement or proposition by a first speaker. Second, we explored (dis)agreement detection in broadcast conversation. Due to the difference in publicity and intimacy/collegiality between speakers in broadcast conversations vs. meet- ings, (dis)agreement may have different character374 Proceedings ofP thoer t4l9atnhd A, Onrnuegaoln M,e Jeuntineg 19 o-f2 t4h,e 2 A0s1s1o.c?i ac t2io0n11 fo Ar Cssoocmiaptuiotanti foonra Clo Lminpguutiast i ocns:aslh Loirntpgaupisetrics , pages 374–378, istics. Different from the unsupervised approaches in (Hillard et al., 2003) and semi-supervised approaches in (Hahn et al., 2006), we conducted supervised training. Also, different from (Hillard et al., 2003) and (Galley et al., 2004), our classification was carried out on the utterance level, instead of on the spurt-level. Galley et al. extended Hillard et al.’s work by adding features from previous spurts and features from the general dialog context to infer the class of the current spurt, on top of features from the current spurt (local features) used by Hillard et al. Galley et al. used adjacency pairs to describe the interaction between speakers and the relations between consecutive spurts. In this preliminary study on broadcast conversation, we directly modeled (dis)agreement detection without using adjacency pairs. Still, within the conditional random fields (CRF) framework, we explored features from preceding and following utterances to consider context in the discourse structure. We explored a wide variety of features, including lexical, structural, du- rational, and prosodic features. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate detection of agreement/disagreement for broadcast conversation data. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our data and automatic annotation modules. Section 3 describes various features and the CRF model we explored. Experimental results and discussion appear in Section 4, as well as conclusions and future directions. 2 Data and Automatic Annotation In this work, we selected English broadcast conversation data from the DARPA GALE program collected data (GALE Phase 1 Release 4, LDC2006E91; GALE Phase 4 Release 2, LDC2009E15). Human transcriptions and manual speaker turn labels are used in this study. Also, since the (dis)agreement detection output will be used to analyze social roles and relations of an interacting group, we first manually marked soundbites and then excluded soundbites during annotation and modeling. We recruited annotators to provide manual annotations of speaker roles and (dis)agreement to use for the supervised training of models. We de- fined a set of speaker roles as follows. Host/chair is a person associated with running the discussions 375 or calling the meeting. Reporting participant is a person reporting from the field, from a subcommittee, etc. Commentator participant/Topic participant is a person providing commentary on some subject, or person who is the subject of the conversation and plays a role, e.g., as a newsmaker. Audience participant is an ordinary person who may call in, ask questions at a microphone at e.g. a large presentation, or be interviewed because of their presence at a news event. Other is any speaker who does not fit in one of the above categories, such as a voice talent, an announcer doing show openings or commercial breaks, or a translator. Agreements and disagreements are composed of different combinations of initiating utterances and responses. We reformulated the (dis)agreement detection task as the sequence tagging of 11 (dis)agreement-related labels for identifying whether a given utterance is initiating a (dis)agreement opportunity, is a (dis)agreement response to such an opportunity, or is neither of these, in the show. For example, a Negative tag question followed by a negation response forms an agreement, that is, A: [Negative tag] This is not black and white, is it? B: [Agreeing Response] No, it isn’t. The data sparsity problem is serious. Among all 27,071 utterances, only 2,589 utterances are involved in (dis)agreement as initiating or response utterances, about 10% only among all data, while 24,482 utterances are not involved. These annotators also labeled shows with a variety of linguistic phenomena (denoted language use constituents, LUC), including discourse markers, disfluencies, person addresses and person mentions, prefaces, extreme case formulations, and dialog act tags (DAT). We categorized dialog acts into statement, question, backchannel, and incomplete. We classified disfluencies (DF) into filled pauses (e.g., uh, um), repetitions, corrections, and false starts. Person address (PA) terms are terms that a speaker uses to address another person. Person mentions (PM) are references to non-participants in the conversation. Discourse markers (DM) are words or phrases that are related to the structure of the discourse and express a relation between two utter- ances, for example, I mean, you know. Prefaces (PR) are sentence-initial lexical tokens serving functions close to discourse markers (e.g., Well, I think that...). Extreme case formulations (ECF) are lexical patterns emphasizing extremeness (e.g., This is the best book I have ever read). In the end, we manually annotated 49 English shows. We preprocessed English manual transcripts by removing transcriber annotation markers and noise, removing punctuation and case information, and conducting text normalization. We also built automatic rule-based and statistical annotation tools for these LUCs. 3 Features and Model We explored lexical, structural, durational, and prosodic features for (dis)agreement detection. We included a set of “lexical” features, including ngrams extracted from all of that speaker’s utterances, denoted ngram features. Other lexical features include the presence of negation and acquiescence, yes/no equivalents, positive and negative tag questions, and other features distinguishing different types of initiating utterances and responses. We also included various lexical features extracted from LUC annotations, denoted LUC features. These additional features include features related to the presence of prefaces, the counts of types and tokens of discourse markers, extreme case formulations, disfluencies, person addressing events, and person mentions, and the normalized values of these counts by sentence length. We also include a set of features related to the DAT of the current utterance and preceding and following utterances. We developed a set of “structural” and “durational” features, inspired by conversation analysis, to quantitatively represent the different participation and interaction patterns of speakers in a show. We extracted features related to pausing and overlaps between consecutive turns, the absolute and relative duration of consecutive turns, and so on. We used a set of prosodic features including pause, duration, and the speech rate of a speaker. We also used pitch and energy of the voice. Prosodic features were computed on words and phonetic alignment of manual transcripts. Features are computed for the beginning and ending words of an utterance. For the duration features, we used the average and maximum vowel duration from forced align- ment, both unnormalized and normalized for vowel identity and phone context. For pitch and energy, we 376 calculated the minimum, maximum,E range, mean, standard deviation, skewnesSs and kurEtosis values. A decision tree model was useSd to comEpute posteriors fFrom prosodic features and Swe used cuEmulative binnFing of posteriors as final feSatures , simEilar to (Liu et aFl., 2006).

During testing, the most likely sequence E is found using the Viterbi algorithm. One of the motivations of choosing conditional random fields was to avoid the label-bias problem found in hidden Markov models. Compared to Maximum Entropy modeling, the CRF model is optimized globally over the entire sequence, whereas the ME model makes a decision at each point individually without considering the context event information. 4 Experiments All (dis)agreement detection results are based on nfold cross-validation. In this procedure, we held out one show as the test set, randomly held out another show as the dev set, trained models on the rest of the data, and tested the model on the heldout show. We iterated through all shows and computed the overall accuracy. Table 1 shows the results of (dis)agreement detection using all features except prosodic features. We compared two conditions: (1) features extracted completely from the automatic LUC annotations and automatically detected speaker roles, and (2) features from manual speaker role labels and manual LUC annotations when man- ual annotations are available. Table 1 showed that running a fully automatic system to generate automatic annotations and automatic speaker roles produced comparable performance to the system using features from manual annotations whenever available. Table 1: Precision (%), recall (%), and F1 (%) of (dis)agreement detection using features extracted from manual speaker role labels and manual LUC annotations when available, denoted Manual Annotation, and automatic LUC annotations and automatically detected speaker roles, denoted Automatic Annotation.

The results are shown in Table 2. Adding prosodic features produced a 0.7% absolute gain on F1 on agreement detection, and 1.5% absolute gain on F1 on disagreement detection.

This indicates a highly imbalanced data set as one class is more heavily represented than the other/others. We suspected that this high imbalance has played a major role in the high precision and low recall results we obtained so far. Various approaches have been studied to handle imbalanced data for classifications, 377 trying to balaNnce the class distribution in the training set by eithNer oversaNmpling the minority class or downsamplinNg the maNjority class. In this preliminary study of NNsamplingN Napproaches for handling imbalanced dataN NNfor CRF Ntraining, we investigated two apprNoaches, rNNandom dNownsampling and ensemble dowNnsamplinNgN. RandoNm downsampling randomly dowNnsamples NNthe majorNity class to equate the number Nof minoritNNy and maNjority class samples. Ensemble NdownsampNNling is a N refinement of random downsamNpling whiNNch doesn’Nt discard any majority class samNples. InstNNead, we pNartitioned the majority class samNples into NN subspaNces with each subspace containiNng the samNe numbNer of samples as the minority clasNs. Then wNe train N CRF models, each based on thNe minoritNy class samples and one disjoint partitionN Nfrom the N subspaces. During testing, the posterioNr probability for one utterance is averaged over the N CRF models. The results from these two sampling approaches as well as the baseline are shown in Table 3. Both sampling approaches achieved significant improvement over the baseline, i.e., train- ing on the original data set, and ensemble downsampling produced better performance than downsampling. We noticed that both sampling approaches degraded slightly in precision but improved significantly in recall, resulting in 4.5% absolute gain on F1 for agreement detection and 4.7% absolute gain on F1 for disagreement detection.

We explored a variety of features, including lexical, structural, durational, and prosodic features. We experimented these features using a linear-chain conditional random fields model and conducted supervised training. We observed significant improvement from adding prosodic features and employing two sampling approaches, random downsampling and ensemble downsampling. Overall, we achieved 79.2% (precision), 50.5% (recall), 61.7% (F1) for agreement detection and 69.2% (precision), 46.9% (recall), and 55.9% (F1) for disagreement detection, on English broadcast conversation data. In future work, we plan to continue adding and refining features, explore dependencies between features and contextual cues with respect to agreements and disagreements, and investigate the efficacy of other machine learning approaches such as Bayesian networks and Support Vector Machines.

<p>Author: Dong Wang ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a pilot study of opinion summarization on conversations. We create a corpus containing extractive and abstractive summaries of speaker’s opinion towards a given topic using 88 telephone conversations. We adopt two methods to perform extractive summarization. The first one is a sentence-ranking method that linearly combines scores measured from different aspects including topic relevance, subjectivity, and sentence importance. The second one is a graph-based method, which incorporates topic and sentiment information, as well as additional information about sentence-to-sentence relations extracted based on dialogue structure. Our evaluation results show that both methods significantly outperform the baseline approach that extracts the longest utterances. In particular, we find that incorporating dialogue structure in the graph-based method contributes to the improved system performance.</p><p>5 0.095411286 <a title="301-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Event_Extraction_as_Dependency_Parsing.html">122 acl-2011-Event Extraction as Dependency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: David McClosky ; Mihai Surdeanu ; Christopher Manning</p><p>Abstract: Nested event structures are a common occurrence in both open domain and domain specific extraction tasks, e.g., a “crime” event can cause a “investigation” event, which can lead to an “arrest” event. However, most current approaches address event extraction with highly local models that extract each event and argument independently. We propose a simple approach for the extraction of such structures by taking the tree of event-argument relations and using it directly as the representation in a reranking dependency parser. This provides a simple framework that captures global properties of both nested and flat event structures. We explore a rich feature space that models both the events to be parsed and context from the original supporting text. Our approach obtains competitive results in the extraction of biomedical events from the BioNLP’09 shared task with a F1 score of 53.5% in development and 48.6% in testing.</p><p>6 0.092414565 <a title="301-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Question_Detection_in_Spoken_Conversations_Using_Textual_Conversations.html">257 acl-2011-Question Detection in Spoken Conversations Using Textual Conversations</a></p>

<p>Author: Simon Zwarts ; Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: Unrehearsed spoken language often contains disfluencies. In order to correctly interpret a spoken utterance, any such disfluencies must be identified and removed or otherwise dealt with. Operating on transcripts of speech which contain disfluencies, we study the effect of language model and loss function on the performance of a linear reranker that rescores the 25-best output of a noisychannel model. We show that language models trained on large amounts of non-speech data improve performance more than a language model trained on a more modest amount of speech data, and that optimising f-score rather than log loss improves disfluency detection performance. Our approach uses a log-linear reranker, operating on the top n analyses of a noisy channel model. We use large language models, introduce new features into this reranker and . examine different optimisation strategies. We obtain a disfluency detection f-scores of 0.838 which improves upon the current state-of-theart.</p><p>2 0.66034853 <a title="301-lsi-2" href="./acl-2011-N-Best_Rescoring_Based_on_Pitch-accent_Patterns.html">228 acl-2011-N-Best Rescoring Based on Pitch-accent Patterns</a></p>
<p>Author: Je Hun Jeon ; Wen Wang ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we adopt an n-best rescoring scheme using pitch-accent patterns to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance. The pitch-accent model is decoupled from the main ASR system, thus allowing us to develop it independently. N-best hypotheses from recognizers are rescored by additional scores that measure the correlation of the pitch-accent patterns between the acoustic signal and lexical cues. To test the robustness of our algorithm, we use two different data sets and recognition setups: the first one is English radio news data that has pitch accent labels, but the recognizer is trained from a small amount ofdata and has high error rate; the second one is English broadcast news data using a state-of-the-art SRI recognizer. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach is able to reduce word error rate relatively by about 3%. This gain is consistent across the two different tests, showing promising future directions of incorporating prosodic information to improve speech recognition.</p><p>3 0.65773964 <a title="301-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-Computing_and_Evaluating_Syntactic_Complexity_Features_for_Automated_Scoring_of_Spontaneous_Non-Native_Speech.html">77 acl-2011-Computing and Evaluating Syntactic Complexity Features for Automated Scoring of Spontaneous Non-Native Speech</a></p>
<p>Author: Miao Chen ; Klaus Zechner</p><p>Abstract: This paper focuses on identifying, extracting and evaluating features related to syntactic complexity of spontaneous spoken responses as part of an effort to expand the current feature set of an automated speech scoring system in order to cover additional aspects considered important in the construct of communicative competence. Our goal is to find effective features, selected from a large set of features proposed previously and some new features designed in analogous ways from a syntactic complexity perspective that correlate well with human ratings of the same spoken responses, and to build automatic scoring models based on the most promising features by using machine learning methods. On human transcriptions with manually annotated clause and sentence boundaries, our best scoring model achieves an overall Pearson correlation with human rater scores of r=0.49 on an unseen test set, whereas correlations of models using sentence or clause boundaries from automated classifiers are around r=0.2. 1</p><p>4 0.63965642 <a title="301-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Ordering_Prenominal_Modifiers_with_a_Reranking_Approach.html">237 acl-2011-Ordering Prenominal Modifiers with a Reranking Approach</a></p>

<p>Author: Wen Wang ; Sibel Yaman ; Kristin Precoda ; Colleen Richey ; Geoffrey Raymond</p><p>Abstract: We present Conditional Random Fields based approaches for detecting agreement/disagreement between speakers in English broadcast conversation shows. We develop annotation approaches for a variety of linguistic phenomena. Various lexical, structural, durational, and prosodic features are explored. We compare the performance when using features extracted from automatically generated annotations against that when using human annotations. We investigate the efficacy of adding prosodic features on top of lexical, structural, and durational features. Since the training data is highly imbalanced, we explore two sampling approaches, random downsampling and ensemble downsampling. Overall, our approach achieves 79.2% (precision), 50.5% (recall), 61.7% (F1) for agreement detection and 69.2% (precision), 46.9% (recall), and 55.9% (F1) for disagreement detection, on the English broadcast conversation data. 1 ?yIntroduction In ?ythis work, we present models for detecting agre?yement/disagreement (denoted (dis)agreement) betwy?een speakers in English broadcast conversation show?ys. The Broadcast Conversation (BC) genre differs from the Broadcast News (BN) genre in that it is?y more interactive and spontaneous, referring to freey? speech in news-style TV and radio programs and consisting of talk shows, interviews, call-in prog?yrams, live reports, and round-tables. Previous y? y?This work was performed while the author was at ICSI. syaman@us . ibm .com, graymond@ s oc .uc sb . edu work on detecting (dis)agreements has been focused on meeting data. (Hillard et al., 2003), (Galley et al., 2004), (Hahn et al., 2006) used spurt-level agreement annotations from the ICSI meeting corpus (Janin et al., 2003). (Hillard et al., 2003) explored unsupervised machine learning approaches and on manual transcripts, they achieved an overall 3-way agreement/disagreement classification ac- curacy as 82% with keyword features. (Galley et al., 2004) explored Bayesian Networks for the detection of (dis)agreements. They used adjacency pair information to determine the structure of their conditional Markov model and outperformed the results of (Hillard et al., 2003) by improving the 3way classification accuracy into 86.9%. (Hahn et al., 2006) explored semi-supervised learning algorithms and reached a competitive performance of 86.7% 3-way classification accuracy on manual transcriptions with only lexical features. (Germesin and Wilson, 2009) investigated supervised machine learning techniques and yields competitive results on the annotated data from the AMI meeting corpus (McCowan et al., 2005). Our work differs from these previous studies in two major categories. One is that a different definition of (dis)agreement was used. In the current work, a (dis)agreement occurs when a responding speaker agrees with, accepts, or disagrees with or rejects, a statement or proposition by a first speaker. Second, we explored (dis)agreement detection in broadcast conversation. Due to the difference in publicity and intimacy/collegiality between speakers in broadcast conversations vs. meet- ings, (dis)agreement may have different character374 Proceedings ofP thoer t4l9atnhd A, Onrnuegaoln M,e Jeuntineg 19 o-f2 t4h,e 2 A0s1s1o.c?i ac t2io0n11 fo Ar Cssoocmiaptuiotanti foonra Clo Lminpguutiast i ocns:aslh Loirntpgaupisetrics , pages 374–378, istics. Different from the unsupervised approaches in (Hillard et al., 2003) and semi-supervised approaches in (Hahn et al., 2006), we conducted supervised training. Also, different from (Hillard et al., 2003) and (Galley et al., 2004), our classification was carried out on the utterance level, instead of on the spurt-level. Galley et al. extended Hillard et al.’s work by adding features from previous spurts and features from the general dialog context to infer the class of the current spurt, on top of features from the current spurt (local features) used by Hillard et al. Galley et al. used adjacency pairs to describe the interaction between speakers and the relations between consecutive spurts. In this preliminary study on broadcast conversation, we directly modeled (dis)agreement detection without using adjacency pairs. Still, within the conditional random fields (CRF) framework, we explored features from preceding and following utterances to consider context in the discourse structure. We explored a wide variety of features, including lexical, structural, du- rational, and prosodic features. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate detection of agreement/disagreement for broadcast conversation data. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our data and automatic annotation modules. Section 3 describes various features and the CRF model we explored. Experimental results and discussion appear in Section 4, as well as conclusions and future directions. 2 Data and Automatic Annotation In this work, we selected English broadcast conversation data from the DARPA GALE program collected data (GALE Phase 1 Release 4, LDC2006E91; GALE Phase 4 Release 2, LDC2009E15). Human transcriptions and manual speaker turn labels are used in this study. Also, since the (dis)agreement detection output will be used to analyze social roles and relations of an interacting group, we first manually marked soundbites and then excluded soundbites during annotation and modeling. We recruited annotators to provide manual annotations of speaker roles and (dis)agreement to use for the supervised training of models. We de- fined a set of speaker roles as follows. Host/chair is a person associated with running the discussions 375 or calling the meeting. Reporting participant is a person reporting from the field, from a subcommittee, etc. Commentator participant/Topic participant is a person providing commentary on some subject, or person who is the subject of the conversation and plays a role, e.g., as a newsmaker. Audience participant is an ordinary person who may call in, ask questions at a microphone at e.g. a large presentation, or be interviewed because of their presence at a news event. Other is any speaker who does not fit in one of the above categories, such as a voice talent, an announcer doing show openings or commercial breaks, or a translator. Agreements and disagreements are composed of different combinations of initiating utterances and responses. We reformulated the (dis)agreement detection task as the sequence tagging of 11 (dis)agreement-related labels for identifying whether a given utterance is initiating a (dis)agreement opportunity, is a (dis)agreement response to such an opportunity, or is neither of these, in the show. For example, a Negative tag question followed by a negation response forms an agreement, that is, A: [Negative tag] This is not black and white, is it? B: [Agreeing Response] No, it isn’t. The data sparsity problem is serious. Among all 27,071 utterances, only 2,589 utterances are involved in (dis)agreement as initiating or response utterances, about 10% only among all data, while 24,482 utterances are not involved. These annotators also labeled shows with a variety of linguistic phenomena (denoted language use constituents, LUC), including discourse markers, disfluencies, person addresses and person mentions, prefaces, extreme case formulations, and dialog act tags (DAT). We categorized dialog acts into statement, question, backchannel, and incomplete. We classified disfluencies (DF) into filled pauses (e.g., uh, um), repetitions, corrections, and false starts. Person address (PA) terms are terms that a speaker uses to address another person. Person mentions (PM) are references to non-participants in the conversation. Discourse markers (DM) are words or phrases that are related to the structure of the discourse and express a relation between two utter- ances, for example, I mean, you know. Prefaces (PR) are sentence-initial lexical tokens serving functions close to discourse markers (e.g., Well, I think that...). Extreme case formulations (ECF) are lexical patterns emphasizing extremeness (e.g., This is the best book I have ever read). In the end, we manually annotated 49 English shows. We preprocessed English manual transcripts by removing transcriber annotation markers and noise, removing punctuation and case information, and conducting text normalization. We also built automatic rule-based and statistical annotation tools for these LUCs. 3 Features and Model We explored lexical, structural, durational, and prosodic features for (dis)agreement detection. We included a set of “lexical” features, including ngrams extracted from all of that speaker’s utterances, denoted ngram features. Other lexical features include the presence of negation and acquiescence, yes/no equivalents, positive and negative tag questions, and other features distinguishing different types of initiating utterances and responses. We also included various lexical features extracted from LUC annotations, denoted LUC features. These additional features include features related to the presence of prefaces, the counts of types and tokens of discourse markers, extreme case formulations, disfluencies, person addressing events, and person mentions, and the normalized values of these counts by sentence length. We also include a set of features related to the DAT of the current utterance and preceding and following utterances. We developed a set of “structural” and “durational” features, inspired by conversation analysis, to quantitatively represent the different participation and interaction patterns of speakers in a show. We extracted features related to pausing and overlaps between consecutive turns, the absolute and relative duration of consecutive turns, and so on. We used a set of prosodic features including pause, duration, and the speech rate of a speaker. We also used pitch and energy of the voice. Prosodic features were computed on words and phonetic alignment of manual transcripts. Features are computed for the beginning and ending words of an utterance. For the duration features, we used the average and maximum vowel duration from forced align- ment, both unnormalized and normalized for vowel identity and phone context. For pitch and energy, we 376 calculated the minimum, maximum,E range, mean, standard deviation, skewnesSs and kurEtosis values. A decision tree model was useSd to comEpute posteriors fFrom prosodic features and Swe used cuEmulative binnFing of posteriors as final feSatures , simEilar to (Liu et aFl., 2006).

During testing, the most likely sequence E is found using the Viterbi algorithm. One of the motivations of choosing conditional random fields was to avoid the label-bias problem found in hidden Markov models. Compared to Maximum Entropy modeling, the CRF model is optimized globally over the entire sequence, whereas the ME model makes a decision at each point individually without considering the context event information. 4 Experiments All (dis)agreement detection results are based on nfold cross-validation. In this procedure, we held out one show as the test set, randomly held out another show as the dev set, trained models on the rest of the data, and tested the model on the heldout show. We iterated through all shows and computed the overall accuracy. Table 1 shows the results of (dis)agreement detection using all features except prosodic features. We compared two conditions: (1) features extracted completely from the automatic LUC annotations and automatically detected speaker roles, and (2) features from manual speaker role labels and manual LUC annotations when man- ual annotations are available. Table 1 showed that running a fully automatic system to generate automatic annotations and automatic speaker roles produced comparable performance to the system using features from manual annotations whenever available. Table 1: Precision (%), recall (%), and F1 (%) of (dis)agreement detection using features extracted from manual speaker role labels and manual LUC annotations when available, denoted Manual Annotation, and automatic LUC annotations and automatically detected speaker roles, denoted Automatic Annotation.

The results are shown in Table 2. Adding prosodic features produced a 0.7% absolute gain on F1 on agreement detection, and 1.5% absolute gain on F1 on disagreement detection.

This indicates a highly imbalanced data set as one class is more heavily represented than the other/others. We suspected that this high imbalance has played a major role in the high precision and low recall results we obtained so far. Various approaches have been studied to handle imbalanced data for classifications, 377 trying to balaNnce the class distribution in the training set by eithNer oversaNmpling the minority class or downsamplinNg the maNjority class. In this preliminary study of NNsamplingN Napproaches for handling imbalanced dataN NNfor CRF Ntraining, we investigated two apprNoaches, rNNandom dNownsampling and ensemble dowNnsamplinNgN. RandoNm downsampling randomly dowNnsamples NNthe majorNity class to equate the number Nof minoritNNy and maNjority class samples. Ensemble NdownsampNNling is a N refinement of random downsamNpling whiNNch doesn’Nt discard any majority class samNples. InstNNead, we pNartitioned the majority class samNples into NN subspaNces with each subspace containiNng the samNe numbNer of samples as the minority clasNs. Then wNe train N CRF models, each based on thNe minoritNy class samples and one disjoint partitionN Nfrom the N subspaces. During testing, the posterioNr probability for one utterance is averaged over the N CRF models. The results from these two sampling approaches as well as the baseline are shown in Table 3. Both sampling approaches achieved significant improvement over the baseline, i.e., train- ing on the original data set, and ensemble downsampling produced better performance than downsampling. We noticed that both sampling approaches degraded slightly in precision but improved significantly in recall, resulting in 4.5% absolute gain on F1 for agreement detection and 4.7% absolute gain on F1 for disagreement detection.

We explored a variety of features, including lexical, structural, durational, and prosodic features. We experimented these features using a linear-chain conditional random fields model and conducted supervised training. We observed significant improvement from adding prosodic features and employing two sampling approaches, random downsampling and ensemble downsampling. Overall, we achieved 79.2% (precision), 50.5% (recall), 61.7% (F1) for agreement detection and 69.2% (precision), 46.9% (recall), and 55.9% (F1) for disagreement detection, on English broadcast conversation data. In future work, we plan to continue adding and refining features, explore dependencies between features and contextual cues with respect to agreements and disagreements, and investigate the efficacy of other machine learning approaches such as Bayesian networks and Support Vector Machines.

<p>Author: Zhuowei Bao ; Benny Kimelfeld ; Yunyao Li</p><p>Abstract: Spelling correction for keyword-search queries is challenging in restricted domains such as personal email (or desktop) search, due to the scarcity of query logs, and due to the specialized nature of the domain. For that task, this paper presents an algorithm that is based on statistics from the corpus data (rather than the query log). This algorithm, which employs a simple graph-based approach, can incorporate different types of data sources with different levels of reliability (e.g., email subject vs. email body), and can handle complex spelling errors like splitting and merging of words. An experimental study shows the superiority of the algorithm over existing alternatives in the email domain.</p><p>2 0.72986078 <a title="301-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Exact_Decoding_of_Syntactic_Translation_Models_through_Lagrangian_Relaxation.html">123 acl-2011-Exact Decoding of Syntactic Translation Models through Lagrangian Relaxation</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexander M. Rush ; Michael Collins</p><p>Abstract: We describe an exact decoding algorithm for syntax-based statistical translation. The approach uses Lagrangian relaxation to decompose the decoding problem into tractable subproblems, thereby avoiding exhaustive dynamic programming. The method recovers exact solutions, with certificates of optimality, on over 97% of test examples; it has comparable speed to state-of-the-art decoders.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.72847903 <a title="301-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-The_impact_of_language_models_and_loss_functions_on_repair_disfluency_detection.html">301 acl-2011-The impact of language models and loss functions on repair disfluency detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Simon Zwarts ; Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: Unrehearsed spoken language often contains disfluencies. In order to correctly interpret a spoken utterance, any such disfluencies must be identified and removed or otherwise dealt with. Operating on transcripts of speech which contain disfluencies, we study the effect of language model and loss function on the performance of a linear reranker that rescores the 25-best output of a noisychannel model. We show that language models trained on large amounts of non-speech data improve performance more than a language model trained on a more modest amount of speech data, and that optimising f-score rather than log loss improves disfluency detection performance. Our approach uses a log-linear reranker, operating on the top n analyses of a noisy channel model. We use large language models, introduce new features into this reranker and . examine different optimisation strategies. We obtain a disfluency detection f-scores of 0.838 which improves upon the current state-of-theart.</p><p>4 0.66353601 <a title="301-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Data-oriented_Monologue-to-Dialogue_Generation.html">91 acl-2011-Data-oriented Monologue-to-Dialogue Generation</a></p>
<p>Author: Paul Piwek ; Svetlana Stoyanchev</p><p>Abstract: This short paper introduces an implemented and evaluated monolingual Text-to-Text generation system. The system takes monologue and transforms it to two-participant dialogue. After briefly motivating the task of monologue-to-dialogue generation, we describe the system and present an evaluation in terms of fluency and accuracy.</p><p>5 0.65934598 <a title="301-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Using_Deep_Morphology_to_Improve_Automatic_Error_Detection_in_Arabic_Handwriting_Recognition.html">329 acl-2011-Using Deep Morphology to Improve Automatic Error Detection in Arabic Handwriting Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Nizar Habash ; Ryan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Arabic handwriting recognition (HR) is a challenging problem due to Arabic’s connected letter forms, consonantal diacritics and rich morphology. In this paper we isolate the task of identification of erroneous words in HR from the task of producing corrections for these words. We consider a variety of linguistic (morphological and syntactic) and non-linguistic features to automatically identify these errors. Our best approach achieves a roughly ∼15% absolute increase in F-score aov reoru ag hsliym ∼pl1e5 b%ut a rbesaoslounteab inlec breaasseeli inne. F -Asc doreetailed error analysis shows that linguistic features, such as lemma (i.e., citation form) models, help improve HR-error detection precisely where we expect them to: semantically incoherent error words.</p><p>6 0.65421367 <a title="301-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Which_Noun_Phrases_Denote_Which_Concepts%3F.html">334 acl-2011-Which Noun Phrases Denote Which Concepts?</a></p>

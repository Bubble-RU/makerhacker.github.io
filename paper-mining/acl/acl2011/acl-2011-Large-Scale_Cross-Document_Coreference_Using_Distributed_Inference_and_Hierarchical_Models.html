<p>Author: Ryan Gabbard ; Marjorie Freedman ; Ralph Weischedel</p><p>Abstract: As an alternative to requiring substantial supervised relation training data, many have explored bootstrapping relation extraction from a few seed examples. Most techniques assume that the examples are based on easily spotted anchors, e.g., names or dates. Sentences in a corpus which contain the anchors are then used to induce alternative ways of expressing the relation. We explore whether coreference can improve the learning process. That is, if the algorithm considered examples such as his sister, would accuracy be improved? With coreference, we see on average a 2-fold increase in F-Score. Despite using potentially errorful machine coreference, we see significant increase in recall on all relations. Precision increases in four cases and decreases in six.</p><p>3 0.34354851 <a title="196-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-A_Pronoun_Anaphora_Resolution_System_based_on_Factorial_Hidden_Markov_Models.html">23 acl-2011-A Pronoun Anaphora Resolution System based on Factorial Hidden Markov Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Dingcheng Li ; Tim Miller ; William Schuler</p><p>Abstract: and Wellner, This paper presents a supervised pronoun anaphora resolution system based on factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs). The basic idea is that the hidden states of FHMMs are an explicit short-term memory with an antecedent buffer containing recently described referents. Thus an observed pronoun can find its antecedent from the hidden buffer, or in terms of a generative model, the entries in the hidden buffer generate the corresponding pronouns. A system implementing this model is evaluated on the ACE corpus with promising performance.</p><p>4 0.32637277 <a title="196-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Extending_the_Entity_Grid_with_Entity-Specific_Features.html">129 acl-2011-Extending the Entity Grid with Entity-Specific Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Micha Elsner ; Eugene Charniak</p><p>Abstract: We extend the popular entity grid representation for local coherence modeling. The grid abstracts away information about the entities it models; we add discourse prominence, named entity type and coreference features to distinguish between important and unimportant entities.

<p>Author: Xianpei Han ; Le Sun</p><p>Abstract: Linking entities with knowledge base (entity linking) is a key issue in bridging the textual data with the structural knowledge base. Due to the name variation problem and the name ambiguity problem, the entity linking decisions are critically depending on the heterogenous knowledge of entities. In this paper, we propose a generative probabilistic model, called entitymention model, which can leverage heterogenous entity knowledge (including popularity knowledge, name knowledge and context knowledge) for the entity linking task. In our model, each name mention to be linked is modeled as a sample generated through a three-step generative story, and the entity knowledge is encoded in the distribution of entities in document P(e), the distribution of possible names of a specific entity P(s|e), and the distribution of possible contexts of a specific entity P(c|e). To find the referent entity of a name mention, our method combines the evidences from all the three distributions P(e), P(s|e) and P(c|e). Experimental results show that our method can significantly outperform the traditional methods. 1</p><p>6 0.28465128 <a title="196-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Bootstrapping_coreference_resolution_using_word_associations.html">63 acl-2011-Bootstrapping coreference resolution using word associations</a></p>

<p>Author: Altaf Rahman ; Vincent Ng</p><p>Abstract: While world knowledge has been shown to improve learning-based coreference resolvers, the improvements were typically obtained by incorporating world knowledge into a fairly weak baseline resolver. Hence, it is not clear whether these benefits can carry over to a stronger baseline. Moreover, since there has been no attempt to apply different sources of world knowledge in combination to coreference resolution, it is not clear whether they offer complementary benefits to a resolver. We systematically compare commonly-used and under-investigated sources of world knowledge for coreference resolution by applying them to two learning-based coreference models and evaluating them on documents annotated with two different annotation schemes.</p><p>5 0.77537131 <a title="196-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Bootstrapping_coreference_resolution_using_word_associations.html">63 acl-2011-Bootstrapping coreference resolution using word associations</a></p>
<p>Author: Hamidreza Kobdani ; Hinrich Schuetze ; Michael Schiehlen ; Hans Kamp</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an unsupervised framework that bootstraps a complete coreference resolution (CoRe) system from word associations mined from a large unlabeled corpus. We show that word associations are useful for CoRe – e.g., the strong association between Obama and President is an indicator of likely coreference. Association information has so far not been used in CoRe because it is sparse and difficult to learn from small labeled corpora. Since unlabeled text is readily available, our unsupervised approach addresses the sparseness problem. In a self-training framework, we train a decision tree on a corpus that is automatically labeled using word associations. We show that this unsupervised system has better CoRe performance than other learning approaches that do not use manually labeled data. .</p><p>6 0.75740206 <a title="196-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-A_Cross-Lingual_ILP_Solution_to_Zero_Anaphora_Resolution.html">9 acl-2011-A Cross-Lingual ILP Solution to Zero Anaphora Resolution</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael Subotin</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an exponential model for translation into highly inflected languages which can be scaled to very large datasets. As in other recent proposals, it predicts targetside phrases and can be conditioned on sourceside context. However, crucially for the task of modeling morphological generalizations, it estimates feature parameters from the entire training set rather than as a collection of separate classifiers. We apply it to English-Czech translation, using a variety of features capturing potential predictors for case, number, and gender, and one of the largest publicly available parallel data sets. We also describe generation and modeling of inflected forms unobserved in training data and decoding procedures for a model with non-local target-side feature dependencies.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.78851473 <a title="196-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Large-Scale_Cross-Document_Coreference_Using_Distributed_Inference_and_Hierarchical_Models.html">196 acl-2011-Large-Scale Cross-Document Coreference Using Distributed Inference and Hierarchical Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Chung-chi Huang ; Mei-hua Chen ; Shih-ting Huang ; Jason S. Chang</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new method for learning to detect grammatical errors in learner’s writing and provide suggestions. The method involves parsing a reference corpus and inferring grammar patterns in the form of a sequence of content words, function words, and parts-of-speech (e.g., “play ~ role in Ving” and “look forward to Ving”). At runtime, the given passage submitted by the learner is matched using an extended Levenshtein algorithm against the set of pattern rules in order to detect errors and provide suggestions. We present a prototype implementation of the proposed method, EdIt, that can handle a broad range of errors. Promising results are illustrated with three common types of errors in nonnative writing. 1</p><p>5 0.7642566 <a title="196-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Query_Weighting_for_Ranking_Model_Adaptation.html">256 acl-2011-Query Weighting for Ranking Model Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Peng Cai ; Wei Gao ; Aoying Zhou ; Kam-Fai Wong</p><p>Abstract: We propose to directly measure the importance of queries in the source domain to the target domain where no rank labels of documents are available, which is referred to as query weighting. Query weighting is a key step in ranking model adaptation. As the learning object of ranking algorithms is divided by query instances, we argue that it’s more reasonable to conduct importance weighting at query level than document level. We present two query weighting schemes. The first compresses the query into a query feature vector, which aggregates all document instances in the same query, and then conducts query weighting based on the query feature vector. This method can efficiently estimate query importance by compressing query data, but the potential risk is information loss resulted from the compression. The second measures the similarity between the source query and each target query, and then combines these fine-grained similarity values for its importance estimation. Adaptation experiments on LETOR3.0 data set demonstrate that query weighting significantly outperforms document instance weighting methods.</p><p>6 0.68857121 <a title="196-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Extending_the_Entity_Grid_with_Entity-Specific_Features.html">129 acl-2011-Extending the Entity Grid with Entity-Specific Features</a></p>

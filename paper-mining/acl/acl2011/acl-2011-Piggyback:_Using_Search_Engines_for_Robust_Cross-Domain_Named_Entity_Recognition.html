<p>Author: Bo Pang ; Ravi Kumar</p><p>Abstract: Web search is an information-seeking activity. Often times, this amounts to a user seeking answers to a question. However, queries, which encode user’s information need, are typically not expressed as full-length natural language sentences in particular, as questions. Rather, they consist of one or more text fragments. As humans become more searchengine-savvy, do natural-language questions still have a role to play in web search? Through a systematic, large-scale study, we find to our surprise that as time goes by, web users are more likely to use questions to express their search intent. —</p><p>3 0.23585699 <a title="246-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Joint_Annotation_of_Search_Queries.html">182 acl-2011-Joint Annotation of Search Queries</a></p>

Due to their brevity and idiosyncratic structure, search queries pose a challenge to existing NLP tools. To address this challenge, we propose a probabilistic approach for performing joint query annotation. First, we derive a robust set of unsupervised independent annotations, using queries and pseudo-relevance feedback. Then, we stack additional classifiers on the independent annotations, and exploit the dependencies between them to further improve the accuracy, even with a very limited amount of available training data. We evaluate our method using a range of queries extracted from a web search log. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our approach for both short keyword queries, and verbose natural language queries.</p><p>4 0.18524513 <a title="246-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Query_Weighting_for_Ranking_Model_Adaptation.html">256 acl-2011-Query Weighting for Ranking Model Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Peng Cai ; Wei Gao ; Aoying Zhou ; Kam-Fai Wong</p><p>Abstract: We propose to directly measure the importance of queries in the source domain to the target domain where no rank labels of documents are available, which is referred to as query weighting. Query weighting is a key step in ranking model adaptation. As the learning object of ranking algorithms is divided by query instances, we argue that it’s more reasonable to conduct importance weighting at query level than document level. We present two query weighting schemes. The first compresses the query into a query feature vector, which aggregates all document instances in the same query, and then conducts query weighting based on the query feature vector. This method can efficiently estimate query importance by compressing query data, but the potential risk is information loss resulted from the compression. The second measures the similarity between the source query and each target query, and then combines these fine-grained similarity values for its importance estimation. Adaptation experiments on LETOR3.0 data set demonstrate that query weighting significantly outperforms document instance weighting methods.</p><p>5 0.17935425 <a title="246-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Recognizing_Named_Entities_in_Tweets.html">261 acl-2011-Recognizing Named Entities in Tweets</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaohua LIU ; Shaodian ZHANG ; Furu WEI ; Ming ZHOU</p><p>Abstract: The challenges of Named Entities Recognition (NER) for tweets lie in the insufficient information in a tweet and the unavailability of training data. We propose to combine a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier with a linear Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model under a semi-supervised learning framework to tackle these challenges. The KNN based classifier conducts pre-labeling to collect global coarse evidence across tweets while the CRF model conducts sequential labeling to capture fine-grained information encoded in a tweet. The semi-supervised learning plus the gazetteers alleviate the lack of training data. Extensive experiments show the advantages of our method over the baselines as well as the effectiveness of KNN and semisupervised learning.</p><p>6 0.17602339 <a title="246-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Ranking_Class_Labels_Using_Query_Sessions.html">258 acl-2011-Ranking Class Labels Using Query Sessions</a></p>

<p>Author: Patrick Pantel ; Ariel Fuxman</p><p>Abstract: We propose methods for estimating the probability that an entity from an entity database is associated with a web search query. Association is modeled using a query entity click graph, blending general query click logs with vertical query click logs. Smoothing techniques are proposed to address the inherent data sparsity in such graphs, including interpolation using a query synonymy model. A large-scale empirical analysis of the smoothing techniques, over a 2-year click graph collected from a commercial search engine, shows significant reductions in modeling error. The association models are then applied to the task of recommending products to web queries, by annotating queries with products from a large catalog and then mining query- product associations through web search session analysis. Experimental analysis shows that our smoothing techniques improve coverage while keeping precision stable, and overall, that our top-performing model affects 9% of general web queries with 94% precision.</p><p>3 0.78584981 <a title="246-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-Search_in_the_Lost_Sense_of_%22Query%22%3A_Question_Formulation_in_Web_Search_Queries_and_its_Temporal_Changes.html">271 acl-2011-Search in the Lost Sense of "Query": Question Formulation in Web Search Queries and its Temporal Changes</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhuowei Bao ; Benny Kimelfeld ; Yunyao Li</p><p>Abstract: Spelling correction for keyword-search queries is challenging in restricted domains such as personal email (or desktop) search, due to the scarcity of query logs, and due to the specialized nature of the domain. For that task, this paper presents an algorithm that is based on statistics from the corpus data (rather than the query log). This algorithm, which employs a simple graph-based approach, can incorporate different types of data sources with different levels of reliability (e.g., email subject vs. email body), and can handle complex spelling errors like splitting and merging of words. An experimental study shows the superiority of the algorithm over existing alternatives in the email domain.</p><p>5 0.76667923 <a title="246-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Joint_Annotation_of_Search_Queries.html">182 acl-2011-Joint Annotation of Search Queries</a></p>

The system aims to help users better understand the terms under which they are providing their informed consent. ConsentCanvas receives unstructured text documents as input and uses unsupervised natural language processing methods to embellish the source document using a linked stylesheet.

<p>Author: Nan Duan ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents hypothesis mixture decoding (HM decoding), a new decoding scheme that performs translation reconstruction using hypotheses generated by multiple translation systems. HM decoding involves two decoding stages: first, each component system decodes independently, with the explored search space kept for use in the next step; second, a new search space is constructed by composing existing hypotheses produced by all component systems using a set of rules provided by the HM decoder itself, and a new set of model independent features are used to seek the final best translation from this new search space. Few assumptions are made by our approach about the underlying component systems, enabling us to leverage SMT models based on arbitrary paradigms. We compare our approach with several related techniques, and demonstrate significant BLEU improvements in large-scale Chinese-to-English translation tasks.</p><p>4 0.7489568 <a title="246-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-IMASS%3A_An_Intelligent_Microblog_Analysis_and_Summarization_System.html">156 acl-2011-IMASS: An Intelligent Microblog Analysis and Summarization System</a></p>

We introduce a novel two-phase summarization scheme. In the first phase, the post plus its responses are classified into four categories based on the intention, interrogation, sharing, discussion and chat. For each type of post, in the second phase, we exploit different strategies, including opinion analysis, response pair identification, and response relevancy detection, to summarize and highlight critical information to display. This system provides an alternative thinking about machinesummarization: by utilizing AI approaches, computers are capable of constructing deeper and more user-friendly abstraction. 1</p><p>5 0.74830431 <a title="246-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Social_Network_Extraction_from_Texts%3A_A_Thesis_Proposal.html">286 acl-2011-Social Network Extraction from Texts: A Thesis Proposal</a></p>
<p>Author: Apoorv Agarwal</p><p>Abstract: In my thesis, Ipropose to build a system that would enable extraction of social interactions from texts. To date Ihave defined a comprehensive set of social events and built a preliminary system that extracts social events from news articles. Iplan to improve the performance of my current system by incorporating semantic information. Using domain adaptation techniques, Ipropose to apply my system to a wide range of genres. By extracting linguistic constructs relevant to social interactions, I will be able to empirically analyze different kinds of linguistic constructs that people use to express social interactions. Lastly, I will attempt to make convolution kernels more scalable and interpretable.</p><p>6 0.74606127 <a title="246-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Lexically-Triggered_Hidden_Markov_Models_for_Clinical_Document_Coding.html">209 acl-2011-Lexically-Triggered Hidden Markov Models for Clinical Document Coding</a></p>

<p>Author: Rafael E. Banchs ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: This work introduces AM-FM, a semantic framework for machine translation evaluation. Based upon this framework, a new evaluation metric, which is able to operate without the need for reference translations, is implemented and evaluated. The metric is based on the concepts of adequacy and fluency, which are independently assessed by using a cross-language latent semantic indexing approach and an n-gram based language model approach, respectively. Comparative analyses with conventional evaluation metrics are conducted on two different evaluation tasks (overall quality assessment and comparative ranking) over a large collection of human evaluations involving five European languages. Finally, the main pros and cons of the proposed framework are discussed along with future research directions. 1</p><p>3 0.25249058 <a title="49-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-MEANT%3A_An_inexpensive%2C_high-accuracy%2C_semi-automatic_metric_for_evaluating_translation_utility_based_on_semantic_roles.html">216 acl-2011-MEANT: An inexpensive, high-accuracy, semi-automatic metric for evaluating translation utility based on semantic roles</a></p>
<p>Author: Chi-kiu Lo ; Dekai Wu</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel semi-automated metric, MEANT, that assesses translation utility by matching semantic role fillers, producing scores that correlate with human judgment as well as HTER but at much lower labor cost. As machine translation systems improve in lexical choice and fluency, the shortcomings of widespread n-gram based, fluency-oriented MT evaluation metrics such as BLEU, which fail to properly evaluate adequacy, become more apparent. But more accurate, nonautomatic adequacy-oriented MT evaluation metrics like HTER are highly labor-intensive, which bottlenecks the evaluation cycle. We first show that when using untrained monolingual readers to annotate semantic roles in MT output, the non-automatic version of the metric HMEANT achieves a 0.43 correlation coefficient with human adequacyjudgments at the sentence level, far superior to BLEU at only 0.20, and equal to the far more expensive HTER. We then replace the human semantic role annotators with automatic shallow semantic parsing to further automate the evaluation metric, and show that even the semiautomated evaluation metric achieves a 0.34 correlation coefficient with human adequacy judgment, which is still about 80% as closely correlated as HTER despite an even lower labor cost for the evaluation procedure. The results show that our proposed metric is significantly better correlated with human judgment on adequacy than current widespread automatic evaluation metrics, while being much more cost effective than HTER. 1</p><p>4 0.24262093 <a title="49-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-A_Stacked_Sub-Word_Model_for_Joint_Chinese_Word_Segmentation_and_Part-of-Speech_Tagging.html">27 acl-2011-A Stacked Sub-Word Model for Joint Chinese Word Segmentation and Part-of-Speech Tagging</a></p>
<p>Author: Weiwei Sun</p><p>Abstract: The large combined search space of joint word segmentation and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging makes efficient decoding very hard. As a result, effective high order features representing rich contexts are inconvenient to use. In this work, we propose a novel stacked subword model for this task, concerning both efficiency and effectiveness. Our solution is a two step process. First, one word-based segmenter, one character-based segmenter and one local character classifier are trained to produce coarse segmentation and POS information. Second, the outputs of the three predictors are merged into sub-word sequences, which are further bracketed and labeled with POS tags by a fine-grained sub-word tagger. The coarse-to-fine search scheme is effi- cient, while in the sub-word tagging step rich contextual features can be approximately derived. Evaluation on the Penn Chinese Treebank shows that our model yields improvements over the best system reported in the literature.</p><p>5 0.23947172 <a title="49-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Parsing_the_Internal_Structure_of_Words%3A_A_New_Paradigm_for_Chinese_Word_Segmentation.html">241 acl-2011-Parsing the Internal Structure of Words: A New Paradigm for Chinese Word Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongguo Li</p><p>Abstract: Lots of Chinese characters are very productive in that they can form many structured words either as prefixes or as suffixes. Previous research in Chinese word segmentation mainly focused on identifying only the word boundaries without considering the rich internal structures of many words. In this paper we argue that this is unsatisfying in many ways, both practically and theoretically. Instead, we propose that word structures should be recovered in morphological analysis. An elegant approach for doing this is given and the result is shown to be promising enough for encouraging further effort in this direction. Our probability model is trained with the Penn Chinese Treebank and actually is able to parse both word and phrase structures in a unified way. 1 Why Parse Word Structures? Research in Chinese word segmentation has progressed tremendously in recent years, with state of the art performing at around 97% in precision and recall (Xue, 2003; Gao et al., 2005; Zhang and Clark, 2007; Li and Sun, 2009). However, virtually all these systems focus exclusively on recognizing the word boundaries, giving no consideration to the internal structures of many words. Though it has been the standard practice for many years, we argue that this paradigm is inadequate both in theory and in practice, for at least the following four reasons. The first reason is that if we confine our definition of word segmentation to the identification of word boundaries, then people tend to have divergent 1405 opinions as to whether a linguistic unit is a word or not (Sproat et al., 1996). This has led to many different annotation standards for Chinese word segmentation. Even worse, this could cause inconsistency in the same corpus. For instance, 䉂 擌 奒 ‘vice president’ is considered to be one word in the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005), but is split into two words by the Peking University corpus in the SIGHAN Bakeoffs (Sproat and Emerson, 2003). Meanwhile, 䉂 䀓 惼 ‘vice director’ and 䉂 䚲䡮 ‘deputy are both segmented into two words in the same Penn Chinese Treebank. In fact, all these words are composed of the prefix 䉂 ‘vice’ and a root word. Thus the structure of 䉂擌奒 ‘vice president’ can be represented with the tree in Figure 1. Without a doubt, there is complete agree- manager’ NN ,,ll JJf NNf 䉂 擌奒 Figure 1: Example of a word with internal structure. ment on the correctness of this structure among native Chinese speakers. So if instead of annotating only word boundaries, we annotate the structures of every word, then the annotation tends to be more 1 1Here it is necessary to add a note on terminology used in this paper. Since there is no universally accepted definition of the “word” concept in linguistics and especially in Chinese, whenever we use the term “word” we might mean a linguistic unit such as 䉂 擌奒 ‘vice president’ whose structure is shown as the tree in Figure 1, or we might mean a smaller unit such as 擌奒 ‘president’ which is a substructure of that tree. Hopefully, ProceedingPso orftla thned 4,9 Otrhe Agonnn,u Jauln Mee 1e9t-i2ng4, o 2f0 t1h1e.

The second reason is applications have different requirements for granularity of words. Take the personal name 撱 嗤吼 ‘Zhou Shuren’ as an example. It’s considered to be one word in the Penn Chinese Treebank, but is segmented into a surname and a given name in the Peking University corpus. For some applications such as information extraction, the former segmentation is adequate, while for others like machine translation, the later finer-grained output is more preferable. If the analyzer can produce a structure as shown in Figure 4(a), then every application can extract what it needs from this tree. A solution with tree output like this is more elegant than approaches which try to meet the needs of different applications in post-processing (Gao et al., 2004). The third reason is that traditional word segmentation has problems in handling many phenomena in Chinese. For example, the telescopic compound 㦌 撥 怂惆 ‘universities, middle schools and primary schools’ is in fact composed ofthree coordinating elements 㦌惆 ‘university’, 撥 惆 ‘middle school’ and 怂惆 ‘primary school’ . Regarding it as one flat word loses this important information. Another example is separable words like 扩 扙 ‘swim’ . With a linear segmentation, the meaning of ‘swimming’ as in 扩 堑 扙 ‘after swimming’ cannot be properly represented, since 扩扙 ‘swim’ will be segmented into discontinuous units. These language usages lie at the boundary between syntax and morphology, and are not uncommon in Chinese. They can be adequately represented with trees (Figure 2).

The last reason why we should care about word the context will always make it clear what is being referred to with the term “word”. 1406 structures is related to head driven statistical parsers (Collins, 2003). To illustrate this, note that in the Penn Chinese Treebank, the word 戽 䊂䠽 吼 ‘English People’ does not occur at all. Hence constituents headed by such words could cause some difficulty for head driven models in which out-ofvocabulary words need to be treated specially both when they are generated and when they are conditioned upon. But this word is in turn headed by its suffix 吼 ‘people’, and there are 2,233 such words in Penn Chinese Treebank. If we annotate the structure of every compound containing this suffix (e.g. Figure 3), such data sparsity simply goes away.</p><p>6 0.21649861 <a title="49-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Using_Bilingual_Information_for_Cross-Language_Document_Summarization.html">326 acl-2011-Using Bilingual Information for Cross-Language Document Summarization</a></p>

<p>Author: Yabin Zheng ; Lixing Xie ; Zhiyuan Liu ; Maosong Sun ; Yang Zhang ; Liyun Ru</p><p>Abstract: Chinese Pinyin input method is very important for Chinese language information processing. Users may make errors when they are typing in Chinese words. In this paper, we are concerned with the reasons that cause the errors. Inspired by the observation that pressing backspace is one of the most common user behaviors to modify the errors, we collect 54, 309, 334 error-correction pairs from a realworld data set that contains 2, 277, 786 users via backspace operations. In addition, we present a comparative analysis of the data to achieve a better understanding of users’ input behaviors. Comparisons with English typos suggest that some language-specific properties result in a part of Chinese input errors. 1</p><p>3 0.67145598 <a title="49-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-AM-FM%3A_A_Semantic_Framework_for_Translation_Quality_Assessment.html">2 acl-2011-AM-FM: A Semantic Framework for Translation Quality Assessment</a></p>

However, since the space of potential segmentations grows exponentially with the length of the corpus, no tractable algorithm follows directly from the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. Therefore, it is necessary to generate a set of candidate segmentations and select between them according to the MDL principle. We evaluate several algorithms for generating these candidate segmentations on a range of natural language corpora, and show that the Bootstrapped Voting Experts algorithm consistently outperforms other methods when paired with MDL.</p><p>6 0.63425821 <a title="49-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-MACAON_An_NLP_Tool_Suite_for_Processing_Word_Lattices.html">215 acl-2011-MACAON An NLP Tool Suite for Processing Word Lattices</a></p>

<p>Author: Maoxi Li ; Chengqing Zong ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: Word is usually adopted as the smallest unit in most tasks of Chinese language processing. However, for automatic evaluation of the quality of Chinese translation output when translating from other languages, either a word-level approach or a character-level approach is possible. So far, there has been no detailed study to compare the correlations of these two approaches with human assessment. In this paper, we compare word-level metrics with characterlevel metrics on the submitted output of English-to-Chinese translation systems in the IWSLT’08 CT-EC and NIST’08 EC tasks. Our experimental results reveal that character-level metrics correlate with human assessment better than word-level metrics. Our analysis suggests several key reasons behind this finding. 1</p><p>2 0.76677161 <a title="49-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Semantic_Representation_of_Negation_Using_Focus_Detection.html">273 acl-2011-Semantic Representation of Negation Using Focus Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Eduardo Blanco ; Dan Moldovan</p><p>Abstract: Negation is present in all human languages and it is used to reverse the polarity of part of statements that are otherwise affirmative by default. A negated statement often carries positive implicit meaning, but to pinpoint the positive part from the negative part is rather difficult. This paper aims at thoroughly representing the semantics of negation by revealing implicit positive meaning. The proposed representation relies on focus of negation detection. For this, new annotation over PropBank and a learning algorithm are proposed.</p><p>3 0.76455641 <a title="49-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Translating_from_Morphologically_Complex_Languages%3A_A_Paraphrase-Based_Approach.html">310 acl-2011-Translating from Morphologically Complex Languages: A Paraphrase-Based Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Preslav Nakov ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach to translating from a morphologically complex language. Unlike previous research, which has targeted word inflections and concatenations, we focus on the pairwise relationship between morphologically related words, which we treat as potential paraphrases and handle using paraphrasing techniques at the word, phrase, and sentence level. An important advantage of this framework is that it can cope with derivational morphology, which has so far remained largely beyond the capabilities of statistical machine translation systems. Our experiments translating from Malay, whose morphology is mostly derivational, into English show signif- icant improvements over rivaling approaches based on five automatic evaluation measures (for 320,000 sentence pairs; 9.5 million English word tokens).</p><p>4 0.65410149 <a title="49-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Word_Alignment_Combination_over_Multiple_Word_Segmentation.html">339 acl-2011-Word Alignment Combination over Multiple Word Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ning Xi ; Guangchao Tang ; Boyuan Li ; Yinggong Zhao</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a new word alignment combination approach on language pairs where one language has no explicit word boundaries. Instead of combining word alignments of different models (Xiang et al., 2010), we try to combine word alignments over multiple monolingually motivated word segmentation. Our approach is based on link confidence score defined over multiple segmentations, thus the combined alignment is more robust to inappropriate word segmentation. Our combination algorithm is simple, efficient, and easy to implement. In the Chinese-English experiment, our approach effectively improved word alignment quality as well as translation performance on all segmentations simultaneously, which showed that word alignment can benefit from complementary knowledge due to the diversity of multiple and monolingually motivated segmentations. 1</p><p>5 0.65162396 <a title="49-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Towards_a_Framework_for_Abstractive_Summarization_of_Multimodal_Documents.html">308 acl-2011-Towards a Framework for Abstractive Summarization of Multimodal Documents</a></p>
<p>Author: Charles Greenbacker</p><p>Abstract: We propose a framework for generating an abstractive summary from a semantic model of a multimodal document. We discuss the type of model required, the means by which it can be constructed, how the content of the model is rated and selected, and the method of realizing novel sentences for the summary. To this end, we introduce a metric called information density used for gauging the importance of content obtained from text and graphical sources.</p><p>6 0.6465444 <a title="49-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Monolingual_Alignment_by_Edit_Rate_Computation_on_Sentential_Paraphrase_Pairs.html">225 acl-2011-Monolingual Alignment by Edit Rate Computation on Sentential Paraphrase Pairs</a></p>

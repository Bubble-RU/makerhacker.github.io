<p>Author: Omar F. Zaidan ; Chris Callison-Burch</p><p>Abstract: Naively collecting translations by crowdsourcing the task to non-professional translators yields disfluent, low-quality results if no quality control is exercised. We demonstrate a variety of mechanisms that increase the translation quality to near professional levels. Specifically, we solicit redundant translations and edits to them, and automatically select the best output among them. We propose a set of features that model both the translations and the translators, such as country of residence, LM perplexity of the translation, edit rate from the other translations, and (optionally) calibration against professional translators. Using these features to score the collected translations, we are able to discriminate between acceptable and unacceptable translations. We recreate the NIST 2009 Urdu-toEnglish evaluation set with Mechanical Turk, and quantitatively show that our models are able to select translations within the range of quality that we expect from professional trans- lators. The total cost is more than an order of magnitude lower than professional translation.</p><p>3 0.18285282 <a title="81-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Two_Easy_Improvements_to_Lexical_Weighting.html">313 acl-2011-Two Easy Improvements to Lexical Weighting</a></p>

<p>Author: Emmanuel Prochasson ; Pascale Fung</p><p>Abstract: We present a first known result of high precision rare word bilingual extraction from comparable corpora, using aligned comparable documents and supervised classification. We incorporate two features, a context-vector similarity and a co-occurrence model between words in aligned documents in a machine learning approach. We test our hypothesis on different pairs of languages and corpora. We obtain very high F-Measure between 80% and 98% for recognizing and extracting correct translations for rare terms (from 1to 5 occurrences). Moreover, we show that our system can be trained on a pair of languages and test on a different pair of languages, obtaining a F-Measure of 77% for the classification of Chinese-English translations using a training corpus of Spanish-French. Our method is therefore even potentially applicable to low resources languages without training data.</p><p>5 0.17598656 <a title="81-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-MEANT%3A_An_inexpensive%2C_high-accuracy%2C_semi-automatic_metric_for_evaluating_translation_utility_based_on_semantic_roles.html">216 acl-2011-MEANT: An inexpensive, high-accuracy, semi-automatic metric for evaluating translation utility based on semantic roles</a></p>
<p>Author: Chi-kiu Lo ; Dekai Wu</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel semi-automated metric, MEANT, that assesses translation utility by matching semantic role fillers, producing scores that correlate with human judgment as well as HTER but at much lower labor cost. As machine translation systems improve in lexical choice and fluency, the shortcomings of widespread n-gram based, fluency-oriented MT evaluation metrics such as BLEU, which fail to properly evaluate adequacy, become more apparent. But more accurate, nonautomatic adequacy-oriented MT evaluation metrics like HTER are highly labor-intensive, which bottlenecks the evaluation cycle. We first show that when using untrained monolingual readers to annotate semantic roles in MT output, the non-automatic version of the metric HMEANT achieves a 0.43 correlation coefficient with human adequacyjudgments at the sentence level, far superior to BLEU at only 0.20, and equal to the far more expensive HTER. We then replace the human semantic role annotators with automatic shallow semantic parsing to further automate the evaluation metric, and show that even the semiautomated evaluation metric achieves a 0.34 correlation coefficient with human adequacy judgment, which is still about 80% as closely correlated as HTER despite an even lower labor cost for the evaluation procedure. The results show that our proposed metric is significantly better correlated with human judgment on adequacy than current widespread automatic evaluation metrics, while being much more cost effective than HTER. 1</p><p>6 0.16590059 <a title="81-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Phrase-Based_Translation_Model_for_Question_Retrieval_in_Community_Question_Answer_Archives.html">245 acl-2011-Phrase-Based Translation Model for Question Retrieval in Community Question Answer Archives</a></p>

<p>Author: Moshe Koppel ; Noam Ordan</p><p>Abstract: While it is has often been observed that the product of translation is somehow different than non-translated text, scholars have emphasized two distinct bases for such differences. Some have noted interference from the source language spilling over into translation in a source-language-specific way, while others have noted general effects of the process of translation that are independent of source language. Using a series of text categorization experiments, we show that both these effects exist and that, moreover, there is a continuum between them. There are many effects of translation that are consistent among texts translated from a given source language, some of which are consistent even among texts translated from families of source languages. Significantly, we find that even for widely unrelated source languages and multiple genres, differences between translated texts and non-translated texts are sufficient for a learned classifier to accurately determine if a given text is translated or original.</p><p>4 0.85299075 <a title="81-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Two_Easy_Improvements_to_Lexical_Weighting.html">313 acl-2011-Two Easy Improvements to Lexical Weighting</a></p>

<p>Author: Vishal Goyal ; Gurpreet Singh Lehal</p><p>Abstract: Hindi-Punjabi being closely related language pair (Goyal V. and Lehal G.S., 2008) , Hybrid Machine Translation approach has been used for developing Hindi to Punjabi Machine Translation System. Non-availability of lexical resources, spelling variations in the source language text, source text ambiguous words, named entity recognition and collocations are the major challenges faced while developing this syetm. The key activities involved during translation process are preprocessing, translation engine and post processing. Lookup algorithms, pattern matching algorithms etc formed the basis for solving these issues. The system accuracy has been evaluated using intelligibility test, accuracy test and BLEU score. The hybrid syatem is found to perform better than the constituent systems. Keywords: Machine Translation, Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing, Hindi, Punjabi. Translate Hindi to Punjabi, Closely related languages. 1Introduction Machine Translation system is a software designed that essentially takes a text in one language (called the source language), and translates it into another language (called the target language). There are number of approaches for MT like Direct based, Transform based, Interlingua based, Statistical etc. But the choice of approach depends upon the available resources and the kind of languages involved. In general, if the two languages are structurally similar, in particular as regards lexical correspondences, morphology and word order, the case for abstract syntactic analysis seems less convincing. Since the present research work deals with a pair of closely related language 1 Gurpreet Singh Lehal Department of Computer Science Punjabi University, Patiala,India gs lehal @ gmai l com . i.e. Hindi-Punjabi , thus direct word-to-word translation approach is the obvious choice. As some rule based approach has also been used, thus, Hybrid approach has been adopted for developing the system. An exhaustive survey has already been given for existing machine translations systems developed so far mentioning their accuracies and limitations. (Goyal V. and Lehal G.S., 2009). 2 System Architecture 2.1 Pre Processing Phase The preprocessing stage is a collection of operations that are applied on input data to make it processable by the translation engine. In the first phase of Machine Translation system, various activities incorporated include text normalization, replacing collocations and replacing proper nouns. 2.2 Text Normalization The variety in the alphabet, different dialects and influence of foreign languages has resulted in spelling variations of the same word. Such variations sometimes can be treated as errors in writing. (Goyal V. and Lehal G.S., 2010). 2.3 Replacing Collocations After passing the input text through text normalization, the text passes through this Collocation replacement sub phase of Preprocessing phase. Collocation is two or more consecutive words with a special behavior. (Choueka :1988). For example, the collocation उ?र ?देश (uttar pradēsh) if translated word to word, will be translated as ਜਵਾਬ ਰਾਜ (javāb rāj) but it must be translated as ਉ?ਤਰ ਪ?ਦਸ਼ੇ (uttar pradēsh). The accuracy of the results for collocation extraction using t-test is not accurate and includes number of such bigrams and trigrams that are not actually collocations. Thus, manually such entries were removed and actual collocations were further extracted. The Portland, POrroecgeoend,in UgSsA o,f 2 t1he Ju AnCeL 2-0H1L1T. 2 ?c 021101 S1y Astessmoc Diaetmioonn fsotr a Ctioonms,p puatagteiosn 1a–l6 L,inguistics correct corresponding Punjabi translation for each extracted collocation is stored in the collocation table of the database. The collocation table of the database consists of 5000 such entries. In this sub phase, the normalized input text is analyzed. Each collocation in the database found in the input text will be replaced with the Punjabi translation of the corresponding collocation. It is found that when tested on a corpus containing about 1,00,000 words, only 0.001 % collocations were found and replaced during the translation. Hindi Text Figure 1: Overview of Hindi-Punjabi Machine Translation System 2.4 Replacing Proper Nouns A great proposition of unseen words includes proper nouns like personal, days of month, days of week, country names, city names, bank fastens words proper decide the translation process. Once these are recognized and stored into the noun database, there is no need to about their translation or transliteration names, organization names, ocean names, river every names, university words names etc. and if translated time in the case of presence in word to word, their meaning is changed. If the gazetteer meaning is not affected, even though this step fast. This input makes list text for the translation is self of such translation. growing This accurate and during each 2 translation. Thus, to process this sub phase, the system requires a proper noun gazetteer that has been complied offline. For this task, we have developed an offline module to extract proper nouns from the corpus based on some rules. Also, Named Entity recognition module has been developed based on the CRF approach (Sharma R. and Goyal V., 2011b). 2.5 Tokenizer Tokenizers (also known as lexical analyzers or word segmenters) segment a stream of characters into meaningful units called tokens. The tokenizer takes the text generated by pre processing phase as input. Individual words or tokens are extracted and processed to generate its equivalent in the target language. This module, using space, a punctuation mark, as delimiter, extracts tokens (word) one by one from the text and gives it to translation engine for analysis till the complete input text is read and processed. 2.6 Translation Engine The translation engine is the main component of our Machine Translation system. It takes token generated by the tokenizer as input and outputs the translated token in the target language. These translated tokens are concatenated one after another along with the delimiter. Modules included in this phase are explained below one by one. 2.6.1 Identifying Titles and Surnames Title may be defined as a formal appellation attached to the name of a person or family by virtue of office, rank, hereditary privilege, noble birth, or attainment or used as a mark of respect. Thus word next to title and word previous to surname is usually a proper noun. And sometimes, a word used as proper name of a person has its own meaning in target language. Similarly, Surname may be defined as a name shared in common to identify the members of a family, as distinguished from each member's given name. It is also called family name or last name. When either title or surname is passed through the translation engine, it is translated by the system. This cause the system failure as these proper names should be transliterated instead of translation. For example consider the Hindi sentence 3 ?ीमान हष? जी हमार ेयहाँ पधार।े (shrīmān harsh jī हष? hamārē yahāṃ padhārē). In this sentence, (harsh) has the meaning “joy”. The equivalent translation of हष? (harsh) in target language is ਖੁਸ਼ੀ (khushī). Similarly, consider the Hindi sentence ?काश ?सह हमार े (prakāsh siṃh hamārē yahāṃ padhārē). Here, ?काश (prakāsh) word is acting as proper noun and it must be transliterated and not translated because (siṃh) is surname and word previous to it is proper noun. Thus, a small module has been developed for यहाँ पधार।े. ?सह locating such proper nouns to consider them as title or surname. There is one special character ‘॰’ in Devanagari script to mark the symbols like डा॰, ?ो॰. If this module found this symbol to be title or surname, the word next and previous to this token as the case may be for title or surname respectively, will be transliterated not translated. The title and surname database consists of 14 and 654 entries respectively. These databases can be extended at any time to allow new titles and surnames to be added. This module was tested on a large Hindi corpus and showed that about 2-5 % text of the input text depending upon its domain is proper noun. Thus, this module plays an important role in translation. 2.6.2 Hindi Morphological analyzer This module finds the root word for the token and its morphological features.Morphological analyzer developed by IIT-H has been ported for Windows platform for making it usable for this system. (Goyal V. and Lehal G.S.,2008a) 2.6.3 Word-to-Word translation using lexicon lookup If token is not a title or a surname, it is looked up in the HPDictionary database containing Hindi to Punjabi direct word to word translation. If it is found, it is used for translation. If no entry is found in HPDictionary database, it is sent to next sub phase for processing. The HPDictionary database consists of 54, 127 entries.This database can be extended at any time to allow new entries in the dictionary to be added. 2.6.4 Resolving Ambiguity Among number of approaches for disambiguation, the most appropriate approach to determine the correct meaning of a Hindi word in a particular usage for our Machine Translation system is to examine its context using N-gram approach. After analyzing the past experiences of various authors, we have chosen the value of n to be 3 and 2 i.e. trigram and bigram approaches respectively for our system. Trigrams are further categorized into three different types. First category of trigram consists of context one word previous to and one word next to the ambiguous word. Second category of trigram consists of context of two adjacent previous words to the ambiguous word. Third category of the trigram consists of context of two adjacent next words to the ambiguous word. Bigrams are also categorized into two categories. First category of the bigrams consists of context of one previous word to ambiguous word and second category of the bigrams consists of one context word next to ambiguous word. For this purpose, the Hindi corpus consisting of about 2 million words was collected from different sources like online newspaper daily news, blogs, Prem Chand stories, Yashwant jain stories, articles etc. The most common list of ambiguous words was found. We have found a list of 75 ambiguous words out of which the most are स े sē and aur. (Goyal V. and frequent Lehal G.S., 2011) और 2.6.5 Handling Unknown Words 2.6.5.1 Word Inflectional Analysis and generation In linguistics, a suffix (also sometimes called a postfix or ending) is an affix which is placed after the stem of a word. Common examples are case endings, which indicate the grammatical case of nouns or adjectives, and verb endings. Hindi is a (relatively) free wordorder and highly inflectional language. Because of same origin, both languages have very similar structure and grammar. The difference is only in words and in pronunciation e.g. in Hindi it is लड़का and in Punjabi the word for boy is ਮੰੁਡਾ and even sometimes that is also not there like घर (ghar) and ਘਰ (ghar). The inflection forms of both these words in Hindi and Punjabi are also similar. In this activity, inflectional analysis without using morphology has been performed 4 for all those tokens that are not processed by morphological analysis module. Thus, for performing inflectional analysis, rule based approach has been followed. When the token is passed to this sub phase for inflectional analysis, If any pattern of the regular expression (inflection rule) matches with this token, that rule is applied on the token and its equivalent translation in Punjabi is generated based on the matched rule(s). There is also a check on the generated word for its correctness. We are using correct Punjabi words database for testing the correctness of the generated word. 2.6.5.2 Transliteration This module is beneficial for handling out-ofvocabulary words. For example the word िवशाल is as ਿਵਸ਼ਾਲ (vishāl) whereas translated as ਵੱਡਾ. There must be some method in every Machine Translation system for words like technical terms and (vishāl) transliterated proper names of persons, places, objects etc. that cannot be found in translation resources such as Hindi-Punjabi bilingual dictionary, surnames database, titles database etc and transliteration is an obvious choice for such words. (Goyal V. and Lehal G.S., 2009a). 2.7 Post-Processing 2.7.1 Agreement Corrections In spite of the great similarity between Hindi and Punjabi, there are still a number of important agreement divergences in gender and number. The output generated by the translation engine phase becomes the input for post-processing phase. This phase will correct the agreement errors based on the rules implemented in the form of regular expressions. (Goyal V. and Lehal G.S., 2011) 3 Evaluation and Results The evaluation document set consisted of documents from various online newspapers news, articles, blogs, biographies etc. This test bed consisted of 35500 words and was translated using our Machine Translation system. 3.1 Test Document For our Machine Translation system evaluation, we have used benchmark sampling method for selecting the set of sentences. Input sentences are selected from randomly selected news (sports, politics, world, regional, entertainment, travel etc.), articles (published by various writers, philosophers etc.), literature (stories by Prem Chand, Yashwant jain etc.), Official language for office letters (The Language Officially used on the files in Government offices) and blogs (Posted by general public in forums etc.). Care has been taken to ensure that sentences use a variety of constructs. All possible constructs including simple as well as complex ones are incorporated in the set. The sentence set also contains all types of sentences such as declarative, interrogative, imperative and exclamatory. Sentence length is not restricted although care has been taken that single sentences do not become too long. Following table shows the test data set: Table 1: Test data set for the evaluation of Hindi to Punjabi Machine Translation DTSWeo nctaruldenmscent 91DN03ae, 4wil0ys A5230,1rt6ic70lS4esytO0LQ38m6,1au5f4no9itg3c5e1uiaslgeB5130,lo6g50 L29105i,te84r05atue 3.2 Experiments It is also important to choose appropriate evaluators for our experiments. Thus, depending upon the requirements and need of the above mentioned tests, 50 People of different professions were selected for performing experiments. 20 Persons were from villages that only knew Punjabi and did not know Hindi and 30 persons were from different professions having knowledge of both Hindi and Punjabi. Average ratings for the sentences of the individual translations were then summed up (separately according to intelligibility and accuracy) to get the average scores. Percentage of accurate sentences and intelligent sentences was also calculated separately sentences. by counting the number of 3.2.1 Intelligibility Evaluation 5 The evaluators do not have any clue about the source language i.e. Hindi. They judge each sentence (in target language i.e. Punjabi) on the basis of its comprehensibility. The target user is a layman who is interested only in the comprehensibility of translations. Intelligibility is effected by grammatical errors, mistranslations, and un-translated words. 3.2.1.1 Results The response by the evaluators were analysed and following are the results: • 70.3 % sentences got the score 3 i.e. they were perfectly clear and intelligible. • 25. 1 % sentences got the score 2 i.e. they were generally clear and intelligible. • 3.5 % sentences got the score 1i.e. they were hard to understand. • 1. 1 % sentences got the score 0 i.e. they were not understandable. So we can say that about 95.40 % sentences are intelligible. These sentences are those which have score 2 or above. Thus, we can say that the direct approach can translate Hindi text to Punjabi Text with a consideably good accuracy. 3.2.2 Accuracy Evaluation / Fidelity Measure The evaluators are provided with source text along with translated text. A highly intelligible output sentence need not be a correct translation of the source sentence. It is important to check whether the meaning of the source language sentence is preserved in the translation. This property is called accuracy. 3.2.2.1 Results Initially Null Hypothesis is assumed i.e. the system’s performance is NULL. The author assumes that system is dumb and does not produce any valuable output. By the intelligibility of the analysis and Accuracy analysis, it has been proved wrong. The accuracy percentage for the system is found out to be 87.60% Further investigations reveal that out of 13.40%: • 80.6 % sentences achieve a match between 50 to 99% • 17.2 % of remaining sentences were marked with less than 50% match against the correct sentences. • Only 2.2 % sentences are those which are found unfaithful. A match of lower 50% does not mean that the sentences are not usable. After some post editing, they can fit properly in the translated text. (Goyal, V., Lehal, G.S., 2009b) 3.2.2 BLEU Score: As there is no Hindi –Parallel Corpus was available, thus for testing the system automatically, we generated Hindi-Parallel Corpus of about 10K Sentences. The BLEU score comes out to be 0.7801. 5 Conclusion In this paper, a hybrid translation approach for translating the text from Hindi to Punjabi has been presented. The proposed architecture has shown extremely good results and if found to be appropriate for MT systems between closely related language pairs.

<p>Author: Jinho D. Choi ; Martha Palmer</p><p>Abstract: This paper suggests two ways of improving transition-based, non-projective dependency parsing. First, we add a transition to an existing non-projective parsing algorithm, so it can perform either projective or non-projective parsing as needed. Second, we present a bootstrapping technique that narrows down discrepancies between gold-standard and automatic parses used as features. The new addition to the algorithm shows a clear advantage in parsing speed. The bootstrapping technique gives a significant improvement to parsing accuracy, showing near state-of-theart performance with respect to other parsing approaches evaluated on the same data set.</p><p>2 0.99628842 <a title="81-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Extracting_Comparative_Entities_and_Predicates_from_Texts_Using_Comparative_Type_Classification.html">130 acl-2011-Extracting Comparative Entities and Predicates from Texts Using Comparative Type Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Seon Yang ; Youngjoong Ko</p><p>Abstract: The automatic extraction of comparative information is an important text mining problem and an area of increasing interest. In this paper, we study how to build a Korean comparison mining system. Our work is composed of two consecutive tasks: 1) classifying comparative sentences into different types and 2) mining comparative entities and predicates. We perform various experiments to find relevant features and learning techniques. As a result, we achieve outstanding performance enough for practical use. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.99171555 <a title="81-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Consistent_Translation_using_Discriminative_Learning_-_A_Translation_Memory-inspired_Approach.html">81 acl-2011-Consistent Translation using Discriminative Learning - A Translation Memory-inspired Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Yanjun Ma ; Yifan He ; Andy Way ; Josef van Genabith</p><p>Abstract: We present a discriminative learning method to improve the consistency of translations in phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems. Our method is inspired by Translation Memory (TM) systems which are widely used by human translators in industrial settings. We constrain the translation of an input sentence using the most similar ‘translation example’ retrieved from the TM. Differently from previous research which used simple fuzzy match thresholds, these constraints are imposed using discriminative learning to optimise the translation performance. We observe that using this method can benefit the SMT system by not only producing consistent translations, but also improved translation outputs. We report a 0.9 point improvement in terms of BLEU score on English–Chinese technical documents.</p><p>4 0.99102312 <a title="81-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Learning_to_Transform_and_Select_Elementary_Trees_for_Improved_Syntax-based_Machine_Translations.html">206 acl-2011-Learning to Transform and Select Elementary Trees for Improved Syntax-based Machine Translations</a></p>
<p>Author: Bing Zhao ; Young-Suk Lee ; Xiaoqiang Luo ; Liu Li</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel technique of learning how to transform the source parse trees to improve the translation qualities of syntax-based translation models using synchronous context-free grammars. We transform the source tree phrasal structure into a set of simpler structures, expose such decisions to the decoding process, and find the least expensive transformation operation to better model word reordering. In particular, we integrate synchronous binarizations, verb regrouping, removal of redundant parse nodes, and incorporate a few important features such as translation boundaries. We learn the structural preferences from the data in a generative framework. The syntax-based translation system integrating the proposed techniques outperforms the best Arabic-English unconstrained system in NIST08 evaluations by 1.3 absolute BLEU, which is statistically significant.</p><p>5 0.98908758 <a title="81-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-The_Surprising_Variance_in_Shortest-Derivation_Parsing.html">300 acl-2011-The Surprising Variance in Shortest-Derivation Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohit Bansal ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We investigate full-scale shortest-derivation parsing (SDP), wherein the parser selects an analysis built from the fewest number of training fragments. Shortest derivation parsing exhibits an unusual range of behaviors. At one extreme, in the fully unpruned case, it is neither fast nor accurate. At the other extreme, when pruned with a coarse unlexicalized PCFG, the shortest derivation criterion becomes both fast and surprisingly effective, rivaling more complex weighted-fragment approaches. Our analysis includes an investigation of tie-breaking and associated dynamic programs. At its best, our parser achieves an accuracy of 87% F1 on the English WSJ task with minimal annotation, and 90% F1 with richer annotation.</p><p>6 0.98516268 <a title="81-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Automatic_Labelling_of_Topic_Models.html">52 acl-2011-Automatic Labelling of Topic Models</a></p>

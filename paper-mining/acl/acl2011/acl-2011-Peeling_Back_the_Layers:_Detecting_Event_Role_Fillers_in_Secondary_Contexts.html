<p>Author: Nathanael Chambers ; Dan Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: Standard algorithms for template-based information extraction (IE) require predefined template schemas, and often labeled data, to learn to extract their slot fillers (e.g., an embassy is the Target of a Bombing template). This paper describes an approach to template-based IE that removes this requirement and performs extraction without knowing the template structure in advance. Our algorithm instead learns the template structure automatically from raw text, inducing template schemas as sets of linked events (e.g., bombings include detonate, set off, and destroy events) associated with semantic roles. We also solve the standard IE task, using the induced syntactic patterns to extract role fillers from specific documents. We evaluate on the MUC-4 terrorism dataset and show that we induce template structure very similar to handcreated gold structure, and we extract role fillers with an F1 score of .40, approaching the performance of algorithms that require full knowledge of the templates.</p><p>3 0.20752846 <a title="244-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Can_Document_Selection_Help_Semi-supervised_Learning%3F_A_Case_Study_On_Event_Extraction.html">65 acl-2011-Can Document Selection Help Semi-supervised Learning?

<p>Author: Shasha Liao ; Ralph Grishman</p><p>Abstract: Annotating training data for event extraction is tedious and labor-intensive. Most current event extraction tasks rely on hundreds of annotated documents, but this is often not enough. In this paper, we present a novel self-training strategy, which uses Information Retrieval (IR) to collect a cluster of related documents as the resource for bootstrapping. Also, based on the particular characteristics of this corpus, global inference is applied to provide more confident and informative data selection. We compare this approach to self-training on a normal newswire corpus and show that IR can provide a better corpus for bootstrapping and that global inference can further improve instance selection. We obtain gains of 1.7% in trigger labeling and 2.3% in role labeling through IR and an additional 1.1% in trigger labeling and 1.3% in role labeling by applying global inference. 1</p><p>4 0.19009016 <a title="244-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Using_Cross-Entity_Inference_to_Improve_Event_Extraction.html">328 acl-2011-Using Cross-Entity Inference to Improve Event Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Yu Hong ; Jianfeng Zhang ; Bin Ma ; Jianmin Yao ; Guodong Zhou ; Qiaoming Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Event extraction is the task of detecting certain specified types of events that are mentioned in the source language data. The state-of-the-art research on the task is transductive inference (e.g. cross-event inference). In this paper, we propose a new method of event extraction by well using cross-entity inference. In contrast to previous inference methods, we regard entitytype consistency as key feature to predict event mentions. We adopt this inference method to improve the traditional sentence-level event extraction system. Experiments show that we can get 8.6% gain in trigger (event) identification, and more than 11.8% gain for argument (role) classification in ACE event extraction. 1</p><p>5 0.14944781 <a title="244-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Unsupervised_Semantic_Role_Induction_via_Split-Merge_Clustering.html">324 acl-2011-Unsupervised Semantic Role Induction via Split-Merge Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Gregory Brown</p><p>Abstract: Relation extraction in documents allows the detection of how entities being discussed in a document are related to one another (e.g. partof). This paper presents an analysis of a relation extraction system based on prior work but applied to the J.D. Power and Associates Sentiment Corpus to examine how the system works on documents from a range of social media. The results are examined on three different subsets of the JDPA Corpus, showing that the system performs much worse on documents from certain sources. The proposed explanation is that the features used are more appropriate to text with strong editorial standards than the informal writing style of blogs.</p><p>6 0.70159799 <a title="244-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-ConsentCanvas%3A_Automatic_Texturing_for_Improved_Readability_in_End-User_License_Agreements.html">80 acl-2011-ConsentCanvas: Automatic Texturing for Improved Readability in End-User License Agreements</a></p>

<p>Author: Tony Veale</p><p>Abstract: Information retrieval (IR) and figurative language processing (FLP) could scarcely be more different in their treatment of language and meaning. IR views language as an open-ended set of mostly stable signs with which texts can be indexed and retrieved, focusing more on a text’s potential relevance than its potential meaning. In contrast, FLP views language as a system of unstable signs that can be used to talk about the world in creative new ways. There is another key difference: IR is practical, scalable and robust, and in daily use by millions of casual users. FLP is neither scalable nor robust, and not yet practical enough to migrate beyond the lab. This paper thus presents a mutually beneficial hybrid of IR and FLP, one that enriches IR with new operators to enable the non-literal retrieval of creative expressions, and which also transplants FLP into a robust, scalable framework in which practical applications of linguistic creativity can be implemented. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.78335327 <a title="244-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Peeling_Back_the_Layers%3A_Detecting_Event_Role_Fillers_in_Secondary_Contexts.html">244 acl-2011-Peeling Back the Layers: Detecting Event Role Fillers in Secondary Contexts</a></p>

<p>Author: Yulan He ; Chenghua Lin ; Harith Alani</p><p>Abstract: Joint sentiment-topic (JST) model was previously proposed to detect sentiment and topic simultaneously from text. The only supervision required by JST model learning is domain-independent polarity word priors. In this paper, we modify the JST model by incorporating word polarity priors through modifying the topic-word Dirichlet priors. We study the polarity-bearing topics extracted by JST and show that by augmenting the original feature space with polarity-bearing topics, the in-domain supervised classifiers learned from augmented feature representation achieve the state-of-the-art performance of 95% on the movie review data and an average of 90% on the multi-domain sentiment dataset. Furthermore, using feature augmentation and selection according to the information gain criteria for cross-domain sentiment classification, our proposed approach performs either better or comparably compared to previous approaches. Nevertheless, our approach is much simpler and does not require difficult parameter tuning.</p><p>4 0.72303379 <a title="244-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Unsupervised_Semantic_Role_Induction_via_Split-Merge_Clustering.html">324 acl-2011-Unsupervised Semantic Role Induction via Split-Merge Clustering</a></p>

The method is simple, surprisingly effective, and allows to integrate linguistic knowledge transparently. By combining role induction with a rule-based component for argument identification we obtain an unsupervised end-to-end semantic role labeling system. Evaluation on the CoNLL 2008 benchmark dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms competitive unsupervised approaches by a wide margin.</p><p>5 0.719791 <a title="244-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Semi-Supervised_Frame-Semantic_Parsing_for_Unknown_Predicates.html">274 acl-2011-Semi-Supervised Frame-Semantic Parsing for Unknown Predicates</a></p>
<p>Author: Dipanjan Das ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We describe a new approach to disambiguating semantic frames evoked by lexical predicates previously unseen in a lexicon or annotated data. Our approach makes use of large amounts of unlabeled data in a graph-based semi-supervised learning framework. We construct a large graph where vertices correspond to potential predicates and use label propagation to learn possible semantic frames for new ones. The label-propagated graph is used within a frame-semantic parser and, for unknown predicates, results in over 15% absolute improvement in frame identification accuracy and over 13% absolute improvement in full frame-semantic parsing F1 score on a blind test set, over a state-of-the-art supervised baseline.</p><p>6 0.71787024 <a title="244-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Which_Noun_Phrases_Denote_Which_Concepts%3F.html">334 acl-2011-Which Noun Phrases Denote Which Concepts?</a></p>

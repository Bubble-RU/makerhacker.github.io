<p>Author: Michael Mohler ; Razvan Bunescu ; Rada Mihalcea</p><p>Abstract: In this work we address the task of computerassisted assessment of short student answers. We combine several graph alignment features with lexical semantic similarity measures using machine learning techniques and show that the student answers can be more accurately graded than if the semantic measures were used in isolation. We also present a first attempt to align the dependency graphs of the student and the instructor answers in order to make use of a structural component in the automatic grading of student answers.</p><p>3 0.13263844 <a title="341-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-A_New_Dataset_and_Method_for_Automatically_Grading_ESOL_Texts.html">20 acl-2011-A New Dataset and Method for Automatically Grading ESOL Texts</a></p>
<p>Author: Helen Yannakoudakis ; Ted Briscoe ; Ben Medlock</p><p>Abstract: We demonstrate how supervised discriminative machine learning techniques can be used to automate the assessment of ‘English as a Second or Other Language’ (ESOL) examination scripts. In particular, we use rank preference learning to explicitly model the grade relationships between scripts. A number of different features are extracted and ablation tests are used to investigate their contribution to overall performance. A comparison between regression and rank preference models further supports our method. Experimental results on the first publically available dataset show that our system can achieve levels of performance close to the upper bound for the task, as defined by the agreement between human examiners on the same corpus. Finally, using a set of ‘outlier’ texts, we test the validity of our model and identify cases where the model’s scores diverge from that of a human examiner.</p><p>4 0.12139115 <a title="341-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-AM-FM%3A_A_Semantic_Framework_for_Translation_Quality_Assessment.html">2 acl-2011-AM-FM: A Semantic Framework for Translation Quality Assessment</a></p>
<p>Author: Rafael E. Banchs ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: This work introduces AM-FM, a semantic framework for machine translation evaluation. Based upon this framework, a new evaluation metric, which is able to operate without the need for reference translations, is implemented and evaluated. The metric is based on the concepts of adequacy and fluency, which are independently assessed by using a cross-language latent semantic indexing approach and an n-gram based language model approach, respectively. Comparative analyses with conventional evaluation metrics are conducted on two different evaluation tasks (overall quality assessment and comparative ranking) over a large collection of human evaluations involving five European languages. Finally, the main pros and cons of the proposed framework are discussed along with future research directions. 1</p><p>5 0.11718421 <a title="341-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Latent_Semantic_Word_Sense_Induction_and_Disambiguation.html">198 acl-2011-Latent Semantic Word Sense Induction and Disambiguation</a></p>
<p>Author: Tim Van de Cruys ; Marianna Apidianaki</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified model for the automatic induction of word senses from text, and the subsequent disambiguation of particular word instances using the automatically extracted sense inventory. The induction step and the disambiguation step are based on the same principle: words and contexts are mapped to a limited number of topical dimensions in a latent semantic word space. The intuition is that a particular sense is associated with a particular topic, so that different senses can be discriminated through their association with particular topical dimensions; in a similar vein, a particular instance of a word can be disambiguated by determining its most important topical dimensions. The model is evaluated on the SEMEVAL-20 10 word sense induction and disambiguation task, on which it reaches stateof-the-art results.</p><p>6 0.10651462 <a title="341-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Towards_Tracking_Semantic_Change_by_Visual_Analytics.html">307 acl-2011-Towards Tracking Semantic Change by Visual Analytics</a></p>

<p>Author: Anja Belz ; Eric Kow</p><p>Abstract: Studies assessing rating scales are very common in psychology and related fields, but are rare in NLP. In this paper we assess discrete and continuous scales used for measuring quality assessments of computergenerated language. We conducted six separate experiments designed to investigate the validity, reliability, stability, interchangeability and sensitivity of discrete vs. continuous scales. We show that continuous scales are viable for use in language evaluation, and offer distinct advantages over discrete scales. 1 Background and Introduction Rating scales have been used for measuring human perception of various stimuli for a long time, at least since the early 20th century (Freyd, 1923). First used in psychology and psychophysics, they are now also common in a variety of other disciplines, including NLP. Discrete scales are the only type of scale commonly used for qualitative assessments of computer-generated language in NLP (e.g. in the DUC/TAC evaluation competitions). Continuous scales are commonly used in psychology and related fields, but are virtually unknown in NLP. While studies assessing the quality of individual scales and comparing different types of rating scales are common in psychology and related fields, such studies hardly exist in NLP, and so at present little is known about whether discrete scales are a suitable rating tool for NLP evaluation tasks, or whether continuous scales might provide a better alternative. A range of studies from sociology, psychophysiology, biometrics and other fields have compared 230 Kow} @bright on .ac .uk discrete and continuous scales. Results tend to differ for different types of data. E.g., results from pain measurement show a continuous scale to outperform a discrete scale (ten Klooster et al., 2006). Other results (Svensson, 2000) from measuring students’ ease of following lectures show a discrete scale to outperform a continuous scale. When measuring dyspnea, Lansing et al. (2003) found a hybrid scale to perform on a par with a discrete scale. Another consideration is the types of data produced by discrete and continuous scales. Parametric methods of statistical analysis, which are far more sensitive than non-parametric ones, are commonly applied to both discrete and continuous data. However, parametric methods make very strong assumptions about data, including that it is numerical and normally distributed (Siegel, 1957). If these assumptions are violated, then the significance of results is overestimated. Clearly, the numerical assumption does not hold for the categorial data produced by discrete scales, and it is unlikely to be normally distributed. Many researchers are happier to apply parametric methods to data from continuous scales, and some simply take it as read that such data is normally distributed (Lansing et al., 2003). Our aim in the present study was to systematically assess and compare discrete and continuous scales when used for the qualitative assessment of computer-generated language. We start with an overview of assessment scale types (Section 2). We describe the experiments we conducted (Sec- tion 4), the data we used in them (Section 3), and the properties we examined in our inter-scale comparisons (Section 5), before presenting our results Proceedings ofP thoer t4l9atnhd A, Onrnuegaoln M,e Jeuntineg 19 o-f2 t4h,e 2 A0s1s1o.c?i ac t2io0n11 fo Ar Cssoocmiaptuiotanti foonra Clo Lminpguutiastti ocns:aslh Loirntpgaupisetricss, pages 230–235, Q1: Grammaticality The summary should have no datelines, system-internal formatting, capitalization errors or obviously ungrammatical sentences (e.g., fragments, missing components) that make the text difficult to read. 1.

(Section 6), and some conclusions (Section 7). 2 Rating Scales With Verbal Descriptor Scales (VDSs), participants give responses on ordered lists of verbally described and/or numerically labelled response cate- gories, typically varying in number from 2 to 11 (Svensson, 2000). An example of a VDS used in NLP is shown in Figure 1. VDSs are used very widely in contexts where computationally generated language is evaluated, including in dialogue, summarisation, MT and data-to-text generation. Visual analogue scales (VASs) are far less common outside psychology and related areas than VDSs. Responses are given by selecting a point on a typically horizontal line (although vertical lines have also been used (Scott and Huskisson, 2003)), on which the two end points represent the extreme values of the variable to be measured. Such lines can be mono-polar or bi-polar, and the end points are labelled with an image (smiling/frowning face), or a brief verbal descriptor, to indicate which end of the line corresponds to which extreme of the variable. The labels are commonly chosen to represent a point beyond any response actually likely to be chosen by raters. There is only one examples of a VAS in NLP system evaluation that we are aware of (Gatt et al., 2009). Hybrid scales, known as a graphic rating scales, combine the features of VDSs and VASs, and are also used in psychology. Here, the verbal descriptors are aligned along the line of a VAS and the endpoints are typically unmarked (Svensson, 2000). We are aware of one example in NLP (Williams and Reiter, 2008); 231 Q1: Grammaticality The summary should have no datelines, system-internal formatting, capitalization errors or obviously ungrammatical sentences (e.g., fragments, missing components) that make the text difficult to read. extbreamdely excellent Figure 2: Evaluation of Grammaticality with alternative VAS scale (cf. Figure 1). Evaluation task for each summary text: evaluator selects a place on the line to represent quality of the summary in terms of the criterion. we did not investigate this scale in our study. We used the following two specific scale designs in our experiments: VDS-7: 7 response categories, numbered (7 = best) and verbally described (e.g. 7 = “perfectly fluent” for Fluency, and 7 = “perfectly clear” for Clarity). Response categories were presented in a vertical list, with the best category at the bottom. Each category had a tick-box placed next to it; the rater’s task was to tick the box by their chosen rating. VAS: a horizontal, bi-polar line, with no ticks on it, mapping to 0–100. In the image description tests, statements identified the left end as negative, the right end as positive; in the weather forecast tests, the positive end had a smiling face and the label “statement couldn’t be clearer/read better”; the negative end had a frowning face and the label “statement couldn’t be more unclear/read worse”. The raters’ task was to move a pointer (initially in the middle of the line) to the place corresponding to their rating. 3 Data Weather forecast texts: In one half of our evaluation experiments we used human-written and automatically generated weather forecasts for the same weather data. The data in our evaluations was for 22 different forecast dates and included outputs from 10 generator systems and one set of human forecasts. This data has also been used for comparative system evaluation in previous research (Langner, 2010; Angeli et al., 2010; Belz and Kow, 2009). The following are examples of weather forecast texts from the data: 1: S SE 2 8 -3 2 INCREAS ING 3 6-4 0 BY MID AF TERNOON 2 : S ’ LY 2 6-3 2 BACKING S SE 3 0 -3 5 BY AFTERNOON INCREAS ING 3 5 -4 0 GUSTS 5 0 BY MID EVENING Image descriptions: In the other half of our evaluations, we used human-written and automatically generated image descriptions for the same images. The data in our evaluations was for 112 different image sets and included outputs from 6 generator systems and 2 sets of human-authored descriptions. This data was originally created in the TUNA Project (van Deemter et al., 2006). The following is an example of an item from the corpus, consisting of a set of images and a description for the entity in the red frame: the smal l blue fan 4 Experimental Set-up 4.1 Evaluation criteria Fluency/Readability: Both the weather forecast and image description evaluation experiments used a quality criterion intended to capture ‘how well a piece of text reads’ , called Fluency in the latter, Readability in the former. Adequacy/Clarity: In the image description experiments, the second quality criterion was Adequacy, explained as “how clear the description is”, and “how easy it would be to identify the image from the description”. This criterion was called Clarity in the weather forecast experiments, explained as “how easy is it to understand what is being described”. 4.2 Raters In the image experiments we used 8 raters (native speakers) in each experiment, from cohorts of 3rdyear undergraduate and postgraduate students doing a degree in a linguistics-related subject. They were paid and spent about 1hour doing the experiment. In the weather forecast experiments, we used 22 raters in each experiment, from among academic staff at our own university. They were not paid and spent about 15 minutes doing the experiment. 232 4.3 Summary overview of experiments Weather VDS-7 (A): VDS-7 scale; weather forecast data; criteria: Readability and Clarity; 22 raters (university staff) each assessing 22 forecasts.

Following detailed instructions, raters first did a small number of practice examples, followed by the texts to be rated, in an order randomised for each rater. Evaluations were carried out via a web interface. They were allowed to interrupt the experiment, and in the case of the 1hour long image description evaluation they were encouraged to take breaks. 5 Comparison and Assessment of Scales Validity is to the extent to which an assessment method measures what it is intended to measure (Svensson, 2000). Validity is often impossible to assess objectively, as is the case of all our criteria except Adequacy, the validity of which we can directly test by looking at correlations with the accuracy with which participants in a separate experiment identify the intended images given their descriptions. A standard method for assessing Reliability is Kendall’s W, a coefficient of concordance, measuring the degree to which different raters agree in their ratings. We report W for all 6 experiments. Stability refers to the extent to which the results of an experiment run on one occasion agree with the results of the same experiment (with the same raters) run on a different occasion. In the present study, we assess stability in an intra-rater, test-retest design, assessing the agreement between the same participant’s responses in the first and second runs of the test with Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient. We report these measures between ratings given in Image VAS (A) vs. those given in Image VAS (B), and between ratings given in Weather VDS-7 (A) vs. those given in Weather VDS-7 (B). We assess Interchangeability, that is, the extent to which our VDS and VAS scales agree, by computing Pearson’s and Spearman’s coefficients between results. We report these measures for all pairs of weather forecast/image description evaluations. We assess the Sensitivity of our scales by determining the number of significant differences between different systems and human authors detected by each scale. We also look at the relative effect of the different experimental factors by computing the F-Ratio for System (the main factor under investigation, so its relative effect should be high), Rater and Text Type (their effect should be low). F-ratios were de- termined by a one-way ANOVA with the evaluation criterion in question as the dependent variable and System, Rater or Text Type as grouping factors. 6 Results 6.1 Interchangeability and Reliability for system/human authored image descriptions Interchangeability: Pearson’s r between the means per system/human in the three image description evaluation experiments were as follows (Spearman’s ρ shown in brackets): Forb.eqAdFlouthV AD S d-(e7Aq)uac.y945a78n*d(V.F9A2l5uS8e*(—An *c)y,.98o36r.748*e1l9a*(tV.i98(Ao.2578nS019s(*5B b) e- tween Image VDS-7 and Image VAS (A) (the main VAS experiment) are extremely high, meaning that they could substitute for each other here.

Between ratings given by the same raters first in Weather VDS-7 (A) and then in Weather VDS-7 (B), Pearson’s r was .656 for Clarity, .704 for Readability. (All significant at p < .01.) Note that these are computed on individual scores (rather than means as in the correlation figures given in previous sections). 6.4 F-ratios and post-hoc analysis for image data The table below shows F-ratios determined by a oneway ANOVA with the evaluation criterion in question (Adequacy/Fluency) as the dependent variable and System/Rater/Text Type as the grouping factor. Note that for System a high F-ratio is desirable, but a low F-ratio is desirable for other factors. tem, the main factor under investigation, VDS-7 found 8 for Adequacy and 14 for Fluency; VAS (A) found 7 for Adequacy and 15 for Fluency. 6.5 F-ratios and post-hoc analysis for weather data The table below shows F-ratios analogous to the previous section (for Clarity/Readability). tem, VDS-7 (A) found 24 for Clarity, 23 for Readability; VAS found 25 for Adequacy, 26 for Fluency. 6.6 Scale validity test for image data Our final table of results shows Pearson’s correlation coefficients (calculated on means per system) between the Adequacy data from the three image description evaluation experiments on the one hand, and the data from an extrinsic experiment in which we measured the accuracy with which participants identified the intended image described by a description: ThecorIlm at iog ne V bAeDSt w-(A7eB)An dA eqd uqe ac uy a cy.I89nD720d 6AI*Dc .Acuray was strong and highly significant in all three image description evaluation experiments, but strongest in VAS (B), and weakest in VAS (A). For comparison, 234 Pearson’s between Fluency and ID Accuracy ranged between .3 and .5, whereas Pearson’s between Adequacy and ID Speed (also measured in the same image identfication experiment) ranged between -.35 and -.29. 7 Discussion and Conclusions Our interchangeability results (Sections 6. 1and 6.2) indicate that the VAS and VDS-7 scales we have tested can substitute for each other in our present evaluation tasks in terms of the mean system scores they produce. Where we were able to measure validity (Section 6.6), both scales were shown to be similarly valid, predicting image identification accuracy figures from a separate experiment equally well. Stability (Section 6.3) was marginally better for VDS-7 data, and Reliability (Sections 6.1 and 6.2) was better for VAS data in the image descrip- tion evaluations, but (mostly) better for VDS-7 data in the weather forecast evaluations. Finally, the VAS experiments found greater numbers of statistically significant differences between systems in 3 out of 4 cases (Section 6.5). Our own raters strongly prefer working with VAS scales over VDSs. This has also long been clear from the psychology literature (Svensson, 2000)), where raters are typically found to prefer VAS scales over VDSs which can be a “constant source of vexation to the conscientious rater when he finds his judgments falling between the defined points” (Champney, 1941). Moreover, if a rater’s judgment falls between two points on a VDS then they must make the false choice between the two points just above and just below their actual judgment. In this case we know that the point they end up selecting is not an accurate measure of their judgment but rather just one of two equally accurate ones (one of which goes unrecorded). Our results establish (for our evaluation tasks) that VAS scales, so far unproven for use in NLP, are at least as good as VDSs, currently virtually the only scale in use in NLP. Combined with the fact that raters strongly prefer VASs and that they are regarded as more amenable to parametric means of statistical analysis, this indicates that VAS scales should be used more widely for NLP evaluation tasks.

<p>Author: Helen Yannakoudakis ; Ted Briscoe ; Ben Medlock</p><p>Abstract: We demonstrate how supervised discriminative machine learning techniques can be used to automate the assessment of ‘English as a Second or Other Language’ (ESOL) examination scripts. In particular, we use rank preference learning to explicitly model the grade relationships between scripts. A number of different features are extracted and ablation tests are used to investigate their contribution to overall performance. A comparison between regression and rank preference models further supports our method. Experimental results on the first publically available dataset show that our system can achieve levels of performance close to the upper bound for the task, as defined by the agreement between human examiners on the same corpus. Finally, using a set of ‘outlier’ texts, we test the validity of our model and identify cases where the model’s scores diverge from that of a human examiner.</p><p>4 0.69876373 <a title="341-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Learning_to_Grade_Short_Answer_Questions_using_Semantic_Similarity_Measures_and_Dependency_Graph_Alignments.html">205 acl-2011-Learning to Grade Short Answer Questions using Semantic Similarity Measures and Dependency Graph Alignments</a></p>

<p>Author: Aaron Michelony</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of predicting which words a student will click in a vocabulary learning system. Often a language learner will find value in the ability to look up the meaning of an unknown word while reading an electronic document by clicking the word. Highlighting words likely to be unknown to a readeris attractive due to drawing his orher attention to it and indicating that information is available. However, this option is usually done manually in vocabulary systems and online encyclopedias such as Wikipedia. Furthurmore, it is never on a per-user basis. This paper presents an automated way of highlighting words likely to be unknown to the specific user. We present related work in search engine ranking, a description of the study used to collect click data, the experiment we performed using the random forest machine learning algorithm and finish with a discussion of future work.</p><p>6 0.66002011 <a title="341-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Automatically_Predicting_Peer-Review_Helpfulness.html">55 acl-2011-Automatically Predicting Peer-Review Helpfulness</a></p>

<p>Author: Kirill Kireyev ; Thomas K Landauer</p><p>Abstract: While computational estimation of difficulty of words in the lexicon is useful in many educational and assessment applications, the concept of scalar word difficulty and current corpus-based methods for its estimation are inadequate. We propose a new paradigm called word meaning maturity which tracks the degree of knowledge of each word at different stages of language learning. We present a computational algorithm for estimating word maturity, based on modeling language acquisition with Latent Semantic Analysis. We demonstrate that the resulting metric not only correlates well with external indicators, but captures deeper semantic effects in language. 1 Motivation It is no surprise that through stages of language learning, different words are learned at different times and are known to different extents. For example, a common word like “dog” is familiar to even a first-grader, whereas a more advanced word like “focal” does not usually enter learners’ vocabulary until much later. Although individual rates of learning words may vary between highand low-performing students, it has been observed that “children [… ] acquire word meanings in roughly the same sequence” (Biemiller, 2008). The aim of this work is to model the degree of knowledge of words at different learning stages. Such a metric would have extremely useful applications in personalized educational technologies, for the purposes of accurate assessment and personalized vocabulary instruction. … 299 .l andaue r } @pear s on .com 2 Rethinking Word Difficulty Previously, related work in education and psychometrics has been concerned with measuring word difficulty or classifying words into different difficulty categories. Examples of such approaches include creation of word lists for targeted vocabulary instruction at various grade levels that were compiled by educational experts, such as Nation (1993) or Biemiller (2008). Such word difficulty assignments are also implicitly present in some readability formulas that estimate difficulty of texts, such as Lexiles (Stenner, 1996), which include a lexical difficulty component based on the frequency of occurrence of words in a representative corpus, on the assumption that word difficulty is inversely correlated to corpus frequency. Additionally, research in psycholinguistics has attempted to outline and measure psycholinguistic dimensions of words such as age-of-acquisition and familiarity, which aim to track when certain words become known and how familiar they appear to an average person. Importantly, all such word difficulty measures can be thought of as functions that assign a single scalar value to each word w: !</p><p>2 0.88800746 <a title="341-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-AM-FM%3A_A_Semantic_Framework_for_Translation_Quality_Assessment.html">2 acl-2011-AM-FM: A Semantic Framework for Translation Quality Assessment</a></p>
<p>Author: Rafael E. Banchs ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: This work introduces AM-FM, a semantic framework for machine translation evaluation. Based upon this framework, a new evaluation metric, which is able to operate without the need for reference translations, is implemented and evaluated. The metric is based on the concepts of adequacy and fluency, which are independently assessed by using a cross-language latent semantic indexing approach and an n-gram based language model approach, respectively. Comparative analyses with conventional evaluation metrics are conducted on two different evaluation tasks (overall quality assessment and comparative ranking) over a large collection of human evaluations involving five European languages. Finally, the main pros and cons of the proposed framework are discussed along with future research directions. 1</p><p>3 0.84829336 <a title="341-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-I_Thou_Thee%2C_Thou_Traitor%3A_Predicting_Formal_vs._Informal_Address_in_English_Literature.html">157 acl-2011-I Thou Thee, Thou Traitor: Predicting Formal vs. Informal Address in English Literature</a></p>
<p>Author: Manaal Faruqui ; Sebastian Pado</p><p>Abstract: In contrast to many languages (like Russian or French), modern English does not distinguish formal and informal (“T/V”) address overtly, for example by pronoun choice. We describe an ongoing study which investigates to what degree the T/V distinction is recoverable in English text, and with what textual features it correlates. Our findings are: (a) human raters can label English utterances as T or V fairly well, given sufficient context; (b), lexical cues can predict T/V almost at human level.</p><p>4 0.83609581 <a title="341-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Jointly_Learning_to_Extract_and_Compress.html">187 acl-2011-Jointly Learning to Extract and Compress</a></p>
<p>Author: Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick ; Dan Gillick ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We learn a joint model of sentence extraction and compression for multi-document summarization. Our model scores candidate summaries according to a combined linear model whose features factor over (1) the n-gram types in the summary and (2) the compressions used. We train the model using a marginbased objective whose loss captures end summary quality. Because of the exponentially large set of candidate summaries, we use a cutting-plane algorithm to incrementally detect and add active constraints efficiently. Inference in our model can be cast as an ILP and thereby solved in reasonable time; we also present a fast approximation scheme which achieves similar performance. Our jointly extracted and compressed summaries outperform both unlearned baselines and our learned extraction-only system on both ROUGE and Pyramid, without a drop in judged linguistic quality. We achieve the highest published ROUGE results to date on the TAC 2008 data set.</p><p>5 0.73750764 <a title="341-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Collective_Classification_of_Congressional_Floor-Debate_Transcripts.html">73 acl-2011-Collective Classification of Congressional Floor-Debate Transcripts</a></p>

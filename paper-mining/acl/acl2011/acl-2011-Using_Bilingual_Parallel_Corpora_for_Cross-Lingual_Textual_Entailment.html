<p>Author: Donald Metzler ; Eduard Hovy ; Chunliang Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Paraphrase generation is an important task that has received a great deal of interest recently. Proposed data-driven solutions to the problem have ranged from simple approaches that make minimal use of NLP tools to more complex approaches that rely on numerous language-dependent resources. Despite all of the attention, there have been very few direct empirical evaluations comparing the merits of the different approaches. This paper empirically examines the tradeoffs between simple and sophisticated paraphrase harvesting approaches to help shed light on their strengths and weaknesses. Our evaluation reveals that very simple approaches fare surprisingly well and have a number of distinct advantages, including strong precision, good coverage, and low redundancy.</p><p>5 0.31611809 <a title="327-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Collecting_Highly_Parallel_Data_for_Paraphrase_Evaluation.html">72 acl-2011-Collecting Highly Parallel Data for Paraphrase Evaluation</a></p>
<p>Author: David Chen ; William Dolan</p><p>Abstract: A lack of standard datasets and evaluation metrics has prevented the field of paraphrasing from making the kind of rapid progress enjoyed by the machine translation community over the last 15 years. We address both problems by presenting a novel data collection framework that produces highly parallel text data relatively inexpensively and on a large scale. The highly parallel nature of this data allows us to use simple n-gram comparisons to measure both the semantic adequacy and lexical dissimilarity of paraphrase candidates. In addition to being simple and efficient to compute, experiments show that these metrics correlate highly with human judgments.</p><p>6 0.30965424 <a title="327-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-A_Probabilistic_Modeling_Framework_for_Lexical_Entailment.html">22 acl-2011-A Probabilistic Modeling Framework for Lexical Entailment</a></p>

<p>Author: Hassan Sajjad ; Alexander Fraser ; Helmut Schmid</p><p>Abstract: We propose a language-independent method for the automatic extraction of transliteration pairs from parallel corpora. In contrast to previous work, our method uses no form of supervision, and does not require linguistically informed preprocessing. We conduct experiments on data sets from the NEWS 2010 shared task on transliteration mining and achieve an F-measure of up to 92%, outperforming most of the semi-supervised systems that were submitted. We also apply our method to English/Hindi and English/Arabic parallel corpora and compare the results with manually built gold standards which mark transliterated word pairs. Finally, we integrate the transliteration module into the GIZA++ word aligner and evaluate it on two word alignment tasks achieving improvements in both precision and recall measured against gold standard word alignments.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.7825473 <a title="327-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Using_Bilingual_Parallel_Corpora_for_Cross-Lingual_Textual_Entailment.html">327 acl-2011-Using Bilingual Parallel Corpora for Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment</a></p>

<p>Author: Marius Pasca</p><p>Abstract: The role of search queries, as available within query sessions or in isolation from one another, in examined in the context of ranking the class labels (e.g., brazilian cities, business centers, hilly sites) extracted from Web documents for various instances (e.g., rio de janeiro). The co-occurrence of a class label and an instance, in the same query or within the same query session, is used to reinforce the estimated relevance of the class label for the instance. Experiments over evaluation sets of instances associated with Web search queries illustrate the higher quality of the query-based, re-ranked class labels, relative to ranking baselines using documentbased counts.</p><p>4 0.73246229 <a title="327-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-A_Probabilistic_Modeling_Framework_for_Lexical_Entailment.html">22 acl-2011-A Probabilistic Modeling Framework for Lexical Entailment</a></p>
<p>Author: Eyal Shnarch ; Jacob Goldberger ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing entailment at the lexical level is an important and commonly-addressed component in textual inference. Yet, this task has been mostly approached by simplified heuristic methods. This paper proposes an initial probabilistic modeling framework for lexical entailment, with suitable EM-based parameter estimation. Our model considers prominent entailment factors, including differences in lexical-resources reliability and the impacts of transitivity and multiple evidence. Evaluations show that the proposed model outperforms most prior systems while pointing at required future improvements. 1 Introduction and Background Textual Entailment was proposed as a generic paradigm for applied semantic inference (Dagan et al., 2006). This task requires deciding whether a tex- tual statement (termed the hypothesis-H) can be inferred (entailed) from another text (termed the textT). Since it was first introduced, the six rounds of the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) challenges1 , currently organized under NIST, have become a standard benchmark for entailment systems. These systems tackle their complex task at various levels of inference, including logical representation (Tatu and Moldovan, 2007; MacCartney and Manning, 2007), semantic analysis (Burchardt et al., 2007) and syntactic parsing (Bar-Haim et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009). Inference at these levels usually 1http://www.nist.gov/tac/2010/RTE/index.html 558 requires substantial processing and resources (e.g. parsing) aiming at high performance. Nevertheless, simple entailment methods, performing at the lexical level, provide strong baselines which most systems did not outperform (Mirkin et al., 2009; Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010). Within complex systems, lexical entailment modeling is an important component. Finally, there are cases in which a full system cannot be used (e.g. lacking a parser for a targeted language) and one must resort to the simpler lexical approach. While lexical entailment methods are widely used, most of them apply ad hoc heuristics which do not rely on a principled underlying framework. Typically, such methods quantify the degree of lexical coverage of the hypothesis terms by the text’s terms. Coverage is determined either by a direct match of identical terms in T and H or by utilizing lexical semantic resources, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), that capture lexical entailment relations (denoted here as entailment rules). Common heuristics for quantifying the degree of coverage are setting a threshold on the percentage coverage of H’s terms (Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010), counting absolute number of uncovered terms (Clark and Harrison, 2010), or applying an Information Retrievalstyle vector space similarity score (MacKinlay and Baldwin, 2009). Other works (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005; Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006) have applied a heuristic formula to estimate the similarity between text fragments based on a similarity function between their terms. These heuristics do not capture several important aspects of entailment, such as varying reliability of Proceedings ofP thoer t4l9atnhd A, Onrnuegaoln M,e Jeuntineg 19 o-f2 t4h,e 2 A0s1s1o.c?i ac t2io0n11 fo Ar Cssoocmiaptuiotanti foonra Clo Lminpguutiast i ocns:aslh Loirntpgaupisetrics , pages 558–563, entailment resources and the impact of rule chaining and multiple evidence on entailment likelihood. An additional observation from these and other systems is that their performance improves only moderately when utilizing lexical resources2. We believe that the textual entailment field would benefit from more principled models for various entailment phenomena. Inspired by the earlier steps in the evolution of Statistical Machine Translation methods (such as the initial IBM models (Brown et al., 1993)), we formulate a concrete generative probabilistic modeling framework that captures the basic aspects of lexical entailment. Parameter estimation is addressed by an EM-based approach, which enables estimating the hidden lexical-level entailment parameters from entailment annotations which are available only at the sentence-level. While heuristic methods are limited in their ability to wisely integrate indications for entailment, probabilistic methods have the advantage of being extendable and enabling the utilization of wellfounded probabilistic methods such as the EM algorithm. We compared the performance of several model variations to previously published results on RTE data sets, as well as to our own implementation of typical lexical baselines. Results show that both the probabilistic model and our percentagecoverage baseline perform favorably relative to prior art. These results support the viability of the probabilistic framework while pointing at certain modeling aspects that need to be improved. 2 Probabilistic Model Under the lexical entailment scope, our modeling goal is obtaining a probabilistic score for the likelihood that all H’s terms are entailed by T. To that end, we model prominent aspects of lexical entailment, which were mostly neglected by previous lexical methods: (1) distinguishing different reliability levels of lexical resources; (2) allowing transitive chains of rule applications and considering their length when estimating their validity; and (3) considering multiple entailments when entailing a term. 2See ablation tests reports in http://aclweb.org/aclwiki/ index.php?title=RTE Knowledge Resources#Ablation Tests 559 Figure 1: The generative process of entailing terms of a hypothesis from a text. Edges represent entailment rules. There are 3 evidences for the entailment of hi :a rule from Resource1 , another one from Resource3 both suggesting that tj entails it, and a chain from t1through an intermediate term t0. 2.1 Model Description For T to entail H it is usually a necessary, but not sufficient, that every term h ∈ H would be entsauiflefidci by ,at t hleatast e one t teerrmm mt h ∈ ∈T (Glickman eet al., 2006). Figure s1t odneescr tiebrmes tth ∈e process komf entailing hypothesis terms. The trivial case is when identical terms, possibly at the stem or lemma level, appear in T and H (a direct match as tn and hm in Figure 1). Alternatively, we can establish entailment based on knowledge of entailing lexical-semantic relations, such as synonyms, hypernyms and morphological derivations, available in lexical resources (e.g the rule inference → reasoning from WordNet). (We.eg d theneo rutel by R(r) cthee → resource nwgh ficroh provided teht)e. rule r. Since entailment is a transitive relation, rules may compose transitive chains that connect a term t ∈ T ctoo a pteosrme rha ∈ Hive through hinatte cromnendeicatte a tteerrmms. t ∈Fo Tr instance, fr hom ∈ t hHe r thurleosu infer → inference armnds inference → reasoning we can dre →duc inef tehreen rcuele a infer → reasoning (were inference dise dthuec ein thteerm rueldeia intef trer →m as t0 in Figure 1). Multiple chains may connect t to h (as for tj and hi in Figure 1) or connect several terms in T to h (as t1 and tj are indicating the entailment of hi in Figure 1), thus providing multiple evidence for h’s entailment. It is reasonable to expect that if a term t indeed entails a term h, it is likely to find evidences for this relation in several resources. Taking a probabilistic perspective, we assume a parameter θR for each resource R, denoting its reliability, i.e. the prior probability that applying a rule from R corresponds to a valid entailment instance. Direct matches are considered as a special “resource”, called MATCH, for which θMATCH is expected to be close to 1. We now present our probabilistic model. For a text term t ∈ T to entail a hypothesis term h by a tcehxatin te c, mde tn ∈ote Td by etn →tcai h, thhyep application mof h every r ∈ c must be valid.

The probability that T does not entail h at all (by any chain), specified in Eq. 2, is the probability that all these chains are not valid. Finally, the probability that T entails all of H, assuming independence of H’s terms, is the probability that every h ∈ H is entailed, as given ien p Eq. a3b. Nityot tihceat t ehvaet yth here ∈ c oHul ids be a term h which is not covered by any available rule chain. Under this formulation, we assume that each such h is covered by a single rule coming from a special “resource” called UNCOVERED (expecting θUNCOVERED to be relatively small). p(t −→c h) = Yp(lhs →r rhs) = Yr∈c p(T 9 h) = Y YθR(r)(1) Yr∈c [1 − p(t− →c h)] (2) c∈YC(h) p(T → H) = Y p(T → h) (3) hY∈H As can be seen, our model indeed distinguishes varying resource reliability, decreases entailment probability as rule chains grow and increases it when entailment of a term is supported by multiple chains. The above treatment of uncovered terms in H, as captured in Eq. 3, assumes that their entailment probability is independent of the rest of the hypothesis. However, when the number of covered hypothesis terms increases the probability that the remaining terms are actually entailed by T increases too 560 (even though we do not have supporting knowledge for their entailment). Thus, an alternative model is to group all uncovered terms together and estimate the overall probability of their joint entailment as a function of the lexical coverage of the hypothesis. We denote Hc as the subset of H’s terms which are covered by some rule chain and Huc as the remaining uncovered part. Eq. 3a then provides a refined entailment model for H, in which the second term specifies the probability that Huc is entailed given that Hc is validly entailed and the corresponding lengths: p(T→H) = [Yp(T→h)]·p(T→Huc hY∈Hc 2.2 | |Hc|,|H|) (3a) Parameter Estimation The difficulty in estimating the θR values is that these are term-level parameters while the RTEtraining entailment annotation is given for the sentence-level. Therefore, we use EM-based estimation for the hidden parameters (Dempster et al., 1977). In the E step we use the current θR values to compute all whcr (T, H) values for each training pair. whcr (T, H) stands for the posterior probability that application of the rule r in the chain c for h ∈ H tish valid, given nth oaft heieth reurl eT r e innta thiles c Hha or not ra hcc ∈ord Hing to the training annotation (see Eq. 4). Remember that a rule r provides an entailment relation between its left-hand-side (lhs) and its right-hand-side (rhs). Therefore Eq. 4 uses the notation lhs →r rhs to designate the application of the rule r (similar htos Eq. 1). wEhc:r(T,H)=   p (lTh9→sH−→ |rlhsrp−→ rh(Tsr→9|hTsH )9→p(lhHs−→ r) =hs)if(4T)9→H After applying Bayes’ rule we get a fraction with Eq. 3 in its denominator and θR(r) as the second term of the numerator. The first numerator term is defined as in Eq. 3 except that for the corresponding rule application we substitute θR(r) by 1(per the conditioning event). The probabilistic model defined by Eq. 1-3 is a loop-free directed acyclic graphical model (aka a Bayesian network). Hence the E-step probabilities can be efficiently calculated using the belief propagation algorithm (Pearl, 1988). The M step uses Eq. 5 to update the parameter set. For each resource R we average the whcr (T, H) val- ues for all its rule applications in the training, whose total number is denoted nR.

We also tried initializing the EM algorithm with these direct estimations but did not obtain performance improvements. 3 Evaluations and Results The 5th Recognizing Textual Entailment challenge (RTE-5) introduced a new search task (Bentivogli et al., 2009) which became the main task in RTE6 (Bentivogli et al., 2010). In this task participants should find all sentences that entail a given hypothesis in a given document cluster. This task’s data sets reflect a natural distribution of entailments in a corpus and demonstrate a more realistic scenario than the previous RTE challenges. In our system, sentences are tokenized and stripped of stop words and terms are lemmatized and tagged for part-of-speech. As lexical resources we use WordNet (WN) (Fellbaum, 1998), taking as entailment rules synonyms, derivations, hyponyms and meronyms of the first senses of T and H terms, and the CatVar (Categorial Variation) database (Habash and Dorr, 2003). We allow rule chains of length up to 4 in WordNet (WN4). We compare our model to two types of baselines: (1) RTE published results: the average of the best runs of all systems, the best and second best performing lexical systems and the best full system of each challenge; (2) our implementation of lexical 561 coverage model, tuning the percentage-of-coverage threshold for entailment on the training set. This model uses the same configuration as ourprobabilistic model. We also implemented an Information Re- trieval style baseline3 (both with and without lexical expansions), but given its poorer performance we omit its results here. Table 1 presents the results. We can see that both our implemented models (probabilistic and coverage) outperform all RTE lexical baselines on both data sets, apart from (Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010) which incorporates additional lexical resources, a named entity recognizer and a co-reference system. On RTE-5, the probabilistic model is comparable in performance to the best full system, while the coverage model achieves considerably better results. We notice that our implemented models successfully utilize resources to increase performance, as opposed to typical smaller or less consistent improvements in prior works (see Section 1).

In particular, WN4 performs better than the single-step WN only on RTE-5, suggesting the need to improve the modeling of chain- ing. The fluctuations over the data sets and impacts of resources suggest the need for further investigation over additional data sets and resources. As for the coverage model, under our configuration it poses a bigger challenge for RTE systems than perviously reported baselines. It is thus proposed as an easy to implement baseline for future entailment research. 4 Conclusions and Future Work This paper presented, for the first time, a principled and relatively rich probabilistic model for lexical entailment, amenable for estimation of hidden lexicallevel parameters from standard sentence-level annotations. The positive results of the probabilistic model compared to prior art and its ability to exploit lexical resources indicate its future potential. Yet, further investigation is needed. For example, analyzing current model’s limitations, we observed that the multiplicative nature of eqs. 1and 3 (reflecting independence assumptions) is too restrictive, resembling a logical AND. Accordingly we plan to explore relaxing this strict conjunctive behavior through models such as noisy-AND (Pearl, 1988). We also intend to explore the contribution of our model, and particularly its estimated parameter values, within a complex system that integrates multiple levels of inference.

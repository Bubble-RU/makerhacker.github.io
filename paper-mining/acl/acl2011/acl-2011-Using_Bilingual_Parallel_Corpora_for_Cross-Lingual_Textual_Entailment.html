</p><p>8 On the other side  such unpredictable errors reduce the possibility to control the behaviour of the engine, and devise adhoc solutions to specific entailment problems. [sent-23, score-0.322]
</p><p>9 , 2010) as a term of comparison, we experiment with different sources of multilingual lexical knowledge to address the following questions: (1) What is the potential of the existing multilingual lexical resources to approach CLTE? [sent-30, score-0.506]
</p><p>10 To answer this question we experiment with lexical knowledge extracted from bilingual dictionaries, and from a multilingual lexical database. [sent-31, score-0.503]
</p><p>11 As regards the resources, phrase and paraphrase tables extracted from bilingual parallel corpora can be exploited as an effective way to capture both lexical relations between single words, and contextual information useful for inference. [sent-35, score-1.263]
</p><p>12 As regards the algorithms, statistical models based on cooccurrence observations, similar to those used in MT to estimate translation probabilities, may contribute to estimate entailment probabilities in CLTE. [sent-36, score-0.35]
</p><p>13 Focusing on the resources direction, the main contribution of this paper is to show that the lexical knowledge extracted from parallel corpora allows to significantly improve the results achieved with other multilingual resources. [sent-37, score-0.607]
</p><p>14 Our experiments show that, although CLTE seems intrinsically more difficult, the results obtained using phrase and paraphrase tables are better than those achieved by average systems on monolingual datasets. [sent-39, score-0.905]
</p><p>15 We argue that this is due to the fact that parallel corpora are a rich source of crosslingual paraphrases with no equivalents in monolingual TE. [sent-40, score-0.441]
</p><p>16 (4) Can parallel corpora be useful also for monolingual TE? [sent-41, score-0.341]
</p><p>17 To answer this question, we experiment 1337 on monolingual RTE datasets using paraphrase tables extracted from bilingual parallel corpora. [sent-42, score-1.028]
</p><p>18 Our results improve those achieved with the most widely used resources in monolingual TE, namely WordNet, Verbocean, and Wikipedia. [sent-43, score-0.312]
</p><p>19 Section 2 shortly overviews the role of lexical knowledge in textual entailment, highlighting a gap between TE and CLTE in terms of available knowledge sources. [sent-45, score-0.324]
</p><p>20 Sections 3 and 4 address the first three questions, giving motivations for the use of bilingual parallel corpora in CLTE, and showing the results of our experiments. [sent-46, score-0.33]
</p><p>21 Section 5 addresses the last question, reporting on our experiments with paraphrase  tables extracted from phrase tables on the monolingual RTE datasets. [sent-47, score-1.112]
</p><p>22 2  Lexical resources for TE and CLTE  All current approaches to monolingual TE, either syntactically oriented (Rus et al. [sent-49, score-0.24]
</p><p>23 , 2008), incorporate different types of lexical knowledge to support textual inference. [sent-51, score-0.269]
</p><p>24 Such information ranges from i) lexical paraphrases (textual equivalences between terms) to ii) lexical relations preserving entailment between words, and iii) wordlevel similarity/relatedness scores. [sent-52, score-0.595]
</p><p>25 Synonymy relations can be used to extract lexical paraphrases indicating that words from the text and the hypothesis entail each other, thus being interchangeable. [sent-54, score-0.295]
</p><p>26 DIRT is a collection of statistically learned inference rules, that is often integrated as a source of lexical paraphrases and entailment rules. [sent-64, score-0.47]
</p><p>27 VerbOcean is a graph of fine-grained semantic relations between verbs, which are frequently used as a source of precise entailment rules between predicates. [sent-65, score-0.317]
</p><p>28 It can be used as an alternative source of entailment rules, or to determine the semantic overlap between texts and hypotheses. [sent-67, score-0.281]
</p><p>29 Wikipedia is often used to extract  probabilistic entailment rules based word similarity/relatedness scores. [sent-68, score-0.311]
</p><p>30 Despite the consensus on the usefulness of lexical knowledge for textual inference, determining the actual impact of these resources is not straightforward, as they always represent one component in complex architectures that may use them in different ways. [sent-69, score-0.362]
</p><p>31 Addressing CLTE we have to face additional and more problematic issues related to: i) the stronger need of lexical knowledge, and ii) the limited availability of multilingual lexical resources. [sent-75, score-0.288]
</p><p>32 As regards the first issue, it’s worth noting that in the monolingual scenario simple “bag of words” (or “bag of ngrams”) approaches are per se sufficient to achieve results above baseline. [sent-76, score-0.248]
</p><p>33 This situation makes the availability of multilingual lexical knowledge a necessary condition to bridge the language gap. [sent-78, score-0.284]
</p><p>34 As regards Wikipedia, the crosslingual links between pages in different languages offer a possibility to extract lexical knowledge useful for CLTE. [sent-85, score-0.313]
</p><p>35 In addition,  featuring a bias towards named entities, the information acquired through cross-lingual links can at most complement the lexical knowledge extracted from more generic multilingual resources (e. [sent-87, score-0.371]
</p><p>36 3 Using Parallel Corpora for CLTE Bilingual parallel corpora represent a possible solution to overcome the inadequacy of the existing resources, and to implement a portable approach for CLTE. [sent-89, score-0.296]
</p><p>37 To this aim, we exploit parallel data to: i) learn alignment criteria between phrasal elements in different languages, ii) use them to automatically extract lexical knowledge in the form of phrase tables, and iii) use the obtained phrase tables to create monolingual paraphrase tables. [sent-90, score-1.368]
</p><p>38 Given a cross-lingual T/H pair (with the text in l1 and the hypothesis in l2), our approach leverages the vast amount of lexical knowledge provided by phrase and paraphrase tables to map H into T. [sent-91, score-0.858]
</p><p>39 The first method uses a single phrase table to directly map phrases extracted from the hypothesis to phrases in the text. [sent-93, score-0.326]
</p><p>40 In order to improve our system’s  generalization capabilities and increase the coverage, the second method combines the phrase table with two monolingual paraphrase tables (one in l1, and one in l2). [sent-94, score-0.821]
</p><p>41 use the paraphrase table in l2 to find paraphrases of phrases extracted from H; 2. [sent-96, score-0.539]
</p><p>42 use the paraphrase table in l1 to find paraphrases of the extracted fragments in l1; 4. [sent-98, score-0.49]
</p><p>43 With the second method, phrasal matches between the text and the hypothesis are indirectly performed through paraphrases of the phrase table entries. [sent-100, score-0.394]
</p><p>44 The final entailment decision for a T/H pair is assigned considering a model learned from the similarity scores based on the identified phrasal matches. [sent-101, score-0.36]
</p><p>45 This way to approximate entailment reflects the intuition that, as a directional relation between the text and the hy-  pothesis, the full content of H has to be found in T. [sent-103, score-0.281]
</p><p>46 1 Extracting Phrase and Paraphrase Tables Phrase tables (PHT) contain pairs of corresponding phrases in two languages, together with association probabilities. [sent-105, score-0.308]
</p><p>47 The one adopted in this work consists in learning phrase alignments from a word-aligned bilingual corpus. [sent-109, score-0.259]
</p><p>48 In order to build English-Spanish phrase tables for our experiments, we used the freely available Europarl V. [sent-110, score-0.349]
</p><p>49 Subsequently, we extracted the bilingual phrase table from the aligned corpora using the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al. [sent-113, score-0.389]
</p><p>50 In addition, in or-  der to experiment with different phrase tables providing different degrees of coverage and precision, we extracted 7 phrase tables by pruning the initial one on the direct phrase translation probabilities of 0. [sent-116, score-1.044]
</p><p>51 org/wmt10/ 1339 phrase tables range from 76 to 48 million entries, with an average of 3. [sent-126, score-0.349]
</p><p>52 Paraphrase tables (PPHT) contain pairs of corresponding phrases in the same language, possibly associated with probabilities. [sent-128, score-0.308]
</p><p>53 One of the proposed methods to extract paraphrases relies on a pivot-based approach using phrase alignments in a bilingual parallel corpus (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005). [sent-132, score-0.518]
</p><p>54 In our work we used available2 paraphrase databases for English and Spanish which have been extracted using the method previously outlined. [sent-136, score-0.39]
</p><p>55 Moreover, in order to experiment with different paraphrase sets providing different degrees of coverage and precision, we pruned the main paraphrase table based on the probabilities, associated to its entries, of 0. [sent-137, score-0.758]
</p><p>56 2 Phrasal Matching Method In order to maximize the usage oflexical knowledge, our entailment decision criterion is based on similarity scores calculated with a phrase-to-phrase matching process. [sent-144, score-0.344]
</p><p>57 Lexical: in the case that two different phrases can be mapped through entries of the resources used to bridge T and H (i. [sent-155, score-0.239]
</p><p>58 phrase tables, paraphrases tables, dictionaries or any other source of lexical knowledge). [sent-157, score-0.365]
</p><p>59 To reduce redundant matches, the lexical matches between pairs of  phrases which have already been identified as exact matches are not considered. [sent-161, score-0.275]
</p><p>60 Once matching for each n-gram level has been concluded, the number of matches (Mn) and the number of phrases in the hypothesis (Nn) are used to estimate the portion of phrases in H that are matched at each level (n). [sent-162, score-0.253]
</p><p>61 1 Dataset The dataset used for our experiments is an EnglishSpanish entailment corpus obtained from the original RTE3 dataset by translating the English hypothesis into Spanish. [sent-166, score-0.479]
</p><p>62 The T-H pairs in the collected English-Spanish entailment corpus were annotated using TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) and the Snowball stemmer6 with token, lemma, and stem information. [sent-175, score-0.351]
</p><p>63 2  Knowledge sources  For comparison with the extracted phrase and paraphrase tables, we use a large bilingual dictionary and MultiWordNet as alternative sources of lexical knowledge. [sent-177, score-0.822]
</p><p>64 To create a large bilingual English-Spanish dictionary we processed and combined the following dictionaries and bilingual resources: - XDXF Dictionaries7: 22,486 entries. [sent-179, score-0.325]
</p><p>65 This section reports the percentage of correct entailment assignments (accuracy), comparing the use of different sources of lexical knowledge. [sent-200, score-0.412]
</p><p>66 Initially, in order to find a reasonable trade-off be-  tween precision and coverage, we used the 7 phrase tables extracted with different pruning thresholds  8http://www. [sent-201, score-0.525]
</p><p>67 The curve demonstrates that, although with higher pruning thresholds we retain more reliable phrase pairs, their smaller number provides limited coverage leading to lower results. [sent-218, score-0.312]
</p><p>68 Once the threshold has been set, in order to prove the effectiveness of information extracted from bilingual corpora, we conducted a series of experiments using the different resources mentioned in Section 4. [sent-221, score-0.294]
</p><p>69 As it can be observed in Table 1, the highest results are achieved using the phrase table, both alone and in combination with paraphrase tables (62. [sent-223, score-0.716]
</p><p>70 These results suggest that, with appropriate pruning thresholds, the large number and the longer entries contained in the phrase and paraphrase tables represent an effective way to: i) obtain high coverage, and ii) capture cross-lingual associations between multiple lexical elements. [sent-226, score-0.943]
</p><p>71 Overall, our results suggest that the lexical knowledge extracted from parallel data can be successfully used to approach the CLTE task. [sent-230, score-0.338]
</p><p>72 Building on the positive results achieved on the cross-lingual scenario, we investigate the possibility to exploit bilingual parallel corpora in the traditional monolingual scenario. [sent-251, score-0.56]
</p><p>73 Using the same approach discussed in Section 4, we compare the results achieved with English paraphrase tables with those obtained with other widely used monolingual knowledge resources over two RTE datasets. [sent-252, score-0.96]
</p><p>74 2 Knowledge sources We compared the results achieved with paraphrase tables (extracted with different pruning thresholds12) with those obtained using the three most 12We pruned the paraphrase table (PPHT), with probabilities set to 0. [sent-263, score-1.112]
</p><p>75 The first two rows of the table show that pruned paraphrase tables always outperform the other lexical resources used for comparison, with an accuracy increase up to 3%. [sent-285, score-0.763]
</p><p>76 Overall, these results confirm our claim that increasing the coverage using context sensitive phrase pairs obtained from large parallel corpora, results in better performance not only in CLTE, but also in the monolingual scenario. [sent-291, score-0.582]
</p><p>77 The comparison with the results achieved on monolingual data obtained by automatically translating the Spanish hypotheses (RTE3-G row in Table 2) leads to four main observations. [sent-292, score-0.291]
</p><p>78 This suggests that the noise introduced by incorrect translations can be tackled by increasing the coverage of the paraphrase table. [sent-297, score-0.434]
</p><p>79 Third, the accuracy obtained over the CLTE corpus using combined phrase and paraphrase tables (62. [sent-303, score-0.716]
</p><p>80 In all the other cases, the use of phrase and paraphrase tables on CLTE data outperforms the results achieved on the same data after translation. [sent-306, score-0.716]
</p><p>81 Finally, it’s worth remarking that applying our phrase matching method on the translated dataset without any additional source of knowledge would result in an overall accuracy of 62. [sent-307, score-0.284]
</p><p>82 12%, which is lower than the result obtained using only phrase tables on cross-lingual data (62. [sent-308, score-0.391]
</p><p>83 This demonstrates that phrase tables can successfully replace MT systems in the CLTE task. [sent-310, score-0.349]
</p><p>84 In light of this, we suggest that extracting lexical knowledge from parallel corpora is a preferable solution to approach CLTE. [sent-311, score-0.374]
</p><p>85 One of the main rea-  sons is that placing a black-box MT system at the front-end of the entailment process reduces the possibility to cope with wrong translations. [sent-312, score-0.322]
</p><p>86 Moreover, the task of developing a full-fledged MT system often requires the availability of parallel corpora, and is much more complex than extracting lexical knowledge from them. [sent-316, score-0.314]
</p><p>87 6  Conclusion and Future Work  In this paper we approached the cross-lingual Textual Entailment task focusing on the role of lexical knowledge extracted from bilingual parallel cor1343 pora. [sent-317, score-0.474]
</p><p>88 One of the main difficulties in CLTE raises from the lack of adequate knowledge resources to bridge the lexical gap between texts and hypotheses in different languages. [sent-318, score-0.297]
</p><p>89 Our approach builds on the intuition that the vast amount of knowledge that can be extracted from parallel data (in the form of phrase and paraphrase tables) offers a possible solution to the problem. [sent-319, score-0.733]
</p><p>90 Our results show that phrase and paraphrase tables allow to: i) outperform the results achieved with the few multilingual lexical resources available, and ii) reach performance levels above the average scores obtained by participants in the monolingual RTE3 challenge. [sent-321, score-1.156]
</p><p>91 These improvements can be explained by the fact that the lexical knowledge extracted from parallel data provides good coverage both at the level of single words, and at the level of phrases. [sent-322, score-0.416]
</p><p>92 As a further contribution, we explored the application of paraphrase tables extracted from parallel data in the traditional monolingual scenario. [sent-323, score-0.892]
</p><p>93 Contrasting results with those obtained with the most widely used resources in TE, we demonstrated the effectiveness of paraphrase tables as a mean to overcome the bias towards single words featured by the existing resources. [sent-324, score-0.785]
</p><p>94 Our future work will address both the extraction of lexical information from bilingual parallel cor-  pora, and its use for TE and CLTE. [sent-325, score-0.354]
</p><p>95 On one side, we plan to explore alternative ways to build phrase and paraphrase tables. [sent-326, score-0.448]
</p><p>96 One possible direction is to consider linguistically motivated approaches, such as the extraction of syntactic phrase tables as proposed by (Yamada and Knight, 2001). [sent-327, score-0.349]
</p><p>97 Another interesting direction is to investigate the potential of paraphrase patterns (i. [sent-328, score-0.325]
</p><p>98 patterns including partof-speech slots), extracted from bilingual parallel corpora with the method proposed by (Zhao et al. [sent-330, score-0.395]
</p><p>99 As a first step, the probability scores assigned to phrasal entries will be considered to perform weighted phrase matching as an improved criterion to approximate entailment. [sent-333, score-0.332]

We claim that, in spite of the inherent difficulties of the task, phrase tables extracted from parallel data allow to capture both lexical relations between single words, and contextual information useful for inference. We experiment with a phrasal matching method in order to: i) build a system portable across languages, and ii) evaluate the contribution of lexical knowledge in isolation, without interaction with other inference mechanisms. Results achieved on an English-Spanish corpus obtained from the RTE3 dataset support our claim, with an overall accuracy above average scores reported by RTE participants on monolingual data.

<p>Author: Eyal Shnarch ; Jacob Goldberger ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing entailment at the lexical level is an important and commonly-addressed component in textual inference. Yet, this task has been mostly approached by simplified heuristic methods. This paper proposes an initial probabilistic modeling framework for lexical entailment, with suitable EM-based parameter estimation. Our model considers prominent entailment factors, including differences in lexical-resources reliability and the impacts of transitivity and multiple evidence. Evaluations show that the proposed model outperforms most prior systems while pointing at required future improvements. 1 Introduction and Background Textual Entailment was proposed as a generic paradigm for applied semantic inference (Dagan et al., 2006). This task requires deciding whether a tex- tual statement (termed the hypothesis-H) can be inferred (entailed) from another text (termed the textT). Since it was first introduced, the six rounds of the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) challenges1 , currently organized under NIST, have become a standard benchmark for entailment systems. These systems tackle their complex task at various levels of inference, including logical representation (Tatu and Moldovan, 2007; MacCartney and Manning, 2007), semantic analysis (Burchardt et al., 2007) and syntactic parsing (Bar-Haim et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009). Inference at these levels usually 1http://www.nist.gov/tac/2010/RTE/index.html 558 requires substantial processing and resources (e.g. parsing) aiming at high performance. Nevertheless, simple entailment methods, performing at the lexical level, provide strong baselines which most systems did not outperform (Mirkin et al., 2009; Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010). Within complex systems, lexical entailment modeling is an important component. Finally, there are cases in which a full system cannot be used (e.g. lacking a parser for a targeted language) and one must resort to the simpler lexical approach. While lexical entailment methods are widely used, most of them apply ad hoc heuristics which do not rely on a principled underlying framework. Typically, such methods quantify the degree of lexical coverage of the hypothesis terms by the text’s terms. Coverage is determined either by a direct match of identical terms in T and H or by utilizing lexical semantic resources, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), that capture lexical entailment relations (denoted here as entailment rules). Common heuristics for quantifying the degree of coverage are setting a threshold on the percentage coverage of H’s terms (Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010), counting absolute number of uncovered terms (Clark and Harrison, 2010), or applying an Information Retrievalstyle vector space similarity score (MacKinlay and Baldwin, 2009). Other works (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005; Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006) have applied a heuristic formula to estimate the similarity between text fragments based on a similarity function between their terms. These heuristics do not capture several important aspects of entailment, such as varying reliability of Proceedings ofP thoer t4l9atnhd A, Onrnuegaoln M,e Jeuntineg 19 o-f2 t4h,e 2 A0s1s1o.c?i ac t2io0n11 fo Ar Cssoocmiaptuiotanti foonra Clo Lminpguutiast i ocns:aslh Loirntpgaupisetrics , pages 558–563, entailment resources and the impact of rule chaining and multiple evidence on entailment likelihood. An additional observation from these and other systems is that their performance improves only moderately when utilizing lexical resources2. We believe that the textual entailment field would benefit from more principled models for various entailment phenomena. Inspired by the earlier steps in the evolution of Statistical Machine Translation methods (such as the initial IBM models (Brown et al., 1993)), we formulate a concrete generative probabilistic modeling framework that captures the basic aspects of lexical entailment. Parameter estimation is addressed by an EM-based approach, which enables estimating the hidden lexical-level entailment parameters from entailment annotations which are available only at the sentence-level. While heuristic methods are limited in their ability to wisely integrate indications for entailment, probabilistic methods have the advantage of being extendable and enabling the utilization of wellfounded probabilistic methods such as the EM algorithm. We compared the performance of several model variations to previously published results on RTE data sets, as well as to our own implementation of typical lexical baselines. Results show that both the probabilistic model and our percentagecoverage baseline perform favorably relative to prior art. These results support the viability of the probabilistic framework while pointing at certain modeling aspects that need to be improved. 2 Probabilistic Model Under the lexical entailment scope, our modeling goal is obtaining a probabilistic score for the likelihood that all H’s terms are entailed by T. To that end, we model prominent aspects of lexical entailment, which were mostly neglected by previous lexical methods: (1) distinguishing different reliability levels of lexical resources; (2) allowing transitive chains of rule applications and considering their length when estimating their validity; and (3) considering multiple entailments when entailing a term. 2See ablation tests reports in http://aclweb.org/aclwiki/ index.php?title=RTE Knowledge Resources#Ablation Tests 559 Figure 1: The generative process of entailing terms of a hypothesis from a text. Edges represent entailment rules. There are 3 evidences for the entailment of hi :a rule from Resource1 , another one from Resource3 both suggesting that tj entails it, and a chain from t1through an intermediate term t0. 2.1 Model Description For T to entail H it is usually a necessary, but not sufficient, that every term h ∈ H would be entsauiflefidci by ,at t hleatast e one t teerrmm mt h ∈ ∈T (Glickman eet al., 2006). Figure s1t odneescr tiebrmes tth ∈e process komf entailing hypothesis terms. The trivial case is when identical terms, possibly at the stem or lemma level, appear in T and H (a direct match as tn and hm in Figure 1). Alternatively, we can establish entailment based on knowledge of entailing lexical-semantic relations, such as synonyms, hypernyms and morphological derivations, available in lexical resources (e.g the rule inference → reasoning from WordNet). (We.eg d theneo rutel by R(r) cthee → resource nwgh ficroh provided teht)e. rule r. Since entailment is a transitive relation, rules may compose transitive chains that connect a term t ∈ T ctoo a pteosrme rha ∈ Hive through hinatte cromnendeicatte a tteerrmms. t ∈Fo Tr instance, fr hom ∈ t hHe r thurleosu infer → inference armnds inference → reasoning we can dre →duc inef tehreen rcuele a infer → reasoning (were inference dise dthuec ein thteerm rueldeia intef trer →m as t0 in Figure 1). Multiple chains may connect t to h (as for tj and hi in Figure 1) or connect several terms in T to h (as t1 and tj are indicating the entailment of hi in Figure 1), thus providing multiple evidence for h’s entailment. It is reasonable to expect that if a term t indeed entails a term h, it is likely to find evidences for this relation in several resources. Taking a probabilistic perspective, we assume a parameter θR for each resource R, denoting its reliability, i.e. the prior probability that applying a rule from R corresponds to a valid entailment instance. Direct matches are considered as a special “resource”, called MATCH, for which θMATCH is expected to be close to 1. We now present our probabilistic model. For a text term t ∈ T to entail a hypothesis term h by a tcehxatin te c, mde tn ∈ote Td by etn →tcai h, thhyep application mof h every r ∈ c must be valid.

The probability that T does not entail h at all (by any chain), specified in Eq. 2, is the probability that all these chains are not valid. Finally, the probability that T entails all of H, assuming independence of H’s terms, is the probability that every h ∈ H is entailed, as given ien p Eq. a3b. Nityot tihceat t ehvaet yth here ∈ c oHul ids be a term h which is not covered by any available rule chain. Under this formulation, we assume that each such h is covered by a single rule coming from a special “resource” called UNCOVERED (expecting θUNCOVERED to be relatively small). p(t −→c h) = Yp(lhs →r rhs) = Yr∈c p(T 9 h) = Y YθR(r)(1) Yr∈c [1 − p(t− →c h)] (2) c∈YC(h) p(T → H) = Y p(T → h) (3) hY∈H As can be seen, our model indeed distinguishes varying resource reliability, decreases entailment probability as rule chains grow and increases it when entailment of a term is supported by multiple chains. The above treatment of uncovered terms in H, as captured in Eq. 3, assumes that their entailment probability is independent of the rest of the hypothesis. However, when the number of covered hypothesis terms increases the probability that the remaining terms are actually entailed by T increases too 560 (even though we do not have supporting knowledge for their entailment). Thus, an alternative model is to group all uncovered terms together and estimate the overall probability of their joint entailment as a function of the lexical coverage of the hypothesis. We denote Hc as the subset of H’s terms which are covered by some rule chain and Huc as the remaining uncovered part. Eq. 3a then provides a refined entailment model for H, in which the second term specifies the probability that Huc is entailed given that Hc is validly entailed and the corresponding lengths: p(T→H) = [Yp(T→h)]·p(T→Huc hY∈Hc 2.2 | |Hc|,|H|) (3a) Parameter Estimation The difficulty in estimating the θR values is that these are term-level parameters while the RTEtraining entailment annotation is given for the sentence-level. Therefore, we use EM-based estimation for the hidden parameters (Dempster et al., 1977). In the E step we use the current θR values to compute all whcr (T, H) values for each training pair. whcr (T, H) stands for the posterior probability that application of the rule r in the chain c for h ∈ H tish valid, given nth oaft heieth reurl eT r e innta thiles c Hha or not ra hcc ∈ord Hing to the training annotation (see Eq. 4). Remember that a rule r provides an entailment relation between its left-hand-side (lhs) and its right-hand-side (rhs). Therefore Eq. 4 uses the notation lhs →r rhs to designate the application of the rule r (similar htos Eq. 1). wEhc:r(T,H)=   p (lTh9→sH−→ |rlhsrp−→ rh(Tsr→9|hTsH )9→p(lhHs−→ r) =hs)if(4T)9→H After applying Bayes’ rule we get a fraction with Eq. 3 in its denominator and θR(r) as the second term of the numerator. The first numerator term is defined as in Eq. 3 except that for the corresponding rule application we substitute θR(r) by 1(per the conditioning event). The probabilistic model defined by Eq. 1-3 is a loop-free directed acyclic graphical model (aka a Bayesian network). Hence the E-step probabilities can be efficiently calculated using the belief propagation algorithm (Pearl, 1988). The M step uses Eq. 5 to update the parameter set. For each resource R we average the whcr (T, H) val- ues for all its rule applications in the training, whose total number is denoted nR.

We also tried initializing the EM algorithm with these direct estimations but did not obtain performance improvements. 3 Evaluations and Results The 5th Recognizing Textual Entailment challenge (RTE-5) introduced a new search task (Bentivogli et al., 2009) which became the main task in RTE6 (Bentivogli et al., 2010). In this task participants should find all sentences that entail a given hypothesis in a given document cluster. This task’s data sets reflect a natural distribution of entailments in a corpus and demonstrate a more realistic scenario than the previous RTE challenges. In our system, sentences are tokenized and stripped of stop words and terms are lemmatized and tagged for part-of-speech. As lexical resources we use WordNet (WN) (Fellbaum, 1998), taking as entailment rules synonyms, derivations, hyponyms and meronyms of the first senses of T and H terms, and the CatVar (Categorial Variation) database (Habash and Dorr, 2003). We allow rule chains of length up to 4 in WordNet (WN4). We compare our model to two types of baselines: (1) RTE published results: the average of the best runs of all systems, the best and second best performing lexical systems and the best full system of each challenge; (2) our implementation of lexical 561 coverage model, tuning the percentage-of-coverage threshold for entailment on the training set. This model uses the same configuration as ourprobabilistic model. We also implemented an Information Re- trieval style baseline3 (both with and without lexical expansions), but given its poorer performance we omit its results here. Table 1 presents the results. We can see that both our implemented models (probabilistic and coverage) outperform all RTE lexical baselines on both data sets, apart from (Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010) which incorporates additional lexical resources, a named entity recognizer and a co-reference system. On RTE-5, the probabilistic model is comparable in performance to the best full system, while the coverage model achieves considerably better results. We notice that our implemented models successfully utilize resources to increase performance, as opposed to typical smaller or less consistent improvements in prior works (see Section 1).

In particular, WN4 performs better than the single-step WN only on RTE-5, suggesting the need to improve the modeling of chain- ing. The fluctuations over the data sets and impacts of resources suggest the need for further investigation over additional data sets and resources. As for the coverage model, under our configuration it poses a bigger challenge for RTE systems than perviously reported baselines. It is thus proposed as an easy to implement baseline for future entailment research. 4 Conclusions and Future Work This paper presented, for the first time, a principled and relatively rich probabilistic model for lexical entailment, amenable for estimation of hidden lexicallevel parameters from standard sentence-level annotations. The positive results of the probabilistic model compared to prior art and its ability to exploit lexical resources indicate its future potential. Yet, further investigation is needed. For example, analyzing current model’s limitations, we observed that the multiplicative nature of eqs. 1and 3 (reflecting independence assumptions) is too restrictive, resembling a logical AND. Accordingly we plan to explore relaxing this strict conjunctive behavior through models such as noisy-AND (Pearl, 1988). We also intend to explore the contribution of our model, and particularly its estimated parameter values, within a complex system that integrates multiple levels of inference.

We propose an automatic method of extracting paraphrases from definition sentences, which are also automatically acquired from the Web. We observe that a huge number of concepts are defined in Web documents, and that the sentences that define the same concept tend to convey mostly the same information using different expressions and thus contain many paraphrases. We show that a large number of paraphrases can be automatically extracted with high precision by regarding the sentences that define the same concept as parallel corpora.

Proposed data-driven solutions to the problem have ranged from simple approaches that make minimal use of NLP tools to more complex approaches that rely on numerous language-dependent resources. Despite all of the attention, there have been very few direct empirical evaluations comparing the merits of the different approaches. This paper empirically examines the tradeoffs between simple and sophisticated paraphrase harvesting approaches to help shed light on their strengths and weaknesses. Our evaluation reveals that very simple approaches fare surprisingly well and have a number of distinct advantages, including strong precision, good coverage, and low redundancy.</p><p>6 0.22584784 <a title="327-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Collecting_Highly_Parallel_Data_for_Paraphrase_Evaluation.html">72 acl-2011-Collecting Highly Parallel Data for Paraphrase Evaluation</a></p>

<p>Author: Yashar Mehdad ; Matteo Negri ; Marcello Federico</p><p>Abstract: This paper explores the use of bilingual parallel corpora as a source of lexical knowledge for cross-lingual textual entailment. We claim that, in spite of the inherent difficulties of the task, phrase tables extracted from parallel data allow to capture both lexical relations between single words, and contextual information useful for inference. We experiment with a phrasal matching method in order to: i) build a system portable across languages, and ii) evaluate the contribution of lexical knowledge in isolation, without interaction with other inference mechanisms. Results achieved on an English-Spanish corpus obtained from the RTE3 dataset support our claim, with an overall accuracy above average scores reported by RTE participants on monolingual data. Finally, we show that using parallel corpora to extract paraphrase tables reveals their potential also in the monolingual setting, improving the results achieved with other sources of lexical knowledge.</p><p>2 0.79427737 <a title="327-lsi-2" href="./acl-2011-Extracting_Paraphrases_from_Definition_Sentences_on_the_Web.html">132 acl-2011-Extracting Paraphrases from Definition Sentences on the Web</a></p>

We propose an automatic method of extracting paraphrases from definition sentences, which are also automatically acquired from the Web. We observe that a huge number of concepts are defined in Web documents, and that the sentences that define the same concept tend to convey mostly the same information using different expressions and thus contain many paraphrases. We show that a large number of paraphrases can be automatically extracted with high precision by regarding the sentences that define the same concept as parallel corpora.

Proposed data-driven solutions to the problem have ranged from simple approaches that make minimal use of NLP tools to more complex approaches that rely on numerous language-dependent resources. Despite all of the attention, there have been very few direct empirical evaluations comparing the merits of the different approaches. This paper empirically examines the tradeoffs between simple and sophisticated paraphrase harvesting approaches to help shed light on their strengths and weaknesses. Our evaluation reveals that very simple approaches fare surprisingly well and have a number of distinct advantages, including strong precision, good coverage, and low redundancy.</p><p>5 0.70166612 <a title="327-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-A_Probabilistic_Modeling_Framework_for_Lexical_Entailment.html">22 acl-2011-A Probabilistic Modeling Framework for Lexical Entailment</a></p>
<p>Author: Eyal Shnarch ; Jacob Goldberger ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing entailment at the lexical level is an important and commonly-addressed component in textual inference. Yet, this task has been mostly approached by simplified heuristic methods. This paper proposes an initial probabilistic modeling framework for lexical entailment, with suitable EM-based parameter estimation. Our model considers prominent entailment factors, including differences in lexical-resources reliability and the impacts of transitivity and multiple evidence. Evaluations show that the proposed model outperforms most prior systems while pointing at required future improvements. 1 Introduction and Background Textual Entailment was proposed as a generic paradigm for applied semantic inference (Dagan et al., 2006). This task requires deciding whether a tex- tual statement (termed the hypothesis-H) can be inferred (entailed) from another text (termed the textT). Since it was first introduced, the six rounds of the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) challenges1 , currently organized under NIST, have become a standard benchmark for entailment systems. These systems tackle their complex task at various levels of inference, including logical representation (Tatu and Moldovan, 2007; MacCartney and Manning, 2007), semantic analysis (Burchardt et al., 2007) and syntactic parsing (Bar-Haim et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009). Inference at these levels usually 1http://www.nist.gov/tac/2010/RTE/index.html 558 requires substantial processing and resources (e.g. parsing) aiming at high performance. Nevertheless, simple entailment methods, performing at the lexical level, provide strong baselines which most systems did not outperform (Mirkin et al., 2009; Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010). Within complex systems, lexical entailment modeling is an important component. Finally, there are cases in which a full system cannot be used (e.g. lacking a parser for a targeted language) and one must resort to the simpler lexical approach. While lexical entailment methods are widely used, most of them apply ad hoc heuristics which do not rely on a principled underlying framework. Typically, such methods quantify the degree of lexical coverage of the hypothesis terms by the text’s terms. Coverage is determined either by a direct match of identical terms in T and H or by utilizing lexical semantic resources, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), that capture lexical entailment relations (denoted here as entailment rules). Common heuristics for quantifying the degree of coverage are setting a threshold on the percentage coverage of H’s terms (Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010), counting absolute number of uncovered terms (Clark and Harrison, 2010), or applying an Information Retrievalstyle vector space similarity score (MacKinlay and Baldwin, 2009). Other works (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005; Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006) have applied a heuristic formula to estimate the similarity between text fragments based on a similarity function between their terms. These heuristics do not capture several important aspects of entailment, such as varying reliability of Proceedings ofP thoer t4l9atnhd A, Onrnuegaoln M,e Jeuntineg 19 o-f2 t4h,e 2 A0s1s1o.c?i ac t2io0n11 fo Ar Cssoocmiaptuiotanti foonra Clo Lminpguutiast i ocns:aslh Loirntpgaupisetrics , pages 558–563, entailment resources and the impact of rule chaining and multiple evidence on entailment likelihood. An additional observation from these and other systems is that their performance improves only moderately when utilizing lexical resources2. We believe that the textual entailment field would benefit from more principled models for various entailment phenomena. Inspired by the earlier steps in the evolution of Statistical Machine Translation methods (such as the initial IBM models (Brown et al., 1993)), we formulate a concrete generative probabilistic modeling framework that captures the basic aspects of lexical entailment. Parameter estimation is addressed by an EM-based approach, which enables estimating the hidden lexical-level entailment parameters from entailment annotations which are available only at the sentence-level. While heuristic methods are limited in their ability to wisely integrate indications for entailment, probabilistic methods have the advantage of being extendable and enabling the utilization of wellfounded probabilistic methods such as the EM algorithm. We compared the performance of several model variations to previously published results on RTE data sets, as well as to our own implementation of typical lexical baselines. Results show that both the probabilistic model and our percentagecoverage baseline perform favorably relative to prior art. These results support the viability of the probabilistic framework while pointing at certain modeling aspects that need to be improved. 2 Probabilistic Model Under the lexical entailment scope, our modeling goal is obtaining a probabilistic score for the likelihood that all H’s terms are entailed by T. To that end, we model prominent aspects of lexical entailment, which were mostly neglected by previous lexical methods: (1) distinguishing different reliability levels of lexical resources; (2) allowing transitive chains of rule applications and considering their length when estimating their validity; and (3) considering multiple entailments when entailing a term. 2See ablation tests reports in http://aclweb.org/aclwiki/ index.php?title=RTE Knowledge Resources#Ablation Tests 559 Figure 1: The generative process of entailing terms of a hypothesis from a text. Edges represent entailment rules. There are 3 evidences for the entailment of hi :a rule from Resource1 , another one from Resource3 both suggesting that tj entails it, and a chain from t1through an intermediate term t0. 2.1 Model Description For T to entail H it is usually a necessary, but not sufficient, that every term h ∈ H would be entsauiflefidci by ,at t hleatast e one t teerrmm mt h ∈ ∈T (Glickman eet al., 2006). Figure s1t odneescr tiebrmes tth ∈e process komf entailing hypothesis terms. The trivial case is when identical terms, possibly at the stem or lemma level, appear in T and H (a direct match as tn and hm in Figure 1). Alternatively, we can establish entailment based on knowledge of entailing lexical-semantic relations, such as synonyms, hypernyms and morphological derivations, available in lexical resources (e.g the rule inference → reasoning from WordNet). (We.eg d theneo rutel by R(r) cthee → resource nwgh ficroh provided teht)e. rule r. Since entailment is a transitive relation, rules may compose transitive chains that connect a term t ∈ T ctoo a pteosrme rha ∈ Hive through hinatte cromnendeicatte a tteerrmms. t ∈Fo Tr instance, fr hom ∈ t hHe r thurleosu infer → inference armnds inference → reasoning we can dre →duc inef tehreen rcuele a infer → reasoning (were inference dise dthuec ein thteerm rueldeia intef trer →m as t0 in Figure 1). Multiple chains may connect t to h (as for tj and hi in Figure 1) or connect several terms in T to h (as t1 and tj are indicating the entailment of hi in Figure 1), thus providing multiple evidence for h’s entailment. It is reasonable to expect that if a term t indeed entails a term h, it is likely to find evidences for this relation in several resources. Taking a probabilistic perspective, we assume a parameter θR for each resource R, denoting its reliability, i.e. the prior probability that applying a rule from R corresponds to a valid entailment instance. Direct matches are considered as a special “resource”, called MATCH, for which θMATCH is expected to be close to 1. We now present our probabilistic model. For a text term t ∈ T to entail a hypothesis term h by a tcehxatin te c, mde tn ∈ote Td by etn →tcai h, thhyep application mof h every r ∈ c must be valid.

The probability that T does not entail h at all (by any chain), specified in Eq. 2, is the probability that all these chains are not valid. Finally, the probability that T entails all of H, assuming independence of H’s terms, is the probability that every h ∈ H is entailed, as given ien p Eq. a3b. Nityot tihceat t ehvaet yth here ∈ c oHul ids be a term h which is not covered by any available rule chain. Under this formulation, we assume that each such h is covered by a single rule coming from a special “resource” called UNCOVERED (expecting θUNCOVERED to be relatively small). p(t −→c h) = Yp(lhs →r rhs) = Yr∈c p(T 9 h) = Y YθR(r)(1) Yr∈c [1 − p(t− →c h)] (2) c∈YC(h) p(T → H) = Y p(T → h) (3) hY∈H As can be seen, our model indeed distinguishes varying resource reliability, decreases entailment probability as rule chains grow and increases it when entailment of a term is supported by multiple chains. The above treatment of uncovered terms in H, as captured in Eq. 3, assumes that their entailment probability is independent of the rest of the hypothesis. However, when the number of covered hypothesis terms increases the probability that the remaining terms are actually entailed by T increases too 560 (even though we do not have supporting knowledge for their entailment). Thus, an alternative model is to group all uncovered terms together and estimate the overall probability of their joint entailment as a function of the lexical coverage of the hypothesis. We denote Hc as the subset of H’s terms which are covered by some rule chain and Huc as the remaining uncovered part. Eq. 3a then provides a refined entailment model for H, in which the second term specifies the probability that Huc is entailed given that Hc is validly entailed and the corresponding lengths: p(T→H) = [Yp(T→h)]·p(T→Huc hY∈Hc 2.2 | |Hc|,|H|) (3a) Parameter Estimation The difficulty in estimating the θR values is that these are term-level parameters while the RTEtraining entailment annotation is given for the sentence-level. Therefore, we use EM-based estimation for the hidden parameters (Dempster et al., 1977). In the E step we use the current θR values to compute all whcr (T, H) values for each training pair. whcr (T, H) stands for the posterior probability that application of the rule r in the chain c for h ∈ H tish valid, given nth oaft heieth reurl eT r e innta thiles c Hha or not ra hcc ∈ord Hing to the training annotation (see Eq. 4). Remember that a rule r provides an entailment relation between its left-hand-side (lhs) and its right-hand-side (rhs). Therefore Eq. 4 uses the notation lhs →r rhs to designate the application of the rule r (similar htos Eq. 1). wEhc:r(T,H)=   p (lTh9→sH−→ |rlhsrp−→ rh(Tsr→9|hTsH )9→p(lhHs−→ r) =hs)if(4T)9→H After applying Bayes’ rule we get a fraction with Eq. 3 in its denominator and θR(r) as the second term of the numerator. The first numerator term is defined as in Eq. 3 except that for the corresponding rule application we substitute θR(r) by 1(per the conditioning event). The probabilistic model defined by Eq. 1-3 is a loop-free directed acyclic graphical model (aka a Bayesian network). Hence the E-step probabilities can be efficiently calculated using the belief propagation algorithm (Pearl, 1988). The M step uses Eq. 5 to update the parameter set. For each resource R we average the whcr (T, H) val- ues for all its rule applications in the training, whose total number is denoted nR.

We also tried initializing the EM algorithm with these direct estimations but did not obtain performance improvements. 3 Evaluations and Results The 5th Recognizing Textual Entailment challenge (RTE-5) introduced a new search task (Bentivogli et al., 2009) which became the main task in RTE6 (Bentivogli et al., 2010). In this task participants should find all sentences that entail a given hypothesis in a given document cluster. This task’s data sets reflect a natural distribution of entailments in a corpus and demonstrate a more realistic scenario than the previous RTE challenges. In our system, sentences are tokenized and stripped of stop words and terms are lemmatized and tagged for part-of-speech. As lexical resources we use WordNet (WN) (Fellbaum, 1998), taking as entailment rules synonyms, derivations, hyponyms and meronyms of the first senses of T and H terms, and the CatVar (Categorial Variation) database (Habash and Dorr, 2003). We allow rule chains of length up to 4 in WordNet (WN4). We compare our model to two types of baselines: (1) RTE published results: the average of the best runs of all systems, the best and second best performing lexical systems and the best full system of each challenge; (2) our implementation of lexical 561 coverage model, tuning the percentage-of-coverage threshold for entailment on the training set. This model uses the same configuration as ourprobabilistic model. We also implemented an Information Re- trieval style baseline3 (both with and without lexical expansions), but given its poorer performance we omit its results here. Table 1 presents the results. We can see that both our implemented models (probabilistic and coverage) outperform all RTE lexical baselines on both data sets, apart from (Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010) which incorporates additional lexical resources, a named entity recognizer and a co-reference system. On RTE-5, the probabilistic model is comparable in performance to the best full system, while the coverage model achieves considerably better results. We notice that our implemented models successfully utilize resources to increase performance, as opposed to typical smaller or less consistent improvements in prior works (see Section 1).

In particular, WN4 performs better than the single-step WN only on RTE-5, suggesting the need to improve the modeling of chain- ing. The fluctuations over the data sets and impacts of resources suggest the need for further investigation over additional data sets and resources. As for the coverage model, under our configuration it poses a bigger challenge for RTE systems than perviously reported baselines. It is thus proposed as an easy to implement baseline for future entailment research. 4 Conclusions and Future Work This paper presented, for the first time, a principled and relatively rich probabilistic model for lexical entailment, amenable for estimation of hidden lexicallevel parameters from standard sentence-level annotations. The positive results of the probabilistic model compared to prior art and its ability to exploit lexical resources indicate its future potential. Yet, further investigation is needed. For example, analyzing current model’s limitations, we observed that the multiplicative nature of eqs. 1and 3 (reflecting independence assumptions) is too restrictive, resembling a logical AND. Accordingly we plan to explore relaxing this strict conjunctive behavior through models such as noisy-AND (Pearl, 1988). We also intend to explore the contribution of our model, and particularly its estimated parameter values, within a complex system that integrates multiple levels of inference.

<p>Author: Edward Benson ; Aria Haghighi ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method for record extraction from social streams such as Twitter. Unlike typical extraction setups, these environments are characterized by short, one sentence messages with heavily colloquial speech. To further complicate matters, individual messages may not express the full relation to be uncovered, as is often assumed in extraction tasks. We develop a graphical model that addresses these problems by learning a latent set of records and a record-message alignment simultaneously; the output of our model is a set of canonical records, the values of which are consistent with aligned messages. We demonstrate that our approach is able to accurately induce event records from Twitter messages, evaluated against events from a local city guide. Our method achieves significant error reduction over baseline methods.1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.8502962 <a title="327-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Using_Bilingual_Parallel_Corpora_for_Cross-Lingual_Textual_Entailment.html">327 acl-2011-Using Bilingual Parallel Corpora for Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment</a></p>
<p>Author: Yashar Mehdad ; Matteo Negri ; Marcello Federico</p><p>Abstract: This paper explores the use of bilingual parallel corpora as a source of lexical knowledge for cross-lingual textual entailment. We claim that, in spite of the inherent difficulties of the task, phrase tables extracted from parallel data allow to capture both lexical relations between single words, and contextual information useful for inference. We experiment with a phrasal matching method in order to: i) build a system portable across languages, and ii) evaluate the contribution of lexical knowledge in isolation, without interaction with other inference mechanisms. Results achieved on an English-Spanish corpus obtained from the RTE3 dataset support our claim, with an overall accuracy above average scores reported by RTE participants on monolingual data. Finally, we show that using parallel corpora to extract paraphrase tables reveals their potential also in the monolingual setting, improving the results achieved with other sources of lexical knowledge.</p><p>3 0.82458925 <a title="327-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Identifying_the_Semantic_Orientation_of_Foreign_Words.html">162 acl-2011-Identifying the Semantic Orientation of Foreign Words</a></p>
<p>Author: Ahmed Hassan ; Amjad AbuJbara ; Rahul Jha ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for identifying the positive or negative semantic orientation of foreign words. Identifying the semantic orientation of words has numerous applications in the areas of text classification, analysis of product review, analysis of responses to surveys, and mining online discussions. Identifying the semantic orientation of English words has been extensively studied in literature. Most of this work assumes the existence of resources (e.g. Wordnet, seeds, etc) that do not exist in foreign languages. In this work, we describe a method based on constructing a multilingual network connecting English and foreign words. We use this network to identify the semantic orientation of foreign words based on connection between words in the same language as well as multilingual connections. The method is experimentally tested using a manually labeled set of positive and negative words and has shown very promising results.</p><p>4 0.80156767 <a title="327-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Joint_Annotation_of_Search_Queries.html">182 acl-2011-Joint Annotation of Search Queries</a></p>

Smith Dept. of Computer Science University of Massachusetts Amherst, MA dasmith@ c s .umas s .edu articles or web pages). As previous research shows, these differences severely limit the applicability of Marking up search queries with linguistic annotations such as part-of-speech tags, capitalization, and segmentation, is an impor- tant part of query processing and understanding in information retrieval systems. Due to their brevity and idiosyncratic structure, search queries pose a challenge to existing NLP tools. To address this challenge, we propose a probabilistic approach for performing joint query annotation. First, we derive a robust set of unsupervised independent annotations, using queries and pseudo-relevance feedback. Then, we stack additional classifiers on the independent annotations, and exploit the dependencies between them to further improve the accuracy, even with a very limited amount of available training data. We evaluate our method using a range of queries extracted from a web search log. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our approach for both short keyword queries, and verbose natural language queries.</p><p>5 0.79230899 <a title="327-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Shift-Reduce_CCG_Parsing.html">282 acl-2011-Shift-Reduce CCG Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Yue Zhang ; Stephen Clark</p><p>Abstract: CCGs are directly compatible with binarybranching bottom-up parsing algorithms, in particular CKY and shift-reduce algorithms. While the chart-based approach has been the dominant approach for CCG, the shift-reduce method has been little explored. In this paper, we develop a shift-reduce CCG parser using a discriminative model and beam search, and compare its strengths and weaknesses with the chart-based C&C; parser. We study different errors made by the two parsers, and show that the shift-reduce parser gives competitive accuracies compared to C&C.; Considering our use of a small beam, and given the high ambiguity levels in an automatically-extracted grammar and the amount of information in the CCG lexical categories which form the shift actions, this is a surprising result.</p><p>6 0.7900911 <a title="327-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Extracting_Paraphrases_from_Definition_Sentences_on_the_Web.html">132 acl-2011-Extracting Paraphrases from Definition Sentences on the Web</a></p>

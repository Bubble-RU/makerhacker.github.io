</p><p>4 1 Introduction Micro-blogging services such as Twitter1, Plurk2,  and Jaiku3, are platforms that allow users to share immediate but short messages with friends. [sent-12, score-0.248]
</p><p>5 The temporal information is crucial because contextual posts that appear close together are, to some extent, correlated. [sent-18, score-0.367]

</p><p>7 This phenomenon indicates that the posts and their responses are highly correlated in many respects. [sent-28, score-0.459]
</p><p>8 Posts from a particular user can also be viewed by his/her friends and might have an impact on them (e. [sent-30, score-0.173]
</p><p>9 Therefore, posts from friends in the same period may be correlated sentiment-wise as well as content-wise. [sent-33, score-0.513]
</p><p>10 We leverage the above properties to develop an automatic and intuitive Web application, MemeTube, to analyze and display the sentiments behind messages in microblogs. [sent-34, score-0.325]
</p><p>11 Our system can be regarded as a sentiment-driven, music-based summarization framework as well as a novel audiovisual presentation of art. [sent-35, score-0.304]
</p><p>12 Given a query (either a keyword or a user id), the system first extracts a series of relevant posts and replies based on keyword matching. [sent-38, score-0.528]
</p><p>13 Then sentiment analysis is applied to determine the sentiment of the posts. [sent-39, score-0.786]
</p><p>14 Next a piece of music is composed to reflect the detected sentiments. [sent-40, score-0.338]
</p><p>15 Finally, the messages and music are fed into the animation generation model, which displays a piano keyboard that plays automatically. [sent-41, score-0.639]

</p><p>22 Related Works  Related works can be divided into two parts: sentiment classification in microblogs, and sentimentbased audiovisual presentation for social media. [sent-58, score-0.664]
</p><p>23 For the first part, most of related literatures focus on exploiting different classification methods to separate positive and negative sentiments by a variety of textual and linguistics features, as shown in Table 1. [sent-59, score-0.289]
</p><p>24 In recent years, a number of studies have investigated integrating emotions and music in certain media applications. [sent-64, score-0.3]
</p><p>25 For example, Ishizuka and Onisawa (2006) generated variations of theme music to fit the impressions of story scenes represented by textual content or pictures. [sent-65, score-0.337]
</p><p>26 Kaminskas (2009) aligned music with user-selected points of interests for recommendation. [sent-66, score-0.262]

</p><p>28 Table 1: Summary of related works that detect sentiments in microblogs. [sent-71, score-0.202]
</p><p>29 3  Sentiment Analysis of Microblog Posts  First, we develop a classification model as our basic sentiment recognition mechanism. [sent-72, score-0.42]
</p><p>30 Given a training corpus of posts and responses annotated with sentiment labels, we train an n-gram language model for each sentiment. [sent-73, score-0.81]
</p><p>31 Then, we use such model to calculate the probability that a post expresses the sentiment s associated with that model: ? [sent-74, score-0.68]
</p><p>32 For each post p and each sentiment sS, our classifier calculates the probability that such post expresses the sentiment ? [sent-117, score-1.314]
</p><p>33 This allow us to produce a distribution of sentiments for a given post p, denoted as ? [sent-153, score-0.481]
</p><p>34 However, the major challenge in the microblog sentiment detection task is that the length of each post is limited (i. [sent-156, score-0.813]
</p><p>35 , posts on Twitter are limited to  140 characters). [sent-158, score-0.336]
</p><p>36 Consequently, there might not be enough information for a sentiment detection system to exploit. [sent-159, score-0.423]
</p><p>37 1 Response Factor We believe the sentiment of a post is highly correlated with (but not necessary similar to) that of responses to the post. [sent-163, score-0.757]
</p><p>38 For example, an angry post usually triggers angry responses, but a sad post usually solicits supportive responses. [sent-164, score-0.596]
</p><p>39 We propose to learn the correlation patterns of sentiments from the data and use them to improve the recognition. [sent-165, score-0.202]
</p><p>40 , which represents the conditional probability of a post given responses. [sent-199, score-0.273]
</p><p>41 , we can generate the adjusted sentiment distribution of the post ? [sent-248, score-0.701]
</p><p>42 denotes the original sentiment distribution of the post, and ? [sent-275, score-0.431]
</p><p>43 2  Context Factor  It is assumed that the sentiment of a microblog post is correlated with the author’s previous posts (i. [sent-313, score-1.191]
</p><p>44 We also assume that, for each person, there is a sentiment transition matrix ? [sent-316, score-0.486]
</p><p>45 represents the conditional probability from the sentiment of the previous post to that of the current post: ? [sent-327, score-0.666]
</p><p>46 represent the detected sentiment distribution of an existing post at time t. [sent-374, score-0.702]
</p><p>47 The system first extracts a set of posts from the same author posted from time ? [sent-383, score-0.396]
</p><p>48 Then, the system utilizes the following update equation to obtain an adjusted sentiment distribution ? [sent-411, score-0.49]
</p><p>49 If there is no post in the defined interval, the system will leave ? [sent-452, score-0.271]
</p><p>50 This is because friends affect each other, and they are more likely to be in the same circumstances, and thus enjoy/suffer sim-  ilarly. [sent-457, score-0.135]
</p><p>51 Our hypothesis is that the sentiment of a post and the sentiments of the author’s friends’ recent posts might be correlated. [sent-458, score-1.172]
</p><p>52 Therefore, we can treat the friends’ recent posts in the same way as the recent posts of the author, and learn the transition matrix? [sent-459, score-0.72]
</p><p>53 However, it is not necessarily true that all friends have similar emotional patterns. [sent-517, score-0.184]
</p><p>54 We propose to only consider posts from friends with similar emotional patterns. [sent-521, score-0.52]
</p><p>55 To achieve our goal, we first learn every user’s contextual sentiment transition matrix ? [sent-522, score-0.517]
</p><p>56 Two persons are considered as having similar  emotion pattern if their contextual sentiment transition matrixes are similar. [sent-583, score-0.589]
</p><p>57 After a set of similar friends are identified, their recent posts (i. [sent-584, score-0.471]
</p><p>58 ) are treated in the same way as the posts by the author, and we use the method proposed previously to fine-tune the recognition outcomes. [sent-590, score-0.336]
</p><p>59 4  Music Generation  For each microblog post retrieved according to the query, we can derive its sentiment distribution (as a vector of probabilities) by using the above method. [sent-591, score-0.883]
</p><p>60 Next, the system transforms every sentiment distribution into an affective vector comprised of a valence value and an arousal value. [sent-592, score-1.038]
</p><p>61 The valence value represents the positive-to-negative sentiment, while the arousal value represents the intense-tosilent level. [sent-593, score-0.406]
</p><p>62 We exploit the mapping from each type of sentiment to a two-dimensional affective vector based on the two-dimensional emotion model of Russell (1980). [sent-594, score-0.703]
</p><p>63 Using the model we extract the affective score vectors of the six emotions (see Table 2) used in our experiments. [sent-595, score-0.213]
</p><p>64 The mapping enables us to transform a sentiment distribution ? [sent-596, score-0.431]
</p><p>65 into an affective score vector by weighted sum approach. [sent-598, score-0.207]
</p><p>66 For example, given a distribution of (Anger=20%, Surprise=20%,Disgust=10%, Fear=10%, Joy=10%, Sadness=30%), the two-dimensional affective vector can be computed as 0. [sent-599, score-0.245]
</p><p>67 Finally, the affective vector of each post will be summed to represent the sentiment of the given query in terms of the valence and arousal values. [sent-615, score-1.237]
</p><p>68 Table 2: Affective score vector for each sentiment label. [sent-616, score-0.425]
</p><p>69 )5V ector  Next the system transforms the affective vector into music elements through chord set selection (based on the valence value) and rhythm determi35 nation (based on the arousal value). [sent-621, score-1.055]
</p><p>70 For chord set selection, we design nine basic chord sets as {A,  Am, Bm, C, D, Dm, Em, F, G} , where each chord set consists of some basic notes. [sent-622, score-0.456]
</p><p>71 The chord sets are used to compose twenty chord sequences. [sent-623, score-0.334]
</p><p>72 Half of the chord sequences are used for weakly positive to strongly positive sentiments and the other half are used for weakly negative to strongly negative sentiments. [sent-624, score-0.532]
</p><p>73 The valence value is therefore divided into twenty levels, and gradually shifts from strongly positive to strongly negative. [sent-625, score-0.273]
</p><p>74 The chord sets ensure that the resulting auditory presentation is in harmony (Hewitt 2008). [sent-626, score-0.208]
</p><p>75 For rhythm determination, we divide the arousal values into five levels to decide the tempo/speed of the music. [sent-627, score-0.22]
</p><p>76 Higher arousal values generate music with a faster tempo while lower ones lead to slow and easy-listening music. [sent-628, score-0.448]
</p><p>77 5  Animation Generation  In this final stage, our system produces real-time animation for visualization. [sent-630, score-0.163]
</p><p>78 The streams of messages are designed to flow as if they were playing a piece of a piano melody. [sent-631, score-0.394]
</p><p>79 When a post message flows from right to left and touches a piano key, the key itself blinks once and the corresponding tone of the key is produced. [sent-633, score-0.364]
</p><p>80 The message flow and the chord/rhythm have to be synchronized so that it looks as if the messages themselves are playing the piano. [sent-634, score-0.247]
</p><p>81 A snapshot is shown in Figure 2 and the sequential snapshots of the animation are shown in Figure 3. [sent-636, score-0.133]
</p><p>82 6  Evaluations on Sentiment Detection  We collect the posts and responses from every effective user, users with more than 10 messages, of Plurk from January 3 1st to May 23rd, 2009. [sent-637, score-0.474]
</p><p>83 In order to create the diversity for the music generation system, we decide to use six different sentiments, as shown in Table 2, rather than using only three sentiment types, positive, negative and neutral, as most of the systems in Table 1 have used. [sent-638, score-0.713]
</p><p>84 The sentiment of each sentence is labeled automatically using the emoticons. [sent-639, score-0.393]
</p><p>85 For the purpose of observing the result of using the three factors, we filter the users without friends, the posts without responses, and the posts without previous post in 24 hour in testing data. [sent-646, score-0.97]
</p><p>86 We also manually label the sentiments on the testing data (totally 1200 posts, 200 posts for each sentiment). [sent-647, score-0.538]
</p><p>87 We use three metrics to evaluate our model: accuracy, Root-Mean-Square Error for valence (denoted by RMSE(V)) and RMSE for arousal (denoted by RMSE(A)). [sent-648, score-0.342]
</p><p>88 The RMSE values are generated by comparing the affective vector of the predicted sentiment distribution with the affective vector of the answer. [sent-649, score-0.845]
</p><p>89 This demo page contains the resulting clips of four  keyword queries (including football, volcano, Monday, big bang) and a user id query mstcgeek. [sent-675, score-0.23]
</p><p>90 (1) The video for query term, football, was recorded on February 7th 2011, results in a relatively positive and extremely intense atmosphere. [sent-677, score-0.143]
</p><p>91 The valence value is not as high as the arousal value because some fans might not be very happy to see their favorite team losing the game. [sent-679, score-0.342]
</p><p>92 The resulting video expresses negative valence and neutral arousal. [sent-681, score-0.298]
</p><p>93 The negative valence reflects the “blue Monday” phenomenon, which leads to some heavy, less smooth melody. [sent-685, score-0.187]
</p><p>94 (4) The term big bang turns out to be very positive on both valence and arousal, mainly because, besides its relatively neutral meaning in physics, this term also refers to a famous comic show that some people in Plurk love to watch. [sent-686, score-0.256]
</p><p>95 8 Conclusion Microblog, as a daily journey and social networking service, generally captures the dynamics of the change of feelings over time of the authors and their friends. [sent-689, score-0.138]
</p><p>96 In MemeTube, the affective vector is generated by aggregating the sentiment distribution of each post; thus, it represents the majority’s opinion (or sentiment) about a topic. [sent-690, score-0.695]
</p><p>97 In this sense, our system can be regarded as providing users with an audiovisual experience to learn collective opinion of a particular topic. [sent-691, score-0.33]
</p><p>98 It also shows how NLP techniques can be integrated with knowledge about music and visualization to create a piece of interesting network art work. [sent-692, score-0.349]
</p><p>99 Therefore, our future works are threefold: For sentiment analysis, we will consider more sophisticated ways to improve the baseline accuracy and to aggregate individual posts into a collective consensus. [sent-694, score-0.729]
</p><p>100 For music generation, we plan to add more instruments and exploit learning ap-  proaches to improve the selection of chords. [sent-695, score-0.295]

<p>Author: Jui-Yu Weng ; Cheng-Lun Yang ; Bo-Nian Chen ; Yen-Kai Wang ; Shou-De Lin</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a system to summarize a Microblog post and its responses with the goal to provide readers a more constructive and concise set of information for efficient digestion. We introduce a novel two-phase summarization scheme. In the first phase, the post plus its responses are classified into four categories based on the intention, interrogation, sharing, discussion and chat. For each type of post, in the second phase, we exploit different strategies, including opinion analysis, response pair identification, and response relevancy detection, to summarize and highlight critical information to display. This system provides an alternative thinking about machinesummarization: by utilizing AI approaches, computers are capable of constructing deeper and more user-friendly abstraction. 1</p><p>3 0.28405732 <a title="218-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Target-dependent_Twitter_Sentiment_Classification.html">292 acl-2011-Target-dependent Twitter Sentiment Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Long Jiang ; Mo Yu ; Ming Zhou ; Xiaohua Liu ; Tiejun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: Sentiment analysis on Twitter data has attracted much attention recently. In this paper, we focus on target-dependent Twitter sentiment classification; namely, given a query, we classify the sentiments of the tweets as positive, negative or neutral according to whether they contain positive, negative or neutral sentiments about that query. Here the query serves as the target of the sentiments. The state-ofthe-art approaches for solving this problem always adopt the target-independent strategy, which may assign irrelevant sentiments to the given target. Moreover, the state-of-the-art approaches only take the tweet to be classified into consideration when classifying the sentiment; they ignore its context (i.e., related tweets). However, because tweets are usually short and more ambiguous, sometimes it is not enough to consider only the current tweet for sentiment classification. In this paper, we propose to improve target-dependent Twitter sentiment classification by 1) incorporating target-dependent features; and 2) taking related tweets into consideration. According to the experimental results, our approach greatly improves the performance of target-dependent sentiment classification. 1</p><p>4 0.26762694 <a title="218-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Using_Multiple_Sources_to_Construct_a_Sentiment_Sensitive_Thesaurus_for_Cross-Domain_Sentiment_Classification.html">332 acl-2011-Using Multiple Sources to Construct a Sentiment Sensitive Thesaurus for Cross-Domain Sentiment Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Danushka Bollegala ; David Weir ; John Carroll</p><p>Abstract: We describe a sentiment classification method that is applicable when we do not have any labeled data for a target domain but have some labeled data for multiple other domains, designated as the source domains. We automat- ically create a sentiment sensitive thesaurus using both labeled and unlabeled data from multiple source domains to find the association between words that express similar sentiments in different domains. The created thesaurus is then used to expand feature vectors to train a binary classifier. Unlike previous cross-domain sentiment classification methods, our method can efficiently learn from multiple source domains. Our method significantly outperforms numerous baselines and returns results that are better than or comparable to previous cross-domain sentiment classification methods on a benchmark dataset containing Amazon user reviews for different types of products.</p><p>5 0.25761369 <a title="218-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Learning_Word_Vectors_for_Sentiment_Analysis.html">204 acl-2011-Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis</a></p>

Ng ; Christopher Potts</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised vector-based approaches to semantics can model rich lexical meanings, but they largely fail to capture sentiment information that is central to many word meanings and important for a wide range of NLP tasks. We present a model that uses a mix of unsupervised and supervised techniques to learn word vectors capturing semanticterm–documentinformation as well as rich sentiment content. The proposed model can leverage both continuous and multi-dimensional sentiment information as well as non-sentiment annotations.

<p>Author: Long Jiang ; Mo Yu ; Ming Zhou ; Xiaohua Liu ; Tiejun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: Sentiment analysis on Twitter data has attracted much attention recently. In this paper, we focus on target-dependent Twitter sentiment classification; namely, given a query, we classify the sentiments of the tweets as positive, negative or neutral according to whether they contain positive, negative or neutral sentiments about that query. Here the query serves as the target of the sentiments. The state-ofthe-art approaches for solving this problem always adopt the target-independent strategy, which may assign irrelevant sentiments to the given target. Moreover, the state-of-the-art approaches only take the tweet to be classified into consideration when classifying the sentiment; they ignore its context (i.e., related tweets). However, because tweets are usually short and more ambiguous, sometimes it is not enough to consider only the current tweet for sentiment classification. In this paper, we propose to improve target-dependent Twitter sentiment classification by 1) incorporating target-dependent features; and 2) taking related tweets into consideration. According to the experimental results, our approach greatly improves the performance of target-dependent sentiment classification. 1</p><p>3 0.67476302 <a title="218-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-C-Feel-It%3A_A_Sentiment_Analyzer_for_Micro-blogs.html">64 acl-2011-C-Feel-It: A Sentiment Analyzer for Micro-blogs</a></p>
<p>Author: Aditya Joshi ; Balamurali AR ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya ; Rajat Mohanty</p><p>Abstract: Social networking and micro-blogging sites are stores of opinion-bearing content created by human users. We describe C-Feel-It, a system which can tap opinion content in posts (called tweets) from the micro-blogging website, Twitter. This web-based system categorizes tweets pertaining to a search string as positive, negative or objective and gives an aggregate sentiment score that represents a sentiment snapshot for a search string. We present a qualitative evaluation of this system based on a human-annotated tweet corpus.</p><p>4 0.64926898 <a title="218-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-IMASS%3A_An_Intelligent_Microblog_Analysis_and_Summarization_System.html">156 acl-2011-IMASS: An Intelligent Microblog Analysis and Summarization System</a></p>

<p>Author: Andrew L. Maas ; Raymond E. Daly ; Peter T. Pham ; Dan Huang ; Andrew Y. Ng ; Christopher Potts</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised vector-based approaches to semantics can model rich lexical meanings, but they largely fail to capture sentiment information that is central to many word meanings and important for a wide range of NLP tasks. We present a model that uses a mix of unsupervised and supervised techniques to learn word vectors capturing semanticterm–documentinformation as well as rich sentiment content. The proposed model can leverage both continuous and multi-dimensional sentiment information as well as non-sentiment annotations. We instantiate the model to utilize the document-level sentiment polarity annotations present in many online documents (e.g. star ratings). We evaluate the model using small, widely used sentiment and subjectivity corpora and find it out-performs several previously introduced methods for sentiment classification.

<p>Author: Gregory Brown</p><p>Abstract: Relation extraction in documents allows the detection of how entities being discussed in a document are related to one another (e.g. partof). This paper presents an analysis of a relation extraction system based on prior work but applied to the J.D. Power and Associates Sentiment Corpus to examine how the system works on documents from a range of social media. The results are examined on three different subsets of the JDPA Corpus, showing that the system performs much worse on documents from certain sources. The proposed explanation is that the features used are more appropriate to text with strong editorial standards than the informal writing style of blogs.</p><p>3 0.67385739 <a title="218-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Towards_a_Framework_for_Abstractive_Summarization_of_Multimodal_Documents.html">308 acl-2011-Towards a Framework for Abstractive Summarization of Multimodal Documents</a></p>

We discuss the type of model required, the means by which it can be constructed, how the content of the model is rated and selected, and the method of realizing novel sentences for the summary. To this end, we introduce a metric called information density used for gauging the importance of content obtained from text and graphical sources.</p><p>4 0.58422559 <a title="218-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-IMASS%3A_An_Intelligent_Microblog_Analysis_and_Summarization_System.html">156 acl-2011-IMASS: An Intelligent Microblog Analysis and Summarization System</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhuowei Bao ; Benny Kimelfeld ; Yunyao Li</p><p>Abstract: Spelling correction for keyword-search queries is challenging in restricted domains such as personal email (or desktop) search, due to the scarcity of query logs, and due to the specialized nature of the domain. For that task, this paper presents an algorithm that is based on statistics from the corpus data (rather than the query log). This algorithm, which employs a simple graph-based approach, can incorporate different types of data sources with different levels of reliability (e.g., email subject vs. email body), and can handle complex spelling errors like splitting and merging of words. An experimental study shows the superiority of the algorithm over existing alternatives in the email domain.</p><p>6 0.58082962 <a title="218-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Extracting_Social_Power_Relationships_from_Natural_Language.html">133 acl-2011-Extracting Social Power Relationships from Natural Language</a></p>

<p>Author: Hao Zhang ; Licheng Fang ; Peng Xu ; Xiaoyun Wu</p><p>Abstract: Tree-to-string translation is syntax-aware and efficient but sensitive to parsing errors. Forestto-string translation approaches mitigate the risk of propagating parser errors into translation errors by considering a forest of alternative trees, as generated by a source language parser. We propose an alternative approach to generating forests that is based on combining sub-trees within the first best parse through binarization. Provably, our binarization forest can cover any non-consitituent phrases in a sentence but maintains the desirable property that for each span there is at most one nonterminal so that the grammar constant for decoding is relatively small. For the purpose of reducing search errors, we apply the synchronous binarization technique to forest-tostring decoding. Combining the two techniques, we show that using a fast shift-reduce parser we can achieve significant quality gains in NIST 2008 English-to-Chinese track (1.3 BLEU points over a phrase-based system, 0.8 BLEU points over a hierarchical phrase-based system). Consistent and significant gains are also shown in WMT 2010 in the English to German, French, Spanish and Czech tracks.</p><p>3 0.34957379 <a title="30-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Effective_Use_of_Function_Words_for_Rule_Generalization_in_Forest-Based_Translation.html">110 acl-2011-Effective Use of Function Words for Rule Generalization in Forest-Based Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Xianchao Wu ; Takuya Matsuzaki ; Jun'ichi Tsujii</p><p>Abstract: In the present paper, we propose the effective usage of function words to generate generalized translation rules for forest-based translation. Given aligned forest-string pairs, we extract composed tree-to-string translation rules that account for multiple interpretations of both aligned and unaligned target function words. In order to constrain the exhaustive attachments of function words, we limit to bind them to the nearby syntactic chunks yielded by a target dependency parser. Therefore, the proposed approach can not only capture source-tree-to-target-chunk correspondences but can also use forest structures that compactly encode an exponential number of parse trees to properly generate target function words during decoding. Extensive experiments involving large-scale English-toJapanese translation revealed a significant im- provement of 1.8 points in BLEU score, as compared with a strong forest-to-string baseline system.</p><p>4 0.31765255 <a title="30-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Rule_Markov_Models_for_Fast_Tree-to-String_Translation.html">268 acl-2011-Rule Markov Models for Fast Tree-to-String Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ashish Vaswani ; Haitao Mi ; Liang Huang ; David Chiang</p><p>Abstract: Most statistical machine translation systems rely on composed rules (rules that can be formed out of smaller rules in the grammar). Though this practice improves translation by weakening independence assumptions in the translation model, it nevertheless results in huge, redundant grammars, making both training and decoding inefficient. Here, we take the opposite approach, where we only use minimal rules (those that cannot be formed out of other rules), and instead rely on a rule Markov model of the derivation history to capture dependencies between minimal rules. Large-scale experiments on a state-of-the-art tree-to-string translation system show that our approach leads to a slimmer model, a faster decoder, yet the same translation quality (measured using B ) as composed rules.</p><p>5 0.26749733 <a title="30-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Learning_to_Transform_and_Select_Elementary_Trees_for_Improved_Syntax-based_Machine_Translations.html">206 acl-2011-Learning to Transform and Select Elementary Trees for Improved Syntax-based Machine Translations</a></p>
<p>Author: Bing Zhao ; Young-Suk Lee ; Xiaoqiang Luo ; Liu Li</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel technique of learning how to transform the source parse trees to improve the translation qualities of syntax-based translation models using synchronous context-free grammars. We transform the source tree phrasal structure into a set of simpler structures, expose such decisions to the decoding process, and find the least expensive transformation operation to better model word reordering. In particular, we integrate synchronous binarizations, verb regrouping, removal of redundant parse nodes, and incorporate a few important features such as translation boundaries. We learn the structural preferences from the data in a generative framework. The syntax-based translation system integrating the proposed techniques outperforms the best Arabic-English unconstrained system in NIST08 evaluations by 1.3 absolute BLEU, which is statistically significant.</p><p>6 0.23863675 <a title="30-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Insertion_Operator_for_Bayesian_Tree_Substitution_Grammars.html">173 acl-2011-Insertion Operator for Bayesian Tree Substitution Grammars</a></p>

It is then shown how to obtain a weighted local multi bottom-up tree transducer from a bilingual and biparsed corpus. Finally, the problem of non-preservation of regularity is addressed. Three properties that ensure preservation are introduced, and it is discussed how to adjust the rule extraction process such that they are automatically fulfilled.</p><p>6 0.74489701 <a title="30-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Machine_Translation_System_Combination_by_Confusion_Forest.html">217 acl-2011-Machine Translation System Combination by Confusion Forest</a></p>

Though this practice improves translation by weakening independence assumptions in the translation model, it nevertheless results in huge, redundant grammars, making both training and decoding inefficient. Here, we take the opposite approach, where we only use minimal rules (those that cannot be formed out of other rules), and instead rely on a rule Markov model of the derivation history to capture dependencies between minimal rules. Large-scale experiments on a state-of-the-art tree-to-string translation system show that our approach leads to a slimmer model, a faster decoder, yet the same translation quality (measured using B ) as composed rules.</p><p>5 0.85775924 <a title="30-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Issues_Concerning_Decoding_with_Synchronous_Context-free_Grammar.html">180 acl-2011-Issues Concerning Decoding with Synchronous Context-free Grammar</a></p>
<p>Author: Tagyoung Chung ; Licheng Fang ; Daniel Gildea</p><p>Abstract: We discuss some of the practical issues that arise from decoding with general synchronous context-free grammars. We examine problems caused by unary rules and we also examine how virtual nonterminals resulting from binarization can best be handled. We also investigate adding more flexibility to synchronous context-free grammars by adding glue rules and phrases.</p><p>6 0.85513079 <a title="30-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Hypothesis_Mixture_Decoding_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">155 acl-2011-Hypothesis Mixture Decoding for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

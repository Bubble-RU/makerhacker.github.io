<p>Author: Nina Dethlefs ; Heriberto Cuayahuitl</p><p>Abstract: Surface realisation decisions in language generation can be sensitive to a language model, but also to decisions of content selection. We therefore propose the joint optimisation of content selection and surface realisation using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). To this end, we suggest a novel reward function that is induced from human data and is especially suited for surface realisation. It is based on a generation space in the form of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Results in terms of task success and human-likeness suggest that our unified approach performs better than greedy or random baselines.</p><p>3 0.13902862 <a title="317-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Reversible_Stochastic_Attribute-Value_Grammars.html">267 acl-2011-Reversible Stochastic Attribute-Value Grammars</a></p>

<p>Author: Antske Fokkens</p><p>Abstract: When designing grammars of natural language, typically, more than one formal analysis can account for a given phenomenon. Moreover, because analyses interact, the choices made by the engineer influence the possibilities available in further grammar development. The order in which phenomena are treated may therefore have a major impact on the resulting grammar. This paper proposes to tackle this problem by using metagrammar development as a methodology for grammar engineering. Iargue that metagrammar engineering as an approach facilitates the systematic exploration of grammars through comparison of competing analyses. The idea is illustrated through a comparative study of auxiliary structures in HPSG-based grammars for German and Dutch. Auxiliaries form a central phenomenon of German and Dutch and are likely to influence many components of the grammar. This study shows that a special auxiliary+verb construction significantly improves efficiency compared to the standard argument-composition analysis for both parsing and generation.</p><p>5 0.11906516 <a title="317-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Exploring_Entity_Relations_for_Named_Entity_Disambiguation.html">128 acl-2011-Exploring Entity Relations for Named Entity Disambiguation</a></p>
<p>Author: Danuta Ploch</p><p>Abstract: Named entity disambiguation is the task of linking an entity mention in a text to the correct real-world referent predefined in a knowledge base, and is a crucial subtask in many areas like information retrieval or topic detection and tracking. Named entity disambiguation is challenging because entity mentions can be ambiguous and an entity can be referenced by different surface forms. We present an approach that exploits Wikipedia relations between entities co-occurring with the ambiguous form to derive a range of novel features for classifying candidate referents. We find that our features improve disambiguation results significantly over a strong popularity baseline, and are especially suitable for recognizing entities not contained in the knowledge base. Our system achieves state-of-the-art results on the TAC-KBP 2009 dataset.</p><p>6 0.098195523 <a title="317-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-I_Thou_Thee%2C_Thou_Traitor%3A_Predicting_Formal_vs._Informal_Address_in_English_Literature.html">157 acl-2011-I Thou Thee, Thou Traitor: Predicting Formal vs. Informal Address in English Literature</a></p>

<p>Author: Nathan Bodenstab ; Aaron Dunlop ; Keith Hall ; Brian Roark</p><p>Abstract: Efficient decoding for syntactic parsing has become a necessary research area as statistical grammars grow in accuracy and size and as more NLP applications leverage syntactic analyses. We review prior methods for pruning and then present a new framework that unifies their strengths into a single approach. Using a log linear model, we learn the optimal beam-search pruning parameters for each CYK chart cell, effectively predicting the most promising areas of the model space to explore. We demonstrate that our method is faster than coarse-to-fine pruning, exemplified in both the Charniak and Berkeley parsers, by empirically comparing our parser to the Berkeley parser using the same grammar and under identical operating conditions.</p><p>6 0.61340219 <a title="317-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Metagrammar_engineering%3A_Towards_systematic_exploration_of_implemented_grammars.html">219 acl-2011-Metagrammar engineering: Towards systematic exploration of implemented grammars</a></p>

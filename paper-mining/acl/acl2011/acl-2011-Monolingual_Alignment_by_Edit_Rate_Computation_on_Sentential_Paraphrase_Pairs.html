<p>Author: Donald Metzler ; Eduard Hovy ; Chunliang Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Paraphrase generation is an important task that has received a great deal of interest recently. Proposed data-driven solutions to the problem have ranged from simple approaches that make minimal use of NLP tools to more complex approaches that rely on numerous language-dependent resources. Despite all of the attention, there have been very few direct empirical evaluations comparing the merits of the different approaches. This paper empirically examines the tradeoffs between simple and sophisticated paraphrase harvesting approaches to help shed light on their strengths and weaknesses. Our evaluation reveals that very simple approaches fare surprisingly well and have a number of distinct advantages, including strong precision, good coverage, and low redundancy.</p><p>3 0.6369316 <a title="225-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Extracting_Paraphrases_from_Definition_Sentences_on_the_Web.html">132 acl-2011-Extracting Paraphrases from Definition Sentences on the Web</a></p>

We propose an automatic method of extracting paraphrases from definition sentences, which are also automatically acquired from the Web. We observe that a huge number of concepts are defined in Web documents, and that the sentences that define the same concept tend to convey mostly the same information using different expressions and thus contain many paraphrases. We show that a large number of paraphrases can be automatically extracted with high precision by regarding the sentences that define the same concept as parallel corpora.

<p>Author: David Chen ; William Dolan</p><p>Abstract: A lack of standard datasets and evaluation metrics has prevented the field of paraphrasing from making the kind of rapid progress enjoyed by the machine translation community over the last 15 years. We address both problems by presenting a novel data collection framework that produces highly parallel text data relatively inexpensively and on a large scale. The highly parallel nature of this data allows us to use simple n-gram comparisons to measure both the semantic adequacy and lexical dissimilarity of paraphrase candidates. In addition to being simple and efficient to compute, experiments show that these metrics correlate highly with human judgments.</p><p>5 0.39316013 <a title="225-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Using_Bilingual_Parallel_Corpora_for_Cross-Lingual_Textual_Entailment.html">327 acl-2011-Using Bilingual Parallel Corpora for Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment</a></p>
<p>Author: Yashar Mehdad ; Matteo Negri ; Marcello Federico</p><p>Abstract: This paper explores the use of bilingual parallel corpora as a source of lexical knowledge for cross-lingual textual entailment. We claim that, in spite of the inherent difficulties of the task, phrase tables extracted from parallel data allow to capture both lexical relations between single words, and contextual information useful for inference. We experiment with a phrasal matching method in order to: i) build a system portable across languages, and ii) evaluate the contribution of lexical knowledge in isolation, without interaction with other inference mechanisms. Results achieved on an English-Spanish corpus obtained from the RTE3 dataset support our claim, with an overall accuracy above average scores reported by RTE participants on monolingual data. Finally, we show that using parallel corpora to extract paraphrase tables reveals their potential also in the monolingual setting, improving the results achieved with other sources of lexical knowledge.</p><p>6 0.34672344 <a title="225-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Translating_from_Morphologically_Complex_Languages%3A_A_Paraphrase-Based_Approach.html">310 acl-2011-Translating from Morphologically Complex Languages: A Paraphrase-Based Approach</a></p>

<p>Author: Preslav Nakov ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach to translating from a morphologically complex language. Unlike previous research, which has targeted word inflections and concatenations, we focus on the pairwise relationship between morphologically related words, which we treat as potential paraphrases and handle using paraphrasing techniques at the word, phrase, and sentence level. An important advantage of this framework is that it can cope with derivational morphology, which has so far remained largely beyond the capabilities of statistical machine translation systems. Our experiments translating from Malay, whose morphology is mostly derivational, into English show signif- icant improvements over rivaling approaches based on five automatic evaluation measures (for 320,000 sentence pairs; 9.5 million English word tokens).</p><p>6 0.65123743 <a title="225-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Using_Bilingual_Parallel_Corpora_for_Cross-Lingual_Textual_Entailment.html">327 acl-2011-Using Bilingual Parallel Corpora for Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment</a></p>

<p>Author: Wei-Bin Liang ; Chung-Hsien Wu ; Chia-Ping Chen</p><p>Abstract: In this study, a novel approach to robust dialogue act detection for error-prone speech recognition in a spoken dialogue system is proposed. First, partial sentence trees are proposed to represent a speech recognition output sentence. Semantic information and the derivation rules of the partial sentence trees are extracted and used to model the relationship between the dialogue acts and the derivation rules. The constructed model is then used to generate a semantic score for dialogue act detection given an input speech utterance. The proposed approach is implemented and evaluated in a Mandarin spoken dialogue system for tour-guiding service. Combined with scores derived from the ASR recognition probability and the dialogue history, the proposed approach achieves 84.3% detection accuracy, an absolute improvement of 34.7% over the baseline of the semantic slot-based method with 49.6% detection accuracy.</p><p>2 0.76739049 <a title="225-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-C-Feel-It%3A_A_Sentiment_Analyzer_for_Micro-blogs.html">64 acl-2011-C-Feel-It: A Sentiment Analyzer for Micro-blogs</a></p>

<p>Author: Shane Bergsma ; David Yarowsky ; Kenneth Church</p><p>Abstract: Resolving coordination ambiguity is a classic hard problem. This paper looks at coordination disambiguation in complex noun phrases (NPs). Parsers trained on the Penn Treebank are reporting impressive numbers these days, but they don’t do very well on this problem (79%). We explore systems trained using three types of corpora: (1) annotated (e.g. the Penn Treebank), (2) bitexts (e.g. Europarl), and (3) unannotated monolingual (e.g. Google N-grams). Size matters: (1) is a million words, (2) is potentially billions of words and (3) is potentially trillions of words. The unannotated monolingual data is helpful when the ambiguity can be resolved through associations among the lexical items. The bilingual data is helpful when the ambiguity can be resolved by the order of words in the translation. We train separate classifiers with monolingual and bilingual features and iteratively improve them via achieves data and pervised tations. co-training. The co-trained classifier close to 96% accuracy on Treebank makes 20% fewer errors than a susystem trained with Treebank anno-</p><p>5 0.63336831 <a title="225-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Towards_Tracking_Semantic_Change_by_Visual_Analytics.html">307 acl-2011-Towards Tracking Semantic Change by Visual Analytics</a></p>

Keim ; Frans Plank</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to detecting and tracking changes in word meaning by visually modeling and representing diachronic development in word contexts. Previous studies have shown that computational models are capable of clustering and disambiguating senses, a more recent trend investigates whether changes in word meaning can be tracked by automatic methods. The aim of our study is to offer a new instrument for investigating the diachronic development of word senses in a way that allows for a better understanding of the nature of semantic change in general. For this purpose we combine techniques from the field of Visual Analytics with unsupervised methods from Natural Language Processing, allowing for an interactive visual exploration of semantic change.</p><p>6 0.62662405 <a title="225-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Joint_Bilingual_Sentiment_Classification_with_Unlabeled_Parallel_Corpora.html">183 acl-2011-Joint Bilingual Sentiment Classification with Unlabeled Parallel Corpora</a></p>

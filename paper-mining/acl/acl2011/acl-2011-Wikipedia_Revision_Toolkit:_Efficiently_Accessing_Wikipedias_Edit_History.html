<p>Author: William Coster ; David Kauchak</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we examine the task of sentence simplification which aims to reduce the reading complexity of a sentence by incorporating more accessible vocabulary and sentence structure. We introduce a new data set that pairs English Wikipedia with Simple English Wikipedia and is orders of magnitude larger than any previously examined for sentence simplification. The data contains the full range of simplification operations including rewording, reordering, insertion and deletion. We provide an analysis of this corpus as well as preliminary results using a phrase-based trans- lation approach for simplification.</p><p>3 0.20674957 <a title="337-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Language_of_Vandalism%3A_Improving_Wikipedia_Vandalism_Detection_via_Stylometric_Analysis.html">195 acl-2011-Language of Vandalism: Improving Wikipedia Vandalism Detection via Stylometric Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Manoj Harpalani ; Michael Hart ; Sandesh Signh ; Rob Johnson ; Yejin Choi</p><p>Abstract: Community-based knowledge forums, such as Wikipedia, are susceptible to vandalism, i.e., ill-intentioned contributions that are detrimental to the quality of collective intelligence. Most previous work to date relies on shallow lexico-syntactic patterns and metadata to automatically detect vandalism in Wikipedia. In this paper, we explore more linguistically motivated approaches to vandalism detection. In particular, we hypothesize that textual vandalism constitutes a unique genre where a group of people share a similar linguistic behavior. Experimental results suggest that (1) statistical models give evidence to unique language styles in vandalism, and that (2) deep syntactic patterns based on probabilistic context free grammars (PCFG) discriminate vandalism more effectively than shallow lexicosyntactic patterns based on n-grams. ,</p><p>4 0.17184223 <a title="337-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Local_and_Global_Algorithms_for_Disambiguation_to_Wikipedia.html">213 acl-2011-Local and Global Algorithms for Disambiguation to Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>Author: Lev Ratinov ; Dan Roth ; Doug Downey ; Mike Anderson</p><p>Abstract: Disambiguating concepts and entities in a context sensitive way is a fundamental problem in natural language processing. The comprehensiveness of Wikipedia has made the online encyclopedia an increasingly popular target for disambiguation. Disambiguation to Wikipedia is similar to a traditional Word Sense Disambiguation task, but distinct in that the Wikipedia link structure provides additional information about which disambiguations are compatible. In this work we analyze approaches that utilize this information to arrive at coherent sets of disambiguations for a given document (which we call “global” approaches), and compare them to more traditional (local) approaches. We show that previous approaches for global disambiguation can be improved, but even then the local disambiguation provides a baseline which is very hard to beat.</p><p>5 0.16113582 <a title="337-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Exploring_Entity_Relations_for_Named_Entity_Disambiguation.html">128 acl-2011-Exploring Entity Relations for Named Entity Disambiguation</a></p>
<p>Author: Danuta Ploch</p><p>Abstract: Named entity disambiguation is the task of linking an entity mention in a text to the correct real-world referent predefined in a knowledge base, and is a crucial subtask in many areas like information retrieval or topic detection and tracking. Named entity disambiguation is challenging because entity mentions can be ambiguous and an entity can be referenced by different surface forms. We present an approach that exploits Wikipedia relations between entities co-occurring with the ambiguous form to derive a range of novel features for classifying candidate referents. We find that our features improve disambiguation results significantly over a strong popularity baseline, and are especially suitable for recognizing entities not contained in the knowledge base. Our system achieves state-of-the-art results on the TAC-KBP 2009 dataset.</p><p>6 0.15350154 <a title="337-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-End-to-End_Relation_Extraction_Using_Distant_Supervision_from_External_Semantic_Repositories.html">114 acl-2011-End-to-End Relation Extraction Using Distant Supervision from External Semantic Repositories</a></p>

<p>Author: Or Biran ; Samuel Brody ; Noemie Elhadad</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for lexical simplification. Simplification rules are learned from a comparable corpus, and the rules are applied in a context-aware fashion to input sentences. Our method is unsupervised. Furthermore, it does not require any alignment or correspondence among the complex and simple corpora. We evaluate the simplification according to three criteria: preservation of grammaticality, preservation of meaning, and degree of simplification. Results show that our method outperforms an established simplification baseline for both meaning preservation and simplification, while maintaining a high level of grammaticality.</p><p>5 0.62592608 <a title="337-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Wikulu%3A_An_Extensible_Architecture_for_Integrating_Natural_Language_Processing_Techniques_with_Wikis.html">338 acl-2011-Wikulu: An Extensible Architecture for Integrating Natural Language Processing Techniques with Wikis</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Bar ; Nicolai Erbs ; Torsten Zesch ; Iryna Gurevych</p><p>Abstract: We present Wikulu1, a system focusing on supporting wiki users with their everyday tasks by means of an intelligent interface. Wikulu is implemented as an extensible architecture which transparently integrates natural language processing (NLP) techniques with wikis. It is designed to be deployed with any wiki platform, and the current prototype integrates a wide range of NLP algorithms such as keyphrase extraction, link discovery, text segmentation, summarization, or text similarity. Additionally, we show how Wikulu can be applied for visually analyzing the results of NLP algorithms, educational purposes, and enabling semantic wikis.</p><p>6 0.60571325 <a title="337-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Simple_English_Wikipedia%3A_A_New_Text_Simplification_Task.html">283 acl-2011-Simple English Wikipedia: A New Text Simplification Task</a></p>

<p>Author: Hiroyuki Shindo ; Akinori Fujino ; Masaaki Nagata</p><p>Abstract: We propose a model that incorporates an insertion operator in Bayesian tree substitution grammars (BTSG). Tree insertion is helpful for modeling syntax patterns accurately with fewer grammar rules than BTSG. The experimental parsing results show that our model outperforms a standard PCFG and BTSG for a small dataset. For a large dataset, our model obtains comparable results to BTSG, making the number of grammar rules much smaller than with BTSG.</p><p>4 0.60430413 <a title="337-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Generalized_Interpolation_in_Decision_Tree_LM.html">142 acl-2011-Generalized Interpolation in Decision Tree LM</a></p>
<p>Author: Denis Filimonov ; Mary Harper</p><p>Abstract: In the face of sparsity, statistical models are often interpolated with lower order (backoff) models, particularly in Language Modeling. In this paper, we argue that there is a relation between the higher order and the backoff model that must be satisfied in order for the interpolation to be effective. We show that in n-gram models, the relation is trivially held, but in models that allow arbitrary clustering of context (such as decision tree models), this relation is generally not satisfied. Based on this insight, we also propose a generalization of linear interpolation which significantly improves the performance of a decision tree language model.</p><p>5 0.54826128 <a title="337-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Computing_and_Evaluating_Syntactic_Complexity_Features_for_Automated_Scoring_of_Spontaneous_Non-Native_Speech.html">77 acl-2011-Computing and Evaluating Syntactic Complexity Features for Automated Scoring of Spontaneous Non-Native Speech</a></p>

Our goal is to find effective features, selected from a large set of features proposed previously and some new features designed in analogous ways from a syntactic complexity perspective that correlate well with human ratings of the same spoken responses, and to build automatic scoring models based on the most promising features by using machine learning methods. On human transcriptions with manually annotated clause and sentence boundaries, our best scoring model achieves an overall Pearson correlation with human rater scores of r=0.49 on an unseen test set, whereas correlations of models using sentence or clause boundaries from automated classifiers are around r=0.2. 1</p><p>6 0.52838635 <a title="337-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Reordering_with_Source_Language_Collocations.html">266 acl-2011-Reordering with Source Language Collocations</a></p>

<p>Author: Lei Zhang ; Bing Liu</p><p>Abstract: Identifying domain-dependent opinion words is a key problem in opinion mining and has been studied by several researchers. However, existing work has been focused on adjectives and to some extent verbs. Limited work has been done on nouns and noun phrases. In our work, we used the feature-based opinion mining model, and we found that in some domains nouns and noun phrases that indicate product features may also imply opinions. In many such cases, these nouns are not subjective but objective. Their involved sentences are also objective sentences and imply positive or negative opinions. Identifying such nouns and noun phrases and their polarities is very challenging but critical for effective opinion mining in these domains. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been studied in the literature. This paper proposes a method to deal with the problem. Experimental results based on real-life datasets show promising results. 1</p><p>3 0.26183596 <a title="211-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Extracting_Opinion_Expressions_and_Their_Polarities_-_Exploration_of_Pipelines_and_Joint_Models.html">131 acl-2011-Extracting Opinion Expressions and Their Polarities - Exploration of Pipelines and Joint Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Johansson ; Alessandro Moschitti</p><p>Abstract: We investigate systems that identify opinion expressions and assigns polarities to the extracted expressions. In particular, we demonstrate the benefit of integrating opinion extraction and polarity classification into a joint model using features reflecting the global polarity structure. The model is trained using large-margin structured prediction methods. The system is evaluated on the MPQA opinion corpus, where we compare it to the only previously published end-to-end system for opinion expression extraction and polarity classification. The results show an improvement of between 10 and 15 absolute points in F-measure.</p><p>4 0.24144733 <a title="211-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Aspect_Ranking%3A_Identifying_Important_Product_Aspects_from_Online_Consumer_Reviews.html">45 acl-2011-Aspect Ranking: Identifying Important Product Aspects from Online Consumer Reviews</a></p>
<p>Author: Jianxing Yu ; Zheng-Jun Zha ; Meng Wang ; Tat-Seng Chua</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we dedicate to the topic of aspect ranking, which aims to automatically identify important product aspects from online consumer reviews. The important aspects are identified according to two observations: (a) the important aspects of a product are usually commented by a large number of consumers; and (b) consumers’ opinions on the important aspects greatly influence their overall opinions on the product. In particular, given consumer reviews of a product, we first identify the product aspects by a shallow dependency parser and determine consumers’ opinions on these aspects via a sentiment classifier. We then develop an aspect ranking algorithm to identify the important aspects by simultaneously considering the aspect frequency and the influence of consumers’ opinions given to each aspect on their overall opinions. The experimental results on 11 popular products in four domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We further apply the aspect ranking results to the application ofdocumentlevel sentiment classification, and improve the performance significantly.</p><p>5 0.22557594 <a title="211-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-A_Pilot_Study_of_Opinion_Summarization_in_Conversations.html">21 acl-2011-A Pilot Study of Opinion Summarization in Conversations</a></p>
<p>Author: Dong Wang ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a pilot study of opinion summarization on conversations. We create a corpus containing extractive and abstractive summaries of speaker’s opinion towards a given topic using 88 telephone conversations. We adopt two methods to perform extractive summarization. The first one is a sentence-ranking method that linearly combines scores measured from different aspects including topic relevance, subjectivity, and sentence importance. The second one is a graph-based method, which incorporates topic and sentiment information, as well as additional information about sentence-to-sentence relations extracted based on dialogue structure. Our evaluation results show that both methods significantly outperform the baseline approach that extracts the longest utterances. In particular, we find that incorporating dialogue structure in the graph-based method contributes to the improved system performance.</p><p>6 0.17777753 <a title="211-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Sentiment_Analysis_of_Citations_using_Sentence_Structure-Based_Features.html">281 acl-2011-Sentiment Analysis of Citations using Sentence Structure-Based Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Myle Ott ; Yejin Choi ; Claire Cardie ; Jeffrey T. Hancock</p><p>Abstract: Consumers increasingly rate, review and research products online (Jansen, 2010; Litvin et al., 2008). Consequently, websites containing consumer reviews are becoming targets of opinion spam. While recent work has focused primarily on manually identifiable instances of opinion spam, in this work we study deceptive opinion spam—fictitious opinions that have been deliberately written to sound authentic. Integrating work from psychology and computational linguistics, we develop and compare three approaches to detecting deceptive opinion spam, and ultimately develop a classifier that is nearly 90% accurate on our gold-standard opinion spam dataset. Based on feature analysis of our learned models, we additionally make several theoretical contributions, including revealing a relationship between deceptive opinions and imaginative writing.</p><p>6 0.59824008 <a title="211-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-A_Pilot_Study_of_Opinion_Summarization_in_Conversations.html">21 acl-2011-A Pilot Study of Opinion Summarization in Conversations</a></p>

<p>Author: Aaron Michelony</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of predicting which words a student will click in a vocabulary learning system. Often a language learner will find value in the ability to look up the meaning of an unknown word while reading an electronic document by clicking the word. Highlighting words likely to be unknown to a readeris attractive due to drawing his orher attention to it and indicating that information is available. However, this option is usually done manually in vocabulary systems and online encyclopedias such as Wikipedia. Furthurmore, it is never on a per-user basis. This paper presents an automated way of highlighting words likely to be unknown to the specific user. We present related work in search engine ranking, a description of the study used to collect click data, the experiment we performed using the random forest machine learning algorithm and finish with a discussion of future work.</p><p>3 0.47796455 <a title="211-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Language-Independent_Parsing_with_Empty_Elements.html">192 acl-2011-Language-Independent Parsing with Empty Elements</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuening Hu ; Jordan Boyd-Graber ; Brianna Satinoff</p><p>Abstract: Topic models have been used extensively as a tool for corpus exploration, and a cottage industry has developed to tweak topic models to better encode human intuitions or to better model data. However, creating such extensions requires expertise in machine learning unavailable to potential end-users of topic modeling software. In this work, we develop a framework for allowing users to iteratively refine the topics discovered by models such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) by adding constraints that enforce that sets of words must appear together in the same topic. We incorporate these constraints interactively by selectively removing elements in the state of a Markov Chain used for inference; we investigate a variety of methods for incorporating this information and demonstrate that these interactively added constraints improve topic usefulness for simulated and actual user sessions.</p><p>5 0.43629193 <a title="211-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Better_Automatic_Treebank_Conversion_Using_A_Feature-Based_Approach.html">59 acl-2011-Better Automatic Treebank Conversion Using A Feature-Based Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Muhua Zhu ; Jingbo Zhu ; Minghan Hu</p><p>Abstract: For the task of automatic treebank conversion, this paper presents a feature-based approach which encodes bracketing structures in a treebank into features to guide the conversion of this treebank to a different standard. Experiments on two Chinese treebanks show that our approach improves conversion accuracy by 1.31% over a strong baseline.</p><p>6 0.35266817 <a title="211-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Social_Network_Extraction_from_Texts%3A_A_Thesis_Proposal.html">286 acl-2011-Social Network Extraction from Texts: A Thesis Proposal</a></p>

</p><p>5 It is the first time functional morphological features are used for Arabic NLP. [sent-10, score-0.437]
</p><p>6 One aspect of syntax, which is often not explicitly modeled in parsing, involves morphological constraints on syntactic structure, such as agreement, which often plays an important role in morphologically rich languages. [sent-13, score-0.255]
</p><p>7 In this paper, we explore the role of morphological features in parsing Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). [sent-14, score-0.309]
</p><p>8 For MSA, the space of possible morphological features is fairly large. [sent-15, score-0.237]
</p><p>9 We also explore going beyond the easily detectable, regular form-based (“surface”) features, by representing functional values for some morphological features. [sent-17, score-0.364]

</p><p>14 As expected, the lack of diacritics contributes heavily to Arabic’s morphological ambiguity. [sent-98, score-0.195]
</p><p>15 In this work, we only use undiacritized text; however, some of our parsing features which are derived through morphological disambiguation include diacritics (specifically, lemmas, see below). [sent-99, score-0.427]
</p><p>16 1 Lexeme and features Alternatively, Arabic words can be described in terms of lexemes and inflectional features. [sent-111, score-0.336]
</p><p>17 A lemma is a specific word form chosen to represent the lexeme word set; for example,  Arabic verb lemmas are third person masculine singular perfective. [sent-113, score-0.341]
</p><p>18 We explore using both the diacritized lemma and the undiacritized lemma (hereafter LMM). [sent-114, score-0.299]
</p><p>19 Just as the lemma abstracts over inflectional morphology, the root abstracts over both inflectional and derivational morphology and thus provides a deeper level of lexical abstraction, indicating the “core” meaning of the word. [sent-115, score-0.739]
</p><p>20 2 The rationality feature interacts with syntactic agreement and other inflectional features (discussed next); as such, we group it with those features in this paper’s experiments. [sent-124, score-0.693]
</p><p>21 The inflectional features define the the space of variations of the word forms associated with a lexeme. [sent-125, score-0.336]
</p><p>22 Some inflectional features affect more than one morpheme in the same word. [sent-128, score-0.368]
</p><p>23 functional features Additionally, some inflectional features, specifically gender and number, are expressed using different morphemes in different words (even within the same part-ofspeech). [sent-152, score-0.746]
</p><p>24 Plurality can be expressed using sound plural suf-  +~  fixes or using a pattern change together with singular suffixes. [sent-159, score-0.199]
</p><p>25 madAris+φ ‘schools’, which is feminine and plural inflectionally, but has a masculine singular suffix. [sent-173, score-0.31]
</p><p>26 A similar inconsistency appears in feminine nouns that are not inflected using sound gender suffixes, e. [sent-175, score-0.311]
</p><p>27 , the feminine form of the masculine singular adjective  ? [sent-177, score-0.23]
</p><p>28 To address this inconsistency in the correspondence between inflectional features and morphemes, and inspired by (Smrž, 2007), we distinguish between two types of inflectional features: surface (or form-based)4 features and functional features. [sent-188, score-0.934]
</p><p>29 Most available Arabic NLP tools and resources model morphology using surface inflectional features and do not mark rationality; this includes the  PATB (Maamouri et al. [sent-189, score-0.461]
</p><p>30 , 2004), the Buckwalter morphological analyzer (BAMA) (Buckwalter, 2004) and tools using them such as the Morphological Analysis and Disambiguation for Arabic (MADA) system (Habash and Rambow, 2005). [sent-190, score-0.164]
</p><p>31 The ElixirFM analyzer (Smrž, 2007) readily provides the functional inflectional number feature, but not full functional gender (only for adjectives and verbs but not for nouns), nor rationality. [sent-191, score-0.858]
</p><p>32 Most recently, Alkuhlani and Habash (201 1) present a version of the PATB (part 3) that is annotated for functional gender, num3We ignore duals, which are regular in Arabic, and case/state variations in this discussion for simplicity. [sent-192, score-0.2]
</p><p>33 Morpho-syntactic interactions Inflectional features and rationality interact with syntax in two ways. [sent-197, score-0.247]
</p><p>34 There are three very common cases of exceptional agreement: verbs preceding subjects are always singular, adjectives of irrational plural nouns are always feminine singular, and verbs whose subjects are irrational plural are also always feminine singul? [sent-202, score-0.58]
</p><p>35 ¸@ AlðkyAt ‘smart’ , of the feminine plural (and rational) H? [sent-207, score-0.198]
</p><p>36 These agreement rules always refer to functional morphology categories; they are orthogonal to the morpheme-feature inconsistency discussed above. [sent-218, score-0.323]
</p><p>37 The DET feature plays an important role in distinguishing between the N-N idafa (possessive) construction, in which only the last noun may bear the definite article, and the N-A modifier construction,  in which both elements generally exhibit agreement in definiteness. [sent-224, score-0.318]
</p><p>38 Lexical features do not constrain syntactic structure as inflectional features do. [sent-225, score-0.409]
</p><p>39 The core POS tagsets Words also have associated part-of-speech (POS) tags, e. [sent-228, score-0.164]
</p><p>40 In comparison, the tagset of the Buckwalter Morphological Analyzer (Buckwalter, 2004) used in the PATB has a core POS set of 44 tags (before morphological extension). [sent-232, score-0.478]
</p><p>41 The CATIB6 tagset can be viewed as a further reduction, with the exception that CATIB6  contains a passive voice tag; however, this tag constitutes only 0. [sent-235, score-0.262]
</p><p>42 Extended POS tagsets The notion of “POS tagset” in natural language processing usually does not refer to a core set. [sent-237, score-0.164]
</p><p>43 Instead, the Penn English Treebank (PTB) uses a set of 46 tags, including not only the core POS, but also the complete set of morphological features (this tagset is still fairly small since English is morphologically impoverished). [sent-238, score-0.578]
</p><p>44 These tagsets are hybrids in the sense that they are neither simply the core POS, nor the complete morphologically enriched tagset, but instead they selectively enrich the core POS tagset with only certain morphological features. [sent-241, score-0.669]
</p><p>45 A full dicussion of how these tagsets affect parsing is presented in Marton et al. [sent-242, score-0.175]
</p><p>46 +wn; this tagset is the best-performing tagset for Arabic on predicted values. [sent-247, score-0.508]
</p><p>47 (c) the PATB full tagset (BW), size ≈2000+ (Buckwalter, 2004); We only discuss here t≈he2 b0e0s+t performing tagsets (on predicted values), and BW for comparison. [sent-248, score-0.389]

</p><p>49 (1999) report that an optimal tagset for parsing Czech consists of a basic POS tag plus a CASE feature (when applicable). [sent-251, score-0.344]
</p><p>50 This tagset (size 58) outperforms the basic Czech POS tagset (size 13) and the complete tagset (size ≈3000+). [sent-252, score-0.666]
</p><p>51 th Se use of a subset of Spanish morphological features (number for adjectives, determiners, nouns, pronouns, and verbs; and mode for verbs) outperforms other combinations. [sent-261, score-0.237]
</p><p>52 Our approach is comparable to their work in terms of its systematic exploration of the space of morphological features. [sent-262, score-0.164]
</p><p>53 However, we go beyond previous work in that we also extend this morphologically enhanced feature set to include additional lexical and inflectional features. [sent-272, score-0.371]
</p><p>54 Previous work with MaltParser in Russian, Turkish and Hindi showed gains with case but not with agreement features (Nivre et al. [sent-273, score-0.133]
</p><p>55 , 2010), and the first to use functional features for this task (this paper). [sent-277, score-0.273]
</p><p>56 1), we examine a large space of settings in the following order: the contribution of numerous inflectional features in a controlled fashion (Section 5. [sent-282, score-0.399]
</p><p>57 2);5 the contribution of the lexical features in a similar fashion, as well as the combination of lexical and inflectional features (Section 5. [sent-283, score-0.439]

</p><p>59 21  Table 1: CORE1 2 with inflectional features, predicted input. [sent-380, score-0.327]
</p><p>60 different setups, we added nine morphological features with values predicted by MADA: DET (presence of the definite determiner), PERSON, ASPECT, VOICE, MOOD, GENDER, NUMBER, STATE (morphological marking as head of an idafa construction), and CASE. [sent-384, score-0.547]
</p><p>61 , 2010); when all features are provided as gold input, All actually does better than individual features, which puts to rest a concern that its decrease here 1591 feature DET PERSON ASPECT VOICE MOOD  acc  set size  99. [sent-391, score-0.123]
</p><p>62 Here, when features are predicted, the DET feature (determiner), followed by the STATE (construct state, idafa) feature, are top individual contributors in setup Sep. [sent-438, score-0.157]
</p><p>63 3  Lexical features  Next, we experimented with adding the lexical features, which involve semantic abstraction to some degree: LEMMA, LMM (the undiacritized lemma), and ROOT. [sent-442, score-0.223]
</p><p>64 All lexical features are predicted with high accuracy (bottom of Table 2). [sent-478, score-0.137]
</p><p>65 Following the same greedy heuristic, we augmented the best inflection-based model CORE1 2+DET+PNG with lexical features, and found that only the undiacritized lemma (LMM) alone improved performance (80. [sent-479, score-0.226]
</p><p>66 4 Inflectional feature engineering So far we experimented with morphological ture values as predicted by MADA. [sent-483, score-0.312]
</p><p>67 Therefore, we next experimented with modifying inflectional features that proved most useful. [sent-485, score-0.37]
</p><p>68 As DET may help distinguish the N-N idafa construction from the N-A modifier construction, we attempted modeling also the DET values of previous and next elements (as MaltParser’s stk[1] + buf[1], in addition to stk[0] + buf[0]). [sent-486, score-0.169]
</p><p>69 5  Functional feature values  The NUMBER and GENDER features we have used  so far only reflect surface (as opposed to functional) values, e. [sent-550, score-0.185]
</p><p>70 Predicting functional features To predict functional GENDER, functional NUMBER and RATIONALITY, we build a simple maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) model using these annotations in the corpus created by Alkuhlani and Habash (201 1). [sent-554, score-0.673]
</p><p>71 For gender and number, we further back off to the surface values; for rationality, we back off to the most common value (irrational). [sent-557, score-0.227]
</p><p>72 On our predicted dev set, the overall accuracy baseline of predicting correct functional gender-number-rationality using surface features is 85. [sent-558, score-0.399]
</p><p>73 The second part repeats previous experiments with surface morphological features. [sent-583, score-0.226]
</p><p>74 The third part uses the new functional morphological features instead. [sent-584, score-0.437]
</p><p>75 22%, respectively, as we replace surface features with functional features. [sent-587, score-0.335]
</p><p>76 The combination of all three functional features (NUMBER, GENDER, RATIONALITY) provides for a nice cumulative effect. [sent-591, score-0.273]
</p><p>77 In the fourth part of the table, we include the other features which we found previously to be helpful, 10We didn’t mark the number-words since in our training data there were less than 30 lemmas ofless than 2000 such tokens, so presumably their agreement patterns can be more easily learned. [sent-593, score-0.133]
</p><p>78 3% absolute (35% relative) is due to the use of functional features. [sent-601, score-0.2]
</p><p>79 The last row in the fourth part of Table 6 shows that using both surface and functional variants of NUMBER and GENDER does not help (hurts, in fact); the functional morphology features carry sufficient information for syntactic disambiguation. [sent-607, score-0.598]
</p><p>80 The last part of the table revalidates the gains achieved of the best feature combination using the two other POS tagsets mentioned in Section 3: CATIBEX (the best performing tagset with predicted values), and BW (the best POS tagset with gold values in Marton et al. [sent-608, score-0.661]
</p><p>81 The result using BW reconfirms that BW is not the best tagset to use for parsing Arabic with current prediction ability. [sent-612, score-0.294]
</p><p>82 –  6  Error Analysis  We analyze the attachment accuracy by attachment type. [sent-623, score-0.132]
</p><p>83 We then add features designed to improve idafa and those relations subject to agreement, subject and nominal modification (DET2, PERSON, NUMBER, GENDER). [sent-634, score-0.413]
</p><p>84 We see that as expected, subject, nominal modification (MN), and idafa reduce error by substantial margins (error reduction over CORE12+LMM greater than 8%, in the case of idafa the error reduction is 16. [sent-635, score-0.401]
</p><p>85 We assume that the relations not subject to agreement (object and prepositional attachment) improve  because of the overall improvement in the parse due to the improvements in the other relations. [sent-638, score-0.156]
</p><p>86 When we move to the functional features, we again see a reduction in the attachments which are subject to agreement, namely subject and nominal modification (error reductions over surface features of 2. [sent-639, score-0.478]
</p><p>87 Idafa decreases slightly (since this relation is not affected by the functional features), while object stays the same. [sent-642, score-0.2]
</p><p>88 Again, we can only explain this by proposing that the improvement in nominal modification attachment has the indirect effect of ruling out some bad prepositional attachments as well. [sent-645, score-0.157]
</p><p>89 In summary, we see that not only do morphological features and functional morphology features in particular improve parsing, but they improve parsing in the way that we expect: those relations subject to agreement improve more than those that are not. [sent-646, score-0.773]
</p><p>90 , it has not learned that certain syntactic relations  require identical (functional) morphological feature values. [sent-649, score-0.242]
</p><p>91 The gains in parsing quality reflect that the MaltParser SVM classifier has learned that the pairing of specific morphological feature values e. [sent-650, score-0.286]
</p><p>92 –  –  7  Conclusions and Future Work  We explored the contribution of different morphological (inflectional and lexical) features to dependency parsing of Arabic. [sent-655, score-0.386]
</p><p>93 We find that definiteness (DET), φ-features (PERSON, NUMBER, GENDER), and undiacritized lemma (LMM) are most helpful for Arabic dependency parsing on predicted input. [sent-656, score-0.407]
</p><p>94 We further find that functional morphology features and rationality improve over surface morphological features, as predicted by the complex agreement rules of Arabic. [sent-657, score-0.86]
</p><p>95 To our knowledge, this is the first result in Arabic NLP that uses functional morphology features, and that shows an improvement over surface features. [sent-658, score-0.325]
</p><p>96 In future work, we intend to improve the predic-  tion of functional morphological features in order to improve parsing accuracy. [sent-659, score-0.509]
</p><p>97 We also intend to investigate how these features can be integrated into other parsing frameworks; we expect them to help independently of the framework. [sent-660, score-0.145]

<p>Author: Muhammad Abdul-Mageed ; Mona Diab ; Mohammed Korayem</p><p>Abstract: Although Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis (SSA) has been witnessing a flurry of novel research, there are few attempts to build SSA systems for Morphologically-Rich Languages (MRL). In the current study, we report efforts to partially fill this gap. We present a newly developed manually annotated corpus ofModern Standard Arabic (MSA) together with a new polarity lexicon.The corpus is a collection of newswire documents annotated on the sentence level. We also describe an automatic SSA tagging system that exploits the annotated data. We investigate the impact of different levels ofpreprocessing settings on the SSA classification task. We show that by explicitly accounting for the rich morphology the system is able to achieve significantly higher levels of performance.</p><p>5 0.18106592 <a title="164-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-A_Discriminative_Model_for_Joint_Morphological_Disambiguation_and_Dependency_Parsing.html">10 acl-2011-A Discriminative Model for Joint Morphological Disambiguation and Dependency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: John Lee ; Jason Naradowsky ; David A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: Most previous studies of morphological disambiguation and dependency parsing have been pursued independently. Morphological taggers operate on n-grams and do not take into account syntactic relations; parsers use the “pipeline” approach, assuming that morphological information has been separately obtained. However, in morphologically-rich languages, there is often considerable interaction between morphology and syntax, such that neither can be disambiguated without the other. In this paper, we propose a discriminative model that jointly infers morphological properties and syntactic structures. In evaluations on various highly-inflected languages, this joint model outperforms both a baseline tagger in morphological disambiguation, and a pipeline parser in head selection.</p><p>6 0.15459047 <a title="164-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-The_Arabic_Online_Commentary_Dataset%3A_an_Annotated_Dataset_of_Informal_Arabic_with_High_Dialectal_Content.html">299 acl-2011-The Arabic Online Commentary Dataset: an Annotated Dataset of Informal Arabic with High Dialectal Content</a></p>

<p>Author: Nizar Habash ; Ryan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Arabic handwriting recognition (HR) is a challenging problem due to Arabic’s connected letter forms, consonantal diacritics and rich morphology. In this paper we isolate the task of identification of erroneous words in HR from the task of producing corrections for these words. We consider a variety of linguistic (morphological and syntactic) and non-linguistic features to automatically identify these errors.

<p>Author: Omar F. Zaidan ; Chris Callison-Burch</p><p>Abstract: The written form of Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), differs quite a bit from the spoken dialects of Arabic, which are the true “native” languages of Arabic speakers used in daily life. However, due to MSA’s prevalence in written form, almost all Arabic datasets have predominantly MSA content. We present the Arabic Online Commentary Dataset, a 52M-word monolingual dataset rich in dialectal content, and we describe our long-term annotation effort to identify the dialect level (and dialect itself) in each sentence of the dataset. So far, we have labeled 108K sentences, 41% of which as having dialectal content. We also present experimental results on the task of automatic dialect identification, using the collected labels for training and evaluation.</p><p>5 0.68397635 <a title="164-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Automatic_Headline_Generation_using_Character_Cross-Correlation.html">51 acl-2011-Automatic Headline Generation using Character Cross-Correlation</a></p>

Affixes and clitics are regularly attached to stems which make direct comparison between words not practical. In this paper we propose a new automatic headline generation technique that utilizes character cross-correlation to extract best headlines and to overcome the Arabic language complex morphology. The system that uses character cross-correlation achieves ROUGE-L score of 0. 19384 while the exact word matching scores only 0. 17252 for the same set of documents. 1</p><p>6 0.66446358 <a title="164-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Subjectivity_and_Sentiment_Analysis_of_Modern_Standard_Arabic.html">289 acl-2011-Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis of Modern Standard Arabic</a></p>

<p>Author: Tony Veale ; Yanfen Hao</p><p>Abstract: Large lexical resources, such as corpora and databases of Web ngrams, are a rich source of pre-fabricated phrases that can be reused in many different contexts. However, one must be careful in how these resources are used, and noted writers such as George Orwell have argued that the use of canned phrases encourages sloppy thinking and results in poor communication. Nonetheless, while Orwell prized home-made phrases over the readymade variety, there is a vibrant movement in modern art which shifts artistic creation from the production of novel artifacts to the clever reuse of readymades or objets trouvés. We describe here a system that makes creative reuse of the linguistic readymades in the Google ngrams. Our system, the Jigsaw Bard, thus owes more to Marcel Duchamp than to George Orwell. We demonstrate how textual readymades can be identified and harvested on a large scale, and used to drive a modest form of linguistic creativity. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.76997119 <a title="164-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Improving_Arabic_Dependency_Parsing_with_Form-based_and_Functional_Morphological_Features.html">164 acl-2011-Improving Arabic Dependency Parsing with Form-based and Functional Morphological Features</a></p>

We use unsupervised data to generate informative ‘condensed feature representations’ from the original feature set used in supervised NLP systems. The main contribution of our method is that it can offer dense and low-dimensional feature spaces for NLP tasks while maintaining the state-ofthe-art performance provided by the recently developed high-performance semi-supervised learning technique. Our method matches the results of current state-of-the-art systems with very few features, i.e., F-score 90.72 with 344 features for CoNLL-2003 NER data, and UAS 93.55 with 12.5K features for dependency parsing data derived from PTB-III. ,</p><p>5 0.64221656 <a title="164-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Template-Based_Information_Extraction_without_the_Templates.html">293 acl-2011-Template-Based Information Extraction without the Templates</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathanael Chambers ; Dan Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: Standard algorithms for template-based information extraction (IE) require predefined template schemas, and often labeled data, to learn to extract their slot fillers (e.g., an embassy is the Target of a Bombing template). This paper describes an approach to template-based IE that removes this requirement and performs extraction without knowing the template structure in advance. Our algorithm instead learns the template structure automatically from raw text, inducing template schemas as sets of linked events (e.g., bombings include detonate, set off, and destroy events) associated with semantic roles. We also solve the standard IE task, using the induced syntactic patterns to extract role fillers from specific documents. We evaluate on the MUC-4 terrorism dataset and show that we induce template structure very similar to handcreated gold structure, and we extract role fillers with an F1 score of .40, approaching the performance of algorithms that require full knowledge of the templates.</p><p>6 0.62626851 <a title="164-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Semi-supervised_latent_variable_models_for_sentence-level_sentiment_analysis.html">279 acl-2011-Semi-supervised latent variable models for sentence-level sentiment analysis</a></p>

</p><p>3 Through a systematic, large-scale study, we find to our surprise that as time goes by, web users are more likely to use questions to express their search intent. [sent-8, score-0.676]
</p><p>4 —  1 Introduction A web search query is the text users enter into the search box of a search engine to describe their infor-  mation need. [sent-9, score-1.132]
</p><p>5 Indeed, a natural way to seek information is to pose questions in a natural-language form (“how many calories in a banana”). [sent-11, score-0.196]
</p><p>6 Present day web search queries, however, have largely lost the original semantics of the word query: they tend to be fragmented phrases (“banana calories”) instead of questions. [sent-12, score-0.32]
</p><p>7 This could be a result of users learning to express their information need in search-enginefriendly forms: shorter queries fetch more results and content words determine relevance. [sent-13, score-0.678]
</p><p>8 We ask a simple question: as users become more familiar with the nuances of web search, are question-queries natural-language questions posed as queries gradually disappearing from the 135 search vernacular? [sent-14, score-1.04]
</p><p>9 If true, then the need for search engines to understand question-queries is moot. [sent-15, score-0.228]
</p><p>10 For specific phrases, one can observe how the fraction of query traffic containing the phrase1 changes over time. [sent-17, score-0.767]
</p><p>11 For instance, as shown next, the fraction of query traffic containing “how to” has in fact been going up since 2007. [sent-18, score-0.646]
</p><p>12 —  —  However,suchanecdotalevidencecan otfuly  support claims about general behavior in query formulation. [sent-19, score-0.373]
</p><p>13 In particular, this upward trend could be due to changes in the kind of information users are now seeking from the Web, e. [sent-20, score-0.611]
</p><p>14 , as a result of growing popularity of Q&A; sites or as people entrust search engines with more complex information needs; supporting the latter, in a very recent study, Aula et al. [sent-22, score-0.374]
</p><p>15 (2010) noted that users tend to formulate more question-queries when faced with difficult search tasks. [sent-23, score-0.439]
</p><p>16 We, on the other hand, are interested in a more subtle trend: for content that could easily be reached via non-question-queries, are people more likely to use question-queries over time? [sent-24, score-0.104]
</p><p>17 We perform a systematic study of questionqueries in web search. [sent-25, score-0.138]
</p><p>18 We find that question-queries account for ∼ 2% of all the query traffic and ∼ 6% aofc caollu unique queries. [sent-26, score-0.614]
</p><p>19 The study of long-term temporal behavior of question-queries, we believe, is novel. [sent-34, score-0.149]
</p><p>20 Previous work has explored building question-answering systems using web knowledge and Wikipedia (see Dumais et al. [sent-35, score-0.106]
</p><p>21 Our findings call for a greater synergy between QA and IR in the web search context and an improved understanding of question-queries by search engines. [sent-37, score-0.416]
</p><p>22 2  Related work  There has been some work on studying and exploiting linguistic structure in web queries. [sent-38, score-0.162]
</p><p>23 Spink and Ozmultu (2002) investigate the difference in user behavior between a search engine that encouraged questions and one that did not; they did not explore intent aspects. [sent-39, score-0.654]
</p><p>24 There has been some work on short-term (hourly) temporal analysis of query logs, e. [sent-45, score-0.36]

</p><p>26 3  Method  We address the main thesis of the work by retrospectively studying queries issued to a search engine over the course of 12 consecutive months. [sent-58, score-0.731]

</p><p>31 We work with the set of queries collected between Dec 2009 and Nov 2010 from the Yahoo! [sent-76, score-0.362]
</p><p>32 We gradually refine this raw data to study changes in query formulation  over comparable and consistent search intents. [sent-78, score-0.634]
</p><p>33 Sall consists of all incoming search queries after preprocessing: browser cookies2 that correspond to possible robots/automated queries and queries with non-alphanumeric characters are discarded; all punctuations, with the exception of “ ? [sent-80, score-1.375]
</p><p>34 Call consists of queries formulated for similar search intent, where intent was approximated by the result URL clicked in response to the query. [sent-83, score-0.84]
</p><p>35 That is, we assume queries that lead to a click on the same URL are issued with similar information need. [sent-84, score-0.605]
</p><p>36 To reduce the noise introduced by this approximation when users explore beyond their original intent, we focus on (query, URL) pairs where the URL u was clicked from top-10 search results3 for query q. [sent-85, score-0.804]
</p><p>37 UQc50 is our final dataset with queries grouped over “sQtable” intents. [sent-87, score-0.362]
</p><p>38 First, for each month m, we collect the multiset Ci of all (q, ui) pairs for each clicked URL ui, where the size of Ci is the total number of clicks received by ui during m. [sent-88, score-0.451]

</p><p>43 UQc50 consists of a random sample of such URLs, wQith 423,672 unique URLs and 23 1M unique queries (of which 21M (9%) are Q-queries). [sent-103, score-0.472]

</p><p>51 As a result, most function 137 words are treated as stopwords in IR systems, and web users often exclude them from queries. [sent-121, score-0.339]
</p><p>52 A high fraction of function words is a signal of queries behaving more like normal texts in terms ofthe amount of tokens “spent” to be structurally complete. [sent-122, score-0.524]
</p><p>53 oTnh farto is, “thheow in pfiuntd s network key” becomes “find network key”, with zero contribution to the probability mass of function words. [sent-126, score-0.136]

</p><p>56 All datasets went through the same query preprocessing steps, as well as the Q-word-removal step described above. [sent-131, score-0.308]

</p><p>62 2 Trend of Q-level We have just confirmed that Q-queries resemble natural-language questions to a cQe-rqtauienr degree. [sent-158, score-0.133]
</p><p>63 To this end, we compute a linear regression of Q-level across 12 months, conduct a hypothesis toefs tQ (with lth aec rnouslsl hypothesis being tchte slope othfe etshies regression equal to zero), and report the P-value for two-tailed t-test. [sent-160, score-0.114]

<p>Author: Patrick Pantel ; Ariel Fuxman</p><p>Abstract: We propose methods for estimating the probability that an entity from an entity database is associated with a web search query. Association is modeled using a query entity click graph, blending general query click logs with vertical query click logs. Smoothing techniques are proposed to address the inherent data sparsity in such graphs, including interpolation using a query synonymy model. A large-scale empirical analysis of the smoothing techniques, over a 2-year click graph collected from a commercial search engine, shows significant reductions in modeling error. The association models are then applied to the task of recommending products to web queries, by annotating queries with products from a large catalog and then mining query- product associations through web search session analysis. Experimental analysis shows that our smoothing techniques improve coverage while keeping precision stable, and overall, that our top-performing model affects 9% of general web queries with 94% precision.</p><p>3 0.33768126 <a title="271-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Joint_Annotation_of_Search_Queries.html">182 acl-2011-Joint Annotation of Search Queries</a></p>

As previous research shows, these differences severely limit the applicability of Marking up search queries with linguistic annotations such as part-of-speech tags, capitalization, and segmentation, is an impor- tant part of query processing and understanding in information retrieval systems. Due to their brevity and idiosyncratic structure, search queries pose a challenge to existing NLP tools. To address this challenge, we propose a probabilistic approach for performing joint query annotation. First, we derive a robust set of unsupervised independent annotations, using queries and pseudo-relevance feedback.

<p>Author: Joseph Reisinger ; Marius Pasca</p><p>Abstract: We develop a novel approach to the semantic analysis of short text segments and demonstrate its utility on a large corpus of Web search queries. Extracting meaning from short text segments is difficult as there is little semantic redundancy between terms; hence methods based on shallow semantic analysis may fail to accurately estimate meaning. Furthermore search queries lack explicit syntax often used to determine intent in question answering. In this paper we propose a hybrid model of semantic analysis combining explicit class-label extraction with a latent class PCFG. This class-label correlation (CLC) model admits a robust parallel approximation, allowing it to scale to large amounts of query data. We demonstrate its performance in terms of (1) its predicted label accuracy on polysemous queries and (2) its ability to accurately chunk queries into base constituents.</p><p>6 0.24110298 <a title="271-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Query_Weighting_for_Ranking_Model_Adaptation.html">256 acl-2011-Query Weighting for Ranking Model Adaptation</a></p>

<p>Author: Bo Pang ; Ravi Kumar</p><p>Abstract: Web search is an information-seeking activity. Often times, this amounts to a user seeking answers to a question. However, queries, which encode user’s information need, are typically not expressed as full-length natural language sentences in particular, as questions. Rather, they consist of one or more text fragments. As humans become more searchengine-savvy, do natural-language questions still have a role to play in web search? Through a systematic, large-scale study, we find to our surprise that as time goes by, web users are more likely to use questions to express their search intent. —</p><p>2 0.90475738 <a title="271-lsi-2" href="./acl-2011-Jigs_and_Lures%3A_Associating_Web_Queries_with_Structured_Entities.html">181 acl-2011-Jigs and Lures: Associating Web Queries with Structured Entities</a></p>
<p>Author: Patrick Pantel ; Ariel Fuxman</p><p>Abstract: We propose methods for estimating the probability that an entity from an entity database is associated with a web search query. Association is modeled using a query entity click graph, blending general query click logs with vertical query click logs. Smoothing techniques are proposed to address the inherent data sparsity in such graphs, including interpolation using a query synonymy model. A large-scale empirical analysis of the smoothing techniques, over a 2-year click graph collected from a commercial search engine, shows significant reductions in modeling error. The association models are then applied to the task of recommending products to web queries, by annotating queries with products from a large catalog and then mining query- product associations through web search session analysis. Experimental analysis shows that our smoothing techniques improve coverage while keeping precision stable, and overall, that our top-performing model affects 9% of general web queries with 94% precision.</p><p>3 0.85573411 <a title="271-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-Joint_Annotation_of_Search_Queries.html">182 acl-2011-Joint Annotation of Search Queries</a></p>

As previous research shows, these differences severely limit the applicability of Marking up search queries with linguistic annotations such as part-of-speech tags, capitalization, and segmentation, is an impor- tant part of query processing and understanding in information retrieval systems. Due to their brevity and idiosyncratic structure, search queries pose a challenge to existing NLP tools. To address this challenge, we propose a probabilistic approach for performing joint query annotation. First, we derive a robust set of unsupervised independent annotations, using queries and pseudo-relevance feedback. Then, we stack additional classifiers on the independent annotations, and exploit the dependencies between them to further improve the accuracy, even with a very limited amount of available training data. We evaluate our method using a range of queries extracted from a web search log.

Our classifier uses a variety of linguistic features, including lexical, syntactic, lexicosyntactic, and contextual features. To overcome an extremely unbalanced distribution of assertion types in the data set, we focused our efforts on adding features specifically to improve the performance of minority classes. As a result, our system reached 94. 17% micro-averaged and 79.76% macro-averaged F1-measures, and showed substantial recall gains on the minority classes. 1</p><p>3 0.6484251 <a title="271-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-N-Best_Rescoring_Based_on_Pitch-accent_Patterns.html">228 acl-2011-N-Best Rescoring Based on Pitch-accent Patterns</a></p>
<p>Author: Je Hun Jeon ; Wen Wang ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we adopt an n-best rescoring scheme using pitch-accent patterns to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance. The pitch-accent model is decoupled from the main ASR system, thus allowing us to develop it independently. N-best hypotheses from recognizers are rescored by additional scores that measure the correlation of the pitch-accent patterns between the acoustic signal and lexical cues. To test the robustness of our algorithm, we use two different data sets and recognition setups: the first one is English radio news data that has pitch accent labels, but the recognizer is trained from a small amount ofdata and has high error rate; the second one is English broadcast news data using a state-of-the-art SRI recognizer. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach is able to reduce word error rate relatively by about 3%. This gain is consistent across the two different tests, showing promising future directions of incorporating prosodic information to improve speech recognition.</p><p>4 0.62111461 <a title="271-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Piggyback%3A_Using_Search_Engines_for_Robust_Cross-Domain_Named_Entity_Recognition.html">246 acl-2011-Piggyback: Using Search Engines for Robust Cross-Domain Named Entity Recognition</a></p>

The key novelty of the method is that we submit a token with context to a search engine and use similar contexts in the search results as additional information for correctly classifying the token. We achieve strong gains in NER performance on news, in-domain and out-of-domain, and on web queries.</p><p>5 0.5978089 <a title="271-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Grammatical_Error_Correction_with_Alternating_Structure_Optimization.html">147 acl-2011-Grammatical Error Correction with Alternating Structure Optimization</a></p>

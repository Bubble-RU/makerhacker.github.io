<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2011-298-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P11/P11-4002.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Ulrich Schafer ; Bernd Kiefer ; Christian Spurk ; Jorg Steffen ; Rui Wang</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel application for structured search in scientific digital libraries. The ACL Anthology Searchbench is meant to become a publicly available research tool to query the content of the ACL Anthology. The application provides search in both its bibliographic metadata and semantically analyzed full textual content. By combining these two features, very efficient and focused queries are possible. At the same time, the application serves as a showcase for the recent progress in natural language processing (NLP) research and language technology. The system currently indexes the textual content of 7,500 anthology papers from 2002–2009 with predicateargument-like semantic structures. It also provides useful search filters based on bibliographic metadata. It will be extended to provide the full anthology content and en- . hanced functionality based on further NLP techniques. 1 Introduction and Motivation Scientists in all disciplines nowadays are faced with a flood of new publications every day. In addition, more and more publications from the past become digitally available and thus even increase the amount. Finding relevant information and avoiding duplication of work have become urgent issues to be addressed by the scientific community. The organization and preservation of scientific knowledge in scientific publications, vulgo text documents, thwarts these efforts. From a viewpoint of 7 dfki .de / lt a computer scientist, scientific papers are just ‘unstructured information’ . At least in our own scientific community, Computational Linguistics, it is generally assumed that NLP could help to support search in such document collections. The ACL Anthology1 is a comprehensive elec- tronic collection of scientific papers in our own field (Bird et al., 2008). It is updated regularly with new publications, but also older papers have been scanned and are made available electronically. We have implemented the ACL Anthology Searchbench2 for two reasons: Our first aim is to provide a more targeted search facility in this collection than standard web search on the anthology website. In this sense, the Searchbench is meant to become a service to our own community. Our second motivation is to use the developed system as a showcase for the progress that has been made over the last years in precision-oriented deep linguistic parsing in terms of both efficiency and coverage, specifically in the context of the DELPHIN community3. Our system also uses further NLP techniques such as unsupervised term extraction, named entity recognition and part-of-speech (PoS) tagging. By automatically precomputing normalized semantic representations (predicate-argument structure) of each sentence in the anthology, the search space is structured and allows to find equivalent or related predicates even if they are expressed differ- 1http : / /www . aclweb .org/ anthology 2http : //aclasb . dfki . de 3http : / /www . de lph-in . net – DELPH-IN stands for DEep Linguistic Processing with HPSG INitiative.

In addition, the Searchbench also provides detailed bibliographic metadata for filtering as well as autosuggest texts for input fields computed from the corpus two further key features one can expect from such systems today, nevertheless very important for efficient search in digital libraries. We describe the offline preprocessing and deep parsing approach in Section 2. Section 3 concentrates on the generation of the semantic search index. In Section 4, we describe the search interface. We conclude in Section 5 and present an outlook to future extensions. – 2 Parsing the ACL Anthology The basis of the search index for the ACL Anthology are its original PDF documents, currently 8,200 from the years 2002 through 2009. To overcome quality problems in text extraction from PDF, we use a commercial PDF extractor based on OCR techniques. This approach guarantees uniform and highquality textual representations even from older papers in the anthology (before 2000) which mostly were scanned from printed paper versions. The general idea of the semantics-oriented access to scholarly paper content is to parse each sentence they contain with the open-source HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994) grammar for English (ERG; Flickinger (2002)) and then distill and index semantically structured representations for search. To make the deep parser robust, it is embedded in a NLP workflow. The coverage (percentage of full deeply parsed sentences) on the anthology corpus could be increased from 65 % to now more than 85 % through careful combination of several robustness techniques; for example: (1) chart pruning, directed search during parsing to increase per- formance, and also coverage for longer sentences (Cramer and Zhang, 2010); (2) chart mapping, a novel method for integrating preprocessing information in exactly the way the deep grammar expects it (Adolphs et al., 2008); (3) new version of the ERG with better handling of open word classes; (4) 8 more fine-grained named entity recognition, including recognition of citation patterns; (5) new, better suited parse ranking model (WeScience; Flickinger et al. (2010)). Because of limited space, we will focus on (1) and (2) below. A more detailed description and further results are available in (Sch a¨fer and Kiefer, 2011). Except for a small part of the named entity recognition components (citations, some terminology) and the parse ranking model, there are no further adaptations to genre or domain of the text corpus. This implies that the NLP workflow could be easily and modularly adapted to other (scientific or nonscientific) domains—mainly thanks to the generic and comprehensive language modelling in the ERG. The NLP preprocessing component workflow is implemented using the Heart of Gold NLP middleware architecture (Sch a¨fer, 2006). It starts with sentence boundary detection (SBR) and regular expression-based tokenization using its built-in component JTok, followed by the trigram-based PoS tagger TnT (Brants, 2000) trained on the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and the named entity recognizer SProUT (Dro z˙d z˙y n´ski et al., 2004). 2.1 Precise Preprocessing Integration with Chart Mapping Tagger output is combined with information from the named entity recognizer, e.g. delivering hypothetical information on citation expressions. The combined result is delivered as input to the deep parser PET (Callmeier, 2000) running the ERG. Here, citations, for example, can be treated as either persons, locations or appositions. Concerning punctuation, the ERG can make use of information on opening and closing quotation marks. Such information is often not explicit in the input text, e.g. when, as in our setup, gained through OCR which does not distinguish between ‘ and ’ or “ and However, a tokenizer can often guess (recon- ”. struct) leftness and rightness correctly. This information, passed to the deep parser via chart mapping, helps it to disambiguate. 2.2 Increased Processing Speed and Coverage through Chart Pruning In addition to a well-established discriminative maximum entropy model for post-analysis parse selection, we use an additional generative model as described in Cramer and Zhang (2010) to restrict the search space during parsing. This restriction increases efficiency, but also coverage, because the parse time was restricted to at most 60 CPU seconds on a standard PC, and more sentences could now be parsed within these bounds. A 4 GB limit for main memory consumption was far beyond what was ever needed. We saw a small but negligible decrease in parsing accuracy, 5.4 % best parses were not found due to the pruning of important chart edges. Ninomiya et al. (2006) did a very thorough comparison ofdifferent performance optimization strategies, and among those also a local pruning strategy similar to the one used here. There is an important difference between the systems, in that theirs works on a reduced context-free backbone first and reconstructs the results with the full grammar, while PET uses the HPSG grammar directly, with subsumption packing and partial unpacking to achieve a similar effect as the packed chart of a context-free parser. sentence length −→ Figure 1: Distribution of sentence length and mean parse times for mild pruning In total, we parsed 1,537,801 sentences, of which 57,832 (3.8 %) could not be parsed because of lexicon errors. Most of them were caused by OCR ar- tifacts resulting in unexpected punctuation character combinations. These can be identified and will be deleted in the future. Figure 1 displays the average parse time of processing with a mild chart pruning setting, together with the mean quadratic error. In addition, it contains the distribution of input sentences over sentence length. Obviously, the vast majority of sen9 tences has a length of at most 60 words4. The parse times only grow mildly due to the many optimization techniques in the original system, and also the new chart pruning method. The sentence length distribution has been integrated into Figure 1 to show that the predominant part of our real-world corpus can be processed using this information-rich method with very low parse times (overall average parse time < 2 s per sentence). The large amount of short inputs is at first surprising, even more so that most of these inputs can not be parsed. Most of these inputs are non-sentences such as headings, enumerations, footnotes, table cell content. There are several alternatives to deal with such input, one to identify and handle them in a preprocessing step, another to use a special root condition in the deep analysis component that is able to combine phrases with well-defined properties for inputs where no spanning result could be found. We employed the second method, which has the advantage that it handles a larger range of phenomena in a homogeneous way. Figure 2 shows the change in percentage of unparsed and timed out inputs for the mild pruning method with and without the root condition combining fragments. sentence length −→ Figure 2: Unparsed and timed out sentences with and without fragment combination Figure 2 shows that this changes the curve for unparsed sentences towards more expected characteristics and removes the uncommonly high percentage of short sentences for which no parse can be computed. Together with the parses for fragmented 4It has to be pointed out that extremely long sentences also may be non-sentences resulting from PDF extraction errors, missing punctuation etc. No manual correction took place. Figure 3: Multiple semantic tuples may be generated for a sentence input, we get a recall (sentences with at least one parse) over the whole corpus of 85.9 % (1,321,336 sentences), without a significant change for any of the other measures, and with potential for further improvement. 3 Semantic Tuple Extraction with DMRS In contrast to shallow parsers, the ERG not only handles detailed syntactic analyses of phrases, com- pounds, coordination, negation and other linguistic phenomena that are important for extracting semantic relations, but also generates a formal semantic representation of the meaning of the input sentence in the Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) representation format (Copestake et al., 2005). It consists of elementary predications for each word and larger constituents, connected via argument positions and variables, from which predicate-argument structure can be extracted. MRS representations resulting from deep parsing are still relatively close to linguistic structures and contain more detailed information than a user would like to query and search for. Therefore, an additional extraction and abstraction step is performed before storing semantic structures in the search index. Firstly, MRS is converted to DMRS (Copestake, 2009), a dependency-style version of MRS that eases extraction of predicate-argument structure using the implementation in LKB (Copestake, 2002). The representation format we devised for the search index we call semantic tuples, in fact quintuples</p><p>Reference: <a title="acl-2011-298-reference" href="../acl2011_reference/acl-2011-The_ACL_Anthology_Searchbench_reference.html">text</a></p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 The ACL Anthology Searchbench Ulrich Sch a¨fer  Bernd Kiefer Christian Spurk J o¨rg Steffen Rui Wang Language Technology Lab German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) D-66123 Saarbr¨ ucken, Germany { ulrich .

The ACL Anthology1 is a comprehensive elec- tronic collection of scientific papers in our own field (Bird et al., 2008). It is updated regularly with new publications, but also older papers have been scanned and are made available electronically. We have implemented the ACL Anthology Searchbench2 for two reasons: Our first aim is to provide a more targeted search facility in this collection than standard web search on the anthology website. In this sense, the Searchbench is meant to become a service to our own community. Our second motivation is to use the developed system as a showcase for the progress that has been made over the last years in precision-oriented deep linguistic parsing in terms of both efficiency and coverage, specifically in the context of the DELPHIN community3. Our system also uses further NLP techniques such as unsupervised term extraction, named entity recognition and part-of-speech (PoS) tagging.

In addition, the Searchbench also provides detailed bibliographic metadata for filtering as well as autosuggest texts for input fields computed from the corpus two further key features one can expect from such systems today, nevertheless very important for efficient search in digital libraries. We describe the offline preprocessing and deep parsing approach in Section 2. Section 3 concentrates on the generation of the semantic search index. In Section 4, we describe the search interface. We conclude in Section 5 and present an outlook to future extensions. – 2 Parsing the ACL Anthology The basis of the search index for the ACL Anthology are its original PDF documents, currently 8,200 from the years 2002 through 2009. To overcome quality problems in text extraction from PDF, we use a commercial PDF extractor based on OCR techniques. This approach guarantees uniform and highquality textual representations even from older papers in the anthology (before 2000) which mostly were scanned from printed paper versions. The general idea of the semantics-oriented access to scholarly paper content is to parse each sentence they contain with the open-source HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994) grammar for English (ERG; Flickinger (2002)) and then distill and index semantically structured representations for search. To make the deep parser robust, it is embedded in a NLP workflow. The coverage (percentage of full deeply parsed sentences) on the anthology corpus could be increased from 65 % to now more than 85 % through careful combination of several robustness techniques; for example: (1) chart pruning, directed search during parsing to increase per- formance, and also coverage for longer sentences (Cramer and Zhang, 2010); (2) chart mapping, a novel method for integrating preprocessing information in exactly the way the deep grammar expects it (Adolphs et al., 2008); (3) new version of the ERG with better handling of open word classes; (4) 8 more fine-grained named entity recognition, including recognition of citation patterns; (5) new, better suited parse ranking model (WeScience; Flickinger et al. (2010)). Because of limited space, we will focus on (1) and (2) below. A more detailed description and further results are available in (Sch a¨fer and Kiefer, 2011). Except for a small part of the named entity recognition components (citations, some terminology) and the parse ranking model, there are no further adaptations to genre or domain of the text corpus. This implies that the NLP workflow could be easily and modularly adapted to other (scientific or nonscientific) domains—mainly thanks to the generic and comprehensive language modelling in the ERG. The NLP preprocessing component workflow is implemented using the Heart of Gold NLP middleware architecture (Sch a¨fer, 2006). It starts with sentence boundary detection (SBR) and regular expression-based tokenization using its built-in component JTok, followed by the trigram-based PoS tagger TnT (Brants, 2000) trained on the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and the named entity recognizer SProUT (Dro z˙d z˙y n´ski et al., 2004). 2.1 Precise Preprocessing Integration with Chart Mapping Tagger output is combined with information from the named entity recognizer, e.g. delivering hypothetical information on citation expressions. The combined result is delivered as input to the deep parser PET (Callmeier, 2000) running the ERG. Here, citations, for example, can be treated as either persons, locations or appositions. Concerning punctuation, the ERG can make use of information on opening and closing quotation marks. Such information is often not explicit in the input text, e.g. when, as in our setup, gained through OCR which does not distinguish between ‘ and ’ or “ and However, a tokenizer can often guess (recon- ”. struct) leftness and rightness correctly. This information, passed to the deep parser via chart mapping, helps it to disambiguate. 2.2 Increased Processing Speed and Coverage through Chart Pruning In addition to a well-established discriminative maximum entropy model for post-analysis parse selection, we use an additional generative model as described in Cramer and Zhang (2010) to restrict the search space during parsing. This restriction increases efficiency, but also coverage, because the parse time was restricted to at most 60 CPU seconds on a standard PC, and more sentences could now be parsed within these bounds. A 4 GB limit for main memory consumption was far beyond what was ever needed. We saw a small but negligible decrease in parsing accuracy, 5.4 % best parses were not found due to the pruning of important chart edges. Ninomiya et al. (2006) did a very thorough comparison ofdifferent performance optimization strategies, and among those also a local pruning strategy similar to the one used here. There is an important difference between the systems, in that theirs works on a reduced context-free backbone first and reconstructs the results with the full grammar, while PET uses the HPSG grammar directly, with subsumption packing and partial unpacking to achieve a similar effect as the packed chart of a context-free parser. sentence length −→ Figure 1: Distribution of sentence length and mean parse times for mild pruning In total, we parsed 1,537,801 sentences, of which 57,832 (3.8 %) could not be parsed because of lexicon errors. Most of them were caused by OCR ar- tifacts resulting in unexpected punctuation character combinations. These can be identified and will be deleted in the future. Figure 1 displays the average parse time of processing with a mild chart pruning setting, together with the mean quadratic error. In addition, it contains the distribution of input sentences over sentence length. Obviously, the vast majority of sen9 tences has a length of at most 60 words4. The parse times only grow mildly due to the many optimization techniques in the original system, and also the new chart pruning method. The sentence length distribution has been integrated into Figure 1 to show that the predominant part of our real-world corpus can be processed using this information-rich method with very low parse times (overall average parse time < 2 s per sentence). The large amount of short inputs is at first surprising, even more so that most of these inputs can not be parsed. Most of these inputs are non-sentences such as headings, enumerations, footnotes, table cell content. There are several alternatives to deal with such input, one to identify and handle them in a preprocessing step, another to use a special root condition in the deep analysis component that is able to combine phrases with well-defined properties for inputs where no spanning result could be found. We employed the second method, which has the advantage that it handles a larger range of phenomena in a homogeneous way. Figure 2 shows the change in percentage of unparsed and timed out inputs for the mild pruning method with and without the root condition combining fragments. sentence length −→ Figure 2: Unparsed and timed out sentences with and without fragment combination Figure 2 shows that this changes the curve for unparsed sentences towards more expected characteristics and removes the uncommonly high percentage of short sentences for which no parse can be computed. Together with the parses for fragmented 4It has to be pointed out that extremely long sentences also may be non-sentences resulting from PDF extraction errors, missing punctuation etc. No manual correction took place. Figure 3: Multiple semantic tuples may be generated for a sentence input, we get a recall (sentences with at least one parse) over the whole corpus of 85.9 % (1,321,336 sentences), without a significant change for any of the other measures, and with potential for further improvement. 3 Semantic Tuple Extraction with DMRS In contrast to shallow parsers, the ERG not only handles detailed syntactic analyses of phrases, com- pounds, coordination, negation and other linguistic phenomena that are important for extracting semantic relations, but also generates a formal semantic representation of the meaning of the input sentence in the Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) representation format (Copestake et al., 2005). It consists of elementary predications for each word and larger constituents, connected via argument positions and variables, from which predicate-argument structure can be extracted. MRS representations resulting from deep parsing are still relatively close to linguistic structures and contain more detailed information than a user would like to query and search for. Therefore, an additional extraction and abstraction step is performed before storing semantic structures in the search index. Firstly, MRS is converted to DMRS (Copestake, 2009), a dependency-style version of MRS that eases extraction of predicate-argument structure using the implementation in LKB (Copestake, 2002). The representation format we devised for the search index we call semantic tuples, in fact quintuples</p><p>2 0.17433123 <a title="298-tfidf-2" href="./acl-2011-Beam-Width_Prediction_for_Efficient_Context-Free_Parsing.html">58 acl-2011-Beam-Width Prediction for Efficient Context-Free Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathan Bodenstab ; Aaron Dunlop ; Keith Hall ; Brian Roark</p><p>Abstract: Efficient decoding for syntactic parsing has become a necessary research area as statistical grammars grow in accuracy and size and as more NLP applications leverage syntactic analyses. We review prior methods for pruning and then present a new framework that unifies their strengths into a single approach. Using a log linear model, we learn the optimal beam-search pruning parameters for each CYK chart cell, effectively predicting the most promising areas of the model space to explore. We demonstrate that our method is faster than coarse-to-fine pruning, exemplified in both the Charniak and Berkeley parsers, by empirically comparing our parser to the Berkeley parser using the same grammar and under identical operating conditions.</p><p>3 0.13267085 <a title="298-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Sentiment_Analysis_of_Citations_using_Sentence_Structure-Based_Features.html">281 acl-2011-Sentiment Analysis of Citations using Sentence Structure-Based Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Awais Athar</p><p>Abstract: Sentiment analysis of citations in scientific papers and articles is a new and interesting problem due to the many linguistic differences between scientific texts and other genres. In this paper, we focus on the problem of automatic identification of positive and negative sentiment polarity in citations to scientific papers. Using a newly constructed annotated citation sentiment corpus, we explore the effectiveness of existing and novel features, including n-grams, specialised science-specific lexical features, dependency relations, sentence splitting and negation features. Our results show that 3-grams and dependencies perform best in this task; they outperform the sentence splitting, science lexicon and negation based features.</p><p>4 0.12191756 <a title="298-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Unary_Constraints_for_Efficient_Context-Free_Parsing.html">316 acl-2011-Unary Constraints for Efficient Context-Free Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathan Bodenstab ; Kristy Hollingshead ; Brian Roark</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel pruning method for context-free parsing that increases efficiency by disallowing phrase-level unary productions in CKY chart cells spanning a single word. Our work is orthogonal to recent work on “closing” chart cells, which has focused on multi-word constituents, leaving span-1 chart cells unpruned. We show that a simple discriminative classifier can learn with high accuracy which span-1 chart cells to close to phrase-level unary productions. Eliminating these unary productions from the search can have a large impact on downstream processing, depending on implementation details of the search. We apply our method to four parsing architectures and demonstrate how it is complementary to the cell-closing paradigm, as well as other pruning methods such as coarse-to-fine, agenda, and beam-search pruning.</p><p>5 0.10896607 <a title="298-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Coherent_Citation-Based_Summarization_of_Scientific_Papers.html">71 acl-2011-Coherent Citation-Based Summarization of Scientific Papers</a></p>
<p>Author: Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: In citation-based summarization, text written by several researchers is leveraged to identify the important aspects of a target paper. Previous work on this problem focused almost exclusively on its extraction aspect (i.e. selecting a representative set of citation sentences that highlight the contribution of the target paper). Meanwhile, the fluency of the produced summaries has been mostly ignored. For example, diversity, readability, cohesion, and ordering of the sentences included in the summary have not been thoroughly considered. This resulted in noisy and confusing summaries. In this work, we present an approach for producing readable and cohesive citation-based summaries. Our experiments show that the pro- posed approach outperforms several baselines in terms of both extraction quality and fluency.</p><p>6 0.098765649 <a title="298-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-SciSumm%3A_A_Multi-Document_Summarization_System_for_Scientific_Articles.html">270 acl-2011-SciSumm: A Multi-Document Summarization System for Scientific Articles</a></p>

<p>Author: Ulrich Schafer ; Bernd Kiefer ; Christian Spurk ; Jorg Steffen ; Rui Wang</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel application for structured search in scientific digital libraries. The ACL Anthology Searchbench is meant to become a publicly available research tool to query the content of the ACL Anthology. The application provides search in both its bibliographic metadata and semantically analyzed full textual content. By combining these two features, very efficient and focused queries are possible. At the same time, the application serves as a showcase for the recent progress in natural language processing (NLP) research and language technology. The system currently indexes the textual content of 7,500 anthology papers from 2002–2009 with predicateargument-like semantic structures. It also provides useful search filters based on bibliographic metadata. It will be extended to provide the full anthology content and en- . hanced functionality based on further NLP techniques. 1 Introduction and Motivation Scientists in all disciplines nowadays are faced with a flood of new publications every day. In addition, more and more publications from the past become digitally available and thus even increase the amount. Finding relevant information and avoiding duplication of work have become urgent issues to be addressed by the scientific community.

<p>Author: Nathan Bodenstab ; Aaron Dunlop ; Keith Hall ; Brian Roark</p><p>Abstract: Efficient decoding for syntactic parsing has become a necessary research area as statistical grammars grow in accuracy and size and as more NLP applications leverage syntactic analyses. We review prior methods for pruning and then present a new framework that unifies their strengths into a single approach. Using a log linear model, we learn the optimal beam-search pruning parameters for each CYK chart cell, effectively predicting the most promising areas of the model space to explore. We demonstrate that our method is faster than coarse-to-fine pruning, exemplified in both the Charniak and Berkeley parsers, by empirically comparing our parser to the Berkeley parser using the same grammar and under identical operating conditions.</p><p>3 0.69498593 <a title="298-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-Unary_Constraints_for_Efficient_Context-Free_Parsing.html">316 acl-2011-Unary Constraints for Efficient Context-Free Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathan Bodenstab ; Kristy Hollingshead ; Brian Roark</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel pruning method for context-free parsing that increases efficiency by disallowing phrase-level unary productions in CKY chart cells spanning a single word. Our work is orthogonal to recent work on “closing” chart cells, which has focused on multi-word constituents, leaving span-1 chart cells unpruned. We show that a simple discriminative classifier can learn with high accuracy which span-1 chart cells to close to phrase-level unary productions. Eliminating these unary productions from the search can have a large impact on downstream processing, depending on implementation details of the search. We apply our method to four parsing architectures and demonstrate how it is complementary to the cell-closing paradigm, as well as other pruning methods such as coarse-to-fine, agenda, and beam-search pruning.</p><p>4 0.63752294 <a title="298-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-The_Surprising_Variance_in_Shortest-Derivation_Parsing.html">300 acl-2011-The Surprising Variance in Shortest-Derivation Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohit Bansal ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We investigate full-scale shortest-derivation parsing (SDP), wherein the parser selects an analysis built from the fewest number of training fragments. Shortest derivation parsing exhibits an unusual range of behaviors. At one extreme, in the fully unpruned case, it is neither fast nor accurate. At the other extreme, when pruned with a coarse unlexicalized PCFG, the shortest derivation criterion becomes both fast and surprisingly effective, rivaling more complex weighted-fragment approaches. Our analysis includes an investigation of tie-breaking and associated dynamic programs. At its best, our parser achieves an accuracy of 87% F1 on the English WSJ task with minimal annotation, and 90% F1 with richer annotation.</p><p>5 0.60947359 <a title="298-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Metagrammar_engineering%3A_Towards_systematic_exploration_of_implemented_grammars.html">219 acl-2011-Metagrammar engineering: Towards systematic exploration of implemented grammars</a></p>
<p>Author: Antske Fokkens</p><p>Abstract: When designing grammars of natural language, typically, more than one formal analysis can account for a given phenomenon. Moreover, because analyses interact, the choices made by the engineer influence the possibilities available in further grammar development. The order in which phenomena are treated may therefore have a major impact on the resulting grammar. This paper proposes to tackle this problem by using metagrammar development as a methodology for grammar engineering. Iargue that metagrammar engineering as an approach facilitates the systematic exploration of grammars through comparison of competing analyses. The idea is illustrated through a comparative study of auxiliary structures in HPSG-based grammars for German and Dutch. Auxiliaries form a central phenomenon of German and Dutch and are likely to influence many components of the grammar. This study shows that a special auxiliary+verb construction significantly improves efficiency compared to the standard argument-composition analysis for both parsing and generation.</p><p>6 0.53721011 <a title="298-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Coherent_Citation-Based_Summarization_of_Scientific_Papers.html">71 acl-2011-Coherent Citation-Based Summarization of Scientific Papers</a></p>

<p>Author: Ulrich Schafer ; Bernd Kiefer ; Christian Spurk ; Jorg Steffen ; Rui Wang</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel application for structured search in scientific digital libraries. The ACL Anthology Searchbench is meant to become a publicly available research tool to query the content of the ACL Anthology. The application provides search in both its bibliographic metadata and semantically analyzed full textual content. By combining these two features, very efficient and focused queries are possible. At the same time, the application serves as a showcase for the recent progress in natural language processing (NLP) research and language technology. The system currently indexes the textual content of 7,500 anthology papers from 2002–2009 with predicateargument-like semantic structures. It also provides useful search filters based on bibliographic metadata. It will be extended to provide the full anthology content and en- . hanced functionality based on further NLP techniques. 1 Introduction and Motivation Scientists in all disciplines nowadays are faced with a flood of new publications every day. In addition, more and more publications from the past become digitally available and thus even increase the amount. Finding relevant information and avoiding duplication of work have become urgent issues to be addressed by the scientific community. The organization and preservation of scientific knowledge in scientific publications, vulgo text documents, thwarts these efforts. From a viewpoint of 7 dfki .de / lt a computer scientist, scientific papers are just ‘unstructured information’ . At least in our own scientific community, Computational Linguistics, it is generally assumed that NLP could help to support search in such document collections. The ACL Anthology1 is a comprehensive elec- tronic collection of scientific papers in our own field (Bird et al., 2008). It is updated regularly with new publications, but also older papers have been scanned and are made available electronically. We have implemented the ACL Anthology Searchbench2 for two reasons: Our first aim is to provide a more targeted search facility in this collection than standard web search on the anthology website. In this sense, the Searchbench is meant to become a service to our own community. Our second motivation is to use the developed system as a showcase for the progress that has been made over the last years in precision-oriented deep linguistic parsing in terms of both efficiency and coverage, specifically in the context of the DELPHIN community3. Our system also uses further NLP techniques such as unsupervised term extraction, named entity recognition and part-of-speech (PoS) tagging. By automatically precomputing normalized semantic representations (predicate-argument structure) of each sentence in the anthology, the search space is structured and allows to find equivalent or related predicates even if they are expressed differ- 1http : / /www . aclweb .org/ anthology 2http : //aclasb . dfki . de 3http : / /www . de lph-in . net – DELPH-IN stands for DEep Linguistic Processing with HPSG INitiative.

In addition, the Searchbench also provides detailed bibliographic metadata for filtering as well as autosuggest texts for input fields computed from the corpus two further key features one can expect from such systems today, nevertheless very important for efficient search in digital libraries. We describe the offline preprocessing and deep parsing approach in Section 2. Section 3 concentrates on the generation of the semantic search index. In Section 4, we describe the search interface. We conclude in Section 5 and present an outlook to future extensions. – 2 Parsing the ACL Anthology The basis of the search index for the ACL Anthology are its original PDF documents, currently 8,200 from the years 2002 through 2009. To overcome quality problems in text extraction from PDF, we use a commercial PDF extractor based on OCR techniques. This approach guarantees uniform and highquality textual representations even from older papers in the anthology (before 2000) which mostly were scanned from printed paper versions. The general idea of the semantics-oriented access to scholarly paper content is to parse each sentence they contain with the open-source HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994) grammar for English (ERG; Flickinger (2002)) and then distill and index semantically structured representations for search. To make the deep parser robust, it is embedded in a NLP workflow. The coverage (percentage of full deeply parsed sentences) on the anthology corpus could be increased from 65 % to now more than 85 % through careful combination of several robustness techniques; for example: (1) chart pruning, directed search during parsing to increase per- formance, and also coverage for longer sentences (Cramer and Zhang, 2010); (2) chart mapping, a novel method for integrating preprocessing information in exactly the way the deep grammar expects it (Adolphs et al., 2008); (3) new version of the ERG with better handling of open word classes; (4) 8 more fine-grained named entity recognition, including recognition of citation patterns; (5) new, better suited parse ranking model (WeScience; Flickinger et al. (2010)). Because of limited space, we will focus on (1) and (2) below. A more detailed description and further results are available in (Sch a¨fer and Kiefer, 2011). Except for a small part of the named entity recognition components (citations, some terminology) and the parse ranking model, there are no further adaptations to genre or domain of the text corpus. This implies that the NLP workflow could be easily and modularly adapted to other (scientific or nonscientific) domains—mainly thanks to the generic and comprehensive language modelling in the ERG. The NLP preprocessing component workflow is implemented using the Heart of Gold NLP middleware architecture (Sch a¨fer, 2006). It starts with sentence boundary detection (SBR) and regular expression-based tokenization using its built-in component JTok, followed by the trigram-based PoS tagger TnT (Brants, 2000) trained on the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and the named entity recognizer SProUT (Dro z˙d z˙y n´ski et al., 2004). 2.1 Precise Preprocessing Integration with Chart Mapping Tagger output is combined with information from the named entity recognizer, e.g. delivering hypothetical information on citation expressions. The combined result is delivered as input to the deep parser PET (Callmeier, 2000) running the ERG. Here, citations, for example, can be treated as either persons, locations or appositions. Concerning punctuation, the ERG can make use of information on opening and closing quotation marks. Such information is often not explicit in the input text, e.g. when, as in our setup, gained through OCR which does not distinguish between ‘ and ’ or “ and However, a tokenizer can often guess (recon- ”. struct) leftness and rightness correctly. This information, passed to the deep parser via chart mapping, helps it to disambiguate. 2.2 Increased Processing Speed and Coverage through Chart Pruning In addition to a well-established discriminative maximum entropy model for post-analysis parse selection, we use an additional generative model as described in Cramer and Zhang (2010) to restrict the search space during parsing. This restriction increases efficiency, but also coverage, because the parse time was restricted to at most 60 CPU seconds on a standard PC, and more sentences could now be parsed within these bounds. A 4 GB limit for main memory consumption was far beyond what was ever needed. We saw a small but negligible decrease in parsing accuracy, 5.4 % best parses were not found due to the pruning of important chart edges. Ninomiya et al. (2006) did a very thorough comparison ofdifferent performance optimization strategies, and among those also a local pruning strategy similar to the one used here. There is an important difference between the systems, in that theirs works on a reduced context-free backbone first and reconstructs the results with the full grammar, while PET uses the HPSG grammar directly, with subsumption packing and partial unpacking to achieve a similar effect as the packed chart of a context-free parser. sentence length −→ Figure 1: Distribution of sentence length and mean parse times for mild pruning In total, we parsed 1,537,801 sentences, of which 57,832 (3.8 %) could not be parsed because of lexicon errors. Most of them were caused by OCR ar- tifacts resulting in unexpected punctuation character combinations. These can be identified and will be deleted in the future. Figure 1 displays the average parse time of processing with a mild chart pruning setting, together with the mean quadratic error. In addition, it contains the distribution of input sentences over sentence length. Obviously, the vast majority of sen9 tences has a length of at most 60 words4. The parse times only grow mildly due to the many optimization techniques in the original system, and also the new chart pruning method. The sentence length distribution has been integrated into Figure 1 to show that the predominant part of our real-world corpus can be processed using this information-rich method with very low parse times (overall average parse time < 2 s per sentence). The large amount of short inputs is at first surprising, even more so that most of these inputs can not be parsed. Most of these inputs are non-sentences such as headings, enumerations, footnotes, table cell content. There are several alternatives to deal with such input, one to identify and handle them in a preprocessing step, another to use a special root condition in the deep analysis component that is able to combine phrases with well-defined properties for inputs where no spanning result could be found. We employed the second method, which has the advantage that it handles a larger range of phenomena in a homogeneous way. Figure 2 shows the change in percentage of unparsed and timed out inputs for the mild pruning method with and without the root condition combining fragments. sentence length −→ Figure 2: Unparsed and timed out sentences with and without fragment combination Figure 2 shows that this changes the curve for unparsed sentences towards more expected characteristics and removes the uncommonly high percentage of short sentences for which no parse can be computed. Together with the parses for fragmented 4It has to be pointed out that extremely long sentences also may be non-sentences resulting from PDF extraction errors, missing punctuation etc. No manual correction took place. Figure 3: Multiple semantic tuples may be generated for a sentence input, we get a recall (sentences with at least one parse) over the whole corpus of 85.9 % (1,321,336 sentences), without a significant change for any of the other measures, and with potential for further improvement. 3 Semantic Tuple Extraction with DMRS In contrast to shallow parsers, the ERG not only handles detailed syntactic analyses of phrases, com- pounds, coordination, negation and other linguistic phenomena that are important for extracting semantic relations, but also generates a formal semantic representation of the meaning of the input sentence in the Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) representation format (Copestake et al., 2005). It consists of elementary predications for each word and larger constituents, connected via argument positions and variables, from which predicate-argument structure can be extracted. MRS representations resulting from deep parsing are still relatively close to linguistic structures and contain more detailed information than a user would like to query and search for. Therefore, an additional extraction and abstraction step is performed before storing semantic structures in the search index. Firstly, MRS is converted to DMRS (Copestake, 2009), a dependency-style version of MRS that eases extraction of predicate-argument structure using the implementation in LKB (Copestake, 2002).

We also provide a computational model for automatically annotating text using this coding scheme, using supervised learning enhanced by constraints implemented with Integer Linear Programming. We show that this constrained model’s analyses of speaker authority correlates very strongly with expert human judgments (r2 coefficient of 0.947).</p><p>4 0.80761391 <a title="298-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Language_of_Vandalism%3A_Improving_Wikipedia_Vandalism_Detection_via_Stylometric_Analysis.html">195 acl-2011-Language of Vandalism: Improving Wikipedia Vandalism Detection via Stylometric Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Manoj Harpalani ; Michael Hart ; Sandesh Signh ; Rob Johnson ; Yejin Choi</p><p>Abstract: Community-based knowledge forums, such as Wikipedia, are susceptible to vandalism, i.e., ill-intentioned contributions that are detrimental to the quality of collective intelligence. Most previous work to date relies on shallow lexico-syntactic patterns and metadata to automatically detect vandalism in Wikipedia. In this paper, we explore more linguistically motivated approaches to vandalism detection. In particular, we hypothesize that textual vandalism constitutes a unique genre where a group of people share a similar linguistic behavior. Experimental results suggest that (1) statistical models give evidence to unique language styles in vandalism, and that (2) deep syntactic patterns based on probabilistic context free grammars (PCFG) discriminate vandalism more effectively than shallow lexicosyntactic patterns based on n-grams. ,</p><p>5 0.69065171 <a title="298-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Better_Hypothesis_Testing_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation%3A_Controlling_for_Optimizer_Instability.html">60 acl-2011-Better Hypothesis Testing for Statistical Machine Translation: Controlling for Optimizer Instability</a></p>

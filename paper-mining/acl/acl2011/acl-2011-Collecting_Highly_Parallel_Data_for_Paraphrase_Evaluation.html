We propose an automatic method of extracting paraphrases from definition sentences, which are also automatically acquired from the Web. We observe that a huge number of concepts are defined in Web documents, and that the sentences that define the same concept tend to convey mostly the same information using different expressions and thus contain many paraphrases. We show that a large number of paraphrases can be automatically extracted with high precision by regarding the sentences that define the same concept as parallel corpora.

<p>Author: Yashar Mehdad ; Matteo Negri ; Marcello Federico</p><p>Abstract: This paper explores the use of bilingual parallel corpora as a source of lexical knowledge for cross-lingual textual entailment. We claim that, in spite of the inherent difficulties of the task, phrase tables extracted from parallel data allow to capture both lexical relations between single words, and contextual information useful for inference. We experiment with a phrasal matching method in order to: i) build a system portable across languages, and ii) evaluate the contribution of lexical knowledge in isolation, without interaction with other inference mechanisms. Results achieved on an English-Spanish corpus obtained from the RTE3 dataset support our claim, with an overall accuracy above average scores reported by RTE participants on monolingual data. Finally, we show that using parallel corpora to extract paraphrase tables reveals their potential also in the monolingual setting, improving the results achieved with other sources of lexical knowledge.</p><p>6 0.27520984 <a title="72-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Translating_from_Morphologically_Complex_Languages%3A_A_Paraphrase-Based_Approach.html">310 acl-2011-Translating from Morphologically Complex Languages: A Paraphrase-Based Approach</a></p>

<p>Author: Preslav Nakov ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach to translating from a morphologically complex language. Unlike previous research, which has targeted word inflections and concatenations, we focus on the pairwise relationship between morphologically related words, which we treat as potential paraphrases and handle using paraphrasing techniques at the word, phrase, and sentence level. An important advantage of this framework is that it can cope with derivational morphology, which has so far remained largely beyond the capabilities of statistical machine translation systems. Our experiments translating from Malay, whose morphology is mostly derivational, into English show signif- icant improvements over rivaling approaches based on five automatic evaluation measures (for 320,000 sentence pairs; 9.5 million English word tokens).</p><p>6 0.65339595 <a title="72-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Using_Bilingual_Parallel_Corpora_for_Cross-Lingual_Textual_Entailment.html">327 acl-2011-Using Bilingual Parallel Corpora for Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment</a></p>

<p>Author: Fei Liu ; Fuliang Weng ; Bingqing Wang ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: Most text message normalization approaches are based on supervised learning and rely on human labeled training data. In addition, the nonstandard words are often categorized into different types and specific models are designed to tackle each type. In this paper, we propose a unified letter transformation approach that requires neither pre-categorization nor human supervision. Our approach models the generation process from the dictionary words to nonstandard tokens under a sequence labeling framework, where each letter in the dictionary word can be retained, removed, or substituted by other letters/digits. To avoid the expensive and time consuming hand labeling process, we automatically collected a large set of noisy training pairs using a novel webbased approach and performed character-level . alignment for model training. Experiments on both Twitter and SMS messages show that our system significantly outperformed the stateof-the-art deletion-based abbreviation system and the jazzy spell checker (absolute accuracy gain of 21.69% and 18. 16% over jazzy spell checker on the two test sets respectively).</p><p>same-paper 2 0.7543059 <a title="72-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Collecting_Highly_Parallel_Data_for_Paraphrase_Evaluation.html">72 acl-2011-Collecting Highly Parallel Data for Paraphrase Evaluation</a></p>

Chinese sentence segmentation is viewed as the detection of loosely coordinated clauses separated by commas. Trained and tested on data derived from the Chinese Treebank, our model achieves a classification accuracy of close to 90% overall, which translates to an F1 score of 70% for detecting commas that signal sentence boundaries.</p><p>4 0.68678582 <a title="72-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Automatically_Evaluating_Text_Coherence_Using_Discourse_Relations.html">53 acl-2011-Automatically Evaluating Text Coherence Using Discourse Relations</a></p>
<p>Author: Ziheng Lin ; Hwee Tou Ng ; Min-Yen Kan</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel model to represent and assess the discourse coherence of text. Our model assumes that coherent text implicitly favors certain types of discourse relation transitions. We implement this model and apply it towards the text ordering ranking task, which aims to discern an original text from a permuted ordering of its sentences. The experimental results demonstrate that our model is able to significantly outperform the state-ofthe-art coherence model by Barzilay and Lapata (2005), reducing the error rate of the previous approach by an average of 29% over three data sets against human upperbounds. We further show that our model is synergistic with the previous approach, demonstrating an error reduction of 73% when the features from both models are combined for the task.</p><p>5 0.67243254 <a title="72-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Joint_Annotation_of_Search_Queries.html">182 acl-2011-Joint Annotation of Search Queries</a></p>

As previous research shows, these differences severely limit the applicability of Marking up search queries with linguistic annotations such as part-of-speech tags, capitalization, and segmentation, is an impor- tant part of query processing and understanding in information retrieval systems. Due to their brevity and idiosyncratic structure, search queries pose a challenge to existing NLP tools. To address this challenge, we propose a probabilistic approach for performing joint query annotation. First, we derive a robust set of unsupervised independent annotations, using queries and pseudo-relevance feedback. Then, we stack additional classifiers on the independent annotations, and exploit the dependencies between them to further improve the accuracy, even with a very limited amount of available training data. We evaluate our method using a range of queries extracted from a web search log. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our approach for both short keyword queries, and verbose natural language queries.</p><p>6 0.66580975 <a title="72-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Machine_Translation_System_Combination_by_Confusion_Forest.html">217 acl-2011-Machine Translation System Combination by Confusion Forest</a></p>

</p><p>3 We identify 20 categories of common-sense knowledge that are prevalent in textual entailment, many of which have received scarce attention from researchers building collections of knowledge. [sent-7, score-0.665]
</p><p>4 1 Introduction It is generally accepted that knowledge about how the world works, or common-sense knowledge, is vital for natural language understanding. [sent-8, score-0.369]
</p><p>5 There is, however, much less agreement or understanding about how to define common-sense knowledge, and  what its components are (Feldman, 2002). [sent-9, score-0.086]
</p><p>6 Existing large-scale knowledge repositories, like Cyc (Guha and Lenat, 1990), OpenMind (Stork, 1999), and Freebase1 , have steadily gathered together impressive collections of common-sense knowledge, but no one yet believes that this job is done. [sent-10, score-0.271]
</p><p>7 Other databases focus on exhaustively cataloging a specific kind of knowledge e. [sent-11, score-0.255]
</p><p>8 Likewise, most knowledge extraction systems focus on extracting one specific kind of knowledge from text, often factual relationships (Banko et al. [sent-14, score-0.498]

</p><p>10 What kinds of knowledge might lie outside the collections that the community has focused on building? [sent-20, score-0.411]
</p><p>11 With the help of five annotators, we have investigated the RTE-5 corpus to determine the types of knowledge involved in human judgments of RTE. [sent-24, score-0.312]
</p><p>12 We found 20 distinct categories of commonsense knowledge that featured prominently in RTE, besides linguistic knowledge, hyponymy, and synonymy. [sent-25, score-0.493]
</p><p>13 Inter-annotator agreement statistics indicate that these categories are well-defined. [sent-26, score-0.314]
</p><p>14 Many of the categories fall outside ofthe realm ofall but the most general knowledge bases, like Cyc, and differ from the standard relational knowledge that most automated knowledge extraction techniques try to find. [sent-27, score-0.964]
</p><p>15 Section 3 presents the categories of world knowledge that we found were most prominent in the data. [sent-29, score-0.8]

</p><p>18 First, we manually selected a set of RTE data that could not be solved using linguistic knowledge and WordNet alone. [sent-37, score-0.217]
</p><p>19 We then sketched stepby-step inferences needed to show ENTAILMENT or CONTRADICTION of the hypothesis. [sent-38, score-0.065]
</p><p>20 We identified prominent categories of world knowledge in-  volved in these inferences, and asked five annotators to label the knowledge with the different categories. [sent-39, score-1.137]
</p><p>21 We judge the well-definedness of the categories by inter-annotator agreement, and their relative importance according to frequency in the data. [sent-40, score-0.276]
</p><p>22 Many synonymy and hypernymy databases already exist, and although coreference decisions may themselves depend on world knowledge, it is difficult to separate the contribution of world knowledge from the contribution of linguistic cues for coreference. [sent-45, score-0.665]
</p><p>23 Some sample phenomena that we explicitly chose to disregard include: knowledge of syntactic variations, verb tenses, apposition, and abbreviations. [sent-46, score-0.217]
</p><p>24 For each of the 108 pairs in our data, we created  proofs, or a step-by-step sketch of the inferences that lead to a decision about entailment ofthe hypothesis. [sent-48, score-0.234]
</p><p>25 Each line in the proof indicates either a new piece of background knowledge brought to bear, or a modus ponens inference from the information in the text or previous lines of the proof. [sent-50, score-0.271]
</p><p>26 Note that the proofs may not be the only way of reasoning from the text to an entailment decision about the hypothesis, and that alternative proofs might require different kinds of common-sense knowledge. [sent-52, score-0.751]
</p><p>27 We created 20 categories to classify the 221 diverse statements of world knowledge in our proofs. [sent-54, score-0.795]
</p><p>28 , “Canberra is part of Australia” could be in the Geography category or the part of category). [sent-58, score-0.248]
</p><p>29 In cases where we foresaw the overlaps, we manually specified which  category should take precedence; in the above example, we gave precedence to the Geography category, so that statements of this kind would all be included under Geography. [sent-59, score-0.447]
</p><p>30 This approach has the drawback of biasing somewhat the frequencies in our data set towards the categories that take precedence. [sent-60, score-0.276]
</p><p>31 We evaluate our categorization to determine how well-defined and understandable the categories are. [sent-62, score-0.276]
</p><p>32 The 20 categories were explained using fabricated examples (not part of the survey data). [sent-64, score-0.393]
</p><p>33 Annotators kept these fabricated examples as references during the survey. [sent-65, score-0.067]
</p><p>34 Each annotator labeled each of the pieces of world knowledge from the proofs using one of the 20 categories. [sent-66, score-0.68]
</p><p>35 From this data we calculate Fleiss’s κ for inter-annotator agreement3 in order to measure how well-defined the categories are. [sent-67, score-0.276]
</p><p>36 We compute κ once over all ques2The RTE pairs, proofs, and category judgments from study are available at  our  http://www. [sent-68, score-0.292]
</p><p>37 Separately, we also compute κ once for each category C, by treating all annotations for categories C0 C as the same. [sent-77, score-0.524]
</p><p>38 =  3  Categories of Knowledge  By manual inspection, we arrived at the following 20 prominent categories of world knowledge in our subset of the RTE-5 data. [sent-78, score-0.8]
</p><p>39 For each category, we give a brief definition and example, along with the ID of an RTE pair whose proof includes the example. [sent-79, score-0.1]
</p><p>40 Our categories can be loosely organized into form-based categories and content-based categories. [sent-80, score-0.552]
</p><p>41 1 Form-based Categories The following categories are defined by how the knowledge can be described in a representation language, such as logic. [sent-83, score-0.493]
</p><p>42 Cause and Effect: Statements in this category require that a predicate p holds true after an event or  action A. [sent-85, score-0.451]
</p><p>43 #542: Once a person is welcomed into an organization, they belong to that organization. [sent-86, score-0.059]
</p><p>44 Preconditions: For a given action or event A at time t, a precondition p is a predicate that must hold true of the world before time t, in order for A to have taken place. [sent-88, score-0.355]
</p><p>45 Simultaneous Conditions: Knowledge in this category indicates that a predicate p must hold true at the same time as an event or second predicate p0. [sent-91, score-0.452]
</p><p>46 #240: When a person is an employee of an organization, that organization pays his or her salary. [sent-92, score-0.11]
</p><p>47 Argument Types: Knowledge in this category specifies the types or selectional preferences for arguments to a relationship. [sent-94, score-0.369]
</p><p>48 #311: The type of thing that adopts children is the type person. [sent-95, score-0.079]
</p><p>49 Prominent Relationship: Texts often specify that there exists some relationship between two entities, without specifying which relationship. [sent-97, score-0.098]
</p><p>50 Knowledge in this category specifies which relationship is most likely, given the types of the entities involved. [sent-98, score-0.487]
</p><p>51 #42: If a painter is related to a painting somehow 331 (e. [sent-99, score-0.16]
</p><p>52 , “da Vinci’s Mona Lisa”), the painter most likely painted the painting. [sent-101, score-0.168]
</p><p>53 #493: fatherOf is functional a person can have only one father. [sent-109, score-0.113]
</p><p>54 Mutual Exclusivity: Related to functionality, mutual exclusivity knowledge indicates types of things that do not participate in the same relationship. [sent-111, score-0.637]
</p><p>55 Thus, because Putin supports the United Russia party, and the United Russia party supports Medvedev, we can infer that Putin supports Medvedev. [sent-116, score-0.241]
</p><p>56 2 Content-based Categories The following categories are defined by the content, topic, or domain of the knowledge in them. [sent-118, score-0.493]
</p><p>57 Geography: This includes knowledge such as “Australia is a place,” “Sydney is in Australia,” and “Canberra is the capital of Australia. [sent-122, score-0.263]
</p><p>58 Public Entities: This category is for well-known properties of highly-recognizable named-entities. [sent-124, score-0.248]
</p><p>59 Cultural/Situational: This category includes knowledge of or shared by a particular culture. [sent-127, score-0.511]
</p><p>60 is member of: Statements of this category indicate that an entity belongs to a larger organization. [sent-130, score-0.304]
</p><p>61 has parts: This category expresses what components an object or situation is comprised of. [sent-133, score-0.248]
</p><p>62 Support/Opposition: This includes knowledge of the kinds of actions or relationships toward X that  indicate positive or negative feeling toward X. [sent-136, score-0.397]
</p><p>63 Accountability: This includes any knowledge that is helpful for determining who or what is responsible for an action or event. [sent-138, score-0.355]
</p><p>64 Synecdoche: Synecdoche is knowledge that a person or thing can represent or speak for an organization or structure he or she is a part of. [sent-141, score-0.364]
</p><p>65 Knowledge in this category indicates that these separate pieces of evidence can combine in a probabilistic, noisy-or fashion to increase confidence in a particular inference. [sent-146, score-0.303]
</p><p>66 #437: Stocks on the “Nikkei 225” exchange and Toyota’s stock both fell, which independently suggest that Japan’s economy might be struggling, but in combination they are stronger evidence that  Japan’s economy is floundering. [sent-147, score-0.09]
</p><p>67 Omniscience: Certain RTE judgments are only possible if we assume that the text includes all information pertinent to the story, so that we may discredit statements that were not mentioned. [sent-149, score-0.24]
</p><p>68 4  Results and Discussion  Our headline result is that the above twenty categories overall are well-defined, with a Fleiss’s κ score of 0. [sent-153, score-0.276]
</p><p>69 678, and that they cover the vast majority of the world knowledge used in our proofs. [sent-154, score-0.369]
</p><p>70 This has important implications, as it suggests that concentrating on collecting these kinds of world knowledge will make a large difference to RTE, and hopefully to language understanding in general. [sent-155, score-0.487]

</p><p>73 support/opposition will be familiar to NLP researchers from resources like WordNet, gazetteers, and text mining projects for extracting causal knowledge, properties of named entities, and opinions. [sent-218, score-0.061]
</p><p>74 Yet these familiar categories make up only about 40% of the world knowledge used in our proofs. [sent-219, score-0.706]
</p><p>75 Common knowledge types, like definitional knowledge, arithmetic, and accountability, have for the most part been ignored by research on automated knowledge collection. [sent-220, score-0.434]
</p><p>76 Others have only earned very scarce and recent attention, like preconditions (Sil et al. [sent-221, score-0.13]
</p><p>77 We continue to believe that these are well-defined categories, and suspect that —  further studies with better training of the annotators will support this. [sent-225, score-0.155]
</p><p>78 One issue during annotation was that certain pieces of knowledge could be labeled as a content category or a form category, and instructions may not have been clear enough on which is appropriate under these circumstances. [sent-226, score-0.52]
</p><p>79 Nevertheless, considering the number of annotators and the uneven distribution of data points across the categories (both of which tend to decrease κ), κ scores are overall quite high. [sent-227, score-0.396]
</p><p>80 In an effort to discover if some of the categories overlap enough to justify combining them into a single category, we tried combining categories which annotators frequently confused with one another. [sent-228, score-0.705]
</p><p>81 As an example of a merge that failed, we tried merging Argument Types and Mutual Exclusivity, with the idea that if a system knows about the selectional preferences of different relationships, it should be able to deduce which relationships or types are mutually exclusive. [sent-230, score-0.22]
</p><p>82 However, the κ score for this combined category was 0. [sent-231, score-0.248]
</p><p>83 ” The knowledge in the first case is more properly described as, “If there exists an unspecified relationship R between a painter and a painting, then R is the relationship ‘painted’ . [sent-240, score-0.514]
</p><p>84 ” In the second case, the knowledge is more properly described as, “If x participates in the relationship ‘adopts children’, then x is of type ‘person’ . [sent-241, score-0.315]
</p><p>85 ” Stated in this way, these kinds of knowledge look quite different. [sent-242, score-0.287]
</p><p>86 If one reads our proofs from start to finish, the flow of the argument indicates which of these forms is intended, but for annotators quickly reading through the proofs, the two kinds of knowledge can look superficially very similar, and the annotators can become confused. [sent-243, score-0.867]
</p><p>87 333  The best category combination that we discovered is a combination of Functionality and Mutual Exclusivity (combined κ of 0. [sent-244, score-0.248]
</p><p>88 Functional relationships R imply that if x and x0 have different values y and y0, then x and x0 must be distinct, or mutually exclusive. [sent-249, score-0.099]
</p><p>89 We intended that Mutual Exclusivity apply to sets rather than individual items, but annotators apparently had trouble distinguishing between the two categories, so in future we may wish to revise our set of categories. [sent-250, score-0.158]
</p><p>90 The 20 categories of knowledge covered 215 (97%) of the 221 statements of world knowledge in our proofs. [sent-252, score-1.012]
</p><p>91 Of the remaining 6 statements, two were from recognizable categories, like knowledge for temporal reasoning (#355) and an application of the frame axiom (#265). [sent-253, score-0.276]
</p><p>92 We left these out of the survey to cut down on the number of categories that annotators had to learn. [sent-254, score-0.446]
</p><p>93 The remaining four statements were difficult to categorize at all. [sent-255, score-0.15]
</p><p>94 For instance, #177: “Motorcycle manufacturers often sponsor  teams in motorcycle sports. [sent-256, score-0.067]
</p><p>95 ” The other three ofthese difficult-to-categorize statements came from proofs for #265, #336, and #432. [sent-257, score-0.406]
</p><p>96 We suspect that if future studies analyze more data for common-sense knowledge types, more categories will emerge as important, and more facts that lie outside of recognizable categories will also appear. [sent-258, score-0.933]
</p><p>97 Fortunately, however, it appears that at least a very large fraction ofcommonsense knowledge can be captured by the sets of categories we describe here. [sent-259, score-0.493]
</p><p>98 Thus these categories serve to point out promising areas for further research in collecting common-sense knowledge. [sent-260, score-0.276]

<p>Author: Eyal Shnarch ; Jacob Goldberger ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing entailment at the lexical level is an important and commonly-addressed component in textual inference. Yet, this task has been mostly approached by simplified heuristic methods. This paper proposes an initial probabilistic modeling framework for lexical entailment, with suitable EM-based parameter estimation. Our model considers prominent entailment factors, including differences in lexical-resources reliability and the impacts of transitivity and multiple evidence. Evaluations show that the proposed model outperforms most prior systems while pointing at required future improvements. 1 Introduction and Background Textual Entailment was proposed as a generic paradigm for applied semantic inference (Dagan et al., 2006). This task requires deciding whether a tex- tual statement (termed the hypothesis-H) can be inferred (entailed) from another text (termed the textT). Since it was first introduced, the six rounds of the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) challenges1 , currently organized under NIST, have become a standard benchmark for entailment systems. These systems tackle their complex task at various levels of inference, including logical representation (Tatu and Moldovan, 2007; MacCartney and Manning, 2007), semantic analysis (Burchardt et al., 2007) and syntactic parsing (Bar-Haim et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009). Inference at these levels usually 1http://www.nist.gov/tac/2010/RTE/index.html 558 requires substantial processing and resources (e.g. parsing) aiming at high performance. Nevertheless, simple entailment methods, performing at the lexical level, provide strong baselines which most systems did not outperform (Mirkin et al., 2009; Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010). Within complex systems, lexical entailment modeling is an important component. Finally, there are cases in which a full system cannot be used (e.g. lacking a parser for a targeted language) and one must resort to the simpler lexical approach. While lexical entailment methods are widely used, most of them apply ad hoc heuristics which do not rely on a principled underlying framework. Typically, such methods quantify the degree of lexical coverage of the hypothesis terms by the text’s terms. Coverage is determined either by a direct match of identical terms in T and H or by utilizing lexical semantic resources, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), that capture lexical entailment relations (denoted here as entailment rules). Common heuristics for quantifying the degree of coverage are setting a threshold on the percentage coverage of H’s terms (Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010), counting absolute number of uncovered terms (Clark and Harrison, 2010), or applying an Information Retrievalstyle vector space similarity score (MacKinlay and Baldwin, 2009). Other works (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005; Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006) have applied a heuristic formula to estimate the similarity between text fragments based on a similarity function between their terms. These heuristics do not capture several important aspects of entailment, such as varying reliability of Proceedings ofP thoer t4l9atnhd A, Onrnuegaoln M,e Jeuntineg 19 o-f2 t4h,e 2 A0s1s1o.c?i ac t2io0n11 fo Ar Cssoocmiaptuiotanti foonra Clo Lminpguutiast i ocns:aslh Loirntpgaupisetrics , pages 558–563, entailment resources and the impact of rule chaining and multiple evidence on entailment likelihood. An additional observation from these and other systems is that their performance improves only moderately when utilizing lexical resources2. We believe that the textual entailment field would benefit from more principled models for various entailment phenomena. Inspired by the earlier steps in the evolution of Statistical Machine Translation methods (such as the initial IBM models (Brown et al., 1993)), we formulate a concrete generative probabilistic modeling framework that captures the basic aspects of lexical entailment. Parameter estimation is addressed by an EM-based approach, which enables estimating the hidden lexical-level entailment parameters from entailment annotations which are available only at the sentence-level. While heuristic methods are limited in their ability to wisely integrate indications for entailment, probabilistic methods have the advantage of being extendable and enabling the utilization of wellfounded probabilistic methods such as the EM algorithm. We compared the performance of several model variations to previously published results on RTE data sets, as well as to our own implementation of typical lexical baselines. Results show that both the probabilistic model and our percentagecoverage baseline perform favorably relative to prior art. These results support the viability of the probabilistic framework while pointing at certain modeling aspects that need to be improved. 2 Probabilistic Model Under the lexical entailment scope, our modeling goal is obtaining a probabilistic score for the likelihood that all H’s terms are entailed by T. To that end, we model prominent aspects of lexical entailment, which were mostly neglected by previous lexical methods: (1) distinguishing different reliability levels of lexical resources; (2) allowing transitive chains of rule applications and considering their length when estimating their validity; and (3) considering multiple entailments when entailing a term. 2See ablation tests reports in http://aclweb.org/aclwiki/ index.php?title=RTE Knowledge Resources#Ablation Tests 559 Figure 1: The generative process of entailing terms of a hypothesis from a text. Edges represent entailment rules. There are 3 evidences for the entailment of hi :a rule from Resource1 , another one from Resource3 both suggesting that tj entails it, and a chain from t1through an intermediate term t0. 2.1 Model Description For T to entail H it is usually a necessary, but not sufficient, that every term h ∈ H would be entsauiflefidci by ,at t hleatast e one t teerrmm mt h ∈ ∈T (Glickman eet al., 2006). Figure s1t odneescr tiebrmes tth ∈e process komf entailing hypothesis terms. The trivial case is when identical terms, possibly at the stem or lemma level, appear in T and H (a direct match as tn and hm in Figure 1). Alternatively, we can establish entailment based on knowledge of entailing lexical-semantic relations, such as synonyms, hypernyms and morphological derivations, available in lexical resources (e.g the rule inference → reasoning from WordNet). (We.eg d theneo rutel by R(r) cthee → resource nwgh ficroh provided teht)e. rule r. Since entailment is a transitive relation, rules may compose transitive chains that connect a term t ∈ T ctoo a pteosrme rha ∈ Hive through hinatte cromnendeicatte a tteerrmms. t ∈Fo Tr instance, fr hom ∈ t hHe r thurleosu infer → inference armnds inference → reasoning we can dre →duc inef tehreen rcuele a infer → reasoning (were inference dise dthuec ein thteerm rueldeia intef trer →m as t0 in Figure 1). Multiple chains may connect t to h (as for tj and hi in Figure 1) or connect several terms in T to h (as t1 and tj are indicating the entailment of hi in Figure 1), thus providing multiple evidence for h’s entailment. It is reasonable to expect that if a term t indeed entails a term h, it is likely to find evidences for this relation in several resources. Taking a probabilistic perspective, we assume a parameter θR for each resource R, denoting its reliability, i.e. the prior probability that applying a rule from R corresponds to a valid entailment instance. Direct matches are considered as a special “resource”, called MATCH, for which θMATCH is expected to be close to 1. We now present our probabilistic model. For a text term t ∈ T to entail a hypothesis term h by a tcehxatin te c, mde tn ∈ote Td by etn →tcai h, thhyep application mof h every r ∈ c must be valid.

The probability that T does not entail h at all (by any chain), specified in Eq. 2, is the probability that all these chains are not valid. Finally, the probability that T entails all of H, assuming independence of H’s terms, is the probability that every h ∈ H is entailed, as given ien p Eq. a3b. Nityot tihceat t ehvaet yth here ∈ c oHul ids be a term h which is not covered by any available rule chain. Under this formulation, we assume that each such h is covered by a single rule coming from a special “resource” called UNCOVERED (expecting θUNCOVERED to be relatively small). p(t −→c h) = Yp(lhs →r rhs) = Yr∈c p(T 9 h) = Y YθR(r)(1) Yr∈c [1 − p(t− →c h)] (2) c∈YC(h) p(T → H) = Y p(T → h) (3) hY∈H As can be seen, our model indeed distinguishes varying resource reliability, decreases entailment probability as rule chains grow and increases it when entailment of a term is supported by multiple chains. The above treatment of uncovered terms in H, as captured in Eq. 3, assumes that their entailment probability is independent of the rest of the hypothesis. However, when the number of covered hypothesis terms increases the probability that the remaining terms are actually entailed by T increases too 560 (even though we do not have supporting knowledge for their entailment). Thus, an alternative model is to group all uncovered terms together and estimate the overall probability of their joint entailment as a function of the lexical coverage of the hypothesis. We denote Hc as the subset of H’s terms which are covered by some rule chain and Huc as the remaining uncovered part. Eq. 3a then provides a refined entailment model for H, in which the second term specifies the probability that Huc is entailed given that Hc is validly entailed and the corresponding lengths: p(T→H) = [Yp(T→h)]·p(T→Huc hY∈Hc 2.2 | |Hc|,|H|) (3a) Parameter Estimation The difficulty in estimating the θR values is that these are term-level parameters while the RTEtraining entailment annotation is given for the sentence-level. Therefore, we use EM-based estimation for the hidden parameters (Dempster et al., 1977). In the E step we use the current θR values to compute all whcr (T, H) values for each training pair. whcr (T, H) stands for the posterior probability that application of the rule r in the chain c for h ∈ H tish valid, given nth oaft heieth reurl eT r e innta thiles c Hha or not ra hcc ∈ord Hing to the training annotation (see Eq. 4). Remember that a rule r provides an entailment relation between its left-hand-side (lhs) and its right-hand-side (rhs). Therefore Eq. 4 uses the notation lhs →r rhs to designate the application of the rule r (similar htos Eq. 1). wEhc:r(T,H)=   p (lTh9→sH−→ |rlhsrp−→ rh(Tsr→9|hTsH )9→p(lhHs−→ r) =hs)if(4T)9→H After applying Bayes’ rule we get a fraction with Eq. 3 in its denominator and θR(r) as the second term of the numerator. The first numerator term is defined as in Eq. 3 except that for the corresponding rule application we substitute θR(r) by 1(per the conditioning event). The probabilistic model defined by Eq. 1-3 is a loop-free directed acyclic graphical model (aka a Bayesian network). Hence the E-step probabilities can be efficiently calculated using the belief propagation algorithm (Pearl, 1988). The M step uses Eq. 5 to update the parameter set. For each resource R we average the whcr (T, H) val- ues for all its rule applications in the training, whose total number is denoted nR.

In this task participants should find all sentences that entail a given hypothesis in a given document cluster. This task’s data sets reflect a natural distribution of entailments in a corpus and demonstrate a more realistic scenario than the previous RTE challenges. In our system, sentences are tokenized and stripped of stop words and terms are lemmatized and tagged for part-of-speech. As lexical resources we use WordNet (WN) (Fellbaum, 1998), taking as entailment rules synonyms, derivations, hyponyms and meronyms of the first senses of T and H terms, and the CatVar (Categorial Variation) database (Habash and Dorr, 2003). We allow rule chains of length up to 4 in WordNet (WN4). We compare our model to two types of baselines: (1) RTE published results: the average of the best runs of all systems, the best and second best performing lexical systems and the best full system of each challenge; (2) our implementation of lexical 561 coverage model, tuning the percentage-of-coverage threshold for entailment on the training set. This model uses the same configuration as ourprobabilistic model. We also implemented an Information Re- trieval style baseline3 (both with and without lexical expansions), but given its poorer performance we omit its results here. Table 1 presents the results. We can see that both our implemented models (probabilistic and coverage) outperform all RTE lexical baselines on both data sets, apart from (Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010) which incorporates additional lexical resources, a named entity recognizer and a co-reference system. On RTE-5, the probabilistic model is comparable in performance to the best full system, while the coverage model achieves considerably better results. We notice that our implemented models successfully utilize resources to increase performance, as opposed to typical smaller or less consistent improvements in prior works (see Section 1).

In particular, WN4 performs better than the single-step WN only on RTE-5, suggesting the need to improve the modeling of chain- ing. The fluctuations over the data sets and impacts of resources suggest the need for further investigation over additional data sets and resources. As for the coverage model, under our configuration it poses a bigger challenge for RTE systems than perviously reported baselines. It is thus proposed as an easy to implement baseline for future entailment research. 4 Conclusions and Future Work This paper presented, for the first time, a principled and relatively rich probabilistic model for lexical entailment, amenable for estimation of hidden lexicallevel parameters from standard sentence-level annotations. The positive results of the probabilistic model compared to prior art and its ability to exploit lexical resources indicate its future potential. Yet, further investigation is needed. For example, analyzing current model’s limitations, we observed that the multiplicative nature of eqs. 1and 3 (reflecting independence assumptions) is too restrictive, resembling a logical AND. Accordingly we plan to explore relaxing this strict conjunctive behavior through models such as noisy-AND (Pearl, 1988). We also intend to explore the contribution of our model, and particularly its estimated parameter values, within a complex system that integrates multiple levels of inference.

<p>Author: Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan ; Jacob Goldberger</p><p>Abstract: Extensive knowledge bases ofentailment rules between predicates are crucial for applied semantic inference. In this paper we propose an algorithm that utilizes transitivity constraints to learn a globally-optimal set of entailment rules for typed predicates. We model the task as a graph learning problem and suggest methods that scale the algorithm to larger graphs. We apply the algorithm over a large data set of extracted predicate instances, from which a resource of typed entailment rules has been recently released (Schoenmackers et al., 2010). Our results show that using global transitivity information substantially improves performance over this resource and several baselines, and that our scaling methods allow us to increase the scope of global learning of entailment-rule graphs.</p><p>4 0.12610257 <a title="315-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Using_Bilingual_Parallel_Corpora_for_Cross-Lingual_Textual_Entailment.html">327 acl-2011-Using Bilingual Parallel Corpora for Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment</a></p>

We claim that, in spite of the inherent difficulties of the task, phrase tables extracted from parallel data allow to capture both lexical relations between single words, and contextual information useful for inference. We experiment with a phrasal matching method in order to: i) build a system portable across languages, and ii) evaluate the contribution of lexical knowledge in isolation, without interaction with other inference mechanisms. Results achieved on an English-Spanish corpus obtained from the RTE3 dataset support our claim, with an overall accuracy above average scores reported by RTE participants on monolingual data. Finally, we show that using parallel corpora to extract paraphrase tables reveals their potential also in the monolingual setting, improving the results achieved with other sources of lexical knowledge.</p><p>5 0.094008632 <a title="315-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Relation_Guided_Bootstrapping_of_Semantic_Lexicons.html">262 acl-2011-Relation Guided Bootstrapping of Semantic Lexicons</a></p>

<p>Author: Eyal Shnarch ; Jacob Goldberger ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing entailment at the lexical level is an important and commonly-addressed component in textual inference. Yet, this task has been mostly approached by simplified heuristic methods. This paper proposes an initial probabilistic modeling framework for lexical entailment, with suitable EM-based parameter estimation. Our model considers prominent entailment factors, including differences in lexical-resources reliability and the impacts of transitivity and multiple evidence. Evaluations show that the proposed model outperforms most prior systems while pointing at required future improvements. 1 Introduction and Background Textual Entailment was proposed as a generic paradigm for applied semantic inference (Dagan et al., 2006). This task requires deciding whether a tex- tual statement (termed the hypothesis-H) can be inferred (entailed) from another text (termed the textT). Since it was first introduced, the six rounds of the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) challenges1 , currently organized under NIST, have become a standard benchmark for entailment systems. These systems tackle their complex task at various levels of inference, including logical representation (Tatu and Moldovan, 2007; MacCartney and Manning, 2007), semantic analysis (Burchardt et al., 2007) and syntactic parsing (Bar-Haim et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009). Inference at these levels usually 1http://www.nist.gov/tac/2010/RTE/index.html 558 requires substantial processing and resources (e.g. parsing) aiming at high performance. Nevertheless, simple entailment methods, performing at the lexical level, provide strong baselines which most systems did not outperform (Mirkin et al., 2009; Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010). Within complex systems, lexical entailment modeling is an important component. Finally, there are cases in which a full system cannot be used (e.g. lacking a parser for a targeted language) and one must resort to the simpler lexical approach. While lexical entailment methods are widely used, most of them apply ad hoc heuristics which do not rely on a principled underlying framework. Typically, such methods quantify the degree of lexical coverage of the hypothesis terms by the text’s terms. Coverage is determined either by a direct match of identical terms in T and H or by utilizing lexical semantic resources, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), that capture lexical entailment relations (denoted here as entailment rules). Common heuristics for quantifying the degree of coverage are setting a threshold on the percentage coverage of H’s terms (Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010), counting absolute number of uncovered terms (Clark and Harrison, 2010), or applying an Information Retrievalstyle vector space similarity score (MacKinlay and Baldwin, 2009). Other works (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005; Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006) have applied a heuristic formula to estimate the similarity between text fragments based on a similarity function between their terms. These heuristics do not capture several important aspects of entailment, such as varying reliability of Proceedings ofP thoer t4l9atnhd A, Onrnuegaoln M,e Jeuntineg 19 o-f2 t4h,e 2 A0s1s1o.c?i ac t2io0n11 fo Ar Cssoocmiaptuiotanti foonra Clo Lminpguutiast i ocns:aslh Loirntpgaupisetrics , pages 558–563, entailment resources and the impact of rule chaining and multiple evidence on entailment likelihood. An additional observation from these and other systems is that their performance improves only moderately when utilizing lexical resources2. We believe that the textual entailment field would benefit from more principled models for various entailment phenomena. Inspired by the earlier steps in the evolution of Statistical Machine Translation methods (such as the initial IBM models (Brown et al., 1993)), we formulate a concrete generative probabilistic modeling framework that captures the basic aspects of lexical entailment. Parameter estimation is addressed by an EM-based approach, which enables estimating the hidden lexical-level entailment parameters from entailment annotations which are available only at the sentence-level. While heuristic methods are limited in their ability to wisely integrate indications for entailment, probabilistic methods have the advantage of being extendable and enabling the utilization of wellfounded probabilistic methods such as the EM algorithm. We compared the performance of several model variations to previously published results on RTE data sets, as well as to our own implementation of typical lexical baselines. Results show that both the probabilistic model and our percentagecoverage baseline perform favorably relative to prior art. These results support the viability of the probabilistic framework while pointing at certain modeling aspects that need to be improved. 2 Probabilistic Model Under the lexical entailment scope, our modeling goal is obtaining a probabilistic score for the likelihood that all H’s terms are entailed by T. To that end, we model prominent aspects of lexical entailment, which were mostly neglected by previous lexical methods: (1) distinguishing different reliability levels of lexical resources; (2) allowing transitive chains of rule applications and considering their length when estimating their validity; and (3) considering multiple entailments when entailing a term. 2See ablation tests reports in http://aclweb.org/aclwiki/ index.php?title=RTE Knowledge Resources#Ablation Tests 559 Figure 1: The generative process of entailing terms of a hypothesis from a text. Edges represent entailment rules. There are 3 evidences for the entailment of hi :a rule from Resource1 , another one from Resource3 both suggesting that tj entails it, and a chain from t1through an intermediate term t0. 2.1 Model Description For T to entail H it is usually a necessary, but not sufficient, that every term h ∈ H would be entsauiflefidci by ,at t hleatast e one t teerrmm mt h ∈ ∈T (Glickman eet al., 2006). Figure s1t odneescr tiebrmes tth ∈e process komf entailing hypothesis terms. The trivial case is when identical terms, possibly at the stem or lemma level, appear in T and H (a direct match as tn and hm in Figure 1). Alternatively, we can establish entailment based on knowledge of entailing lexical-semantic relations, such as synonyms, hypernyms and morphological derivations, available in lexical resources (e.g the rule inference → reasoning from WordNet). (We.eg d theneo rutel by R(r) cthee → resource nwgh ficroh provided teht)e. rule r. Since entailment is a transitive relation, rules may compose transitive chains that connect a term t ∈ T ctoo a pteosrme rha ∈ Hive through hinatte cromnendeicatte a tteerrmms. t ∈Fo Tr instance, fr hom ∈ t hHe r thurleosu infer → inference armnds inference → reasoning we can dre →duc inef tehreen rcuele a infer → reasoning (were inference dise dthuec ein thteerm rueldeia intef trer →m as t0 in Figure 1). Multiple chains may connect t to h (as for tj and hi in Figure 1) or connect several terms in T to h (as t1 and tj are indicating the entailment of hi in Figure 1), thus providing multiple evidence for h’s entailment. It is reasonable to expect that if a term t indeed entails a term h, it is likely to find evidences for this relation in several resources. Taking a probabilistic perspective, we assume a parameter θR for each resource R, denoting its reliability, i.e. the prior probability that applying a rule from R corresponds to a valid entailment instance. Direct matches are considered as a special “resource”, called MATCH, for which θMATCH is expected to be close to 1. We now present our probabilistic model. For a text term t ∈ T to entail a hypothesis term h by a tcehxatin te c, mde tn ∈ote Td by etn →tcai h, thhyep application mof h every r ∈ c must be valid.

The probability that T does not entail h at all (by any chain), specified in Eq. 2, is the probability that all these chains are not valid. Finally, the probability that T entails all of H, assuming independence of H’s terms, is the probability that every h ∈ H is entailed, as given ien p Eq. a3b. Nityot tihceat t ehvaet yth here ∈ c oHul ids be a term h which is not covered by any available rule chain. Under this formulation, we assume that each such h is covered by a single rule coming from a special “resource” called UNCOVERED (expecting θUNCOVERED to be relatively small). p(t −→c h) = Yp(lhs →r rhs) = Yr∈c p(T 9 h) = Y YθR(r)(1) Yr∈c [1 − p(t− →c h)] (2) c∈YC(h) p(T → H) = Y p(T → h) (3) hY∈H As can be seen, our model indeed distinguishes varying resource reliability, decreases entailment probability as rule chains grow and increases it when entailment of a term is supported by multiple chains. The above treatment of uncovered terms in H, as captured in Eq. 3, assumes that their entailment probability is independent of the rest of the hypothesis. However, when the number of covered hypothesis terms increases the probability that the remaining terms are actually entailed by T increases too 560 (even though we do not have supporting knowledge for their entailment). Thus, an alternative model is to group all uncovered terms together and estimate the overall probability of their joint entailment as a function of the lexical coverage of the hypothesis. We denote Hc as the subset of H’s terms which are covered by some rule chain and Huc as the remaining uncovered part. Eq. 3a then provides a refined entailment model for H, in which the second term specifies the probability that Huc is entailed given that Hc is validly entailed and the corresponding lengths: p(T→H) = [Yp(T→h)]·p(T→Huc hY∈Hc 2.2 | |Hc|,|H|) (3a) Parameter Estimation The difficulty in estimating the θR values is that these are term-level parameters while the RTEtraining entailment annotation is given for the sentence-level. Therefore, we use EM-based estimation for the hidden parameters (Dempster et al., 1977). In the E step we use the current θR values to compute all whcr (T, H) values for each training pair. whcr (T, H) stands for the posterior probability that application of the rule r in the chain c for h ∈ H tish valid, given nth oaft heieth reurl eT r e innta thiles c Hha or not ra hcc ∈ord Hing to the training annotation (see Eq. 4). Remember that a rule r provides an entailment relation between its left-hand-side (lhs) and its right-hand-side (rhs). Therefore Eq. 4 uses the notation lhs →r rhs to designate the application of the rule r (similar htos Eq. 1). wEhc:r(T,H)=   p (lTh9→sH−→ |rlhsrp−→ rh(Tsr→9|hTsH )9→p(lhHs−→ r) =hs)if(4T)9→H After applying Bayes’ rule we get a fraction with Eq. 3 in its denominator and θR(r) as the second term of the numerator. The first numerator term is defined as in Eq. 3 except that for the corresponding rule application we substitute θR(r) by 1(per the conditioning event). The probabilistic model defined by Eq. 1-3 is a loop-free directed acyclic graphical model (aka a Bayesian network). Hence the E-step probabilities can be efficiently calculated using the belief propagation algorithm (Pearl, 1988). The M step uses Eq. 5 to update the parameter set. For each resource R we average the whcr (T, H) val- ues for all its rule applications in the training, whose total number is denoted nR.

We also tried initializing the EM algorithm with these direct estimations but did not obtain performance improvements. 3 Evaluations and Results The 5th Recognizing Textual Entailment challenge (RTE-5) introduced a new search task (Bentivogli et al., 2009) which became the main task in RTE6 (Bentivogli et al., 2010). In this task participants should find all sentences that entail a given hypothesis in a given document cluster. This task’s data sets reflect a natural distribution of entailments in a corpus and demonstrate a more realistic scenario than the previous RTE challenges. In our system, sentences are tokenized and stripped of stop words and terms are lemmatized and tagged for part-of-speech. As lexical resources we use WordNet (WN) (Fellbaum, 1998), taking as entailment rules synonyms, derivations, hyponyms and meronyms of the first senses of T and H terms, and the CatVar (Categorial Variation) database (Habash and Dorr, 2003). We allow rule chains of length up to 4 in WordNet (WN4). We compare our model to two types of baselines: (1) RTE published results: the average of the best runs of all systems, the best and second best performing lexical systems and the best full system of each challenge; (2) our implementation of lexical 561 coverage model, tuning the percentage-of-coverage threshold for entailment on the training set. This model uses the same configuration as ourprobabilistic model. We also implemented an Information Re- trieval style baseline3 (both with and without lexical expansions), but given its poorer performance we omit its results here. Table 1 presents the results. We can see that both our implemented models (probabilistic and coverage) outperform all RTE lexical baselines on both data sets, apart from (Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010) which incorporates additional lexical resources, a named entity recognizer and a co-reference system. On RTE-5, the probabilistic model is comparable in performance to the best full system, while the coverage model achieves considerably better results. We notice that our implemented models successfully utilize resources to increase performance, as opposed to typical smaller or less consistent improvements in prior works (see Section 1).

In particular, WN4 performs better than the single-step WN only on RTE-5, suggesting the need to improve the modeling of chain- ing. The fluctuations over the data sets and impacts of resources suggest the need for further investigation over additional data sets and resources. As for the coverage model, under our configuration it poses a bigger challenge for RTE systems than perviously reported baselines. It is thus proposed as an easy to implement baseline for future entailment research. 4 Conclusions and Future Work This paper presented, for the first time, a principled and relatively rich probabilistic model for lexical entailment, amenable for estimation of hidden lexicallevel parameters from standard sentence-level annotations. The positive results of the probabilistic model compared to prior art and its ability to exploit lexical resources indicate its future potential. Yet, further investigation is needed. For example, analyzing current model’s limitations, we observed that the multiplicative nature of eqs. 1and 3 (reflecting independence assumptions) is too restrictive, resembling a logical AND. Accordingly we plan to explore relaxing this strict conjunctive behavior through models such as noisy-AND (Pearl, 1988). We also intend to explore the contribution of our model, and particularly its estimated parameter values, within a complex system that integrates multiple levels of inference.

<p>Author: Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan ; Jacob Goldberger</p><p>Abstract: Extensive knowledge bases ofentailment rules between predicates are crucial for applied semantic inference. In this paper we propose an algorithm that utilizes transitivity constraints to learn a globally-optimal set of entailment rules for typed predicates. We model the task as a graph learning problem and suggest methods that scale the algorithm to larger graphs. We apply the algorithm over a large data set of extracted predicate instances, from which a resource of typed entailment rules has been recently released (Schoenmackers et al., 2010). Our results show that using global transitivity information substantially improves performance over this resource and several baselines, and that our scaling methods allow us to increase the scope of global learning of entailment-rule graphs.</p><p>4 0.5577265 <a title="315-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Using_Bilingual_Parallel_Corpora_for_Cross-Lingual_Textual_Entailment.html">327 acl-2011-Using Bilingual Parallel Corpora for Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment</a></p>
<p>Author: Yashar Mehdad ; Matteo Negri ; Marcello Federico</p><p>Abstract: This paper explores the use of bilingual parallel corpora as a source of lexical knowledge for cross-lingual textual entailment. We claim that, in spite of the inherent difficulties of the task, phrase tables extracted from parallel data allow to capture both lexical relations between single words, and contextual information useful for inference. We experiment with a phrasal matching method in order to: i) build a system portable across languages, and ii) evaluate the contribution of lexical knowledge in isolation, without interaction with other inference mechanisms. Results achieved on an English-Spanish corpus obtained from the RTE3 dataset support our claim, with an overall accuracy above average scores reported by RTE participants on monolingual data. Finally, we show that using parallel corpora to extract paraphrase tables reveals their potential also in the monolingual setting, improving the results achieved with other sources of lexical knowledge.</p><p>5 0.50365406 <a title="315-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-NULEX%3A_An_Open-License_Broad_Coverage_Lexicon.html">229 acl-2011-NULEX: An Open-License Broad Coverage Lexicon</a></p>
<p>Author: Clifton McFate ; Kenneth Forbus</p><p>Abstract: Broad coverage lexicons for the English language have traditionally been handmade. This approach, while accurate, requires too much human labor. Furthermore, resources contain gaps in coverage, contain specific types of information, or are incompatible with other resources. We believe that the state of open-license technology is such that a comprehensive syntactic lexicon can be automatically compiled. This paper describes the creation of such a lexicon, NU-LEX, an open-license feature-based lexicon for general purpose parsing that combines WordNet, VerbNet, and Wiktionary and contains over 100,000 words. NU-LEX was integrated into a bottom up chart parser. We ran the parser through three sets of sentences, 50 sentences total, from the Simple English Wikipedia and compared its performance to the same parser using Comlex. Both parsers performed almost equally with NU-LEX finding all lex-items for 50% of the sentences and Comlex succeeding for 52%. Furthermore, NULEX’s shortcomings primarily fell into two categories, suggesting future research directions. 1</p><p>6 0.44193631 <a title="315-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Insights_from_Network_Structure_for_Text_Mining.html">174 acl-2011-Insights from Network Structure for Text Mining</a></p>

Inspired by the observation that pressing backspace is one of the most common user behaviors to modify the errors, we collect 54, 309, 334 error-correction pairs from a realworld data set that contains 2, 277, 786 users via backspace operations. In addition, we present a comparative analysis of the data to achieve a better understanding of users’ input behaviors. Comparisons with English typos suggest that some language-specific properties result in a part of Chinese input errors. 1</p><p>4 0.62999332 <a title="315-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-A_Discriminative_Model_for_Joint_Morphological_Disambiguation_and_Dependency_Parsing.html">10 acl-2011-A Discriminative Model for Joint Morphological Disambiguation and Dependency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: John Lee ; Jason Naradowsky ; David A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: Most previous studies of morphological disambiguation and dependency parsing have been pursued independently. Morphological taggers operate on n-grams and do not take into account syntactic relations; parsers use the “pipeline” approach, assuming that morphological information has been separately obtained. However, in morphologically-rich languages, there is often considerable interaction between morphology and syntax, such that neither can be disambiguated without the other. In this paper, we propose a discriminative model that jointly infers morphological properties and syntactic structures. In evaluations on various highly-inflected languages, this joint model outperforms both a baseline tagger in morphological disambiguation, and a pipeline parser in head selection.</p><p>5 0.54495573 <a title="315-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-A_Hierarchical_Model_of_Web_Summaries.html">14 acl-2011-A Hierarchical Model of Web Summaries</a></p>
<p>Author: Yves Petinot ; Kathleen McKeown ; Kapil Thadani</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the relevance of hierarchical topic models to represent the content of Web gists. We focus our attention on DMOZ, a popular Web directory, and propose two algorithms to infer such a model from its manually-curated hierarchy of categories. Our first approach, based on information-theoretic grounds, uses an algorithm similar to recursive feature selection. Our second approach is fully Bayesian and derived from the more general model, hierarchical LDA. We evaluate the performance of both models against a flat 1-gram baseline and show improvements in terms of perplexity over held-out data.</p><p>6 0.47108856 <a title="315-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Identification_of_Domain-Specific_Senses_in_a_Machine-Readable_Dictionary.html">158 acl-2011-Identification of Domain-Specific Senses in a Machine-Readable Dictionary</a></p>

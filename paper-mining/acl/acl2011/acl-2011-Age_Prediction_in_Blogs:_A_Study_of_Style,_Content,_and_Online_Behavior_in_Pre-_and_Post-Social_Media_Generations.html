<p>Author: Apoorv Agarwal</p><p>Abstract: In my thesis, Ipropose to build a system that would enable extraction of social interactions from texts. To date Ihave defined a comprehensive set of social events and built a preliminary system that extracts social events from news articles. Iplan to improve the performance of my current system by incorporating semantic information. Using domain adaptation techniques, Ipropose to apply my system to a wide range of genres. By extracting linguistic constructs relevant to social interactions, I will be able to empirically analyze different kinds of linguistic constructs that people use to express social interactions.

<p>Author: Marjorie Freedman ; Alex Baron ; Vasin Punyakanok ; Ralph Weischedel</p><p>Abstract: For 20 years, information extraction has focused on facts expressed in text. In contrast, this paper is a snapshot of research in progress on inferring properties and relationships among participants in dialogs, even though these properties/relationships need not be expressed as facts. For instance, can a machine detect that someone is attempting to persuade another to action or to change beliefs or is asserting their credibility? We report results on both English and Arabic discussion forums. 1</p><p>4 0.14262989 <a title="31-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Towards_Style_Transformation_from_Written-Style_to_Audio-Style.html">306 acl-2011-Towards Style Transformation from Written-Style to Audio-Style</a></p>
<p>Author: Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Barbara Rosario ; Kent Lyons</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of optimizing the style of textual content to make it more suitable to being listened to by a user as opposed to being read. We study the differences between the written style and the audio style by consulting the linguistics andjour- nalism literatures. Guided by this study, we suggest a number of linguistic features to distinguish between the two styles. We show the correctness of our features and the impact of style transformation on the user experience through statistical analysis, a style classification task, and a user study.</p><p>5 0.14038268 <a title="31-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Creating_a_manually_error-tagged_and_shallow-parsed_learner_corpus.html">88 acl-2011-Creating a manually error-tagged and shallow-parsed learner corpus</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryo Nagata ; Edward Whittaker ; Vera Sheinman</p><p>Abstract: The availability of learner corpora, especially those which have been manually error-tagged or shallow-parsed, is still limited. This means that researchers do not have a common development and test set for natural language processing of learner English such as for grammatical error detection. Given this background, we created a novel learner corpus that was manually error-tagged and shallowparsed. This corpus is available for research and educational purposes on the web. In this paper, we describe it in detail together with its data-collection method and annotation schemes. Another contribution of this paper is that we take the first step toward evaluating the performance of existing POStagging/chunking techniques on learner corpora using the created corpus. These contributions will facilitate further research in related areas such as grammatical error detection and automated essay scoring.</p><p>6 0.12148797 <a title="31-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Interactive_Group_Suggesting_for_Twitter.html">177 acl-2011-Interactive Group Suggesting for Twitter</a></p>

<p>Author: Philip Bramsen ; Martha Escobar-Molano ; Ami Patel ; Rafael Alonso</p><p>Abstract: Sociolinguists have long argued that social context influences language use in all manner of ways, resulting in lects 1. This paper explores a text classification problem we will call lect modeling, an example of what has been termed computational sociolinguistics. In particular, we use machine learning techniques to identify social power relationships between members of a social network, based purely on the content of their interpersonal communication. We rely on statistical methods, as opposed to language-specific engineering, to extract features which represent vocabulary and grammar usage indicative of social power lect. We then apply support vector machines to model the social power lects representing superior-subordinate communication in the Enron email corpus. Our results validate the treatment of lect modeling as a text classification problem – albeit a hard one – and constitute a case for future research in computational sociolinguistics. 1</p><p>4 0.64351672 <a title="31-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Language_Use%3A_What_can_it_tell_us%3F.html">194 acl-2011-Language Use: What can it tell us?</a></p>

<p>Author: Jui-Yu Weng ; Cheng-Lun Yang ; Bo-Nian Chen ; Yen-Kai Wang ; Shou-De Lin</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a system to summarize a Microblog post and its responses with the goal to provide readers a more constructive and concise set of information for efficient digestion. We introduce a novel two-phase summarization scheme. In the first phase, the post plus its responses are classified into four categories based on the intention, interrogation, sharing, discussion and chat. For each type of post, in the second phase, we exploit different strategies, including opinion analysis, response pair identification, and response relevancy detection, to summarize and highlight critical information to display. This system provides an alternative thinking about machinesummarization: by utilizing AI approaches, computers are capable of constructing deeper and more user-friendly abstraction. 1</p><p>6 0.61848414 <a title="31-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Towards_Style_Transformation_from_Written-Style_to_Audio-Style.html">306 acl-2011-Towards Style Transformation from Written-Style to Audio-Style</a></p>

<p>Author: Barbara Plank ; Gertjan van Noord</p><p>Abstract: It is well known that parsing accuracy suffers when a model is applied to out-of-domain data. It is also known that the most beneficial data to parse a given domain is data that matches the domain (Sekine, 1997; Gildea, 2001). Hence, an important task is to select appropriate domains. However, most previous work on domain adaptation relied on the implicit assumption that domains are somehow given. As more and more data becomes available, automatic ways to select data that is beneficial for a new (unknown) target domain are becoming attractive. This paper evaluates various ways to automatically acquire related training data for a given test set. The results show that an unsupervised technique based on topic models is effective – it outperforms random data selection on both languages exam- ined, English and Dutch. Moreover, the technique works better than manually assigned labels gathered from meta-data that is available for English. 1 Introduction and Motivation Previous research on domain adaptation has focused on the task of adapting a system trained on one domain, say newspaper text, to a particular new domain, say biomedical data. Usually, some amount of (labeled or unlabeled) data from the new domain was given which has been determined by a human. However, with the growth of the web, more and more data is becoming available, where each document “is potentially its own domain” (McClosky et al., 2010). It is not straightforward to determine – 1566 Gertjan van Noord University of Groningen The Netherlands G J M van Noord@ rug nl . . . . . which data or model (in case we have several source domain models) will perform best on a new (unknown) target domain. Therefore, an important issue that arises is how to measure domain similarity, i.e. whether we can find a simple yet effective method to determine which model or data is most beneficial for an arbitrary piece of new text. Moreover, if we had such a measure, a related question is whether it can tell us something more about what is actually meant by “domain”. So far, it was mostly arbitrarily used to refer to some kind of coherent unit (related to topic, style or genre), e.g.: newspaper text, biomedical abstracts, questions, fiction. Most previous work on domain adaptation, for instance Hara et al. (2005), McClosky et al. (2006), Blitzer et al. (2006), Daum e´ III (2007), sidestepped this problem of automatic domain selection and adaptation. For parsing, to our knowledge only one recent study has started to examine this issue (McClosky et al., 2010) we will discuss their approach in Section 2. Rather, an implicit assumption of all of these studies is that domains are given, i.e. that they are represented by the respective corpora. Thus, a corpus has been considered a homogeneous unit. As more data is becoming available, it is unlikely that – domains will be ‘given’ . Moreover, a given corpus might not always be as homogeneous as originally thought (Webber, 2009; Lippincott et al., 2010). For instance, recent work has shown that the well-known Penn Treebank (PT) Wall Street Journal (WSJ) actually contains a variety of genres, including letters, wit and short verse (Webber, 2009). In this study we take a different approach. Rather than viewing a given corpus as a monolithic entity, ProceedingPso orftla thned 4,9 Otrhe Agonnn,u Jauln Mee 1e9t-i2ng4, o 2f0 t1h1e. A ?c s 2o0ci1a1ti Aonss foocria Ctioomnp fourta Ctioomnaplu Ltaintigouniaslti Lcisn,g puaigsetsic 1s566–1576, we break it down to the article-level and disregard corpora boundaries. Given the resulting set of documents (articles), we evaluate various ways to automatically acquire related training data for a given test set, to find answers to the following questions: • Given a pool of data (a collection of articles fGriovmen nun ak pnooowln o domains) caonldle a test article, eiss there a way to automatically select data that is relevant for the new domain? If so: • Which similarity measure is good for parsing? • How does it compare to human-annotated data? • Is the measure also useful for other languages Iasnd th/oer mtaesakssu?r To this end, we evaluate measures of domain similarity and feature representations and their impact on dependency parsing accuracy. Given a collection of annotated articles, and a new article that we want to parse, we want to select the most similar articles to train the best parser for that new article. In the following, we will first compare automatic measures to human-annotated labels by examining parsing performance within subdomains of the Penn Treebank WSJ. Then, we extend the experiments to the domain adaptation scenario. Experiments were performed on two languages: English and Dutch. The empirical results show that a simple measure based on topic distributions is effective for both languages and works well also for Part-of-Speech tagging. As the approach is based on plain surfacelevel information (words) and it finds related data in a completely unsupervised fashion, it can be easily applied to other tasks or languages for which annotated (or automatically annotated) data is available. 2 Related Work The work most related to ours is McClosky et al. (2010). They try to find the best combination of source models to parse data from a new domain, which is related to Plank and Sima’an (2008). In the latter, unlabeled data was used to create several parsers by weighting trees in the WSJ according to their similarity to the subdomain. McClosky et al. (2010) coined the term multiple source domain adaptation. Inspired by work on parsing accuracy 1567 prediction (Ravi et al., 2008), they train a linear regression model to predict the best (linear interpolation) of source domain models. Similar to us, McClosky et al. (2010) regard a target domain as mixture of source domains, but they focus on phrasestructure parsing. Furthermore, our approach differs from theirs in two respects: we do not treat source corpora as one entity and try to mix models, but rather consider articles as base units and try to find subsets of related articles (the most similar articles); moreover, instead of creating a supervised model (in their case to predict parsing accuracy), our approach is ‘simplistic’ : we apply measures of domain simi- larity directly (in an unsupervised fashion), without the necessity to train a supervised model. Two other related studies are (Lippincott et al., 2010; Van Asch and Daelemans, 2010). Van Asch and Daelemans (2010) explore a measure of domain difference (Renyi divergence) between pairs of domains and its correlation to Part-of-Speech tagging accuracy. Their empirical results show a linear correlation between the measure and the performance loss. Their goal is different, but related: rather than finding related data for a new domain, they want to estimate the loss in accuracy of a PoS tagger when applied to a new domain. We will briefly discuss results obtained with the Renyi divergence in Section 5.1. Lippincott et al. (2010) examine subdomain variation in biomedicine corpora and propose awareness of NLP tools to such variation. However, they did not yet evaluate the effect on a practical task, thus our study is somewhat complementary to theirs. The issue of data selection has recently been examined for Language Modeling (Moore and Lewis, 2010). A subset of the available data is automatically selected as training data for a Language Model based on a scoring mechanism that compares cross- entropy scores. Their approach considerably outperformed random selection and two previous proposed approaches both based on perplexity scoring.1 3 Measures of Domain Similarity 3.1 Measuring Similarity Automatically Feature Representations A similarity function may be defined over any set of events that are con1We tested data selection by perplexity scoring, but found the Language Models too small to be useful in our setting. sidered to be relevant for the task at hand. For parsing, these might be words, characters, n-grams (of words or characters), Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags, bilexical dependencies, syntactic rules, etc. However, to obtain more abstract types such as PoS tags or dependency relations, one would first need to gather respective labels. The necessary tools for this are again trained on particular corpora, and will suffer from domain shifts, rendering labels noisy. Therefore, we want to gauge the effect of the simplest representation possible: plain surface characteristics (unlabeled text). This has the advantage that we do not need to rely on additional supervised tools; moreover, it is interesting to know how far we can get with this level of information only. We examine the following feature representations: relative frequencies of words, relative frequencies of character tetragrams, and topic models. Our motivation was as follows. Relative frequencies of words are a simple and effective representation used e.g. in text classification (Manning and Sch u¨tze, 1999), while character n-grams have proven successful in genre classification (Wu et al., 2010). Topic models (Blei et al., 2003; Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007) can be considered an advanced model over word distributions: every article is represented by a topic distribution, which in turn is a distribution over words. Similarity between documents can be measured by comparing topic distributions. Similarity Functions There are many possible similarity (or distance) functions. They fall broadly into two categories: probabilistically-motivated and geometrically-motivated functions. The similarity functions examined in this study will be described in the following. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence D(q| |r) is a cTlahsesic Kaull measure oibfl ‘edri s(KtaLn)ce d’i2v ebregtweneceen D Dtw(oq probability distributions, and is defined as: D(q| |r) = Pyq(y)logrq((yy)). It is a non-negative, additive, aPsymmetric measure, and 0 iff the two distributions are identical. However, the KL-divergence is undefined if there exists an event y such that q(y) > 0 but r(y) = 0, which is a property that “makes it unsuitable for distributions derived via maximumlikelihood estimates” (Lee, 2001). 2It is not a proper distance metric since it is asymmetric. 1568 One option to overcome this limitation is to apply smoothing techniques to gather non-zero estimates for all y. The alternative, examined in this paper, is to consider an approximation to the KL divergence, such as the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence (Lin, 1991) and the skew divergence (Lee, 2001). The Jensen-Shannon divergence, which is symmetric, computes the KL-divergence between q, r, and the average between the two. We use the JS divergence as defined in Lee (2001): JS(q, r) = [D(q| |avg(q, r)) + D(r| |avg(q, r))] . The asymm[eDtr(icq |s|akvewg( divergence sα, proposed by Lee (2001), mixes one distribution with the other by a degree de- 21 fined by α ∈ [0, 1) : sα (q, r, α) = D(q| |αr + (1 α)q). Ays α α approaches 1, rt,hαe )sk =ew D divergence approximates the KL-divergence. An alternative way to measure similarity is to consider the distributions as vectors and apply geometrically-motivated distance functions. This family of similarity functions includes the cosine cos(q, r) = qq(y) · r(y)/ | |q(y) | | | |r(y) | |, euclidean − euc(q,r) = qPy(q(y) − r(y))2 and variational (also known asq LP1 or MPanhattan) distance function, defined as var(q, r) = Py |q(y) − r(y) |. 3.2 Human-annotatePd data In contrast to the automatic measures devised in the previous section, we might have access to human annotated data. That is, use label information such as topic or genre to define the set of similar articles. Genre For the Penn Treebank (PT) Wall Street Journal (WSJ) section, more specifically, the subset available in the Penn Discourse Treebank, there exists a partition of the data by genre (Webber, 2009). Every article is assigned one of the following genre labels: news, letters, highlights, essays, errata, wit and short verse, quarterly progress reports, notable and quotable. This classification has been made on the basis of meta-data (Webber, 2009). It is wellknown that there is no meta-data directly associated with the individual WSJ files in the Penn Treebank. However, meta-data can be obtained by looking at the articles in the ACL/DCI corpus (LDC99T42), and a mapping file that aligns document numbers of DCI (DOCNO) to WSJ keys (Webber, 2009). An example document is given in Figure 1. The metadata field HL contains headlines, SO source info, and the IN field includes topic markers.</p><p>4 0.73173213 <a title="31-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Goodness%3A_A_Method_for_Measuring_Machine_Translation_Confidence.html">146 acl-2011-Goodness: A Method for Measuring Machine Translation Confidence</a></p>
<p>Author: Nguyen Bach ; Fei Huang ; Yaser Al-Onaizan</p><p>Abstract: State-of-the-art statistical machine translation (MT) systems have made significant progress towards producing user-acceptable translation output. However, there is still no efficient way for MT systems to inform users which words are likely translated correctly and how confident it is about the whole sentence. We propose a novel framework to predict wordlevel and sentence-level MT errors with a large number of novel features. Experimental results show that the MT error prediction accuracy is increased from 69.1 to 72.2 in F-score. The Pearson correlation between the proposed confidence measure and the human-targeted translation edit rate (HTER) is 0.6. Improve- ments between 0.4 and 0.9 TER reduction are obtained with the n-best list reranking task using the proposed confidence measure. Also, we present a visualization prototype of MT errors at the word and sentence levels with the objective to improve post-editor productivity.</p><p>5 0.70260155 <a title="31-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Social_Network_Extraction_from_Texts%3A_A_Thesis_Proposal.html">286 acl-2011-Social Network Extraction from Texts: A Thesis Proposal</a></p>

To date Ihave defined a comprehensive set of social events and built a preliminary system that extracts social events from news articles. Iplan to improve the performance of my current system by incorporating semantic information. Using domain adaptation techniques, Ipropose to apply my system to a wide range of genres. By extracting linguistic constructs relevant to social interactions, I will be able to empirically analyze different kinds of linguistic constructs that people use to express social interactions. Lastly, I will attempt to make convolution kernels more scalable and interpretable.</p><p>6 0.70244831 <a title="31-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-IMASS%3A_An_Intelligent_Microblog_Analysis_and_Summarization_System.html">156 acl-2011-IMASS: An Intelligent Microblog Analysis and Summarization System</a></p>

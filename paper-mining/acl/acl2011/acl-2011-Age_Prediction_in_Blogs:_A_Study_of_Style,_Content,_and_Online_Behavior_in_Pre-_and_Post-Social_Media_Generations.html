</p><p>4 We also show that internet writing characteristics are important features for age prediction, but that lexical content is also needed to produce significantly more  accurate results. [sent-6, score-0.802]
</p><p>5 The introduction of instant messaging, forums, social networking and blogs has made it possible for people of every age to become authors. [sent-10, score-1.142]
</p><p>6 The users of these social media platforms have created their own form of unstructured writing that is best characterized as informal. [sent-11, score-0.374]
</p><p>7 This problem is called age prediction and raises two main questions: •  •  Is there a point in time that proves to be a significantly bte itnter ti dividing plinroev ebset twoee bne pre and post-social media generations? [sent-16, score-0.875]
</p><p>8 We focus on this generation due to the rise of popular social media technologies such as messaging and online social networks sites that occurred during that time. [sent-19, score-0.753]
</p><p>9 Therefore, we experimented with binary classification into age groups using all birth dates from 1975 through 1988, thus including students from generation Y who were in college during the emergence of social media technologies. [sent-20, score-1.421]
</p><p>10 The appearance of social media technologies such as AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) , weblogs, SMS text messaging, Facebook and MySpace occurred when people with these birth dates were in college. [sent-22, score-0.699]

</p><p>12 We examine lexical-content features such as collocations and part-of-speech collocations, lexical-stylistic features such as internet slang and capitalization, and features representing online behavior such as time of post and number of friends. [sent-28, score-0.524]
</p><p>13 We find that both stylistic and content features have a significant impact on age prediction and show that, for unseen blogs, we are able to classify authors as born before or after 1979 with 80% accuracy and born before or after 1984 with 82%  accuracy. [sent-29, score-1.0]
</p><p>14 In the remainder of this paper, we first discuss work to date on age prediction for blogs and then present the features that we extracted, which is a larger set than previously explored. [sent-30, score-0.943]
</p><p>15 In the second, we show how the accuracy of age prediction changes over time and pinpoint when major changes occur. [sent-33, score-0.777]
</p><p>16 In the last experiment, we describe our age prediction experiments in more detail for the most significant years. [sent-34, score-0.651]
</p><p>17 2  Related Work  In previous work, Mackinnon (2006) , used LiveJournal data to identify a blogger’s age by examining the mean age of his peer group using his social network and not just his immediate friends. [sent-35, score-1.438]
</p><p>18 They were able to predict the correct age within +/-5 years at 98% accuracy. [sent-36, score-0.728]
</p><p>19 This approach, however, is very different from ours as it requires access to the age of each of the blogger’s friends. [sent-37, score-0.613]
</p><p>20 Our approach uses only a body of text  written by a person along with his blogging behavior to determine which age group he is more closely identified with. [sent-38, score-0.874]
</p><p>21 Initial research on predicting age without using the ages of friends focuses on identifying important candidate features, including blogging characteristics (e. [sent-39, score-0.747]
</p><p>22 They aimed at binary prediction of age, classifying LiveJournal bloggers as either over or under 764 18, but were unable to automatically predict age with more accuracy than a baseline model that always chose the majority class. [sent-46, score-1.013]
</p><p>23 In our study on determining the ideal age split we did not find 18 (bloggers born in 1986 in their dataset) to be significant. [sent-47, score-0.701]
</p><p>24 (2006) has examined metadata such as gender and age in blogger. [sent-49, score-0.685]
</p><p>25 In contrast to our work, they examine bloggers based on their age at the time of the experiment, whether in the 10’s, 20’s or 30’s age bracket. [sent-51, score-1.551]
</p><p>26 They identify interesting  changes in content and style features across categories, in which they include blogging words (e. [sent-52, score-0.283]
</p><p>27 They can distinguish between bloggers in the 10’s and in the 30’s with relatively high accuracy (above 96%) but many 30s are misclassified as 20s, which results in a overall accuracy of 76. [sent-59, score-0.37]
</p><p>28 Their work shows that ease of classification is dependent in part on what division is made between age groups and in turn motivates our decision to study whether the creation of social media technologies can be used to find the dividing line(s) . [sent-64, score-1.082]
</p><p>29 In other work, Tam and Martell (2009) attempt to detect age in the NPS chat corpus between teens and other ages. [sent-72, score-0.712]
</p><p>30 They achieve > 90% accuracy when classifying teens vs 30s, 40s, 50s, and all adults and achieve at best 76% when using 3 character gram features in classifying teens vs 20s. [sent-74, score-0.356]
</p><p>31 This work shows that n-grams are useful features for detecting age and it is difficult to detect differences between consecutive groups such as teens and 20s, and this  Figure 1: Number of bloggers in 2010 by year of birth from 1950-1996. [sent-75, score-1.413]
</p><p>32 Other researchers have investigated weblogs for differences in writing style depending on gender identification (Herring and Paolillo, 2006; Yan and Yan, 2006; Nowson and Oberlander, 2006) . [sent-78, score-0.33]
</p><p>33 3  Data Collection  Our corpus consists of blogs downloaded from the virtual community LiveJournal. [sent-84, score-0.251]
</p><p>34 We chose to use LiveJournal blogs for our corpus because the website provides an easy-to-use format in XML for downloading and crawling their site. [sent-85, score-0.309]
</p><p>35 In addition, LiveJournal gives bloggers the opportunity to post their age on their profile. [sent-86, score-0.966]
</p><p>36 We take advantage of this feature by downloading blogs where the user chooses to publicly provide this metadata. [sent-87, score-0.28]
</p><p>37 We downloaded approximately 24,500 Live765 Journal blogs containing age. [sent-88, score-0.251]
</p><p>38 We represent age as the year a person was born and not his age at the time of the experiment. [sent-89, score-1.482]
</p><p>39 Since technology has different effects in different countries, we only analyze the blogs of people who have listed US as their country. [sent-90, score-0.3]
</p><p>40 Each blog was written by a unique individual and includes  a user profile and up to 25 recent posts written between 2000-2010 with the most recent post being written in 2009-2010. [sent-93, score-0.384]
</p><p>41 The birth dates of the bloggers range in years from 1940 to 2000 and thus, their age ranges from 10 to 70 in 2010. [sent-94, score-1.288]
</p><p>42 Figure 1 shows the number of bloggers per age in our group with birth dates from 1950 to 1996. [sent-95, score-1.241]
</p><p>43 The majority of bloggers on LiveJournal were born between 1978-1989. [sent-96, score-0.384]
</p><p>44 All of the features we used are explained in Table 1 along with their trend as age decreases where applica-  ble. [sent-101, score-0.689]
</p><p>45 These age groups are used solely to illustrate the differences that occur at different ages and are not used in our classification experiments. [sent-110, score-0.754]
</p><p>46 We then pruned the list of interests by excluding any interest that occurred within a +/-10 window (based on its position in the list) in multiple age groups. [sent-111, score-0.828]
</p><p>47 We show the top interests in each age group in Table 2. [sent-112, score-0.863]
</p><p>48 For example, “disney” is the most popular unique interest in the 18-22 age group with only 39 other non-unique interests in that age group occurring more frequently. [sent-113, score-1.555]
</p><p>49 “Fanfiction” is a popular interest in all age groups, but it is significantly more popular in the 18-22 age group than in other age groups. [sent-114, score-1.983]
</p><p>50 The number of lifetime posts (Figure 2(d)) , and posts decreases as bloggers get younger which is as one would expect unless younger people were orders of magnitude more prolific than older people. [sent-116, score-0.838]
</p><p>51 The mode time (Figure 2(b)) , refers to the most 766  The top half refers to the top 5 interests that are unique to each age group. [sent-117, score-0.901]
</p><p>52 We found time to not be a useful feature in this manner and it is difficult to come to any conclusions from its change as year of birth decreases. [sent-120, score-0.329]
</p><p>53 Other than sentence length, they were normalized by sentence and post to keep the  numbers consistent between bloggers regardless of whether the user wrote one or many posts in his/her blog. [sent-124, score-0.477]
</p><p>54 The number of emoticons (Figure 2(a)) , acronyms, and capital words increased as bloggers got younger. [sent-125, score-0.372]
</p><p>55 The length of sentences decreased as bloggers got younger and the number of links/images varied across all years as shown in Figure 2(c) . [sent-127, score-0.468]
</p><p>56 Due to the length of time it takes to run this program, we ran Xtract on 1500 random blogs from each age group and examined the first 1000 words per blog. [sent-135, score-0.961]
</p><p>57 We extracted the top 200 words and collocations sorted by post frequency (pf) , which is the number of posts the term occurred in. [sent-138, score-0.386]
</p><p>58 Then, similarly to interests, we pruned each list to include the features that did not occur within +/-10 window (based on its position in the list) within each age group. [sent-139, score-0.654]
</p><p>59 Prior to settling on these metrics, we also experimented with other metrics such as the number of times the collocation  half refers to the top 5 words that are unique to each age group. [sent-140, score-0.738]
</p><p>60 In addition, we also experimented with looking at a different number of important words and collocations ranging from the top 100-300 terms and experimented without pruning. [sent-142, score-0.235]
</p><p>61 Table 3 shows the top words for each age group; older people tend to use words such as “house” and “old” frequently and younger people talk about “school”. [sent-144, score-0.841]
</p><p>62 In our analysis of the top collocations, we found that younger people tend to use first person singular (I,me) in subject position while older people tend to use first person plural (we) in subject position, both with a variety of verbs. [sent-145, score-0.296]

</p><p>65 The experiment looks at three age groups containing a 5-year gap between each group. [sent-163, score-0.719]
</p><p>66 Intermediate years were not included to provide clear differentiation between the groups because many of the blogs have been active for several years and this will make it less common for a blogger to have posts that fall into two age groups (Schler et al. [sent-164, score-1.463]
</p><p>67 We did not use the same age groups as Schler et al. [sent-166, score-0.677]
</p><p>68 because very few blogs on LiveJournal, in 2010, are in the 13-17 age group. [sent-167, score-0.864]
</p><p>69 , 2004) show teens as the dominant age group in all blogs. [sent-169, score-0.78]
</p><p>70 6% of blogs are written by bloggers between the ages 13-18 whereas based on the current demographic statistics, in 20102 , only 6. [sent-174, score-0.653]
</p><p>71 96% of blogs are written by that age group and the number of bloggers in the 31-36 age group increased from 3. [sent-175, score-1.968]
</p><p>72 We chose the later age groups because this study is based on blogs updated in 2009-10 which is 5-6 years later and thus, the 13-17 age group is now 18-22 and so  on. [sent-178, score-1.753]
</p><p>73 2 Social Media and Generation Y In the first experiment we used the current age  of a blogger based on when he wrote his last post. [sent-194, score-0.772]
</p><p>74 However, the age of a person changes; someone who was in one age group now will be in a different age group in 5 years. [sent-195, score-2.009]
</p><p>75 Furthermore, a blogger’s posts can fall into two categories depending on his age at the time. [sent-196, score-0.737]
</p><p>76 Therefore, our second experiment looks at year of birth instead of age, as that never changes. [sent-197, score-0.342]
</p><p>77 ’s experiment, our division does not introduce a gap between age groups, we do binary classification, and we use significantly less data. [sent-199, score-0.613]
</p><p>78 We were motivated to examine these years due to the emergence of social media technologies during that time. [sent-201, score-0.441]
</p><p>79 Furthermore, research by Pew Internet (Zickuhr, 2010) has found that this generation (defined as 19771992 in their research) uses social networking, blogs, and instant messaging more than their elders. [sent-202, score-0.314]
</p><p>80 The experiment is balanced to ensure that each birth year is evenly represented. [sent-203, score-0.342]
</p><p>81 We balance the data by choosing a blogger consecutively from each birth year in the category, repeating these sweeps through the category until we have obtained 1500 blogs. [sent-204, score-0.417]
</p><p>82 We chose to use 1500 blogs from each group because of processing power, time constraints, and the amount of blogs needed to reasonably sample the age group at each split. [sent-205, score-1.309]
</p><p>83 We found accuracy to increase as year of birth increases in various feature experiments which is consistent with the trends we found while examining the distribution of features such as emoticons and lifetime posts in Figure 2. [sent-207, score-0.601]
</p><p>84 We experimented with style and content features and found that both help improve accuracy. [sent-208, score-0.24]
</p><p>85 Figure 3 shows that content helps more than style, but style helps more as age decreases. [sent-209, score-0.767]
</p><p>86 We found 5 years to have significant improvement over all prior years for p ≤ . [sent-211, score-0.23]
</p><p>87 Generation Y 19 is considered the social media generation, so we decided to examine how the creation and/or popularity of social media technologies compared to the years that had a change in writing style. [sent-213, score-0.815]
</p><p>88 We looked at many popular social media technologies such as weblogs, messaging, and social networking sites. [sent-214, score-0.559]
</p><p>89 Figure 5 compares the significant years 1977,1979, and 1982-1984 against when each technology was created or became popular amongst college aged students. [sent-215, score-0.268]
</p><p>90 On the other hand, web forums and Twitter each coincide with only one outlying year which suggests that either they had less of an impact on writing style or, in the case of Twitter, the change has not yet been transferred to other writing forms. [sent-220, score-0.412]
</p><p>91 3  A Closer Look: 1979 and 1984  Our final experiment provides a more detailed explanation of the results using various feature combinations when splitting pre- and post- social media bloggers by year of birth at two of the significant years found in the previous section; 1979 and 1984. [sent-222, score-1.052]
</p><p>92 This indicates that our classification method could work well on blogs from any website. [sent-242, score-0.29]
</p><p>93 It is interesting to note that collocations and POS-collocations were useful, but only when we use 1984 as the split which implies that bloggers born in 1984 and later are more homogeneous. [sent-243, score-0.502]
</p><p>94 6  Conclusion and Future Work  We have shown that it is possible to predict the age group of a person based on style, content, and online behavior features with good accuracy; these are all features that are available  771  in any blog. [sent-244, score-0.915]
</p><p>95 While features representing writing practices that emerged with social media (e. [sent-245, score-0.415]
</p><p>96 , capitalized words, abbreviations, slang) do not significantly impact age prediction on their own, these features have a clear change of value across time, with post-social media bloggers using them more often. [sent-247, score-1.143]
</p><p>97 We found that the birth years that had a significant change in writing style corresponded to the birth dates of college-aged students at the time of the creation/popularity of social media technologies, AIM, SMS text messaging, weblogs, Facebook and MySpace. [sent-248, score-1.12]
</p><p>98 In the future we plan on using age and other metadata to improve results in larger tasks such as identifying opinion, persuasion and power by targeting our approach in those tasks to the identified age of the person. [sent-249, score-1.226]
</p><p>99 Another approach that we will experiment with is the use of ranking, regression, and/or clustering to create meaningful age groups. [sent-250, score-0.655]

<p>Author: Sara Rosenthal ; Kathleen McKeown</p><p>Abstract: We investigate whether wording, stylistic choices, and online behavior can be used to predict the age category of blog authors. Our hypothesis is that significant changes in writing style distinguish pre-social media bloggers from post-social media bloggers. Through experimentation with a range of years, we found that the birth dates of students in college at the time when social media such as AIM, SMS text messaging, MySpace and Facebook first became popular, enable accurate age prediction. We also show that internet writing characteristics are important features for age prediction, but that lexical content is also needed to produce significantly more accurate results. Our best results allow for 81.57% accuracy.</p><p>2 0.16416244 <a title="31-tfidf-2" href="./acl-2011-Predicting_Clicks_in_a_Vocabulary_Learning_System.html">248 acl-2011-Predicting Clicks in a Vocabulary Learning System</a></p>
<p>Author: Aaron Michelony</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of predicting which words a student will click in a vocabulary learning system. Often a language learner will find value in the ability to look up the meaning of an unknown word while reading an electronic document by clicking the word. Highlighting words likely to be unknown to a readeris attractive due to drawing his orher attention to it and indicating that information is available. However, this option is usually done manually in vocabulary systems and online encyclopedias such as Wikipedia. Furthurmore, it is never on a per-user basis. This paper presents an automated way of highlighting words likely to be unknown to the specific user. We present related work in search engine ranking, a description of the study used to collect click data, the experiment we performed using the random forest machine learning algorithm and finish with a discussion of future work.</p><p>3 0.11635871 <a title="31-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Language_Use%3A_What_can_it_tell_us%3F.html">194 acl-2011-Language Use: What can it tell us?</a></p>

For instance, can a machine detect that someone is attempting to persuade another to action or to change beliefs or is asserting their credibility? We report results on both English and Arabic discussion forums. 1</p><p>4 0.11545272 <a title="31-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Towards_Style_Transformation_from_Written-Style_to_Audio-Style.html">306 acl-2011-Towards Style Transformation from Written-Style to Audio-Style</a></p>

<p>Author: Sara Rosenthal ; Kathleen McKeown</p><p>Abstract: We investigate whether wording, stylistic choices, and online behavior can be used to predict the age category of blog authors. Our hypothesis is that significant changes in writing style distinguish pre-social media bloggers from post-social media bloggers. Through experimentation with a range of years, we found that the birth dates of students in college at the time when social media such as AIM, SMS text messaging, MySpace and Facebook first became popular, enable accurate age prediction. We also show that internet writing characteristics are important features for age prediction, but that lexical content is also needed to produce significantly more accurate results. Our best results allow for 81.57% accuracy.</p><p>2 0.69181025 <a title="31-lsi-2" href="./acl-2011-Social_Network_Extraction_from_Texts%3A_A_Thesis_Proposal.html">286 acl-2011-Social Network Extraction from Texts: A Thesis Proposal</a></p>

<p>Author: Philip Bramsen ; Martha Escobar-Molano ; Ami Patel ; Rafael Alonso</p><p>Abstract: Sociolinguists have long argued that social context influences language use in all manner of ways, resulting in lects 1. This paper explores a text classification problem we will call lect modeling, an example of what has been termed computational sociolinguistics. In particular, we use machine learning techniques to identify social power relationships between members of a social network, based purely on the content of their interpersonal communication. We rely on statistical methods, as opposed to language-specific engineering, to extract features which represent vocabulary and grammar usage indicative of social power lect. We then apply support vector machines to model the social power lects representing superior-subordinate communication in the Enron email corpus. Our results validate the treatment of lect modeling as a text classification problem – albeit a hard one – and constitute a case for future research in computational sociolinguistics. 1</p><p>5 0.65559399 <a title="31-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Lost_in_Translation%3A_Authorship_Attribution_using_Frame_Semantics.html">214 acl-2011-Lost in Translation: Authorship Attribution using Frame Semantics</a></p>

<p>Author: Annette Hautli ; Sebastian Sulger</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a method for automatically extracting and classifying multiword expressions (MWEs) for Urdu on the basis of a relatively small unannotated corpus (around 8.12 million tokens). The MWEs are extracted by an unsupervised method and classified into two distinct classes, namely locations and person names. The classification is based on simple heuristics that take the co-occurrence of MWEs with distinct postpositions into account. The resulting classes are evaluated against a hand-annotated gold standard and achieve an f-score of 0.5 and 0.746 for locations and persons, respectively. A target application is the Urdu ParGram grammar, where MWEs are needed to generate a more precise syntactic and semantic analysis.</p><p>2 0.90302652 <a title="31-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Unsupervised_Discovery_of_Rhyme_Schemes.html">321 acl-2011-Unsupervised Discovery of Rhyme Schemes</a></p>

<p>Author: Taniya Mishra ; Srinivas Bangalore</p><p>Abstract: There are several theories regarding what influences prominence assignment in English noun-noun compounds. We have developed corpus-driven models for automatically predicting prominence assignment in noun-noun compounds using feature sets based on two such theories: the informativeness theory and the semantic composition theory. The evaluation of the prediction models indicate that though both of these theories are relevant, they account for different types of variability in prominence assignment.</p><p>5 0.77150202 <a title="31-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Efficient_CCG_Parsing%3A_A%2A_versus_Adaptive_Supertagging.html">112 acl-2011-Efficient CCG Parsing: A* versus Adaptive Supertagging</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Auli ; Adam Lopez</p><p>Abstract: We present a systematic comparison and combination of two orthogonal techniques for efficient parsing of Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG). First we consider adaptive supertagging, a widely used approximate search technique that prunes most lexical categories from the parser’s search space using a separate sequence model. Next we consider several variants on A*, a classic exact search technique which to our knowledge has not been applied to more expressive grammar formalisms like CCG. In addition to standard hardware-independent measures of parser effort we also present what we believe is the first evaluation of A* parsing on the more realistic but more stringent metric of CPU time. By itself, A* substantially reduces parser effort as measured by the number of edges considered during parsing, but we show that for CCG this does not always correspond to improvements in CPU time over a CKY baseline. Combining A* with adaptive supertagging decreases CPU time by 15% for our best model.</p><p>same-paper 6 0.77029431 <a title="31-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Age_Prediction_in_Blogs%3A_A_Study_of_Style%2C_Content%2C_and_Online_Behavior_in_Pre-_and_Post-Social_Media_Generations.html">31 acl-2011-Age Prediction in Blogs: A Study of Style, Content, and Online Behavior in Pre- and Post-Social Media Generations</a></p>

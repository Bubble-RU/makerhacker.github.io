<p>Author: Jingbo Zhu ; Tong Xiao</p><p>Abstract: To address the parse error issue for tree-tostring translation, this paper proposes a similarity-based decoding generation (SDG) solution by reconstructing similar source parse trees for decoding at the decoding time instead of taking multiple source parse trees as input for decoding. Experiments on Chinese-English translation demonstrated that our approach can achieve a significant improvement over the standard method, and has little impact on decoding speed in practice. Our approach is very easy to implement, and can be applied to other paradigms such as tree-to-tree models. 1</p><p>3 0.23887892 <a title="155-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Minimum_Bayes-risk_System_Combination.html">220 acl-2011-Minimum Bayes-risk System Combination</a></p>
<p>Author: Jesus Gonzalez-Rubio ; Alfons Juan ; Francisco Casacuberta</p><p>Abstract: We present minimum Bayes-risk system combination, a method that integrates consensus decoding and system combination into a unified multi-system minimum Bayes-risk (MBR) technique. Unlike other MBR methods that re-rank translations of a single SMT system, MBR system combination uses the MBR decision rule and a linear combination of the component systems’ probability distributions to search for the minimum risk translation among all the finite-length strings over the output vocabulary. We introduce expected BLEU, an approximation to the BLEU score that allows to efficiently apply MBR in these conditions. MBR system combination is a general method that is independent of specific SMT models, enabling us to combine systems with heterogeneous structure. Experiments show that our approach bring significant improvements to single-system-based MBR decoding and achieves comparable results to different state-of-the-art system combination methods.</p><p>4 0.22257665 <a title="155-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Learning_Hierarchical_Translation_Structure_with_Linguistic_Annotations.html">202 acl-2011-Learning Hierarchical Translation Structure with Linguistic Annotations</a></p>
<p>Author: Markos Mylonakis ; Khalil Sima'an</p><p>Abstract: While it is generally accepted that many translation phenomena are correlated with linguistic structures, employing linguistic syntax for translation has proven a highly non-trivial task. The key assumption behind many approaches is that translation is guided by the source and/or target language parse, employing rules extracted from the parse tree or performing tree transformations. These approaches enforce strict constraints and might overlook important translation phenomena that cross linguistic constituents. We propose a novel flexible modelling approach to introduce linguistic information of varying granularity from the source side. Our method induces joint probability synchronous grammars and estimates their parameters, by select- ing and weighing together linguistically motivated rules according to an objective function directly targeting generalisation over future data. We obtain statistically significant improvements across 4 different language pairs with English as source, mounting up to +1.92 BLEU for Chinese as target.</p><p>5 0.19432592 <a title="155-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Rule_Markov_Models_for_Fast_Tree-to-String_Translation.html">268 acl-2011-Rule Markov Models for Fast Tree-to-String Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ashish Vaswani ; Haitao Mi ; Liang Huang ; David Chiang</p><p>Abstract: Most statistical machine translation systems rely on composed rules (rules that can be formed out of smaller rules in the grammar). Though this practice improves translation by weakening independence assumptions in the translation model, it nevertheless results in huge, redundant grammars, making both training and decoding inefficient. Here, we take the opposite approach, where we only use minimal rules (those that cannot be formed out of other rules), and instead rely on a rule Markov model of the derivation history to capture dependencies between minimal rules. Large-scale experiments on a state-of-the-art tree-to-string translation system show that our approach leads to a slimmer model, a faster decoder, yet the same translation quality (measured using B ) as composed rules.</p><p>6 0.19060072 <a title="155-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Discriminative_Feature-Tied_Mixture_Modeling_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">100 acl-2011-Discriminative Feature-Tied Mixture Modeling for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Taro Watanabe ; Eiichiro Sumita</p><p>Abstract: The state-of-the-art system combination method for machine translation (MT) is based on confusion networks constructed by aligning hypotheses with regard to word similarities. We introduce a novel system combination framework in which hypotheses are encoded as a confusion forest, a packed forest representing alternative trees. The forest is generated using syntactic consensus among parsed hypotheses: First, MT outputs are parsed. Second, a context free grammar is learned by extracting a set of rules that constitute the parse trees. Third, a packed forest is generated starting from the root symbol of the extracted grammar through non-terminal rewriting. The new hypothesis is produced by searching the best derivation in the forest. Experimental results on the WMT10 system combination shared task yield comparable performance to the conventional confusion network based method with smaller space.</p><p>6 0.59031326 <a title="155-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Incremental_Syntactic_Language_Models_for_Phrase-based_Translation.html">171 acl-2011-Incremental Syntactic Language Models for Phrase-based Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Carolina Parada ; Mark Dredze ; Abhinav Sethy ; Ariya Rastrow</p><p>Abstract: Large vocabulary speech recognition systems fail to recognize words beyond their vocabulary, many of which are information rich terms, like named entities or foreign words. Hybrid word/sub-word systems solve this problem by adding sub-word units to large vocabulary word based systems; new words can then be represented by combinations of subword units. Previous work heuristically created the sub-word lexicon from phonetic representations of text using simple statistics to select common phone sequences. We propose a probabilistic model to learn the subword lexicon optimized for a given task. We consider the task of out of vocabulary (OOV) word detection, which relies on output from a hybrid model. A hybrid model with our learned sub-word lexicon reduces error by 6.3% and 7.6% (absolute) at a 5% false alarm rate on an English Broadcast News and MIT Lectures task respectively.</p><p>5 0.88975298 <a title="155-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Improving_Question_Recommendation_by_Exploiting_Information_Need.html">169 acl-2011-Improving Question Recommendation by Exploiting Information Need</a></p>

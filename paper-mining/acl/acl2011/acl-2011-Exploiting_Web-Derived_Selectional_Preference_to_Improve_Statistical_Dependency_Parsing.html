<p>Author: Mohit Bansal ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Counts from large corpora (like the web) can be powerful syntactic cues. Past work has used web counts to help resolve isolated ambiguities, such as binary noun-verb PP attachments and noun compound bracketings. In this work, we first present a method for generating web count features that address the full range of syntactic attachments. These features encode both surface evidence of lexical affinities as well as paraphrase-based cues to syntactic structure. We then integrate our features into full-scale dependency and constituent parsers. We show relative error reductions of7.0% over the second-order dependency parser of McDonald and Pereira (2006), 9.2% over the constituent parser of Petrov et al. (2006), and 3.4% over a non-local constituent reranker.</p><p>3 0.23817594 <a title="127-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Transition-based_Dependency_Parsing_with_Rich_Non-local_Features.html">309 acl-2011-Transition-based Dependency Parsing with Rich Non-local Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Yue Zhang ; Joakim Nivre</p><p>Abstract: Transition-based dependency parsers generally use heuristic decoding algorithms but can accommodate arbitrarily rich feature representations. In this paper, we show that we can improve the accuracy of such parsers by considering even richer feature sets than those employed in previous systems. In the standard Penn Treebank setup, our novel features improve attachment score form 91.4% to 92.9%, giving the best results so far for transitionbased parsing and rivaling the best results overall. For the Chinese Treebank, they give a signficant improvement of the state of the art. An open source release of our parser is freely available.</p><p>4 0.20665053 <a title="127-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-An_Ensemble_Model_that_Combines_Syntactic_and_Semantic_Clustering_for_Discriminative_Dependency_Parsing.html">39 acl-2011-An Ensemble Model that Combines Syntactic and Semantic Clustering for Discriminative Dependency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Gholamreza Haffari ; Marzieh Razavi ; Anoop Sarkar</p><p>Abstract: We combine multiple word representations based on semantic clusters extracted from the (Brown et al., 1992) algorithm and syntactic clusters obtained from the Berkeley parser (Petrov et al., 2006) in order to improve discriminative dependency parsing in the MSTParser framework (McDonald et al., 2005). We also provide an ensemble method for combining diverse cluster-based models. The two contributions together significantly improves unlabeled dependency accuracy from 90.82% to 92. 13%.</p><p>5 0.1849688 <a title="127-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Getting_the_Most_out_of_Transition-based_Dependency_Parsing.html">143 acl-2011-Getting the Most out of Transition-based Dependency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Jinho D. Choi ; Martha Palmer</p><p>Abstract: This paper suggests two ways of improving transition-based, non-projective dependency parsing. First, we add a transition to an existing non-projective parsing algorithm, so it can perform either projective or non-projective parsing as needed. Second, we present a bootstrapping technique that narrows down discrepancies between gold-standard and automatic parses used as features. The new addition to the algorithm shows a clear advantage in parsing speed. The bootstrapping technique gives a significant improvement to parsing accuracy, showing near state-of-theart performance with respect to other parsing approaches evaluated on the same data set.</p><p>6 0.1840263 <a title="127-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-HITS-based_Seed_Selection_and_Stop_List_Construction_for_Bootstrapping.html">148 acl-2011-HITS-based Seed Selection and Stop List Construction for Bootstrapping</a></p>

<p>Author: Roy Schwartz ; Omri Abend ; Roi Reichart ; Ari Rappoport</p><p>Abstract: Dependency parsing is a central NLP task. In this paper we show that the common evaluation for unsupervised dependency parsing is highly sensitive to problematic annotations. We show that for three leading unsupervised parsers (Klein and Manning, 2004; Cohen and Smith, 2009; Spitkovsky et al., 2010a), a small set of parameters can be found whose modification yields a significant improvement in standard evaluation measures. These parameters correspond to local cases where no linguistic consensus exists as to the proper gold annotation. Therefore, the standard evaluation does not provide a true indication of algorithm quality. We present a new measure, Neutral Edge Direction (NED), and show that it greatly reduces this undesired phenomenon.</p><p>5 0.72841227 <a title="127-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Effects_of_Noun_Phrase_Bracketing_in_Dependency_Parsing_and_Machine_Translation.html">111 acl-2011-Effects of Noun Phrase Bracketing in Dependency Parsing and Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathan Green</p><p>Abstract: Flat noun phrase structure was, up until recently, the standard in annotation for the Penn Treebanks. With the recent addition of internal noun phrase annotation, dependency parsing and applications down the NLP pipeline are likely affected. Some machine translation systems, such as TectoMT, use deep syntax as a language transfer layer. It is proposed that changes to the noun phrase dependency parse will have a cascading effect down the NLP pipeline and in the end, improve machine translation output, even with a reduction in parser accuracy that the noun phrase structure might cause. This paper examines this noun phrase structure’s effect on dependency parsing, in English, with a maximum spanning tree parser and shows a 2.43%, 0.23 Bleu score, improvement for English to Czech machine translation. .</p><p>6 0.7097342 <a title="127-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Using_Large_Monolingual_and_Bilingual_Corpora_to_Improve_Coordination_Disambiguation.html">331 acl-2011-Using Large Monolingual and Bilingual Corpora to Improve Coordination Disambiguation</a></p>

The system that uses character cross-correlation achieves ROUGE-L score of 0. 19384 while the exact word matching scores only 0. 17252 for the same set of documents. 1</p><p>2 0.91307449 <a title="127-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-Optimistic_Backtracking_-_A_Backtracking_Overlay_for_Deterministic_Incremental_Parsing.html">236 acl-2011-Optimistic Backtracking - A Backtracking Overlay for Deterministic Incremental Parsing</a></p>

The method could theoretically be implemented on any other transition-based parser with some adjustments.

The backtracking strategy may serve to improve existing parsers, or to assess if a deterministic parser would benefit from backtracking as a strategy to improve parsing.</p><p>3 0.88888264 <a title="127-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Prefix_Probability_for_Probabilistic_Synchronous_Context-Free_Grammars.html">250 acl-2011-Prefix Probability for Probabilistic Synchronous Context-Free Grammars</a></p>

<p>Author: Lei Zhang ; Bing Liu</p><p>Abstract: Identifying domain-dependent opinion words is a key problem in opinion mining and has been studied by several researchers. However, existing work has been focused on adjectives and to some extent verbs. Limited work has been done on nouns and noun phrases. In our work, we used the feature-based opinion mining model, and we found that in some domains nouns and noun phrases that indicate product features may also imply opinions. In many such cases, these nouns are not subjective but objective. Their involved sentences are also objective sentences and imply positive or negative opinions. Identifying such nouns and noun phrases and their polarities is very challenging but critical for effective opinion mining in these domains. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been studied in the literature. This paper proposes a method to deal with the problem. Experimental results based on real-life datasets show promising results. 1</p><p>6 0.87648052 <a title="127-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Age_Prediction_in_Blogs%3A_A_Study_of_Style%2C_Content%2C_and_Online_Behavior_in_Pre-_and_Post-Social_Media_Generations.html">31 acl-2011-Age Prediction in Blogs: A Study of Style, Content, and Online Behavior in Pre- and Post-Social Media Generations</a></p>

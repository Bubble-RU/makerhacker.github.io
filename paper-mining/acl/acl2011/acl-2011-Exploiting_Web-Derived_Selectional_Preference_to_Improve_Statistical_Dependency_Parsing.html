</p><p>5 1 Introduction Dependency parsing is the task of building dependency links between words in a sentence, which has recently gained a wide interest in the natural language processing community. [sent-9, score-0.449]
</p><p>6 , 1993), it is easy to train a high-performance dependency parser using supervised learning methods. [sent-11, score-0.375]
</p><p>7 However, current state-of-the-art statistical dependency parsers (McDonald et al. [sent-12, score-0.432]
</p><p>8 The length of a dependency from word wi to word wj is simply equal to |i − j |. [sent-21, score-0.353]
</p><p>9 Figure 1 shows the F1 score1 relative to the dependency length on the development set by using the graph-based dependency parsers (McDonald et al. [sent-24, score-0.785]
</p><p>10 We note that the parsers provide very good results for adjacent dependencies (96. [sent-26, score-0.16]
</p><p>11 89% for dependency length =1), while the dependency length increases, the accuracies degrade sharply. [sent-27, score-0.755]
</p><p>12 These longer dependencies are therefore a major opportunity to improve the overall performance of dependency parsing. [sent-28, score-0.413]
</p><p>13 (2008) proposed a semi-supervised dependency parsing by introducing lexical intermediaries at a coarser level than words themselves via a cluster method. [sent-35, score-0.449]
</p><p>14 This approach, however, ignores the selectional preference for word-to-word interactions, such as head-modifier relationship. [sent-36, score-0.625]

</p><p>16 Our purpose in this paper is to exploit web-  derived selectional preferences to improve the supervised statistical dependency parsing. [sent-42, score-0.927]
</p><p>17 All of our lexical statistics are derived from two kinds of webscale corpus: one is the web, which is the largest data set that is available for NLP (Keller and Lapata, 2003). [sent-43, score-0.215]
</p><p>18 By leveraging some assistant data, the dependency parsing model can directly utilize the additional information to capture the word-to-word level relationships. [sent-46, score-0.449]
</p><p>19 We address two natural and related questions which some previous studies leave open: Question I: Is there a benefit in incorporating web-derived selectional preference features for statistical dependency parsing, especially for longer dependencies? [sent-47, score-1.072]
</p><p>20 Question II: How well do web-derived selectional preferences perform on new domains? [sent-48, score-0.565]
</p><p>21 For Question I, we systematically assess the value of using web-scale data in state-of-the-art supervised dependency parsers. [sent-49, score-0.325]
</p><p>22 We compare dependency parsers that include or exclude selectional prefer-  ence features obtained from web-scale corpus. [sent-50, score-0.931]
</p><p>23 To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing studies directly address long dependencies of dependency parsing by using web-scale data. [sent-51, score-0.566]
</p><p>24 In this paper we incorporate the web-derived selectional preference features to design our parsers for robust opendomain testing. [sent-59, score-0.824]
</p><p>25 The results show that web-derived selectional preference can improve the statistical dependency parsing, partic-  ularly for long dependency relationships. [sent-62, score-1.311]
</p><p>26 More importantly, when operating on new domains, the webderived selectional preference features show great potential for achieving robust performance (Section 4. [sent-63, score-0.828]
</p><p>27 Section 2 gives a brief introduction of dependency parsing. [sent-66, score-0.325]
</p><p>28 2 Dependency Parsing In dependency parsing, we attempt to build headmodifier (or head-dependent) relations between words in a sentence. [sent-70, score-0.368]
</p><p>29 The probability of a parse tree is  p(y|x;w) =Z(x1;w)exp{ρ∑∈yw · Φ(x,ρ)}  (1)  where Z(x; w) is the partition function and Φ are part-factored feature functions that include headmodifier parts, sibling parts and grandchild parts. [sent-74, score-0.238]
</p><p>30 1 Web-scale resources All of our selectional preference features described in this paper rely on probabilities derived from unlabeled data. [sent-81, score-0.78]
</p><p>31 4Selectional preference tells us which arguments are plausible for a particular predicate, one way to determine the selectional preference is from co-occurrences of predicates and arguments in text (Bergsma et al. [sent-91, score-0.81]
</p><p>32 In this paper, the  selectional preferences have the same meaning with N-grams, which model the word-to-word relationships, rather than only considering the predicates and arguments relationships. [sent-93, score-0.565]

</p><p>34 1 PMI Previous work on noun compounds bracketing has used adjacency model (Resnik, 1993) and dependency model (Lauer, 1995) to compute associa-  tion statistics between pairs of words. [sent-103, score-0.498]
</p><p>35 In this paper we generalize the adjacency and dependency models by including the pointwise mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1900) between all pairs of words in the dependency tree:  PMI(x,y) = logp(“px(”“)xp y(“”)y”)  (3)  where p( “x y” ) is the co-occurrence probabilities. [sent-104, score-0.679]
</p><p>36 When use the Google V1 corpus, this probabilities can be calculated directly from the N-gram counts, while using the Google hits, we send the queries to the search engine Google5 and all the search queries are performed as exact matches by using quotation marks. [sent-105, score-0.245]
</p><p>37 tween the three words in the dependency tree:  PMI(x,y,z) = logp(“xp( y“”x) yp( z“”y) z”)  (4)  This kinds of trigram features, for example in MSTParser, which can directly capture the sibling and grandchild features. [sent-116, score-0.487]
</p><p>38 We illustrate the PMI features with an example of dependency parsing tree in Figure 2. [sent-117, score-0.508]
</p><p>39 In deciding the dependency between the main verb hit and its argument headed preposition with, an example of the N-gram PMI features and the conjoin features with the baseline are shown in Table 1. [sent-118, score-0.685]
</p><p>40 2 PP-attachment Propositional phrase (PP) attachment is one of  the hardest problems in English dependency parsing. [sent-121, score-0.419]
</p><p>41 Ambiguity resolution reflects the selectional preference between the verb and noun with their prepositional phrase. [sent-123, score-0.801]
</p><p>42 For example, considering the following two examples: (1) John hit the ball with the bat. [sent-124, score-0.269]
</p><p>43 In sentence (1), the preposition with depends on the main verb hit; but in sentence (2), the prepositional phrase is a noun attribute and the preposition with needs to depends on the word ball. [sent-126, score-0.394]
</p><p>44 We thus have PP-attachment features that determine the PMI association across the preposition word “IN”7:  PMIIN(x,z) = logp(“xp( IxN) z”)  (5)  7Here, the preposition word “IN” (e. [sent-128, score-0.215]
</p><p>45 For example, “hw, mw” reprsents a class of indicator features with one feature for each possible combination of head word and modifier word. [sent-134, score-0.159]
</p><p>46 PMIIN(y,z) = logp(“yp( IyN) z”)  (6)  where the word x and y are usually verb and noun, z is a noun which directly depends on the preposition word “IN”. [sent-137, score-0.211]
</p><p>47 If both PMI features exist and PMIwith(hit, bat) > PMIwith(ball, bat), indicating to our dependency parsing model that the preposition word with depends on the verb hit is a good choice. [sent-139, score-0.781]
</p><p>48 The surrounding word N-gram features represent the local context of the selectional preference. [sent-149, score-0.499]
</p><p>49 Besides, we also present  the second-order feature templates, including the sibling and grandchild features. [sent-150, score-0.195]
</p><p>50 2, for sentence (1), the dependency graph path feature ball → with → bat should have a lower weight sbianlcle →bal wl rarely →i sb mto sdhiofiueldd by bat, obwute ris w eofigtehnt seen through them (e. [sent-154, score-0.687]

[sent-158, score-1.055]
</p><p>52 Web-derived selectional preference features based on PMI values are trickier to incorporate into the dependency parsing model because they are continuous rather than discrete. [sent-159, score-1.133]
</p><p>53 Log-linear dependency parsing model is sensitive to inappropriately scaled feature. [sent-162, score-0.449]
</p><p>54 4  Experiments  In order to evaluate the effectiveness ofour proposed approach, we conducted dependency parsing experiments in English. [sent-165, score-0.449]
</p><p>55 , 1993), using a standard set of head-selection rules (Yamada 1560 and Matsumoto, 2003) to convert the phrase structure syntax of the Treebank into a dependency tree representation, dependency labels were obtained via the ”Malt” hard-coded setting. [sent-167, score-0.65]
</p><p>56 Web page hits for word pairs and trigrams are obtained using a simple heuristic query to the search engine Google. [sent-170, score-0.314]
</p><p>57 These forms are then submitted as literal queries, and the resulting hits are summed up. [sent-172, score-0.205]
</p><p>58 We measured the performance of the parsers using the following metrics: unlabeled attachment score (UAS), labeled attachment score (LAS) and complete match (CM), which were defined by Hall et al. [sent-175, score-0.354]
</p><p>59 First, performance increases with the order of the parser: edge-factored model (dep1) has the lowest performance, adding sibling and grandchild relationships (dep2) significantly increases perfor-  mance. [sent-180, score-0.209]
</p><p>60 Second, note that the parsers incorporating the Ngram feature sets consistently outperform the models using the baseline features in all test data sets, regardless of model order or label usage. [sent-183, score-0.199]
</p><p>61 Abbreviation:  dep1/dep2=first-order parser and second-order parser with the baseline features; +hits=N-gram features derived from the Google hits; +V1=N-gram features derived from the Google V1; suffix-L=labeled parser. [sent-215, score-0.292]
</p><p>62 Unlabeled parsers are scored using unlabeled parent predictions, and labeled parsers are scored using labeled parent predictions. [sent-216, score-0.273]
</p><p>63 finding is that the N-gram features derived from Google hits are slightly better than Google V1 due to the large N-gram coverage, we will discuss later. [sent-217, score-0.301]
</p><p>64 Google hits is the largest N-gram data and shows the best performance. [sent-235, score-0.205]
</p><p>65 Although Google hits is noisier, it has very much larger coverage of bigrams or trigrams. [sent-241, score-0.205]
</p><p>66 We have shown that this trend continues well for dependency parsing by using web-scale data (NEWS and Google V1). [sent-246, score-0.449]
</p><p>67 2 Improvement relative to dependency length The experiments in (McDonald and Nivre, 2007) showed a negative impact on the dependency parsing performance from too long dependencies. [sent-258, score-0.838]
</p><p>68 For our proposed approach, the improvement relative to dependency length is shown in Figure 4. [sent-259, score-0.353]
</p><p>69 From the Figure, it is seen that our method gives observable better performance when dependency lengths are larger than 3. [sent-260, score-0.325]
</p><p>70 The results here show that the proposed approach improves the dependency parsing performance, particularly for long dependency relationships. [sent-261, score-0.869]
</p><p>71 3 Cross-genre testing In this section, we present the experiments to validate the robustness the web-derived selectional preferences. [sent-263, score-0.44]
</p><p>72 The intent is to understand how well the web-derived selectional preferences transfer to other sources. [sent-264, score-0.565]
</p><p>73 WSJ is  the performance of our second-order dependency parser trained on section 2-21; WSJ+N-gram is the performance of our proposed approach trained on section 2-21; WSJ+BioMed is the performance of the parser trained on WSJ and biomedical data. [sent-272, score-0.489]
</p><p>74 The results show that incorporating the webscale N-gram features can significantly improve the dependency parsing performance, and the improvement is much larger than the in-domain testing presented in Section 4. [sent-274, score-0.638]
</p><p>75 4  Discussion  In this paper, we present a novel method to improve dependency parsing by using web-scale data. [sent-277, score-0.449]
</p><p>76 (1) Google hits is less sparse than Google V1 in modeling the word-to-word relationships, but Google hits are likely to be noisier than Google V1. [sent-279, score-0.444]
</p><p>77 It is very appealing to carry out a correlation anal-  WSJ: performance of parser trained only on WSJ; WSJ+N-gram: performance of our proposed approach trained only on WSJ; WSJ+BioMed: parser trained on WSJ and biomedical text; WSJ+BioMed+N-gram: our approach trained on WSJ and biomedical text.

</p><p>79 (2) Veronis (2005) pointed out that there had been a debate about reliability of Google hits due to the  inconsistencies of page hits estimates. [sent-283, score-0.41]
</p><p>80 5  Related Work  Our approach is to exploit web-derived selectional preferences to improve the dependency parsing. [sent-289, score-0.89]
</p><p>81 Our research, however, applies the web-scale data (Google hits and Google V1) to model the word-to-word dependency relationships rather than compound bracketing disambiguation. [sent-295, score-0.699]
</p><p>82 1563 Several previous studies have exploited the webscale data for word pair acquisition. [sent-296, score-0.158]
</p><p>83 Keller and Lapata (2003) evaluated the utility of using web search engine statistics for unseen bigram. [sent-297, score-0.16]

</p><p>85 (2010) created robust supervised classifiers via web-scale N-gram data for adjective ordering, spelling correction, noun compound bracketing and verb part-of-speech disambiguation. [sent-302, score-0.257]
</p><p>86 Our approach, however, extends these techniques to dependency parsing, particularly for long dependency relationships, which involves more challenging tasks than the previous work. [sent-303, score-0.715]
</p><p>87 Johnson and Riezler (2000) incorporated the lexical selectional preference features derived from British National Corpus (Graff, 2003) into a stochastic unification-based grammar. [sent-306, score-0.721]
</p><p>88 Abekawa and Okumura (2006) improved Japanese dependency parsing by using the co-occurrence information derived from the results of automatic dependency parsing of large-scale corpora. [sent-307, score-0.935]
</p><p>89 However, we explore the webscale data for dependency parsing, the performance improves log-linearly with the number ofparameters (unique N-grams). [sent-308, score-0.485]
</p><p>90 To the best of our knowledge, web-derived selectional preference has not been successfully applied to dependency parsing. [sent-309, score-0.95]
</p><p>91 6  Conclusion  In this paper, we present a novel method which incorporates the web-derived selectional preferences to improve statistical dependency parsing. [sent-310, score-0.89]
</p><p>92 The results show that web-scale data improves the dependency parsing, particularly for long dependency relationships. [sent-311, score-0.745]

<p>Author: Mohit Bansal ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Counts from large corpora (like the web) can be powerful syntactic cues. Past work has used web counts to help resolve isolated ambiguities, such as binary noun-verb PP attachments and noun compound bracketings. In this work, we first present a method for generating web count features that address the full range of syntactic attachments. These features encode both surface evidence of lexical affinities as well as paraphrase-based cues to syntactic structure. We then integrate our features into full-scale dependency and constituent parsers. We show relative error reductions of7.0% over the second-order dependency parser of McDonald and Pereira (2006), 9.2% over the constituent parser of Petrov et al. (2006), and 3.4% over a non-local constituent reranker.</p><p>3 0.24661343 <a title="127-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Transition-based_Dependency_Parsing_with_Rich_Non-local_Features.html">309 acl-2011-Transition-based Dependency Parsing with Rich Non-local Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Yue Zhang ; Joakim Nivre</p><p>Abstract: Transition-based dependency parsers generally use heuristic decoding algorithms but can accommodate arbitrarily rich feature representations. In this paper, we show that we can improve the accuracy of such parsers by considering even richer feature sets than those employed in previous systems. In the standard Penn Treebank setup, our novel features improve attachment score form 91.4% to 92.9%, giving the best results so far for transitionbased parsing and rivaling the best results overall.

<p>Author: Jinho D. Choi ; Martha Palmer</p><p>Abstract: This paper suggests two ways of improving transition-based, non-projective dependency parsing. First, we add a transition to an existing non-projective parsing algorithm, so it can perform either projective or non-projective parsing as needed. Second, we present a bootstrapping technique that narrows down discrepancies between gold-standard and automatic parses used as features. The new addition to the algorithm shows a clear advantage in parsing speed.

<p>Author: Guangyou Zhou ; Jun Zhao ; Kang Liu ; Li Cai</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach which incorporates the web-derived selectional preferences to improve statistical dependency parsing. Conventional selectional preference learning methods have usually focused on word-to-class relations, e.g., a verb selects as its subject a given nominal class. This paper extends previous work to wordto-word selectional preferences by using webscale data. Experiments show that web-scale data improves statistical dependency parsing, particularly for long dependency relationships. There is no data like more data, performance improves log-linearly with the number of parameters (unique N-grams). More importantly, when operating on new domains, we show that using web-derived selectional preferences is essential for achieving robust performance.</p><p>2 0.889296 <a title="127-lsi-2" href="./acl-2011-Web-Scale_Features_for_Full-Scale_Parsing.html">333 acl-2011-Web-Scale Features for Full-Scale Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohit Bansal ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Counts from large corpora (like the web) can be powerful syntactic cues. Past work has used web counts to help resolve isolated ambiguities, such as binary noun-verb PP attachments and noun compound bracketings. In this work, we first present a method for generating web count features that address the full range of syntactic attachments. These features encode both surface evidence of lexical affinities as well as paraphrase-based cues to syntactic structure. We then integrate our features into full-scale dependency and constituent parsers. We show relative error reductions of7.0% over the second-order dependency parser of McDonald and Pereira (2006), 9.2% over the constituent parser of Petrov et al. (2006), and 3.4% over a non-local constituent reranker.</p><p>3 0.88453835 <a title="127-lsi-3" href="./acl-2011-Transition-based_Dependency_Parsing_with_Rich_Non-local_Features.html">309 acl-2011-Transition-based Dependency Parsing with Rich Non-local Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Yue Zhang ; Joakim Nivre</p><p>Abstract: Transition-based dependency parsers generally use heuristic decoding algorithms but can accommodate arbitrarily rich feature representations. In this paper, we show that we can improve the accuracy of such parsers by considering even richer feature sets than those employed in previous systems. In the standard Penn Treebank setup, our novel features improve attachment score form 91.4% to 92.9%, giving the best results so far for transitionbased parsing and rivaling the best results overall. For the Chinese Treebank, they give a signficant improvement of the state of the art.

<p>Author: Kevin Duh ; Akinori Fujino ; Masaaki Nagata</p><p>Abstract: Recent advances in Machine Translation (MT) have brought forth a new paradigm for building NLP applications in low-resource scenarios. To build a sentiment classifier for a language with no labeled resources, one can translate labeled data from another language, then train a classifier on the translated text. This can be viewed as a domain adaptation problem, where labeled translations and test data have some mismatch. Various prior work have achieved positive results using this approach. In this opinion piece, we take a step back and make some general statements about crosslingual adaptation problems. First, we claim that domain mismatch is not caused by MT errors, and accuracy degradation will occur even in the case of perfect MT. Second, we argue that the cross-lingual adaptation problem is qualitatively different from other (monolingual) adaptation problems in NLP; thus new adaptation algorithms ought to be considered. This paper will describe a series of carefullydesigned experiments that led us to these conclusions. 1 Summary Question 1: If MT gave perfect translations (semantically), do we still have a domain adaptation challenge in cross-lingual sentiment classification? Answer: Yes. The reason is that while many lations of a word may be valid, the MT system have a systematic bias. For example, the word some” might be prevalent in English reviews, transmight “awebut in 429 translated reviews, the word “excellent” is generated instead. From the perspective of MT, this translation is correct and preserves sentiment polarity. But from the perspective of a classifier, there is a domain mismatch due to differences in word distributions. Question 2: Can we apply standard adaptation algorithms developed for other (monolingual) adaptation problems to cross-lingual adaptation? Answer: No. It appears that the interaction between target unlabeled data and source data can be rather unexpected in the case of cross-lingual adaptation. We do not know the reason, but our experiments show that the accuracy of adaptation algorithms in cross-lingual scenarios have much higher variance than monolingual scenarios. The goal of this opinion piece is to argue the need to better understand the characteristics of domain adaptation in cross-lingual problems. We invite the reader to disagree with our conclusion (that the true barrier to good performance is not insufficient MT quality, but inappropriate domain adaptation methods). Here we present a series of experiments that led us to this conclusion. First we describe the experiment design (§2) and baselines (§3), before answering Question §12 (§4) dan bda Question 32) (§5). 2 Experiment Design The cross-lingual setup is this: we have labeled data from source domain S and wish to build a sentiment classifier for target domain T. Domain mismatch can arise from language differences (e.g. English vs. translated text) or market differences (e.g. DVD vs. Book reviews). Our experiments will involve fixing Proceedings ofP thoer t4l9atnhd A, Onrnuegaoln M,e Jeuntineg 19 o-f2 t4h,e 2 A0s1s1o.c?i ac t2io0n11 fo Ar Cssoocmiaptuiotanti foonra Clo Lminpguutiast i ocns:aslh Loirntpgaupisetrics , pages 429–433, T to a common testset and varying S. This allows us to experiment with different settings for adaptation. We use the Amazon review dataset of Prettenhofer (2010)1 , due to its wide range of languages (English [EN], Japanese [JP], French [FR], German [DE]) and markets (music, DVD, books). Unlike Prettenhofer (2010), we reverse the direction of cross-lingual adaptation and consider English as target. English is not a low-resource language, but this setting allows for more comparisons. Each source dataset has 2000 reviews, equally balanced between positive and negative. The target has 2000 test samples, large unlabeled data (25k, 30k, 50k samples respectively for Music, DVD, and Books), and an additional 2000 labeled data reserved for oracle experiments. Texts in JP, FR, and DE are translated word-by-word into English with Google Translate.2 We perform three sets of experiments, shown in Table 1. Table 2 lists all the results; we will interpret them in the following sections. Target (T) Source (S) 312BDMToVuasbDkil-ecE1N:ExpDMB eorVuimsDkice-JEnPtN,s eBD,MtuoVBDpuoVsk:-iFDck-iERxFN,T DB,vVoMaDruky-sSiDc.E-, 3 How much performance degradation occurs in cross-lingual adaptation? First, we need to quantify the accuracy degradation under different source data, without consideration of domain adaptation methods. So we train a SVM classifier on labeled source data3, and directly apply it on test data. The oracle setting, which has no domain-mismatch (e.g. train on Music-EN, test on Music-EN), achieves an average test accuracy of (81.6 + 80.9 + 80.0)/3 = 80.8%4. Aver1http://www.webis.de/research/corpora/webis-cls-10 2This is done by querying foreign words to build a bilingual dictionary. The words are converted to tfidf unigram features. 3For all methods we try here, 5% of the 2000 labeled source samples are held-out for parameter tuning. 4See column EN of Table 2, Supervised SVM results. 430 age cross-lingual accuracies are: 69.4% (JP), 75.6% (FR), 77.0% (DE), so degradations compared to oracle are: -11% (JP), -5% (FR), -4% (DE).5 Crossmarket degradations are around -6%6. Observation 1: Degradations due to market and language mismatch are comparable in several cases (e.g. MUSIC-DE and DVD-EN perform similarly for target MUSIC-EN). Observation 2: The ranking of source language by decreasing accuracy is DE > FR > JP. Does this mean JP-EN is a more difficult language pair for MT? The next section will show that this is not necessarily the case. Certainly, the domain mismatch for JP is larger than DE, but this could be due to phenomenon other than MT errors. 4 Where exactly is the domain mismatch? 4.1 Theory of Domain Adaptation We analyze domain adaptation by the concepts of labeling and instance mismatch (Jiang and Zhai, 2007). Let pt(x, y) = pt (y|x)pt (x) be the target distribution of samples x (e.g. unigram feature vec- tor) and labels y (positive / negative). Let ps (x, y) = ps (y|x)ps (x) be the corresponding source distributio(ny. Wx)pe assume that one (or both) of the following distributions differ between source and target: • Instance mismatch: ps (x) pt (x). • Labeling mismatch: ps (y|x) pt(y|x). Instance mismatch implies that the input feature vectors have different distribution (e.g. one dataset uses the word “excellent” often, while the other uses the word “awesome”). This degrades performance because classifiers trained on “excellent” might not know how to classify texts with the word “awesome.” The solution is to tie together these features (Blitzer et al., 2006) or re-weight the input distribution (Sugiyama et al., 2008). Under some assumptions (i.e. covariate shift), oracle accuracy can be achieved theoretically (Shimodaira, 2000). Labeling mismatch implies the same input has different labels in different domains. For example, the JP word meaning “excellent” may be mistranslated as “bad” in English. Then, positive JP = = 5See “Adapt by Language” columns of Table 2. Note JP+FR+DE condition has 6000 labeled samples, so is not directly comparable to other adaptation scenarios (2000 samples). Nevertheless, mixing languages seem to give good results. 6See “Adapt by Market” columns of Table 2.

Each column is an adaptation scenario using different source data. The source data may vary by language or by market. For example, the first row shows that for the target of Music-EN, the accuracy of a SVM trained on translated JP reviews (in the same market) is 68.5, while the accuracy of a SVM trained on DVD reviews (in the same language) is 76.8. “Oracle” indicates training on the same market and same language domain as the target. “JP+FR+DE” indicates the concatenation of JP, FR, DE as source data.

The solution is to filter out these noisy samples (Jiang and Zhai, 2007) or optimize loosely-linked objectives through shared parameters or Bayesian priors (Finkel and Manning, 2009). Which mismatch is responsible for accuracy degradations in cross-lingual adaptation? • Instance mismatch: Systematic Iantessta nwcoerd m diissmtraibtcuhti:on Ssy MT bias gener- sdtiefmferaetinct MfroTm b naturally- occurring English.

This implies that instance mismatch is an important reason for the degradations seen in Section 3.7 4.3 Analysis of Labeling Mismatch We measure labeling mismatch by looking at differences in the weight vectors of oracle SVM and adapted SVM. Intuitively, if a feature has positive weight in the oracle SVM, but negative weight in the adapted SVM, then it is likely a MT mis-translation 7The observant reader may notice that cross-market points exhibit higher coverage but equal accuracy (74-78%) to some cross-lingual points. This suggests that MT output may be more constrained in vocabulary than naturally-occurring English. 0.35 0.3 gnvLrDeiceKe0 0 0. 120.25 510 erts TeCovega0 0 0. .98657 68 70 72 7A4ccuracy76 78 80 82 0.4 68 70 72 7A4ccuracy76 78 80 82 Figure 1: KL Divergence and Coverage vs. accuracy.

Algorithm 1 (with K=2000) shows how we compute polarity flip rate.8 We found that the polarity flip rate does not correlate well with accuracy at all (r = 0.04). Conclusion: Labeling mismatch is not a factor in performance degradation. Nevertheless, we note there is a surprising large number of flips (24% on average). A manual check of the flipped words in BOOK-JP revealed few MT mistakes. Only 3.7% of 450 random EN-JP word pairs checked can be judged as blatantly incorrect (without sentence context). The majority of flipped words do not have a clear sentiment orientation (e.g. “amazon”, “human”, “moreover”). 5 Are standard adaptation algorithms applicable to cross-lingual problems? One of the breakthroughs in cross-lingual text classification is the realization that it can be cast as domain adaptation. This makes available a host of preexisting adaptation algorithms for improving over supervised results. However, we argue that it may be 8The feature normalization in Step 1 is important that the weight magnitudes are comparable. to ensure 432 Algorithm 1 Measuring labeling mismatch Input: Weight vectors for source wsand target wt Input: Target data average sample vector avg(T) Output: Polarity flip rate f 1: Normalize: ws = avg(T) * ws ; wt = avg(T) * wt 2: Set S+ = { K most positive features in ws} 3: Set S− == {{ KK mmoosstt negative ffeeaattuurreess inn wws}} 4: Set T+ == {{ KK m moosstt npoesgiatitivvee f efeaatuturreess i inn w wt}} 5: Set T− == {{ KK mmoosstt negative ffeeaattuurreess inn wwt}} 6: for each= f{e a Ktur me io ∈t T+ adtiov 7: rif e ia c∈h S fe−a ttuhreen i if ∈ = T f + 1 8: enidf fio ∈r 9: for each feature j ∈ T− do 10: rif e j ∈h Sfe+a uthreen j f ∈ = T f + 1 11: enidf fjo r∈ 12: f = 2Kf better to “adapt” the standard adaptation algorithm to the cross-lingual setting. We arrived at this conclusion by trying the adapted counterpart of SVMs off-the-shelf. Recently, (Bergamo and Torresani, 2010) showed that Transductive SVMs (TSVM), originally developed for semi-supervised learning, are also strong adaptation methods. The idea is to train on source data like a SVM, but encourage the classification boundary to divide through low density regions in the unlabeled target data. Table 2 shows that TSVM outperforms SVM in all but one case for cross-market adaptation, but gives mixed results for cross-lingual adaptation. This is a puzzling result considering that both use the same unlabeled data. Why does TSVM exhibit such a large variance on cross-lingual problems, but not on cross-market problems? Is unlabeled target data interacting with source data in some unexpected way? Certainly there are several successful studies (Wan, 2009; Wei and Pal, 2010; Banea et al., 2008), but we think it is important to consider the possibility that cross-lingual adaptation has some fundamental differences. We conjecture that adapting from artificially-generated text (e.g. MT output) is a different story than adapting from naturallyoccurring text (e.g. cross-market). In short, MT is ripe for cross-lingual adaptation; what is not ripe is probably our understanding of the special characteristics of the adaptation problem.

<p>Author: Guangyou Zhou ; Jun Zhao ; Kang Liu ; Li Cai</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach which incorporates the web-derived selectional preferences to improve statistical dependency parsing. Conventional selectional preference learning methods have usually focused on word-to-class relations, e.g., a verb selects as its subject a given nominal class. This paper extends previous work to wordto-word selectional preferences by using webscale data. Experiments show that web-scale data improves statistical dependency parsing, particularly for long dependency relationships. There is no data like more data, performance improves log-linearly with the number of parameters (unique N-grams). More importantly, when operating on new domains, we show that using web-derived selectional preferences is essential for achieving robust performance.</p><p>3 0.94216055 <a title="127-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Neutralizing_Linguistically_Problematic_Annotations_in_Unsupervised_Dependency_Parsing_Evaluation.html">230 acl-2011-Neutralizing Linguistically Problematic Annotations in Unsupervised Dependency Parsing Evaluation</a></p>
<p>Author: Roy Schwartz ; Omri Abend ; Roi Reichart ; Ari Rappoport</p><p>Abstract: Dependency parsing is a central NLP task. In this paper we show that the common evaluation for unsupervised dependency parsing is highly sensitive to problematic annotations. We show that for three leading unsupervised parsers (Klein and Manning, 2004; Cohen and Smith, 2009; Spitkovsky et al., 2010a), a small set of parameters can be found whose modification yields a significant improvement in standard evaluation measures. These parameters correspond to local cases where no linguistic consensus exists as to the proper gold annotation. Therefore, the standard evaluation does not provide a true indication of algorithm quality. We present a new measure, Neutral Edge Direction (NED), and show that it greatly reduces this undesired phenomenon.</p><p>4 0.94047219 <a title="127-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Prefix_Probability_for_Probabilistic_Synchronous_Context-Free_Grammars.html">250 acl-2011-Prefix Probability for Probabilistic Synchronous Context-Free Grammars</a></p>

<p>Author: Bing Xiang ; Abraham Ittycheriah</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel discriminative mixture model for statistical machine translation (SMT). We model the feature space with a log-linear combination ofmultiple mixture components. Each component contains a large set of features trained in a maximumentropy framework. All features within the same mixture component are tied and share the same mixture weights, where the mixture weights are trained discriminatively to maximize the translation performance. This approach aims at bridging the gap between the maximum-likelihood training and the discriminative training for SMT. It is shown that the feature space can be partitioned in a variety of ways, such as based on feature types, word alignments, or domains, for various applications. The proposed approach improves the translation performance significantly on a large-scale Arabic-to-English MT task.</p><p>6 0.92232776 <a title="127-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Event_Extraction_as_Dependency_Parsing.html">122 acl-2011-Event Extraction as Dependency Parsing</a></p>

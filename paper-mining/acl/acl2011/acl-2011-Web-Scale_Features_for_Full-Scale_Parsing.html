</p><p>11 One way to access more information is to exploit surface counts from large corpora like the web (Volk, 2001 ; Lapata and Keller, 2004). [sent-23, score-0.297]
</p><p>12 For example, the  phrase raising from is much more frequent on the Web than $ x billion from. [sent-24, score-0.306]
</p><p>13 While this ‘affinity’ is only a surface correlation, Volk (2001) showed that comparing such counts can often correctly resolve tricky PP attachments. [sent-25, score-0.239]
</p><p>14 For example, Nakov and Hearst (2005b) showed that looking for paraphrase counts can further improve PP resolution. [sent-27, score-0.284]

</p><p>16 Guess edges are in  solid blue, gold edges are in dashed gold and edges common in guess and gold parses are in black. [sent-32, score-0.4]
</p><p>17 Still other work has exploited Web counts for other isolated ambiguities, such as NP coordination (Nakov and Hearst, 2005b) and noun-sequence bracketing (Nakov and Hearst, 2005a; Pitler et al. [sent-34, score-0.379]
</p><p>18 In this paper, we show how to apply these ideas to all attachments in full-scale parsing. [sent-37, score-0.259]
</p><p>19 Affinity features are relatively straightforward, but paraphrase features, which have been hand-developed in the past, are more complex. [sent-40, score-0.265]
</p><p>20 For dependency parsing, we augment the features in the second-order parser of McDonald and Pereira (2006). [sent-42, score-0.366]
</p><p>21 For constituent parsing, we rerank the output of the Berkeley parser (Petrov et al. [sent-43, score-0.317]
</p><p>22 Third, past systems have usually gotten their counts from web search APIs, which does not scale to quadratically-many attachments in each sentence. [sent-45, score-0.519]
</p><p>23 Given the success of Web counts for isolated ambiguities, there is relatively little previous research in this direction. [sent-47, score-0.234]
</p><p>24 (2010), which use Web-scale n-gram counts for multi-way noun bracketing decisions, though that work considers only sequences of nouns and uses only affinity-based web features. [sent-49, score-0.421]
</p><p>25 (2008) smooth the sparseness of lexical features in a discriminative dependency parser by using clusterbased word-senses as intermediate abstractions in 694 addition to POS tags (also see Finkel et al. [sent-53, score-0.409]
</p><p>26 To show end-to-end effectiveness, we incorporate our features into state-of-the-art dependency and constituent parsers. [sent-57, score-0.363]
</p><p>27 For the dependency case, we can integrate them into the dynamic programming of a base parser; we use the discriminativelytrained MST dependency parser (McDonald et al. [sent-58, score-0.351]
</p><p>28 2  Web-count Features  Structural errors in the output of state-of-the-art parsers, constituent or dependency, can be viewed as attachment errors, examples of which are Figure 1 and Figure 2. [sent-69, score-0.488]
</p><p>29 1 One way to address attachment errors is through features which factor over head-argument 1For constituent parsers, there can be minor tree variations which can result in the same set of induced dependencies, but these are rare in comparison. [sent-70, score-0.616]
</p><p>30 ($  raising $ from  from)  debt  Figure 3: Features factored over head-argument pairs. [sent-74, score-0.257]
</p><p>31 Here, we discuss which webcount based features φ(h, a) should fire over a given head-argument pair (we consider the words h and a to be indexed, and so features can be sensitive to their order and distance, as is also standard). [sent-76, score-0.256]
</p><p>32 The approach of Lauer (1995), for example, would be to take an ambiguous noun sequence like hydrogen ion exchange and compare the various counts (or associated con-  ditional probabilities) of n-grams like hydrogen ion and hydrogen exchange. [sent-79, score-0.472]
</p><p>33 Our affinity features closely follow this basic idea of association statistics. [sent-83, score-0.291]
</p><p>34 However, because a real parser will not have access to gold-standard knowledge of the competing attachment sites (see Atterer and Schutze (2007)’s criticism of previous work), we must instead compute features for all possible head-argument pairs from our web corpus. [sent-84, score-0.679]
</p><p>35 Moreover, when there are only two competing attachment options, one can do things like directly compare two count-based heuristics and choose the larger. [sent-85, score-0.313]
</p><p>36 Integration into a parser requires features to be functions of single attachments, not pairwise comparisons between alternatives. [sent-86, score-0.253]
</p><p>37 We employ a collection of affinity features of varying specificity. [sent-88, score-0.291]
</p><p>38 First, rather than a single all-purpose feature like ADJ, the utility of such query counts will vary according to aspects like the parts-of-speech of h and a (because a high adjacency count is not equally informative for all kinds of attachments). [sent-93, score-0.327]
</p><p>39 Hence, we add more refined affinity features that are specific to each pair of POS tags, i. [sent-94, score-0.291]
</p><p>40 Second, using real-valued features did not work as well as binning the query-counts (we used b = floor(logr (count)/5) ∗ 5) and then firing indicator features (AcoDuJn t∧) POS(h) a∧n POS(a) ∧rin bg finorvdiacluaetosr ro ffe ba udrefeisne AdD by ∧the P query c ∧ou PnOt. [sent-98, score-0.411]
</p><p>41 For all features used, we add cumulative variants where indicators are fired for all count bins b0 up to query count bin b. [sent-104, score-0.432]
</p><p>42 2 Paraphrase Features In addition to measuring counts of the words present in the sentence, there exist clever ways in which paraphrases and other accidental indicators can help resolve specific ambiguities, some of which are discussed in Nakov and Hearst (2005a), Nakov and Hearst (2005b). [sent-106, score-0.247]
</p><p>43 For example, finding attestations of eat :spaghetti with sauce suggests a nominal attachment in Jean ate spaghetti with sauce. [sent-107, score-0.357]
</p><p>44 As another example, one clue that the example in Figure 1 is a verbal attachment is that the proform paraphrase raising it from is commonly attested. [sent-108, score-0.632]
</p><p>45 These paraphrase features hint at the correct at-  tachment decision by looking for web n-grams with special contexts that reveal syntax superficially. [sent-110, score-0.378]
</p><p>46 Again, while effective in their isolated disambiguation tasks, past work has been limited by both the range of attachments considered and the need to intuit these special contexts. [sent-111, score-0.393]
</p><p>47 For instance, frequency of the pattern The noun prep suggests noun attachment and of the pattern verb adverb prep suggests verb attachment for the preposition in the phrase verb noun prep, but these features were not in the manually brainstormed list. [sent-112, score-1.522]
</p><p>48 In this work, we automatically generate a large number of paraphrase-style features for arbitrary attachment ambiguities. [sent-113, score-0.441]
</p><p>49 For example, for h = raising and a = from (see Figure 1), we look at web n-grams of the form raising c from and see that one of the most frequent values of c on the web turns out to be the word it. [sent-117, score-0.647]
</p><p>50 Note that h and a are head and argument words and so actually occur in the sentence, but c is a context word that generally does not. [sent-119, score-0.284]
</p><p>51 The idea is that if frequent occurrences of raising it from indicated a correct attachment between raising and from, frequent occurrences of lowering it with will indicate the correct696 ness of an attachment between lowering and with. [sent-122, score-1.244]
</p><p>52 Finally, to handle the cases where no induced context word is helpful, we also construct abstracted versions of these paraphrase features where the con-  text words c are collapsed to their parts-of-speech POS(c), obtained using a unigram-tagger trained on the parser training set. [sent-123, score-0.39]
</p><p>53 As discussed in Section 5, the top features learned by our learning algorithm duplicate the hand-crafted configurations used in previous work (Nakov and Hearst, 2005b) but also add numerous others, and, of course, apply to many more attachment types. [sent-124, score-0.441]
</p><p>54 One challenge with this approach is that an external search API is now embedded into the parser, raising issues of both speed and daily query limits, especially if all possible attachments trigger queries. [sent-128, score-0.542]
</p><p>55 The most basic queries are counts of head-argument pairs in contiguous h a and gapped h ? [sent-137, score-0.243]
</p><p>56 2 Here, we describe how we process queries –  –  2Paraphrase features give situations where we query ? [sent-139, score-0.325]
</p><p>57 The entry for q1 points to an inner hashmap whose key is the final word q2 of the query bigram. [sent-146, score-0.353]
</p><p>58 In similar ways, we also mine the most frequent words that occur before, in between and after the head and argument query pairs. [sent-168, score-0.442]
</p><p>59 For example, to col-  lect mid words, we go through the 3-grams w1w2w3; if w1 matches q¯1 in the outer hashmap and w3 occurs in the inner hashmap for ¯q 1, then we store w2 and the count of the 3-gram. [sent-169, score-0.544]
</p><p>60 We also collect unigram counts of the head and argument words by sweeping over the unigrams once. [sent-171, score-0.391]

</p><p>62 4  Parsing Experiments  Our features are designed to be used in full-sentence parsing rather than for limited decisions about isolated ambiguities. [sent-193, score-0.299]
</p><p>63 We first integrate our features into a dependency parser, where the integration is more natural and pushes all the way into the underlying dynamic program. [sent-194, score-0.241]
</p><p>64 We then add them to a constituent parser in a reranking approach. [sent-195, score-0.319]
</p><p>65 We used the ‘pennconverter’5 tool to convert Penn trees from constituent format to dependency format. [sent-201, score-0.235]
</p><p>66 6 Table 1 shows unlabeled attachments scores (UAS) for their second-order projective parser and the improved numbers resulting from the addition of our Web-scale features. [sent-221, score-0.384]
</p><p>67 2  Constituent Parsing  We also evaluate the utility of web-scale features on top of a state-of-the-art constituent parser the Berkeley parser (Petrov et al. [sent-225, score-0.5]
</p><p>68 Because the underlying parser does not factor along lexical attachments, we instead adopt the discriminative reranking framework, where we generate the top-k candidates from the baseline system and then rerank this k-best list using (generally non-local) features. [sent-227, score-0.31]
</p><p>69 (2009), Koo and Collins (2010) has been exploring more nonlocal features for dependency parsing. [sent-231, score-0.241]
</p><p>70 It will be interesting to see how these features interact with our web features. [sent-232, score-0.241]
</p><p>71 1540  Table 2: Oracle F1-scores for k-best lists output by Berkeley parser for English WSJ parsing (Dev is section 22 and Test is section 23, all lengths). [sent-240, score-0.252]
</p><p>72 The affinity and paraphrase features contribute about two-fifths and three-fifths of this improvement, respectively. [sent-250, score-0.428]
</p><p>73 Finally, we rerank with both our Web-scale features and the configurational features. [sent-253, score-0.273]
</p><p>74 11 5  Analysis  Table 4 shows error counts and relative reductions that our web features provide over the 2nd-order dependency baseline. [sent-258, score-0.595]
</p><p>75 While we do see substantial gains for classic PP (IN) attachment cases, we see equal or greater error reductions for a range of attachment types. [sent-259, score-0.767]
</p><p>76 The columns depict the tag, its total attachments as argument, number of correct ones in baseline (McDonald and Pereira, 2006) and this work, and the relative error reduction. [sent-271, score-0.316]
</p><p>77 Results are for dependency parsing on the dev set for iters:5,training-k:1. [sent-272, score-0.243]
</p><p>78 1% total error reduction for attachments of an IN argument (which includes PPs as well as complementized SBARs) includes many errors where the  gold attachments are to both noun and verb heads. [sent-275, score-0.995]
</p><p>79 Similarly, for an NN-headed argument, the major corrections are for attachments to noun and verb heads, which includes both object-attachment ambiguities and coordination ambiguities. [sent-276, score-0.586]
</p><p>80 We next investigate the features that were given high weight by our learning algorithm (in the constituent parsing case). [sent-277, score-0.334]
</p><p>81 We list only the head and argument POS and the direction (arrow from head to arg). [sent-280, score-0.378]
</p><p>82 Table 6 shows which affinity features received the highest weights, as well as examples of training set attachments for which the feature fired (for concreteness), suppressing both features involving punctua-  tion and the features’ count and distance bins. [sent-284, score-0.757]
</p><p>83 The second row (NN→IN) indicates that whether a preposition i rso appropriate t)o i natdtiaccaht etos a noun eist hwerel al captured by how often that preposition follows that noun. [sent-286, score-0.328]
</p><p>84 All of these features essentially state cases where local surface counts are good indi-  POSheadmid-wordPOSargExample (head, arg)  400) of the mid-word schema for a verb head and preposition argument (with head on left of argument). [sent-288, score-0.929]
</p><p>85 Interestingly, the top such features capture exactly the intuition from Nakov and Hearst (2005b), namely that if the verb h and the preposition a occur with a pronoun in between, we have evidence that a attaches to h (it certainly can’t attach to the pronoun). [sent-293, score-0.503]
</p><p>86 As another example of known useful features being learned automatically, Table 8 shows the previous-context-word paraphrase features for a noun head and preposition argument (N → IN). [sent-295, score-0.851]
</p><p>87 Nnoauknov h aeandd H anedars pt (2005b) suggested tth (aNt th →e attestation of be N IN is a good indicator of attachment to the noun (the IN cannot generally attach to forms of auxiliaries). [sent-296, score-0.611]
</p><p>88 We also find their surface marker / punc700 –  –  bfr-wordPOSheadPOSargExample (head, arg)  400) of the before-word schema for a noun head and preposition argument (with head on left of argument). [sent-298, score-0.694]
</p><p>89 However, we additionally find other cues, most notably that if  the N IN sequence occurs following a capitalized determiner, it tends to indicate a nominal attachment (in the n-gram, the preposition cannot attach leftward to anything else because of the beginning of the sentence). [sent-300, score-0.521]
</p><p>90 In Table 9, we see the top-weight paraphrase features that had a conjunction as a middle-word cue. [sent-301, score-0.265]
</p><p>91 These features essentially say that if two heads w1 and w2 occur in the direct coordination n-gram w1 and w2, then they are good heads to coordinate (coordination unfortunately looks the same as complementation or modification to a basic dependency model). [sent-302, score-0.463]
</p><p>92 These features are relevant to a range of coordination ambiguities. [sent-303, score-0.259]
</p><p>93 Finally, Table 10 depicts the high-weight, highcount general paraphrase-cue features for arbitrary head and argument categories, with those shown in previous tables suppressed. [sent-304, score-0.372]
</p><p>94 The second entry (NN - NN) shows that one noun is a good modifier of another if they frequently appear together hyphenated (another punctuation-based cue mentioned in previous work on noun bracketing, see Nakov and Hearst (2005a)). [sent-309, score-0.24]
</p><p>95 While they were motivated on separate grounds, these features can also compensate for inapplicability of the affinity features. [sent-310, score-0.291]
</p><p>96 6  Conclusion  Web features are a way to bring evidence from a large unlabeled corpus to bear on hard disambiguation decisions that are not easily resolvable based on limited parser training data. [sent-312, score-0.253]
</p><p>97 Our approach allows revealing features to be mined for the entire range of attachment types and then aggregated and balanced in a full parsing setting. [sent-313, score-0.572]
</p><p>98 Our results show that these web features resolve ambiguities not correctly handled by current state-of-the-art systems. [sent-314, score-0.379]

<p>Author: Mohit Bansal ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Counts from large corpora (like the web) can be powerful syntactic cues. Past work has used web counts to help resolve isolated ambiguities, such as binary noun-verb PP attachments and noun compound bracketings. In this work, we first present a method for generating web count features that address the full range of syntactic attachments. These features encode both surface evidence of lexical affinities as well as paraphrase-based cues to syntactic structure. We then integrate our features into full-scale dependency and constituent parsers. We show relative error reductions of7.0% over the second-order dependency parser of McDonald and Pereira (2006), 9.2% over the constituent parser of Petrov et al. (2006), and 3.4% over a non-local constituent reranker.</p><p>2 0.26637268 <a title="333-tfidf-2" href="./acl-2011-Exploiting_Web-Derived_Selectional_Preference_to_Improve_Statistical_Dependency_Parsing.html">127 acl-2011-Exploiting Web-Derived Selectional Preference to Improve Statistical Dependency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Guangyou Zhou ; Jun Zhao ; Kang Liu ; Li Cai</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach which incorporates the web-derived selectional preferences to improve statistical dependency parsing. Conventional selectional preference learning methods have usually focused on word-to-class relations, e.g., a verb selects as its subject a given nominal class. This paper extends previous work to wordto-word selectional preferences by using webscale data.

<p>Author: Shane Bergsma ; David Yarowsky ; Kenneth Church</p><p>Abstract: Resolving coordination ambiguity is a classic hard problem. This paper looks at coordination disambiguation in complex noun phrases (NPs). Parsers trained on the Penn Treebank are reporting impressive numbers these days, but they don’t do very well on this problem (79%). We explore systems trained using three types of corpora: (1) annotated (e.g. the Penn Treebank), (2) bitexts (e.g. Europarl), and (3) unannotated monolingual (e.g. Google N-grams). Size matters: (1) is a million words, (2) is potentially billions of words and (3) is potentially trillions of words. The unannotated monolingual data is helpful when the ambiguity can be resolved through associations among the lexical items. The bilingual data is helpful when the ambiguity can be resolved by the order of words in the translation. We train separate classifiers with monolingual and bilingual features and iteratively improve them via achieves data and pervised tations. co-training. The co-trained classifier close to 96% accuracy on Treebank makes 20% fewer errors than a susystem trained with Treebank anno-</p><p>4 0.20992114 <a title="333-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Transition-based_Dependency_Parsing_with_Rich_Non-local_Features.html">309 acl-2011-Transition-based Dependency Parsing with Rich Non-local Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Yue Zhang ; Joakim Nivre</p><p>Abstract: Transition-based dependency parsers generally use heuristic decoding algorithms but can accommodate arbitrarily rich feature representations. In this paper, we show that we can improve the accuracy of such parsers by considering even richer feature sets than those employed in previous systems. In the standard Penn Treebank setup, our novel features improve attachment score form 91.4% to 92.9%, giving the best results so far for transitionbased parsing and rivaling the best results overall. For the Chinese Treebank, they give a signficant improvement of the state of the art. An open source release of our parser is freely available.</p><p>5 0.19600762 <a title="333-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-An_Ensemble_Model_that_Combines_Syntactic_and_Semantic_Clustering_for_Discriminative_Dependency_Parsing.html">39 acl-2011-An Ensemble Model that Combines Syntactic and Semantic Clustering for Discriminative Dependency Parsing</a></p>

<p>Author: Mohit Bansal ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Counts from large corpora (like the web) can be powerful syntactic cues. Past work has used web counts to help resolve isolated ambiguities, such as binary noun-verb PP attachments and noun compound bracketings. In this work, we first present a method for generating web count features that address the full range of syntactic attachments. These features encode both surface evidence of lexical affinities as well as paraphrase-based cues to syntactic structure. We then integrate our features into full-scale dependency and constituent parsers. We show relative error reductions of7.0% over the second-order dependency parser of McDonald and Pereira (2006), 9.2% over the constituent parser of Petrov et al.

<p>Author: Guangyou Zhou ; Jun Zhao ; Kang Liu ; Li Cai</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach which incorporates the web-derived selectional preferences to improve statistical dependency parsing. Conventional selectional preference learning methods have usually focused on word-to-class relations, e.g., a verb selects as its subject a given nominal class. This paper extends previous work to wordto-word selectional preferences by using webscale data. Experiments show that web-scale data improves statistical dependency parsing, particularly for long dependency relationships. There is no data like more data, performance improves log-linearly with the number of parameters (unique N-grams).

<p>Author: Roy Schwartz ; Omri Abend ; Roi Reichart ; Ari Rappoport</p><p>Abstract: Dependency parsing is a central NLP task. In this paper we show that the common evaluation for unsupervised dependency parsing is highly sensitive to problematic annotations. We show that for three leading unsupervised parsers (Klein and Manning, 2004; Cohen and Smith, 2009; Spitkovsky et al., 2010a), a small set of parameters can be found whose modification yields a significant improvement in standard evaluation measures. These parameters correspond to local cases where no linguistic consensus exists as to the proper gold annotation. Therefore, the standard evaluation does not provide a true indication of algorithm quality. We present a new measure, Neutral Edge Direction (NED), and show that it greatly reduces this undesired phenomenon.</p><p>4 0.74173468 <a title="333-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-An_Ensemble_Model_that_Combines_Syntactic_and_Semantic_Clustering_for_Discriminative_Dependency_Parsing.html">39 acl-2011-An Ensemble Model that Combines Syntactic and Semantic Clustering for Discriminative Dependency Parsing</a></p>

<p>Author: Nathan Green</p><p>Abstract: Flat noun phrase structure was, up until recently, the standard in annotation for the Penn Treebanks. With the recent addition of internal noun phrase annotation, dependency parsing and applications down the NLP pipeline are likely affected. Some machine translation systems, such as TectoMT, use deep syntax as a language transfer layer. It is proposed that changes to the noun phrase dependency parse will have a cascading effect down the NLP pipeline and in the end, improve machine translation output, even with a reduction in parser accuracy that the noun phrase structure might cause. This paper examines this noun phrase structure’s effect on dependency parsing, in English, with a maximum spanning tree parser and shows a 2.43%, 0.23 Bleu score, improvement for English to Czech machine translation. .</p><p>6 0.72158331 <a title="333-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Transition-based_Dependency_Parsing_with_Rich_Non-local_Features.html">309 acl-2011-Transition-based Dependency Parsing with Rich Non-local Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthew R. Scott ; Xiaohua Liu ; Ming Zhou ; Microsoft Engkoo Team</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents Engkoo 1, a system for exploring and learning language. It is built primarily by mining translation knowledge from billions of web pages - using the Internet to catch language in motion. Currently Engkoo is built for Chinese users who are learning English; however the technology itself is language independent and can be extended in the future. At a system level, Engkoo is an application platform that supports a multitude of NLP technologies such as cross language retrieval, alignment, sentence classification, and statistical machine translation. The data set that supports this system is primarily built from mining a massive set of bilingual terms and sentences from across the web. Specifically, web pages that contain both Chinese and English are discovered and analyzed for parallelism, extracted and formulated into clear term definitions and sample sentences. This approach allows us to build perhaps the world’s largest lexicon linking both Chinese and English together - at the same time covering the most up-to-date terms as captured by the net.</p><p>4 0.85029697 <a title="333-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-PsychoSentiWordNet.html">253 acl-2011-PsychoSentiWordNet</a></p>

<p>Author: Emmanuel Prochasson ; Pascale Fung</p><p>Abstract: We present a first known result of high precision rare word bilingual extraction from comparable corpora, using aligned comparable documents and supervised classification. We incorporate two features, a context-vector similarity and a co-occurrence model between words in aligned documents in a machine learning approach. We test our hypothesis on different pairs of languages and corpora. We obtain very high F-Measure between 80% and 98% for recognizing and extracting correct translations for rare terms (from 1to 5 occurrences). Moreover, we show that our system can be trained on a pair of languages and test on a different pair of languages, obtaining a F-Measure of 77% for the classification of Chinese-English translations using a training corpus of Spanish-French. Our method is therefore even potentially applicable to low resources languages without training data.</p><p>6 0.72161883 <a title="333-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Exact_Decoding_of_Syntactic_Translation_Models_through_Lagrangian_Relaxation.html">123 acl-2011-Exact Decoding of Syntactic Translation Models through Lagrangian Relaxation</a></p>

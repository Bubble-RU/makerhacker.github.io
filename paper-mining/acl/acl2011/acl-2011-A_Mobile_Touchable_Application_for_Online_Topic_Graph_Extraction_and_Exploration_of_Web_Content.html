<p>Author: Elias Ponvert ; Jason Baldridge ; Katrin Erk</p><p>Abstract: We consider a new subproblem of unsupervised parsing from raw text, unsupervised partial parsing—the unsupervised version of text chunking. We show that addressing this task directly, using probabilistic finite-state methods, produces better results than relying on the local predictions of a current best unsupervised parser, Seginer’s (2007) CCL. These finite-state models are combined in a cascade to produce more general (full-sentence) constituent structures; doing so outperforms CCL by a wide margin in unlabeled PARSEVAL scores for English, German and Chinese. Finally, we address the use of phrasal punctuation as a heuristic indicator of phrasal boundaries, both in our system and in CCL.</p><p>4 0.12617463 <a title="19-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-A_Speech-based_Just-in-Time_Retrieval_System_using_Semantic_Search.html">26 acl-2011-A Speech-based Just-in-Time Retrieval System using Semantic Search</a></p>

<p>Author: Bo Pang ; Ravi Kumar</p><p>Abstract: Web search is an information-seeking activity. Often times, this amounts to a user seeking answers to a question. However, queries, which encode user’s information need, are typically not expressed as full-length natural language sentences in particular, as questions. Rather, they consist of one or more text fragments. As humans become more searchengine-savvy, do natural-language questions still have a role to play in web search? Through a systematic, large-scale study, we find to our surprise that as time goes by, web users are more likely to use questions to express their search intent. —</p><p>6 0.11197004 <a title="19-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Fine-Grained_Class_Label_Markup_of_Search_Queries.html">137 acl-2011-Fine-Grained Class Label Markup of Search Queries</a></p>

<p>Author: Tony Veale</p><p>Abstract: Information retrieval (IR) and figurative language processing (FLP) could scarcely be more different in their treatment of language and meaning. IR views language as an open-ended set of mostly stable signs with which texts can be indexed and retrieved, focusing more on a text’s potential relevance than its potential meaning. In contrast, FLP views language as a system of unstable signs that can be used to talk about the world in creative new ways. There is another key difference: IR is practical, scalable and robust, and in daily use by millions of casual users. FLP is neither scalable nor robust, and not yet practical enough to migrate beyond the lab. This paper thus presents a mutually beneficial hybrid of IR and FLP, one that enriches IR with new operators to enable the non-literal retrieval of creative expressions, and which also transplants FLP into a robust, scalable framework in which practical applications of linguistic creativity can be implemented. 1</p><p>6 0.43432727 <a title="19-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Exploiting_Readymades_in_Linguistic_Creativity%3A_A_System_Demonstration_of_the_Jigsaw_Bard.html">125 acl-2011-Exploiting Readymades in Linguistic Creativity: A System Demonstration of the Jigsaw Bard</a></p>

<p>Author: Jingbo Zhu ; Tong Xiao</p><p>Abstract: To address the parse error issue for tree-tostring translation, this paper proposes a similarity-based decoding generation (SDG) solution by reconstructing similar source parse trees for decoding at the decoding time instead of taking multiple source parse trees as input for decoding. Experiments on Chinese-English translation demonstrated that our approach can achieve a significant improvement over the standard method, and has little impact on decoding speed in practice. Our approach is very easy to implement, and can be applied to other paradigms such as tree-to-tree models. 1</p><p>4 0.88012642 <a title="19-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Language_Use%3A_What_can_it_tell_us%3F.html">194 acl-2011-Language Use: What can it tell us?</a></p>

<p>Author: Guangyou Zhou ; Li Cai ; Jun Zhao ; Kang Liu</p><p>Abstract: Community-based question answer (Q&A;) has become an important issue due to the popularity of Q&A; archives on the web. This paper is concerned with the problem of question retrieval. Question retrieval in Q&A; archives aims to find historical questions that are semantically equivalent or relevant to the queried questions. In this paper, we propose a novel phrase-based translation model for question retrieval. Compared to the traditional word-based translation models, the phrasebased translation model is more effective because it captures contextual information in modeling the translation ofphrases as a whole, rather than translating single words in isolation. Experiments conducted on real Q&A; data demonstrate that our proposed phrasebased translation model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art word-based translation model.</p><p>6 0.85748678 <a title="19-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Improving_Classification_of_Medical_Assertions_in_Clinical_Notes.html">165 acl-2011-Improving Classification of Medical Assertions in Clinical Notes</a></p>

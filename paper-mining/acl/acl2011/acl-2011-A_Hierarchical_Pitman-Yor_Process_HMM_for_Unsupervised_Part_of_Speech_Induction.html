<p>Author: Coskun Mermer ; Murat Saraclar</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we compare the translation performance of word alignments obtained via Bayesian inference to those obtained via expectation-maximization (EM). We propose a Gibbs sampler for fully Bayesian inference in IBM Model 1, integrating over all possible parameter values in finding the alignment distribution. We show that Bayesian inference outperforms EM in all of the tested language pairs, domains and data set sizes, by up to 2.99 BLEU points. We also show that the proposed method effectively addresses the well-known rare word problem in EM-estimated models; and at the same time induces a much smaller dictionary of bilingual word-pairs. .t r</p><p>3 0.17587557 <a title="15-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Unsupervised_Part-of-Speech_Tagging_with_Bilingual_Graph-Based_Projections.html">323 acl-2011-Unsupervised Part-of-Speech Tagging with Bilingual Graph-Based Projections</a></p>
<p>Author: Dipanjan Das ; Slav Petrov</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel approach for inducing unsupervised part-of-speech taggers for languages that have no labeled training data, but have translated text in a resource-rich language. Our method does not assume any knowledge about the target language (in particular no tagging dictionary is assumed), making it applicable to a wide array of resource-poor languages. We use graph-based label propagation for cross-lingual knowledge transfer and use the projected labels as features in an unsupervised model (BergKirkpatrick et al., 2010). Across eight European languages, our approach results in an average absolute improvement of 10.4% over a state-of-the-art baseline, and 16.7% over vanilla hidden Markov models induced with the Expectation Maximization algorithm.</p><p>4 0.13989559 <a title="15-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-A_Large_Scale_Distributed_Syntactic%2C_Semantic_and_Lexical_Language_Model_for_Machine_Translation.html">17 acl-2011-A Large Scale Distributed Syntactic, Semantic and Lexical Language Model for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ming Tan ; Wenli Zhou ; Lei Zheng ; Shaojun Wang</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an attempt at building a large scale distributed composite language model that simultaneously accounts for local word lexical information, mid-range sentence syntactic structure, and long-span document semantic content under a directed Markov random field paradigm. The composite language model has been trained by performing a convergent N-best list approximate EM algorithm that has linear time complexity and a followup EM algorithm to improve word prediction power on corpora with up to a billion tokens and stored on a supercomputer.

<p>Author: Ivan Titov ; Alexandre Klementiev</p><p>Abstract: We propose a non-parametric Bayesian model for unsupervised semantic parsing. Following Poon and Domingos (2009), we consider a semantic parsing setting where the goal is to (1) decompose the syntactic dependency tree of a sentence into fragments, (2) assign each of these fragments to a cluster of semantically equivalent syntactic structures, and (3) predict predicate-argument relations between the fragments. We use hierarchical PitmanYor processes to model statistical dependencies between meaning representations of predicates and those of their arguments, as well as the clusters of their syntactic realizations. We develop a modification of the MetropolisHastings split-merge sampler, resulting in an efficient inference algorithm for the model. The method is experimentally evaluated by us- ing the induced semantic representation for the question answering task in the biomedical domain.</p><p>6 0.10200808 <a title="15-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Probabilistic_Document_Modeling_for_Syntax_Removal_in_Text_Summarization.html">251 acl-2011-Probabilistic Document Modeling for Syntax Removal in Text Summarization</a></p>

We demonstrate that, for a large class of words, IBM Model 1 is indifferent among a continuum of ways to allocate probability mass to their translations. We study the magnitude of the variance in optimal model parameters using a linear programming approach as well as multiple random trials, and demonstrate that it results in variance in test set log-likelihood and alignment error rate.</p><p>4 0.64777678 <a title="15-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-A_Large_Scale_Distributed_Syntactic%2C_Semantic_and_Lexical_Language_Model_for_Machine_Translation.html">17 acl-2011-A Large Scale Distributed Syntactic, Semantic and Lexical Language Model for Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Yves Petinot ; Kathleen McKeown ; Kapil Thadani</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the relevance of hierarchical topic models to represent the content of Web gists. We focus our attention on DMOZ, a popular Web directory, and propose two algorithms to infer such a model from its manually-curated hierarchy of categories. Our first approach, based on information-theoretic grounds, uses an algorithm similar to recursive feature selection. Our second approach is fully Bayesian and derived from the more general model, hierarchical LDA. We evaluate the performance of both models against a flat 1-gram baseline and show improvements in terms of perplexity over held-out data.</p><p>6 0.60726118 <a title="15-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Simple_Unsupervised_Grammar_Induction_from_Raw_Text_with_Cascaded_Finite_State_Models.html">284 acl-2011-Simple Unsupervised Grammar Induction from Raw Text with Cascaded Finite State Models</a></p>

These new modules are added to a discriminative bootstrapping algorithm to realize topic feature generation, negative example selection and entity candidate pruning. In this study, we model latent topics with LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) in an unsupervised way.

<p>Author: Yee Seng Chan ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we observe that there exists a second dimension to the relation extraction (RE) problem that is orthogonal to the relation type dimension. We show that most of these second dimensional structures are relatively constrained and not difficult to identify. We propose a novel algorithmic approach to RE that starts by first identifying these structures and then, within these, identifying the semantic type of the relation. In the real RE problem where relation arguments need to be identified, exploiting these structures also allows reducing pipelined propagated errors. We show that this RE framework provides significant improvement in RE performance.</p><p>5 0.93759686 <a title="15-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Multi-Modal_Annotation_of_Quest_Games_in_Second_Life.html">226 acl-2011-Multi-Modal Annotation of Quest Games in Second Life</a></p>
<p>Author: Sharon Gower Small ; Jennifer Strommer-Galley ; Tomek Strzalkowski</p><p>Abstract: We describe an annotation tool developed to assist in the creation of multimodal actioncommunication corpora from on-line massively multi-player games, or MMGs. MMGs typically involve groups of players (5-30) who control their perform various activities (questing, competing, fighting, etc.) and communicate via chat or speech using assumed screen names. We collected a corpus of 48 group quests in Second Life that jointly involved 206 players who generated over 30,000 messages in quasisynchronous chat during approximately 140 hours of recorded action. Multiple levels of coordinated annotation of this corpus (dialogue, movements, touch, gaze, wear, etc) are required in order to support development of automated predictors of selected real-life social and demographic characteristics of the players. The annotation tool presented in this paper was developed to enable efficient and accurate annotation of all dimensions simultaneously. avatars1, 1</p><p>6 0.92329037 <a title="15-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-In-domain_Relation_Discovery_with_Meta-constraints_via_Posterior_Regularization.html">170 acl-2011-In-domain Relation Discovery with Meta-constraints via Posterior Regularization</a></p>

<p>Author: Dipanjan Das ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We describe a new approach to disambiguating semantic frames evoked by lexical predicates previously unseen in a lexicon or annotated data. Our approach makes use of large amounts of unlabeled data in a graph-based semi-supervised learning framework. We construct a large graph where vertices correspond to potential predicates and use label propagation to learn possible semantic frames for new ones. The label-propagated graph is used within a frame-semantic parser and, for unknown predicates, results in over 15% absolute improvement in frame identification accuracy and over 13% absolute improvement in full frame-semantic parsing F1 score on a blind test set, over a state-of-the-art supervised baseline.</p><p>3 0.095330618 <a title="84-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-A_Bayesian_Model_for_Unsupervised_Semantic_Parsing.html">3 acl-2011-A Bayesian Model for Unsupervised Semantic Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Ivan Titov ; Alexandre Klementiev</p><p>Abstract: We propose a non-parametric Bayesian model for unsupervised semantic parsing. Following Poon and Domingos (2009), we consider a semantic parsing setting where the goal is to (1) decompose the syntactic dependency tree of a sentence into fragments, (2) assign each of these fragments to a cluster of semantically equivalent syntactic structures, and (3) predict predicate-argument relations between the fragments. We use hierarchical PitmanYor processes to model statistical dependencies between meaning representations of predicates and those of their arguments, as well as the clusters of their syntactic realizations. We develop a modification of the MetropolisHastings split-merge sampler, resulting in an efficient inference algorithm for the model. The method is experimentally evaluated by us- ing the induced semantic representation for the question answering task in the biomedical domain.</p><p>4 0.09114439 <a title="84-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Towards_Style_Transformation_from_Written-Style_to_Audio-Style.html">306 acl-2011-Towards Style Transformation from Written-Style to Audio-Style</a></p>

We study the differences between the written style and the audio style by consulting the linguistics andjour- nalism literatures. Guided by this study, we suggest a number of linguistic features to distinguish between the two styles. We show the correctness of our features and the impact of style transformation on the user experience through statistical analysis, a style classification task, and a user study.</p><p>5 0.083534285 <a title="84-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Lost_in_Translation%3A_Authorship_Attribution_using_Frame_Semantics.html">214 acl-2011-Lost in Translation: Authorship Attribution using Frame Semantics</a></p>

To date Ihave defined a comprehensive set of social events and built a preliminary system that extracts social events from news articles. Iplan to improve the performance of my current system by incorporating semantic information. Using domain adaptation techniques, Ipropose to apply my system to a wide range of genres. By extracting linguistic constructs relevant to social interactions, I will be able to empirically analyze different kinds of linguistic constructs that people use to express social interactions. Lastly, I will attempt to make convolution kernels more scalable and interpretable.</p><p>4 0.59681284 <a title="84-lsi-4" href="./acl-2011-Lost_in_Translation%3A_Authorship_Attribution_using_Frame_Semantics.html">214 acl-2011-Lost in Translation: Authorship Attribution using Frame Semantics</a></p>

<p>Author: Vicent Alabau ; Alberto Sanchis ; Francisco Casacuberta</p><p>Abstract: In interactive machine translation (IMT), a human expert is integrated into the core of a machine translation (MT) system. The human expert interacts with the IMT system by partially correcting the errors of the system’s output. Then, the system proposes a new solution. This process is repeated until the output meets the desired quality. In this scenario, the interaction is typically performed using the keyboard and the mouse. In this work, we present an alternative modality to interact within IMT systems by writing on a tactile display or using an electronic pen. An on-line handwritten text recognition (HTR) system has been specifically designed to operate with IMT systems. Our HTR system improves previous approaches in two main aspects. First, HTR decoding is tightly coupled with the IMT system. Second, the language models proposed are context aware, in the sense that they take into account the partial corrections and the source sentence by using a combination of ngrams and word-based IBM models. The proposed system achieves an important boost in performance with respect to previous work.</p><p>2 0.774113 <a title="84-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-An_Interactive_Machine_Translation_System_with_Online_Learning.html">41 acl-2011-An Interactive Machine Translation System with Online Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Ortiz-Martinez ; Luis A. Leiva ; Vicent Alabau ; Ismael Garcia-Varea ; Francisco Casacuberta</p><p>Abstract: State-of-the-art Machine Translation (MT) systems are still far from being perfect. An alternative is the so-called Interactive Machine Translation (IMT) framework, where the knowledge of a human translator is combined with the MT system. We present a statistical IMT system able to learn from user feedback by means of the application of online learning techniques. These techniques allow the MT system to update the parameters of the underlying models in real time. According to empirical results, our system outperforms the results of conventional IMT systems. To the best of our knowledge, this online learning capability has never been provided by previous IMT systems. Our IMT system is implemented in C++, JavaScript, and ActionScript; and is publicly available on the Web.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.73898089 <a title="84-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Contrasting_Opposing_Views_of_News_Articles_on_Contentious_Issues.html">84 acl-2011-Contrasting Opposing Views of News Articles on Contentious Issues</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuval Marton ; Nizar Habash ; Owen Rambow</p><p>Abstract: We explore the contribution of morphological features both lexical and inflectional to dependency parsing of Arabic, a morphologically rich language. Using controlled experiments, we find that definiteness, person, number, gender, and the undiacritzed lemma are most helpful for parsing on automatically tagged input. We further contrast the contribution of form-based and functional features, and show that functional gender and number (e.g., “broken plurals”) and the related rationality feature improve over form-based features. It is the first time functional morphological features are used for Arabic NLP. – –</p><p>5 0.69706857 <a title="84-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-P11-2093_k2opt.pdf.html">238 acl-2011-P11-2093 k2opt.pdf</a></p>

Despite the lack of structure, it is able to outperform the current state-of-the-art structured approach for Japanese MA, and achieves accuracy similar to that of structured predictors using the same feature set. We also find that the method is both robust to outof-domain data, and can be easily adapted through the use of a combination of partial annotation and active learning.</p><p>6 0.61206913 <a title="84-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Prototyping_virtual_instructors_from_human-human_corpora.html">252 acl-2011-Prototyping virtual instructors from human-human corpora</a></p>

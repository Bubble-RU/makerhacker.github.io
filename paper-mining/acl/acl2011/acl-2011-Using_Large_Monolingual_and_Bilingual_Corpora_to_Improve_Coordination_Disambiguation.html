<p>Author: Mohit Bansal ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Counts from large corpora (like the web) can be powerful syntactic cues. Past work has used web counts to help resolve isolated ambiguities, such as binary noun-verb PP attachments and noun compound bracketings. In this work, we first present a method for generating web count features that address the full range of syntactic attachments. These features encode both surface evidence of lexical affinities as well as paraphrase-based cues to syntactic structure. We then integrate our features into full-scale dependency and constituent parsers. We show relative error reductions of7.0% over the second-order dependency parser of McDonald and Pereira (2006), 9.2% over the constituent parser of Petrov et al. (2006), and 3.4% over a non-local constituent reranker.</p><p>3 0.16992337 <a title="331-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Exploiting_Web-Derived_Selectional_Preference_to_Improve_Statistical_Dependency_Parsing.html">127 acl-2011-Exploiting Web-Derived Selectional Preference to Improve Statistical Dependency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Guangyou Zhou ; Jun Zhao ; Kang Liu ; Li Cai</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach which incorporates the web-derived selectional preferences to improve statistical dependency parsing. Conventional selectional preference learning methods have usually focused on word-to-class relations, e.g., a verb selects as its subject a given nominal class. This paper extends previous work to wordto-word selectional preferences by using webscale data. Experiments show that web-scale data improves statistical dependency parsing, particularly for long dependency relationships. There is no data like more data, performance improves log-linearly with the number of parameters (unique N-grams). More importantly, when operating on new domains, we show that using web-derived selectional preferences is essential for achieving robust performance.</p><p>4 0.16814664 <a title="331-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Joint_Bilingual_Sentiment_Classification_with_Unlabeled_Parallel_Corpora.html">183 acl-2011-Joint Bilingual Sentiment Classification with Unlabeled Parallel Corpora</a></p>
<p>Author: Bin Lu ; Chenhao Tan ; Claire Cardie ; Benjamin K. Tsou</p><p>Abstract: Most previous work on multilingual sentiment analysis has focused on methods to adapt sentiment resources from resource-rich languages to resource-poor languages. We present a novel approach for joint bilingual sentiment classification at the sentence level that augments available labeled data in each language with unlabeled parallel data. We rely on the intuition that the sentiment labels for parallel sentences should be similar and present a model that jointly learns improved monolingual sentiment classifiers for each language. Experiments on multiple data sets show that the proposed approach (1) outperforms the monolingual baselines, significantly improving the accuracy for both languages by 3.44%-8. 12%; (2) outperforms two standard approaches for leveraging unlabeled data; and (3) produces (albeit smaller) performance gains when employing pseudo-parallel data from machine translation engines. 1</p><p>5 0.16555265 <a title="331-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Effects_of_Noun_Phrase_Bracketing_in_Dependency_Parsing_and_Machine_Translation.html">111 acl-2011-Effects of Noun Phrase Bracketing in Dependency Parsing and Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathan Green</p><p>Abstract: Flat noun phrase structure was, up until recently, the standard in annotation for the Penn Treebanks. With the recent addition of internal noun phrase annotation, dependency parsing and applications down the NLP pipeline are likely affected. Some machine translation systems, such as TectoMT, use deep syntax as a language transfer layer. It is proposed that changes to the noun phrase dependency parse will have a cascading effect down the NLP pipeline and in the end, improve machine translation output, even with a reduction in parser accuracy that the noun phrase structure might cause. This paper examines this noun phrase structure’s effect on dependency parsing, in English, with a maximum spanning tree parser and shows a 2.43%, 0.23 Bleu score, improvement for English to Czech machine translation. .</p><p>6 0.14565198 <a title="331-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Using_Bilingual_Parallel_Corpora_for_Cross-Lingual_Textual_Entailment.html">327 acl-2011-Using Bilingual Parallel Corpora for Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment</a></p>

<p>Author: Dipanjan Das ; Slav Petrov</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel approach for inducing unsupervised part-of-speech taggers for languages that have no labeled training data, but have translated text in a resource-rich language. Our method does not assume any knowledge about the target language (in particular no tagging dictionary is assumed), making it applicable to a wide array of resource-poor languages. We use graph-based label propagation for cross-lingual knowledge transfer and use the projected labels as features in an unsupervised model (BergKirkpatrick et al., 2010). Across eight European languages, our approach results in an average absolute improvement of 10.4% over a state-of-the-art baseline, and 16.7% over vanilla hidden Markov models induced with the Expectation Maximization algorithm.</p><p>5 0.64712983 <a title="331-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-That%27s_What_She_Said%3A_Double_Entendre_Identification.html">297 acl-2011-That's What She Said: Double Entendre Identification</a></p>

We identify a subproblem — the “that’s what she said” problem with two distinguishing characteristics: (1) use of nouns that are euphemisms for sexually explicit nouns and (2) structure common in the erotic domain. We address this problem in a classification approach that includes features that model those two characteristics. Experiments on web data demonstrate that our approach improves precision by 12% over baseline techniques that use only word-based features. —</p><p>6 0.61011356 <a title="331-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-I_Thou_Thee%2C_Thou_Traitor%3A_Predicting_Formal_vs._Informal_Address_in_English_Literature.html">157 acl-2011-I Thou Thee, Thou Traitor: Predicting Formal vs. Informal Address in English Literature</a></p>

<p>Author: Wei-Bin Liang ; Chung-Hsien Wu ; Chia-Ping Chen</p><p>Abstract: In this study, a novel approach to robust dialogue act detection for error-prone speech recognition in a spoken dialogue system is proposed. First, partial sentence trees are proposed to represent a speech recognition output sentence. Semantic information and the derivation rules of the partial sentence trees are extracted and used to model the relationship between the dialogue acts and the derivation rules. The constructed model is then used to generate a semantic score for dialogue act detection given an input speech utterance. The proposed approach is implemented and evaluated in a Mandarin spoken dialogue system for tour-guiding service. Combined with scores derived from the ASR recognition probability and the dialogue history, the proposed approach achieves 84.3% detection accuracy, an absolute improvement of 34.7% over the baseline of the semantic slot-based method with 49.6% detection accuracy.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.77687806 <a title="331-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Using_Large_Monolingual_and_Bilingual_Corpora_to_Improve_Coordination_Disambiguation.html">331 acl-2011-Using Large Monolingual and Bilingual Corpora to Improve Coordination Disambiguation</a></p>

This paper looks at coordination disambiguation in complex noun phrases (NPs). Parsers trained on the Penn Treebank are reporting impressive numbers these days, but they don’t do very well on this problem (79%). We explore systems trained using three types of corpora: (1) annotated (e.g. the Penn Treebank), (2) bitexts (e.g. Europarl), and (3) unannotated monolingual (e.g. Google N-grams). Size matters: (1) is a million words, (2) is potentially billions of words and (3) is potentially trillions of words. The unannotated monolingual data is helpful when the ambiguity can be resolved through associations among the lexical items. The bilingual data is helpful when the ambiguity can be resolved by the order of words in the translation. We train separate classifiers with monolingual and bilingual features and iteratively improve them via achieves data and pervised tations. co-training. The co-trained classifier close to 96% accuracy on Treebank makes 20% fewer errors than a susystem trained with Treebank anno-</p><p>4 0.74172616 <a title="331-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Monolingual_Alignment_by_Edit_Rate_Computation_on_Sentential_Paraphrase_Pairs.html">225 acl-2011-Monolingual Alignment by Edit Rate Computation on Sentential Paraphrase Pairs</a></p>
<p>Author: Houda Bouamor ; Aurelien Max ; Anne Vilnat</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel way of tackling the monolingual alignment problem on pairs of sentential paraphrases by means of edit rate computation. In order to inform the edit rate, information in the form of subsentential paraphrases is provided by a range of techniques built for different purposes. We show that the tunable TER-PLUS metric from Machine Translation evaluation can achieve good performance on this task and that it can effectively exploit information coming from complementary sources.</p><p>5 0.69500059 <a title="331-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Joint_Bilingual_Sentiment_Classification_with_Unlabeled_Parallel_Corpora.html">183 acl-2011-Joint Bilingual Sentiment Classification with Unlabeled Parallel Corpora</a></p>
<p>Author: Bin Lu ; Chenhao Tan ; Claire Cardie ; Benjamin K. Tsou</p><p>Abstract: Most previous work on multilingual sentiment analysis has focused on methods to adapt sentiment resources from resource-rich languages to resource-poor languages. We present a novel approach for joint bilingual sentiment classification at the sentence level that augments available labeled data in each language with unlabeled parallel data. We rely on the intuition that the sentiment labels for parallel sentences should be similar and present a model that jointly learns improved monolingual sentiment classifiers for each language. Experiments on multiple data sets show that the proposed approach (1) outperforms the monolingual baselines, significantly improving the accuracy for both languages by 3.44%-8. 12%; (2) outperforms two standard approaches for leveraging unlabeled data; and (3) produces (albeit smaller) performance gains when employing pseudo-parallel data from machine translation engines. 1</p><p>6 0.68910593 <a title="331-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Web-Scale_Features_for_Full-Scale_Parsing.html">333 acl-2011-Web-Scale Features for Full-Scale Parsing</a></p>

<h1>21 acl-2011-A Pilot Study of Opinion Summarization in Conversations</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2011-21-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P11/P11-1034.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Dong Wang ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a pilot study of opinion summarization on conversations. We create a corpus containing extractive and abstractive summaries of speaker’s opinion towards a given topic using 88 telephone conversations. We adopt two methods to perform extractive summarization. The first one is a sentence-ranking method that linearly combines scores measured from different aspects including topic relevance, subjectivity, and sentence importance. The second one is a graph-based method, which incorporates topic and sentiment information, as well as additional information about sentence-to-sentence relations extracted based on dialogue structure. Our evaluation results show that both methods significantly outperform the baseline approach that extracts the longest utterances. In particular, we find that incorporating dialogue structure in the graph-based method contributes to the improved system performance.</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2011-32-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P11/P11-1093.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Alla Rozovskaya ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of correcting errors made by English as a Second Language (ESL) writers and address two issues that are essential to making progress in ESL error correction - algorithm selection and model adaptation to the first language of the ESL learner. A variety of learning algorithms have been applied to correct ESL mistakes, but often comparisons were made between incomparable data sets. We conduct an extensive, fair comparison of four popular learning methods for the task, reversing conclusions from earlier evaluations. Our results hold for different training sets, genres, and feature sets. A second key issue in ESL error correction is the adaptation of a model to the first language ofthe writer. Errors made by non-native speakers exhibit certain regularities and, as we show, models perform much better when they use knowledge about error patterns of the nonnative writers. We propose a novel way to adapt a learned algorithm to the first language of the writer that is both cheaper to implement and performs better than other adaptation methods.</p><br/>

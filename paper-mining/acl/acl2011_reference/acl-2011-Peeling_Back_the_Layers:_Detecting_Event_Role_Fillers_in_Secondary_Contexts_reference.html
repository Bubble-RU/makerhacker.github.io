<h1>244 acl-2011-Peeling Back the Layers: Detecting Event Role Fillers in Secondary Contexts</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2011-244-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P11/P11-1114.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Ruihong Huang ; Ellen Riloff</p><p>Abstract: The goal of our research is to improve event extraction by learning to identify secondary role filler contexts in the absence of event keywords. We propose a multilayered event extraction architecture that progressively “zooms in” on relevant information. Our extraction model includes a document genre classifier to recognize event narratives, two types of sentence classifiers, and noun phrase classifiers to extract role fillers. These modules are organized as a pipeline to gradually zero in on event-related information. We present results on the MUC-4 event extraction data set and show that this model performs better than previous systems.</p><br/>

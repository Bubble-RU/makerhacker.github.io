<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2011-51-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P11/P11-3021.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Fahad Alotaiby</p><p>Abstract: Arabic language is a morphologically complex language. Affixes and clitics are regularly attached to stems which make direct comparison between words not practical. In this paper we propose a new automatic headline generation technique that utilizes character cross-correlation to extract best headlines and to overcome the Arabic language complex morphology. The system that uses character cross-correlation achieves ROUGE-L score of 0. 19384 while the exact word matching scores only 0. 17252 for the same set of documents. 1</p><br/>

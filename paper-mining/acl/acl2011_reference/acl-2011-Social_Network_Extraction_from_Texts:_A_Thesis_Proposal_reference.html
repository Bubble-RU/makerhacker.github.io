<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2011-286-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P11/P11-3020.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Apoorv Agarwal</p><p>Abstract: In my thesis, Ipropose to build a system that would enable extraction of social interactions from texts. To date Ihave defined a comprehensive set of social events and built a preliminary system that extracts social events from news articles. Iplan to improve the performance of my current system by incorporating semantic information. Using domain adaptation techniques, Ipropose to apply my system to a wide range of genres. By extracting linguistic constructs relevant to social interactions, I will be able to empirically analyze different kinds of linguistic constructs that people use to express social interactions. Lastly, I will attempt to make convolution kernels more scalable and interpretable.</p><br/>

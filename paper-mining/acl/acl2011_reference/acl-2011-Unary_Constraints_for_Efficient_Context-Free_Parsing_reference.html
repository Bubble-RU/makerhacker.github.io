<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2011-316-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P11/P11-2119.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Nathan Bodenstab ; Kristy Hollingshead ; Brian Roark</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel pruning method for context-free parsing that increases efficiency by disallowing phrase-level unary productions in CKY chart cells spanning a single word. Our work is orthogonal to recent work on “closing” chart cells, which has focused on multi-word constituents, leaving span-1 chart cells unpruned. We show that a simple discriminative classifier can learn with high accuracy which span-1 chart cells to close to phrase-level unary productions. Eliminating these unary productions from the search can have a large impact on downstream processing, depending on implementation details of the search. We apply our method to four parsing architectures and demonstrate how it is complementary to the cell-closing paradigm, as well as other pruning methods such as coarse-to-fine, agenda, and beam-search pruning.</p><br/>

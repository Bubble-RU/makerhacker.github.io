<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2011-297-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P11/P11-2016.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Chloe Kiddon ; Yuriy Brun</p><p>Abstract: Humor identification is a hard natural language understanding problem. We identify a subproblem — the “that’s what she said” problem with two distinguishing characteristics: (1) use of nouns that are euphemisms for sexually explicit nouns and (2) structure common in the erotic domain. We address this problem in a classification approach that includes features that model those two characteristics. Experiments on web data demonstrate that our approach improves precision by 12% over baseline techniques that use only word-based features. —</p><br/>

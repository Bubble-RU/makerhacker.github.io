<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2011-245-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P11/P11-1066.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Guangyou Zhou ; Li Cai ; Jun Zhao ; Kang Liu</p><p>Abstract: Community-based question answer (Q&A;) has become an important issue due to the popularity of Q&A; archives on the web. This paper is concerned with the problem of question retrieval. Question retrieval in Q&A; archives aims to find historical questions that are semantically equivalent or relevant to the queried questions. In this paper, we propose a novel phrase-based translation model for question retrieval. Compared to the traditional word-based translation models, the phrasebased translation model is more effective because it captures contextual information in modeling the translation ofphrases as a whole, rather than translating single words in isolation. Experiments conducted on real Q&A; data demonstrate that our proposed phrasebased translation model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art word-based translation model.</p><br/>

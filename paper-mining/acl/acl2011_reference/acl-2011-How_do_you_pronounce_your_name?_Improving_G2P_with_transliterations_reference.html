<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2011-153-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P11/P11-1041.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Aditya Bhargava ; Grzegorz Kondrak</p><p>Abstract: Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P) of names is an important and challenging problem. The correct pronunciation of a name is often reflected in its transliterations, which are expressed within a different phonological inventory. We investigate the problem of using transliterations to correct errors produced by state-of-the-art G2P systems. We present a novel re-ranking approach that incorporates a variety of score and n-gram features, in order to leverage transliterations from multiple languages. Our experiments demonstrate significant accuracy improvements when re-ranking is applied to n-best lists generated by three different G2P programs.</p><br/>

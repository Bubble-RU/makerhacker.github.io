<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2011-131-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P11/P11-2018.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Richard Johansson ; Alessandro Moschitti</p><p>Abstract: We investigate systems that identify opinion expressions and assigns polarities to the extracted expressions. In particular, we demonstrate the benefit of integrating opinion extraction and polarity classification into a joint model using features reflecting the global polarity structure. The model is trained using large-margin structured prediction methods. The system is evaluated on the MPQA opinion corpus, where we compare it to the only previously published end-to-end system for opinion expression extraction and polarity classification. The results show an improvement of between 10 and 15 absolute points in F-measure.</p><br/>

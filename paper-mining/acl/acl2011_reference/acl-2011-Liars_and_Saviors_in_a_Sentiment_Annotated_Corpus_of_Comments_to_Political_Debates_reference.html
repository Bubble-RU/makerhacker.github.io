<h1>211 acl-2011-Liars and Saviors in a Sentiment Annotated Corpus of Comments to Political Debates</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2011-211-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P11/P11-2099.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Paula Carvalho ; Luis Sarmento ; Jorge Teixeira ; Mario J. Silva</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the expression of opinions about human entities in user-generated content (UGC). A set of 2,800 online news comments (8,000 sentences) was manually annotated, following a rich annotation scheme designed for this purpose. We conclude that the challenge in performing opinion mining in such type of content is correctly identifying the positive opinions, because (i) they are much less frequent than negative opinions and (ii) they are particularly exposed to verbal irony. We also show that the recognition of human targets poses additional challenges on mining opinions from UGC, since they are frequently mentioned by pronouns, definite descriptions and nicknames. 1</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2011-246-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P11/P11-1097.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Stefan Rud ; Massimiliano Ciaramita ; Jens Muller ; Hinrich Schutze</p><p>Abstract: We use search engine results to address a particularly difficult cross-domain language processing task, the adaptation of named entity recognition (NER) from news text to web queries. The key novelty of the method is that we submit a token with context to a search engine and use similar contexts in the search results as additional information for correctly classifying the token. We achieve strong gains in NER performance on news, in-domain and out-of-domain, and on web queries.</p><br/>

<h1>152 acl-2011-How Much Can We Gain from Supervised Word Alignment?</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2011-152-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P11/P11-2029.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Jinxi Xu ; Jinying Chen</p><p>Abstract: Word alignment is a central problem in statistical machine translation (SMT). In recent years, supervised alignment algorithms, which improve alignment accuracy by mimicking human alignment, have attracted a great deal of attention. The objective of this work is to explore the performance limit of supervised alignment under the current SMT paradigm. Our experiments used a manually aligned ChineseEnglish corpus with 280K words recently released by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). We treated the human alignment as the oracle of supervised alignment. The result is surprising: the gain of human alignment over a state of the art unsupervised method (GIZA++) is less than 1point in BLEU. Furthermore, we showed the benefit of improved alignment becomes smaller with more training data, implying the above limit also holds for large training conditions. 1</p><br/>

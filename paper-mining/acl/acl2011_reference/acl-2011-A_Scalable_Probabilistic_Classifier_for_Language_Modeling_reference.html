<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2011-24-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P11/P11-2110.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Joel Lang</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel probabilistic classifier, which scales well to problems that involve a large number ofclasses and require training on large datasets. A prominent example of such a problem is language modeling. Our classifier is based on the assumption that each feature is associated with a predictive strength, which quantifies how well the feature can predict the class by itself. The predictions of individual features can then be combined according to their predictive strength, resulting in a model, whose parameters can be reliably and efficiently estimated. We show that a generative language model based on our classifier consistently matches modified Kneser-Ney smoothing and can outperform it if sufficiently rich features are incorporated.</p><br/>

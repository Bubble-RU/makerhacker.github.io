<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2011-88-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P11/P11-1121.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Ryo Nagata ; Edward Whittaker ; Vera Sheinman</p><p>Abstract: The availability of learner corpora, especially those which have been manually error-tagged or shallow-parsed, is still limited. This means that researchers do not have a common development and test set for natural language processing of learner English such as for grammatical error detection. Given this background, we created a novel learner corpus that was manually error-tagged and shallowparsed. This corpus is available for research and educational purposes on the web. In this paper, we describe it in detail together with its data-collection method and annotation schemes. Another contribution of this paper is that we take the first step toward evaluating the performance of existing POStagging/chunking techniques on learner corpora using the created corpus. These contributions will facilitate further research in related areas such as grammatical error detection and automated essay scoring.</p><br/>

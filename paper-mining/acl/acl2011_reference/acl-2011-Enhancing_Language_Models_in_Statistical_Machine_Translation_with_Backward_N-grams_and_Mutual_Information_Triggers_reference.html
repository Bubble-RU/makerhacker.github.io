<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2011-116-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P11/P11-1129.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Deyi Xiong ; Min Zhang ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, with a belief that a language model that embraces a larger context provides better prediction ability, we present two extensions to standard n-gram language models in statistical machine translation: a backward language model that augments the conventional forward language model, and a mutual information trigger model which captures long-distance dependencies that go beyond the scope of standard n-gram language models. We integrate the two proposed models into phrase-based statistical machine translation and conduct experiments on large-scale training data to investigate their effectiveness. Our experimental results show that both models are able to significantly improve transla- , tion quality and collectively achieve up to 1 BLEU point over a competitive baseline.</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2011-157-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P11/P11-2082.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Manaal Faruqui ; Sebastian Pado</p><p>Abstract: In contrast to many languages (like Russian or French), modern English does not distinguish formal and informal (“T/V”) address overtly, for example by pronoun choice. We describe an ongoing study which investigates to what degree the T/V distinction is recoverable in English text, and with what textual features it correlates. Our findings are: (a) human raters can label English utterances as T or V fairly well, given sufficient context; (b), lexical cues can predict T/V almost at human level.</p><br/>

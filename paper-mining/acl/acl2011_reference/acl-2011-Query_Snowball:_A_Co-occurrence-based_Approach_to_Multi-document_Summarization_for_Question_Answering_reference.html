<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2011-255-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P11/P11-2039.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Hajime Morita ; Tetsuya Sakai ; Manabu Okumura</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new method for query-oriented extractive multi-document summarization. To enrich the information need representation of a given query, we build a co-occurrence graph to obtain words that augment the original query terms. We then formulate the summarization problem as a Maximum Coverage Problem with Knapsack Constraints based on word pairs rather than single words. Our experiments with the NTCIR ACLIA question answering test collections show that our method achieves a pyramid F3-score of up to 0.3 13, a 36% improvement over a baseline using Maximal Marginal Relevance. 1</p><br/>

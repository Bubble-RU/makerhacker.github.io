<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2011-264-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P11/P11-1103.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Alexandra Birch ; Miles Osborne</p><p>Abstract: One of the major challenges facing statistical machine translation is how to model differences in word order between languages. Although a great deal of research has focussed on this problem, progress is hampered by the lack of reliable metrics. Most current metrics are based on matching lexical items in the translation and the reference, and their ability to measure the quality of word order has not been demonstrated. This paper presents a novel metric, the LRscore, which explicitly measures the quality of word order by using permutation distance metrics. We show that the metric is more consistent with human judgements than other metrics, including the BLEU score. We also show that the LRscore can successfully be used as the objective function when training translation model parameters. Training with the LRscore leads to output which is preferred by humans. Moreover, the translations incur no penalty in terms of BLEU scores.</p><br/>

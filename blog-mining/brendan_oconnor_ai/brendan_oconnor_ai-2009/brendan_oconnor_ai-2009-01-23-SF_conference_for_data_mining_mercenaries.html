<p>Introduction: Today I received my copy of  Beautiful Data , a just-released anthology of articles about, well, working with data.   Lukas  and I contributed a chapter on analyzing social perceptions in web data.   See it here.  After a long process of drafting, proofreading, re-drafting, and bothering the publishers under rather sudden deadlines, I’ve resolved to never use graphics again in anything I write :)
 
Here’s our final figure, a  k-means  clustering of face photos via perceived social attributes (social  concepts/types ? with  exemplars ?): 
   
 
I just started reading the rest of the book and it’s very fun.   Peter Norvig ‘s chapter on language models is gripping.  (It does word segmentation, ciphers, and more, in that lovely python-centric tutorial style extending his previous  spell correction article .)  There are also chapters by many other great researchers and practitioners (some of whom you may have seen around this blog or its neighborhood) like  Andrew Gelman ,  Hadley Wickham ,</p><p>3 0.12395906 <a title="133-tfidf-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-12-03-Statistics_vs._Machine_Learning%2C_fight%21.html">129 brendan oconnor ai-2008-12-03-Statistics vs. Machine Learning, fight!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: Larry Wasserman has a new position paper (forthcoming 2013) with a great comparison the Statistics and Machine Learning research cultures,  “Rise of the Machines” .  He has a very conciliatory view in terms of intellectual content, and a very pro-ML take on the research cultures.  Central to his argument is that ML has recently adopted rigorous statistical concepts, and the fast-moving conference culture (and heavy publishing by its grad students) have helped with this and other good innovations.  (I agree with a comment from Sinead that he’s going a little easy on ML, but it’s certainly worth a read.)
 
There’s now a little history of “Statistics vs Machine Learning” position papers that this can be compared to.  A classic is Leo Breiman (2001),  “Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures” , which isn’t exactly about stats vs. ML, but is about the focus on modeling vs algorithms, and maybe about description vs. prediction.

<p>Introduction: A language model’s  perplexity  is exponentiated negative average log-likelihood,
 
$$\exp( -\frac{1}{N} \log(p(x)))$$
 
Where the inner term usually decomposes into a sum over individual items; for example, as \(\sum_i \log p(x_i | x_1..x_{i-1})\) or \(\sum_i \log p(x_i)\) depending on independence assumptions, where for language modeling word tokens are usually taken as the individual units.  (In which case it is the geometric mean of per-token negative log-likelihoods.)   It’s equivalent to exponentiated cross-entropy between the model and the empirical data distribution, since \(-1/N \sum_i^N \log p(x_i) = -\sum_k^K \hat{p}_k \log p_k = H(\hat{p};p)\) where \(N\) is the number of items and \(K\) is the number of discrete classes (e.g. word types for language modeling) and \(\hat{p}_k\) is the proportion of data having class \(k\).
 
A nice interpretation of any exponentiated entropy measure is as branching factor: entropy measures uncertainty in bits or nats, but in exponentiated f</p><p>same-blog 2 0.8936516 <a title="133-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-01-23-SF_conference_for_data_mining_mercenaries.html">133 brendan oconnor ai-2009-01-23-SF conference for data mining mercenaries</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I got an email from a promoter for  Predictive Analytics World , a very expensive conference next month in San Francisco for business applications of data mining / machine learning / predictive analytics.  I’m not going because I don’t want to spend $1600 of my own money, but it looks like it has a good lineup and all (Andreas Weigend, Netflix BellKor folks, case studies from interesting companies like Linden Labs, etc.).  If you’re a cs/statistics person and want a job, this is probably a good place to meet people.  If you’re a businessman and want to hire one, this is probably a bad event since it’s too damn expensive for grad school types.  I am supposed to have access to a promotional code for a 15% discount, so email me if you want such a thing.
 
John Langford posted a  very interesting email interview  with one of the organizers for the event, about how machine learning gets applied in the real world.  The guy seemed to think that data integration — getting all the data out of d</p><p>3 0.34783068 <a title="133-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-12-03-Statistics_vs._Machine_Learning%2C_fight%21.html">129 brendan oconnor ai-2008-12-03-Statistics vs. Machine Learning, fight!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: At some point, I put extra email addresses on Facebook because I thought it was necessary for something, but didn’t want to show them, so in the privacy settings marked their visibility as “Only Me.”  It turns out that right now, Facebook is blatantly ignoring that privacy setting, and instead showing them to the world.
 
Here are my settings:
 
   
 
Here is a fragment of my profile, viewed from a friend’s account half an hour ago:
 
   
 
I would complain to their customer service, but I can’t find a link from their  Help Center  page.
 
Obviously, this particular issue is a very minor concern for me.  But it hardly instills faith in the system — especially considering that privacy bugs are ones that the affected user, almost by definition, can’t see.  I’ve also had other weird issues where changes to privacy settings don’t seem to stick when I save then later go back to the page.  It’s annoying and hard to verify these things — which is why important  “social utilities”  like Facebo</p><p>5 0.31506062 <a title="133-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-11-12-Disease_tracking_with_web_queries_and_social_messaging_%28Google%2C_Twitter%2C_Facebook%E2%80%A6%29.html">123 brendan oconnor ai-2008-11-12-Disease tracking with web queries and social messaging (Google, Twitter, Facebook…)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a good idea: in a search engine’s query logs, look for outbreaks of queries like [[flu symptoms]] in a given region.  I’ve heard (from  Roddy ) that this trick also works well on Facebook statuses (e.g. “Feeling crappy this morning, think I just got the flu”).
  
  Google Uses Web Searches to Track Flu’s Spread – NYTimes.com  
  Google Flu Trends – google.org  
  
For an example with a publicly available data feed, these queries works decently well on Twitter search:
 
 [[ flu -shot -google ]]  (high recall)
 
 [[ "muscle aches" flu -shot ]]  (high precision)
     
 
The “muscle aches” query is too sparse and the general query is too noisy, but you could imagine some more tricks to clean it up, then train a classifier, etc.  With a bit more work it looks like geolocation information can be had out of the  Twitter search API .</p><p>6 0.31379619 <a title="133-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2012/brendan_oconnor_ai-2012-10-02-Powerset%E2%80%99s_natural_language_search_system.html">188 brendan oconnor ai-2012-10-02-Powerset’s natural language search system</a></p>

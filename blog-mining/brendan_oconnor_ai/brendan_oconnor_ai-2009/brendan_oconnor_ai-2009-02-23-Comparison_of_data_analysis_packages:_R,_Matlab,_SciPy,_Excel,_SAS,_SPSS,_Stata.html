<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: When possible, I like to use R for its really, really good statistical visualization capabilities.  I’m doing a modeling project in Python right now (R is too slow, bad at large data, bad at structured data, etc.), and in comparison to base R, the matplotlib library is just painful.  I wrote a toy  Metropolis  sampler for a  triangle distribution  and all I want to see is whether it looks like it’s working.  For the same dataset, here are histograms with default settings.  (Python:  pylab.hist(d) , R:  hist(d) )
 
   
 
I want to know whether my Metropolis sampler is working; those two plots give a very different idea.  Of course, you could say this is an unfair comparison, since matplotlib is only using 10 bins, while R is using 18 here — and it’s always important to vary the bin size a few times when looking at histograms.  But R’s defaults really are better: it actually uses an adaptive bin size, and the heuristic worked, choosing a reasonable number for the data.

  "OMG OMG,  R  is now famous?!",

This blog has been a long-time supporter of this both brilliant and insanely quirky statistical programming environment.  Here are some graphs I’ve made in the last year or two that have R code attached:
  
  Wisdom of small crowds  
  Simpson’s paradox via mosaic plots  
  Dolores Labs color wheel!  ( code ) 
  Political bias SVD evaluation  
  Presidential poll aggregation  
 OK, we didn’t post the code, but check out our  N-body trolley graph !

<p>Introduction: update 2012-10-25 : I’ve been informed there is a new maintainer for Mawk, who has probably fixed the bugs I’ve been seeing.
  

From: Gert Hulselmans   


[The bugs you have found are] indeed true with mawk v1.3.3 which comes standard with Debian/Ubuntu.  This version is almost not developed the last 10 years.


I now already use mawk v1.3.4 maintained by another developer (Thomas E. Dickey) 
for more than a year on huge datafiles (sometimes several GB).


The problems/wrong results I had with mawk v1.3.3 sometimes are gone. In his version, normally all open/known bugs are fixed.


This version can be downloaded from:  http://invisible-island.net/mawk/ 

     update 2010-04-30  : I have since found large datasets where mawk is buggy and gives the wrong result.  nawk seems safe.   When one of these newfangled   “Big Data”   sets comes your way, the very first thing you have to do is data munging: shuffling around file formats, renaming fields and the like.

<p>Introduction: I’m doing  word and bigram counts  on a corpus of tweets.  I want to store and rapidly retrieve them later for  language model  purposes.  So there’s a big table of counts that get incremented many times.  The easiest way to get something running is to use an open-source key/value store; but which?  There’s recently been some development in this area so I thought it would be good to revisit and evaluate some options.
 
Here are timings for a single counting process: iterate over 45,000 short text messages, tokenize them, then increment counters for their unigrams and bigrams.  (The speed of the data store is only one component of performance.)  There are about 17 increments per tweet: 400k unique terms and 750k total count.  This is substantially smaller than what I need, but it’s small enough to easily test.  I used several very different architectures and packages, explained below.

<p>Introduction: update 2012-10-25 : I’ve been informed there is a new maintainer for Mawk, who has probably fixed the bugs I’ve been seeing.
  

From: Gert Hulselmans   


[The bugs you have found are] indeed true with mawk v1.3.3 which comes standard with Debian/Ubuntu.  This version is almost not developed the last 10 years.


I now already use mawk v1.3.4 maintained by another developer (Thomas E. Dickey) 
for more than a year on huge datafiles (sometimes several GB).


The problems/wrong results I had with mawk v1.3.3 sometimes are gone. In his version, normally all open/known bugs are fixed.


This version can be downloaded from:  http://invisible-island.net/mawk/ 

     update 2010-04-30  : I have since found large datasets where mawk is buggy and gives the wrong result.  nawk seems safe.   When one of these newfangled   “Big Data”   sets comes your way, the very first thing you have to do is data munging: shuffling around file formats, renaming fields and the like.

<p>Introduction: This has to be the most quick-and-dirty data visualizer out there: I wrote an ascii art plotter script that takes a column of numbers on stdin and throws out a plot on your console.  I’ve been using it for several months to quickly look at numbers on the commandline, especially from logs and such.  (Back in school I would use gnuplot for this; R is good too.  But sometimes you want to move really fast, esp if you have a few hideous perl -pe one-liners on your hands and mucking around with temp files will interrupt your flow.)

<p>Introduction: From a graphics/mod programming workshop,  modifications of “Breakout”  in awesome video form:
 
          
 
It uses  Processing , a framework designed for animation and graphicky things.  It was also used for the  Similar Diversity  visualization that maps out named entities and their common verbs across religious texts.  It’s pretty cool:     … so a name gets bigger with its frequency, I get that; but what governs the size of an arc connecting two names?  They say “common activities” — I’m guessing a distance measure on the terms in the contexts in which they appear?  I’d be most interested in a graph of their explicit interactions; something like a count of co-occurrences in a proximity window (word radius? verse? chapter? book?) might do the trick…

<p>Introduction: What a project — an impressively painstaking compilation of  20th century civilian and military casualties .  Summary: lots of people were killed.  Interesting are  the comments on morality and how prejudgement leads to differing casualty estimations  — estimates vary wildly for controversial regimes, like Castro’s Cuba (I’ve heard lots about), but are suspiciously round and agreed-upon for incidents that scholars seem to care less about, like the Congo Crisis of the 1960′s (I’ve heard not so much about.)</p><p>3 0.94671631 <a title="135-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-04-22-Performance_comparison%3A_key-value_stores_for_language_model_counts.html">139 brendan oconnor ai-2009-04-22-Performance comparison: key-value stores for language model counts</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m doing  word and bigram counts  on a corpus of tweets.  I want to store and rapidly retrieve them later for  language model  purposes.  So there’s a big table of counts that get incremented many times.  The easiest way to get something running is to use an open-source key/value store; but which?  There’s recently been some development in this area so I thought it would be good to revisit and evaluate some options.
 
Here are timings for a single counting process: iterate over 45,000 short text messages, tokenize them, then increment counters for their unigrams and bigrams.  (The speed of the data store is only one component of performance.)  There are about 17 increments per tweet: 400k unique terms and 750k total count.  This is substantially smaller than what I need, but it’s small enough to easily test.  I used several very different architectures and packages, explained below.

<p>Introduction: Lukas  and I were trying to write a succinct comparison of the most popular packages that are typically used for data analysis.  I think most people choose one based on what people around them use or what they learn in school, so I’ve found it hard to find comparative information.  I’m posting the table here in hopes of useful comments.

<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

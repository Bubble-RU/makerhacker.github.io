<p>Introduction: I got an email from a promoter for  Predictive Analytics World , a very expensive conference next month in San Francisco for business applications of data mining / machine learning / predictive analytics.  I’m not going because I don’t want to spend $1600 of my own money, but it looks like it has a good lineup and all (Andreas Weigend, Netflix BellKor folks, case studies from interesting companies like Linden Labs, etc.).  If you’re a cs/statistics person and want a job, this is probably a good place to meet people.  If you’re a businessman and want to hire one, this is probably a bad event since it’s too damn expensive for grad school types.  I am supposed to have access to a promotional code for a 15% discount, so email me if you want such a thing.

<p>Introduction: I saw  Seth Roberts  briefly speak today (at an  odd event ) about self-experimentation.  He tried drinking flavorless sugar water and it led him to lose lots of weight.  He also did a great variety of other self-experiments over more than a decade,  written up here  (and IMHO the other ones are much more interesting).
 
I briefly spoke to him there and told him I heard about his work from  Andrew Gelman’s blog .  He seemed surprised to (semi-)randomly meet someone who reads it.  I think this is mistaken — that particular blog seems quite popular in statistics/social science world.  In fact, Gelman’s blogging of Roberts’ self-experimentation paper got picked up by the Freakonomics folks and it became a sensation and then a book deal.  ( Story. )
 
Also note, John Langford says of his own  machine learning blog :

<p>Introduction: Wow, this is pretty cool:
 
 
 
From an  Andrew Gelman article  on summaring a linear regression as a simple difference between upper and lower categories.  I get the impression there are lots of weird misunderstood corners of linear models… (e.g. that “least squares regression” is a maximum likelihood estimator for a linear model with normal noise… I know so many people who didn’t learn that from their stats whatever course, and therefore find it mystifying why squared error should be used…  see this  other post from Gelman .)</p><p>5 0.075929761 <a title="151-tfidf-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2010/brendan_oconnor_ai-2010-08-09-An_ML-AI_approach_to_P_%21%3D_NP.html">161 brendan oconnor ai-2010-08-09-An ML-AI approach to P != NP</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Like everyone, I’ve been just starting to look at the new, tentative,  proof that P != NP  from Vinay Deolalikar.  After reading the intro, what’s most striking is that probabilistic graphical models and mathematical logic are at the core of the proof.  This feels like a machine learning and artificial intelligence-centric approach to me — very different from what you usually see in mainstream CS theory.  (Maybe I should feel good that in my undergrad I basically stopped studying normal math and spent all my time with this weird stuff instead!)
 
He devotes several chapters to an introduction to graphical models — Ising models, conditional independence, MRF’s, Hammersley-Clifford, and all that other stuff you see in  Koller and Friedman  or something — and then logic and model theory!  I’m impressed.</p><p>6 0.072693236 <a title="151-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2004/brendan_oconnor_ai-2004-11-24-addiction_%26_2_problems_of_economics.html">2 brendan oconnor ai-2004-11-24-addiction & 2 problems of economics</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is my idea based off of  Bernheim and Rangel’s  model of addict decision-making .  It’s a really neat model; it manages to relax rationality to allow someone to do something they don’t want to do because they’re addicted to it.  [Rationality assumes a nice well-ordered set of preferences; this model hypothesizes as distinction between emotional "liking" and cognitive, forward "wanting" that can conflict.]  The model is mathematically tractable, it can be used for public welfare analysis, and to top it off — it’s got neuroscientific grounding!
 
It appears to me there are two big criticisms of the economics discipline’s assumptions.  One of course is rationality.  The second has to do with the perfect structure of the market and environment that shapes both preferences and the ability to exercise them.  One critique is about social structure: consumers are not atomistic individual units, but rather exchange information and ideas along networks of patterned social relations.

<p>Introduction: Andrew Gelman claims  religion is the “opiate of the elite,”  from this graph:
 
 
 
He says:
  
Religious attendance predicts Republican voting much more among the rich than the poor.
  
This is a really interesting phenomenon — condition on wealth and see different effects of religion.
 
But from looking at that graph, I saw the flipped interpretation — condition on religion, then see different effects of wealth (each line has a different slope).Â  Only the religious become more Republican with greater wealth; secular voters don’t change their preferences when they get rich.</p><p>6 0.41277963 <a title="151-lsi-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-03-27-Seth_Roberts_and_academic_blogging.html">55 brendan oconnor ai-2007-03-27-Seth Roberts and academic blogging</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Cool visualization of agreement levels among Supreme Court justices .  I like how they’re ordered so that the smallest amount of agreement ends up in the lower-left.  Hopefully it’s not deceptive for certain cases: I imagine that summarizing their tendencies to vote certain ways into a one dimensional spectrum would lose important information of other dimensions of agreement or coalitions.</p><p>2 0.97562283 <a title="151-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2006/brendan_oconnor_ai-2006-09-01-Double_thesis_action.html">45 brendan oconnor ai-2006-09-01-Double thesis action</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Today I received my copy of  Beautiful Data , a just-released anthology of articles about, well, working with data.   Lukas  and I contributed a chapter on analyzing social perceptions in web data.   See it here.  After a long process of drafting, proofreading, re-drafting, and bothering the publishers under rather sudden deadlines, I’ve resolved to never use graphics again in anything I write :)
 
Here’s our final figure, a  k-means  clustering of face photos via perceived social attributes (social  concepts/types ? with  exemplars ?): 
   
 
I just started reading the rest of the book and it’s very fun.   Peter Norvig ‘s chapter on language models is gripping.  (It does word segmentation, ciphers, and more, in that lovely python-centric tutorial style extending his previous  spell correction article .)  There are also chapters by many other great researchers and practitioners (some of whom you may have seen around this blog or its neighborhood) like  Andrew Gelman ,  Hadley Wickham ,</p><p>4 0.26145655 <a title="151-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-08-16-A_better_Obama_vs_McCain_poll_aggregation.html">111 brendan oconnor ai-2008-08-16-A better Obama vs McCain poll aggregation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:  Charles Franklin (of Pollster.com) kindly emailed me with many interesting points on this post.  One important note is that my technique isn’t really “no smoothing” — rather, there is now implicit smoothing within the polling houses, by assuming that responses are evenly distributed across the time interval of the poll.
   I was looking at Pollster.com’s page that aggregates many opinion polls on the Presidential race.    Here, they have a chart   that shows the many polls plus lowess fits: 
   
 
So there’s a trend of Obama recently declining.  But it wasn’t clear to me that the fitted curve was correct.  I downloaded the data and started playing around with it.
 
Here are several more graphs I made, with different smoothing parameters for the lowess fit.  Your interpretation completely changes depending which smoothing parameter you like best!
 
   
 
Well, maybe this is an argument to use rolling averages over a fixed number of days or something.  But it would be nice to di</p><p>5 0.24662507 <a title="151-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2013/brendan_oconnor_ai-2013-08-20-Some_analysis_of_tweet_shares_and_%E2%80%9Cpredicting%E2%80%9D_election_outcomes.html">198 brendan oconnor ai-2013-08-20-Some analysis of tweet shares and “predicting” election outcomes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Everyone recently seems to be talking about  this newish paper by Digrazia, McKelvey, Bollen, and Rojas  ( pdf here ) that examines the correlation of Congressional candidate name mentions on Twitter against whether the candidate won the race.  One of the coauthors also wrote a Washington Post  Op-Ed  about it.  I read the paper and I think it’s reasonable, but their op-ed overstates their results.  It claims:
  
“In the 2010 data, our Twitter data predicted the winner in 404 out of 435 competitive races”
  
But this analysis is nowhere in their paper.  Fabio Rojas has now  posted errata/rebuttals  about the op-ed and described this analysis they did here.  There are several major issues off the bat:
  
 They didn’t ever predict 404/435 races; they only analyzed 406 races they call “competitive,” getting 92.5% (in-sample) accuracy, then extrapolated to all races to get the 435 number. 
 They’re reporting about  in-sample  predictions, which is really misleading to a non-scientific audi</p><p>6 0.24265778 <a title="151-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2011/brendan_oconnor_ai-2011-10-05-Be_careful_with_dictionary-based_text_analysis.html">176 brendan oconnor ai-2011-10-05-Be careful with dictionary-based text analysis</a></p>

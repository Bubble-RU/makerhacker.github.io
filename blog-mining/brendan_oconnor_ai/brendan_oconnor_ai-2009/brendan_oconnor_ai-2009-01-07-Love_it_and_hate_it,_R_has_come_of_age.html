<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: R is notoriously hard to learn, but there was just an effort  [1]   [2]  to populate the programming question-and-answer website  StackOverflow with content for the R language .
 
Amusingly, one of the most useful intro questions is:  How to search for “R” materials? 
 
 Mike Driscoll  (who organized an in-person conference event to get this bootstrapped) pointed out that in many ways StackOverflow is a nicer forum for help than a mailing list.  (i.e. the impressive but hard-to-approach  R-help .)  It’s more organized, easier to browse, and repetition and wrong answers can get downvoted.  (And  more thoughts from John Cook .)</p><p>6 0.095351651 <a title="132-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-10-08-Blog_move_has_landed.html">115 brendan oconnor ai-2008-10-08-Blog move has landed</a></p>

Simpson’s paradox via R in three easy steps!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: R  has a fun built-in package,  datasets : a whole bunch of easy-to-use, interesting tables of data.  I found the famous UC Berkeley admissions data set, from a 1970′s study of whether sex discrimination existed in graduate admissions.  It’s famous for illustrating a particular statistical paradox.  Thanks to R’s awesome mosaic plots interface, we can see this really easily.
 
UCBAdmissions is a three-dimensional table (like a matrix): Admit Status x Gender x Dept, with counts for each category as the matrix’s values.  R’s default printing shows the basics just fine.  Here’s the data for just the first of six departments:
   >  UCBAdmissions 
, , Dept = A

          Gender
Admit      Male Female
  Admitted  512     89
  Rejected  313     19

...
 
  
Overall,  women have a lower admittance rate than men :
   >  apply(UCBAdmissions,c(1,2),sum) 

          Gender
Admit         M    F
  Admitted 1198  557
  Rejected 1493 1278

<p>Introduction: I’ve been reading several somewhat recent finance papers ( Antweiler and Frank 2005 ,  Das and Chen 2007 ) that use  Rainbow , the text classification software originally written by  Andrew McCallum  back in 1996.  The last version is from 2002 and the homepage announces he isn’t really supporting it any more.
 
However, as far as I can tell, it might still be the easiest-to-use text classifier package out there.  You don’t have to program — just invoke commandline arguments — and it can accommodate reasonably sized datasets, does tokenization, stopword filtering, etc. for you, and has some useful feature selection and other options.  Based on my limited usage, it seems well-implemented.  If anyone knows of a better one I’d love to hear it.  I once looked at, among other things,  GATE  and  UIMA , and they seemed too hard to use if you wanted to download something that did simple text classification; or else, maybe they didn’t have documentation on how to use them in that manner.

<p>Introduction: There’s a company,  Emotiv , that’s building an  EEG  interface for the game systems.  Any company with a  science-fiction-y vision statement  sounds like a good time to me:
  
Communication between man and machine has always been limited to conscious interaction, with non-conscious communication — expression, intuition, perception — reserved solely for the human realm. At Emotiv, we believe that future communication between man and machine will not only be limited to the conscious communication that exists today, but non-conscious communication will play a significant part.


Our mission is to create the ultimate interface for the next-generation of man-machine interaction, by evolving the interaction between human beings and electronic devices beyond the limits of conscious interface. Emotiv is creating technologies that allow machines to take both conscious and non-conscious inputs directly from your mind.

  Political bias SVD evaluation

<p>Introduction: Earlier this week I asked the question,
 
 How are “art” and “pharmaceuticals” similar? 
 
People sent me lots of submissions!  Some are great, some are a bit of a stretch.
  
 Overpriced by an order of magnitude.
  The letters of “art” are found embedded, in order, in “pharmaceuticals”.
  Search keywords that cost the most to advertise on?
  “Wyeth”: I think this means  this , and  this .
  “Romeo and Juliet” famously includes both “art” (wherefore art thou) and pharmaceuticals (poison!)
  Some art has been created out of pharmaceuticals.
  Some art has been created under the influence of pharmaceuticals.
   
I was asking because I was playing around with a dataset of 100,000 noun phrases’ appearances on the web, from the  Reading the Web  project at CMU.  That is, for a noun like “art”, this data has a large list of phrases in which the word “art” is used, across some 200 million web pages.  For two noun concepts, we can see what they have in common and what’s different by looking at</p><p>4 0.45577323 <a title="132-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2004/brendan_oconnor_ai-2004-11-24-addiction_%26_2_problems_of_economics.html">2 brendan oconnor ai-2004-11-24-addiction & 2 problems of economics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is my idea based off of  Bernheim and Rangel’s  model of addict decision-making .  It’s a really neat model; it manages to relax rationality to allow someone to do something they don’t want to do because they’re addicted to it.  [Rationality assumes a nice well-ordered set of preferences; this model hypothesizes as distinction between emotional "liking" and cognitive, forward "wanting" that can conflict.]  The model is mathematically tractable, it can be used for public welfare analysis, and to top it off — it’s got neuroscientific grounding!
 
It appears to me there are two big criticisms of the economics discipline’s assumptions.  One of course is rationality.  The second has to do with the perfect structure of the market and environment that shapes both preferences and the ability to exercise them.  One critique is about social structure: consumers are not atomistic individual units, but rather exchange information and ideas along networks of patterned social relations.

<p>Introduction: There was an  interesting ICML paper  this year about very large-scale training of deep belief networks (a.k.a. neural networks) for unsupervised concept extraction from images.  They ( Quoc V. Le  and colleagues at Google/Stanford) have a cute example of learning very high-level features that are evoked by images of cats (from YouTube still-image training data); one is shown below.
 
For those of us who work on machine learning and text, the question always comes up, why not DBN’s for language?  Many shallow latent-space text models have been quite successful (LSI, LDA, HMM, LPCFG…); there is hope that some sort of “deeper” concepts could be learned.  I think this is one of the most interesting areas for unsupervised language modeling right now.
 
But note it’s a bad idea to directly analogize results from image analysis to language analysis.  The problems have radically different levels of conceptual abstraction baked-in.  Consider the problem of detecting the concept of a cat; i.e.</p><p>6 0.42621514 <a title="132-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-12-03-Statistics_vs._Machine_Learning%2C_fight%21.html">129 brendan oconnor ai-2008-12-03-Statistics vs. Machine Learning, fight!</a></p>

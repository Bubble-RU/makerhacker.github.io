If you look at the biggest city, then the next biggest city, etc., there tends to be an exponential fall-off in size.
 
I was wondering what this looks like so here’s the classic zipfian plot (log-size vs. log-rank) for city population data from from  populationdata.net :
 
   
 
If you fit a power law — that is, a line on the above logsize-logrank plot — you can use rank to predict the sizes of smaller cities very accurately, according to Will’s analysis.  Larger cities are more problematic, lying off the line.
 
I was curious whether the power law holds  within  countries as well.  The above plot was only for the countries that had more than 10 cities in the dataset — just eight countries.  So here are those same cities again, but plotted against ranks within their respective countries.

<p>Introduction: Watching internet usage vs. income on the Gapminder.org visualizer is very interesting.
 
  
 
Several things are quite apparent.  (1) Internet usage exploded in all countries in the world.  (2) Richer countries have more internet usage (linear relationship on the scatterplot), but it’s been increasing in all countries regardless.
 
The animation has a few issues, of course — I think some of the funny, rapid movements at the very start are due to issues with when they started collecting reliable data on internet usage in the early 90′s, and the data probably started being more reliable at different times in different countries, etc.  
 
These are countervailing phenomena that require attention to variation within and across groups of data.  I can’t imagine pie charts or tables of numbers that could ever convey this level of nuance.

<p>Introduction: These are both useful summaries.  Slate has a  chart of relationships  between Hamas, Hezbollah, Israel, and Lebanon, versus a number of different actors in the region.  NYTimes has  something similar on a map , also showing the sizes of ethnic/religious groups.  Seems the NYTimes is most interesting as far as visualization/graphic design goes.  It also has rich relational information and lots of predicates: does group X have oil wealth?  is group X in the government of country Y?  Etc.  Seems ripe for a  relational concept-learning clustering analysisâ&euro;Ś

<p>Introduction: Here are two great reviews, from 2003 then 2005.
 
1)  PLoS Biology: Economy of the Mind  nicely reviews the field and many interesting experiments.
 
One annoyance: They need to say “Banburismus” is more commonly known as Bayesian learning.  (Banbury, England was a city near Bletchley Park they got their paper from when doing Bayesian statistical codebreaking of the Enigma cipher in World War II.   Read the story here  in MacKay’s excellent free online  textbook .)   Thanks to  neurodudes  for the PLoS link.
 
2)  Neuroeconomics: How neuroscience can inform economics  is written by the leaders of the field, advocating their approach.  I like the detail and their careful descriptions of how cognitive neuroscience findings can enhance our understanding of economic phenomena.
 
Also, the second is useful to read since it’s the target of criticism by the more recent  The case for mindless economics , which I view as an empire-strikes-back sort of paper.

<p>Introduction: Watching internet usage vs. income on the Gapminder.org visualizer is very interesting.
 
  
 
Several things are quite apparent.  (1) Internet usage exploded in all countries in the world.  (2) Richer countries have more internet usage (linear relationship on the scatterplot), but it’s been increasing in all countries regardless.

<p>Introduction: Sometimes it seems bad countries come with long names.  North Korea is “People’s Democratic Republic of Korea”, Libya is “Great Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya”, and the like.  But on the other hand, there’s plenty of counter-examples — it’s the “United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland” and “Republic of Cuba”, after all.  Do long names with good-sounding adjectives correspond with non-democratic governments?
 
Fortunately, this can be tested.  First, what words are out there?  From the  CIA Factbook’s  data on long form names, here are some of the most popular words used by today’s countries, listed with the number of occurrences across all 194 names.  I limited to tokens that appear >= 3 times.  A majority of countries are Republics, while there are some Kingdoms, and even a few Democracies.

<p>Introduction: In light of the Somali transitional government’s recent military triumph over Islamist forces, the BBC did a piece of  very interesting testimonials from everyday Somalis  — they all want a government for peace and order in their lives.  Anarchy is extremely unpopular.   (more info on this.)   A musician complains that since nightclubs are shut down, his only work is at occasional weddings, and adds: 
 The wedding parties are big, spectacular affairs, you wouldn’t think they were in a country without a government. 
 
But it’s only the people who are members of the big armed clans who can have these parties.
 
Other people get married but they cannot have big parties in case they are attacked and robbed. They just get married in secret.
 
I’ve been re-reading Hobbes and this sounds familiar — the enjoyment of all sorts of goods requires a strong organization protecting you, to deter would-be thieves.  That’s what a good government does.
 
The musician concludes:

<p>Introduction: Will Fitzgerald just wrote about  an excellent  article by Steven Strogatz  on Zipf’s Law for the populations of cities.  If you look at the biggest city, then the next biggest city, etc., there tends to be an exponential fall-off in size.
 
I was wondering what this looks like so here’s the classic zipfian plot (log-size vs. log-rank) for city population data from from  populationdata.net :
 
   
 
If you fit a power law — that is, a line on the above logsize-logrank plot — you can use rank to predict the sizes of smaller cities very accurately, according to Will’s analysis.  Larger cities are more problematic, lying off the line.
 
I was curious whether the power law holds  within  countries as well.  The above plot was only for the countries that had more than 10 cities in the dataset — just eight countries.  So here are those same cities again, but plotted against ranks within their respective countries.
 
   
 
The answer is — usually, yes, the power law looks like it holds within</p><p>2 0.97470355 <a title="141-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-04-08-More_fun_with_Gapminder_-_Trendalyzer.html">58 brendan oconnor ai-2007-04-08-More fun with Gapminder - Trendalyzer</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Watching internet usage vs. income on the Gapminder.org visualizer is very interesting.
 
  
 
Several things are quite apparent.  (1) Internet usage exploded in all countries in the world.  (2) Richer countries have more internet usage (linear relationship on the scatterplot), but it’s been increasing in all countries regardless.
 
The animation has a few issues, of course — I think some of the funny, rapid movements at the very start are due to issues with when they started collecting reliable data on internet usage in the early 90′s, and the data probably started being more reliable at different times in different countries, etc.  
 
These are countervailing phenomena that require attention to variation within and across groups of data.  I can’t imagine pie charts or tables of numbers that could ever convey this level of nuance.
 
One last thing.  Going to the linear scale (so you can see differences in large amounts of internet use), watch South Korea vs. United States.

<p>Introduction: Freud Is Widely Taught at Universities, Except in the Psychology Department :
  
PSYCHOANALYSIS and its ideas about the unconscious mind have spread to every nook and cranny of the culture from Salinger to “South Park,” from Fellini to foreign policy. Yet if you want to learn about psychoanalysis at the nation’s top universities, one of the last places to look may be the psychology department.


A new report by the American Psychoanalytic Association has found that while psychoanalysis — or what purports to be psychoanalysis — is alive and well in literature, film, history and just about every other subject in the humanities, psychology departments and textbooks treat it as “desiccated and dead,” a historical artifact instead of “an ongoing movement and a living, evolving process.”
  
I’ve been wondering about this for a while, ever since I heard someone describe Freud as “one of the greatest humanists who ever lived.”  I’m pretty sure he didn’t think of himself that way.  If you’re a</p><p>5 0.16978458 <a title="141-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2011/brendan_oconnor_ai-2011-10-05-Be_careful_with_dictionary-based_text_analysis.html">176 brendan oconnor ai-2011-10-05-Be careful with dictionary-based text analysis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: OK, everyone loves to run dictionary methods for sentiment and other text analysis — counting words from a predefined lexicon in a big corpus, in order to explore or test hypotheses about the corpus.  In particular, this is often done for sentiment analysis: count positive and negative words (according to a sentiment polarity lexicon, which was derived from human raters or previous researchers’ intuitions), and then proclaim the output yields sentiment levels of the documents.  More and more papers come out every day that do this.   I’ve done this myself.   It’s interesting and fun, but it’s easy to get a bunch of meaningless numbers if you don’t carefully validate what’s going on.  There are certainly good studies in this area that do further validation and analysis, but it’s hard to trust a study that just presents a graph with a few overly strong speculative claims as to its meaning.  This happens more than it ought to.

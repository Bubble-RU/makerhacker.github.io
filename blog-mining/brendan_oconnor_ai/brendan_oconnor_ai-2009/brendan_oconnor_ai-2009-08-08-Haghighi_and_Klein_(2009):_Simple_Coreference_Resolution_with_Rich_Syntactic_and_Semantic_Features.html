</p><p>3 It has two-ish modular components:     Syntactic constraints: entity type agreement, appositives, and a few other things that get at syntactic salience. [sent-11, score-0.543]
</p><p>4 For each mention, these constraints filter previous mentions to several possible antecedents. [sent-13, score-0.317]
</p><p>5 They found that syntactic cues have recall issues for non-pronoun references, e. [sent-17, score-0.431]
</p><p>6 They create a very specific lexical resource — of word pairs compatible to be coreferent — by finding coreferent expressions via bootstrapping in a large unlabelled text corpus (Wikipedia abstracts and newswire articles. [sent-21, score-1.05]
</p><p>7 , the text “Al Gore served as the vice-president” then yields the path-pattern “X served as Y”. [sent-29, score-0.281]
</p><p>8 Then there’s one more iteration to extract more word pairs — pairs that appear a large number of times. [sent-30, score-0.562]
</p><p>9 But note, they don’t describe their technique as trying to be a general hypernym finder; rather, its only goal is to find pairs of words (noun phrase heads) that might corefer in text that the final system encounters. [sent-32, score-0.684]
</p><p>10 In fact, they describe the bootstrapping system as merely trying to find instances of noun phrase pairs that exhibit coreference. [sent-33, score-0.888]
</p><p>11 I wonder if it’s fair to think of the bootstrapping system as a miniature coreference detector itself, but tuned for high-precision, by only considering very short syntactic paths (no longer than 1 sentence). [sent-34, score-1.106]
</p><p>12 I also wonder if there are instances of non-pronoun coreference that  aren’t  hyponym-hypernym pairs; if not, my analysis here is silly. [sent-35, score-0.365]
</p><p>13 Coverage seems to be good, or at least useful: many non-pronoun coreference recall errors are solved by using this data. [sent-36, score-0.486]
</p><p>14 (I can’t tell whether it’s two-thirds of all recall errors after the syntactic system, or two-thirds of the errors in Table 1. [sent-37, score-0.701]
</p><p>15 )  And they claim word pairs are usually correct, with a few interesting types of errors (that look quite solvable). [sent-38, score-0.45]
</p><p>16 Instead of presenting a slew of modelling, it cuts to the chase, using very simple algorithms and clear argumentation to illustrate why a particular set of approaches is effective. [sent-42, score-0.233]
</p><p>17 In particular, they think discourse, pragmatics, and salience aren’t the most important issues; instead, better syntactic and semantic modelling would give the biggest gains. [sent-44, score-0.62]
</p><p>18 A simple hand-coded system lends itself to easily describing and motivating every feature by itself — better narrative explanations and insight. [sent-50, score-0.365]
</p><p>19 Final note: it’s not totally fair to consider this system a non-statistical one, because its syntactic and semantic subsystems rest on complicated statistical components that required boatloads of labelled training data — the  Stanford parser ,  Stanford NER , and the  Charniak parser . [sent-52, score-1.061]
</p><p>20 )  Further, as they point out, more complicated structured approaches to the problem of forming entity partitions from features should improve performance. [sent-55, score-0.401]

<p>Introduction: Here is an intuitive justification for the  B3  evaluation metric often used in coreference resolution, based on whether mention pairs are coreferent. If a mention from the document is chosen at random,
  
 B3-Recall is the (expected) proportion of its actual coreferents that the system thinks are coreferent with it. 
 B3-Precision is the (expected) proportion of its system-hypothesized coreferents that are actually coreferent with it. 
  
Does this look correct to people? Details below:  
 
In B3′s basic form, it’s a clustering evaluation metric, to evaluate a gold-standard clustering of mentions against a system-produced clustering of mentions.
 
Let \(G\) mean a gold-standard entity and \(S\) mean a system-predicted entity, where an entity is a set of mentions. \(i\)Â refers to a mention; there are \(n\) mentions in the document. \(G_i\) means the gold entity that contains mention \(i\); and \(S_i\) means the system entity that has \(i\).

<p>Introduction: I’m a bit late blogging this, but here’s a messy, exciting — and statistically validated! — new online data source.
 
My friend  Roddy  at Facebook  wrote a post describing their sentiment analysis system , which can evaluate positive or negative sentiment toward a particular topic by looking at a large number of wall messages.  (I’d link to it, but I can’t find the URL anymore — here’s the  Lexicon , but that version only gets term frequencies but no sentiment.)
 
How they constructed their sentiment detector is interesting.  Starting with a list of positive and negative terms, they had a lexical acquisition step to gather many more candidate synonyms and misspellings — a necessity in this social media domain, where  WordNet  ain’t gonna come close!  After manually filtering these candidates, they assess the sentiment toward a mention of a topic by looking for instances of these positive and negative words nearby, along with “negation heuristics” and a few other features.

<p>Introduction: There’s a lot to say about  Powerset , the short-lived natural language search company (2005-2008) where I worked after college.  AI overhype, flying too close to the sun, the psychology of tech journalism and venture capitalism, etc.  A year or two ago I wrote the following bit about Powerset’s technology in response to a question  on Quora .  I’m posting a revised version here.
 
 Question:  What was Powerset’s core innovation in search?  As far as I can tell, they licensed an NLP engine. They did not have a question answering system or any system for information extraction. How was Powerset’s search engine different than Google’s?
 
 My answer:  Powerset built a system vaguely like a question-answering system on top of Xerox PARC’s NLP engine.  The output is better described as query-focused summarization rather than question answering; primarily, it matched semantic fragments of the user query against indexed semantic relations, with lots of keyword/ngram-matching fallback for when</p><p>6 0.13501731 <a title="150-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2012/brendan_oconnor_ai-2012-03-09-I_don%E2%80%99t_get_this_web_parsing_shared_task.html">181 brendan oconnor ai-2012-03-09-I don’t get this web parsing shared task</a></p>

 update  this reaction might be totally wrong; in particular, the conll dependencies for at least some languages were done completely by hand.
   
Malt and MSTParser were designed for the Yamada and Matsumodo dependencies formalism (the one used for the CoNLL dependency parsing shared task, from the   penn2malt   tool).  Their feature sets and probably many other design decisions were created to support that.  If you compare their outputs side-by-side, you will see that the Stanford Dependencies are a substantially different formalism; for example, compound verbs are handled very differently (the paper talks about copula example). 
I think the following conclusion is premature:
  
Notwithstanding the very large amount of research that has gone into dependency

<p>Introduction: There was an  interesting ICML paper  this year about very large-scale training of deep belief networks (a.k.a. neural networks) for unsupervised concept extraction from images.  They ( Quoc V. Le  and colleagues at Google/Stanford) have a cute example of learning very high-level features that are evoked by images of cats (from YouTube still-image training data); one is shown below.
 
For those of us who work on machine learning and text, the question always comes up, why not DBN’s for language?  Many shallow latent-space text models have been quite successful (LSI, LDA, HMM, LPCFG…); there is hope that some sort of “deeper” concepts could be learned.  I think this is one of the most interesting areas for unsupervised language modeling right now.
 
But note it’s a bad idea to directly analogize results from image analysis to language analysis.  The problems have radically different levels of conceptual abstraction baked-in.  Consider the problem of detecting the concept of a cat; i.e.</p><p>6 0.55692536 <a title="150-lsi-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2012/brendan_oconnor_ai-2012-10-02-Powerset%E2%80%99s_natural_language_search_system.html">188 brendan oconnor ai-2012-10-02-Powerset’s natural language search system</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I laugh out loud every time I reread  Cosma Shalizi’s review of “New Kind of Science”  (2005).  I remember reading it back in college when everyone was talking about the book, when I was just losing my naivete about the popular science treatments of complex systems and such.  I must be getting more cynical as I get older because I keep liking the review more.  This time my favorite line was
  
Wolfram even goes on to refute post-modernism on this basis; I won’t touch that except to say that I’d have paid a lot to see Wolfram and Jacques Derrida go one-on-one.
  
And on the issue of running your own conventions and citing yourself, he compares it to

<p>Introduction: I haven’t done a paper review on this blog for a while, so here we go.
 
 Coreference  resolution is an interesting NLP problem.  ( Examples. )  It involves honest-to-goodness syntactic, semantic, and discourse phenomena, but still seems like a real cognitive task that humans have to solve when reading text [1].  I haven’t read the whole literature, but I’ve always been puzzled by the crop of papers on it I’ve seen in the last year or two.  There’s a big focus on fancy graph/probabilistic/constrained optimization algorithms, but often these papers gloss over the linguistic features — the core information they actually make their decisions with [2].  I never understood why the latter isn’t the most important issue.  Therefore, it was a joy to read

<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: Everyone recently seems to be talking about  this newish paper by Digrazia, McKelvey, Bollen, and Rojas  ( pdf here ) that examines the correlation of Congressional candidate name mentions on Twitter against whether the candidate won the race.  One of the coauthors also wrote a Washington Post  Op-Ed  about it.  I read the paper and I think it’s reasonable, but their op-ed overstates their results.  It claims:
  
“In the 2010 data, our Twitter data predicted the winner in 404 out of 435 competitive races”
  
But this analysis is nowhere in their paper.  Fabio Rojas has now  posted errata/rebuttals  about the op-ed and described this analysis they did here.  There are several major issues off the bat:
  
 They didn’t ever predict 404/435 races; they only analyzed 406 races they call “competitive,” getting 92.5% (in-sample) accuracy, then extrapolated to all races to get the 435 number. 
 They’re reporting about  in-sample  predictions, which is really misleading to a non-scientific audi</p><p>5 0.51654869 <a title="150-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-12-27-Facebook_sentiment_mining_predicts_presidential_polls.html">131 brendan oconnor ai-2008-12-27-Facebook sentiment mining predicts presidential polls</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m a bit late blogging this, but here’s a messy, exciting — and statistically validated! — new online data source.
 
My friend  Roddy  at Facebook  wrote a post describing their sentiment analysis system , which can evaluate positive or negative sentiment toward a particular topic by looking at a large number of wall messages.  (I’d link to it, but I can’t find the URL anymore — here’s the  Lexicon , but that version only gets term frequencies but no sentiment.)
 
How they constructed their sentiment detector is interesting.  Starting with a list of positive and negative terms, they had a lexical acquisition step to gather many more candidate synonyms and misspellings — a necessity in this social media domain, where  WordNet  ain’t gonna come close!  After manually filtering these candidates, they assess the sentiment toward a mention of a topic by looking for instances of these positive and negative words nearby, along with “negation heuristics” and a few other features.

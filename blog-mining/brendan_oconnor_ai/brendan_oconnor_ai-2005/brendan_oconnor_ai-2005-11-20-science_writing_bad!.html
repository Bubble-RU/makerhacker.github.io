<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: Lukas  and I were trying to write a succinct comparison of the most popular packages that are typically used for data analysis.  I think most people choose one based on what people around them use or what they learn in school, so I’ve found it hard to find comparative information.  I’m posting the table here in hopes of useful comments.

<p>Introduction: William Saletan, a writer for Slate, recently wrote  a loud series of articles  on genetic racial differences in IQ in the wake of James Watson’s  controversial remarks .  It prompted lots of discussion; here is an  excellent response from Richard Nisbett , a leading authority in the field on the environmentalist side of the debate.
 
More academic articles:  Rushton and Jensen’s 2005 review  of evidence for genetic differences; and what I’ve found to be the most balanced so far, the 1995 APA report  Inteligence: Knowns and Unknowns  which concludes for all the heated claims out there, the scientific evidence tends to be pretty weak.
 
Blog world:  Funny title from Brad DeLong ; and another  Slate response to Saletan and Rushton/Jensen .
 
The politics of the race and intelligence question is a huge distraction from trying to find out the actual truth of the matter.  But I suppose the political implications are why it attracts so much attention — for good or bad.

<p>Introduction: Update Aug 10: THIS IS NOT A SUMMARY OF THE WHOLE PAPER!  it’s whining about one particular method of analysis before talking about other things further down
   
A quick note on  Berg-Kirkpatrick et al EMNLP-2012, “An Empirical Investigation of Statistical Signiﬁcance in NLP” .  They make lots of graphs of p-values against observed magnitudes and talk about “curves”, e.g.
 
 We see the same curve-shaped trend we saw for summarization and dependency parsing. Different group comparisons, same group comparisons, and system combination comparisons form distinct curves. 
 
For example, Figure 2.
 
   
 
I fear they made 10 graphs to rediscover a basic statistical fact: a p-value comes from a null hypothesis CDF.  That’s what these “curve-shaped trends” are in all their graphs.  They are CDFs.
 
To back up, the statistical significance testing question is whether, in their notation, the observed dataset performance difference \(\delta(x)\) is “real” or not: if you were to resample the data,</p><p>5 0.46366203 <a title="28-lsi-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-07-04-City_crisis_simulation_%28e.g._terrorist_attack%29.html">14 brendan oconnor ai-2005-07-04-City crisis simulation (e.g. terrorist attack)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: WP:  Computers simulate terrorist extremes 
 
Los Alamos scientists are running terrorist attack/response simulations. Well, the article title is misleading, they’re not simulating terrorists (which would pose a whole set of interesting questions about scientific knowledge, social construction and security), but rather, the impact on telecomm, health, and infrastructure systems.  They’re using the standard justifications for systems simulation: these are big, highly complex, highly interdependent systems that are ill-understood and have had drastic domino-effect collapses before (like the northeast power blackout).

<p>Introduction: I’m tired of reading papers that use an  SVM  but don’t say which kernel they used.  (There’s tons of such papers in NLP and, I think, other areas that do applied machine learning.)  I suspect a lot of these papers are actually using a linear kernel.
 
An un-kernelized, linear SVM is nearly the same as  logistic regression  — every feature independently increases or decreases the classifier’s output prediction.  But a quadratic kernelized SVM is much more like boosted depth-2 decision trees.  It can do automatic combinations of pairs of features — a potentially very different thing, since you can start throwing in features that don’t do anything on their own but might have useful interactions with others.  (And of course, more complicated kernels do progressively more complicated and non-linear things.)
 
I have heard people say they download an SVM package, try a bunch of different kernels, and find the linear kernel is the best. In such cases they could have just used a logistic regr</p><p>2 0.96707749 <a title="28-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2010/brendan_oconnor_ai-2010-04-14-quick_note%3A_cer_et_al_2010.html">159 brendan oconnor ai-2010-04-14-quick note: cer et al 2010</a></p>

 update  this reaction might be totally wrong; in particular, the conll dependencies for at least some languages were done completely by hand.
   
Malt and MSTParser were designed for the Yamada and Matsumodo dependencies formalism (the one used for the CoNLL dependency parsing shared task, from the   penn2malt   tool).  Their feature sets and probably many other design decisions were created to support that.  If you compare their outputs side-by-side, you will see that the Stanford Dependencies are a substantially different formalism; for example, compound verbs are handled very differently (the paper talks about copula example). 
I think the following conclusion is premature:

<p>Introduction: An two-step explanation for distrust of science: (1) journalists write up poor science or take out the evidence and information from a scientific study, then (2) people read that and criticize science for being unfounded, arbitrary, etc.   Link .  Some fun quotes:   
 Statistics are what causes the most fear for reporters, and so they are usually just edited out, with interesting consequences. Because science isn’t about something being true or not true: that’s a humanities graduate parody. It’s about the error bar, statistical significance, it’s about how reliable and valid the experiment was, it’s about coming to a verdict, about a hypothesis, on the back of lots of bits of evidence.  
 
 and   
 
  So how do the media work around their inability to deliver scientific evidence? They use authority figures, the very antithesis of what science is about, as if they were priests, or politicians, or parent figures. “Scientists today said … scientists revealed … scientists warned.” And if t</p><p>4 0.41556466 <a title="28-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-08-08-Haghighi_and_Klein_%282009%29%3A_Simple_Coreference_Resolution_with_Rich_Syntactic_and_Semantic_Features.html">150 brendan oconnor ai-2009-08-08-Haghighi and Klein (2009): Simple Coreference Resolution with Rich Syntactic and Semantic Features</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I haven’t done a paper review on this blog for a while, so here we go.
 
 Coreference  resolution is an interesting NLP problem.  ( Examples. )  It involves honest-to-goodness syntactic, semantic, and discourse phenomena, but still seems like a real cognitive task that humans have to solve when reading text [1].  I haven’t read the whole literature, but I’ve always been puzzled by the crop of papers on it I’ve seen in the last year or two.  There’s a big focus on fancy graph/probabilistic/constrained optimization algorithms, but often these papers gloss over the linguistic features — the core information they actually make their decisions with [2].  I never understood why the latter isn’t the most important issue.  Therefore, it was a joy to read

<p>Introduction: update 2012-10-25 : I’ve been informed there is a new maintainer for Mawk, who has probably fixed the bugs I’ve been seeing.
  

From: Gert Hulselmans   


[The bugs you have found are] indeed true with mawk v1.3.3 which comes standard with Debian/Ubuntu.  This version is almost not developed the last 10 years.


I now already use mawk v1.3.4 maintained by another developer (Thomas E. Dickey) 
for more than a year on huge datafiles (sometimes several GB).


The problems/wrong results I had with mawk v1.3.3 sometimes are gone. In his version, normally all open/known bugs are fixed.


This version can be downloaded from:  http://invisible-island.net/mawk/ 

     update 2010-04-30  : I have since found large datasets where mawk is buggy and gives the wrong result.  nawk seems safe.   When one of these newfangled   “Big Data”   sets comes your way, the very first thing you have to do is data munging: shuffling around file formats, renaming fields and the like.

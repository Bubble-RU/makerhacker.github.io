<p>Introduction: Since blogging is hard, but reading is easy, lately I’ve taken to bookmarking interesting articles I’m reading, with the plan of blogging about them later.  This follow-through has happened a few times, but not that often.  In an amazing moment of thesis procrastination, today I sat down and figured out how to turn my  del.icio.us bookmarks  into a nice blogpost, with the plan that every week a post will appear with links I’ve recently read, or maybe I’ll use the script to generate a draft for myself that I’ll revise, or something.
 
But for this first such link post, I put in a whole bunch of them beyond just the last week — why have just a few when you could have *all* of them?  Future link posts will be shorter, I promise.

Pick an organism.  Two propositions, H and E, each may be either true or false about it.

(2) Since it looks like it was intelligently designed, it was.  He really emphasized the E component of the argument.
 
Justifications for E: Lots of organisms look like they were intelligently designed.  They have complex and intricate mechanisms involving coordination among many components.  Sometimes they look like things humans would design: for example, bacteria locomotion devices sometimes bear uncanny resemblance to human-designed motors or propellers.

<p>Introduction: Either God is tricky, or maybe probability is.
 
Pascal’s Wager: Say there’s only a small chance God exists.  If you are an atheist but God does actually exist, He will send you to hell for eternity.  This is infinitely bad.  Therefore you should believe in God on the off-chance he does exist, since a small chance of something infinitely bad is worse than the alternative.
 
 Believe in Pascal’s Wager?  Have I got a deal for you!  says if you believe it, you should send Alex Tabarrok money because he will put in a good word to God for you.  Hey, there’s a small chance he has a direct line to God, which yields infinite utility (or avoids hell’s infinite disutility).
 
FWIW, I’m thinking the paradoxes in this sort of arithmetic always happen when you start doing addition/multiplication distribution across those darn infinities.  Like on the third page Tabarrok starts talking about p1*Inf – p2*Inf = (p1-p2)*Inf.  That’s shady shit.

<p>Introduction: Some ex-hedge fund analysts recently started a non-profit devoted to evaluating the effectiveness of hundreds of charities, and  apparently have been making waves (NYT) .  A few interesting reports have been posted on their website,  givewell.net  — they make recommendations for which charities where donors’ money is used most efficiently for saving lives or helping the disadvantaged.
 
(Does anyone else have interesting data on charity effectiveness?  I’ve heard that evaluations are the big thing in philanthropy world now, and certainly the Gates Foundation talks a lot about it.)
 
Obviously this sort of evaluation is tricky, but it  has  to be the right approach.  The NYT article makes them sound like they’re a bit arrogant, which is too bad; on the other hand, any one who makes claims to have better empirical information than the established wisdom will always end up in that dynamic.

<p>Introduction: Since I posted the link to his blog, Baron just  wrote about   Cardinal Schönborn’s anti-evolution Op-Ed piece .  I agree absolutely that people should learn about the psychology of judgment and probability for these sorts of questions, where it’s really hard to understand that random processes can generate things that seem not so random.
 
I’m still thinking about how the psychology of judgment plays in to  the analysis below .  I have a feeling that people’s intuitions are usually too hospitable for explanations based on intention.  E.g.: People are poor, therefore someone is trying to make them poor.  Organizations (corportations, governments) do things, therefore someone (say, at the top) ordered them to do these things.  Natural disasters happen, therefore someone is wishing them upon us.  Etc., etc.  I’m still not sure how a bayesian dissection of whether “looks intentful” implies “is intentful” shows us whether such an “intent-seeking” bias (hey, I have to call it something) is</p><p>3 0.99784321 <a title="19-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-09-15-Dollar_auction.html">77 brendan oconnor ai-2007-09-15-Dollar auction</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I got nervous and panicky just reading about this game.  I wonder if I could con some people into playing it.
  
Economics professors have a standard game they use to demonstrate how apparently rational decisions can create a disastrous result. They call it a “dollar auction.” The rules are simple. The professor offers a dollar for sale to the highest bidder, with only one wrinkle: the second-highest bidder has to pay up on their losing bid as well. Several students almost always get sucked in. The first bids a penny, looking to make 99 cents. The second bids 2 cents, the third 3 cents, and so on, each feeling they have a chance at something good on the cheap. The early stages are fun, and the bidders wonder what possessed the professor to be willing to lose some money.


The problem surfaces when the bidders get up close to a dollar. After 99 cents the last vestige of profitability disappears, but the bidding continues between the two highest players. They now realize that they stand</p><p>4 0.99653912 <a title="19-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-06-05-Clinton-Obama_support_visualization.html">105 brendan oconnor ai-2008-06-05-Clinton-Obama support visualization</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Rational choice has been a huge imperialistic success, growing in popularity and being applied to more and more fields.  Why is this?  It’s not because the rational choice model of decision-making is particularly realistic.  Rather, it’s because rational choice is a  completely specified theory of human behavior , and therefore is great at generating hypotheses.  Given any situation involving people, rational choice can be used to generate a hypothesis about what to expect.  That is, you just ask, “What would a person do to maximize their own benefit?”
 
Similar things have been said about evolutionary psychology: you can always predict behavior by asking “what would hunter-gatherers do?”  Now, certainly both rational choice and evolutionary psychology don’t always generate  correct  hypotheses, but they’re incredibly useful because they at least give you a starting point.
 
Witness the theory of bounded rationality: just like rational choice, except amended to consider computational l</p><p>6 0.9933573 <a title="19-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-06-10-Freak-Freakonomics_%28Ariel_Rubinstein_is_the_shit%21%29.html">63 brendan oconnor ai-2007-06-10-Freak-Freakonomics (Ariel Rubinstein is the shit!)</a></p>

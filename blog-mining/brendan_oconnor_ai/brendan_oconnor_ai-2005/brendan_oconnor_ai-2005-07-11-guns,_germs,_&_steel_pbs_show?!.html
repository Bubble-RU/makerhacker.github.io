<p>Introduction: Working on applied AI-related problems has really tempered my outlook away from theory.  Apologies for another Rorty-related post, but I loved this little bit I just came across, from  Stanley Fish (on slate.com) : 
 When Rorty concluded one of his dramatically undramatic performances, the hands shot up like quivering spears, and the questions were hurled in outraged tones that were almost comically in contrast to the low-key withdrawn words that had provoked them. 
 
Why outrage? Because more often than not a Rortyan sentence would, with irritatingly little fuss, take away everything his hearers believed in. Take, for example, this little Rortyan gem: “Time will tell; but epistemology won’t.” That is to sayâ€”and the fact that I have recourse to the ponderously academic circumlocution “that is to say” tells its own (for me) sad storyâ€”if you’re putting your faith in some grandly ambitious account of the way we know things and hoping that if you get the account right, you will be that</p><p>4 0.058960788 <a title="20-tfidf-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-01-02-The_Jungle_Economy.html">47 brendan oconnor ai-2007-01-02-The Jungle Economy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I wish I knew Hebrew .  Well, fortunately there is also an English article version of  Equilibrium in the Jungle  (Piccione and Rubinstein ’06): 
 In the typical analysis of an exchange economy, agents are involved in consumption and exchange goods voluntarily when mutually beneficial. The endowments and the preferences are the primitives of the model. The distribution of consumption in society is determined endogenously through trade.  
 
This paper is motivated by a complementary perspective on human interaction. Throughout the history of mankind, it has been quite common (and we suspect that it will remain so in the future) that economic agents, individually or collectively, use power to seize control of assets held by others.  The exercise of power is pervasive in every society and takes several forms. Often, power is purely physical. Sometimes, however, power is more gentle.  In the male-female “market”, for example, charm and attraction play a key role in obtaining a favourite ma</p><p>5 0.056733489 <a title="20-tfidf-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-07-27-China%3A_fines_for_bad_maps.html">71 brendan oconnor ai-2007-07-27-China: fines for bad maps</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is fascinating — In China,  you can get fined if you make a map of China without Taiwan or other disputed territories .  Reminds me of being confused trying to find the primary airline of China.
 
   
 
Based of vague recollections of its name, I searched Google for  {{ china air }} .  The first hit was for  China Airlines .  But the second hit was  Air China .  The first is the state carrier of the ROC (Taiwan), the second is the PRC (mainland China).  Turns out my intended concept, “Official Chinese airline”, isn’t a coherent concept if your political worldview includes both the ROC and PRC as entities.  But maybe what I should have wanted was just airlines that fly around East Asia and various parts of China; in that case, getting both airlines is the right thing to do.  At least Google got them both at the top of the list.

<p>Introduction: Just read an interesting analysis on the the simultaneous rise of the cultural left and right (“hippies and evangelicals”) through the 50′s and 60′s.   Brink Lindsey argues here  that they were both reactions to post-war material prosperity:
  
On the left gathered those who were most alive to the new possibilities created by the unprecedented mass affluence of the postwar years but at the same time were hostile to the social institutions — namely, the market and the middle-class work ethic — that created those possibilities. On the right rallied those who staunchly supported the institutions that created prosperity but who shrank from the social dynamism they were unleashing. One side denounced capitalism but gobbled its fruits; the other cursed the fruits while defending the system that bore them. Both causes were quixotic, and consequently neither fully realized its ambitions.
  
I love  neat sweeping theories of history ; I can’t take it overly seriously but it is so fun.

<p>Introduction: I must have seen a zillion draft versions of this study floating around online, but here’s a terrific preprint:  â€œEconomic manâ€? in cross-cultural perspective: Behavioral experiments in 15 small-scale societies  (Henrich, Boyd, Bowles, Camerer, Fehr, Gintis, McElreath, Alvard, Barr, Ensminger, Henrich, Hill, Gil-White, Gurven, Marlowe, Patton, and Tracer 2005 (!)).  So looks like we’re now pretty sure, culture affects cooperation, you can see it in social practices.  It’s a really neat study.  The writeup in this version is terrific, they talk about implications for culture-gene evolution and have great statistical analysis of cultural factors on ultimatum game performance.</p><p>5 0.41487148 <a title="20-lsi-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-07-04-freakonomics_blog.html">15 brendan oconnor ai-2005-07-04-freakonomics blog</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Looks like it’s become a mini-series: Jared Diamond’s  Guns, Germs, and Steel has hit PBS!   Great book, if repetitive and a little too ambitious — he has a great environmental/technology explanation of the differences in societal development between Europe and the Americas, but he’s pretty weak when trying to tackle Asia vs. Europe, or a number of other situations talked about near the end of the book.  But anyway, it’s fantastic social science.
 
Wish I had a TV around… it would be nice if the show made it onto the web.

<p>Introduction: Everyone recently seems to be talking about  this newish paper by Digrazia, McKelvey, Bollen, and Rojas  ( pdf here ) that examines the correlation of Congressional candidate name mentions on Twitter against whether the candidate won the race.  One of the coauthors also wrote a Washington Post  Op-Ed  about it.  I read the paper and I think it’s reasonable, but their op-ed overstates their results.  It claims:
  
“In the 2010 data, our Twitter data predicted the winner in 404 out of 435 competitive races”
  
But this analysis is nowhere in their paper.  Fabio Rojas has now  posted errata/rebuttals  about the op-ed and described this analysis they did here.  There are several major issues off the bat:
  
 They didn’t ever predict 404/435 races; they only analyzed 406 races they call “competitive,” getting 92.5% (in-sample) accuracy, then extrapolated to all races to get the 435 number. 
 They’re reporting about  in-sample  predictions, which is really misleading to a non-scientific audi</p><p>4 0.27717912 <a title="20-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-12-27-Facebook_sentiment_mining_predicts_presidential_polls.html">131 brendan oconnor ai-2008-12-27-Facebook sentiment mining predicts presidential polls</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m a bit late blogging this, but here’s a messy, exciting — and statistically validated! — new online data source.
 
My friend  Roddy  at Facebook  wrote a post describing their sentiment analysis system , which can evaluate positive or negative sentiment toward a particular topic by looking at a large number of wall messages.  (I’d link to it, but I can’t find the URL anymore — here’s the  Lexicon , but that version only gets term frequencies but no sentiment.)
 
How they constructed their sentiment detector is interesting.  Starting with a list of positive and negative terms, they had a lexical acquisition step to gather many more candidate synonyms and misspellings — a necessity in this social media domain, where  WordNet  ain’t gonna come close!  After manually filtering these candidates, they assess the sentiment toward a mention of a topic by looking for instances of these positive and negative words nearby, along with “negation heuristics” and a few other features.

<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

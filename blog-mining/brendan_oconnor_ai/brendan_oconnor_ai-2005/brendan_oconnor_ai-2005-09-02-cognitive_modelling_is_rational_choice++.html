<p>Introduction: I was planning to write some  WordNet  lookup code tonight.  But instead I’ve learned of too many intersecting things.
 
First, there are a zillion things to do this weekend ( hooray flavorpill ):
 
  Picasso and American Art  exhibit continuing at  SFMOMA .  I saw it very briefly last weekend but want some more.  And Doug claims there’s an interesting photography exhibit there too.
  Reading from  We Don’t Need Another Wave: Dispatches from the Next Generation of Feminists , a fascinating looking book I’ve seen many times in the bookstores around here.  By that I mean at least Modern Times (the neat Mission bookstore) and the Anarchist Collective Bookstore (out on the Haight).  And the reading is at Modern Times,  just down the street  from my house!  Amazing.  Tomorrow at 7:30.
  Since anarchists were just mentioned, fortuitously there also appears: the  Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair  this Saturday and Sunday!  Speakers and books down by Golden Gate Park, oh my.

<p>Introduction: Herbert Gintis thinks  it’s time to unify the behavioral sciences. Sociology, economics, political science, human biology, anthropology and others all study the same thing, but each is based on different incompatible models of individual human behavior. There seems to be evidence that new developments have the potential to offer a more unifying theory. Evolutionary biology should be the basis of understanding much of human behavior. Rational choice and game theoretic frameworks are finding greater acceptance beyond economics; in the meantime, other fields need to absorb sociology’s emphasis on socialization — that people do things or understand the world in a way taught by society. The human behavioral sciences are still rife with many smaller inconsistencies; for example, according to Gintis, only anthropolgists look at the influence of culture across groups, but only sociologists look at culture within groups.

<p>Introduction: I got nervous and panicky just reading about this game.  I wonder if I could con some people into playing it.
  
Economics professors have a standard game they use to demonstrate how apparently rational decisions can create a disastrous result. They call it a “dollar auction.” The rules are simple. The professor offers a dollar for sale to the highest bidder, with only one wrinkle: the second-highest bidder has to pay up on their losing bid as well. Several students almost always get sucked in. The first bids a penny, looking to make 99 cents. The second bids 2 cents, the third 3 cents, and so on, each feeling they have a chance at something good on the cheap. The early stages are fun, and the bidders wonder what possessed the professor to be willing to lose some money.


The problem surfaces when the bidders get up close to a dollar. After 99 cents the last vestige of profitability disappears, but the bidding continues between the two highest players. They now realize that they stand</p><p>6 0.067504942 <a title="26-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-03-15-Computability_and_induction_and_ideal_rationality_and_the_simpsons.html">52 brendan oconnor ai-2007-03-15-Computability and induction and ideal rationality and the simpsons</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Don’t have time to read much right now, but received word about a neat-looking paper:  Uncomputability: The Problem of Induction Internalized  by Kevin Kelly.
 
Kevin Kelly’s website has an awesome statement that mirrors thoughts I’ve been having for the last few years — the incredible importance of computational constraints applied to reasoning and rationality:
  
Kuhn teaches that a single, deep success suffices to keep a competing paradign on the table.  Not surprisingly, computational learning theory shows its superiority over ideal theories of rationality when we trade in our ideal agents for more realistic, computable agents.  The foundation of the deep success is a strong structural analogy between the halting problem and the problem of inductive generalization, allowing for a unified treatment of both, from the ground up.  One consequence of the approach is that one can often show that computable agents are forced to choose between ideal rationality and finding the right answer</p><p>5 0.49883005 <a title="26-lsi-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2004/brendan_oconnor_ai-2004-11-20-gintis%3A_theoretical_unity_in_the_social_sciences.html">1 brendan oconnor ai-2004-11-20-gintis: theoretical unity in the social sciences</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Since I posted the link to his blog, Baron just  wrote about   Cardinal Schönborn’s anti-evolution Op-Ed piece .  I agree absolutely that people should learn about the psychology of judgment and probability for these sorts of questions, where it’s really hard to understand that random processes can generate things that seem not so random.
 
I’m still thinking about how the psychology of judgment plays in to  the analysis below .  I have a feeling that people’s intuitions are usually too hospitable for explanations based on intention.  E.g.: People are poor, therefore someone is trying to make them poor.  Organizations (corportations, governments) do things, therefore someone (say, at the top) ordered them to do these things.  Natural disasters happen, therefore someone is wishing them upon us.  Etc., etc.  I’m still not sure how a bayesian dissection of whether “looks intentful” implies “is intentful” shows us whether such an “intent-seeking” bias (hey, I have to call it something) is</p><p>2 0.9989835 <a title="26-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-09-15-Dollar_auction.html">77 brendan oconnor ai-2007-09-15-Dollar auction</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I got nervous and panicky just reading about this game.  I wonder if I could con some people into playing it.
  
Economics professors have a standard game they use to demonstrate how apparently rational decisions can create a disastrous result. They call it a “dollar auction.” The rules are simple. The professor offers a dollar for sale to the highest bidder, with only one wrinkle: the second-highest bidder has to pay up on their losing bid as well. Several students almost always get sucked in. The first bids a penny, looking to make 99 cents. The second bids 2 cents, the third 3 cents, and so on, each feeling they have a chance at something good on the cheap. The early stages are fun, and the bidders wonder what possessed the professor to be willing to lose some money.


The problem surfaces when the bidders get up close to a dollar. After 99 cents the last vestige of profitability disappears, but the bidding continues between the two highest players. They now realize that they stand</p><p>3 0.99845546 <a title="26-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-06-05-Clinton-Obama_support_visualization.html">105 brendan oconnor ai-2008-06-05-Clinton-Obama support visualization</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Rational choice has been a huge imperialistic success, growing in popularity and being applied to more and more fields.  Why is this?  It’s not because the rational choice model of decision-making is particularly realistic.  Rather, it’s because rational choice is a  completely specified theory of human behavior , and therefore is great at generating hypotheses.  Given any situation involving people, rational choice can be used to generate a hypothesis about what to expect.  That is, you just ask, “What would a person do to maximize their own benefit?”
 
Similar things have been said about evolutionary psychology: you can always predict behavior by asking “what would hunter-gatherers do?”  Now, certainly both rational choice and evolutionary psychology don’t always generate  correct  hypotheses, but they’re incredibly useful because they at least give you a starting point.
 
Witness the theory of bounded rationality: just like rational choice, except amended to consider computational l</p><p>5 0.99712282 <a title="26-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-06-10-Freak-Freakonomics_%28Ariel_Rubinstein_is_the_shit%21%29.html">63 brendan oconnor ai-2007-06-10-Freak-Freakonomics (Ariel Rubinstein is the shit!)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I don’t care how lame anyone thinks this is, but economic theorist  Ariel Rubinstein  is the shit.  He’s funny, self-deprecating, and brilliant.  I was just re-reading  his delightful, sarcastic review of Freakonomics .  (Overly dramatized visual depiction below; hey, conflict sells.)
 
    The review consists of excerpts from his own upcoming super-worldwide-bestseller, “Freak-Freakonomics”.  It is full of golden quotes such as: 
  Chapter 2: Why do economists earn more than mathematicians?  
 
…
 
The comparison between architects and prostitutes can be applied to mathematicians and economists: The former are more skilled, highly educated and intelligent.  
 
To elaborate: 
 Levitt has never encountered a girl who dreams of being a prostitute and I have never met a child who dreams of being an economist. Like prostitutes, the skill required of economists is “not necessarily ‘specialized’” (106). And, finally, here is a new explanation for the salary gap between mathematicians and eco</p><p>6 0.99614185 <a title="26-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-09-08-Another_R_flashmob_today.html">152 brendan oconnor ai-2009-09-08-Another R flashmob today</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Herbert Gintis thinks  it’s time to unify the behavioral sciences. Sociology, economics, political science, human biology, anthropology and others all study the same thing, but each is based on different incompatible models of individual human behavior. There seems to be evidence that new developments have the potential to offer a more unifying theory. Evolutionary biology should be the basis of understanding much of human behavior. Rational choice and game theoretic frameworks are finding greater acceptance beyond economics; in the meantime, other fields need to absorb sociology’s emphasis on socialization — that people do things or understand the world in a way taught by society. The human behavioral sciences are still rife with many smaller inconsistencies; for example, according to Gintis, only anthropolgists look at the influence of culture across groups, but only sociologists look at culture within groups.

First, there are a zillion things to do this weekend ( hooray flavorpill ):
 
  Picasso and American Art  exhibit continuing at  SFMOMA .  I saw it very briefly last weekend but want some more.  And Doug claims there’s an interesting photography exhibit there too.
  Reading from  We Don’t Need Another Wave: Dispatches from the Next Generation of Feminists , a fascinating looking book I’ve seen many times in the bookstores around here.  By that I mean at least Modern Times (the neat Mission bookstore) and the Anarchist Collective Bookstore (out on the Haight).  And the reading is at Modern Times,  just down the street  from my house!  Amazing.  Tomorrow at 7:30.
  Since anarchists were just mentioned, fortuitously there also appears: the  Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair  this Saturday and Sunday!  Speakers and books down by Golden Gate Park, oh my.

<p>Introduction: I don’t care how lame anyone thinks this is, but economic theorist  Ariel Rubinstein  is the shit.  He’s funny, self-deprecating, and brilliant.  I was just re-reading  his delightful, sarcastic review of Freakonomics .  (Overly dramatized visual depiction below; hey, conflict sells.)
 
    The review consists of excerpts from his own upcoming super-worldwide-bestseller, “Freak-Freakonomics”.  It is full of golden quotes such as: 
  Chapter 2: Why do economists earn more than mathematicians?  
 
…
 
The comparison between architects and prostitutes can be applied to mathematicians and economists: The former are more skilled, highly educated and intelligent.  
 
To elaborate: 
 Levitt has never encountered a girl who dreams of being a prostitute and I have never met a child who dreams of being an economist. Like prostitutes, the skill required of economists is “not necessarily ‘specialized’” (106). And, finally, here is a new explanation for the salary gap between mathematicians and eco</p><p>6 0.11067487 <a title="25-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2006/brendan_oconnor_ai-2006-06-03-Rock%2C_Paper%2C_Scissors.html">39 brendan oconnor ai-2006-06-03-Rock, Paper, Scissors</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Pure game theory is debatably social science, so here goes.
 
    Inspired by various 5-, 7-, and even   25-move extensions  to Rock, Paper, Scissors, my friends and I were wondering whether it’s possible to have an even-move version.  It doesn’t seem possible, at least for 4-RPS.  I conjecture that all even-RPS’s might be similarly impossible.

<p>Introduction: I previously  posted  two neuroeconomics reviews.   Here’s a new one from this year  in Trends in Cognitive Sciences.  It’s interesting because not only does it look at using psychological knowledge to inform economics, but it also reviews work in the other direction: using economic decision and organizational theory to study brain systems.  For example,   here’s a paper  that analyzes brain reward circuitry using labor supply theory.

<p>Introduction: Upload your poker hand histories to  www.pokernomics.com , economist Stephen Levitt’s fringe-of-economics project to study what are effective strategies in poker.  This absolultely makes sense to me as an economics research project, only because I’m used to thinking of economics from the view of multi-agent systems and game theory…  This is definitely all about game theory, maybe not economics.  Game theory reaches beyond the bounds of the study of goods and services…

<p>Introduction: The Stanford Engineering school has put up videos and course materials for several programming, AI, and optimization courses online.  They did get some of the ones that are taught by excellent lecturers — e.g. introductory programming (the CS dept has craploads of money, so can afford to hire specialist lecturers, which results in very good courses), and Brad Osgood on the FFT (he’s just such a good lecturer).
 
 Main link ,  minor link. 
 
I was looking through the transcript of  Chris Manning’s introductory lecture  for CS224N, Natural Language Processing, last year.  ( SEE link ;  actual website link .)  I took this same course years ago as a sophomore, and this part sounded familiar:
  
So if you look at the early history of NLP, NLP essentially started in the 1950s. It started just after World War II in the beginning of the Cold War. And what NLP started off as is the field of  machine translation , of can you use computers to translate automatically from one language to another l</p><p>3 0.63380253 <a title="25-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-03-15-Feminists%2C_anarchists%2C_computational_complexity%2C_bounded_rationality%2C_nethack%2C_and_other_things_to_do.html">53 brendan oconnor ai-2007-03-15-Feminists, anarchists, computational complexity, bounded rationality, nethack, and other things to do</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was planning to write some  WordNet  lookup code tonight.  But instead I’ve learned of too many intersecting things.
 
First, there are a zillion things to do this weekend ( hooray flavorpill ):
 
  Picasso and American Art  exhibit continuing at  SFMOMA .  I saw it very briefly last weekend but want some more.  And Doug claims there’s an interesting photography exhibit there too.
  Reading from  We Don’t Need Another Wave: Dispatches from the Next Generation of Feminists , a fascinating looking book I’ve seen many times in the bookstores around here.  By that I mean at least Modern Times (the neat Mission bookstore) and the Anarchist Collective Bookstore (out on the Haight).  And the reading is at Modern Times,  just down the street  from my house!  Amazing.  Tomorrow at 7:30.
  Since anarchists were just mentioned, fortuitously there also appears: the  Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair  this Saturday and Sunday!  Speakers and books down by Golden Gate Park, oh my.

<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: [Like medieval Christian societies,] Islamic societies similarly found ingenious ways to circumvent the usury ban.  The primary one was the  double sale .  In this transaction, the borrower would get, for example, both 100 dinars cash and a small piece of cloth valued at the absurdly high price of 15 dinars.  In a year he would have to pay back 100 dinars for the loan of the cash and 15 for the cloth.  These debts were upheld by Sharia courts.
  
The cognition of rules and ethics sure is complex.  I’d love to read the reasoning from those courts.
 
From from Gregory Clark’s  rather intense review  of  Avner Greif ‘s new-ish book on institutional economics.  (Clark’s the one who wrote that  interesting but weird  evolutionary argument about European economic development.)  If you’re in to the little worlds of institutional, evolutionary, and behavioral economics, Greif’s work is really interesting.  Along with other institutional (or is it neo-institutional?) economists, he works to und</p><p>6 0.20878257 <a title="25-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-09-08-Another_R_flashmob_today.html">152 brendan oconnor ai-2009-09-08-Another R flashmob today</a></p>

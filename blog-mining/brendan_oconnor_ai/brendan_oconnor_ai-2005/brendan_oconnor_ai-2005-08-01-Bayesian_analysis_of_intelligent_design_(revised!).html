Pick an organism.  Two propositions, H and E, each may be either true or false about it. 
 H : the organism was designed by an intelligent creator. 
 E : the organism looks like it was designed by an intelligent creator.
 
Most of what I know about Intelligent Design theory (ID) is from seeing a talk by Michael Behe (may 2005).  He had to major lines of argument:  (1) it is implausible that an evolutionary process could produce life that looks as if it was intelligently designed.  (2) Since it looks like it was intelligently designed, it was.  He really emphasized the E component of the argument.

</p><p>7 Though P(H|E) denotes the plausibility H is true given E is true, to evaluate it we have to look at the probability E could be true independently. [sent-25, score-0.549]
</p><p>8 I guess we could take a poll of how many organisms picked at random look intelligently designed, but that confuses me greatly with what the events are and such. [sent-26, score-0.445]
</p><p>9 This notation makes Bayes’ rule look really clean:               P(E| H) O(H|E)  =  -------- * O(H)            P(E|~H)    It’s easy to see:  The “looks designed => was desgned” reasoning of ID is supported by high P(H), high P(E|H), and low P(E|~H). [sent-38, score-0.578]
</p><p>10 H|E : if the organism looks like it was ID’d, the plausibility it actually was. [sent-39, score-0.639]
</p><p>11 (the core ID argument)    H : prior belief organism was designed   E|H : if the organism was ID’d, the plausibility it looks ID’d. [sent-40, score-1.53]
</p><p>12 P(H) is a pretty nasty prior: forgetting the evidence of whether it looks designed, what’s the chance an organism was intelligently designed? [sent-44, score-0.749]
</p><p>13 If you are already certain God exists, it may be reasonable to entertain the notion that organisms were intelligently designed. [sent-47, score-0.559]
</p><p>14 P(E|H) at first seems odd: certainly, if a creator intelligently designed an organism, doesn’t that mean we’d be able to tell? [sent-49, score-0.582]
</p><p>15 H   high   prior belief in a creator and that creator’s likelihood to design life   low   prior disbelief in a creator and that creator’s likelihood to design life       Conclusions: (1) lots hinges on a hard-to-debate prior P(H). [sent-65, score-2.064]
</p><p>16 This implies that ID can be quite rational given a strong prior belief in a creator, or quite irrational given a strong prior disbelief in a creator. [sent-66, score-0.916]
</p><p>17 But I don’t think argument over H is going to get you anywhere; if your prior beliefs in God are very different, it may be difficult to reconcile your beliefs in evolution versus intelligent design. [sent-68, score-0.938]
</p><p>18 (2) Don’t forget the neglected E|H: if an organism was intelligently designed, the plausibility it looks that way to us. [sent-69, score-0.866]
</p><p>19 In a broader sense, Intelligent Design is simply the science of design detection — how to recognize patterns arranged by an intelligent cause for a purpose. [sent-78, score-0.538]
</p><p>20 An inference that certain biological information may be the product of an intelligent cause can be tested or evaluated in the same manner as scientists daily test for design in other sciences. [sent-80, score-0.702]

<p>Introduction: I was planning to write some  WordNet  lookup code tonight.  But instead I’ve learned of too many intersecting things.
 
First, there are a zillion things to do this weekend ( hooray flavorpill ):
 
  Picasso and American Art  exhibit continuing at  SFMOMA .  I saw it very briefly last weekend but want some more.  And Doug claims there’s an interesting photography exhibit there too.
  Reading from  We Don’t Need Another Wave: Dispatches from the Next Generation of Feminists , a fascinating looking book I’ve seen many times in the bookstores around here.  By that I mean at least Modern Times (the neat Mission bookstore) and the Anarchist Collective Bookstore (out on the Haight).  And the reading is at Modern Times,  just down the street  from my house!  Amazing.  Tomorrow at 7:30.
  Since anarchists were just mentioned, fortuitously there also appears: the  Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair  this Saturday and Sunday!  Speakers and books down by Golden Gate Park, oh my.  

 
Can’t say I’m a ra</p><p>5 0.081787914 <a title="23-tfidf-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2012/brendan_oconnor_ai-2012-07-04-The_%2460%2C000_cat%3A_deep_belief_networks_make_less_sense_for_language_than_vision.html">184 brendan oconnor ai-2012-07-04-The $60,000 cat: deep belief networks make less sense for language than vision</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There was an  interesting ICML paper  this year about very large-scale training of deep belief networks (a.k.a. neural networks) for unsupervised concept extraction from images.  They ( Quoc V. Le  and colleagues at Google/Stanford) have a cute example of learning very high-level features that are evoked by images of cats (from YouTube still-image training data); one is shown below.
 
For those of us who work on machine learning and text, the question always comes up, why not DBN’s for language?  Many shallow latent-space text models have been quite successful (LSI, LDA, HMM, LPCFG…); there is hope that some sort of “deeper” concepts could be learned.  I think this is one of the most interesting areas for unsupervised language modeling right now.
 
But note it’s a bad idea to directly analogize results from image analysis to language analysis.  The problems have radically different levels of conceptual abstraction baked-in.  Consider the problem of detecting the concept of a cat; i.e.</p><p>6 0.076030299 <a title="23-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2006/brendan_oconnor_ai-2006-03-26-new_kind_of_science%2C_for_real.html">32 brendan oconnor ai-2006-03-26-new kind of science, for real</a></p>

Therefore you should believe in God on the off-chance he does exist, since a small chance of something infinitely bad is worse than the alternative.
 
 Believe in Pascal’s Wager?  Have I got a deal for you!  says if you believe it, you should send Alex Tabarrok money because he will put in a good word to God for you.  Hey, there’s a small chance he has a direct line to God, which yields infinite utility (or avoids hell’s infinite disutility).
 
FWIW, I’m thinking the paradoxes in this sort of arithmetic always happen when you start doing addition/multiplication distribution across those darn infinities.  Like on the third page Tabarrok starts talking about p1*Inf – p2*Inf = (p1-p2)*Inf.  That’s shady shit.
 
 And more about the big PW .

<p>Introduction: There was an  interesting ICML paper  this year about very large-scale training of deep belief networks (a.k.a. neural networks) for unsupervised concept extraction from images.  They ( Quoc V. Le  and colleagues at Google/Stanford) have a cute example of learning very high-level features that are evoked by images of cats (from YouTube still-image training data); one is shown below.
 
For those of us who work on machine learning and text, the question always comes up, why not DBN’s for language?  Many shallow latent-space text models have been quite successful (LSI, LDA, HMM, LPCFG…); there is hope that some sort of “deeper” concepts could be learned.  I think this is one of the most interesting areas for unsupervised language modeling right now.
 
But note it’s a bad idea to directly analogize results from image analysis to language analysis.  The problems have radically different levels of conceptual abstraction baked-in.  Consider the problem of detecting the concept of a cat; i.e.</p><p>6 0.20617485 <a title="23-lsi-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2012/brendan_oconnor_ai-2012-07-17-p-values%2C_CDF%E2%80%99s%2C_NLP_etc..html">185 brendan oconnor ai-2012-07-17-p-values, CDF’s, NLP etc.</a></p>

Most of what I know about ID is from seeing a talk by Michael Behe (may 2005).  He had to major lines of argument:  (1) it is implausible that an evolutionary process could produce life that looks as if it was intelligently designed.  (2) Since it looks like it was intelligently designed, it was.  He really emphasized the E component of the argument.
 
Justifications for E: Lots of organisms look like they were intelligently designed.  They have complex and intricate mechanisms involving coordination among many components.  Sometimes they look like things humans would design: for example, bacteria locomotion devices sometimes bear uncanny resemblance to human-designed motors or propellers.

<p>Introduction: A bit ago I finished Daniel Gilbert’s “Stumbling on Happiness,” which despite its name, is not about how to be happy.  It’s about why people are bad at predicting (and remembering) their happiness levels.  (Pop science psychology, not pop psychology… something like that.)  I liked a bit of it mainly because it has an entertaining overview of some cognitive psychology.  A few very interesting happiness experiments get presented, but if your friend tells you about them before you read the book, it’s all over.
 
Perhaps more amusing is stumbling on Gilbert’s quite entertaining appearance on the Colbert Report last week:</p><p>same-blog 3 0.96477103 <a title="23-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-08-01-Bayesian_analysis_of_intelligent_design_%28revised%21%29.html">23 brendan oconnor ai-2005-08-01-Bayesian analysis of intelligent design (revised!)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A common cognitive science view (H. Simon): Heuristics/biases are useful rules-of-thumb to approximate optimizing behavior given computational constraints.
 
Consider the chess-playing heuristic “try not to lose your queen”.  Since you can’t analyze all possible chess moves, it’s nice to have such a rule-of-thumb to narrow down possible actions to consider.  You can reject out of hand an action that leads to losing your queen.  This heuristic helps to approximate optimal chess-playing behavior given your computational constraints.
 
Similarly, moral rules, tendencies, associations, and ontologies are heuristics to approximate socially optimal behavior. “Lying is bad” is a useful rule-of-thumb that usually gets good results for society. Codifying it as a norm — meaning, there’s 3rd party punishment and/or self-punishment (guilt) when it’s violated, thus the rule should get obeyed — is the implementation of a social-level heuristic that generally gives useful behavior.

<p>Introduction: I’ve had several people ask me what the numbers in  ACL  reviews mean — and I can’t find anywhere online where they’re described.  (Can anyone point this out if it is somewhere?)
 
So here’s the review form, below.  They all go from 1 to 5, with 5 the best.  I think the review emails to authors only include a subset of the below — for example, “Overall Recommendation” is not included?
 
The CFP said that they have different types of review forms for different types of papers.  I think this one is for a standard full paper.  I guess what people  really  want to know is what scores tend to correspond to acceptances.  I really have no idea and I get the impression this can change year to year.  I have no involvement with the ACL conference besides being one of many, many reviewers.

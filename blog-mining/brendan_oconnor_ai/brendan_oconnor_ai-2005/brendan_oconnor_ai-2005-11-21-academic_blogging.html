<p>Introduction: A much more slashing commentary from Slate:  
 An op-ed from Sunday’s New York Times, “This Is Your Brain on Politics,” proposes to answer what must be the most vexing question of modern American politics: What’s going on inside the head of a swing voter? The authorsâ€”a team of neuroscientists and political consultantsâ€”ran 20 of these undecided volunteers through a brain scanner and showed them pictures and video of the major candidates from both parties. The results, laid out both in print and an online slide show, purport to give us some insight as to how the upcoming primaries will play out: “Mitt Romney may have some potential,” the researchers conclude, and Hillary Clinton seems to have an edge at winning over her opponents. 
 
Don’t believe a word of it. To liken these neurological pundits to snake-oil salesmen would be far too generous. Their imaging study has not been published in any science journal, nor has it been vetted by experts in the field; it can’t rightly be called</p><p>4 0.10108471 <a title="29-tfidf-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-12-09-Race_and_IQ_debate_%E2%80%93_links.html">85 brendan oconnor ai-2007-12-09-Race and IQ debate – links</a></p>
<p>Introduction: William Saletan, a writer for Slate, recently wrote  a loud series of articles  on genetic racial differences in IQ in the wake of James Watson’s  controversial remarks .  It prompted lots of discussion; here is an  excellent response from Richard Nisbett , a leading authority in the field on the environmentalist side of the debate.
 
More academic articles:  Rushton and Jensen’s 2005 review  of evidence for genetic differences; and what I’ve found to be the most balanced so far, the 1995 APA report  Inteligence: Knowns and Unknowns  which concludes for all the heated claims out there, the scientific evidence tends to be pretty weak.
 
Blog world:  Funny title from Brad DeLong ; and another  Slate response to Saletan and Rushton/Jensen .
 
The politics of the race and intelligence question is a huge distraction from trying to find out the actual truth of the matter.  But I suppose the political implications are why it attracts so much attention — for good or bad.

<p>Introduction: I saw  Seth Roberts  briefly speak today (at an  odd event ) about self-experimentation.  He tried drinking flavorless sugar water and it led him to lose lots of weight.  He also did a great variety of other self-experiments over more than a decade,  written up here  (and IMHO the other ones are much more interesting).
 
I briefly spoke to him there and told him I heard about his work from  Andrew Gelman’s blog .  He seemed surprised to (semi-)randomly meet someone who reads it.  I think this is mistaken — that particular blog seems quite popular in statistics/social science world.  In fact, Gelman’s blogging of Roberts’ self-experimentation paper got picked up by the Freakonomics folks and it became a sensation and then a book deal.  ( Story. )

<p>Introduction: From an  NYT Magazine  article this Sunday, paraphrasing  Isaiah Berlin :
  
 The philosopher Isaiah Berlin once said that the trouble with academics and commentators is that they care more about whether ideas are interesting than whether they are true. Politicians live by ideas just as much as professional thinkers do, but they can’t afford the luxury of entertaining ideas that are merely interesting. They have to work with the small number of ideas that happen to be true and the even smaller number that happen to be applicable to real life. In academic life, false ideas are merely false and useless ones can be fun to play with. In political life, false ideas can ruin the lives of millions and useless ones can waste precious resources. An intellectual’s responsibility for his ideas is to follow their consequences wherever they may lead. A politician’s responsibility is to master those consequences and prevent them from doing harm.
  
I can’t speak for that level of politics, but I’ve</p><p>3 0.62702882 <a title="29-lsi-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-07-09-another_blog%3A_cog_psych_and_political-social_stuff.html">18 brendan oconnor ai-2005-07-09-another blog: cog psych and political-social stuff</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Since blogging is hard, but reading is easy, lately I’ve taken to bookmarking interesting articles I’m reading, with the plan of blogging about them later.  This follow-through has happened a few times, but not that often.  In an amazing moment of thesis procrastination, today I sat down and figured out how to turn my  del.icio.us bookmarks  into a nice blogpost, with the plan that every week a post will appear with links I’ve recently read, or maybe I’ll use the script to generate a draft for myself that I’ll revise, or something.
 
But for this first such link post, I put in a whole bunch of them beyond just the last week — why have just a few when you could have *all* of them?  Future link posts will be shorter, I promise.

<p>Introduction: I thought  Eurovision  was weird enough already.  But in addition to the usual fun mix of kitschy pop and Cold War legacy nationalism in its telephone voting politics, this year will see Finland’s satanic band Lordi: 
 HELSINKI, Finland â€” They have eight-foot retractable latex Satan wings, sing hits like “Chainsaw Buffet” and blow up slabs of smoking meat on stage. So members of the band Lordi expected a reaction when they beat a crooner of love ballads to represent Finland at the Eurovision song contest in Athens, the competition that was the springboard for Abba and Celine Dion. 
 
    
 “In Finland, we have no Eiffel Tower, few real famous artists, it is freezing cold and we suffer from low self-esteem,” said Mr. Putaansuu, who, as Lordi, has horns protruding from his forehead and sports long black fingernails. 
 
As he stuck out his tongue menacingly, his red demon eyes glaring, Lordi was surrounded by Kita, an alien-man-beast predator who plays flame-spitting drums inside a cage</p><p>4 0.0 <a title="29-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2004/brendan_oconnor_ai-2004-11-20-gintis%3A_theoretical_unity_in_the_social_sciences.html">1 brendan oconnor ai-2004-11-20-gintis: theoretical unity in the social sciences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Herbert Gintis thinks  it’s time to unify the behavioral sciences. Sociology, economics, political science, human biology, anthropology and others all study the same thing, but each is based on different incompatible models of individual human behavior. There seems to be evidence that new developments have the potential to offer a more unifying theory. Evolutionary biology should be the basis of understanding much of human behavior. Rational choice and game theoretic frameworks are finding greater acceptance beyond economics; in the meantime, other fields need to absorb sociology’s emphasis on socialization — that people do things or understand the world in a way taught by society. The human behavioral sciences are still rife with many smaller inconsistencies; for example, according to Gintis, only anthropolgists look at the influence of culture across groups, but only sociologists look at culture within groups.
 
Gintis’ ultimate goal is to have a common baseline from which each disci</p><p>5 0.0 <a title="29-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2004/brendan_oconnor_ai-2004-11-24-addiction_%26_2_problems_of_economics.html">2 brendan oconnor ai-2004-11-24-addiction & 2 problems of economics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is my idea based off of  Bernheim and Rangel’s  model of addict decision-making .  It’s a really neat model; it manages to relax rationality to allow someone to do something they don’t want to do because they’re addicted to it.  [Rationality assumes a nice well-ordered set of preferences; this model hypothesizes as distinction between emotional "liking" and cognitive, forward "wanting" that can conflict.]  The model is mathematically tractable, it can be used for public welfare analysis, and to top it off — it’s got neuroscientific grounding!
 
It appears to me there are two big criticisms of the economics discipline’s assumptions.  One of course is rationality.  The second has to do with the perfect structure of the market and environment that shapes both preferences and the ability to exercise them.  One critique is about social structure: consumers are not atomistic individual units, but rather exchange information and ideas along networks of patterned social relations.

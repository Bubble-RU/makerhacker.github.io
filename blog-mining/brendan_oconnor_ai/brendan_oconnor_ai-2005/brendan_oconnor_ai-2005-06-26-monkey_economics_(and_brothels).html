<p>Introduction: Monkeys drink more alcohol when housed alone, and some like to end a long day in the lab with a boozy cocktail, according to a new analysis of alcohol consumption among members of a rhesus macaque social group. … “It was not unusual to see some of the monkeys stumble and fall, sway, and vomit,” Chen added. “In a few of our heavy drinkers, they would drink until they fell asleep.” … In yet another study, the scientists gave a group of male monkeys 24-hour access to the beverage dispensers. According to the researchers, a spike in consumption immediately followed the facilityâ€™s working hours. 
 
“Like humans, monkeys are more likely to drink after stressful periods, such as soon after the daily 8-5 testing hours and after a long week of testing,” said Chen.

<p>Introduction: I wish I knew Hebrew .  Well, fortunately there is also an English article version of  Equilibrium in the Jungle  (Piccione and Rubinstein ’06): 
 In the typical analysis of an exchange economy, agents are involved in consumption and exchange goods voluntarily when mutually beneficial. The endowments and the preferences are the primitives of the model. The distribution of consumption in society is determined endogenously through trade.  
 
This paper is motivated by a complementary perspective on human interaction. Throughout the history of mankind, it has been quite common (and we suspect that it will remain so in the future) that economic agents, individually or collectively, use power to seize control of assets held by others.  The exercise of power is pervasive in every society and takes several forms. Often, power is purely physical. Sometimes, however, power is more gentle.  In the male-female “market”, for example, charm and attraction play a key role in obtaining a favourite ma</p><p>6 0.05826474 <a title="10-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2012/brendan_oconnor_ai-2012-07-17-p-values%2C_CDF%E2%80%99s%2C_NLP_etc..html">185 brendan oconnor ai-2012-07-17-p-values, CDF’s, NLP etc.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I must be too cynical.  I thought I didn’t like  Philip Zimbardo ‘s theatrics, but regardless I really appreciated  this NYT interview  with him on the universal capacity for evil.     (S.P.E. is the  Stanford Prison Experiment , whose pictures here are from that lovely basement hallway, still there behind the 420-40 and 41 lecture rooms.)
 
In particular: 
 Q. What was your reaction when you first saw those photographs from Abu Ghraib? 
 
A. I was shocked. But not surprised. I immediately flashed on similar pictures from the S.P.E. What particularly bothered me was that the Pentagon blamed the whole thing on a “few bad apples.” I knew from our experiment, if you put good apples into a bad situation, you’ll get bad apples.
 
That was why I was willing to be an expert witness for Sgt. Chip Frederick, who was ultimately sentenced to eight years for his role at Abu Ghraib. Frederick was the Army reservist who was put in charge of the night shift at Tier 1A, where detainees were abused.

<p>Introduction: Update Aug 10: THIS IS NOT A SUMMARY OF THE WHOLE PAPER!  it’s whining about one particular method of analysis before talking about other things further down
   
A quick note on  Berg-Kirkpatrick et al EMNLP-2012, “An Empirical Investigation of Statistical Signiﬁcance in NLP” .  They make lots of graphs of p-values against observed magnitudes and talk about “curves”, e.g.
 
 We see the same curve-shaped trend we saw for summarization and dependency parsing. Different group comparisons, same group comparisons, and system combination comparisons form distinct curves. 
 
For example, Figure 2.
 
   
 
I fear they made 10 graphs to rediscover a basic statistical fact: a p-value comes from a null hypothesis CDF.  That’s what these “curve-shaped trends” are in all their graphs.  They are CDFs.
 
To back up, the statistical significance testing question is whether, in their notation, the observed dataset performance difference \(\delta(x)\) is “real” or not: if you were to resample the data,</p><p>6 0.25257859 <a title="10-lsi-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-01-02-The_Jungle_Economy.html">47 brendan oconnor ai-2007-01-02-The Jungle Economy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a fun one: researchers  trained capuchin monkeys to understand tokens as currency  by letting them exchange them for food.  Then they did all sorts of behavioral economics-y tests like finding consistency of preferences revealed in price shocks.  The monkeys even displayed  loss aversion  at rates almost identical to humans!  And along the way they got “prostitution”:
  
Something else happened during that chaotic scene, something that convinced Chen of the monkeysâ€™ true grasp of money. Perhaps the most distinguishing characteristic of money, after all, is its fungibility, the fact that it can be used to buy not just food but anything. During the chaos in the monkey cage, Chen saw something out of the corner of his eye that he would later try to play down but in his heart of hearts he knew to be true. What he witnessed was probably the first observed exchange of money for sex in the history of monkeykind. (Further proof that the monkeys truly understood money: the monkey who</p><p>2 0.91127545 <a title="10-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-05-09-Simpson%E2%80%99s_paradox_is_so_totally_solved.html">60 brendan oconnor ai-2007-05-09-Simpson’s paradox is so totally solved</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My friend Lukas just wrote a great formulation of  Simpson’s Paradox as a puzzle :
  

Against left-handed pitchers, Player A has a higher batting average than Player B.  Player A does better against right-handed pitchers also.


Is it possible that B has a better average than A?

  
Here’s a beautiful ASCII art visualization that says Yes.
 
Each star represents a number of at-bats where the player hit; pluses represent misses.  If you put them in a horizontal line you can see the batting averages (proportions) pretty clearly.  The bar lenghts carry across rows — so a longer bar means more at-bats.
  
Against left-handed pitchers:
A hits |**--| A misses    --> 50% avg.
B hits |*---| B misses    --> 25% avg.

Against right-handed pitchers:
A hits |**|              A misses    --> 100% avg.
B hits |**************-| B misses    -->  93% avg.  (for many more at-bats!)

But, batting against *ALL* pitchers:
A hits  |****--| A misses                 --> 66% avg.
B hits  |*********</p><p>3 0.21387155 <a title="10-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-11-12-Disease_tracking_with_web_queries_and_social_messaging_%28Google%2C_Twitter%2C_Facebook%E2%80%A6%29.html">123 brendan oconnor ai-2008-11-12-Disease tracking with web queries and social messaging (Google, Twitter, Facebook…)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a good idea: in a search engine’s query logs, look for outbreaks of queries like [[flu symptoms]] in a given region.  I’ve heard (from  Roddy ) that this trick also works well on Facebook statuses (e.g. “Feeling crappy this morning, think I just got the flu”).
  
  Google Uses Web Searches to Track Flu’s Spread – NYTimes.com  
  Google Flu Trends – google.org  
  
For an example with a publicly available data feed, these queries works decently well on Twitter search:
 
 [[ flu -shot -google ]]  (high recall)
 
 [[ "muscle aches" flu -shot ]]  (high precision)
     
 
The “muscle aches” query is too sparse and the general query is too noisy, but you could imagine some more tricks to clean it up, then train a classifier, etc.  With a bit more work it looks like geolocation information can be had out of the  Twitter search API .</p><p>4 0.21202132 <a title="10-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2014/brendan_oconnor_ai-2014-02-19-What_the_ACL-2014_review_scores_mean.html">203 brendan oconnor ai-2014-02-19-What the ACL-2014 review scores mean</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve had several people ask me what the numbers in  ACL  reviews mean — and I can’t find anywhere online where they’re described.  (Can anyone point this out if it is somewhere?)
 
So here’s the review form, below.  They all go from 1 to 5, with 5 the best.  I think the review emails to authors only include a subset of the below — for example, “Overall Recommendation” is not included?
 
The CFP said that they have different types of review forms for different types of papers.  I think this one is for a standard full paper.  I guess what people  really  want to know is what scores tend to correspond to acceptances.  I really have no idea and I get the impression this can change year to year.  I have no involvement with the ACL conference besides being one of many, many reviewers.
 
  
  
APPROPRIATENESS (1-5)
Does the paper fit in ACL 2014? (Please answer this question in light of the desire to broaden the scope of the research areas represented at ACL.)

<p>Introduction: I don’t care how lame anyone thinks this is, but economic theorist  Ariel Rubinstein  is the shit.  He’s funny, self-deprecating, and brilliant.  I was just re-reading  his delightful, sarcastic review of Freakonomics .  (Overly dramatized visual depiction below; hey, conflict sells.)
 
    The review consists of excerpts from his own upcoming super-worldwide-bestseller, “Freak-Freakonomics”.  It is full of golden quotes such as: 
  Chapter 2: Why do economists earn more than mathematicians?  
 
…
 
The comparison between architects and prostitutes can be applied to mathematicians and economists: The former are more skilled, highly educated and intelligent.  
 
To elaborate: 
 Levitt has never encountered a girl who dreams of being a prostitute and I have never met a child who dreams of being an economist. Like prostitutes, the skill required of economists is “not necessarily ‘specialized’” (106). And, finally, here is a new explanation for the salary gap between mathematicians and eco</p><p>6 0.2098083 <a title="10-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-09-02-cognitive_modelling_is_rational_choice%2B%2B.html">26 brendan oconnor ai-2005-09-02-cognitive modelling is rational choice++</a></p>

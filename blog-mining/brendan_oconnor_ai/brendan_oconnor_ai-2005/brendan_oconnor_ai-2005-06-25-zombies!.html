<p>Introduction: Richard Rorty, philosopher, dies at 75 .
 
I’ve read enough of the analytic philosophers castigating Rorty — and taken bits of classes from a few of them — that I feel I just have to love the man.
 
I remember managing to see him speak twice.  Once was on philosophy of mind at the good ol’ Sym Sys Forum.   (Video!)   (“He is wrong, but wrong in such an interesting way!” I remember one comment.)
 
Most fascinating was when he gamely participated in a discussion at this very odd Christian thought conference some groups on campus put together.  (The Veritas Forum,  here’s a link .)  He was standing there, arguing with the Christian conservatives about the nature and legitimacy of authority, but humorously ceding ground where appropriate… “Look, it’s not that all children will be active critical thinkers and discover everything for themselves.  Getting a kid a secular liberal education isn’t that much different than any other education — you have to beat it in to them.”  (That is a paraphr</p><p>4 0.076607823 <a title="9-tfidf-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2006/brendan_oconnor_ai-2006-08-30-A_big%2C_fun_list_of_links_I%E2%80%99m_reading.html">44 brendan oconnor ai-2006-08-30-A big, fun list of links I’m reading</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since blogging is hard, but reading is easy, lately I’ve taken to bookmarking interesting articles I’m reading, with the plan of blogging about them later.  This follow-through has happened a few times, but not that often.  In an amazing moment of thesis procrastination, today I sat down and figured out how to turn my  del.icio.us bookmarks  into a nice blogpost, with the plan that every week a post will appear with links I’ve recently read, or maybe I’ll use the script to generate a draft for myself that I’ll revise, or something.
 
But for this first such link post, I put in a whole bunch of them beyond just the last week — why have just a few when you could have *all* of them?  Future link posts will be shorter, I promise.

<p>Introduction: Here are two great reviews, from 2003 then 2005.
 
1)  PLoS Biology: Economy of the Mind  nicely reviews the field and many interesting experiments.
 
One annoyance: They need to say “Banburismus” is more commonly known as Bayesian learning.  (Banbury, England was a city near Bletchley Park they got their paper from when doing Bayesian statistical codebreaking of the Enigma cipher in World War II.   Read the story here  in MacKay’s excellent free online  textbook .)   Thanks to  neurodudes  for the PLoS link.
 
2)  Neuroeconomics: How neuroscience can inform economics  is written by the leaders of the field, advocating their approach.  I like the detail and their careful descriptions of how cognitive neuroscience findings can enhance our understanding of economic phenomena.
 
Also, the second is useful to read since it’s the target of criticism by the more recent  The case for mindless economics , which I view as an empire-strikes-back sort of paper.

<p>Introduction: Experimental philosophy:  
 Suppose the chairman of a company has to decide whether to adopt a new program. It would increase profits and help the environment too. “I don’t care at all about helping the environment,” the chairman says. “I just want to make as much profit as I can. Let’s start the new program.” Would you say that the chairman intended to help the environment? 
 
O.K., same circumstance. Except this time the program would harm the environment. The chairman, who still couldn’t care less about the environment, authorizes the program in order to get those profits. As expected, the bottom line goes up, the environment goes down. Would you say the chairman harmed the environment intentionally?
 
in one survey, only 23 percent of people said that the chairman in the first situation had intentionally helped the environment. When they had to think about the second situation, though, fully 82 percent thought that the chairman had intentionally harmed the environment.

<p>Introduction: I love this  Daily Show clip with Alan Greenspan .  On emotion and economic forecasting.  From 2007.
 
   
  
GREENSPAN: 
I’ve been dealing with these big mathematical models of forecasting the economy, and I’m looking at what’s going on in the last few weeks. … If I could figure out a way to determine whether or not people are more fearful or changing to more euphoric … I don’t need any of this other stuff.  I could forecast the economy better than any way I know.


The trouble is that we can’t figure that out. I’ve been in the forecasting business for 50 years. … I’m no better than I ever was, and nobody else is. Forecasting 50 years ago was as good or as bad as it is today. And the reason is that human nature hasn’t changed. We can’t improve ourselves.”


STEWART: 
You just bummed the [bleep] out of me.
  
I’ve seen it in two separate talks now, from  Peter Dodds  (co-author of  “Measuring the Happiness of Large-Scale Written Expression” ) and  Eric Gilbert  (co-author of  “Widespre</p><p>3 0.047470354 <a title="9-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2006/brendan_oconnor_ai-2006-06-03-Neuroeconomics_reviews.html">38 brendan oconnor ai-2006-06-03-Neuroeconomics reviews</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here are two great reviews, from 2003 then 2005.
 
1)  PLoS Biology: Economy of the Mind  nicely reviews the field and many interesting experiments.
 
One annoyance: They need to say “Banburismus” is more commonly known as Bayesian learning.  (Banbury, England was a city near Bletchley Park they got their paper from when doing Bayesian statistical codebreaking of the Enigma cipher in World War II.   Read the story here  in MacKay’s excellent free online  textbook .)   Thanks to  neurodudes  for the PLoS link.
 
2)  Neuroeconomics: How neuroscience can inform economics  is written by the leaders of the field, advocating their approach.  I like the detail and their careful descriptions of how cognitive neuroscience findings can enhance our understanding of economic phenomena.
 
Also, the second is useful to read since it’s the target of criticism by the more recent  The case for mindless economics , which I view as an empire-strikes-back sort of paper.  I’m waiting for Part III of this s</p><p>4 0.02345556 <a title="9-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2006/brendan_oconnor_ai-2006-04-24-The_identity_politics_of_satananic_zombie_alien_man-beasts.html">33 brendan oconnor ai-2006-04-24-The identity politics of satananic zombie alien man-beasts</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I thought  Eurovision  was weird enough already.  But in addition to the usual fun mix of kitschy pop and Cold War legacy nationalism in its telephone voting politics, this year will see Finland’s satanic band Lordi: 
 HELSINKI, Finland â€” They have eight-foot retractable latex Satan wings, sing hits like “Chainsaw Buffet” and blow up slabs of smoking meat on stage. So members of the band Lordi expected a reaction when they beat a crooner of love ballads to represent Finland at the Eurovision song contest in Athens, the competition that was the springboard for Abba and Celine Dion. 
 
    
 “In Finland, we have no Eiffel Tower, few real famous artists, it is freezing cold and we suffer from low self-esteem,” said Mr. Putaansuu, who, as Lordi, has horns protruding from his forehead and sports long black fingernails. 
 
As he stuck out his tongue menacingly, his red demon eyes glaring, Lordi was surrounded by Kita, an alien-man-beast predator who plays flame-spitting drums inside a cage</p><p>5 0.021430671 <a title="9-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-09-26-EEG_for_the_Wii_and_in_your_basement.html">78 brendan oconnor ai-2007-09-26-EEG for the Wii and in your basement</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There’s a company,  Emotiv , that’s building an  EEG  interface for the game systems.  Any company with a  science-fiction-y vision statement  sounds like a good time to me:
  
Communication between man and machine has always been limited to conscious interaction, with non-conscious communication — expression, intuition, perception — reserved solely for the human realm. At Emotiv, we believe that future communication between man and machine will not only be limited to the conscious communication that exists today, but non-conscious communication will play a significant part.


Our mission is to create the ultimate interface for the next-generation of man-machine interaction, by evolving the interaction between human beings and electronic devices beyond the limits of conscious interface. Emotiv is creating technologies that allow machines to take both conscious and non-conscious inputs directly from your mind.
  
They even have a cyborg-looking woman on the page.

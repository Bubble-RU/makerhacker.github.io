<p>Introduction: I think I believe one of these things, but I’m not quite sure. 
 Statistics is just like logic, except with uncertainty. 
 
This would be true if statistics is Bayesian statistics and you buy the Bayesian inductive logic story — add induction to propositional logic, via a conditional credibility operator, and the Cox axioms imply standard probability theory as a consequence.  (That is, probability theory is logic with uncertainty.  And then a good Bayesian thinks probability theory and statistics are the same.)  Links:  Jaynes’ explanation ;  SEP article ; also  Fitelson’s article .  (Though there are negative results; all I can think of right now is a  Halpern  article on Cox; and also interesting is  Halpern and Koller .)
 
Secondly, here is another statement.
  

Statistics is just like logic, except with a big N.

  
This is a more data-driven view — the world is full of things and they need to be described.

<p>Introduction: There are an increasing number of systems that attempt to allow the user to specify a probabilistic model in a high-level language — for example, declare a (Bayesian) generative model as a hierarchy of various distributions — then automatically run training and inference algorithms on a data set.  Now, you could always learn a good math library, and implement every model from scratch, but the motivation for this approach is you’ll avoid doing lots of repetitive and error-prone programming.

<p>Introduction: This is my idea based off of  Bernheim and Rangel’s  model of addict decision-making .  It’s a really neat model; it manages to relax rationality to allow someone to do something they don’t want to do because they’re addicted to it.  [Rationality assumes a nice well-ordered set of preferences; this model hypothesizes as distinction between emotional "liking" and cognitive, forward "wanting" that can conflict.]  The model is mathematically tractable, it can be used for public welfare analysis, and to top it off — it’s got neuroscientific grounding!
 
It appears to me there are two big criticisms of the economics discipline’s assumptions.  One of course is rationality.  The second has to do with the perfect structure of the market and environment that shapes both preferences and the ability to exercise them.  One critique is about social structure: consumers are not atomistic individual units, but rather exchange information and ideas along networks of patterned social relations.

<p>Introduction: re  @andrewparker :
  
 My iPhone auto-corrected “Harvard” to “Garbage”. Well played Apple engineers. 
  
I was wondering how this would happen, and then noticed that each character pair has 0 to 2 distance on the QWERTY keyboard.  Perhaps their model is eager to allow QWERTY-local character substitutions.
  
 
>>> zip(‘harvard’,'garbage’) 
[('h', 'g'), ('a', 'a'), ('r', 'r'), ('v', 'b'), ('a', 'a'), ('r', 'g'), ('d', 'e')]
 
  
And then most any language model thinks p(“garbage”) > p(“harvard”), at the very least in a unigram model with a broad domain corpus.  So if it’s a noisy channel-style model, they’re underpenalizing the edit distance relative to the LM prior.  (Reference:  Norvig’s noisy channel spelling correction article .)
 
On the other hand, given how  insane iPhone autocorrections are , and from the number of times I’ve seen it delete a quite reasonable word I wrote, I’d bet “harvard” isn’t even in their LM.  (Where the LM is more like just a dictionary; call it quantizin</p><p>6 0.098354541 <a title="11-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2010/brendan_oconnor_ai-2010-08-09-An_ML-AI_approach_to_P_%21%3D_NP.html">161 brendan oconnor ai-2010-08-09-An ML-AI approach to P != NP</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Like everyone, I’ve been just starting to look at the new, tentative,  proof that P != NP  from Vinay Deolalikar.  After reading the intro, what’s most striking is that probabilistic graphical models and mathematical logic are at the core of the proof.  This feels like a machine learning and artificial intelligence-centric approach to me — very different from what you usually see in mainstream CS theory.  (Maybe I should feel good that in my undergrad I basically stopped studying normal math and spent all my time with this weird stuff instead!)
 
He devotes several chapters to an introduction to graphical models — Ising models, conditional independence, MRF’s, Hammersley-Clifford, and all that other stuff you see in  Koller and Friedman  or something — and then logic and model theory!  I’m impressed.</p><p>3 0.60517389 <a title="11-lsi-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-12-31-List_of_probabilistic_model_mini-language_toolkits.html">157 brendan oconnor ai-2009-12-31-List of probabilistic model mini-language toolkits</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It’s a human political belief model — based on Cyc!  I’m not sure logic represents how people think all that well, but seeing the formalization of ideology is fascinating.  And besides, the methodology of cognitive modelling is awesome.   The link:  
 Modeling How People Think About Sustainability 
 
David C. James, M. P. Aff
 
LBJ School of Public Affairs The University of Texas at Austin May 2005
 
First Reader: Lodis Rhodes  Second Reader: Chandler Stolp
 
How effectively can a computer model represent the belief systems of different people? How would one go about representing a belief system using formal logic? How would that ideology react to different scenarios related to sustainable development? The author constructs the Cyc Agent-Scenario (CAS) model as a way to investigate these questions. The CAS model is built on top of ResearchCyc, a knowledge base (KB) and logical inference engine. The model consists of two agents (Libertarian and Green) and two scenarios.

<p>Introduction: I’ve had several people ask me what the numbers in  ACL  reviews mean — and I can’t find anywhere online where they’re described.  (Can anyone point this out if it is somewhere?)
 
So here’s the review form, below.  They all go from 1 to 5, with 5 the best.  I think the review emails to authors only include a subset of the below — for example, “Overall Recommendation” is not included?
 
The CFP said that they have different types of review forms for different types of papers.  I think this one is for a standard full paper.  I guess what people  really  want to know is what scores tend to correspond to acceptances.  I really have no idea and I get the impression this can change year to year.  I have no involvement with the ACL conference besides being one of many, many reviewers.
 
  
  
APPROPRIATENESS (1-5)
Does the paper fit in ACL 2014? (Please answer this question in light of the desire to broaden the scope of the research areas represented at ACL.)

<p>Introduction: Rational choice has been a huge imperialistic success, growing in popularity and being applied to more and more fields.  Why is this?  It’s not because the rational choice model of decision-making is particularly realistic.  Rather, it’s because rational choice is a  completely specified theory of human behavior , and therefore is great at generating hypotheses.  Given any situation involving people, rational choice can be used to generate a hypothesis about what to expect.  That is, you just ask, “What would a person do to maximize their own benefit?”
 
Similar things have been said about evolutionary psychology: you can always predict behavior by asking “what would hunter-gatherers do?”  Now, certainly both rational choice and evolutionary psychology don’t always generate  correct  hypotheses, but they’re incredibly useful because they at least give you a starting point.
 
Witness the theory of bounded rationality: just like rational choice, except amended to consider computational l</p><p>4 0.23414792 <a title="11-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-09-15-Dollar_auction.html">77 brendan oconnor ai-2007-09-15-Dollar auction</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I got nervous and panicky just reading about this game.  I wonder if I could con some people into playing it.
  
Economics professors have a standard game they use to demonstrate how apparently rational decisions can create a disastrous result. They call it a “dollar auction.” The rules are simple. The professor offers a dollar for sale to the highest bidder, with only one wrinkle: the second-highest bidder has to pay up on their losing bid as well. Several students almost always get sucked in. The first bids a penny, looking to make 99 cents. The second bids 2 cents, the third 3 cents, and so on, each feeling they have a chance at something good on the cheap. The early stages are fun, and the bidders wonder what possessed the professor to be willing to lose some money.


The problem surfaces when the bidders get up close to a dollar. After 99 cents the last vestige of profitability disappears, but the bidding continues between the two highest players. They now realize that they stand</p><p>5 0.23363625 <a title="11-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-06-10-Freak-Freakonomics_%28Ariel_Rubinstein_is_the_shit%21%29.html">63 brendan oconnor ai-2007-06-10-Freak-Freakonomics (Ariel Rubinstein is the shit!)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I don’t care how lame anyone thinks this is, but economic theorist  Ariel Rubinstein  is the shit.  He’s funny, self-deprecating, and brilliant.  I was just re-reading  his delightful, sarcastic review of Freakonomics .  (Overly dramatized visual depiction below; hey, conflict sells.)
 
    The review consists of excerpts from his own upcoming super-worldwide-bestseller, “Freak-Freakonomics”.  It is full of golden quotes such as: 
  Chapter 2: Why do economists earn more than mathematicians?  
 
…
 
The comparison between architects and prostitutes can be applied to mathematicians and economists: The former are more skilled, highly educated and intelligent.  
 
To elaborate: 
 Levitt has never encountered a girl who dreams of being a prostitute and I have never met a child who dreams of being an economist. Like prostitutes, the skill required of economists is “not necessarily ‘specialized’” (106). And, finally, here is a new explanation for the salary gap between mathematicians and eco</p><p>6 0.23242728 <a title="11-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-07-09-the_psychology_of_design_as_explanation.html">19 brendan oconnor ai-2005-07-09-the psychology of design as explanation</a></p>

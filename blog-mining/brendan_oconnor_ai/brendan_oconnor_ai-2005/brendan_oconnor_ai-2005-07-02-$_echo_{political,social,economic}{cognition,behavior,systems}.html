<p>Introduction: I was planning to write some  WordNet  lookup code tonight.  But instead I’ve learned of too many intersecting things.
 
First, there are a zillion things to do this weekend ( hooray flavorpill ):
 
  Picasso and American Art  exhibit continuing at  SFMOMA .  I saw it very briefly last weekend but want some more.  And Doug claims there’s an interesting photography exhibit there too.
  Reading from  We Don’t Need Another Wave: Dispatches from the Next Generation of Feminists , a fascinating looking book I’ve seen many times in the bookstores around here.  By that I mean at least Modern Times (the neat Mission bookstore) and the Anarchist Collective Bookstore (out on the Haight).  And the reading is at Modern Times,  just down the street  from my house!  Amazing.  Tomorrow at 7:30.
  Since anarchists were just mentioned, fortuitously there also appears: the  Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair  this Saturday and Sunday!  Speakers and books down by Golden Gate Park, oh my.

<p>Introduction: From an  NYT Magazine  article this Sunday, paraphrasing  Isaiah Berlin :
  
 The philosopher Isaiah Berlin once said that the trouble with academics and commentators is that they care more about whether ideas are interesting than whether they are true. Politicians live by ideas just as much as professional thinkers do, but they can’t afford the luxury of entertaining ideas that are merely interesting. They have to work with the small number of ideas that happen to be true and the even smaller number that happen to be applicable to real life. In academic life, false ideas are merely false and useless ones can be fun to play with. In political life, false ideas can ruin the lives of millions and useless ones can waste precious resources. An intellectual’s responsibility for his ideas is to follow their consequences wherever they may lead. A politician’s responsibility is to master those consequences and prevent them from doing harm.
  
I can’t speak for that level of politics, but I’ve</p><p>4 0.077356845 <a title="12-tfidf-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-10-31-neo_institutional_economic_fun%21.html">80 brendan oconnor ai-2007-10-31-neo institutional economic fun!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: [Like medieval Christian societies,] Islamic societies similarly found ingenious ways to circumvent the usury ban.  The primary one was the  double sale .  In this transaction, the borrower would get, for example, both 100 dinars cash and a small piece of cloth valued at the absurdly high price of 15 dinars.  In a year he would have to pay back 100 dinars for the loan of the cash and 15 for the cloth.  These debts were upheld by Sharia courts.
  
The cognition of rules and ethics sure is complex.  I’d love to read the reasoning from those courts.
 
From from Gregory Clark’s  rather intense review  of  Avner Greif ‘s new-ish book on institutional economics.  (Clark’s the one who wrote that  interesting but weird  evolutionary argument about European economic development.)  If you’re in to the little worlds of institutional, evolutionary, and behavioral economics, Greif’s work is really interesting.

<p>Introduction: MySpace and the  Commission on the Presidential Debates  put together a neat site,  mydebates.org , which presents the candidates’ positions through various mini-polls and such.  It even has a cool data exploration tool for the poll results … for example, here are two support maps, one for respondents over 65 and one for 18-24 year olds.
 
   
 
    Anyway, the site also takes submissions of questions for tonight’s debate.  Apparently  six million  questions were submitted, and moderator Tom Brokaw will of course use only 10 or so.  This begs a question, how were they selected?  There’s no Digg-like social filtering or anything.  You could imagine automatic methods to help narrow down the pool: Topic clustering?  Quality ranking on syntax and vocabulary?
 
 Eric Fish  suggested the obvious: probably someone picked 1000 randomly and sent them to Brokaw.
 
I’d love to see a corpus of 6 million questions on U.S. political subjects, directed at only two different people.

<p>Introduction: The current subtitle is “where {political, social, economic} crosses {cognition, behavior, systems}”.  Amusingly enough, this syntax on a unix shell actually gets you the 9 combinations:
  ~% echo {political,social,economic}{cognition,behavior,systems}
politicalcognition politicalbehavior politicalsystems
socialcognition socialbehavior socialsystems economiccognition
economicbehavior economicsystems

<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: Since blogging is hard, but reading is easy, lately I’ve taken to bookmarking interesting articles I’m reading, with the plan of blogging about them later.  This follow-through has happened a few times, but not that often.  In an amazing moment of thesis procrastination, today I sat down and figured out how to turn my  del.icio.us bookmarks  into a nice blogpost, with the plan that every week a post will appear with links I’ve recently read, or maybe I’ll use the script to generate a draft for myself that I’ll revise, or something.
 
But for this first such link post, I put in a whole bunch of them beyond just the last week — why have just a few when you could have *all* of them?  Future link posts will be shorter, I promise.

<p>Introduction: There’s a lot to say about  Powerset , the short-lived natural language search company (2005-2008) where I worked after college.  AI overhype, flying too close to the sun, the psychology of tech journalism and venture capitalism, etc.  A year or two ago I wrote the following bit about Powerset’s technology in response to a question  on Quora .  I’m posting a revised version here.
 
 Question:  What was Powerset’s core innovation in search?  As far as I can tell, they licensed an NLP engine. They did not have a question answering system or any system for information extraction. How was Powerset’s search engine different than Google’s?
 
 My answer:  Powerset built a system vaguely like a question-answering system on top of Xerox PARC’s NLP engine.  The output is better described as query-focused summarization rather than question answering; primarily, it matched semantic fragments of the user query against indexed semantic relations, with lots of keyword/ngram-matching fallback for when</p><p>5 0.18181068 <a title="12-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2014/brendan_oconnor_ai-2014-02-19-What_the_ACL-2014_review_scores_mean.html">203 brendan oconnor ai-2014-02-19-What the ACL-2014 review scores mean</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve had several people ask me what the numbers in  ACL  reviews mean — and I can’t find anywhere online where they’re described.  (Can anyone point this out if it is somewhere?)
 
So here’s the review form, below.  They all go from 1 to 5, with 5 the best.  I think the review emails to authors only include a subset of the below — for example, “Overall Recommendation” is not included?
 
The CFP said that they have different types of review forms for different types of papers.  I think this one is for a standard full paper.  I guess what people  really  want to know is what scores tend to correspond to acceptances.  I really have no idea and I get the impression this can change year to year.  I have no involvement with the ACL conference besides being one of many, many reviewers.

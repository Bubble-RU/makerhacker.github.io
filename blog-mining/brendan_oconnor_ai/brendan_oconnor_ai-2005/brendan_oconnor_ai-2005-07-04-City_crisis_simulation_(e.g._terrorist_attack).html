<p>Introduction: This is my idea based off of  Bernheim and Rangel’s  model of addict decision-making .  It’s a really neat model; it manages to relax rationality to allow someone to do something they don’t want to do because they’re addicted to it.  [Rationality assumes a nice well-ordered set of preferences; this model hypothesizes as distinction between emotional "liking" and cognitive, forward "wanting" that can conflict.]  The model is mathematically tractable, it can be used for public welfare analysis, and to top it off — it’s got neuroscientific grounding!
 
It appears to me there are two big criticisms of the economics discipline’s assumptions.  One of course is rationality.  The second has to do with the perfect structure of the market and environment that shapes both preferences and the ability to exercise them.  One critique is about social structure: consumers are not atomistic individual units, but rather exchange information and ideas along networks of patterned social relations.

<p>Introduction: I’ve been a big fan of Reddit’s  Programing  subsite for a while.  Just this morning I found another sub-reddit:  SYSOR: Systems Science, Operations Research and Everything In Between , and I’m loving it.  Lots of links on data mining, graph software, image recognition, learning theory, etc etc.
 
Not sure if the Operations Research part in the title is so big now — there’s some sort of complicated reorganization of a number of fields including operations research, systems science, computational learning, and more general computer science areas.  I’m a fan of the great historical overview in the Introduction in  Rusell and Norvig’s AI book ; I’m sure it’s slanted in various ways, but what else are overarching narratives for?  :)</p><p>4 0.48532388 <a title="14-lsi-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-11-20-science_writing_bad%21.html">28 brendan oconnor ai-2005-11-20-science writing bad!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I started reading Jeffrey Sachs’ new book  The End of Poverty .  The first 30 pages are excellent, but it starts getting arrogant and annoying quick.  Substantively, I’m uncertain whether a big new development aid push will solve things.
 
Since I enthusiastically bum around course websites I’m not taking (bad habit, will stop real soon now), I was fortunate to run across an excellent debate between Sachs and William Easterly:
 
 Easterly’s view on Africa: The West Can’t Take The Lead  which has some amazing anecdotes about African educators and entrepreneurs.  (Or, I think they’re amazing only because I’m a condescending Westerner?)
 
 Easterly reviews Sachs .  Choice quote: 
 “Success in ending the poverty trap,” Sachs writes, “will be much easier than it appears.” Really? If it’s so easy, why haven’t five decades of effort gotten the job done? Sachs should redirect some of his outrage at the question of why the previous $2.3 trillion didn’t reach the poor so that the next $2.3 trill</p><p>same-blog 3 0.9370712 <a title="14-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-07-04-City_crisis_simulation_%28e.g._terrorist_attack%29.html">14 brendan oconnor ai-2005-07-04-City crisis simulation (e.g. terrorist attack)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: WP:  Computers simulate terrorist extremes 
 
Los Alamos scientists are running terrorist attack/response simulations. Well, the article title is misleading, they’re not simulating terrorists (which would pose a whole set of interesting questions about scientific knowledge, social construction and security), but rather, the impact on telecomm, health, and infrastructure systems.  They’re using the standard justifications for systems simulation: these are big, highly complex, highly interdependent systems that are ill-understood and have had drastic domino-effect collapses before (like the northeast power blackout).
 
The article also talks about epidemiology simulations (smallpox in this case, following the terrorist scenario again) that take into account the interactions of individual people with each other — very much along the lines of agent-based simulations, and satisfying complexity theory’s arguments about tipping points and emergent effects.  [The article doesn't seem to say wh</p><p>4 0.19937949 <a title="14-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2014/brendan_oconnor_ai-2014-02-19-What_the_ACL-2014_review_scores_mean.html">203 brendan oconnor ai-2014-02-19-What the ACL-2014 review scores mean</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve had several people ask me what the numbers in  ACL  reviews mean — and I can’t find anywhere online where they’re described.  (Can anyone point this out if it is somewhere?)
 
So here’s the review form, below.  They all go from 1 to 5, with 5 the best.  I think the review emails to authors only include a subset of the below — for example, “Overall Recommendation” is not included?
 
The CFP said that they have different types of review forms for different types of papers.  I think this one is for a standard full paper.  I guess what people  really  want to know is what scores tend to correspond to acceptances.  I really have no idea and I get the impression this can change year to year.  I have no involvement with the ACL conference besides being one of many, many reviewers.
 
  
  
APPROPRIATENESS (1-5)
Does the paper fit in ACL 2014? (Please answer this question in light of the desire to broaden the scope of the research areas represented at ACL.)

<p>Introduction: This is a good idea: in a search engine’s query logs, look for outbreaks of queries like [[flu symptoms]] in a given region.  I’ve heard (from  Roddy ) that this trick also works well on Facebook statuses (e.g. “Feeling crappy this morning, think I just got the flu”).
  
  Google Uses Web Searches to Track Flu’s Spread – NYTimes.com  
  Google Flu Trends – google.org  
  
For an example with a publicly available data feed, these queries works decently well on Twitter search:
 
 [[ flu -shot -google ]]  (high recall)
 
 [[ "muscle aches" flu -shot ]]  (high precision)
     
 
The “muscle aches” query is too sparse and the general query is too noisy, but you could imagine some more tricks to clean it up, then train a classifier, etc.  With a bit more work it looks like geolocation information can be had out of the  Twitter search API .</p><p>6 0.19388428 <a title="14-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-09-02-cognitive_modelling_is_rational_choice%2B%2B.html">26 brendan oconnor ai-2005-09-02-cognitive modelling is rational choice++</a></p>

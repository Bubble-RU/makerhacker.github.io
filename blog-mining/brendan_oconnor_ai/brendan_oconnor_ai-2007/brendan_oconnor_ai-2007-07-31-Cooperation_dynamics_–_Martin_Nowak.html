<p>Introduction: [Like medieval Christian societies,] Islamic societies similarly found ingenious ways to circumvent the usury ban.  The primary one was the  double sale .  In this transaction, the borrower would get, for example, both 100 dinars cash and a small piece of cloth valued at the absurdly high price of 15 dinars.  In a year he would have to pay back 100 dinars for the loan of the cash and 15 for the cloth.  These debts were upheld by Sharia courts.
  
The cognition of rules and ethics sure is complex.  I’d love to read the reasoning from those courts.

<p>Introduction: Just read an interesting analysis on the the simultaneous rise of the cultural left and right (“hippies and evangelicals”) through the 50′s and 60′s.   Brink Lindsey argues here  that they were both reactions to post-war material prosperity:
  
On the left gathered those who were most alive to the new possibilities created by the unprecedented mass affluence of the postwar years but at the same time were hostile to the social institutions — namely, the market and the middle-class work ethic — that created those possibilities. On the right rallied those who staunchly supported the institutions that created prosperity but who shrank from the social dynamism they were unleashing. One side denounced capitalism but gobbled its fruits; the other cursed the fruits while defending the system that bore them. Both causes were quixotic, and consequently neither fully realized its ambitions.

<p>Introduction: Looks like it’s become a mini-series: Jared Diamond’s  Guns, Germs, and Steel has hit PBS!   Great book, if repetitive and a little too ambitious — he has a great environmental/technology explanation of the differences in societal development between Europe and the Americas, but he’s pretty weak when trying to tackle Asia vs. Europe, or a number of other situations talked about near the end of the book.  But anyway, it’s fantastic social science.
 
Wish I had a TV around… it would be nice if the show made it onto the web.  For some time, I remember hearing that all of  Commanding Heights  was available for free on the web, but it looks like they’ve taken it down.

<p>Introduction: Standard problem: humans lived like crap for thousands and thousands of years, then suddenly some two hundred years ago dramatic industrialization and economic growth happened, though unevenly even through today.  Here’s  an interesting proposal  to explain all this.   Gregory Clark  found startling empirical evidence that, in the time around the Industrial Revolution in England, wealthier families had more children than poorer families, while middle-class social values — non-violence, literacy, work ethic, high savings rates — also became more widespread during this time.  According to the article at least, he actually seems to favor the explanation that human biological evolution was at work; though he notes cultural evolution is possible too.  (That is, the children of wealthier families are socialized with their values; as the children of middle-class-valued families increase in proportion in society, the prevalence of those values increases too.)
 
In any case, the argument is tha</p><p>5 0.36821046 <a title="72-lsi-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-06-29-Evangelicals_vs._Aquarians.html">66 brendan oconnor ai-2007-06-29-Evangelicals vs. Aquarians</a></p>

<p>Introduction: re  @andrewparker :
  
 My iPhone auto-corrected “Harvard” to “Garbage”. Well played Apple engineers. 
  
I was wondering how this would happen, and then noticed that each character pair has 0 to 2 distance on the QWERTY keyboard.  Perhaps their model is eager to allow QWERTY-local character substitutions.
  
 
>>> zip(‘harvard’,'garbage’) 
[('h', 'g'), ('a', 'a'), ('r', 'r'), ('v', 'b'), ('a', 'a'), ('r', 'g'), ('d', 'e')]
 
  
And then most any language model thinks p(“garbage”) > p(“harvard”), at the very least in a unigram model with a broad domain corpus.  So if it’s a noisy channel-style model, they’re underpenalizing the edit distance relative to the LM prior.  (Reference:  Norvig’s noisy channel spelling correction article .)
 
On the other hand, given how  insane iPhone autocorrections are , and from the number of times I’ve seen it delete a quite reasonable word I wrote, I’d bet “harvard” isn’t even in their LM.  (Where the LM is more like just a dictionary; call it quantizin</p><p>3 0.43194935 <a title="72-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2004/brendan_oconnor_ai-2004-11-24-addiction_%26_2_problems_of_economics.html">2 brendan oconnor ai-2004-11-24-addiction & 2 problems of economics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is my idea based off of  Bernheim and Rangel’s  model of addict decision-making .  It’s a really neat model; it manages to relax rationality to allow someone to do something they don’t want to do because they’re addicted to it.  [Rationality assumes a nice well-ordered set of preferences; this model hypothesizes as distinction between emotional "liking" and cognitive, forward "wanting" that can conflict.]  The model is mathematically tractable, it can be used for public welfare analysis, and to top it off — it’s got neuroscientific grounding!
 
It appears to me there are two big criticisms of the economics discipline’s assumptions.  One of course is rationality.  The second has to do with the perfect structure of the market and environment that shapes both preferences and the ability to exercise them.  One critique is about social structure: consumers are not atomistic individual units, but rather exchange information and ideas along networks of patterned social relations.

<p>Introduction: This is off-topic for this blog but here goes.   ConnectU , a small college social networking site, has been in the news due to their  apparently weak lawsuit against Facebook , in which they claim  Mark Zuckerberg  stole their business plan and computer code back when they all were Harvard undergraduates.  (Judges involved have noted the case’s flimsy evidence; some technology commentators — as well as everyone I know — have noted that the business idea wasn’t all that brilliant or original in the first place.)  Zuckerberg, of course, went on to found Facebook and bring it to incredible success.
 
I tried to use the ConnectU site recently, but got an error when searching for a funny name with an apostrophe,  o’connor .  It turns out this was symptomatic of a very grave security flaw in their code, an  SQL injection vulnerability .  While Facebook recently had  a minor security-related glitch , ConnectU’s flaw is far more serious.  A malicious attacker could use this to easily break in</p><p>5 0.036782477 <a title="72-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-12-26-What_is_experimental_philosophy%3F.html">87 brendan oconnor ai-2007-12-26-What is experimental philosophy?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Experimental philosophy:  
 Suppose the chairman of a company has to decide whether to adopt a new program. It would increase profits and help the environment too. “I don’t care at all about helping the environment,” the chairman says. “I just want to make as much profit as I can. Let’s start the new program.” Would you say that the chairman intended to help the environment? 
 
O.K., same circumstance. Except this time the program would harm the environment. The chairman, who still couldn’t care less about the environment, authorizes the program in order to get those profits. As expected, the bottom line goes up, the environment goes down. Would you say the chairman harmed the environment intentionally?
 
in one survey, only 23 percent of people said that the chairman in the first situation had intentionally helped the environment. When they had to think about the second situation, though, fully 82 percent thought that the chairman had intentionally harmed the environment.

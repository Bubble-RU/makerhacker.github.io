<p>Introduction: A common cognitive science view (H. Simon): Heuristics/biases are useful rules-of-thumb to approximate optimizing behavior given computational constraints.
 
Consider the chess-playing heuristic “try not to lose your queen”.  Since you can’t analyze all possible chess moves, it’s nice to have such a rule-of-thumb to narrow down possible actions to consider.  You can reject out of hand an action that leads to losing your queen.  This heuristic helps to approximate optimal chess-playing behavior given your computational constraints.
 
Similarly, moral rules, tendencies, associations, and ontologies are heuristics to approximate socially optimal behavior. “Lying is bad” is a useful rule-of-thumb that usually gets good results for society. Codifying it as a norm — meaning, there’s 3rd party punishment and/or self-punishment (guilt) when it’s violated, thus the rule should get obeyed — is the implementation of a social-level heuristic that generally gives useful behavior.

<p>Introduction: I think game theory could benefit immensely from better presentation.  Its default presentation is pretty mathematical.  This is good because it treats social interactions in an abstract way, highlighting their essential properties, but is bad because it’s hard to understand, especially at first.
 
However, I think I have a visualization that can sometimes capture the same abstract properties of the mathematics.  Here’s a stab at using it to explain everyone’s favorite game, the prisoner’s dilemma.
 
THE PD: Two players each choose whether to play nice, or be mean — Cooperate or Defect.  Then they simultaneously play their actions, and get payoffs depending on what both played.  If both cooperated, they help each other and do well; if both defect, they do quite poorly.  But if one tries to cooperate and the other defects, then the defector gets a big win, and the cooperator gets a crappy “sucker’s payoff”.
 
The formal PD definition looks like this:

<p>Introduction: This is a fun one: researchers  trained capuchin monkeys to understand tokens as currency  by letting them exchange them for food.  Then they did all sorts of behavioral economics-y tests like finding consistency of preferences revealed in price shocks.  The monkeys even displayed  loss aversion  at rates almost identical to humans!  And along the way they got “prostitution”:
  
Something else happened during that chaotic scene, something that convinced Chen of the monkeysâ€™ true grasp of money. Perhaps the most distinguishing characteristic of money, after all, is its fungibility, the fact that it can be used to buy not just food but anything. During the chaos in the monkey cage, Chen saw something out of the corner of his eye that he would later try to play down but in his heart of hearts he knew to be true. What he witnessed was probably the first observed exchange of money for sex in the history of monkeykind. (Further proof that the monkeys truly understood money: the monkey who</p><p>same-blog 2 0.95202458 <a title="60-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-05-09-Simpson%E2%80%99s_paradox_is_so_totally_solved.html">60 brendan oconnor ai-2007-05-09-Simpson’s paradox is so totally solved</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My friend Lukas just wrote a great formulation of  Simpson’s Paradox as a puzzle :
  

Against left-handed pitchers, Player A has a higher batting average than Player B.  Player A does better against right-handed pitchers also.


Is it possible that B has a better average than A?

  
Here’s a beautiful ASCII art visualization that says Yes.
 
Each star represents a number of at-bats where the player hit; pluses represent misses.  If you put them in a horizontal line you can see the batting averages (proportions) pretty clearly.  The bar lenghts carry across rows — so a longer bar means more at-bats.
  
Against left-handed pitchers:
A hits |**--| A misses    --> 50% avg.
B hits |*---| B misses    --> 25% avg.

Against right-handed pitchers:
A hits |**|              A misses    --> 100% avg.
B hits |**************-| B misses    -->  93% avg.  (for many more at-bats!)

But, batting against *ALL* pitchers:
A hits  |****--| A misses                 --> 66% avg.
B hits  |*********</p><p>3 0.28881121 <a title="60-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2014/brendan_oconnor_ai-2014-02-19-What_the_ACL-2014_review_scores_mean.html">203 brendan oconnor ai-2014-02-19-What the ACL-2014 review scores mean</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve had several people ask me what the numbers in  ACL  reviews mean — and I can’t find anywhere online where they’re described.  (Can anyone point this out if it is somewhere?)
 
So here’s the review form, below.  They all go from 1 to 5, with 5 the best.  I think the review emails to authors only include a subset of the below — for example, “Overall Recommendation” is not included?
 
The CFP said that they have different types of review forms for different types of papers.  I think this one is for a standard full paper.  I guess what people  really  want to know is what scores tend to correspond to acceptances.  I really have no idea and I get the impression this can change year to year.  I have no involvement with the ACL conference besides being one of many, many reviewers.
 
  
  
APPROPRIATENESS (1-5)
Does the paper fit in ACL 2014? (Please answer this question in light of the desire to broaden the scope of the research areas represented at ACL.) 

5: Certainly.

<p>Introduction: This is a good idea: in a search engine’s query logs, look for outbreaks of queries like [[flu symptoms]] in a given region.  I’ve heard (from  Roddy ) that this trick also works well on Facebook statuses (e.g. “Feeling crappy this morning, think I just got the flu”).
  
  Google Uses Web Searches to Track Flu’s Spread – NYTimes.com  
  Google Flu Trends – google.org  
  
For an example with a publicly available data feed, these queries works decently well on Twitter search:
 
 [[ flu -shot -google ]]  (high recall)
 
 [[ "muscle aches" flu -shot ]]  (high precision)
     
 
The “muscle aches” query is too sparse and the general query is too noisy, but you could imagine some more tricks to clean it up, then train a classifier, etc.  With a bit more work it looks like geolocation information can be had out of the  Twitter search API .</p><p>5 0.28268942 <a title="60-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-06-10-Freak-Freakonomics_%28Ariel_Rubinstein_is_the_shit%21%29.html">63 brendan oconnor ai-2007-06-10-Freak-Freakonomics (Ariel Rubinstein is the shit!)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I don’t care how lame anyone thinks this is, but economic theorist  Ariel Rubinstein  is the shit.  He’s funny, self-deprecating, and brilliant.  I was just re-reading  his delightful, sarcastic review of Freakonomics .  (Overly dramatized visual depiction below; hey, conflict sells.)
 
    The review consists of excerpts from his own upcoming super-worldwide-bestseller, “Freak-Freakonomics”.  It is full of golden quotes such as: 
  Chapter 2: Why do economists earn more than mathematicians?  
 
…
 
The comparison between architects and prostitutes can be applied to mathematicians and economists: The former are more skilled, highly educated and intelligent.  
 
To elaborate: 
 Levitt has never encountered a girl who dreams of being a prostitute and I have never met a child who dreams of being an economist. Like prostitutes, the skill required of economists is “not necessarily ‘specialized’” (106). And, finally, here is a new explanation for the salary gap between mathematicians and eco</p><p>6 0.28219926 <a title="60-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-09-02-cognitive_modelling_is_rational_choice%2B%2B.html">26 brendan oconnor ai-2005-09-02-cognitive modelling is rational choice++</a></p>

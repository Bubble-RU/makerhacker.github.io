<p>Introduction: An two-step explanation for distrust of science: (1) journalists write up poor science or take out the evidence and information from a scientific study, then (2) people read that and criticize science for being unfounded, arbitrary, etc.   Link .  Some fun quotes:   
 Statistics are what causes the most fear for reporters, and so they are usually just edited out, with interesting consequences. Because science isn’t about something being true or not true: that’s a humanities graduate parody. It’s about the error bar, statistical significance, it’s about how reliable and valid the experiment was, it’s about coming to a verdict, about a hypothesis, on the back of lots of bits of evidence.  
 
 and   
 
  So how do the media work around their inability to deliver scientific evidence? They use authority figures, the very antithesis of what science is about, as if they were priests, or politicians, or parent figures. “Scientists today said … scientists revealed … scientists warned.” And if t</p><p>4 0.085885659 <a title="85-tfidf-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-11-15-Actually_that_2008_elections_voter_fMRI_study_is_batshit_insane_%28and_sleazy_too%29.html">83 brendan oconnor ai-2007-11-15-Actually that 2008 elections voter fMRI study is batshit insane (and sleazy too)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A much more slashing commentary from Slate:  
 An op-ed from Sunday’s New York Times, “This Is Your Brain on Politics,” proposes to answer what must be the most vexing question of modern American politics: What’s going on inside the head of a swing voter? The authorsâ€”a team of neuroscientists and political consultantsâ€”ran 20 of these undecided volunteers through a brain scanner and showed them pictures and video of the major candidates from both parties. The results, laid out both in print and an online slide show, purport to give us some insight as to how the upcoming primaries will play out: “Mitt Romney may have some potential,” the researchers conclude, and Hillary Clinton seems to have an edge at winning over her opponents. 
 
Don’t believe a word of it. To liken these neurological pundits to snake-oil salesmen would be far too generous. Their imaging study has not been published in any science journal, nor has it been vetted by experts in the field; it can’t rightly be called</p><p>5 0.078218482 <a title="85-tfidf-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2012/brendan_oconnor_ai-2012-07-17-p-values%2C_CDF%E2%80%99s%2C_NLP_etc..html">185 brendan oconnor ai-2012-07-17-p-values, CDF’s, NLP etc.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update Aug 10: THIS IS NOT A SUMMARY OF THE WHOLE PAPER!  it’s whining about one particular method of analysis before talking about other things further down
   
A quick note on  Berg-Kirkpatrick et al EMNLP-2012, “An Empirical Investigation of Statistical Signiﬁcance in NLP” .  They make lots of graphs of p-values against observed magnitudes and talk about “curves”, e.g.
 
 We see the same curve-shaped trend we saw for summarization and dependency parsing. Different group comparisons, same group comparisons, and system combination comparisons form distinct curves. 
 
For example, Figure 2.
 
   
 
I fear they made 10 graphs to rediscover a basic statistical fact: a p-value comes from a null hypothesis CDF.  That’s what these “curve-shaped trends” are in all their graphs.  They are CDFs.
 
To back up, the statistical significance testing question is whether, in their notation, the observed dataset performance difference \(\delta(x)\) is “real” or not: if you were to resample the data,</p><p>6 0.076658174 <a title="85-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-06-11-Richard_Rorty_has_died.html">64 brendan oconnor ai-2007-06-11-Richard Rorty has died</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Richard Rorty, philosopher, dies at 75 .
 
I’ve read enough of the analytic philosophers castigating Rorty — and taken bits of classes from a few of them — that I feel I just have to love the man.
 
I remember managing to see him speak twice.  Once was on philosophy of mind at the good ol’ Sym Sys Forum.   (Video!)   (“He is wrong, but wrong in such an interesting way!” I remember one comment.)
 
Most fascinating was when he gamely participated in a discussion at this very odd Christian thought conference some groups on campus put together.  (The Veritas Forum,  here’s a link .)  He was standing there, arguing with the Christian conservatives about the nature and legitimacy of authority, but humorously ceding ground where appropriate… “Look, it’s not that all children will be active critical thinkers and discover everything for themselves.  Getting a kid a secular liberal education isn’t that much different than any other education — you have to beat it in to them.”  (That is a paraphr</p><p>4 0.51561952 <a title="85-lsi-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-08-05-Are_ideas_interesting%2C_or_are_they_true%3F.html">73 brendan oconnor ai-2007-08-05-Are ideas interesting, or are they true?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From an  NYT Magazine  article this Sunday, paraphrasing  Isaiah Berlin :
  
 The philosopher Isaiah Berlin once said that the trouble with academics and commentators is that they care more about whether ideas are interesting than whether they are true. Politicians live by ideas just as much as professional thinkers do, but they can’t afford the luxury of entertaining ideas that are merely interesting. They have to work with the small number of ideas that happen to be true and the even smaller number that happen to be applicable to real life. In academic life, false ideas are merely false and useless ones can be fun to play with. In political life, false ideas can ruin the lives of millions and useless ones can waste precious resources. An intellectual’s responsibility for his ideas is to follow their consequences wherever they may lead. A politician’s responsibility is to master those consequences and prevent them from doing harm.
  
I can’t speak for that level of politics, but I’ve</p><p>5 0.49188352 <a title="85-lsi-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-11-20-science_writing_bad%21.html">28 brendan oconnor ai-2005-11-20-science writing bad!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: William Saletan, a writer for Slate, recently wrote  a loud series of articles  on genetic racial differences in IQ in the wake of James Watson’s  controversial remarks .  It prompted lots of discussion; here is an  excellent response from Richard Nisbett , a leading authority in the field on the environmentalist side of the debate.
 
More academic articles:  Rushton and Jensen’s 2005 review  of evidence for genetic differences; and what I’ve found to be the most balanced so far, the 1995 APA report  Inteligence: Knowns and Unknowns  which concludes for all the heated claims out there, the scientific evidence tends to be pretty weak.
 
Blog world:  Funny title from Brad DeLong ; and another  Slate response to Saletan and Rushton/Jensen .
 
The politics of the race and intelligence question is a huge distraction from trying to find out the actual truth of the matter.  But I suppose the political implications are why it attracts so much attention — for good or bad.

<p>Introduction: I was just looking at some papers from the  SANCL-2012 workshop on web parsing  from June this year, which are very interesting to those of us who wish we had good parsers for non-newspaper text.  The shared task focus was on domain adaptation from a setting of lots of Wall Street Journal annotated data and very little in-domain training data.  (Previous discussion  here ; see Ryan McDonald’s detailed comment.)   Here are some graphs of the results ( last page in the Petrov & McDonald overview ).
 
I was most interested in whether parsing accuracy on the WSJ correlates to accuracy on web text.  Fortunately, it does.  They evaluated all systems on four evaluation sets: (1) Text from a question/answer site, (2) newsgroups, (3) reviews, and (4) Wall Street Journal PTB.  Here is a graph across system entries, with the x-axis being the labeled dependency parsing accuracy on WSJPTB, and the y-axis the average accuracy on the three web evaluation sets.  Note the axis scales are different: web</p><p>3 0.27507949 <a title="85-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2012/brendan_oconnor_ai-2012-07-17-p-values%2C_CDF%E2%80%99s%2C_NLP_etc..html">185 brendan oconnor ai-2012-07-17-p-values, CDF’s, NLP etc.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update Aug 10: THIS IS NOT A SUMMARY OF THE WHOLE PAPER!  it’s whining about one particular method of analysis before talking about other things further down
   
A quick note on  Berg-Kirkpatrick et al EMNLP-2012, “An Empirical Investigation of Statistical Signiﬁcance in NLP” .  They make lots of graphs of p-values against observed magnitudes and talk about “curves”, e.g.
 
 We see the same curve-shaped trend we saw for summarization and dependency parsing. Different group comparisons, same group comparisons, and system combination comparisons form distinct curves. 
 
For example, Figure 2.
 
   
 
I fear they made 10 graphs to rediscover a basic statistical fact: a p-value comes from a null hypothesis CDF.  That’s what these “curve-shaped trends” are in all their graphs.  They are CDFs.
 
To back up, the statistical significance testing question is whether, in their notation, the observed dataset performance difference \(\delta(x)\) is “real” or not: if you were to resample the data,</p><p>4 0.25365749 <a title="85-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2012/brendan_oconnor_ai-2012-10-02-Powerset%E2%80%99s_natural_language_search_system.html">188 brendan oconnor ai-2012-10-02-Powerset’s natural language search system</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There’s a lot to say about  Powerset , the short-lived natural language search company (2005-2008) where I worked after college.  AI overhype, flying too close to the sun, the psychology of tech journalism and venture capitalism, etc.  A year or two ago I wrote the following bit about Powerset’s technology in response to a question  on Quora .  I’m posting a revised version here.
 
 Question:  What was Powerset’s core innovation in search?  As far as I can tell, they licensed an NLP engine. They did not have a question answering system or any system for information extraction. How was Powerset’s search engine different than Google’s?
 
 My answer:  Powerset built a system vaguely like a question-answering system on top of Xerox PARC’s NLP engine.  The output is better described as query-focused summarization rather than question answering; primarily, it matched semantic fragments of the user query against indexed semantic relations, with lots of keyword/ngram-matching fallback for when</p><p>5 0.2383076 <a title="85-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2013/brendan_oconnor_ai-2013-08-20-Some_analysis_of_tweet_shares_and_%E2%80%9Cpredicting%E2%80%9D_election_outcomes.html">198 brendan oconnor ai-2013-08-20-Some analysis of tweet shares and “predicting” election outcomes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Everyone recently seems to be talking about  this newish paper by Digrazia, McKelvey, Bollen, and Rojas  ( pdf here ) that examines the correlation of Congressional candidate name mentions on Twitter against whether the candidate won the race.  One of the coauthors also wrote a Washington Post  Op-Ed  about it.  I read the paper and I think it’s reasonable, but their op-ed overstates their results.  It claims:
  
“In the 2010 data, our Twitter data predicted the winner in 404 out of 435 competitive races”
  
But this analysis is nowhere in their paper.  Fabio Rojas has now  posted errata/rebuttals  about the op-ed and described this analysis they did here.  There are several major issues off the bat:
  
 They didn’t ever predict 404/435 races; they only analyzed 406 races they call “competitive,” getting 92.5% (in-sample) accuracy, then extrapolated to all races to get the 435 number. 
 They’re reporting about  in-sample  predictions, which is really misleading to a non-scientific audi</p><p>6 0.2380749 <a title="85-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2006/brendan_oconnor_ai-2006-08-30-A_big%2C_fun_list_of_links_I%E2%80%99m_reading.html">44 brendan oconnor ai-2006-08-30-A big, fun list of links I’m reading</a></p>

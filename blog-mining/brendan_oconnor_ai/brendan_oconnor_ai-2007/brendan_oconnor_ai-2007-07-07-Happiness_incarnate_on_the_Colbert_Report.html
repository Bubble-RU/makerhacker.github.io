<p>Introduction: I love this  Daily Show clip with Alan Greenspan .  On emotion and economic forecasting.  From 2007.
 
   
  
GREENSPAN: 
I’ve been dealing with these big mathematical models of forecasting the economy, and I’m looking at what’s going on in the last few weeks. … If I could figure out a way to determine whether or not people are more fearful or changing to more euphoric … I don’t need any of this other stuff.  I could forecast the economy better than any way I know.


The trouble is that we can’t figure that out. I’ve been in the forecasting business for 50 years. … I’m no better than I ever was, and nobody else is. Forecasting 50 years ago was as good or as bad as it is today. And the reason is that human nature hasn’t changed. We can’t improve ourselves.”

<p>Introduction: Freud Is Widely Taught at Universities, Except in the Psychology Department :
  
PSYCHOANALYSIS and its ideas about the unconscious mind have spread to every nook and cranny of the culture from Salinger to “South Park,” from Fellini to foreign policy. Yet if you want to learn about psychoanalysis at the nation’s top universities, one of the last places to look may be the psychology department.


A new report by the American Psychoanalytic Association has found that while psychoanalysis — or what purports to be psychoanalysis — is alive and well in literature, film, history and just about every other subject in the humanities, psychology departments and textbooks treat it as “desiccated and dead,” a historical artifact instead of “an ongoing movement and a living, evolving process.”
  
I’ve been wondering about this for a while, ever since I heard someone describe Freud as “one of the greatest humanists who ever lived.”  I’m pretty sure he didn’t think of himself that way.

It’s about why people are bad at predicting (and remembering) their happiness levels.  (Pop science psychology, not pop psychology… something like that.)  I liked a bit of it mainly because it has an entertaining overview of some cognitive psychology.  A few very interesting happiness experiments get presented, but if your friend tells you about them before you read the book, it’s all over.
 
Perhaps more amusing is stumbling on Gilbert’s quite entertaining appearance on the Colbert Report last week:</p><p>2 0.95516807 <a title="67-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-07-09-a_bayesian_analysis_of_intelligent_design.html">17 brendan oconnor ai-2005-07-09-a bayesian analysis of intelligent design</a></p>

Pick an organism.  Two propositions, H and E, each may be either true or false about it. 
 H : the organism was designed by an intelligent creator. 
 E : the organism looks like it was designed by an intelligent creator.
 
Most of what I know about ID is from seeing a talk by Michael Behe (may 2005).  He had to major lines of argument:  (1) it is implausible that an evolutionary process could produce life that looks as if it was intelligently designed.  (2) Since it looks like it was intelligently designed, it was.  He really emphasized the E component of the argument.
 
Justifications for E: Lots of organisms look like they were intelligently designed.  They have complex and intricate mechanisms involving coordination among many components.  Sometimes they look like things humans would design: for example, bacteria locomotion devices sometimes bear uncanny resemblance to human-designed motors or propellers.

<p>Introduction: A common cognitive science view (H. Simon): Heuristics/biases are useful rules-of-thumb to approximate optimizing behavior given computational constraints.
 
Consider the chess-playing heuristic “try not to lose your queen”.  Since you can’t analyze all possible chess moves, it’s nice to have such a rule-of-thumb to narrow down possible actions to consider.  You can reject out of hand an action that leads to losing your queen.  This heuristic helps to approximate optimal chess-playing behavior given your computational constraints.
 
Similarly, moral rules, tendencies, associations, and ontologies are heuristics to approximate socially optimal behavior. “Lying is bad” is a useful rule-of-thumb that usually gets good results for society. Codifying it as a norm — meaning, there’s 3rd party punishment and/or self-punishment (guilt) when it’s violated, thus the rule should get obeyed — is the implementation of a social-level heuristic that generally gives useful behavior.

<p>Introduction: This is my idea based off of  Bernheim and Rangel’s  model of addict decision-making .  It’s a really neat model; it manages to relax rationality to allow someone to do something they don’t want to do because they’re addicted to it.  [Rationality assumes a nice well-ordered set of preferences; this model hypothesizes as distinction between emotional "liking" and cognitive, forward "wanting" that can conflict.]  The model is mathematically tractable, it can be used for public welfare analysis, and to top it off — it’s got neuroscientific grounding!
 
It appears to me there are two big criticisms of the economics discipline’s assumptions.  One of course is rationality.  The second has to do with the perfect structure of the market and environment that shapes both preferences and the ability to exercise them.  One critique is about social structure: consumers are not atomistic individual units, but rather exchange information and ideas along networks of patterned social relations.

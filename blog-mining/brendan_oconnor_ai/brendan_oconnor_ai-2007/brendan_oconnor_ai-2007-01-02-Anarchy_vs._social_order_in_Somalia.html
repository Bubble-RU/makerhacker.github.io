<p>Introduction: An two-step explanation for distrust of science: (1) journalists write up poor science or take out the evidence and information from a scientific study, then (2) people read that and criticize science for being unfounded, arbitrary, etc.   Link .  Some fun quotes:   
 Statistics are what causes the most fear for reporters, and so they are usually just edited out, with interesting consequences. Because science isn’t about something being true or not true: that’s a humanities graduate parody. It’s about the error bar, statistical significance, it’s about how reliable and valid the experiment was, it’s about coming to a verdict, about a hypothesis, on the back of lots of bits of evidence.  
 
 and   
 
  So how do the media work around their inability to deliver scientific evidence? They use authority figures, the very antithesis of what science is about, as if they were priests, or politicians, or parent figures. “Scientists today said … scientists revealed … scientists warned.” And if t</p><p>3 0.067921504 <a title="46-tfidf-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-06-04-June_4.html">143 brendan oconnor ai-2009-06-04-June 4</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In 1994, the Rwandan genocide claimed 800,000 lives.  This genocide was remarkable for being very low-tech — lots of non-military, average people with machetes killing their neighbors.  Romeo Dallaire, the leader of the small UN peacekeeping mission there, saw it coming and was convinced he could stop much of the violence if he had 5,000 international troops plus the authority to seize weapon caches and do other aggressive intervention operations.  Famously,  he made a plea to his superiors and was denied .  (The genocide ended only when a rebel army managed a string of military victories and forcibly stopped the killing.)

<p>Introduction: At some point, I put extra email addresses on Facebook because I thought it was necessary for something, but didn’t want to show them, so in the privacy settings marked their visibility as “Only Me.”  It turns out that right now, Facebook is blatantly ignoring that privacy setting, and instead showing them to the world.
 
Here are my settings:

I would complain to their customer service, but I can’t find a link from their  Help Center  page.
 
Obviously, this particular issue is a very minor concern for me.  But it hardly instills faith in the system — especially considering that privacy bugs are ones that the affected user, almost by definition, can’t see.  I’ve also had other weird issues where changes to privacy settings don’t seem to stick when I save then later go back to the page.

<p>Introduction: Will Fitzgerald just wrote about  an excellent  article by Steven Strogatz  on Zipf’s Law for the populations of cities.  If you look at the biggest city, then the next biggest city, etc., there tends to be an exponential fall-off in size.
 
I was wondering what this looks like so here’s the classic zipfian plot (log-size vs. log-rank) for city population data from from  populationdata.net :
 
   
 
If you fit a power law — that is, a line on the above logsize-logrank plot — you can use rank to predict the sizes of smaller cities very accurately, according to Will’s analysis.  Larger cities are more problematic, lying off the line.
 
I was curious whether the power law holds  within  countries as well.  The above plot was only for the countries that had more than 10 cities in the dataset — just eight countries.  So here are those same cities again, but plotted against ranks within their respective countries.
 
   
 
The answer is — usually, yes, the power law looks like it holds within</p><p>5 0.36991593 <a title="46-lsi-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-06-29-Evangelicals_vs._Aquarians.html">66 brendan oconnor ai-2007-06-29-Evangelicals vs. Aquarians</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Just read an interesting analysis on the the simultaneous rise of the cultural left and right (“hippies and evangelicals”) through the 50′s and 60′s.   Brink Lindsey argues here  that they were both reactions to post-war material prosperity:
  
On the left gathered those who were most alive to the new possibilities created by the unprecedented mass affluence of the postwar years but at the same time were hostile to the social institutions — namely, the market and the middle-class work ethic — that created those possibilities. On the right rallied those who staunchly supported the institutions that created prosperity but who shrank from the social dynamism they were unleashing. One side denounced capitalism but gobbled its fruits; the other cursed the fruits while defending the system that bore them. Both causes were quixotic, and consequently neither fully realized its ambitions.
  
I love  neat sweeping theories of history ; I can’t take it overly seriously but it is so fun.

<p>Introduction: In light of the Somali transitional government’s recent military triumph over Islamist forces, the BBC did a piece of  very interesting testimonials from everyday Somalis  — they all want a government for peace and order in their lives.  Anarchy is extremely unpopular.   (more info on this.)   A musician complains that since nightclubs are shut down, his only work is at occasional weddings, and adds: 
 The wedding parties are big, spectacular affairs, you wouldn’t think they were in a country without a government. 
 
But it’s only the people who are members of the big armed clans who can have these parties.
 
Other people get married but they cannot have big parties in case they are attacked and robbed. They just get married in secret.
 
I’ve been re-reading Hobbes and this sounds familiar — the enjoyment of all sorts of goods requires a strong organization protecting you, to deter would-be thieves.  That’s what a good government does.
 
The musician concludes:

<p>Introduction: Here’s a little interactive explorer for the  beta probability distribution , a conjugate prior for the Bernoulli under  Bayesian inference …
 
Ack, too much jargon.  Simply press the right arrow  every time you see the sun rise, the up arrow when it doesn’t, and opposite directions for amnesia. 
 
  
 
I’ve wanted this for a while, an interface that lets you directly control a learning process / play with parameters, and see the effect on posterior beliefs, because I have a poor intuition for all these probability distributions.  However, it was never worth actually making this until I tried out using  Processing , an amazingly easy-to-use visualization development tool.  This is my first Processing app and it was extremely easy to develop — easier than any other graphic/GUI framework I can think of.

<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: update 2012-10-25 : I’ve been informed there is a new maintainer for Mawk, who has probably fixed the bugs I’ve been seeing.
  

From: Gert Hulselmans   


[The bugs you have found are] indeed true with mawk v1.3.3 which comes standard with Debian/Ubuntu.  This version is almost not developed the last 10 years.


I now already use mawk v1.3.4 maintained by another developer (Thomas E. Dickey) 
for more than a year on huge datafiles (sometimes several GB).


The problems/wrong results I had with mawk v1.3.3 sometimes are gone. In his version, normally all open/known bugs are fixed.


This version can be downloaded from:  http://invisible-island.net/mawk/ 

     update 2010-04-30  : I have since found large datasets where mawk is buggy and gives the wrong result.  nawk seems safe.   When one of these newfangled   “Big Data”   sets comes your way, the very first thing you have to do is data munging: shuffling around file formats, renaming fields and the like.

<p>Introduction: Everyone recently seems to be talking about  this newish paper by Digrazia, McKelvey, Bollen, and Rojas  ( pdf here ) that examines the correlation of Congressional candidate name mentions on Twitter against whether the candidate won the race.  One of the coauthors also wrote a Washington Post  Op-Ed  about it.  I read the paper and I think it’s reasonable, but their op-ed overstates their results.  It claims:
  
“In the 2010 data, our Twitter data predicted the winner in 404 out of 435 competitive races”
  
But this analysis is nowhere in their paper.  Fabio Rojas has now  posted errata/rebuttals  about the op-ed and described this analysis they did here.  There are several major issues off the bat:
  
 They didn’t ever predict 404/435 races; they only analyzed 406 races they call “competitive,” getting 92.5% (in-sample) accuracy, then extrapolated to all races to get the 435 number. 
 They’re reporting about  in-sample  predictions, which is really misleading to a non-scientific audi</p><p>6 0.19444254 <a title="46-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2011/brendan_oconnor_ai-2011-10-05-Be_careful_with_dictionary-based_text_analysis.html">176 brendan oconnor ai-2011-10-05-Be careful with dictionary-based text analysis</a></p>

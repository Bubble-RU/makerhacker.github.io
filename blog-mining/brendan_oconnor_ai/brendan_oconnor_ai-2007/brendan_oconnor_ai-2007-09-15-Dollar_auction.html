The professor offers a dollar for sale to the highest bidder, with only one wrinkle: the second-highest bidder has to pay up on their losing bid as well. Several students almost always get sucked in. The first bids a penny, looking to make 99 cents. The second bids 2 cents, the third 3 cents, and so on, each feeling they have a chance at something good on the cheap.

<p>Introduction: Rational choice has been a huge imperialistic success, growing in popularity and being applied to more and more fields.  Why is this?  It’s not because the rational choice model of decision-making is particularly realistic.  Rather, it’s because rational choice is a  completely specified theory of human behavior , and therefore is great at generating hypotheses.  Given any situation involving people, rational choice can be used to generate a hypothesis about what to expect.  That is, you just ask, “What would a person do to maximize their own benefit?”
 
Similar things have been said about evolutionary psychology: you can always predict behavior by asking “what would hunter-gatherers do?”  Now, certainly both rational choice and evolutionary psychology don’t always generate  correct  hypotheses, but they’re incredibly useful because they at least give you a starting point.

<p>Introduction: I think game theory could benefit immensely from better presentation.  Its default presentation is pretty mathematical.  This is good because it treats social interactions in an abstract way, highlighting their essential properties, but is bad because it’s hard to understand, especially at first.
 
However, I think I have a visualization that can sometimes capture the same abstract properties of the mathematics.  Here’s a stab at using it to explain everyone’s favorite game, the prisoner’s dilemma.
 
THE PD: Two players each choose whether to play nice, or be mean — Cooperate or Defect.  Then they simultaneously play their actions, and get payoffs depending on what both played.  If both cooperated, they help each other and do well; if both defect, they do quite poorly.  But if one tries to cooperate and the other defects, then the defector gets a big win, and the cooperator gets a crappy “sucker’s payoff”.

<p>Introduction: [Like medieval Christian societies,] Islamic societies similarly found ingenious ways to circumvent the usury ban.  The primary one was the  double sale .  In this transaction, the borrower would get, for example, both 100 dinars cash and a small piece of cloth valued at the absurdly high price of 15 dinars.  In a year he would have to pay back 100 dinars for the loan of the cash and 15 for the cloth.  These debts were upheld by Sharia courts.
  
The cognition of rules and ethics sure is complex.  I’d love to read the reasoning from those courts.
 
From from Gregory Clark’s  rather intense review  of  Avner Greif ‘s new-ish book on institutional economics.  (Clark’s the one who wrote that  interesting but weird  evolutionary argument about European economic development.)  If you’re in to the little worlds of institutional, evolutionary, and behavioral economics, Greif’s work is really interesting.

<p>Introduction: Rock, Paper, Scissors is making the blog rounds with an excellent strategy guide  from the World RPS Society  and a fun  mental floss article  too.  (Though the  First International RoShamBo programming contest  should be noted.)  Having played far too much RPS last year, I can say these tips look pretty decent for the most part.  I will say I am a huge fan of the elegant move Running With Scissors — scissors three times in a row.  “You think I’m crazy enough to play that AGAIN?”  Un-frickin-stoppable.
 
Everyone thinks, “but wait, RPS is a lame game.  Playing randomly is the best strategy!”  This is not true.  Playing randomly is the best defensive strategy, since your opponent can never do better than 50% against it.  However, it is not the best offensive strategy if you can infer what your opponent will play.  For example, if you are confident that your opponent is too scared to play scissors for a third time in a row, exploit that and play paper (the only move vulnerable to scissor</p><p>6 0.062891953 <a title="77-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-01-31-Food_Fight.html">92 brendan oconnor ai-2008-01-31-Food Fight</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A common cognitive science view (H. Simon): Heuristics/biases are useful rules-of-thumb to approximate optimizing behavior given computational constraints.
 
Consider the chess-playing heuristic “try not to lose your queen”.  Since you can’t analyze all possible chess moves, it’s nice to have such a rule-of-thumb to narrow down possible actions to consider.  You can reject out of hand an action that leads to losing your queen.  This heuristic helps to approximate optimal chess-playing behavior given your computational constraints.
 
Similarly, moral rules, tendencies, associations, and ontologies are heuristics to approximate socially optimal behavior. “Lying is bad” is a useful rule-of-thumb that usually gets good results for society. Codifying it as a norm — meaning, there’s 3rd party punishment and/or self-punishment (guilt) when it’s violated, thus the rule should get obeyed — is the implementation of a social-level heuristic that generally gives useful behavior.

<p>Introduction: Since I posted the link to his blog, Baron just  wrote about   Cardinal Schönborn’s anti-evolution Op-Ed piece .  I agree absolutely that people should learn about the psychology of judgment and probability for these sorts of questions, where it’s really hard to understand that random processes can generate things that seem not so random.
 
I’m still thinking about how the psychology of judgment plays in to  the analysis below .  I have a feeling that people’s intuitions are usually too hospitable for explanations based on intention.  E.g.: People are poor, therefore someone is trying to make them poor.  Organizations (corportations, governments) do things, therefore someone (say, at the top) ordered them to do these things.  Natural disasters happen, therefore someone is wishing them upon us.  Etc., etc.  I’m still not sure how a bayesian dissection of whether “looks intentful” implies “is intentful” shows us whether such an “intent-seeking” bias (hey, I have to call it something) is</p><p>same-blog 3 0.99765354 <a title="77-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-09-15-Dollar_auction.html">77 brendan oconnor ai-2007-09-15-Dollar auction</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I got nervous and panicky just reading about this game.  I wonder if I could con some people into playing it.
  
Economics professors have a standard game they use to demonstrate how apparently rational decisions can create a disastrous result. They call it a “dollar auction.” The rules are simple. The professor offers a dollar for sale to the highest bidder, with only one wrinkle: the second-highest bidder has to pay up on their losing bid as well. Several students almost always get sucked in. The first bids a penny, looking to make 99 cents. The second bids 2 cents, the third 3 cents, and so on, each feeling they have a chance at something good on the cheap. The early stages are fun, and the bidders wonder what possessed the professor to be willing to lose some money.


The problem surfaces when the bidders get up close to a dollar. After 99 cents the last vestige of profitability disappears, but the bidding continues between the two highest players. They now realize that they stand</p><p>4 0.9962914 <a title="77-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-06-05-Clinton-Obama_support_visualization.html">105 brendan oconnor ai-2008-06-05-Clinton-Obama support visualization</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Rational choice has been a huge imperialistic success, growing in popularity and being applied to more and more fields.  Why is this?  It’s not because the rational choice model of decision-making is particularly realistic.  Rather, it’s because rational choice is a  completely specified theory of human behavior , and therefore is great at generating hypotheses.  Given any situation involving people, rational choice can be used to generate a hypothesis about what to expect.  That is, you just ask, “What would a person do to maximize their own benefit?”
 
Similar things have been said about evolutionary psychology: you can always predict behavior by asking “what would hunter-gatherers do?”  Now, certainly both rational choice and evolutionary psychology don’t always generate  correct  hypotheses, but they’re incredibly useful because they at least give you a starting point.
 
Witness the theory of bounded rationality: just like rational choice, except amended to consider computational l</p><p>6 0.99305701 <a title="77-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-06-10-Freak-Freakonomics_%28Ariel_Rubinstein_is_the_shit%21%29.html">63 brendan oconnor ai-2007-06-10-Freak-Freakonomics (Ariel Rubinstein is the shit!)</a></p>

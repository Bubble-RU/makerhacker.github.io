<p>Introduction: The latest on the world ideologies front –
 
In the light of Russia’s Georgia adventures, there’s been lots of talk whether this represents a new rise of authoritarian Russia, which is presumably another nail in the coffin for U.S.-led liberal democratic hegemony in the world.  Our “end of history” friend Francis Fukuyama just wrote an op-ed arguing that  Russia and China are still not big threats to liberal democracy .  There are some good points: Russia is behaving as an aggressive imperial power, but does not embrace a grand, exportable ideology with universal appeal.  Similarly with China.  They both still feel the need to pay lip service to democratic rituals and norms.  Even Nicholas Kristof’s hilarious column  chronicling his experience with China’s dubious protest registration system  concludes that even a pale mockery of democracy is progress.

<p>Introduction: This is fascinating — In China,  you can get fined if you make a map of China without Taiwan or other disputed territories .  Reminds me of being confused trying to find the primary airline of China.
 
   
 
Based of vague recollections of its name, I searched Google for  {{ china air }} .  The first hit was for  China Airlines .  But the second hit was  Air China .  The first is the state carrier of the ROC (Taiwan), the second is the PRC (mainland China).  Turns out my intended concept, “Official Chinese airline”, isn’t a coherent concept if your political worldview includes both the ROC and PRC as entities.  But maybe what I should have wanted was just airlines that fly around East Asia and various parts of China; in that case, getting both airlines is the right thing to do.  At least Google got them both at the top of the list.

<p>Introduction: Richard Rorty, philosopher, dies at 75 .
 
I’ve read enough of the analytic philosophers castigating Rorty — and taken bits of classes from a few of them — that I feel I just have to love the man.
 
I remember managing to see him speak twice.  Once was on philosophy of mind at the good ol’ Sym Sys Forum.   (Video!)   (“He is wrong, but wrong in such an interesting way!” I remember one comment.)
 
Most fascinating was when he gamely participated in a discussion at this very odd Christian thought conference some groups on campus put together.  (The Veritas Forum,  here’s a link .)  He was standing there, arguing with the Christian conservatives about the nature and legitimacy of authority, but humorously ceding ground where appropriate… “Look, it’s not that all children will be active critical thinkers and discover everything for themselves.  Getting a kid a secular liberal education isn’t that much different than any other education — you have to beat it in to them.”  (That is a paraphr</p><p>5 0.068866685 <a title="81-tfidf-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-01-31-Food_Fight.html">92 brendan oconnor ai-2008-01-31-Food Fight</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Absolutely amazing — a  short film  chronicling conflicts from World War II — as food.
 
  
 
I think this has to have the highest amount of Wikipedia-linkable references per second of any film I’ve seen.  Yes, it’s U.S.-centric, but so is Wikipedia, which makes cataloguing it easier.  At the very least:
 
  World War II 
 
  Persecution of Jews  and  The Holocaust  
  Invasion of France  
  The Blitz  
  Pearl Harbor ,  Pacific Theater  
  D-Day  
  Liberation of France  Invasion of Germany –  Western  and  Eastern  fronts 
  Atomic bombing of Hiroshima  
 
 
  1948 Arab-Israeli War  
  Korean War  
  Cuban Missile Crisis  
  Vietnam War 
 
  French Indochina War  
  U.S. involvement  
 
 
  US/USSR nuclear arms race  
  First Gulf War  
   
  Invasion of Kuwait  
 
   Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
 
 Judging from its timing in the film, maybe specifically the  First Intifada ? 
 
 
  9/11 attacks

<p>Introduction: Sometimes it seems bad countries come with long names.  North Korea is “People’s Democratic Republic of Korea”, Libya is “Great Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya”, and the like.  But on the other hand, there’s plenty of counter-examples — it’s the “United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland” and “Republic of Cuba”, after all.  Do long names with good-sounding adjectives correspond with non-democratic governments?
 
Fortunately, this can be tested.  First, what words are out there?  From the  CIA Factbook’s  data on long form names, here are some of the most popular words used by today’s countries, listed with the number of occurrences across all 194 names.  I limited to tokens that appear >= 3 times.  A majority of countries are Republics, while there are some Kingdoms, and even a few Democracies.

<p>Introduction: Before I forget — a while back I read a terrific Foreign Affairs article,  The Return of Authoritarian Great Powers .  The argument is, just a century or so ago, states based on authoritarian capitalism were very powerful in the world; e.g. imperial Japan and Germany.  They got plenty of the economic benefits of capitalism but not so much the democratic effects people like to talk about today.  (And there are interesting points that the failure of fascism in the second world war was contingent and not inherent to the ideology.)  The author argues this looks like the future: Russia and China are becoming economically strong world powers but keeping solidly non-democratic ways of governance.  The period of liberal democracy we live in, with all its overhyped speculation about the inevitable spread democracy and free market capitalism — say, an  “end of history”  — might just be that, a moment caused by the vagaries of 20th century history.

<p>Introduction: The latest on the world ideologies front –
 
In the light of Russia’s Georgia adventures, there’s been lots of talk whether this represents a new rise of authoritarian Russia, which is presumably another nail in the coffin for U.S.-led liberal democratic hegemony in the world.  Our “end of history” friend Francis Fukuyama just wrote an op-ed arguing that  Russia and China are still not big threats to liberal democracy .  There are some good points: Russia is behaving as an aggressive imperial power, but does not embrace a grand, exportable ideology with universal appeal.  Similarly with China.  They both still feel the need to pay lip service to democratic rituals and norms.  Even Nicholas Kristof’s hilarious column  chronicling his experience with China’s dubious protest registration system  concludes that even a pale mockery of democracy is progress.
 
I still like Azar Gat’s article which I wrote about last year, that  Russia and China represent authoritarian capitalism, which will</p><p>5 0.49536216 <a title="81-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-04-06-a_regression_slope_is_a_weighted_average_of_pairs%E2%80%99_slopes%21.html">100 brendan oconnor ai-2008-04-06-a regression slope is a weighted average of pairs’ slopes!</a></p>

From an  Andrew Gelman article  on summaring a linear regression as a simple difference between upper and lower categories.  I get the impression there are lots of weird misunderstood corners of linear models… (e.g. that “least squares regression” is a maximum likelihood estimator for a linear model with normal noise… I know so many people who didn’t learn that from their stats whatever course, and therefore find it mystifying why squared error should be used…  see this  other post from Gelman .)</p><p>6 0.48906898 <a title="81-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-07-23-R_questions_on_StackOverflow.html">148 brendan oconnor ai-2009-07-23-R questions on StackOverflow</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A much more slashing commentary from Slate:  
 An op-ed from Sunday’s New York Times, “This Is Your Brain on Politics,” proposes to answer what must be the most vexing question of modern American politics: What’s going on inside the head of a swing voter? The authorsâ€”a team of neuroscientists and political consultantsâ€”ran 20 of these undecided volunteers through a brain scanner and showed them pictures and video of the major candidates from both parties. The results, laid out both in print and an online slide show, purport to give us some insight as to how the upcoming primaries will play out: “Mitt Romney may have some potential,” the researchers conclude, and Hillary Clinton seems to have an edge at winning over her opponents. 
 
Don’t believe a word of it. To liken these neurological pundits to snake-oil salesmen would be far too generous. Their imaging study has not been published in any science journal, nor has it been vetted by experts in the field; it can’t rightly be called</p><p>4 0.071931891 <a title="56-tfidf-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-12-26-What_is_experimental_philosophy%3F.html">87 brendan oconnor ai-2007-12-26-What is experimental philosophy?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Experimental philosophy:  
 Suppose the chairman of a company has to decide whether to adopt a new program. It would increase profits and help the environment too. “I don’t care at all about helping the environment,” the chairman says. “I just want to make as much profit as I can. Let’s start the new program.” Would you say that the chairman intended to help the environment? 
 
O.K., same circumstance. Except this time the program would harm the environment. The chairman, who still couldn’t care less about the environment, authorizes the program in order to get those profits. As expected, the bottom line goes up, the environment goes down. Would you say the chairman harmed the environment intentionally?
 
in one survey, only 23 percent of people said that the chairman in the first situation had intentionally helped the environment. When they had to think about the second situation, though, fully 82 percent thought that the chairman had intentionally harmed the environment. There’s plen</p><p>5 0.070248328 <a title="56-tfidf-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-12-20-Data-driven_charity.html">86 brendan oconnor ai-2007-12-20-Data-driven charity</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Some ex-hedge fund analysts recently started a non-profit devoted to evaluating the effectiveness of hundreds of charities, and  apparently have been making waves (NYT) .  A few interesting reports have been posted on their website,  givewell.net  — they make recommendations for which charities where donors’ money is used most efficiently for saving lives or helping the disadvantaged.
 
(Does anyone else have interesting data on charity effectiveness?  I’ve heard that evaluations are the big thing in philanthropy world now, and certainly the Gates Foundation talks a lot about it.)
 
Obviously this sort of evaluation is tricky, but it  has  to be the right approach.  The NYT article makes them sound like they’re a bit arrogant, which is too bad; on the other hand, any one who makes claims to have better empirical information than the established wisdom will always end up in that dynamic.

<p>Introduction: There’s a lot of exciting work in moral psychology right now.  I’ve been telling various poor fools who listen to me to read something from  Jonathan Haidt  or  Joshua Greene , but of course there’s a sea of too many articles and books of varying quality and intended audience.  But just last week Steven Pinker wrote a great NYT magazine article,  “The Moral Instinct,”  which summarizes current research and tries to spell out a few implications.  I recommend it highly, if just for presenting so many awesome examples.  (Yes, this blog has  poked fun  at Pinker before.  But in any case, he is a brilliant expository writer.   The Language Instinct  is still one of my favorite popular science books.)
 
For a while now I’ve been thinking that recruiting subjects online could lend itself to collecting some really interesting behavioral science data.  A few months ago I tried doing this with  Amazon Mechanical Turk , a horribly misnamed web service that actually lets you create web-based tasks</p><p>4 0.59628046 <a title="56-lsi-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-02-15-Pascal%E2%80%99s_Wager.html">50 brendan oconnor ai-2007-02-15-Pascal’s Wager</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Either God is tricky, or maybe probability is.
 
Pascal’s Wager: Say there’s only a small chance God exists.  If you are an atheist but God does actually exist, He will send you to hell for eternity.  This is infinitely bad.  Therefore you should believe in God on the off-chance he does exist, since a small chance of something infinitely bad is worse than the alternative.
 
 Believe in Pascal’s Wager?  Have I got a deal for you!  says if you believe it, you should send Alex Tabarrok money because he will put in a good word to God for you.  Hey, there’s a small chance he has a direct line to God, which yields infinite utility (or avoids hell’s infinite disutility).
 
FWIW, I’m thinking the paradoxes in this sort of arithmetic always happen when you start doing addition/multiplication distribution across those darn infinities.  Like on the third page Tabarrok starts talking about p1*Inf – p2*Inf = (p1-p2)*Inf.  That’s shady shit.

<p>Introduction: I started reading Jeffrey Sachs’ new book  The End of Poverty .  The first 30 pages are excellent, but it starts getting arrogant and annoying quick.  Substantively, I’m uncertain whether a big new development aid push will solve things.
 
Since I enthusiastically bum around course websites I’m not taking (bad habit, will stop real soon now), I was fortunate to run across an excellent debate between Sachs and William Easterly:
 
 Easterly’s view on Africa: The West Can’t Take The Lead  which has some amazing anecdotes about African educators and entrepreneurs.  (Or, I think they’re amazing only because I’m a condescending Westerner?)
 
 Easterly reviews Sachs .  Choice quote: 
 “Success in ending the poverty trap,” Sachs writes, “will be much easier than it appears.” Really? If it’s so easy, why haven’t five decades of effort gotten the job done? Sachs should redirect some of his outrage at the question of why the previous $2.3 trillion didn’t reach the poor so that the next $2.3 trill</p><p>6 0.47739193 <a title="56-lsi-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-12-26-What_is_experimental_philosophy%3F.html">87 brendan oconnor ai-2007-12-26-What is experimental philosophy?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Don’t have time to read much right now, but received word about a neat-looking paper:  Uncomputability: The Problem of Induction Internalized  by Kevin Kelly.
 
Kevin Kelly’s website has an awesome statement that mirrors thoughts I’ve been having for the last few years — the incredible importance of computational constraints applied to reasoning and rationality:
  
Kuhn teaches that a single, deep success suffices to keep a competing paradign on the table.  Not surprisingly, computational learning theory shows its superiority over ideal theories of rationality when we trade in our ideal agents for more realistic, computable agents.  The foundation of the deep success is a strong structural analogy between the halting problem and the problem of inductive generalization, allowing for a unified treatment of both, from the ground up.  One consequence of the approach is that one can often show that computable agents are forced to choose between ideal rationality and finding the right answer</p><p>2 0.94706529 <a title="56-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-05-23-Sub-reddit_for_Systems_Science_and_OR.html">104 brendan oconnor ai-2008-05-23-Sub-reddit for Systems Science and OR</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve been a big fan of Reddit’s  Programing  subsite for a while.  Just this morning I found another sub-reddit:  SYSOR: Systems Science, Operations Research and Everything In Between , and I’m loving it.  Lots of links on data mining, graph software, image recognition, learning theory, etc etc.
 
Not sure if the Operations Research part in the title is so big now — there’s some sort of complicated reorganization of a number of fields including operations research, systems science, computational learning, and more general computer science areas.  I’m a fan of the great historical overview in the Introduction in  Rusell and Norvig’s AI book ; I’m sure it’s slanted in various ways, but what else are overarching narratives for?  :)</p><p>3 0.94273591 <a title="56-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-04-08-Gapminder.org_%E2%80%94_terrific_world_data_visualizations.html">57 brendan oconnor ai-2007-04-08-Gapminder.org — terrific world data visualizations</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I must be too cynical.  I thought I didn’t like  Philip Zimbardo ‘s theatrics, but regardless I really appreciated  this NYT interview  with him on the universal capacity for evil.     (S.P.E. is the  Stanford Prison Experiment , whose pictures here are from that lovely basement hallway, still there behind the 420-40 and 41 lecture rooms.)
 
In particular: 
 Q. What was your reaction when you first saw those photographs from Abu Ghraib? 
 
A. I was shocked. But not surprised. I immediately flashed on similar pictures from the S.P.E. What particularly bothered me was that the Pentagon blamed the whole thing on a “few bad apples.” I knew from our experiment, if you put good apples into a bad situation, you’ll get bad apples.
 
That was why I was willing to be an expert witness for Sgt. Chip Frederick, who was ultimately sentenced to eight years for his role at Abu Ghraib. Frederick was the Army reservist who was put in charge of the night shift at Tier 1A, where detainees were abused.

<p>Introduction: I was planning to write some  WordNet  lookup code tonight.  But instead I’ve learned of too many intersecting things.
 
First, there are a zillion things to do this weekend ( hooray flavorpill ):
 
  Picasso and American Art  exhibit continuing at  SFMOMA .  I saw it very briefly last weekend but want some more.  And Doug claims there’s an interesting photography exhibit there too.
  Reading from  We Don’t Need Another Wave: Dispatches from the Next Generation of Feminists , a fascinating looking book I’ve seen many times in the bookstores around here.  By that I mean at least Modern Times (the neat Mission bookstore) and the Anarchist Collective Bookstore (out on the Haight).  And the reading is at Modern Times,  just down the street  from my house!  Amazing.  Tomorrow at 7:30.
  Since anarchists were just mentioned, fortuitously there also appears: the  Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair  this Saturday and Sunday!  Speakers and books down by Golden Gate Park, oh my.

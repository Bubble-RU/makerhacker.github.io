The results, laid out both in print and an online slide show, purport to give us some insight as to how the upcoming primaries will play out: “Mitt Romney may have some potential,” the researchers conclude, and Hillary Clinton seems to have an edge at winning over her opponents.

 And here’s a better Guardian article on it.

    I suspect this happens anyway today — using computers to help decisionmakers run the economy — but without the cool Star Trek chairs and display screens.  Economists at central banks get data and use computers to analyze it, then eventually the data is used to inform decisions.
 
Though this vision involves more fine-grained data collection and automated analysis.  (And other more Internet-y things like two-way communication between workers and management/government.).  I suspect it would be way easier to do today, with better computational infrastructure (CPU, memory, data transmission, and software are better these days).</p><p>6 0.072298408 <a title="78-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2006/brendan_oconnor_ai-2006-07-20-neuroscience_and_economics_both_ways.html">41 brendan oconnor ai-2006-07-20-neuroscience and economics both ways</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I previously  posted  two neuroeconomics reviews.   Here’s a new one from this year  in Trends in Cognitive Sciences.  It’s interesting because not only does it look at using psychological knowledge to inform economics, but it also reviews work in the other direction: using economic decision and organizational theory to study brain systems.  For example,   here’s a paper  that analyzes brain reward circuitry using labor supply theory.

<p>Introduction: There’s a company,  Emotiv , that’s building an  EEG  interface for the game systems.  Any company with a  science-fiction-y vision statement  sounds like a good time to me:
  
Communication between man and machine has always been limited to conscious interaction, with non-conscious communication — expression, intuition, perception — reserved solely for the human realm. At Emotiv, we believe that future communication between man and machine will not only be limited to the conscious communication that exists today, but non-conscious communication will play a significant part.


Our mission is to create the ultimate interface for the next-generation of man-machine interaction, by evolving the interaction between human beings and electronic devices beyond the limits of conscious interface. Emotiv is creating technologies that allow machines to take both conscious and non-conscious inputs directly from your mind.
  
They even have a cyborg-looking woman on the page.

<p>Introduction: Seeing a long, lavish article about R in the NEW YORK TIMES (!) really freaks me out. 
  replicate(100,  c(
  "OMG OMG,  R  is now famous?!",
  "People used to make fun of me for learning R since Splus is SO OLD!",
  "I still hear stories that SAS can do crazy tricks that make me jealous.
  But not enough to attempt learning it."

This blog has been a long-time supporter of this both brilliant and insanely quirky statistical programming environment.  Here are some graphs I’ve made in the last year or two that have R code attached:
  
  Wisdom of small crowds  
  Simpson’s paradox via mosaic plots  
  Dolores Labs color wheel!  ( code ) 
  Political bias SVD evaluation  
  Presidential poll aggregation  
 OK, we didn’t post the code, but check out our  N-body trolley graph ! 
  
Learning R is hard because there’s a zillion packages, and the official documentation is reference-oriented.  I’ve never looked at any of the books much.  I think you ca</p><p>3 0.78771025 <a title="78-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-09-26-Seeing_how_%E2%80%9Cart%E2%80%9D_and_%E2%80%9Cpharmaceuticals%E2%80%9D_are_linguistically_similar_in_web_text.html">156 brendan oconnor ai-2009-09-26-Seeing how “art” and “pharmaceuticals” are linguistically similar in web text</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Earlier this week I asked the question,
 
 How are “art” and “pharmaceuticals” similar? 
 
People sent me lots of submissions!  Some are great, some are a bit of a stretch.
  
 Overpriced by an order of magnitude.
  The letters of “art” are found embedded, in order, in “pharmaceuticals”.
  Search keywords that cost the most to advertise on?
  “Wyeth”: I think this means  this , and  this .
  “Romeo and Juliet” famously includes both “art” (wherefore art thou) and pharmaceuticals (poison!)
  Some art has been created out of pharmaceuticals.
  Some art has been created under the influence of pharmaceuticals.
   
I was asking because I was playing around with a dataset of 100,000 noun phrases’ appearances on the web, from the  Reading the Web  project at CMU.  That is, for a noun like “art”, this data has a large list of phrases in which the word “art” is used, across some 200 million web pages.  For two noun concepts, we can see what they have in common and what’s different by looking at</p><p>4 0.28604618 <a title="78-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2004/brendan_oconnor_ai-2004-11-24-addiction_%26_2_problems_of_economics.html">2 brendan oconnor ai-2004-11-24-addiction & 2 problems of economics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is my idea based off of  Bernheim and Rangel’s  model of addict decision-making .  It’s a really neat model; it manages to relax rationality to allow someone to do something they don’t want to do because they’re addicted to it.  [Rationality assumes a nice well-ordered set of preferences; this model hypothesizes as distinction between emotional "liking" and cognitive, forward "wanting" that can conflict.]  The model is mathematically tractable, it can be used for public welfare analysis, and to top it off — it’s got neuroscientific grounding!
 
It appears to me there are two big criticisms of the economics discipline’s assumptions.  One of course is rationality.  The second has to do with the perfect structure of the market and environment that shapes both preferences and the ability to exercise them.  One critique is about social structure: consumers are not atomistic individual units, but rather exchange information and ideas along networks of patterned social relations.

<p>Introduction: There was an  interesting ICML paper  this year about very large-scale training of deep belief networks (a.k.a. neural networks) for unsupervised concept extraction from images.  They ( Quoc V. Le  and colleagues at Google/Stanford) have a cute example of learning very high-level features that are evoked by images of cats (from YouTube still-image training data); one is shown below.
 
For those of us who work on machine learning and text, the question always comes up, why not DBN’s for language?  Many shallow latent-space text models have been quite successful (LSI, LDA, HMM, LPCFG…); there is hope that some sort of “deeper” concepts could be learned.  I think this is one of the most interesting areas for unsupervised language modeling right now.
 
But note it’s a bad idea to directly analogize results from image analysis to language analysis.  The problems have radically different levels of conceptual abstraction baked-in.  Consider the problem of detecting the concept of a cat; i.e.</p><p>6 0.24254325 <a title="78-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2011/brendan_oconnor_ai-2011-10-05-Be_careful_with_dictionary-based_text_analysis.html">176 brendan oconnor ai-2011-10-05-Be careful with dictionary-based text analysis</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It’s been a good year.  Last fall I started a master’s program in the Language Technologies department at  CMU SCS , taking some great classes, hanging out with a  cool lab , and writing two new papers (for  ICWSM , involving Twitter:  polls  and  tweetmotif ; also did some  coref  work, financial text regression stuff, and looked at  social lexicography .)  I also applied to CS and stats PhD programs at several universities.  Next year I’ll be starting the PhD program in the  Machine Learning Department  here at CMU.
 
I’m excited!  Just the other day I was looking at videos on my old hard drive and found a presentation by  Tom Mitchell  on “the Discipline of Machine Learning” that I downloaded back in 2007 or so.  (Can’t find it online right now, but  this is similar .)  That might be where I heard of the department first.  Maybe some day I will be smarter than the guy who wrote  this rant  (though I am much more pro-stats and anti-ML these days…).

<p>Introduction: Great anti-pop-science article of the moment —  Mark Liberman does a take-down  of David Brooks’ apparently  careless column  on cultural psych experiments that purport to show that East Asians are collectivist while Westerns are individualist.
 
From Liberman: 
  Question to Language Log:  Is it correct that if you show an American an image of a fish tank, the American will usually describe the biggest fish in the tank and what it is doing, while if you ask a Chinese person to describe a fish tank, the Chinese will usually describe the context in which the fish swim? 
 
 Answer:  In principle, yes. But first of all, it wasn’t a representative sample of Americans, it was undergraduates in a psychology course at the University of Michigan; and second, it wasn’t Chinese, it was undergraduates in a psychology course at Kyoto University in Japan; and third, it wasn’t a fish tank, it was 10 20-second animated vignettes of underwater scenes; and fourth, the Americans didn’t mention the “foca</p><p>4 0.082330406 <a title="76-tfidf-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-05-29-%22Stanford_Impostor%22.html">62 brendan oconnor ai-2007-05-29-"Stanford Impostor"</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve gotten a zillion emails about it by now, but it was recently found that a young woman had been living for a year in Stanford dorms claiming to be a freshman, when in fact she was not a student of any sort at all.  This seems to have engendered much discussion in the Stanford community, e.g.  here .  (The  LA Times  has a decent piece).
 
I mostly think the story is just sad, but a few thoughts:
 
 The security scare angle is a bit ridiculous, as is the blame game being played.
  I suspect the Stanford community is naive and high-strung about these things.  My friends who went to state schools say things like this happen all the time.  Besides, staffs in co-ops are sometimes happy to let vagrants hang out.  The motivations for and mechanics of her deception are clearly the important part of this story (e.g.  how did she live with herself? )
  Her first two quarters were in Kimball, then then her last quarter was in Okada.

<p>Introduction: At some point, I put extra email addresses on Facebook because I thought it was necessary for something, but didn’t want to show them, so in the privacy settings marked their visibility as “Only Me.”  It turns out that right now, Facebook is blatantly ignoring that privacy setting, and instead showing them to the world.

The motivations for and mechanics of her deception are clearly the important part of this story (e.g.  how did she live with herself? )

<p>Introduction: I don’t care how lame anyone thinks this is, but economic theorist  Ariel Rubinstein  is the shit.  He’s funny, self-deprecating, and brilliant.  I was just re-reading  his delightful, sarcastic review of Freakonomics .  (Overly dramatized visual depiction below; hey, conflict sells.)
 
    The review consists of excerpts from his own upcoming super-worldwide-bestseller, “Freak-Freakonomics”.  It is full of golden quotes such as: 
  Chapter 2: Why do economists earn more than mathematicians?  
 
…
 
The comparison between architects and prostitutes can be applied to mathematicians and economists: The former are more skilled, highly educated and intelligent.  
 
To elaborate: 
 Levitt has never encountered a girl who dreams of being a prostitute and I have never met a child who dreams of being an economist. Like prostitutes, the skill required of economists is “not necessarily ‘specialized’” (106). And, finally, here is a new explanation for the salary gap between mathematicians and eco</p><p>6 0.25688815 <a title="76-lsi-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-08-15-East_vs_West_cultural_psychology%21.html">110 brendan oconnor ai-2008-08-15-East vs West cultural psychology!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is fascinating — In China,  you can get fined if you make a map of China without Taiwan or other disputed territories .  Reminds me of being confused trying to find the primary airline of China.
 
   
 
Based of vague recollections of its name, I searched Google for  {{ china air }} .  The first hit was for  China Airlines .  But the second hit was  Air China .  The first is the state carrier of the ROC (Taiwan), the second is the PRC (mainland China).  Turns out my intended concept, “Official Chinese airline”, isn’t a coherent concept if your political worldview includes both the ROC and PRC as entities.  But maybe what I should have wanted was just airlines that fly around East Asia and various parts of China; in that case, getting both airlines is the right thing to do.  At least Google got them both at the top of the list.

<p>Introduction: I wish I knew Hebrew .  Well, fortunately there is also an English article version of  Equilibrium in the Jungle  (Piccione and Rubinstein ’06): 
 In the typical analysis of an exchange economy, agents are involved in consumption and exchange goods voluntarily when mutually beneficial. The endowments and the preferences are the primitives of the model. The distribution of consumption in society is determined endogenously through trade.  
 
This paper is motivated by a complementary perspective on human interaction. Throughout the history of mankind, it has been quite common (and we suspect that it will remain so in the future) that economic agents, individually or collectively, use power to seize control of assets held by others.  The exercise of power is pervasive in every society and takes several forms. Often, power is purely physical. Sometimes, however, power is more gentle.  In the male-female “market”, for example, charm and attraction play a key role in obtaining a favourite ma</p><p>same-blog 3 0.90726912 <a title="76-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-08-21-ConnectU.com_SQL_injection_vulnerability%3A_a_story_of_pathetic_hubris_%28and_fun_with_the_password_%E2%80%98password%E2%80%99%29.html">76 brendan oconnor ai-2007-08-21-ConnectU.com SQL injection vulnerability: a story of pathetic hubris (and fun with the password ‘password’)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is off-topic for this blog but here goes.   ConnectU , a small college social networking site, has been in the news due to their  apparently weak lawsuit against Facebook , in which they claim  Mark Zuckerberg  stole their business plan and computer code back when they all were Harvard undergraduates.  (Judges involved have noted the case’s flimsy evidence; some technology commentators — as well as everyone I know — have noted that the business idea wasn’t all that brilliant or original in the first place.)  Zuckerberg, of course, went on to found Facebook and bring it to incredible success.
 
I tried to use the ConnectU site recently, but got an error when searching for a funny name with an apostrophe,  o’connor .  It turns out this was symptomatic of a very grave security flaw in their code, an  SQL injection vulnerability .  While Facebook recently had  a minor security-related glitch , ConnectU’s flaw is far more serious.  A malicious attacker could use this to easily break in</p><p>4 0.40012401 <a title="76-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2004/brendan_oconnor_ai-2004-11-24-addiction_%26_2_problems_of_economics.html">2 brendan oconnor ai-2004-11-24-addiction & 2 problems of economics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is my idea based off of  Bernheim and Rangel’s  model of addict decision-making .  It’s a really neat model; it manages to relax rationality to allow someone to do something they don’t want to do because they’re addicted to it.  [Rationality assumes a nice well-ordered set of preferences; this model hypothesizes as distinction between emotional "liking" and cognitive, forward "wanting" that can conflict.]  The model is mathematically tractable, it can be used for public welfare analysis, and to top it off — it’s got neuroscientific grounding!
 
It appears to me there are two big criticisms of the economics discipline’s assumptions.  One of course is rationality.  The second has to do with the perfect structure of the market and environment that shapes both preferences and the ability to exercise them.  One critique is about social structure: consumers are not atomistic individual units, but rather exchange information and ideas along networks of patterned social relations.

<p>Introduction: I was planning to write some  WordNet  lookup code tonight.  But instead I’ve learned of too many intersecting things.
 
First, there are a zillion things to do this weekend ( hooray flavorpill ):
 
  Picasso and American Art  exhibit continuing at  SFMOMA .  I saw it very briefly last weekend but want some more.  And Doug claims there’s an interesting photography exhibit there too.
  Reading from  We Don’t Need Another Wave: Dispatches from the Next Generation of Feminists , a fascinating looking book I’ve seen many times in the bookstores around here.  By that I mean at least Modern Times (the neat Mission bookstore) and the Anarchist Collective Bookstore (out on the Haight).  And the reading is at Modern Times,  just down the street  from my house!  Amazing.  Tomorrow at 7:30.
  Since anarchists were just mentioned, fortuitously there also appears: the  Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair  this Saturday and Sunday!  Speakers and books down by Golden Gate Park, oh my.

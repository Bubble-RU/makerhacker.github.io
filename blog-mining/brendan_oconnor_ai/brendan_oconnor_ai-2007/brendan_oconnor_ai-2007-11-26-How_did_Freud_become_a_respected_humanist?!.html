Simpson’s paradox via R in three easy steps!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: R  has a fun built-in package,  datasets : a whole bunch of easy-to-use, interesting tables of data.  I found the famous UC Berkeley admissions data set, from a 1970′s study of whether sex discrimination existed in graduate admissions.  It’s famous for illustrating a particular statistical paradox.  Thanks to R’s awesome mosaic plots interface, we can see this really easily.
 
UCBAdmissions is a three-dimensional table (like a matrix): Admit Status x Gender x Dept, with counts for each category as the matrix’s values.  R’s default printing shows the basics just fine.  Here’s the data for just the first of six departments:
   >  UCBAdmissions 
, , Dept = A

          Gender
Admit      Male Female
  Admitted  512     89
  Rejected  313     19

...
 
  
Overall,  women have a lower admittance rate than men :

<p>Introduction: From an  NYT Magazine  article this Sunday, paraphrasing  Isaiah Berlin :
  
 The philosopher Isaiah Berlin once said that the trouble with academics and commentators is that they care more about whether ideas are interesting than whether they are true. Politicians live by ideas just as much as professional thinkers do, but they can’t afford the luxury of entertaining ideas that are merely interesting. They have to work with the small number of ideas that happen to be true and the even smaller number that happen to be applicable to real life. In academic life, false ideas are merely false and useless ones can be fun to play with. In political life, false ideas can ruin the lives of millions and useless ones can waste precious resources. An intellectual’s responsibility for his ideas is to follow their consequences wherever they may lead. A politician’s responsibility is to master those consequences and prevent them from doing harm.

<p>Introduction: Here is one of our exciting just-finished  ACL  papers.   David  and I designed an algorithm that learns different types of character personas — “Protagonist”, “Love Interest”, etc — that are used in movies.
 
To do this we collected a  brand new dataset : 42,306 plot summaries of movies from Wikipedia, along with metadata like box office revenue and genre.  We ran these through parsing and coreference analysis to also create a dataset of movie characters, linked with Freebase records of the actors who portray them.  Did you see that NYT article on  quantitative analysis of film scripts ?  This dataset could answer all sorts of things they assert in that article — for example, do movies with  bowling scenes  really make less money?  We have released  the data here .
 
Our focus, though, is on narrative analysis.  We investigate  character personas : familiar character types that are repeated over and over in stories, like “Hero” or “Villian”; maybe grand mythical archetypes like “Trick</p><p>4 0.44801649 <a title="84-lsi-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-08-05-Are_ideas_interesting%2C_or_are_they_true%3F.html">73 brendan oconnor ai-2007-08-05-Are ideas interesting, or are they true?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I’ve had several people ask me what the numbers in  ACL  reviews mean — and I can’t find anywhere online where they’re described.  (Can anyone point this out if it is somewhere?)
 
So here’s the review form, below.  They all go from 1 to 5, with 5 the best.  I think the review emails to authors only include a subset of the below — for example, “Overall Recommendation” is not included?
 
The CFP said that they have different types of review forms for different types of papers.  I think this one is for a standard full paper.  I guess what people  really  want to know is what scores tend to correspond to acceptances.  I really have no idea and I get the impression this can change year to year.  I have no involvement with the ACL conference besides being one of many, many reviewers.

<p>Introduction: Watching internet usage vs. income on the Gapminder.org visualizer is very interesting.
 
  
 
Several things are quite apparent.  (1) Internet usage exploded in all countries in the world.  (2) Richer countries have more internet usage (linear relationship on the scatterplot), but it’s been increasing in all countries regardless.
 
The animation has a few issues, of course — I think some of the funny, rapid movements at the very start are due to issues with when they started collecting reliable data on internet usage in the early 90′s, and the data probably started being more reliable at different times in different countries, etc.  
 
These are countervailing phenomena that require attention to variation within and across groups of data.  I can’t imagine pie charts or tables of numbers that could ever convey this level of nuance.
 
One last thing.  Going to the linear scale (so you can see differences in large amounts of internet use), watch South Korea vs. United States.  Korea, a c</p><p>2 0.95985901 <a title="84-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-05-24-Zipf%E2%80%99s_law_and_world_city_populations.html">141 brendan oconnor ai-2009-05-24-Zipf’s law and world city populations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Will Fitzgerald just wrote about  an excellent  article by Steven Strogatz  on Zipf’s Law for the populations of cities.  If you look at the biggest city, then the next biggest city, etc., there tends to be an exponential fall-off in size.
 
I was wondering what this looks like so here’s the classic zipfian plot (log-size vs. log-rank) for city population data from from  populationdata.net :
 
   
 
If you fit a power law — that is, a line on the above logsize-logrank plot — you can use rank to predict the sizes of smaller cities very accurately, according to Will’s analysis.  Larger cities are more problematic, lying off the line.
 
I was curious whether the power law holds  within  countries as well.  The above plot was only for the countries that had more than 10 cities in the dataset — just eight countries.  So here are those same cities again, but plotted against ranks within their respective countries.
 
   
 
The answer is — usually, yes, the power law looks like it holds within</p><p>3 0.92326599 <a title="84-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-05-13-The_best_natural_language_search_commentary_on_the_internet.html">102 brendan oconnor ai-2008-05-13-The best natural language search commentary on the internet</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Freud Is Widely Taught at Universities, Except in the Psychology Department :
  
PSYCHOANALYSIS and its ideas about the unconscious mind have spread to every nook and cranny of the culture from Salinger to “South Park,” from Fellini to foreign policy. Yet if you want to learn about psychoanalysis at the nation’s top universities, one of the last places to look may be the psychology department.


A new report by the American Psychoanalytic Association has found that while psychoanalysis — or what purports to be psychoanalysis — is alive and well in literature, film, history and just about every other subject in the humanities, psychology departments and textbooks treat it as “desiccated and dead,” a historical artifact instead of “an ongoing movement and a living, evolving process.”
  
I’ve been wondering about this for a while, ever since I heard someone describe Freud as “one of the greatest humanists who ever lived.”  I’m pretty sure he didn’t think of himself that way.  If you’re a</p><p>5 0.37451339 <a title="84-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2014/brendan_oconnor_ai-2014-02-19-What_the_ACL-2014_review_scores_mean.html">203 brendan oconnor ai-2014-02-19-What the ACL-2014 review scores mean</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve had several people ask me what the numbers in  ACL  reviews mean — and I can’t find anywhere online where they’re described.  (Can anyone point this out if it is somewhere?)
 
So here’s the review form, below.  They all go from 1 to 5, with 5 the best.  I think the review emails to authors only include a subset of the below — for example, “Overall Recommendation” is not included?
 
The CFP said that they have different types of review forms for different types of papers.  I think this one is for a standard full paper.  I guess what people  really  want to know is what scores tend to correspond to acceptances.  I really have no idea and I get the impression this can change year to year.  I have no involvement with the ACL conference besides being one of many, many reviewers.

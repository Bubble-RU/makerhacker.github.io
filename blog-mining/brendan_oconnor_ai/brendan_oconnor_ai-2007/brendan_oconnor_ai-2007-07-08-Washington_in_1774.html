<p>Introduction: In light of the Somali transitional government’s recent military triumph over Islamist forces, the BBC did a piece of  very interesting testimonials from everyday Somalis  — they all want a government for peace and order in their lives.  Anarchy is extremely unpopular.   (more info on this.)   A musician complains that since nightclubs are shut down, his only work is at occasional weddings, and adds: 
 The wedding parties are big, spectacular affairs, you wouldn’t think they were in a country without a government. 
 
But it’s only the people who are members of the big armed clans who can have these parties.
 
Other people get married but they cannot have big parties in case they are attacked and robbed. They just get married in secret.
 
I’ve been re-reading Hobbes and this sounds familiar — the enjoyment of all sorts of goods requires a strong organization protecting you, to deter would-be thieves.  That’s what a good government does.

<p>Introduction: I wish I knew Hebrew .  Well, fortunately there is also an English article version of  Equilibrium in the Jungle  (Piccione and Rubinstein ’06): 
 In the typical analysis of an exchange economy, agents are involved in consumption and exchange goods voluntarily when mutually beneficial. The endowments and the preferences are the primitives of the model. The distribution of consumption in society is determined endogenously through trade.  
 
This paper is motivated by a complementary perspective on human interaction. Throughout the history of mankind, it has been quite common (and we suspect that it will remain so in the future) that economic agents, individually or collectively, use power to seize control of assets held by others.  The exercise of power is pervasive in every society and takes several forms. Often, power is purely physical. Sometimes, however, power is more gentle.  In the male-female “market”, for example, charm and attraction play a key role in obtaining a favourite ma</p><p>4 0.050074719 <a title="69-tfidf-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-06-29-Evangelicals_vs._Aquarians.html">66 brendan oconnor ai-2007-06-29-Evangelicals vs. Aquarians</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Just read an interesting analysis on the the simultaneous rise of the cultural left and right (“hippies and evangelicals”) through the 50′s and 60′s.   Brink Lindsey argues here  that they were both reactions to post-war material prosperity:
  
On the left gathered those who were most alive to the new possibilities created by the unprecedented mass affluence of the postwar years but at the same time were hostile to the social institutions — namely, the market and the middle-class work ethic — that created those possibilities. On the right rallied those who staunchly supported the institutions that created prosperity but who shrank from the social dynamism they were unleashing. One side denounced capitalism but gobbled its fruits; the other cursed the fruits while defending the system that bore them. Both causes were quixotic, and consequently neither fully realized its ambitions.
  
I love  neat sweeping theories of history ; I can’t take it overly seriously but it is so fun.

<p>Introduction: I’m looking for recommendations for a good textbook/handbook/reference on (non-formal) linguistic semantics. Â My undergrad semantics course was almost entirely focused on logical/formal semantics, which is fine, but I don’t feel familiar with the breadth of substantive issues — for example, I’d be hard-pressed to explain why something like semantic/thematic role labeling should be useful for anything at all.
 
I somewhat randomly stumbled upon  Frawley 1992  ( review ) in a  used bookstore  and it seemed pretty good — in particular, it cleanly separates itself from the philosophical study of semantics, and thus identifies issues that seem amenable to computational modeling.
 
I’m wondering what else is out there?

<p>Introduction: Looks like it’s become a mini-series: Jared Diamond’s  Guns, Germs, and Steel has hit PBS!   Great book, if repetitive and a little too ambitious — he has a great environmental/technology explanation of the differences in societal development between Europe and the Americas, but he’s pretty weak when trying to tackle Asia vs. Europe, or a number of other situations talked about near the end of the book.  But anyway, it’s fantastic social science.

<p>Introduction: [I]t is not the wish, or the interest of the Government, or any other upon this Continent, separately, or collectively, to set up for Independence…  I am well satisfyed, as I can be of my existence, that no such thing is desired by any thinking man in all North America; on the contrary, that it is the ardent wish of the warmest advocates for liberty, that peace & tranquility, upon Constitutional grounds, may be restored, & the horrors of civil discord prevented.

<p>Introduction: This has to be the most quick-and-dirty data visualizer out there: I wrote an ascii art plotter script that takes a column of numbers on stdin and throws out a plot on your console.  I’ve been using it for several months to quickly look at numbers on the commandline, especially from logs and such.  (Back in school I would use gnuplot for this; R is good too.  But sometimes you want to move really fast, esp if you have a few hideous perl -pe one-liners on your hands and mucking around with temp files will interrupt your flow.)

<p>Introduction: Rational choice has been a huge imperialistic success, growing in popularity and being applied to more and more fields.  Why is this?  It’s not because the rational choice model of decision-making is particularly realistic.  Rather, it’s because rational choice is a  completely specified theory of human behavior , and therefore is great at generating hypotheses.  Given any situation involving people, rational choice can be used to generate a hypothesis about what to expect.  That is, you just ask, “What would a person do to maximize their own benefit?”
 
Similar things have been said about evolutionary psychology: you can always predict behavior by asking “what would hunter-gatherers do?”  Now, certainly both rational choice and evolutionary psychology don’t always generate  correct  hypotheses, but they’re incredibly useful because they at least give you a starting point.
 
Witness the theory of bounded rationality: just like rational choice, except amended to consider computational l</p><p>4 0.082403027 <a title="69-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-09-08-Another_R_flashmob_today.html">152 brendan oconnor ai-2009-09-08-Another R flashmob today</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Since I posted the link to his blog, Baron just  wrote about   Cardinal Schönborn’s anti-evolution Op-Ed piece .  I agree absolutely that people should learn about the psychology of judgment and probability for these sorts of questions, where it’s really hard to understand that random processes can generate things that seem not so random.
 
I’m still thinking about how the psychology of judgment plays in to  the analysis below .  I have a feeling that people’s intuitions are usually too hospitable for explanations based on intention.  E.g.: People are poor, therefore someone is trying to make them poor.  Organizations (corportations, governments) do things, therefore someone (say, at the top) ordered them to do these things.  Natural disasters happen, therefore someone is wishing them upon us.  Etc., etc.  I’m still not sure how a bayesian dissection of whether “looks intentful” implies “is intentful” shows us whether such an “intent-seeking” bias (hey, I have to call it something) is</p><p>6 0.082078144 <a title="69-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-06-10-Freak-Freakonomics_%28Ariel_Rubinstein_is_the_shit%21%29.html">63 brendan oconnor ai-2007-06-10-Freak-Freakonomics (Ariel Rubinstein is the shit!)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Experimental philosophy:  
 Suppose the chairman of a company has to decide whether to adopt a new program. It would increase profits and help the environment too. “I don’t care at all about helping the environment,” the chairman says. “I just want to make as much profit as I can. Let’s start the new program.” Would you say that the chairman intended to help the environment? 
 
O.K., same circumstance. Except this time the program would harm the environment. The chairman, who still couldn’t care less about the environment, authorizes the program in order to get those profits. As expected, the bottom line goes up, the environment goes down. Would you say the chairman harmed the environment intentionally?
 
in one survey, only 23 percent of people said that the chairman in the first situation had intentionally helped the environment. When they had to think about the second situation, though, fully 82 percent thought that the chairman had intentionally harmed the environment.

<p>Introduction: Before I forget — a while back I read a terrific Foreign Affairs article,  The Return of Authoritarian Great Powers .  The argument is, just a century or so ago, states based on authoritarian capitalism were very powerful in the world; e.g. imperial Japan and Germany.  They got plenty of the economic benefits of capitalism but not so much the democratic effects people like to talk about today.  (And there are interesting points that the failure of fascism in the second world war was contingent and not inherent to the ideology.)  The author argues this looks like the future: Russia and China are becoming economically strong world powers but keeping solidly non-democratic ways of governance.  The period of liberal democracy we live in, with all its overhyped speculation about the inevitable spread democracy and free market capitalism — say, an  “end of history”  — might just be that, a moment caused by the vagaries of 20th century history.

<p>Introduction: William Saletan, a writer for Slate, recently wrote  a loud series of articles  on genetic racial differences in IQ in the wake of James Watson’s  controversial remarks .  It prompted lots of discussion; here is an  excellent response from Richard Nisbett , a leading authority in the field on the environmentalist side of the debate.
 
More academic articles:  Rushton and Jensen’s 2005 review  of evidence for genetic differences; and what I’ve found to be the most balanced so far, the 1995 APA report  Inteligence: Knowns and Unknowns  which concludes for all the heated claims out there, the scientific evidence tends to be pretty weak.
 
Blog world:  Funny title from Brad DeLong ; and another  Slate response to Saletan and Rushton/Jensen .
 
The politics of the race and intelligence question is a huge distraction from trying to find out the actual truth of the matter.  But I suppose the political implications are why it attracts so much attention — for good or bad.

<p>Introduction: Working on applied AI-related problems has really tempered my outlook away from theory.  Apologies for another Rorty-related post, but I loved this little bit I just came across, from  Stanley Fish (on slate.com) : 
 When Rorty concluded one of his dramatically undramatic performances, the hands shot up like quivering spears, and the questions were hurled in outraged tones that were almost comically in contrast to the low-key withdrawn words that had provoked them. 
 
Why outrage? Because more often than not a Rortyan sentence would, with irritatingly little fuss, take away everything his hearers believed in. Take, for example, this little Rortyan gem: “Time will tell; but epistemology won’t.” That is to sayâ€”and the fact that I have recourse to the ponderously academic circumlocution “that is to say” tells its own (for me) sad storyâ€”if you’re putting your faith in some grandly ambitious account of the way we know things and hoping that if you get the account right, you will be that</p><p>6 0.338943 <a title="64-lsi-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2006/brendan_oconnor_ai-2006-03-18-Mark_Turner%3A_Toward_the_Founding_of_Cognitive_Social_Science.html">31 brendan oconnor ai-2006-03-18-Mark Turner: Toward the Founding of Cognitive Social Science</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Lately, I’ve been trying  to memorize very small tables, especially for better intuitions and rule-of-thumb calculations.  At the moment I have these above my desk:
 
   
 
The first one is a few entries in a natural logarithm table.  There are all these stories about how in the slide rule era, people would develop better intuitions about the scale of logarithms because they physically engaged with them all the time.  I spend lots of time looking at log-likelihoods, log-odds-ratios, and logistic regression coefficients, so I think it would be nice to have quick intuitions about what they are.  (Though the  Gelman and Hill  textbook has an interesting argument against odds scale interpretations of logistic regression coefficients.)
 
The second one are some zsh filename manipulation  shortcuts .  OK, this is more narrow than the others, but pretty useful for me at least.
 
The third one are rough unit equivalencies for data rates over time.

<p>Introduction: Richard Rorty, philosopher, dies at 75 .
 
I’ve read enough of the analytic philosophers castigating Rorty — and taken bits of classes from a few of them — that I feel I just have to love the man.
 
I remember managing to see him speak twice.  Once was on philosophy of mind at the good ol’ Sym Sys Forum.   (Video!)   (“He is wrong, but wrong in such an interesting way!” I remember one comment.)
 
Most fascinating was when he gamely participated in a discussion at this very odd Christian thought conference some groups on campus put together.  (The Veritas Forum,  here’s a link .)  He was standing there, arguing with the Christian conservatives about the nature and legitimacy of authority, but humorously ceding ground where appropriate… “Look, it’s not that all children will be active critical thinkers and discover everything for themselves.  Getting a kid a secular liberal education isn’t that much different than any other education — you have to beat it in to them.”  (That is a paraphr</p><p>3 0.26297867 <a title="64-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-12-26-What_is_experimental_philosophy%3F.html">87 brendan oconnor ai-2007-12-26-What is experimental philosophy?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Experimental philosophy:  
 Suppose the chairman of a company has to decide whether to adopt a new program. It would increase profits and help the environment too. “I don’t care at all about helping the environment,” the chairman says. “I just want to make as much profit as I can. Let’s start the new program.” Would you say that the chairman intended to help the environment? 
 
O.K., same circumstance. Except this time the program would harm the environment. The chairman, who still couldn’t care less about the environment, authorizes the program in order to get those profits. As expected, the bottom line goes up, the environment goes down. Would you say the chairman harmed the environment intentionally?
 
in one survey, only 23 percent of people said that the chairman in the first situation had intentionally helped the environment. When they had to think about the second situation, though, fully 82 percent thought that the chairman had intentionally harmed the environment.

<p>Introduction: update 2012-10-25 : I’ve been informed there is a new maintainer for Mawk, who has probably fixed the bugs I’ve been seeing.
  

From: Gert Hulselmans   


[The bugs you have found are] indeed true with mawk v1.3.3 which comes standard with Debian/Ubuntu.  This version is almost not developed the last 10 years.


I now already use mawk v1.3.4 maintained by another developer (Thomas E. Dickey) 
for more than a year on huge datafiles (sometimes several GB).


The problems/wrong results I had with mawk v1.3.3 sometimes are gone. In his version, normally all open/known bugs are fixed.


This version can be downloaded from:  http://invisible-island.net/mawk/ 

     update 2010-04-30  : I have since found large datasets where mawk is buggy and gives the wrong result.  nawk seems safe.   When one of these newfangled   “Big Data”   sets comes your way, the very first thing you have to do is data munging: shuffling around file formats, renaming fields and the like.

<p>Introduction: Everyone recently seems to be talking about  this newish paper by Digrazia, McKelvey, Bollen, and Rojas  ( pdf here ) that examines the correlation of Congressional candidate name mentions on Twitter against whether the candidate won the race.  One of the coauthors also wrote a Washington Post  Op-Ed  about it.  I read the paper and I think it’s reasonable, but their op-ed overstates their results.  It claims:
  
“In the 2010 data, our Twitter data predicted the winner in 404 out of 435 competitive races”
  
But this analysis is nowhere in their paper.  Fabio Rojas has now  posted errata/rebuttals  about the op-ed and described this analysis they did here.  There are several major issues off the bat:
  
 They didn’t ever predict 404/435 races; they only analyzed 406 races they call “competitive,” getting 92.5% (in-sample) accuracy, then extrapolated to all races to get the 435 number. 
 They’re reporting about  in-sample  predictions, which is really misleading to a non-scientific audi</p><p>6 0.22954637 <a title="64-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-11-12-Disease_tracking_with_web_queries_and_social_messaging_%28Google%2C_Twitter%2C_Facebook%E2%80%A6%29.html">123 brendan oconnor ai-2008-11-12-Disease tracking with web queries and social messaging (Google, Twitter, Facebook…)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I haven’t done a paper review on this blog for a while, so here we go.
 
 Coreference  resolution is an interesting NLP problem.  ( Examples. )  It involves honest-to-goodness syntactic, semantic, and discourse phenomena, but still seems like a real cognitive task that humans have to solve when reading text [1].  I haven’t read the whole literature, but I’ve always been puzzled by the crop of papers on it I’ve seen in the last year or two.  There’s a big focus on fancy graph/probabilistic/constrained optimization algorithms, but often these papers gloss over the linguistic features — the core information they actually make their decisions with [2].  I never understood why the latter isn’t the most important issue.  Therefore, it was a joy to read
  
 Aria Haghighi and Dan Klein, EMNLP-2009.   “Simple Coreference Resolution with Rich Syntactic and Semantic Features.”  
  
They describe a simple, essentially non-statistical system that outperforms previous unsupervised systems, and compa</p><p>5 0.085231051 <a title="65-tfidf-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-03-15-Feminists%2C_anarchists%2C_computational_complexity%2C_bounded_rationality%2C_nethack%2C_and_other_things_to_do.html">53 brendan oconnor ai-2007-03-15-Feminists, anarchists, computational complexity, bounded rationality, nethack, and other things to do</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was planning to write some  WordNet  lookup code tonight.  But instead I’ve learned of too many intersecting things.
 
First, there are a zillion things to do this weekend ( hooray flavorpill ):
 
  Picasso and American Art  exhibit continuing at  SFMOMA .  I saw it very briefly last weekend but want some more.  And Doug claims there’s an interesting photography exhibit there too.
  Reading from  We Don’t Need Another Wave: Dispatches from the Next Generation of Feminists , a fascinating looking book I’ve seen many times in the bookstores around here.  By that I mean at least Modern Times (the neat Mission bookstore) and the Anarchist Collective Bookstore (out on the Haight).  And the reading is at Modern Times,  just down the street  from my house!  Amazing.  Tomorrow at 7:30.
  Since anarchists were just mentioned, fortuitously there also appears: the  Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair  this Saturday and Sunday!  Speakers and books down by Golden Gate Park, oh my.

<p>Introduction: Experimental philosophy:  
 Suppose the chairman of a company has to decide whether to adopt a new program. It would increase profits and help the environment too. “I don’t care at all about helping the environment,” the chairman says. “I just want to make as much profit as I can. Let’s start the new program.” Would you say that the chairman intended to help the environment? 
 
O.K., same circumstance. Except this time the program would harm the environment. The chairman, who still couldn’t care less about the environment, authorizes the program in order to get those profits. As expected, the bottom line goes up, the environment goes down. Would you say the chairman harmed the environment intentionally?
 
in one survey, only 23 percent of people said that the chairman in the first situation had intentionally helped the environment. When they had to think about the second situation, though, fully 82 percent thought that the chairman had intentionally harmed the environment. There’s plen</p><p>5 0.42188117 <a title="65-lsi-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-05-29-%22Stanford_Impostor%22.html">62 brendan oconnor ai-2007-05-29-"Stanford Impostor"</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve gotten a zillion emails about it by now, but it was recently found that a young woman had been living for a year in Stanford dorms claiming to be a freshman, when in fact she was not a student of any sort at all.  This seems to have engendered much discussion in the Stanford community, e.g.  here .  (The  LA Times  has a decent piece).
 
I mostly think the story is just sad, but a few thoughts:
 
 The security scare angle is a bit ridiculous, as is the blame game being played.
  I suspect the Stanford community is naive and high-strung about these things.  My friends who went to state schools say things like this happen all the time.  Besides, staffs in co-ops are sometimes happy to let vagrants hang out.  The motivations for and mechanics of her deception are clearly the important part of this story (e.g.  how did she live with herself? )
  Her first two quarters were in Kimball, then then her last quarter was in Okada.

<p>Introduction: Working on applied AI-related problems has really tempered my outlook away from theory.  Apologies for another Rorty-related post, but I loved this little bit I just came across, from  Stanley Fish (on slate.com) : 
 When Rorty concluded one of his dramatically undramatic performances, the hands shot up like quivering spears, and the questions were hurled in outraged tones that were almost comically in contrast to the low-key withdrawn words that had provoked them. 
 
Why outrage? Because more often than not a Rortyan sentence would, with irritatingly little fuss, take away everything his hearers believed in. Take, for example, this little Rortyan gem: “Time will tell; but epistemology won’t.” That is to sayâ€”and the fact that I have recourse to the ponderously academic circumlocution “that is to say” tells its own (for me) sad storyâ€”if you’re putting your faith in some grandly ambitious account of the way we know things and hoping that if you get the account right, you will be that</p><p>2 0.28845972 <a title="65-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-11-12-Disease_tracking_with_web_queries_and_social_messaging_%28Google%2C_Twitter%2C_Facebook%E2%80%A6%29.html">123 brendan oconnor ai-2008-11-12-Disease tracking with web queries and social messaging (Google, Twitter, Facebook…)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a good idea: in a search engine’s query logs, look for outbreaks of queries like [[flu symptoms]] in a given region.  I’ve heard (from  Roddy ) that this trick also works well on Facebook statuses (e.g. “Feeling crappy this morning, think I just got the flu”).
  
  Google Uses Web Searches to Track Flu’s Spread – NYTimes.com  
  Google Flu Trends – google.org  
  
For an example with a publicly available data feed, these queries works decently well on Twitter search:
 
 [[ flu -shot -google ]]  (high recall)
 
 [[ "muscle aches" flu -shot ]]  (high precision)
     
 
The “muscle aches” query is too sparse and the general query is too noisy, but you could imagine some more tricks to clean it up, then train a classifier, etc.  With a bit more work it looks like geolocation information can be had out of the  Twitter search API .</p><p>3 0.28283864 <a title="65-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2014/brendan_oconnor_ai-2014-02-19-What_the_ACL-2014_review_scores_mean.html">203 brendan oconnor ai-2014-02-19-What the ACL-2014 review scores mean</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve had several people ask me what the numbers in  ACL  reviews mean — and I can’t find anywhere online where they’re described.  (Can anyone point this out if it is somewhere?)
 
So here’s the review form, below.  They all go from 1 to 5, with 5 the best.  I think the review emails to authors only include a subset of the below — for example, “Overall Recommendation” is not included?
 
The CFP said that they have different types of review forms for different types of papers.  I think this one is for a standard full paper.  I guess what people  really  want to know is what scores tend to correspond to acceptances.  I really have no idea and I get the impression this can change year to year.  I have no involvement with the ACL conference besides being one of many, many reviewers.
 
  
  
APPROPRIATENESS (1-5)
Does the paper fit in ACL 2014? (Please answer this question in light of the desire to broaden the scope of the research areas represented at ACL.)

<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: Rational choice has been a huge imperialistic success, growing in popularity and being applied to more and more fields.  Why is this?  It’s not because the rational choice model of decision-making is particularly realistic.  Rather, it’s because rational choice is a  completely specified theory of human behavior , and therefore is great at generating hypotheses.  Given any situation involving people, rational choice can be used to generate a hypothesis about what to expect.  That is, you just ask, “What would a person do to maximize their own benefit?”
 
Similar things have been said about evolutionary psychology: you can always predict behavior by asking “what would hunter-gatherers do?”  Now, certainly both rational choice and evolutionary psychology don’t always generate  correct  hypotheses, but they’re incredibly useful because they at least give you a starting point.
 
Witness the theory of bounded rationality: just like rational choice, except amended to consider computational l</p><p>6 0.27089024 <a title="65-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-04-17-1_billion_web_page_dataset_from_CMU.html">138 brendan oconnor ai-2009-04-17-1 billion web page dataset from CMU</a></p>

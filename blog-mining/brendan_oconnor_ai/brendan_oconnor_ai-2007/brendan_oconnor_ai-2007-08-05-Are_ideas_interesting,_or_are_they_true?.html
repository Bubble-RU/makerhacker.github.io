<p>Introduction: I’ve had several people ask me what the numbers in  ACL  reviews mean — and I can’t find anywhere online where they’re described.  (Can anyone point this out if it is somewhere?)
 
So here’s the review form, below.  They all go from 1 to 5, with 5 the best.  I think the review emails to authors only include a subset of the below — for example, “Overall Recommendation” is not included?
 
The CFP said that they have different types of review forms for different types of papers.  I think this one is for a standard full paper.  I guess what people  really  want to know is what scores tend to correspond to acceptances.  I really have no idea and I get the impression this can change year to year.  I have no involvement with the ACL conference besides being one of many, many reviewers.

<p>Introduction: The current subtitle is “where {political, social, economic} crosses {cognition, behavior, systems}”.  Amusingly enough, this syntax on a unix shell actually gets you the 9 combinations:

<p>Introduction: Working on applied AI-related problems has really tempered my outlook away from theory.  Apologies for another Rorty-related post, but I loved this little bit I just came across, from  Stanley Fish (on slate.com) : 
 When Rorty concluded one of his dramatically undramatic performances, the hands shot up like quivering spears, and the questions were hurled in outraged tones that were almost comically in contrast to the low-key withdrawn words that had provoked them. 
 
Why outrage? Because more often than not a Rortyan sentence would, with irritatingly little fuss, take away everything his hearers believed in. Take, for example, this little Rortyan gem: “Time will tell; but epistemology won’t.” That is to sayâ€”and the fact that I have recourse to the ponderously academic circumlocution “that is to say” tells its own (for me) sad storyâ€”if you’re putting your faith in some grandly ambitious account of the way we know things and hoping that if you get the account right, you will be that</p><p>6 0.061305966 <a title="73-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-11-26-How_did_Freud_become_a_respected_humanist%3F%21.html">84 brendan oconnor ai-2007-11-26-How did Freud become a respected humanist?!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: William Saletan, a writer for Slate, recently wrote  a loud series of articles  on genetic racial differences in IQ in the wake of James Watson’s  controversial remarks .  It prompted lots of discussion; here is an  excellent response from Richard Nisbett , a leading authority in the field on the environmentalist side of the debate.
 
More academic articles:  Rushton and Jensen’s 2005 review  of evidence for genetic differences; and what I’ve found to be the most balanced so far, the 1995 APA report  Inteligence: Knowns and Unknowns  which concludes for all the heated claims out there, the scientific evidence tends to be pretty weak.
 
Blog world:  Funny title from Brad DeLong ; and another  Slate response to Saletan and Rushton/Jensen .
 
The politics of the race and intelligence question is a huge distraction from trying to find out the actual truth of the matter.  But I suppose the political implications are why it attracts so much attention — for good or bad.

<p>Introduction: Some ex-hedge fund analysts recently started a non-profit devoted to evaluating the effectiveness of hundreds of charities, and  apparently have been making waves (NYT) .  A few interesting reports have been posted on their website,  givewell.net  — they make recommendations for which charities where donors’ money is used most efficiently for saving lives or helping the disadvantaged.
 
(Does anyone else have interesting data on charity effectiveness?  I’ve heard that evaluations are the big thing in philanthropy world now, and certainly the Gates Foundation talks a lot about it.)
 
Obviously this sort of evaluation is tricky, but it  has  to be the right approach.  The NYT article makes them sound like they’re a bit arrogant, which is too bad; on the other hand, any one who makes claims to have better empirical information than the established wisdom will always end up in that dynamic.

<p>Introduction: Freud Is Widely Taught at Universities, Except in the Psychology Department :
  
PSYCHOANALYSIS and its ideas about the unconscious mind have spread to every nook and cranny of the culture from Salinger to “South Park,” from Fellini to foreign policy. Yet if you want to learn about psychoanalysis at the nation’s top universities, one of the last places to look may be the psychology department.


A new report by the American Psychoanalytic Association has found that while psychoanalysis — or what purports to be psychoanalysis — is alive and well in literature, film, history and just about every other subject in the humanities, psychology departments and textbooks treat it as “desiccated and dead,” a historical artifact instead of “an ongoing movement and a living, evolving process.”
  
I’ve been wondering about this for a while, ever since I heard someone describe Freud as “one of the greatest humanists who ever lived.”  I’m pretty sure he didn’t think of himself that way.

<p>Introduction: Michael Jackson just died while Iran is in turmoil.  I am reminded of a passage in Marjane Satrapi’s wonderful graphic novel  Persepolis , a memoir of growing up in revolutionary Iran in the 80′s.

I wonder how much coincidences of news event timing can influence perceptions.  Clearly, large news stories can crowd out other ones.  Are there any other effects of joint appearances?  Celebrity deaths are fairly exogenous shocks — there might be a nice natural experiment somewhere here.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.96867836 <a title="73-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-08-05-Are_ideas_interesting%2C_or_are_they_true%3F.html">73 brendan oconnor ai-2007-08-05-Are ideas interesting, or are they true?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From an  NYT Magazine  article this Sunday, paraphrasing  Isaiah Berlin :
  
 The philosopher Isaiah Berlin once said that the trouble with academics and commentators is that they care more about whether ideas are interesting than whether they are true. Politicians live by ideas just as much as professional thinkers do, but they can’t afford the luxury of entertaining ideas that are merely interesting. They have to work with the small number of ideas that happen to be true and the even smaller number that happen to be applicable to real life. In academic life, false ideas are merely false and useless ones can be fun to play with. In political life, false ideas can ruin the lives of millions and useless ones can waste precious resources. An intellectual’s responsibility for his ideas is to follow their consequences wherever they may lead. A politician’s responsibility is to master those consequences and prevent them from doing harm.
  
I can’t speak for that level of politics, but I’ve</p><p>3 0.17205358 <a title="73-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-11-12-Disease_tracking_with_web_queries_and_social_messaging_%28Google%2C_Twitter%2C_Facebook%E2%80%A6%29.html">123 brendan oconnor ai-2008-11-12-Disease tracking with web queries and social messaging (Google, Twitter, Facebook…)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a good idea: in a search engine’s query logs, look for outbreaks of queries like [[flu symptoms]] in a given region.  I’ve heard (from  Roddy ) that this trick also works well on Facebook statuses (e.g. “Feeling crappy this morning, think I just got the flu”).
  
  Google Uses Web Searches to Track Flu’s Spread – NYTimes.com  
  Google Flu Trends – google.org  
  
For an example with a publicly available data feed, these queries works decently well on Twitter search:
 
 [[ flu -shot -google ]]  (high recall)
 
 [[ "muscle aches" flu -shot ]]  (high precision)
     
 
The “muscle aches” query is too sparse and the general query is too noisy, but you could imagine some more tricks to clean it up, then train a classifier, etc.  With a bit more work it looks like geolocation information can be had out of the  Twitter search API .</p><p>4 0.17202127 <a title="73-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-10-11-It_is_accurate_to_determine_a_blog%E2%80%99s_bias_by_what_it_links_to.html">117 brendan oconnor ai-2008-10-11-It is accurate to determine a blog’s bias by what it links to</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here’s a great project from Andy Baio and Joshua Schachter : they assessed the political biases of different blogs based on which articles they tend link to.  Using these political bias scores, they made a cool little Firefox extension that colors the names of different sources on the news aggregator site  Memeorandum , like so:
 
 
 
How they computed these biases is pretty neat.  Their data source was the Memeorandum site itself, which shows a particular news story, then a list of different news sites that have written articles about the topic.  Scraping out that data, Joshua constructed the adjacency matrix of sites vs. articles they linked to and ran good ol’  SVD  on it, an algorithm that can be used to summarize the very high-dimensional article linking information in just several numbers (“components” or “dimensions”) for each news site.  Basically, the algorithm groups together sites that tend to link to the same articles.  It’s not exactly clustering though; rather, it project</p><p>5 0.16841558 <a title="73-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2014/brendan_oconnor_ai-2014-02-19-What_the_ACL-2014_review_scores_mean.html">203 brendan oconnor ai-2014-02-19-What the ACL-2014 review scores mean</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve had several people ask me what the numbers in  ACL  reviews mean — and I can’t find anywhere online where they’re described.  (Can anyone point this out if it is somewhere?)
 
So here’s the review form, below.  They all go from 1 to 5, with 5 the best.  I think the review emails to authors only include a subset of the below — for example, “Overall Recommendation” is not included?
 
The CFP said that they have different types of review forms for different types of papers.  I think this one is for a standard full paper.  I guess what people  really  want to know is what scores tend to correspond to acceptances.  I really have no idea and I get the impression this can change year to year.  I have no involvement with the ACL conference besides being one of many, many reviewers.

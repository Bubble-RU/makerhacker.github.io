North Korea is “People’s Democratic Republic of Korea”, Libya is “Great Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya”, and the like.  But on the other hand, there’s plenty of counter-examples — it’s the “United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland” and “Republic of Cuba”, after all.

Several things are quite apparent.  (1) Internet usage exploded in all countries in the world.  (2) Richer countries have more internet usage (linear relationship on the scatterplot), but it’s been increasing in all countries regardless.

<p>Introduction: The latest on the world ideologies front –
 
In the light of Russia’s Georgia adventures, there’s been lots of talk whether this represents a new rise of authoritarian Russia, which is presumably another nail in the coffin for U.S.-led liberal democratic hegemony in the world.  Our “end of history” friend Francis Fukuyama just wrote an op-ed arguing that  Russia and China are still not big threats to liberal democracy .  There are some good points: Russia is behaving as an aggressive imperial power, but does not embrace a grand, exportable ideology with universal appeal.  Similarly with China.  They both still feel the need to pay lip service to democratic rituals and norms.  Even Nicholas Kristof’s hilarious column  chronicling his experience with China’s dubious protest registration system  concludes that even a pale mockery of democracy is progress.
 
I still like Azar Gat’s article which I wrote about last year, that  Russia and China represent authoritarian capitalism, which will</p><p>4 0.055229928 <a title="75-tfidf-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-10-11-It_is_accurate_to_determine_a_blog%E2%80%99s_bias_by_what_it_links_to.html">117 brendan oconnor ai-2008-10-11-It is accurate to determine a blog’s bias by what it links to</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here’s a great project from Andy Baio and Joshua Schachter : they assessed the political biases of different blogs based on which articles they tend link to.  Using these political bias scores, they made a cool little Firefox extension that colors the names of different sources on the news aggregator site  Memeorandum , like so:
 
 
 
How they computed these biases is pretty neat.  Their data source was the Memeorandum site itself, which shows a particular news story, then a list of different news sites that have written articles about the topic.  Scraping out that data, Joshua constructed the adjacency matrix of sites vs. articles they linked to and ran good ol’  SVD  on it, an algorithm that can be used to summarize the very high-dimensional article linking information in just several numbers (“components” or “dimensions”) for each news site.  Basically, the algorithm groups together sites that tend to link to the same articles.  It’s not exactly clustering though; rather, it project</p><p>5 0.052020773 <a title="75-tfidf-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-05-24-Zipf%E2%80%99s_law_and_world_city_populations.html">141 brendan oconnor ai-2009-05-24-Zipf’s law and world city populations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Will Fitzgerald just wrote about  an excellent  article by Steven Strogatz  on Zipf’s Law for the populations of cities.  If you look at the biggest city, then the next biggest city, etc., there tends to be an exponential fall-off in size.
 
I was wondering what this looks like so here’s the classic zipfian plot (log-size vs. log-rank) for city population data from from  populationdata.net :
 
   
 
If you fit a power law — that is, a line on the above logsize-logrank plot — you can use rank to predict the sizes of smaller cities very accurately, according to Will’s analysis.  Larger cities are more problematic, lying off the line.
 
I was curious whether the power law holds  within  countries as well.  The above plot was only for the countries that had more than 10 cities in the dataset — just eight countries.  So here are those same cities again, but plotted against ranks within their respective countries.

<p>Introduction: Is social science even worth doing when things like  this  get funded with hundreds of millions of federal dollars? 
 Many American youngsters participating in federally funded abstinence-only programs have been taught over the past three years that abortion can lead to sterility and suicide, that half the gay male teenagers in the United States have tested positive for the AIDS virus, and that touching a person’s genitals “can result in pregnancy,” a congressional staff analysis has found. 
 
…

  Among the misconceptions cited by Waxman’s investigators:
  • A 43-day-old fetus is a “thinking person.” • HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, can be spread via sweat and tears. • Condoms fail to prevent HIV transmission as often as 31 percent of the time in heterosexual intercourse.

<p>Introduction: Sometimes it seems bad countries come with long names.  North Korea is “People’s Democratic Republic of Korea”, Libya is “Great Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya”, and the like.  But on the other hand, there’s plenty of counter-examples — it’s the “United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland” and “Republic of Cuba”, after all.  Do long names with good-sounding adjectives correspond with non-democratic governments?
 
Fortunately, this can be tested.  First, what words are out there?  From the  CIA Factbook’s  data on long form names, here are some of the most popular words used by today’s countries, listed with the number of occurrences across all 194 names.  I limited to tokens that appear >= 3 times.  A majority of countries are Republics, while there are some Kingdoms, and even a few Democracies.

<p>Introduction: I keep learning new bits of linear algebra all the time, but I’m always hurting for a useful reference.  I probably should get a good book (which?), but in the meantime I’m collecting several nice online sources that ML researchers seem to often recommend: The Matrix Cookbook, plus a few more tutorial/introductory pieces, aimed at an intermediate-ish level.
 
Main reference:
  
  The Matrix Cookbook  – 71 pages of identities and such.  This seems to be really popular. 
  
Tutorials/introductions:
  
  CS229 linear algebra review  – from Stanford’s ML course.  It seems to introduce all the essentials, and it’s vaguely familiar for me.  (26 pages) 
 Minka’s  Old and New Matrix Algebra Useful for Statistics  – has a great part on how to do derivatives.  (19 pages) 
 MacKay’s  The Humble Gaussian  – OK, not really pure linear algebra anymore, but quite enlightening.  (12 pages) 
  
After studying for this last stats/ML midterm, I’ve now printed them out and stuck them in a binder.  A poor</p><p>3 0.24482056 <a title="75-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-04-05-Evil.html">56 brendan oconnor ai-2007-04-05-Evil</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I must be too cynical.  I thought I didn’t like  Philip Zimbardo ‘s theatrics, but regardless I really appreciated  this NYT interview  with him on the universal capacity for evil.     (S.P.E. is the  Stanford Prison Experiment , whose pictures here are from that lovely basement hallway, still there behind the 420-40 and 41 lecture rooms.)
 
In particular: 
 Q. What was your reaction when you first saw those photographs from Abu Ghraib? 
 
A. I was shocked. But not surprised. I immediately flashed on similar pictures from the S.P.E. What particularly bothered me was that the Pentagon blamed the whole thing on a “few bad apples.” I knew from our experiment, if you put good apples into a bad situation, you’ll get bad apples.
 
That was why I was willing to be an expert witness for Sgt. Chip Frederick, who was ultimately sentenced to eight years for his role at Abu Ghraib. Frederick was the Army reservist who was put in charge of the night shift at Tier 1A, where detainees were abused.

<p>Introduction: I’ve been a big fan of Reddit’s  Programing  subsite for a while.  Just this morning I found another sub-reddit:  SYSOR: Systems Science, Operations Research and Everything In Between , and I’m loving it.  Lots of links on data mining, graph software, image recognition, learning theory, etc etc.
 
Not sure if the Operations Research part in the title is so big now — there’s some sort of complicated reorganization of a number of fields including operations research, systems science, computational learning, and more general computer science areas.  I’m a fan of the great historical overview in the Introduction in  Rusell and Norvig’s AI book ; I’m sure it’s slanted in various ways, but what else are overarching narratives for?  :)</p><p>5 0.20983814 <a title="75-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-03-15-Computability_and_induction_and_ideal_rationality_and_the_simpsons.html">52 brendan oconnor ai-2007-03-15-Computability and induction and ideal rationality and the simpsons</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Don’t have time to read much right now, but received word about a neat-looking paper:  Uncomputability: The Problem of Induction Internalized  by Kevin Kelly.
 
Kevin Kelly’s website has an awesome statement that mirrors thoughts I’ve been having for the last few years — the incredible importance of computational constraints applied to reasoning and rationality:
  
Kuhn teaches that a single, deep success suffices to keep a competing paradign on the table.  Not surprisingly, computational learning theory shows its superiority over ideal theories of rationality when we trade in our ideal agents for more realistic, computable agents.  The foundation of the deep success is a strong structural analogy between the halting problem and the problem of inductive generalization, allowing for a unified treatment of both, from the ground up.  One consequence of the approach is that one can often show that computable agents are forced to choose between ideal rationality and finding the right answer</p><p>6 0.20413506 <a title="75-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-12-03-Statistics_vs._Machine_Learning%2C_fight%21.html">129 brendan oconnor ai-2008-12-03-Statistics vs. Machine Learning, fight!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Upload your poker hand histories to  www.pokernomics.com , economist Stephen Levitt’s fringe-of-economics project to study what are effective strategies in poker.  This absolultely makes sense to me as an economics research project, only because I’m used to thinking of economics from the view of multi-agent systems and game theory…  This is definitely all about game theory, maybe not economics.  Game theory reaches beyond the bounds of the study of goods and services…

<p>Introduction: I wish I knew Hebrew .  Well, fortunately there is also an English article version of  Equilibrium in the Jungle  (Piccione and Rubinstein ’06): 
 In the typical analysis of an exchange economy, agents are involved in consumption and exchange goods voluntarily when mutually beneficial. The endowments and the preferences are the primitives of the model. The distribution of consumption in society is determined endogenously through trade.  
 
This paper is motivated by a complementary perspective on human interaction. Throughout the history of mankind, it has been quite common (and we suspect that it will remain so in the future) that economic agents, individually or collectively, use power to seize control of assets held by others.  The exercise of power is pervasive in every society and takes several forms. Often, power is purely physical. Sometimes, however, power is more gentle.  In the male-female “market”, for example, charm and attraction play a key role in obtaining a favourite ma</p><p>4 0.083340615 <a title="63-tfidf-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2006/brendan_oconnor_ai-2006-08-30-A_big%2C_fun_list_of_links_I%E2%80%99m_reading.html">44 brendan oconnor ai-2006-08-30-A big, fun list of links I’m reading</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since blogging is hard, but reading is easy, lately I’ve taken to bookmarking interesting articles I’m reading, with the plan of blogging about them later.  This follow-through has happened a few times, but not that often.  In an amazing moment of thesis procrastination, today I sat down and figured out how to turn my  del.icio.us bookmarks  into a nice blogpost, with the plan that every week a post will appear with links I’ve recently read, or maybe I’ll use the script to generate a draft for myself that I’ll revise, or something.
 
But for this first such link post, I put in a whole bunch of them beyond just the last week — why have just a few when you could have *all* of them?  Future link posts will be shorter, I promise.

<p>Introduction: I’ve had several people ask me what the numbers in  ACL  reviews mean — and I can’t find anywhere online where they’re described.  (Can anyone point this out if it is somewhere?)
 
So here’s the review form, below.  They all go from 1 to 5, with 5 the best.  I think the review emails to authors only include a subset of the below — for example, “Overall Recommendation” is not included?
 
The CFP said that they have different types of review forms for different types of papers.  I think this one is for a standard full paper.  I guess what people  really  want to know is what scores tend to correspond to acceptances.  I really have no idea and I get the impression this can change year to year.  I have no involvement with the ACL conference besides being one of many, many reviewers.

<p>Introduction: Either God is tricky, or maybe probability is.
 
Pascal’s Wager: Say there’s only a small chance God exists.  If you are an atheist but God does actually exist, He will send you to hell for eternity.  This is infinitely bad.  Therefore you should believe in God on the off-chance he does exist, since a small chance of something infinitely bad is worse than the alternative.
 
 Believe in Pascal’s Wager?  Have I got a deal for you!  says if you believe it, you should send Alex Tabarrok money because he will put in a good word to God for you.  Hey, there’s a small chance he has a direct line to God, which yields infinite utility (or avoids hell’s infinite disutility).
 
FWIW, I’m thinking the paradoxes in this sort of arithmetic always happen when you start doing addition/multiplication distribution across those darn infinities.  Like on the third page Tabarrok starts talking about p1*Inf – p2*Inf = (p1-p2)*Inf.  That’s shady shit.

The exercise of power is pervasive in every society and takes several forms. Often, power is purely physical. Sometimes, however, power is more gentle.  In the male-female “market”, for example, charm and attraction play a key role in obtaining a favourite ma</p><p>6 0.44349286 <a title="63-lsi-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2006/brendan_oconnor_ai-2006-08-30-A_big%2C_fun_list_of_links_I%E2%80%99m_reading.html">44 brendan oconnor ai-2006-08-30-A big, fun list of links I’m reading</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Since I posted the link to his blog, Baron just  wrote about   Cardinal Schönborn’s anti-evolution Op-Ed piece .  I agree absolutely that people should learn about the psychology of judgment and probability for these sorts of questions, where it’s really hard to understand that random processes can generate things that seem not so random.
 
I’m still thinking about how the psychology of judgment plays in to  the analysis below .  I have a feeling that people’s intuitions are usually too hospitable for explanations based on intention.  E.g.: People are poor, therefore someone is trying to make them poor.  Organizations (corportations, governments) do things, therefore someone (say, at the top) ordered them to do these things.  Natural disasters happen, therefore someone is wishing them upon us.  Etc., etc.  I’m still not sure how a bayesian dissection of whether “looks intentful” implies “is intentful” shows us whether such an “intent-seeking” bias (hey, I have to call it something) is</p><p>2 0.99874878 <a title="63-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-09-15-Dollar_auction.html">77 brendan oconnor ai-2007-09-15-Dollar auction</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I got nervous and panicky just reading about this game.  I wonder if I could con some people into playing it.
  
Economics professors have a standard game they use to demonstrate how apparently rational decisions can create a disastrous result. They call it a “dollar auction.” The rules are simple. The professor offers a dollar for sale to the highest bidder, with only one wrinkle: the second-highest bidder has to pay up on their losing bid as well. Several students almost always get sucked in. The first bids a penny, looking to make 99 cents. The second bids 2 cents, the third 3 cents, and so on, each feeling they have a chance at something good on the cheap. The early stages are fun, and the bidders wonder what possessed the professor to be willing to lose some money.


The problem surfaces when the bidders get up close to a dollar. After 99 cents the last vestige of profitability disappears, but the bidding continues between the two highest players. They now realize that they stand</p><p>3 0.9980315 <a title="63-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-06-05-Clinton-Obama_support_visualization.html">105 brendan oconnor ai-2008-06-05-Clinton-Obama support visualization</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Rational choice has been a huge imperialistic success, growing in popularity and being applied to more and more fields.  Why is this?  It’s not because the rational choice model of decision-making is particularly realistic.  Rather, it’s because rational choice is a  completely specified theory of human behavior , and therefore is great at generating hypotheses.  Given any situation involving people, rational choice can be used to generate a hypothesis about what to expect.  That is, you just ask, “What would a person do to maximize their own benefit?”
 
Similar things have been said about evolutionary psychology: you can always predict behavior by asking “what would hunter-gatherers do?”  Now, certainly both rational choice and evolutionary psychology don’t always generate  correct  hypotheses, but they’re incredibly useful because they at least give you a starting point.
 
Witness the theory of bounded rationality: just like rational choice, except amended to consider computational l</p><p>same-blog 6 0.99680698 <a title="63-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-06-10-Freak-Freakonomics_%28Ariel_Rubinstein_is_the_shit%21%29.html">63 brendan oconnor ai-2007-06-10-Freak-Freakonomics (Ariel Rubinstein is the shit!)</a></p>

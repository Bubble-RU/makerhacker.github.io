<p>Introduction: Here are two great reviews, from 2003 then 2005.
 
1)  PLoS Biology: Economy of the Mind  nicely reviews the field and many interesting experiments.
 
One annoyance: They need to say “Banburismus” is more commonly known as Bayesian learning.  (Banbury, England was a city near Bletchley Park they got their paper from when doing Bayesian statistical codebreaking of the Enigma cipher in World War II.   Read the story here  in MacKay’s excellent free online  textbook .)   Thanks to  neurodudes  for the PLoS link.
 
2)  Neuroeconomics: How neuroscience can inform economics  is written by the leaders of the field, advocating their approach.  I like the detail and their careful descriptions of how cognitive neuroscience findings can enhance our understanding of economic phenomena.
 
Also, the second is useful to read since it’s the target of criticism by the more recent  The case for mindless economics , which I view as an empire-strikes-back sort of paper.

<p>Introduction: Since blogging is hard, but reading is easy, lately I’ve taken to bookmarking interesting articles I’m reading, with the plan of blogging about them later.  This follow-through has happened a few times, but not that often.  In an amazing moment of thesis procrastination, today I sat down and figured out how to turn my  del.icio.us bookmarks  into a nice blogpost, with the plan that every week a post will appear with links I’ve recently read, or maybe I’ll use the script to generate a draft for myself that I’ll revise, or something.
 
But for this first such link post, I put in a whole bunch of them beyond just the last week — why have just a few when you could have *all* of them?  Future link posts will be shorter, I promise.

From an  Andrew Gelman article  on summaring a linear regression as a simple difference between upper and lower categories.  I get the impression there are lots of weird misunderstood corners of linear models… (e.g. that “least squares regression” is a maximum likelihood estimator for a linear model with normal noise… I know so many people who didn’t learn that from their stats whatever course, and therefore find it mystifying why squared error should be used…  see this  other post from Gelman .)</p><p>6 0.087419696 <a title="55-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-01-23-SF_conference_for_data_mining_mercenaries.html">133 brendan oconnor ai-2009-01-23-SF conference for data mining mercenaries</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Not much on this blog lately, so I’ll repost a comment I just wrote on whether to use pairwise vs. absolute judgments for relevance quality evaluation.  (A fun one I know!)
 
From  this post on the Dolores Labs blog .
 
The paper being talked about is  Here or There: Preference Judgments for Relevance  by Carterette et al.
  
I skimmed through the Carterette paper and it’s interesting. My concern with pairwise setup is, in order to get comparability among query-result pairs, you need to get annotators to do an O(N^2) amount of work. (Unless you do something horribly complicated with partial orders.) The absolute judgment task scales linearly, of course. Given the AMT environment and a fixed budget, if I stay in the smaller-volume task, instead of spending a lot on a quadratic taskload, I can simply get a higher number of workers per result and boil out more noise. Of course, if it’s true the pairwise judgment task is easier — as the paper claims — that might make my spending more effic</p><p>5 0.43085498 <a title="55-lsi-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-05-16-Online_Deliberation_2005_conference_blog_%26_more_is_up%21.html">4 brendan oconnor ai-2005-05-16-Online Deliberation 2005 conference blog & more is up!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I wrote an interactive visualization for Gaussian mixtures and some probability laws, using the excellent  Protovis  library. Â It helped me build intuition for the law of total variance.

<p>Introduction: I saw  Seth Roberts  briefly speak today (at an  odd event ) about self-experimentation.  He tried drinking flavorless sugar water and it led him to lose lots of weight.  He also did a great variety of other self-experiments over more than a decade,  written up here  (and IMHO the other ones are much more interesting).
 
I briefly spoke to him there and told him I heard about his work from  Andrew Gelman’s blog .  He seemed surprised to (semi-)randomly meet someone who reads it.  I think this is mistaken — that particular blog seems quite popular in statistics/social science world.  In fact, Gelman’s blogging of Roberts’ self-experimentation paper got picked up by the Freakonomics folks and it became a sensation and then a book deal.  ( Story. )
 
Also note, John Langford says of his own  machine learning blog :

<p>Introduction: I’ve had several people ask me what the numbers in  ACL  reviews mean — and I can’t find anywhere online where they’re described.  (Can anyone point this out if it is somewhere?)
 
So here’s the review form, below.  They all go from 1 to 5, with 5 the best.  I think the review emails to authors only include a subset of the below — for example, “Overall Recommendation” is not included?
 
The CFP said that they have different types of review forms for different types of papers.  I think this one is for a standard full paper.  I guess what people  really  want to know is what scores tend to correspond to acceptances.  I really have no idea and I get the impression this can change year to year.  I have no involvement with the ACL conference besides being one of many, many reviewers.
 
  
  
APPROPRIATENESS (1-5)
Does the paper fit in ACL 2014? (Please answer this question in light of the desire to broaden the scope of the research areas represented at ACL.)

<p>Introduction: This is a good idea: in a search engine’s query logs, look for outbreaks of queries like [[flu symptoms]] in a given region.  I’ve heard (from  Roddy ) that this trick also works well on Facebook statuses (e.g. “Feeling crappy this morning, think I just got the flu”).
  
  Google Uses Web Searches to Track Flu’s Spread – NYTimes.com  
  Google Flu Trends – google.org  
  
For an example with a publicly available data feed, these queries works decently well on Twitter search:
 
 [[ flu -shot -google ]]  (high recall)
 
 [[ "muscle aches" flu -shot ]]  (high precision)
     
 
The “muscle aches” query is too sparse and the general query is too noisy, but you could imagine some more tricks to clean it up, then train a classifier, etc.  With a bit more work it looks like geolocation information can be had out of the  Twitter search API .</p><p>5 0.3534576 <a title="55-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-06-10-Freak-Freakonomics_%28Ariel_Rubinstein_is_the_shit%21%29.html">63 brendan oconnor ai-2007-06-10-Freak-Freakonomics (Ariel Rubinstein is the shit!)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I don’t care how lame anyone thinks this is, but economic theorist  Ariel Rubinstein  is the shit.  He’s funny, self-deprecating, and brilliant.  I was just re-reading  his delightful, sarcastic review of Freakonomics .  (Overly dramatized visual depiction below; hey, conflict sells.)
 
    The review consists of excerpts from his own upcoming super-worldwide-bestseller, “Freak-Freakonomics”.  It is full of golden quotes such as: 
  Chapter 2: Why do economists earn more than mathematicians?  
 
…
 
The comparison between architects and prostitutes can be applied to mathematicians and economists: The former are more skilled, highly educated and intelligent.  
 
To elaborate: 
 Levitt has never encountered a girl who dreams of being a prostitute and I have never met a child who dreams of being an economist. Like prostitutes, the skill required of economists is “not necessarily ‘specialized’” (106). And, finally, here is a new explanation for the salary gap between mathematicians and eco</p><p>6 0.35216004 <a title="55-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-09-02-cognitive_modelling_is_rational_choice%2B%2B.html">26 brendan oconnor ai-2005-09-02-cognitive modelling is rational choice++</a></p>

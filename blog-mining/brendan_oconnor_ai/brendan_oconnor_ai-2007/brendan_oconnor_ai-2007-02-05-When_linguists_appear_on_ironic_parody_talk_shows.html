<p>Introduction: Continuing  our previous story : they’ve won!  Check out the interview at the end of the semifinals here.
 
      
 
NYT  reports : 
 ATHENS, May 20 (AP) â€” In what some fans called a stunning upset, a Finnish heavy metal band with monster masks and apocalyptic lyrics won the Eurovision Song Contest late Saturday. 
 
The band, Lordi, caused a bit of a national identity crisis in Finland, where opponents accused it of devil worship and cringed at the thought that it might win.
 
The annual kitsch extravaganza, which was the springboard for the Swedish group Abba and Celine Dion, is known for its bland dance music and bubble-gum pop acts. This year groups from 24 countries faced off before tens of millions on television.
 
The band’s members do not disclose their real names. The lead singer, Mr. Lordi, said its win, Finland’s first, was “a victory for open-mindedness.” “We are not Satanists,” he said. “This is entertainment.”</p><p>3 0.078884676 <a title="49-tfidf-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-07-07-Happiness_incarnate_on_the_Colbert_Report.html">67 brendan oconnor ai-2007-07-07-Happiness incarnate on the Colbert Report</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A bit ago I finished Daniel Gilbert’s “Stumbling on Happiness,” which despite its name, is not about how to be happy.  It’s about why people are bad at predicting (and remembering) their happiness levels.  (Pop science psychology, not pop psychology… something like that.)  I liked a bit of it mainly because it has an entertaining overview of some cognitive psychology.  A few very interesting happiness experiments get presented, but if your friend tells you about them before you read the book, it’s all over.
 
Perhaps more amusing is stumbling on Gilbert’s quite entertaining appearance on the Colbert Report last week:</p><p>4 0.078688473 <a title="49-tfidf-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-07-05-finding_some_decision_science_blogs.html">16 brendan oconnor ai-2005-07-05-finding some decision science blogs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Decision Science News  looks active & useful.  The cognitive neuroscience of decision making is such a great topic — I mean, there are  studies of the neurobiology of sarcasm !

<p>Introduction: Working on applied AI-related problems has really tempered my outlook away from theory.  Apologies for another Rorty-related post, but I loved this little bit I just came across, from  Stanley Fish (on slate.com) : 
 When Rorty concluded one of his dramatically undramatic performances, the hands shot up like quivering spears, and the questions were hurled in outraged tones that were almost comically in contrast to the low-key withdrawn words that had provoked them. 
 
Why outrage? Because more often than not a Rortyan sentence would, with irritatingly little fuss, take away everything his hearers believed in. Take, for example, this little Rortyan gem: “Time will tell; but epistemology won’t.” That is to sayâ€”and the fact that I have recourse to the ponderously academic circumlocution “that is to say” tells its own (for me) sad storyâ€”if you’re putting your faith in some grandly ambitious account of the way we know things and hoping that if you get the account right, you will be that</p><p>6 0.039844017 <a title="49-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2011/brendan_oconnor_ai-2011-02-19-Move_to_brenocon.com.html">165 brendan oconnor ai-2011-02-19-Move to brenocon.com</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The Stanford Engineering school has put up videos and course materials for several programming, AI, and optimization courses online.  They did get some of the ones that are taught by excellent lecturers — e.g. introductory programming (the CS dept has craploads of money, so can afford to hire specialist lecturers, which results in very good courses), and Brad Osgood on the FFT (he’s just such a good lecturer).
 
 Main link ,  minor link. 
 
I was looking through the transcript of  Chris Manning’s introductory lecture  for CS224N, Natural Language Processing, last year.  ( SEE link ;  actual website link .)  I took this same course years ago as a sophomore, and this part sounded familiar:
  
So if you look at the early history of NLP, NLP essentially started in the 1950s. It started just after World War II in the beginning of the Cold War.

<p>Introduction: re  @andrewparker :
  
 My iPhone auto-corrected “Harvard” to “Garbage”. Well played Apple engineers. 
  
I was wondering how this would happen, and then noticed that each character pair has 0 to 2 distance on the QWERTY keyboard.  Perhaps their model is eager to allow QWERTY-local character substitutions.
  
 
>>> zip(‘harvard’,'garbage’) 
[('h', 'g'), ('a', 'a'), ('r', 'r'), ('v', 'b'), ('a', 'a'), ('r', 'g'), ('d', 'e')]
 
  
And then most any language model thinks p(“garbage”) > p(“harvard”), at the very least in a unigram model with a broad domain corpus.  So if it’s a noisy channel-style model, they’re underpenalizing the edit distance relative to the LM prior.  (Reference:  Norvig’s noisy channel spelling correction article .)
 
On the other hand, given how  insane iPhone autocorrections are , and from the number of times I’ve seen it delete a quite reasonable word I wrote, I’d bet “harvard” isn’t even in their LM.  (Where the LM is more like just a dictionary; call it quantizin</p><p>3 0.0 <a title="49-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2004/brendan_oconnor_ai-2004-11-20-gintis%3A_theoretical_unity_in_the_social_sciences.html">1 brendan oconnor ai-2004-11-20-gintis: theoretical unity in the social sciences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Herbert Gintis thinks  it’s time to unify the behavioral sciences. Sociology, economics, political science, human biology, anthropology and others all study the same thing, but each is based on different incompatible models of individual human behavior. There seems to be evidence that new developments have the potential to offer a more unifying theory. Evolutionary biology should be the basis of understanding much of human behavior. Rational choice and game theoretic frameworks are finding greater acceptance beyond economics; in the meantime, other fields need to absorb sociology’s emphasis on socialization — that people do things or understand the world in a way taught by society. The human behavioral sciences are still rife with many smaller inconsistencies; for example, according to Gintis, only anthropolgists look at the influence of culture across groups, but only sociologists look at culture within groups.
 
Gintis’ ultimate goal is to have a common baseline from which each disci</p><p>4 0.0 <a title="49-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2004/brendan_oconnor_ai-2004-11-24-addiction_%26_2_problems_of_economics.html">2 brendan oconnor ai-2004-11-24-addiction & 2 problems of economics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is my idea based off of  Bernheim and Rangel’s  model of addict decision-making .  It’s a really neat model; it manages to relax rationality to allow someone to do something they don’t want to do because they’re addicted to it.  [Rationality assumes a nice well-ordered set of preferences; this model hypothesizes as distinction between emotional "liking" and cognitive, forward "wanting" that can conflict.]  The model is mathematically tractable, it can be used for public welfare analysis, and to top it off — it’s got neuroscientific grounding!
 
It appears to me there are two big criticisms of the economics discipline’s assumptions.  One of course is rationality.  The second has to do with the perfect structure of the market and environment that shapes both preferences and the ability to exercise them.  One critique is about social structure: consumers are not atomistic individual units, but rather exchange information and ideas along networks of patterned social relations.  (Socia</p><p>5 0.0 <a title="49-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2004/brendan_oconnor_ai-2004-12-02-go_science.html">3 brendan oconnor ai-2004-12-02-go science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Is social science even worth doing when things like  this  get funded with hundreds of millions of federal dollars? 
 Many American youngsters participating in federally funded abstinence-only programs have been taught over the past three years that abortion can lead to sterility and suicide, that half the gay male teenagers in the United States have tested positive for the AIDS virus, and that touching a person’s genitals “can result in pregnancy,” a congressional staff analysis has found. 
 
…

  Among the misconceptions cited by Waxman’s investigators:
  • A 43-day-old fetus is a “thinking person.” • HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, can be spread via sweat and tears. • Condoms fail to prevent HIV transmission as often as 31 percent of the time in heterosexual intercourse.
 
…
 
When used properly and consistently, condoms fail to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) less than 3 percent of the time, federal researchers say, and it is not known how many gay teena</p><p>6 0.0 <a title="49-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-05-16-Online_Deliberation_2005_conference_blog_%26_more_is_up%21.html">4 brendan oconnor ai-2005-05-16-Online Deliberation 2005 conference blog & more is up!</a></p>

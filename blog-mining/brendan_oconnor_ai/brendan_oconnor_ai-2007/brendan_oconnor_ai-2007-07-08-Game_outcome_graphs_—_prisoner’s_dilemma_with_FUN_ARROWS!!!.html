Its default presentation is pretty mathematical.  This is good because it treats social interactions in an abstract way, highlighting their essential properties, but is bad because it’s hard to understand, especially at first.
 
However, I think I have a visualization that can sometimes capture the same abstract properties of the mathematics.  Here’s a stab at using it to explain everyone’s favorite game, the prisoner’s dilemma.
 
THE PD: Two players each choose whether to play nice, or be mean — Cooperate or Defect.  Then they simultaneously play their actions, and get payoffs depending on what both played.  If both cooperated, they help each other and do well; if both defect, they do quite poorly.  But if one tries to cooperate and the other defects, then the defector gets a big win, and the cooperator gets a crappy “sucker’s payoff”.
 
The formal PD definition looks like this:

[sent-9, score-0.471]
</p><p>2 The formal PD definition looks like this:         where each of the four pairs represents the ( row player payoff ,  column player payoff ) for that pair of choices. [sent-10, score-1.024]
</p><p>3 Here’s a new diagram that puts in example values for the payoffs:         The (C,C) outcome gets a payoff of 2 for each person, whereas the (D,D) payoff gets 1 for each person. [sent-20, score-1.168]
</p><p>4 The notation X   Y  means that outcome Y is a Pareto improvement over X. [sent-24, score-0.393]
</p><p>5 There are no other Pareto improvements among the outcomes in this game, just this one (D,D)   (C,C). [sent-25, score-0.382]
</p><p>6 If he is planning to cooperate, then you could either cooperate also, or else defect and exploit him. [sent-29, score-0.722]
</p><p>7 If he is planning to defect, your choice is either to cooperate and be a sucker, or else defect as well. [sent-31, score-0.77]
</p><p>8 This diagram shows their preferences over outcomes they control. [sent-34, score-0.416]
</p><p>9 Remember, the row player’s payoffs are the left side of each pair, and the column player’s payoffs are the right side of each pair. [sent-35, score-0.368]
</p><p>10 ‘s can only appear horizontally or vertically, since they represent a relationship between outcomes that only exists between outcomes whose difference is only in the decision of one player. [sent-37, score-0.602]
</p><p>11 (The difference between the diagonal outcomes (C,C) and (D,D) requires a change by both players; it is not due to a mere unilateral choice. [sent-38, score-0.352]
</p><p>12 )   Looking at the diagram, it’s clear the individual incentives are very stark: each player should defect under all circumstances. [sent-39, score-0.743]
</p><p>13 )  There is only one outcome that only has arrows flowing in and not out: D,D. [sent-41, score-0.54]
</p><p>14 If an outcome only has incoming   arrows, and no outgoing ones, it is a  Nash equilibrium . [sent-42, score-0.359]
</p><p>15 It’s similar to a PD, except the cooperation payoff is better than exploitation payoff. [sent-51, score-0.514]
</p><p>16 If you were absolutely certain your opponent was going to defect, you should defect too just like in the PD. [sent-56, score-0.4]
</p><p>17 I confess that I rather like diagramming out the incentive and payoff relationships between outcomes; I find it far more informative and instructive compared to staring at the arithmetic/algebraic tables and trying to figure it out in my head. [sent-60, score-0.429]
</p><p>18 To give credit where credit is due, I’ve seen the unilateral-selfish-choice arrows in only one place,  Jim Fearon ‘s excellent lecture notes, though he is not to blame for all this new crap I threw in. [sent-62, score-0.412]
</p><p>19 The arrows get really useful if you start working with games that have more than 4 outcomes, since as long as the game is discrete and you can lay out the outcomes in two dimensions, you usually can draw a bunch of graph edges between them. [sent-63, score-0.751]

<p>Introduction: Rock, Paper, Scissors is making the blog rounds with an excellent strategy guide  from the World RPS Society  and a fun  mental floss article  too.  (Though the  First International RoShamBo programming contest  should be noted.)  Having played far too much RPS last year, I can say these tips look pretty decent for the most part.  I will say I am a huge fan of the elegant move Running With Scissors — scissors three times in a row.  “You think I’m crazy enough to play that AGAIN?”  Un-frickin-stoppable.
 
Everyone thinks, “but wait, RPS is a lame game.  Playing randomly is the best strategy!”  This is not true.  Playing randomly is the best defensive strategy, since your opponent can never do better than 50% against it.  However, it is not the best offensive strategy if you can infer what your opponent will play.  For example, if you are confident that your opponent is too scared to play scissors for a third time in a row, exploit that and play paper (the only move vulnerable to scissor</p><p>3 0.089480609 <a title="68-tfidf-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-03-15-Feminists%2C_anarchists%2C_computational_complexity%2C_bounded_rationality%2C_nethack%2C_and_other_things_to_do.html">53 brendan oconnor ai-2007-03-15-Feminists, anarchists, computational complexity, bounded rationality, nethack, and other things to do</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was planning to write some  WordNet  lookup code tonight.  But instead I’ve learned of too many intersecting things.
 
First, there are a zillion things to do this weekend ( hooray flavorpill ):
 
  Picasso and American Art  exhibit continuing at  SFMOMA .  I saw it very briefly last weekend but want some more.  And Doug claims there’s an interesting photography exhibit there too.
  Reading from  We Don’t Need Another Wave: Dispatches from the Next Generation of Feminists , a fascinating looking book I’ve seen many times in the bookstores around here.  By that I mean at least Modern Times (the neat Mission bookstore) and the Anarchist Collective Bookstore (out on the Haight).  And the reading is at Modern Times,  just down the street  from my house!  Amazing.  Tomorrow at 7:30.
  Since anarchists were just mentioned, fortuitously there also appears: the  Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair  this Saturday and Sunday!  Speakers and books down by Golden Gate Park, oh my.

<p>Introduction: I got nervous and panicky just reading about this game.  I wonder if I could con some people into playing it.
  
Economics professors have a standard game they use to demonstrate how apparently rational decisions can create a disastrous result. They call it a “dollar auction.” The rules are simple. The professor offers a dollar for sale to the highest bidder, with only one wrinkle: the second-highest bidder has to pay up on their losing bid as well. Several students almost always get sucked in. The first bids a penny, looking to make 99 cents. The second bids 2 cents, the third 3 cents, and so on, each feeling they have a chance at something good on the cheap. The early stages are fun, and the bidders wonder what possessed the professor to be willing to lose some money.


The problem surfaces when the bidders get up close to a dollar. After 99 cents the last vestige of profitability disappears, but the bidding continues between the two highest players.

<p>Introduction: Contrary to  baseless speculation , it turns out it  is  possible to have a four-player, non-degenerate RPS game.  The game below is assymetrical: B does better than others, but you don’t want to play it all the time because that makes you vulnerable to A.  By contrast, D ain’t so hot.  But if you never play D, then your opponent can get away with A.  It’s uneven, but the optimal mixed strategy plays everything with non-zero probability.
 
     
 
Notation: the arrow from A to B means that A beats B.  Everyone ties themself.  No arrow indicates a tie.  There is a tie between A and C.  The  previous analysis  indicated there is no non-degenerate 4-RPS with no ties.  This has only 1 tie, so it seems to be the best possible.
 
(This game is just the  previous one  with the link from A to C removed.  This makes it so B no longer dominates C, since C is now invulnerable from A, unlike B.)</p><p>6 0.076692194 <a title="68-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-05-09-Simpson%E2%80%99s_paradox_is_so_totally_solved.html">60 brendan oconnor ai-2007-05-09-Simpson’s paradox is so totally solved</a></p>

This makes it so B no longer dominates C, since C is now invulnerable from A, unlike B.)</p><p>5 0.5337134 <a title="68-lsi-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2006/brendan_oconnor_ai-2006-06-03-Rock%2C_Paper%2C_Scissors.html">39 brendan oconnor ai-2006-06-03-Rock, Paper, Scissors</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pure game theory is debatably social science, so here goes.
 
    Inspired by various 5-, 7-, and even   25-move extensions  to Rock, Paper, Scissors, my friends and I were wondering whether it’s possible to have an even-move version.  It doesn’t seem possible, at least for 4-RPS.  I conjecture that all even-RPS’s might be similarly impossible.

<p>Introduction: I’m looking for recommendations for a good textbook/handbook/reference on (non-formal) linguistic semantics. Â My undergrad semantics course was almost entirely focused on logical/formal semantics, which is fine, but I don’t feel familiar with the breadth of substantive issues — for example, I’d be hard-pressed to explain why something like semantic/thematic role labeling should be useful for anything at all.
 
I somewhat randomly stumbled upon  Frawley 1992  ( review ) in a  used bookstore  and it seemed pretty good — in particular, it cleanly separates itself from the philosophical study of semantics, and thus identifies issues that seem amenable to computational modeling.
 
I’m wondering what else is out there? Â Here’s  a comparison of three textbooks .</p><p>2 0.93033457 <a title="68-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2013/brendan_oconnor_ai-2013-08-31-Probabilistic_interpretation_of_the_B3_coreference_resolution_metric.html">199 brendan oconnor ai-2013-08-31-Probabilistic interpretation of the B3 coreference resolution metric</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here is an intuitive justification for the  B3  evaluation metric often used in coreference resolution, based on whether mention pairs are coreferent. If a mention from the document is chosen at random,
  
 B3-Recall is the (expected) proportion of its actual coreferents that the system thinks are coreferent with it. 
 B3-Precision is the (expected) proportion of its system-hypothesized coreferents that are actually coreferent with it. 
  
Does this look correct to people? Details below:  
 
In B3′s basic form, it’s a clustering evaluation metric, to evaluate a gold-standard clustering of mentions against a system-produced clustering of mentions.
 
Let \(G\) mean a gold-standard entity and \(S\) mean a system-predicted entity, where an entity is a set of mentions. \(i\)Â refers to a mention; there are \(n\) mentions in the document. \(G_i\) means the gold entity that contains mention \(i\); and \(S_i\) means the system entity that has \(i\).

<p>Introduction: I think game theory could benefit immensely from better presentation.  Its default presentation is pretty mathematical.  This is good because it treats social interactions in an abstract way, highlighting their essential properties, but is bad because it’s hard to understand, especially at first.
 
However, I think I have a visualization that can sometimes capture the same abstract properties of the mathematics.  Here’s a stab at using it to explain everyone’s favorite game, the prisoner’s dilemma.
 
THE PD: Two players each choose whether to play nice, or be mean — Cooperate or Defect.  Then they simultaneously play their actions, and get payoffs depending on what both played.  If both cooperated, they help each other and do well; if both defect, they do quite poorly.  But if one tries to cooperate and the other defects, then the defector gets a big win, and the cooperator gets a crappy “sucker’s payoff”.
 
The formal PD definition looks like this:

<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: I haven’t done a paper review on this blog for a while, so here we go.
 
 Coreference  resolution is an interesting NLP problem.  ( Examples. )  It involves honest-to-goodness syntactic, semantic, and discourse phenomena, but still seems like a real cognitive task that humans have to solve when reading text [1].  I haven’t read the whole literature, but I’ve always been puzzled by the crop of papers on it I’ve seen in the last year or two.  There’s a big focus on fancy graph/probabilistic/constrained optimization algorithms, but often these papers gloss over the linguistic features — the core information they actually make their decisions with [2].  I never understood why the latter isn’t the most important issue.  Therefore, it was a joy to read
  
 Aria Haghighi and Dan Klein, EMNLP-2009.   “Simple Coreference Resolution with Rich Syntactic and Semantic Features.”

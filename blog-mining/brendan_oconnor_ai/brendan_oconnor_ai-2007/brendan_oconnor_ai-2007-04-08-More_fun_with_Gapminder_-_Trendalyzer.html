<p>Introduction: Will Fitzgerald just wrote about  an excellent  article by Steven Strogatz  on Zipf’s Law for the populations of cities.  If you look at the biggest city, then the next biggest city, etc., there tends to be an exponential fall-off in size.
 
I was wondering what this looks like so here’s the classic zipfian plot (log-size vs. log-rank) for city population data from from  populationdata.net :
 
   
 
If you fit a power law — that is, a line on the above logsize-logrank plot — you can use rank to predict the sizes of smaller cities very accurately, according to Will’s analysis.  Larger cities are more problematic, lying off the line.
 
I was curious whether the power law holds  within  countries as well.  The above plot was only for the countries that had more than 10 cities in the dataset — just eight countries.  So here are those same cities again, but plotted against ranks within their respective countries.

<p>Introduction: Sometimes it seems bad countries come with long names.  North Korea is “People’s Democratic Republic of Korea”, Libya is “Great Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya”, and the like.  But on the other hand, there’s plenty of counter-examples — it’s the “United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland” and “Republic of Cuba”, after all.  Do long names with good-sounding adjectives correspond with non-democratic governments?
 
Fortunately, this can be tested.  First, what words are out there?  From the  CIA Factbook’s  data on long form names, here are some of the most popular words used by today’s countries, listed with the number of occurrences across all 194 names.  I limited to tokens that appear >= 3 times.  A majority of countries are Republics, while there are some Kingdoms, and even a few Democracies.

<p>Introduction: Watching internet usage vs. income on the Gapminder.org visualizer is very interesting.
 
  
 
Several things are quite apparent.  (1) Internet usage exploded in all countries in the world.  (2) Richer countries have more internet usage (linear relationship on the scatterplot), but it’s been increasing in all countries regardless.
 
The animation has a few issues, of course — I think some of the funny, rapid movements at the very start are due to issues with when they started collecting reliable data on internet usage in the early 90′s, and the data probably started being more reliable at different times in different countries, etc.  
 
These are countervailing phenomena that require attention to variation within and across groups of data.  I can’t imagine pie charts or tables of numbers that could ever convey this level of nuance.
 
One last thing.  Going to the linear scale (so you can see differences in large amounts of internet use), watch South Korea vs. United States.

<p>Introduction: Will Fitzgerald just wrote about  an excellent  article by Steven Strogatz  on Zipf’s Law for the populations of cities.  If you look at the biggest city, then the next biggest city, etc., there tends to be an exponential fall-off in size.
 
I was wondering what this looks like so here’s the classic zipfian plot (log-size vs. log-rank) for city population data from from  populationdata.net :
 
   
 
If you fit a power law — that is, a line on the above logsize-logrank plot — you can use rank to predict the sizes of smaller cities very accurately, according to Will’s analysis.  Larger cities are more problematic, lying off the line.
 
I was curious whether the power law holds  within  countries as well.  The above plot was only for the countries that had more than 10 cities in the dataset — just eight countries.  So here are those same cities again, but plotted against ranks within their respective countries.
 
   
 
The answer is — usually, yes, the power law looks like it holds within</p><p>3 0.91840011 <a title="58-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-05-13-The_best_natural_language_search_commentary_on_the_internet.html">102 brendan oconnor ai-2008-05-13-The best natural language search commentary on the internet</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Freud Is Widely Taught at Universities, Except in the Psychology Department :
  
PSYCHOANALYSIS and its ideas about the unconscious mind have spread to every nook and cranny of the culture from Salinger to “South Park,” from Fellini to foreign policy. Yet if you want to learn about psychoanalysis at the nation’s top universities, one of the last places to look may be the psychology department.


A new report by the American Psychoanalytic Association has found that while psychoanalysis — or what purports to be psychoanalysis — is alive and well in literature, film, history and just about every other subject in the humanities, psychology departments and textbooks treat it as “desiccated and dead,” a historical artifact instead of “an ongoing movement and a living, evolving process.”
  
I’ve been wondering about this for a while, ever since I heard someone describe Freud as “one of the greatest humanists who ever lived.”  I’m pretty sure he didn’t think of himself that way.  If you’re a</p><p>5 0.1546164 <a title="58-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-08-13-It%E2%80%99s_all_in_a_name%3A_%22Kingdom_of_Norway%22_vs._%22Democratic_People%E2%80%99s_Republic_of_Korea%22.html">75 brendan oconnor ai-2007-08-13-It’s all in a name: "Kingdom of Norway" vs. "Democratic People’s Republic of Korea"</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sometimes it seems bad countries come with long names.  North Korea is “People’s Democratic Republic of Korea”, Libya is “Great Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya”, and the like.  But on the other hand, there’s plenty of counter-examples — it’s the “United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland” and “Republic of Cuba”, after all.  Do long names with good-sounding adjectives correspond with non-democratic governments?
 
Fortunately, this can be tested.  First, what words are out there?  From the  CIA Factbook’s  data on long form names, here are some of the most popular words used by today’s countries, listed with the number of occurrences across all 194 names.  I limited to tokens that appear >= 3 times.  A majority of countries are Republics, while there are some Kingdoms, and even a few Democracies.

</p><p>13 On one of his countless stops along the way, at an April 1984 meeting in Midland, Texas, he received word that a local oilman, the son of a prominent politician, wanted to see him privately. [sent-17, score-0.233]
</p><p>14 The businessman told Blessitt that he was not comfortable attending a public meeting but wanted to know Jesus better and learn how to follow him. [sent-18, score-0.38]

<p>Introduction: Standard problem: humans lived like crap for thousands and thousands of years, then suddenly some two hundred years ago dramatic industrialization and economic growth happened, though unevenly even through today.  Here’s  an interesting proposal  to explain all this.   Gregory Clark  found startling empirical evidence that, in the time around the Industrial Revolution in England, wealthier families had more children than poorer families, while middle-class social values — non-violence, literacy, work ethic, high savings rates — also became more widespread during this time.  According to the article at least, he actually seems to favor the explanation that human biological evolution was at work; though he notes cultural evolution is possible too.  (That is, the children of wealthier families are socialized with their values; as the children of middle-class-valued families increase in proportion in society, the prevalence of those values increases too.)

<p>Introduction: I was planning to write some  WordNet  lookup code tonight.  But instead I’ve learned of too many intersecting things.
 
First, there are a zillion things to do this weekend ( hooray flavorpill ):
 
  Picasso and American Art  exhibit continuing at  SFMOMA .  I saw it very briefly last weekend but want some more.  And Doug claims there’s an interesting photography exhibit there too.
  Reading from  We Don’t Need Another Wave: Dispatches from the Next Generation of Feminists , a fascinating looking book I’ve seen many times in the bookstores around here.  By that I mean at least Modern Times (the neat Mission bookstore) and the Anarchist Collective Bookstore (out on the Haight).  And the reading is at Modern Times,  just down the street  from my house!  Amazing.  Tomorrow at 7:30.
  Since anarchists were just mentioned, fortuitously there also appears: the  Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair  this Saturday and Sunday!  Speakers and books down by Golden Gate Park, oh my.

<p>Introduction: [Like medieval Christian societies,] Islamic societies similarly found ingenious ways to circumvent the usury ban.  The primary one was the  double sale .  In this transaction, the borrower would get, for example, both 100 dinars cash and a small piece of cloth valued at the absurdly high price of 15 dinars.  In a year he would have to pay back 100 dinars for the loan of the cash and 15 for the cloth.  These debts were upheld by Sharia courts.
  
The cognition of rules and ethics sure is complex.  I’d love to read the reasoning from those courts.
 
From from Gregory Clark’s  rather intense review  of  Avner Greif ‘s new-ish book on institutional economics.  (Clark’s the one who wrote that  interesting but weird  evolutionary argument about European economic development.)  If you’re in to the little worlds of institutional, evolutionary, and behavioral economics, Greif’s work is really interesting.

<p>Introduction: Just read an interesting analysis on the the simultaneous rise of the cultural left and right (“hippies and evangelicals”) through the 50′s and 60′s.   Brink Lindsey argues here  that they were both reactions to post-war material prosperity:
  
On the left gathered those who were most alive to the new possibilities created by the unprecedented mass affluence of the postwar years but at the same time were hostile to the social institutions — namely, the market and the middle-class work ethic — that created those possibilities. On the right rallied those who staunchly supported the institutions that created prosperity but who shrank from the social dynamism they were unleashing. One side denounced capitalism but gobbled its fruits; the other cursed the fruits while defending the system that bore them. Both causes were quixotic, and consequently neither fully realized its ambitions.
  
I love  neat sweeping theories of history ; I can’t take it overly seriously but it is so fun.

<p>Introduction: I was cleaning my office and found a back-of-envelope diagram  Shay  drew me once, so I’m writing it up to not forget.  The definitions of the  logistic-normal  and  log-normal  distributions are a little confusing with regard to their relationship to the normal distribution.  If you draw samples from one, the arrows below show the transformation to make it such you have samples from another.
 
   
 
For example, if  x ~ Normal , then transforming as  y=exp(x)  implies  y ~ LogNormal .  The adjective terminology is inverted: the logistic function goes from normal to logistic-normal, but the log function goes from log-normal to normal (other way!).  The log of the log-normal is normal, but it’s the   logit   of the logistic normal that’s normal.
 
Here are densities of these different distributions via transformations from a standard normal.
 
   In R:   x=rnorm(1e6); hist(x); hist(exp(x)/(1+exp(x)); hist(exp(x)) 
 
Just to make things more confusing, note the logistic-normal distributi</p><p>3 0.94425356 <a title="66-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2013/brendan_oconnor_ai-2013-04-16-Rise_and_fall_of_Dirichlet_process_clusters.html">194 brendan oconnor ai-2013-04-16-Rise and fall of Dirichlet process clusters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here’s Gibbs sampling for a  Dirichlet process 1-d mixture of Gaussians .  On 1000 data points that look like this.
 
   
 
I gave it fixed variance and a concentration and over MCMC iterations, and it looks like this.
 
   
 
The top is the number of points in a cluster.  The bottom are the cluster means.  Every cluster has a unique color.  During MCMC, clusters are created and destroyed.  Every cluster has a unique color; when a cluster dies, its color is never reused.  
 
I’m showing clusters every 100 iterations.  If there is a single point, that cluster was at that iteration but not before or after.  If there is a line, the cluster lived for at least 100 iterations.  Some clusters live long, some live short, but all eventually die.
 
Usually the model likes to think there are about two clusters, occupying positions at the two modes in the data distribution.  It also entertains the existence of several much more minor ones.  Usually these are shortlived clusters that die away.  But</p><p>4 0.89347816 <a title="66-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-03-21-Statistics_is_big-N_logic%3F.html">54 brendan oconnor ai-2007-03-21-Statistics is big-N logic?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I think I believe one of these things, but I’m not quite sure. 
 Statistics is just like logic, except with uncertainty. 
 
This would be true if statistics is Bayesian statistics and you buy the Bayesian inductive logic story — add induction to propositional logic, via a conditional credibility operator, and the Cox axioms imply standard probability theory as a consequence.  (That is, probability theory is logic with uncertainty.  And then a good Bayesian thinks probability theory and statistics are the same.)  Links:  Jaynes’ explanation ;  SEP article ; also  Fitelson’s article .  (Though there are negative results; all I can think of right now is a  Halpern  article on Cox; and also interesting is  Halpern and Koller .)
 
Secondly, here is another statement.
  

Statistics is just like logic, except with a big N.

  
This is a more data-driven view — the world is full of things and they need to be described.  Logical rules can help you describe things, but you also have to deal wit</p><p>5 0.54978436 <a title="66-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-01-30-%E2%80%9CLogic_Bomb%E2%80%9D.html">134 brendan oconnor ai-2009-01-30-“Logic Bomb”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Since blogging is hard, but reading is easy, lately I’ve taken to bookmarking interesting articles I’m reading, with the plan of blogging about them later.  This follow-through has happened a few times, but not that often.  In an amazing moment of thesis procrastination, today I sat down and figured out how to turn my  del.icio.us bookmarks  into a nice blogpost, with the plan that every week a post will appear with links I’ve recently read, or maybe I’ll use the script to generate a draft for myself that I’ll revise, or something.
 
But for this first such link post, I put in a whole bunch of them beyond just the last week — why have just a few when you could have *all* of them?  Future link posts will be shorter, I promise.

This absolultely makes sense to me as an economics research project, only because I’m used to thinking of economics from the view of multi-agent systems and game theory…  This is definitely all about game theory, maybe not economics.

<p>Introduction: Richard Rorty, philosopher, dies at 75 .
 
I’ve read enough of the analytic philosophers castigating Rorty — and taken bits of classes from a few of them — that I feel I just have to love the man.
 
I remember managing to see him speak twice.  Once was on philosophy of mind at the good ol’ Sym Sys Forum.   (Video!)   (“He is wrong, but wrong in such an interesting way!” I remember one comment.)
 
Most fascinating was when he gamely participated in a discussion at this very odd Christian thought conference some groups on campus put together.  (The Veritas Forum,  here’s a link .)  He was standing there, arguing with the Christian conservatives about the nature and legitimacy of authority, but humorously ceding ground where appropriate… “Look, it’s not that all children will be active critical thinkers and discover everything for themselves.  Getting a kid a secular liberal education isn’t that much different than any other education — you have to beat it in to them.”  (That is a paraphr</p><p>5 0.081011623 <a title="57-tfidf-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-06-25-1st_International_Conference_on_Computational_Models_of_Argument_%28COMMA06%29.html">5 brendan oconnor ai-2005-06-25-1st International Conference on Computational Models of Argument (COMMA06)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: does this look awesome or what? Imagine if you could computationally model the argumentation and communication in economic and political behavior. To say nothing of the AI applications too!
  
PRELIMINARY ANNOUNCEMENT 1st International Conference on Computational Models of Argument (COMMA06)


Organised by the ASPIC project (www.argumentation.org) The University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK 11th-12th September 2006 (provisional)


General Chair: Professor Michael J. Wooldridge Programme Chair: Paul E. Dunne


Over the past decade argumentation has become increasingly important in Artificial Intelligence. It has provided a fruitful way of approaching non-monotonic and defeasible reasoning, deliberation about action, and agent communication scenarios such as negotiation. In application domains such as law, medicine and e-democracy it has come to be seen as an essential part of the reasoning.


Successful workshops have been associated with major Artificial Intelligence Conferences, notabl</p><p>6 0.074860476 <a title="57-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2006/brendan_oconnor_ai-2006-07-20-neuroscience_and_economics_both_ways.html">41 brendan oconnor ai-2006-07-20-neuroscience and economics both ways</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I don’t care how lame anyone thinks this is, but economic theorist  Ariel Rubinstein  is the shit.  He’s funny, self-deprecating, and brilliant.  I was just re-reading  his delightful, sarcastic review of Freakonomics .  (Overly dramatized visual depiction below; hey, conflict sells.)
 
    The review consists of excerpts from his own upcoming super-worldwide-bestseller, “Freak-Freakonomics”.  It is full of golden quotes such as: 
  Chapter 2: Why do economists earn more than mathematicians?  
 
…
 
The comparison between architects and prostitutes can be applied to mathematicians and economists: The former are more skilled, highly educated and intelligent.  
 
To elaborate: 
 Levitt has never encountered a girl who dreams of being a prostitute and I have never met a child who dreams of being an economist. Like prostitutes, the skill required of economists is “not necessarily ‘specialized’” (106). And, finally, here is a new explanation for the salary gap between mathematicians and eco</p><p>4 0.40930742 <a title="57-lsi-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-09-02-Submit_your_poker_data%21.html">25 brendan oconnor ai-2005-09-02-Submit your poker data!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: From a graphics/mod programming workshop,  modifications of “Breakout”  in awesome video form:
 
          
 
It uses  Processing , a framework designed for animation and graphicky things.  It was also used for the  Similar Diversity  visualization that maps out named entities and their common verbs across religious texts.  It’s pretty cool:     … so a name gets bigger with its frequency, I get that; but what governs the size of an arc connecting two names?  They say “common activities” — I’m guessing a distance measure on the terms in the contexts in which they appear?  I’d be most interested in a graph of their explicit interactions; something like a count of co-occurrences in a proximity window (word radius? verse? chapter? book?) might do the trick…

<p>Introduction: Don’t have time to read much right now, but received word about a neat-looking paper:  Uncomputability: The Problem of Induction Internalized  by Kevin Kelly.
 
Kevin Kelly’s website has an awesome statement that mirrors thoughts I’ve been having for the last few years — the incredible importance of computational constraints applied to reasoning and rationality:
  
Kuhn teaches that a single, deep success suffices to keep a competing paradign on the table.  Not surprisingly, computational learning theory shows its superiority over ideal theories of rationality when we trade in our ideal agents for more realistic, computable agents.  The foundation of the deep success is a strong structural analogy between the halting problem and the problem of inductive generalization, allowing for a unified treatment of both, from the ground up.  One consequence of the approach is that one can often show that computable agents are forced to choose between ideal rationality and finding the right answer</p><p>3 0.82876098 <a title="57-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-05-23-Sub-reddit_for_Systems_Science_and_OR.html">104 brendan oconnor ai-2008-05-23-Sub-reddit for Systems Science and OR</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve been a big fan of Reddit’s  Programing  subsite for a while.  Just this morning I found another sub-reddit:  SYSOR: Systems Science, Operations Research and Everything In Between , and I’m loving it.  Lots of links on data mining, graph software, image recognition, learning theory, etc etc.
 
Not sure if the Operations Research part in the title is so big now — there’s some sort of complicated reorganization of a number of fields including operations research, systems science, computational learning, and more general computer science areas.  I’m a fan of the great historical overview in the Introduction in  Rusell and Norvig’s AI book ; I’m sure it’s slanted in various ways, but what else are overarching narratives for?  :)</p><p>4 0.72265375 <a title="57-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-04-05-Evil.html">56 brendan oconnor ai-2007-04-05-Evil</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I must be too cynical.  I thought I didn’t like  Philip Zimbardo ‘s theatrics, but regardless I really appreciated  this NYT interview  with him on the universal capacity for evil.     (S.P.E. is the  Stanford Prison Experiment , whose pictures here are from that lovely basement hallway, still there behind the 420-40 and 41 lecture rooms.)
 
In particular: 
 Q. What was your reaction when you first saw those photographs from Abu Ghraib? 
 
A. I was shocked. But not surprised. I immediately flashed on similar pictures from the S.P.E. What particularly bothered me was that the Pentagon blamed the whole thing on a “few bad apples.” I knew from our experiment, if you put good apples into a bad situation, you’ll get bad apples.
 
That was why I was willing to be an expert witness for Sgt. Chip Frederick, who was ultimately sentenced to eight years for his role at Abu Ghraib. Frederick was the Army reservist who was put in charge of the night shift at Tier 1A, where detainees were abused.

<p>Introduction: Sometimes it seems bad countries come with long names.  North Korea is “People’s Democratic Republic of Korea”, Libya is “Great Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya”, and the like.  But on the other hand, there’s plenty of counter-examples — it’s the “United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland” and “Republic of Cuba”, after all.  Do long names with good-sounding adjectives correspond with non-democratic governments?
 
Fortunately, this can be tested.  First, what words are out there?  From the  CIA Factbook’s  data on long form names, here are some of the most popular words used by today’s countries, listed with the number of occurrences across all 194 names.  I limited to tokens that appear >= 3 times.  A majority of countries are Republics, while there are some Kingdoms, and even a few Democracies.

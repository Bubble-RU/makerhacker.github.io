<p>Introduction: A much more slashing commentary from Slate:  
 An op-ed from Sunday’s New York Times, “This Is Your Brain on Politics,” proposes to answer what must be the most vexing question of modern American politics: What’s going on inside the head of a swing voter? The authorsâ€”a team of neuroscientists and political consultantsâ€”ran 20 of these undecided volunteers through a brain scanner and showed them pictures and video of the major candidates from both parties. The results, laid out both in print and an online slide show, purport to give us some insight as to how the upcoming primaries will play out: “Mitt Romney may have some potential,” the researchers conclude, and Hillary Clinton seems to have an edge at winning over her opponents.

<p>Introduction: There’s a company,  Emotiv , that’s building an  EEG  interface for the game systems.  Any company with a  science-fiction-y vision statement  sounds like a good time to me:
  
Communication between man and machine has always been limited to conscious interaction, with non-conscious communication — expression, intuition, perception — reserved solely for the human realm. At Emotiv, we believe that future communication between man and machine will not only be limited to the conscious communication that exists today, but non-conscious communication will play a significant part.


Our mission is to create the ultimate interface for the next-generation of man-machine interaction, by evolving the interaction between human beings and electronic devices beyond the limits of conscious interface. Emotiv is creating technologies that allow machines to take both conscious and non-conscious inputs directly from your mind.

<p>Introduction: A good anti-pop-cognitive-neuroscience rant  on Language Log: 
 In closing, there is a larger issue here, beyond the validity of a specific study of voter psychology. A number of different commercial ventures, from neuromarketing to brain-based lie detection, are banking on the scientific aura of brain imaging to bring them customers, in addition to whatever real information the imaging conveys. The fact that the UCLA study involved brain imaging will garner it more attention, and possibly more credibility among the general public, than if it had used only behavioral measures like questionnaires or people’s facial expressions as they watched the candidates. Because brain imaging is a more high tech approach, it also seems more “scientific” and perhaps even more ‘objective.” Of course, these last two terms do not necessarily apply. Depending on the way the output of UCLA’s multimillion dollar 3-Tesla scanner is interpreted, the result may be objective and scientific, or of no more value</p><p>2 0.94404566 <a title="82-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-06-17-Pairwise_comparisons_for_relevance_evaluation.html">106 brendan oconnor ai-2008-06-17-Pairwise comparisons for relevance evaluation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Not much on this blog lately, so I’ll repost a comment I just wrote on whether to use pairwise vs. absolute judgments for relevance quality evaluation.  (A fun one I know!)
 
From  this post on the Dolores Labs blog .
 
The paper being talked about is  Here or There: Preference Judgments for Relevance  by Carterette et al.
  
I skimmed through the Carterette paper and it’s interesting. My concern with pairwise setup is, in order to get comparability among query-result pairs, you need to get annotators to do an O(N^2) amount of work. (Unless you do something horribly complicated with partial orders.) The absolute judgment task scales linearly, of course. Given the AMT environment and a fixed budget, if I stay in the smaller-volume task, instead of spending a lot on a quadratic taskload, I can simply get a higher number of workers per result and boil out more noise. Of course, if it’s true the pairwise judgment task is easier — as the paper claims — that might make my spending more effic</p><p>3 0.92444837 <a title="82-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-10-17-Twitter_graphs_of_the_debate.html">121 brendan oconnor ai-2008-10-17-Twitter graphs of the debate</a></p>

<p>Introduction: What freely available end-to-end natural language processing (NLP) systems are out there, that start with raw text, and output parses and semantic structures?  Lots of NLP research focuses on single tasks at a time, and thus produces software that does a single task at a time.  But for various applications, it is nicer to have a full end-to-end system that just runs on whatever text you give it.
 
If you believe this is a worthwhile goal (see caveat at bottom), I will postulate there aren’t a ton of such end-to-end, multilevel systems.  Here are ones I can think of.  Corrections and clarifications welcome.
  
  Stanford CoreNLP .  Raw text to  rich syntactic dependencies  ( LFG -inspired).  Also POS, NER, coreference. 
  C&C; tools .  From (sentence-segmented, tokenized?) text to rich syntactic dependencies ( CCG -based) and also a semantic representation.  POS and chunks on the way.  Does anyone use this much?  It seems underappreciated relative to its richness.

<p>Introduction: There’s a lot to say about  Powerset , the short-lived natural language search company (2005-2008) where I worked after college.  AI overhype, flying too close to the sun, the psychology of tech journalism and venture capitalism, etc.  A year or two ago I wrote the following bit about Powerset’s technology in response to a question  on Quora .  I’m posting a revised version here.
 
 Question:  What was Powerset’s core innovation in search?  As far as I can tell, they licensed an NLP engine. They did not have a question answering system or any system for information extraction. How was Powerset’s search engine different than Google’s?
 
 My answer:  Powerset built a system vaguely like a question-answering system on top of Xerox PARC’s NLP engine.  The output is better described as query-focused summarization rather than question answering; primarily, it matched semantic fragments of the user query against indexed semantic relations, with lots of keyword/ngram-matching fallback for when</p><p>6 0.41496754 <a title="82-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-08-08-Haghighi_and_Klein_%282009%29%3A_Simple_Coreference_Resolution_with_Rich_Syntactic_and_Semantic_Features.html">150 brendan oconnor ai-2009-08-08-Haghighi and Klein (2009): Simple Coreference Resolution with Rich Syntactic and Semantic Features</a></p>

Everyone thinks, “but wait, RPS is a lame game.  Playing randomly is the best strategy!”  This is not true.  Playing randomly is the best defensive strategy, since your opponent can never do better than 50% against it.  However, it is not the best offensive strategy if you can infer what your opponent will play.  For example, if you are confident that your opponent is too scared to play scissors for a third time in a row, exploit that and play paper (the only move vulnerable to scissor</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 Rock, Paper, Scissors is making the blog rounds with an excellent strategy guide  from the World RPS Society  and a fun  mental floss article  too.

<p>Introduction: Contrary to  baseless speculation , it turns out it  is  possible to have a four-player, non-degenerate RPS game.  The game below is assymetrical: B does better than others, but you don’t want to play it all the time because that makes you vulnerable to A.  By contrast, D ain’t so hot.  But if you never play D, then your opponent can get away with A.  It’s uneven, but the optimal mixed strategy plays everything with non-zero probability.
 
     
 
Notation: the arrow from A to B means that A beats B.  Everyone ties themself.  No arrow indicates a tie.  There is a tie between A and C.  The  previous analysis  indicated there is no non-degenerate 4-RPS with no ties.  This has only 1 tie, so it seems to be the best possible.
 
(This game is just the  previous one  with the link from A to C removed.  This makes it so B no longer dominates C, since C is now invulnerable from A, unlike B.)</p><p>3 0.1883707 <a title="61-tfidf-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2006/brendan_oconnor_ai-2006-06-03-Rock%2C_Paper%2C_Scissors.html">39 brendan oconnor ai-2006-06-03-Rock, Paper, Scissors</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I think game theory could benefit immensely from better presentation.  Its default presentation is pretty mathematical.  This is good because it treats social interactions in an abstract way, highlighting their essential properties, but is bad because it’s hard to understand, especially at first.
 
However, I think I have a visualization that can sometimes capture the same abstract properties of the mathematics.  Here’s a stab at using it to explain everyone’s favorite game, the prisoner’s dilemma.
 
THE PD: Two players each choose whether to play nice, or be mean — Cooperate or Defect.  Then they simultaneously play their actions, and get payoffs depending on what both played.  If both cooperated, they help each other and do well; if both defect, they do quite poorly.  But if one tries to cooperate and the other defects, then the defector gets a big win, and the cooperator gets a crappy “sucker’s payoff”.
 
The formal PD definition looks like this:

<p>Introduction: I got nervous and panicky just reading about this game.  I wonder if I could con some people into playing it.
  
Economics professors have a standard game they use to demonstrate how apparently rational decisions can create a disastrous result. They call it a “dollar auction.” The rules are simple. The professor offers a dollar for sale to the highest bidder, with only one wrinkle: the second-highest bidder has to pay up on their losing bid as well. Several students almost always get sucked in. The first bids a penny, looking to make 99 cents. The second bids 2 cents, the third 3 cents, and so on, each feeling they have a chance at something good on the cheap. The early stages are fun, and the bidders wonder what possessed the professor to be willing to lose some money.


The problem surfaces when the bidders get up close to a dollar. After 99 cents the last vestige of profitability disappears, but the bidding continues between the two highest players. They now realize that they stand</p><p>6 0.055355959 <a title="61-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-11-15-Actually_that_2008_elections_voter_fMRI_study_is_batshit_insane_%28and_sleazy_too%29.html">83 brendan oconnor ai-2007-11-15-Actually that 2008 elections voter fMRI study is batshit insane (and sleazy too)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Upload your poker hand histories to  www.pokernomics.com , economist Stephen Levitt’s fringe-of-economics project to study what are effective strategies in poker.  This absolultely makes sense to me as an economics research project, only because I’m used to thinking of economics from the view of multi-agent systems and game theory…  This is definitely all about game theory, maybe not economics.  Game theory reaches beyond the bounds of the study of goods and services…

<p>Introduction: Rock, Paper, Scissors is making the blog rounds with an excellent strategy guide  from the World RPS Society  and a fun  mental floss article  too.  (Though the  First International RoShamBo programming contest  should be noted.)  Having played far too much RPS last year, I can say these tips look pretty decent for the most part.  I will say I am a huge fan of the elegant move Running With Scissors — scissors three times in a row.  “You think I’m crazy enough to play that AGAIN?”  Un-frickin-stoppable.
 
Everyone thinks, “but wait, RPS is a lame game.  Playing randomly is the best strategy!”  This is not true.  Playing randomly is the best defensive strategy, since your opponent can never do better than 50% against it.  However, it is not the best offensive strategy if you can infer what your opponent will play.  For example, if you are confident that your opponent is too scared to play scissors for a third time in a row, exploit that and play paper (the only move vulnerable to scissor</p><p>3 0.91775262 <a title="61-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-07-09-another_blog%3A_cog_psych_and_political-social_stuff.html">18 brendan oconnor ai-2005-07-09-another blog: cog psych and political-social stuff</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a good idea: in a search engine’s query logs, look for outbreaks of queries like [[flu symptoms]] in a given region.  I’ve heard (from  Roddy ) that this trick also works well on Facebook statuses (e.g. “Feeling crappy this morning, think I just got the flu”).
  
  Google Uses Web Searches to Track Flu’s Spread – NYTimes.com  
  Google Flu Trends – google.org  
  
For an example with a publicly available data feed, these queries works decently well on Twitter search:
 
 [[ flu -shot -google ]]  (high recall)
 
 [[ "muscle aches" flu -shot ]]  (high precision)
     
 
The “muscle aches” query is too sparse and the general query is too noisy, but you could imagine some more tricks to clean it up, then train a classifier, etc.  With a bit more work it looks like geolocation information can be had out of the  Twitter search API .</p><p>5 0.36932465 <a title="61-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2014/brendan_oconnor_ai-2014-02-19-What_the_ACL-2014_review_scores_mean.html">203 brendan oconnor ai-2014-02-19-What the ACL-2014 review scores mean</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve had several people ask me what the numbers in  ACL  reviews mean — and I can’t find anywhere online where they’re described.  (Can anyone point this out if it is somewhere?)
 
So here’s the review form, below.  They all go from 1 to 5, with 5 the best.  I think the review emails to authors only include a subset of the below — for example, “Overall Recommendation” is not included?
 
The CFP said that they have different types of review forms for different types of papers.  I think this one is for a standard full paper.  I guess what people  really  want to know is what scores tend to correspond to acceptances.  I really have no idea and I get the impression this can change year to year.  I have no involvement with the ACL conference besides being one of many, many reviewers.

Does the paper fit in ACL 2014? (Please answer this question in light of the desire to broaden the scope of the research areas represented at ACL.)

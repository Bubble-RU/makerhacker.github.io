<p>Introduction: We’re now live at a new location:  anyall.org/blog .  Good-bye, Blogger, it was sometimes nice knowing you.
 
This blog is now on WordPress (perhaps  behind the times ), which I’ve usually had good experiences with, e.g. for the  Dolores Labs Blog .  I also made the blog’s name more boring — the old one, “Social Science++”, was just too long and difficult to remember relative to how descriptive it was, and my interests have changed a little bit in any case.
 
All the old posts have been imported, and I  set up redirects  for all posts.  The RSS feed can’t be redirected though.
 
(One small issue: comment authors’ urls and emails failed to get imported.  I can fix it if I am given the info; if you want your old comments fixed, drop me a line.)</p><p>4 0.072397046 <a title="62-tfidf-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-12-03-Statistics_vs._Machine_Learning%2C_fight%21.html">129 brendan oconnor ai-2008-12-03-Statistics vs. Machine Learning, fight!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: What freely available end-to-end natural language processing (NLP) systems are out there, that start with raw text, and output parses and semantic structures?  Lots of NLP research focuses on single tasks at a time, and thus produces software that does a single task at a time.  But for various applications, it is nicer to have a full end-to-end system that just runs on whatever text you give it.
 
If you believe this is a worthwhile goal (see caveat at bottom), I will postulate there aren’t a ton of such end-to-end, multilevel systems.  Here are ones I can think of.  Corrections and clarifications welcome.
  
  Stanford CoreNLP .  Raw text to  rich syntactic dependencies  ( LFG -inspired).  Also POS, NER, coreference. 
  C&C; tools .  From (sentence-segmented, tokenized?) text to rich syntactic dependencies ( CCG -based) and also a semantic representation.  POS and chunks on the way.  Does anyone use this much?  It seems underappreciated relative to its richness.

<p>Introduction: This is off-topic for this blog but here goes.   ConnectU , a small college social networking site, has been in the news due to their  apparently weak lawsuit against Facebook , in which they claim  Mark Zuckerberg  stole their business plan and computer code back when they all were Harvard undergraduates.  (Judges involved have noted the case’s flimsy evidence; some technology commentators — as well as everyone I know — have noted that the business idea wasn’t all that brilliant or original in the first place.)  Zuckerberg, of course, went on to found Facebook and bring it to incredible success.
 
I tried to use the ConnectU site recently, but got an error when searching for a funny name with an apostrophe,  o’connor .

<p>Introduction: I don’t care how lame anyone thinks this is, but economic theorist  Ariel Rubinstein  is the shit.  He’s funny, self-deprecating, and brilliant.  I was just re-reading  his delightful, sarcastic review of Freakonomics .  (Overly dramatized visual depiction below; hey, conflict sells.)
 
    The review consists of excerpts from his own upcoming super-worldwide-bestseller, “Freak-Freakonomics”.  It is full of golden quotes such as: 
  Chapter 2: Why do economists earn more than mathematicians?  
 
…
 
The comparison between architects and prostitutes can be applied to mathematicians and economists: The former are more skilled, highly educated and intelligent.  
 
To elaborate: 
 Levitt has never encountered a girl who dreams of being a prostitute and I have never met a child who dreams of being an economist. Like prostitutes, the skill required of economists is “not necessarily ‘specialized’” (106). And, finally, here is a new explanation for the salary gap between mathematicians and eco</p><p>4 0.44532236 <a title="62-lsi-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-04-05-Evil.html">56 brendan oconnor ai-2007-04-05-Evil</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I must be too cynical.  I thought I didn’t like  Philip Zimbardo ‘s theatrics, but regardless I really appreciated  this NYT interview  with him on the universal capacity for evil.     (S.P.E. is the  Stanford Prison Experiment , whose pictures here are from that lovely basement hallway, still there behind the 420-40 and 41 lecture rooms.)
 
In particular: 
 Q. What was your reaction when you first saw those photographs from Abu Ghraib? 
 
A. I was shocked. But not surprised. I immediately flashed on similar pictures from the S.P.E. What particularly bothered me was that the Pentagon blamed the whole thing on a “few bad apples.” I knew from our experiment, if you put good apples into a bad situation, you’ll get bad apples.
 
That was why I was willing to be an expert witness for Sgt. Chip Frederick, who was ultimately sentenced to eight years for his role at Abu Ghraib. Frederick was the Army reservist who was put in charge of the night shift at Tier 1A, where detainees were abused.

<p>Introduction: It’s been a good year.  Last fall I started a master’s program in the Language Technologies department at  CMU SCS , taking some great classes, hanging out with a  cool lab , and writing two new papers (for  ICWSM , involving Twitter:  polls  and  tweetmotif ; also did some  coref  work, financial text regression stuff, and looked at  social lexicography .)  I also applied to CS and stats PhD programs at several universities.  Next year I’ll be starting the PhD program in the  Machine Learning Department  here at CMU.
 
I’m excited!  Just the other day I was looking at videos on my old hard drive and found a presentation by  Tom Mitchell  on “the Discipline of Machine Learning” that I downloaded back in 2007 or so.

<p>Introduction: With my friend  Doug , I just finished making a game —   PalinSpeak.com   —  where you can chat with a Sarah Palin simulator.  Check it out, it’s the best thing to hit the Internet since sliced bread.

<p>Introduction: Like everyone, I’ve been just starting to look at the new, tentative,  proof that P != NP  from Vinay Deolalikar.  After reading the intro, what’s most striking is that probabilistic graphical models and mathematical logic are at the core of the proof.  This feels like a machine learning and artificial intelligence-centric approach to me — very different from what you usually see in mainstream CS theory.  (Maybe I should feel good that in my undergrad I basically stopped studying normal math and spent all my time with this weird stuff instead!)
 
He devotes several chapters to an introduction to graphical models — Ising models, conditional independence, MRF’s, Hammersley-Clifford, and all that other stuff you see in  Koller and Friedman  or something — and then logic and model theory!  I’m impressed.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.97685945 <a title="62-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-05-29-%22Stanford_Impostor%22.html">62 brendan oconnor ai-2007-05-29-"Stanford Impostor"</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve gotten a zillion emails about it by now, but it was recently found that a young woman had been living for a year in Stanford dorms claiming to be a freshman, when in fact she was not a student of any sort at all.  This seems to have engendered much discussion in the Stanford community, e.g.  here .  (The  LA Times  has a decent piece).
 
I mostly think the story is just sad, but a few thoughts:
 
 The security scare angle is a bit ridiculous, as is the blame game being played.
  I suspect the Stanford community is naive and high-strung about these things.  My friends who went to state schools say things like this happen all the time.  Besides, staffs in co-ops are sometimes happy to let vagrants hang out.  The motivations for and mechanics of her deception are clearly the important part of this story (e.g.  how did she live with herself? )
  Her first two quarters were in Kimball, then then her last quarter was in Okada.  I’m surprised the Kimball staff weren’t enough in-touch wit</p><p>4 0.88018078 <a title="62-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-03-24-Quick-R%2C_the_only_decent_R_documentation_on_the_internet.html">97 brendan oconnor ai-2008-03-24-Quick-R, the only decent R documentation on the internet</a></p>

I really love R, but it has horrid documentation and a steep learning curve.  Recently I was introduced to  Quick-R , a really excellent documentation site.

<p>Introduction: It’s been a good year.  Last fall I started a master’s program in the Language Technologies department at  CMU SCS , taking some great classes, hanging out with a  cool lab , and writing two new papers (for  ICWSM , involving Twitter:  polls  and  tweetmotif ; also did some  coref  work, financial text regression stuff, and looked at  social lexicography .)  I also applied to CS and stats PhD programs at several universities.  Next year I’ll be starting the PhD program in the  Machine Learning Department  here at CMU.
 
I’m excited!  Just the other day I was looking at videos on my old hard drive and found a presentation by  Tom Mitchell  on “the Discipline of Machine Learning” that I downloaded back in 2007 or so.  (Can’t find it online right now, but  this is similar .)  That might be where I heard of the department first.  Maybe some day I will be smarter than the guy who wrote  this rant  (though I am much more pro-stats and anti-ML these days…).

<p>Introduction: Richard Rorty, philosopher, dies at 75 .
 
I’ve read enough of the analytic philosophers castigating Rorty — and taken bits of classes from a few of them — that I feel I just have to love the man.
 
I remember managing to see him speak twice.  Once was on philosophy of mind at the good ol’ Sym Sys Forum.   (Video!)   (“He is wrong, but wrong in such an interesting way!” I remember one comment.)
 
Most fascinating was when he gamely participated in a discussion at this very odd Christian thought conference some groups on campus put together.  (The Veritas Forum,  here’s a link .)  He was standing there, arguing with the Christian conservatives about the nature and legitimacy of authority, but humorously ceding ground where appropriate… “Look, it’s not that all children will be active critical thinkers and discover everything for themselves.  Getting a kid a secular liberal education isn’t that much different than any other education — you have to beat it in to them.”  (That is a paraphr</p><p>3 0.074306026 <a title="87-tfidf-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-10-13-Verificationism_dinosaur_comics.html">79 brendan oconnor ai-2007-10-13-Verificationism dinosaur comics</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I must be too cynical.  I thought I didn’t like  Philip Zimbardo ‘s theatrics, but regardless I really appreciated  this NYT interview  with him on the universal capacity for evil.     (S.P.E. is the  Stanford Prison Experiment , whose pictures here are from that lovely basement hallway, still there behind the 420-40 and 41 lecture rooms.)
 
In particular: 
 Q. What was your reaction when you first saw those photographs from Abu Ghraib? 
 
A. I was shocked. But not surprised. I immediately flashed on similar pictures from the S.P.E. What particularly bothered me was that the Pentagon blamed the whole thing on a “few bad apples.” I knew from our experiment, if you put good apples into a bad situation, you’ll get bad apples.
 
That was why I was willing to be an expert witness for Sgt. Chip Frederick, who was ultimately sentenced to eight years for his role at Abu Ghraib. Frederick was the Army reservist who was put in charge of the night shift at Tier 1A, where detainees were abused.

<p>Introduction: An two-step explanation for distrust of science: (1) journalists write up poor science or take out the evidence and information from a scientific study, then (2) people read that and criticize science for being unfounded, arbitrary, etc.   Link .  Some fun quotes:   
 Statistics are what causes the most fear for reporters, and so they are usually just edited out, with interesting consequences. Because science isn’t about something being true or not true: that’s a humanities graduate parody. It’s about the error bar, statistical significance, it’s about how reliable and valid the experiment was, it’s about coming to a verdict, about a hypothesis, on the back of lots of bits of evidence.  
 
 and   
 
  So how do the media work around their inability to deliver scientific evidence? They use authority figures, the very antithesis of what science is about, as if they were priests, or politicians, or parent figures. “Scientists today said … scientists revealed … scientists warned.” And if t</p><p>6 0.055272952 <a title="87-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-06-25-zombies%21.html">9 brendan oconnor ai-2005-06-25-zombies!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In 1994, the Rwandan genocide claimed 800,000 lives.  This genocide was remarkable for being very low-tech — lots of non-military, average people with machetes killing their neighbors.  Romeo Dallaire, the leader of the small UN peacekeeping mission there, saw it coming and was convinced he could stop much of the violence if he had 5,000 international troops plus the authority to seize weapon caches and do other aggressive intervention operations.  Famously,  he made a plea to his superiors and was denied .  (The genocide ended only when a rebel army managed a string of military victories and forcibly stopped the killing.)

<p>Introduction: Either God is tricky, or maybe probability is.
 
Pascal’s Wager: Say there’s only a small chance God exists.  If you are an atheist but God does actually exist, He will send you to hell for eternity.  This is infinitely bad.  Therefore you should believe in God on the off-chance he does exist, since a small chance of something infinitely bad is worse than the alternative.
 
 Believe in Pascal’s Wager?  Have I got a deal for you!  says if you believe it, you should send Alex Tabarrok money because he will put in a good word to God for you.  Hey, there’s a small chance he has a direct line to God, which yields infinite utility (or avoids hell’s infinite disutility).
 
FWIW, I’m thinking the paradoxes in this sort of arithmetic always happen when you start doing addition/multiplication distribution across those darn infinities.  Like on the third page Tabarrok starts talking about p1*Inf – p2*Inf = (p1-p2)*Inf.  That’s shady shit.

<p>Introduction: I thought  Eurovision  was weird enough already.  But in addition to the usual fun mix of kitschy pop and Cold War legacy nationalism in its telephone voting politics, this year will see Finland’s satanic band Lordi: 
 HELSINKI, Finland â€” They have eight-foot retractable latex Satan wings, sing hits like “Chainsaw Buffet” and blow up slabs of smoking meat on stage. So members of the band Lordi expected a reaction when they beat a crooner of love ballads to represent Finland at the Eurovision song contest in Athens, the competition that was the springboard for Abba and Celine Dion. 
 
    
 “In Finland, we have no Eiffel Tower, few real famous artists, it is freezing cold and we suffer from low self-esteem,” said Mr. Putaansuu, who, as Lordi, has horns protruding from his forehead and sports long black fingernails. 
 
As he stuck out his tongue menacingly, his red demon eyes glaring, Lordi was surrounded by Kita, an alien-man-beast predator who plays flame-spitting drums inside a cage</p><p>same-blog 3 0.8969872 <a title="87-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-12-26-What_is_experimental_philosophy%3F.html">87 brendan oconnor ai-2007-12-26-What is experimental philosophy?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Experimental philosophy:  
 Suppose the chairman of a company has to decide whether to adopt a new program. It would increase profits and help the environment too. “I don’t care at all about helping the environment,” the chairman says. “I just want to make as much profit as I can. Let’s start the new program.” Would you say that the chairman intended to help the environment? 
 
O.K., same circumstance. Except this time the program would harm the environment. The chairman, who still couldn’t care less about the environment, authorizes the program in order to get those profits. As expected, the bottom line goes up, the environment goes down. Would you say the chairman harmed the environment intentionally?
 
in one survey, only 23 percent of people said that the chairman in the first situation had intentionally helped the environment. When they had to think about the second situation, though, fully 82 percent thought that the chairman had intentionally harmed the environment. There’s plen</p><p>4 0.3094328 <a title="87-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-11-12-Disease_tracking_with_web_queries_and_social_messaging_%28Google%2C_Twitter%2C_Facebook%E2%80%A6%29.html">123 brendan oconnor ai-2008-11-12-Disease tracking with web queries and social messaging (Google, Twitter, Facebook…)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a good idea: in a search engine’s query logs, look for outbreaks of queries like [[flu symptoms]] in a given region.  I’ve heard (from  Roddy ) that this trick also works well on Facebook statuses (e.g. “Feeling crappy this morning, think I just got the flu”).
  
  Google Uses Web Searches to Track Flu’s Spread – NYTimes.com  
  Google Flu Trends – google.org  
  
For an example with a publicly available data feed, these queries works decently well on Twitter search:
 
 [[ flu -shot -google ]]  (high recall)
 
 [[ "muscle aches" flu -shot ]]  (high precision)
     
 
The “muscle aches” query is too sparse and the general query is too noisy, but you could imagine some more tricks to clean it up, then train a classifier, etc.  With a bit more work it looks like geolocation information can be had out of the  Twitter search API .</p><p>5 0.30404717 <a title="87-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2014/brendan_oconnor_ai-2014-02-19-What_the_ACL-2014_review_scores_mean.html">203 brendan oconnor ai-2014-02-19-What the ACL-2014 review scores mean</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve had several people ask me what the numbers in  ACL  reviews mean — and I can’t find anywhere online where they’re described.  (Can anyone point this out if it is somewhere?)
 
So here’s the review form, below.  They all go from 1 to 5, with 5 the best.  I think the review emails to authors only include a subset of the below — for example, “Overall Recommendation” is not included?
 
The CFP said that they have different types of review forms for different types of papers.  I think this one is for a standard full paper.  I guess what people  really  want to know is what scores tend to correspond to acceptances.  I really have no idea and I get the impression this can change year to year.  I have no involvement with the ACL conference besides being one of many, many reviewers.

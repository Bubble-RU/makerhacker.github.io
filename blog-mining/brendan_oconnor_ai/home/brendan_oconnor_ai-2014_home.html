<p>Introduction: Here’s a re-plotting of a graph in  this 538 post .  It’s looking at whether pilots speed up the flight when there’s a delay, and find that it looks like that’s the case.  This is averaged data for flights on several major transcontinental routes.
 
I’ve replotted the main graph as follows.  The x-axis is departure delay.  The y-axis is the total trip time — number of minutes since the scheduled departure time.  For an on-time departure, the average flight is 5 hours, 44 minutes.  The blue line shows what the total trip time would be if the delayed flight took that long.  Gray lines are uncertainty (I think the CI due to averaging).
 
   
 
What’s going on is, the pilots seem to be targeting a total trip time of 370-380 minutes or so.  If the departure is only slightly delayed by 10 minutes, the flight time is still the same, but delays in the 30-50 minutes range see a faster flight time which makes up for some of the delay.
 
The original post plotted the y-axis as the delta against t</p><p>2 <a title="brendan_oconnor_ai-2014-203" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2014/brendan_oconnor_ai-2014-02-19-What_the_ACL-2014_review_scores_mean.html">brendan oconnor ai-2014-02-19-What the ACL-2014 review scores mean</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve had several people ask me what the numbers in  ACL  reviews mean — and I can’t find anywhere online where they’re described.  (Can anyone point this out if it is somewhere?)
 
So here’s the review form, below.  They all go from 1 to 5, with 5 the best.  I think the review emails to authors only include a subset of the below — for example, “Overall Recommendation” is not included?
 
The CFP said that they have different types of review forms for different types of papers.  I think this one is for a standard full paper.  I guess what people  really  want to know is what scores tend to correspond to acceptances.  I really have no idea and I get the impression this can change year to year.  I have no involvement with the ACL conference besides being one of many, many reviewers.
 
  
  
APPROPRIATENESS (1-5)
Does the paper fit in ACL 2014? (Please answer this question in light of the desire to broaden the scope of the research areas represented at ACL.) 

5: Certainly.

<p>Introduction: I should make a blog where all I do is scatterplot results tables from papers.  I do this once in a while to make them eaiser to understand…
 
I think the following are results are from Yee Whye Teh’s paper on hierarchical Pitman-Yor language models, and in particular comparing them to Kneser-Ney and hierarchical Dirichlets.  They’re specifically from  these slides by Yee Whye Teh (page 25) , which shows model perplexities.  Every dot is for one experimental condition, which has four different results from each of the models.  So a pair of models can be compared in one scatterplot.
 
   
 
where
  
   ikn = interpolated kneser-ney
    mkn = modified kneser-ney
    hdlm = hierarchical dirichlet
    hpylm = hierarchical pitman-yor
   
My reading: the KN’s and HPYLM are incredibly similar (as Teh argues should be the case on theoretical grounds).  MKN and HPYLM edge out IKN.  HDLM is markedly worse (this is perplexity, so lower is better).  While HDLM is a lot worse, it does best, relativ</p><br/><br/><br/>

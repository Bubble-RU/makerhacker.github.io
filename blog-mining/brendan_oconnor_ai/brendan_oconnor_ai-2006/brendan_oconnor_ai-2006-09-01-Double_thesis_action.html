Against left-handed pitchers, Player A has a higher batting average than Player B.  Player A does better against right-handed pitchers also.


Is it possible that B has a better average than A?

  
Here’s a beautiful ASCII art visualization that says Yes.
 
Each star represents a number of at-bats where the player hit; pluses represent misses.  If you put them in a horizontal line you can see the batting averages (proportions) pretty clearly.  The bar lenghts carry across rows — so a longer bar means more at-bats.
  
Against left-handed pitchers:
A hits |**--| A misses    --> 50% avg.
B hits |*---| B misses    --> 25% avg.

Against right-handed pitchers:
A hits |**|              A misses    --> 100% avg.
B hits |**************-| B misses    -->  93% avg.  (for many more at-bats!)

<p>Introduction: A common cognitive science view (H. Simon): Heuristics/biases are useful rules-of-thumb to approximate optimizing behavior given computational constraints.
 
Consider the chess-playing heuristic “try not to lose your queen”.  Since you can’t analyze all possible chess moves, it’s nice to have such a rule-of-thumb to narrow down possible actions to consider.  You can reject out of hand an action that leads to losing your queen.  This heuristic helps to approximate optimal chess-playing behavior given your computational constraints.
 
Similarly, moral rules, tendencies, associations, and ontologies are heuristics to approximate socially optimal behavior. “Lying is bad” is a useful rule-of-thumb that usually gets good results for society. Codifying it as a norm — meaning, there’s 3rd party punishment and/or self-punishment (guilt) when it’s violated, thus the rule should get obeyed — is the implementation of a social-level heuristic that generally gives useful behavior.

<p>Introduction: These are both useful summaries.  Slate has a  chart of relationships  between Hamas, Hezbollah, Israel, and Lebanon, versus a number of different actors in the region.  NYTimes has  something similar on a map , also showing the sizes of ethnic/religious groups.  Seems the NYTimes is most interesting as far as visualization/graphic design goes.  It also has rich relational information and lots of predicates: does group X have oil wealth?  is group X in the government of country Y?  Etc.  Seems ripe for a  relational concept-learning clustering analysisâ&euro;Ś

<p>Introduction: Earlier this year, it turned out that  humans socially evolved cooperation through group competition and conflict .  And now, it seems that  biased evidence assimilation can happen through bounded rationality .

<p>Introduction: Cool visualization of agreement levels among Supreme Court justices .  I like how they’re ordered so that the smallest amount of agreement ends up in the lower-left.  Hopefully it’s not deceptive for certain cases: I imagine that summarizing their tendencies to vote certain ways into a one dimensional spectrum would lose important information of other dimensions of agreement or coalitions.</p><p>3 0.83464098 <a title="45-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-08-12-Beautiful_Data_book_chapter.html">151 brendan oconnor ai-2009-08-12-Beautiful Data book chapter</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Today I received my copy of  Beautiful Data , a just-released anthology of articles about, well, working with data.   Lukas  and I contributed a chapter on analyzing social perceptions in web data.   See it here.  After a long process of drafting, proofreading, re-drafting, and bothering the publishers under rather sudden deadlines, I’ve resolved to never use graphics again in anything I write :)
 
Here’s our final figure, a  k-means  clustering of face photos via perceived social attributes (social  concepts/types ? with  exemplars ?): 
   
 
I just started reading the rest of the book and it’s very fun.   Peter Norvig ‘s chapter on language models is gripping.  (It does word segmentation, ciphers, and more, in that lovely python-centric tutorial style extending his previous  spell correction article .)  There are also chapters by many other great researchers and practitioners (some of whom you may have seen around this blog or its neighborhood) like  Andrew Gelman ,  Hadley Wickham ,</p><p>4 0.074111342 <a title="45-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-05-09-Simpson%E2%80%99s_paradox_is_so_totally_solved.html">60 brendan oconnor ai-2007-05-09-Simpson’s paradox is so totally solved</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My friend Lukas just wrote a great formulation of  Simpson’s Paradox as a puzzle :
  

Against left-handed pitchers, Player A has a higher batting average than Player B.  Player A does better against right-handed pitchers also.


Is it possible that B has a better average than A?

  
Here’s a beautiful ASCII art visualization that says Yes.
 
Each star represents a number of at-bats where the player hit; pluses represent misses.  If you put them in a horizontal line you can see the batting averages (proportions) pretty clearly.  The bar lenghts carry across rows — so a longer bar means more at-bats.
  
Against left-handed pitchers:
A hits |**--| A misses    --> 50% avg.
B hits |*---| B misses    --> 25% avg.

Against right-handed pitchers:
A hits |**|              A misses    --> 100% avg.
B hits |**************-| B misses    -->  93% avg.  (for many more at-bats!)

But, batting against *ALL* pitchers:
A hits  |****--| A misses                 --> 66% avg.
B hits  |*********</p><p>5 0.068846636 <a title="45-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-08-16-A_better_Obama_vs_McCain_poll_aggregation.html">111 brendan oconnor ai-2008-08-16-A better Obama vs McCain poll aggregation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:  Charles Franklin (of Pollster.com) kindly emailed me with many interesting points on this post.  One important note is that my technique isn’t really “no smoothing” — rather, there is now implicit smoothing within the polling houses, by assuming that responses are evenly distributed across the time interval of the poll.
   I was looking at Pollster.com’s page that aggregates many opinion polls on the Presidential race.    Here, they have a chart   that shows the many polls plus lowess fits: 
   
 
So there’s a trend of Obama recently declining.  But it wasn’t clear to me that the fitted curve was correct.  I downloaded the data and started playing around with it.
 
Here are several more graphs I made, with different smoothing parameters for the lowess fit.  Your interpretation completely changes depending which smoothing parameter you like best!
 
   
 
Well, maybe this is an argument to use rolling averages over a fixed number of days or something.  But it would be nice to di</p><p>6 0.054745849 <a title="45-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-07-08-Game_outcome_graphs_%E2%80%94_prisoner%E2%80%99s_dilemma_with_FUN_ARROWS%21%21%21.html">68 brendan oconnor ai-2007-07-08-Game outcome graphs — prisoner’s dilemma with FUN ARROWS!!!</a></p>

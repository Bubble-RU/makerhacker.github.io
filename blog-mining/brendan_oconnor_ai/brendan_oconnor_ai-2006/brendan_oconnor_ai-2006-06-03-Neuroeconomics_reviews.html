<p>Introduction: I previously  posted  two neuroeconomics reviews.   Here’s a new one from this year  in Trends in Cognitive Sciences.  It’s interesting because not only does it look at using psychological knowledge to inform economics, but it also reviews work in the other direction: using economic decision and organizational theory to study brain systems.  For example,   here’s a paper  that analyzes brain reward circuitry using labor supply theory.

<p>Introduction: I saw  Seth Roberts  briefly speak today (at an  odd event ) about self-experimentation.  He tried drinking flavorless sugar water and it led him to lose lots of weight.  He also did a great variety of other self-experiments over more than a decade,  written up here  (and IMHO the other ones are much more interesting).
 
I briefly spoke to him there and told him I heard about his work from  Andrew Gelman’s blog .  He seemed surprised to (semi-)randomly meet someone who reads it.  I think this is mistaken — that particular blog seems quite popular in statistics/social science world.  In fact, Gelman’s blogging of Roberts’ self-experimentation paper got picked up by the Freakonomics folks and it became a sensation and then a book deal.  ( Story. )
 
Also note, John Langford says of his own  machine learning blog : 
 This blog currently receives about 3K unique visitors per day from about 13K unique sites per month. This number of visitors is large enough that it scares me somewhatâ€”havi</p><p>4 0.10053818 <a title="38-tfidf-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-06-25-looking_for_related_blogs-links.html">7 brendan oconnor ai-2005-06-25-looking for related blogs-links</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What are good other resources on the internet for social science, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence (or computation more generally)? I’m looking for blog-like things in particular — stay updated on new research and the like.
 
here’s the list so far, trying to be interdisciplinary as possible. A cognitive neuroscience or neuroeconomics blog would be a nice addition.

<p>Introduction: Absolutely amazing — a  short film  chronicling conflicts from World War II — as food.
 
  
 
I think this has to have the highest amount of Wikipedia-linkable references per second of any film I’ve seen.  Yes, it’s U.S.-centric, but so is Wikipedia, which makes cataloguing it easier.  At the very least:
 
  World War II 
 
  Persecution of Jews  and  The Holocaust  
  Invasion of France  
  The Blitz  
  Pearl Harbor ,  Pacific Theater  
  D-Day  
  Liberation of France  Invasion of Germany –  Western  and  Eastern  fronts 
  Atomic bombing of Hiroshima  
 
 
  1948 Arab-Israeli War  
  Korean War  
  Cuban Missile Crisis  
  Vietnam War 
 
  French Indochina War  
  U.S. involvement  
 
 
  US/USSR nuclear arms race  
  First Gulf War  
   
  Invasion of Kuwait  
 
   Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
 
 Judging from its timing in the film, maybe specifically the  First Intifada ? 
 
 
  9/11 attacks  
  War in Afghanistan 
 
 Taliban falls, but  some escape , with  Osama bin Laden</p><p>4 0.45899296 <a title="38-lsi-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-07-04-freakonomics_blog.html">15 brendan oconnor ai-2005-07-04-freakonomics blog</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here are two great reviews, from 2003 then 2005.
 
1)  PLoS Biology: Economy of the Mind  nicely reviews the field and many interesting experiments.
 
One annoyance: They need to say “Banburismus” is more commonly known as Bayesian learning.  (Banbury, England was a city near Bletchley Park they got their paper from when doing Bayesian statistical codebreaking of the Enigma cipher in World War II.   Read the story here  in MacKay’s excellent free online  textbook .)   Thanks to  neurodudes  for the PLoS link.
 
2)  Neuroeconomics: How neuroscience can inform economics  is written by the leaders of the field, advocating their approach.  I like the detail and their careful descriptions of how cognitive neuroscience findings can enhance our understanding of economic phenomena.
 
Also, the second is useful to read since it’s the target of criticism by the more recent  The case for mindless economics , which I view as an empire-strikes-back sort of paper.

<p>Introduction: Herbert Gintis thinks  it’s time to unify the behavioral sciences. Sociology, economics, political science, human biology, anthropology and others all study the same thing, but each is based on different incompatible models of individual human behavior. There seems to be evidence that new developments have the potential to offer a more unifying theory. Evolutionary biology should be the basis of understanding much of human behavior. Rational choice and game theoretic frameworks are finding greater acceptance beyond economics; in the meantime, other fields need to absorb sociology’s emphasis on socialization — that people do things or understand the world in a way taught by society. The human behavioral sciences are still rife with many smaller inconsistencies; for example, according to Gintis, only anthropolgists look at the influence of culture across groups, but only sociologists look at culture within groups.
 
Gintis’ ultimate goal is to have a common baseline from which each disci</p><p>3 0.21557799 <a title="38-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2006/brendan_oconnor_ai-2006-07-20-neuroscience_and_economics_both_ways.html">41 brendan oconnor ai-2006-07-20-neuroscience and economics both ways</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I previously  posted  two neuroeconomics reviews.   Here’s a new one from this year  in Trends in Cognitive Sciences.  It’s interesting because not only does it look at using psychological knowledge to inform economics, but it also reviews work in the other direction: using economic decision and organizational theory to study brain systems.  For example,   here’s a paper  that analyzes brain reward circuitry using labor supply theory.
 
The review:  Sanfey, Loewenstein, McClure, Cohen: “Neuroeconomics: cross-currents in research on decision-making”</p><p>4 0.21149173 <a title="38-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2013/brendan_oconnor_ai-2013-02-23-Wasserman_on_Stats_vs_ML%2C_and_previous_comparisons.html">191 brendan oconnor ai-2013-02-23-Wasserman on Stats vs ML, and previous comparisons</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Larry Wasserman has a new position paper (forthcoming 2013) with a great comparison the Statistics and Machine Learning research cultures,  “Rise of the Machines” .  He has a very conciliatory view in terms of intellectual content, and a very pro-ML take on the research cultures.  Central to his argument is that ML has recently adopted rigorous statistical concepts, and the fast-moving conference culture (and heavy publishing by its grad students) have helped with this and other good innovations.  (I agree with a comment from Sinead that he’s going a little easy on ML, but it’s certainly worth a read.)
 
There’s now a little history of “Statistics vs Machine Learning” position papers that this can be compared to.  A classic is Leo Breiman (2001),  “Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures” , which isn’t exactly about stats vs. ML, but is about the focus on modeling vs algorithms, and maybe about description vs. prediction.

<p>Introduction: Experimental philosophy:  
 Suppose the chairman of a company has to decide whether to adopt a new program. It would increase profits and help the environment too. “I don’t care at all about helping the environment,” the chairman says. “I just want to make as much profit as I can. Let’s start the new program.” Would you say that the chairman intended to help the environment? 
 
O.K., same circumstance. Except this time the program would harm the environment. The chairman, who still couldn’t care less about the environment, authorizes the program in order to get those profits. As expected, the bottom line goes up, the environment goes down. Would you say the chairman harmed the environment intentionally?
 
in one survey, only 23 percent of people said that the chairman in the first situation had intentionally helped the environment. When they had to think about the second situation, though, fully 82 percent thought that the chairman had intentionally harmed the environment.

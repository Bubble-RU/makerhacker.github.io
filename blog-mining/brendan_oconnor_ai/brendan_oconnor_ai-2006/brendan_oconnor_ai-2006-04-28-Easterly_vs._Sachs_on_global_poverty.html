<p>Introduction: There’s a lot of exciting work in moral psychology right now.  I’ve been telling various poor fools who listen to me to read something from  Jonathan Haidt  or  Joshua Greene , but of course there’s a sea of too many articles and books of varying quality and intended audience.

I recommend it highly, if just for presenting so many awesome examples.  (Yes, this blog has  poked fun  at Pinker before.  But in any case, he is a brilliant expository writer.   The Language Instinct  is still one of my favorite popular science books.)

Volatility frequently occurs when everyone suddenly realizes the stock market is just a consensual mass delusion based on fictitious valuings of abstract assets.

<p>Introduction: A much more slashing commentary from Slate:  
 An op-ed from Sunday’s New York Times, “This Is Your Brain on Politics,” proposes to answer what must be the most vexing question of modern American politics: What’s going on inside the head of a swing voter? The authorsâ€”a team of neuroscientists and political consultantsâ€”ran 20 of these undecided volunteers through a brain scanner and showed them pictures and video of the major candidates from both parties. The results, laid out both in print and an online slide show, purport to give us some insight as to how the upcoming primaries will play out: “Mitt Romney may have some potential,” the researchers conclude, and Hillary Clinton seems to have an edge at winning over her opponents. 
 
Don’t believe a word of it. To liken these neurological pundits to snake-oil salesmen would be far too generous.

<p>Introduction: I must be too cynical.  I thought I didn’t like  Philip Zimbardo ‘s theatrics, but regardless I really appreciated  this NYT interview  with him on the universal capacity for evil.     (S.P.E. is the  Stanford Prison Experiment , whose pictures here are from that lovely basement hallway, still there behind the 420-40 and 41 lecture rooms.)
 
In particular: 
 Q. What was your reaction when you first saw those photographs from Abu Ghraib? 
 
A. I was shocked. But not surprised. I immediately flashed on similar pictures from the S.P.E. What particularly bothered me was that the Pentagon blamed the whole thing on a “few bad apples.” I knew from our experiment, if you put good apples into a bad situation, you’ll get bad apples.
 
That was why I was willing to be an expert witness for Sgt. Chip Frederick, who was ultimately sentenced to eight years for his role at Abu Ghraib. Frederick was the Army reservist who was put in charge of the night shift at Tier 1A, where detainees were abused.

<p>Introduction: In San Francisco, it’s no secret who everyone wanted to win in this election.  Shortly after Obama’s victory speech last night, people started celebrating in the streets near my house in the Mission.  At Valencia and 19th, a big party formed and ran for several hours into the night.
     
     
  People and kids were cheering, high-fiving, playing music, and having a good time:
 
            
 
Shades of  Burning Man : There were happy combinations of alcohol, police, art cars, fireworks, and the  Extra Action Marching Band .
 
            
 
(That clip was the tensest situation I saw; after that, the police just moved everyone out of the intersection and watched carefully.)
 
            
 
            
 
I yelled “Yes we can!” and was answered “Yes we DID!”  Strangers hugged me.  I went home at 1 a.m. and the party was still going strong.  Not the worst way to celebrate making history.
 
This election was also big locally, including a tight three-way race for the local district chair</p><p>5 0.39620808 <a title="35-lsi-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2004/brendan_oconnor_ai-2004-11-20-gintis%3A_theoretical_unity_in_the_social_sciences.html">1 brendan oconnor ai-2004-11-20-gintis: theoretical unity in the social sciences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Herbert Gintis thinks  it’s time to unify the behavioral sciences. Sociology, economics, political science, human biology, anthropology and others all study the same thing, but each is based on different incompatible models of individual human behavior. There seems to be evidence that new developments have the potential to offer a more unifying theory. Evolutionary biology should be the basis of understanding much of human behavior. Rational choice and game theoretic frameworks are finding greater acceptance beyond economics; in the meantime, other fields need to absorb sociology’s emphasis on socialization — that people do things or understand the world in a way taught by society. The human behavioral sciences are still rife with many smaller inconsistencies; for example, according to Gintis, only anthropolgists look at the influence of culture across groups, but only sociologists look at culture within groups.
 
Gintis’ ultimate goal is to have a common baseline from which each disci</p><p>6 0.38130441 <a title="35-lsi-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-09-02-cognitive_modelling_is_rational_choice%2B%2B.html">26 brendan oconnor ai-2005-09-02-cognitive modelling is rational choice++</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I started reading Jeffrey Sachs’ new book  The End of Poverty .  The first 30 pages are excellent, but it starts getting arrogant and annoying quick.  Substantively, I’m uncertain whether a big new development aid push will solve things.
 
Since I enthusiastically bum around course websites I’m not taking (bad habit, will stop real soon now), I was fortunate to run across an excellent debate between Sachs and William Easterly:
 
 Easterly’s view on Africa: The West Can’t Take The Lead  which has some amazing anecdotes about African educators and entrepreneurs.  (Or, I think they’re amazing only because I’m a condescending Westerner?)
 
 Easterly reviews Sachs .  Choice quote: 
 “Success in ending the poverty trap,” Sachs writes, “will be much easier than it appears.” Really? If it’s so easy, why haven’t five decades of effort gotten the job done? Sachs should redirect some of his outrage at the question of why the previous $2.3 trillion didn’t reach the poor so that the next $2.3 trill</p><p>3 0.91130674 <a title="35-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-07-04-City_crisis_simulation_%28e.g._terrorist_attack%29.html">14 brendan oconnor ai-2005-07-04-City crisis simulation (e.g. terrorist attack)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: WP:  Computers simulate terrorist extremes 
 
Los Alamos scientists are running terrorist attack/response simulations. Well, the article title is misleading, they’re not simulating terrorists (which would pose a whole set of interesting questions about scientific knowledge, social construction and security), but rather, the impact on telecomm, health, and infrastructure systems.  They’re using the standard justifications for systems simulation: these are big, highly complex, highly interdependent systems that are ill-understood and have had drastic domino-effect collapses before (like the northeast power blackout).
 
The article also talks about epidemiology simulations (smallpox in this case, following the terrorist scenario again) that take into account the interactions of individual people with each other — very much along the lines of agent-based simulations, and satisfying complexity theory’s arguments about tipping points and emergent effects.  [The article doesn't seem to say wh</p><p>4 0.16850749 <a title="35-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-10-11-It_is_accurate_to_determine_a_blog%E2%80%99s_bias_by_what_it_links_to.html">117 brendan oconnor ai-2008-10-11-It is accurate to determine a blog’s bias by what it links to</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here’s a great project from Andy Baio and Joshua Schachter : they assessed the political biases of different blogs based on which articles they tend link to.  Using these political bias scores, they made a cool little Firefox extension that colors the names of different sources on the news aggregator site  Memeorandum , like so:
 
 
 
How they computed these biases is pretty neat.  Their data source was the Memeorandum site itself, which shows a particular news story, then a list of different news sites that have written articles about the topic.  Scraping out that data, Joshua constructed the adjacency matrix of sites vs. articles they linked to and ran good ol’  SVD  on it, an algorithm that can be used to summarize the very high-dimensional article linking information in just several numbers (“components” or “dimensions”) for each news site.  Basically, the algorithm groups together sites that tend to link to the same articles.  It’s not exactly clustering though; rather, it project</p><p>5 0.16058767 <a title="35-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2011/brendan_oconnor_ai-2011-10-05-Be_careful_with_dictionary-based_text_analysis.html">176 brendan oconnor ai-2011-10-05-Be careful with dictionary-based text analysis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: OK, everyone loves to run dictionary methods for sentiment and other text analysis — counting words from a predefined lexicon in a big corpus, in order to explore or test hypotheses about the corpus.  In particular, this is often done for sentiment analysis: count positive and negative words (according to a sentiment polarity lexicon, which was derived from human raters or previous researchers’ intuitions), and then proclaim the output yields sentiment levels of the documents.  More and more papers come out every day that do this.   I’ve done this myself.   It’s interesting and fun, but it’s easy to get a bunch of meaningless numbers if you don’t carefully validate what’s going on.  There are certainly good studies in this area that do further validation and analysis, but it’s hard to trust a study that just presents a graph with a few overly strong speculative claims as to its meaning.  This happens more than it ought to.

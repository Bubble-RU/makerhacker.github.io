<p>Introduction: In San Francisco, it’s no secret who everyone wanted to win in this election.  Shortly after Obama’s victory speech last night, people started celebrating in the streets near my house in the Mission.  At Valencia and 19th, a big party formed and ran for several hours into the night.
     
     
  People and kids were cheering, high-fiving, playing music, and having a good time:
 
            
 
Shades of  Burning Man : There were happy combinations of alcohol, police, art cars, fireworks, and the  Extra Action Marching Band .
 
            
 
(That clip was the tensest situation I saw; after that, the police just moved everyone out of the intersection and watched carefully.)
 
            
 
            
 
I yelled “Yes we can!” and was answered “Yes we DID!”  Strangers hugged me.  I went home at 1 a.m. and the party was still going strong.  Not the worst way to celebrate making history.

<p>Introduction: An two-step explanation for distrust of science: (1) journalists write up poor science or take out the evidence and information from a scientific study, then (2) people read that and criticize science for being unfounded, arbitrary, etc.   Link .  Some fun quotes:   
 Statistics are what causes the most fear for reporters, and so they are usually just edited out, with interesting consequences. Because science isn’t about something being true or not true: that’s a humanities graduate parody. It’s about the error bar, statistical significance, it’s about how reliable and valid the experiment was, it’s about coming to a verdict, about a hypothesis, on the back of lots of bits of evidence.  
 
 and   
 
  So how do the media work around their inability to deliver scientific evidence? They use authority figures, the very antithesis of what science is about, as if they were priests, or politicians, or parent figures. “Scientists today said … scientists revealed … scientists warned.” And if t</p><p>5 0.045868061 <a title="36-tfidf-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2012/brendan_oconnor_ai-2012-07-17-p-values%2C_CDF%E2%80%99s%2C_NLP_etc..html">185 brendan oconnor ai-2012-07-17-p-values, CDF’s, NLP etc.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update Aug 10: THIS IS NOT A SUMMARY OF THE WHOLE PAPER!  it’s whining about one particular method of analysis before talking about other things further down
   
A quick note on  Berg-Kirkpatrick et al EMNLP-2012, “An Empirical Investigation of Statistical Signiﬁcance in NLP” .  They make lots of graphs of p-values against observed magnitudes and talk about “curves”, e.g.
 
 We see the same curve-shaped trend we saw for summarization and dependency parsing. Different group comparisons, same group comparisons, and system combination comparisons form distinct curves. 
 
For example, Figure 2.
 
   
 
I fear they made 10 graphs to rediscover a basic statistical fact: a p-value comes from a null hypothesis CDF.  That’s what these “curve-shaped trends” are in all their graphs.  They are CDFs.
 
To back up, the statistical significance testing question is whether, in their notation, the observed dataset performance difference \(\delta(x)\) is “real” or not: if you were to resample the data,</p><p>6 0.04491441 <a title="36-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-01-02-The_Jungle_Economy.html">47 brendan oconnor ai-2007-01-02-The Jungle Economy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I wish I knew Hebrew .  Well, fortunately there is also an English article version of  Equilibrium in the Jungle  (Piccione and Rubinstein ’06): 
 In the typical analysis of an exchange economy, agents are involved in consumption and exchange goods voluntarily when mutually beneficial. The endowments and the preferences are the primitives of the model. The distribution of consumption in society is determined endogenously through trade.  
 
This paper is motivated by a complementary perspective on human interaction. Throughout the history of mankind, it has been quite common (and we suspect that it will remain so in the future) that economic agents, individually or collectively, use power to seize control of assets held by others.  The exercise of power is pervasive in every society and takes several forms. Often, power is purely physical. Sometimes, however, power is more gentle.  In the male-female “market”, for example, charm and attraction play a key role in obtaining a favourite ma</p><p>5 0.26411852 <a title="36-lsi-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-07-22-FFT%3A_Friedman_%2B_Fortran_%2B_Tricks.html">147 brendan oconnor ai-2009-07-22-FFT: Friedman + Fortran + Tricks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: …is a tongue-in-cheek phrase from Trevor Hastie’s  very fun to read useR-2009 presentation , from the merry trio of Hastie, Friedman, and Tibshirani, who brought us, among other things, the excellent  Elements of Statistical Learning textbook .  It’s a joy to read sophisticated but well-presented work like this.
 
This comes from a slide explaining the impressive speed results for their  glmnet  regression package.  Substantively, I’m interested in their observation that coordinate descent works well for sparse data — if you’re optimizing one feature at a time, and that feature is used in only a small percentage of instances, there are some neat optimizations!
 
But mostly, I had a fun time skimming the  glmnet code .  It’s written in 2008, but, yes,  the core algorithm is written entirely in Fortran , complete with punchcard-style, fixed-width formatting!  (This seems gratuitous to me — I thought the modern  Fortran-90  had done away with such things?)  I’ve felt clever enough making</p><p>6 0.24944977 <a title="36-lsi-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2012/brendan_oconnor_ai-2012-07-17-p-values%2C_CDF%E2%80%99s%2C_NLP_etc..html">185 brendan oconnor ai-2012-07-17-p-values, CDF’s, NLP etc.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Monkeys drink more alcohol when housed alone, and some like to end a long day in the lab with a boozy cocktail, according to a new analysis of alcohol consumption among members of a rhesus macaque social group. … “It was not unusual to see some of the monkeys stumble and fall, sway, and vomit,” Chen added. “In a few of our heavy drinkers, they would drink until they fell asleep.” … In yet another study, the scientists gave a group of male monkeys 24-hour access to the beverage dispensers. According to the researchers, a spike in consumption immediately followed the facilityâ€™s working hours. 
 
“Like humans, monkeys are more likely to drink after stressful periods, such as soon after the daily 8-5 testing hours and after a long week of testing,” said Chen.

<p>Introduction: Update Aug 10: THIS IS NOT A SUMMARY OF THE WHOLE PAPER!  it’s whining about one particular method of analysis before talking about other things further down
   
A quick note on  Berg-Kirkpatrick et al EMNLP-2012, “An Empirical Investigation of Statistical Signiﬁcance in NLP” .  They make lots of graphs of p-values against observed magnitudes and talk about “curves”, e.g.
 
 We see the same curve-shaped trend we saw for summarization and dependency parsing. Different group comparisons, same group comparisons, and system combination comparisons form distinct curves. 
 
For example, Figure 2.
 
   
 
I fear they made 10 graphs to rediscover a basic statistical fact: a p-value comes from a null hypothesis CDF.  That’s what these “curve-shaped trends” are in all their graphs.  They are CDFs.
 
To back up, the statistical significance testing question is whether, in their notation, the observed dataset performance difference \(\delta(x)\) is “real” or not: if you were to resample the data,</p><p>3 0.17832628 <a title="36-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-12-03-Statistics_vs._Machine_Learning%2C_fight%21.html">129 brendan oconnor ai-2008-12-03-Statistics vs. Machine Learning, fight!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: This is a good idea: in a search engine’s query logs, look for outbreaks of queries like [[flu symptoms]] in a given region.  I’ve heard (from  Roddy ) that this trick also works well on Facebook statuses (e.g. “Feeling crappy this morning, think I just got the flu”).
  
  Google Uses Web Searches to Track Flu’s Spread – NYTimes.com  
  Google Flu Trends – google.org  
  
For an example with a publicly available data feed, these queries works decently well on Twitter search:
 
 [[ flu -shot -google ]]  (high recall)
 
 [[ "muscle aches" flu -shot ]]  (high precision)
     
 
The “muscle aches” query is too sparse and the general query is too noisy, but you could imagine some more tricks to clean it up, then train a classifier, etc.  With a bit more work it looks like geolocation information can be had out of the  Twitter search API .</p><p>5 0.16436075 <a title="36-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2014/brendan_oconnor_ai-2014-02-19-What_the_ACL-2014_review_scores_mean.html">203 brendan oconnor ai-2014-02-19-What the ACL-2014 review scores mean</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve had several people ask me what the numbers in  ACL  reviews mean — and I can’t find anywhere online where they’re described.  (Can anyone point this out if it is somewhere?)
 
So here’s the review form, below.  They all go from 1 to 5, with 5 the best.  I think the review emails to authors only include a subset of the below — for example, “Overall Recommendation” is not included?
 
The CFP said that they have different types of review forms for different types of papers.  I think this one is for a standard full paper.  I guess what people  really  want to know is what scores tend to correspond to acceptances.  I really have no idea and I get the impression this can change year to year.  I have no involvement with the ACL conference besides being one of many, many reviewers.

Does the paper fit in ACL 2014? (Please answer this question in light of the desire to broaden the scope of the research areas represented at ACL.)

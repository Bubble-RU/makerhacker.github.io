<p>Introduction: WP:  Computers simulate terrorist extremes 
 
Los Alamos scientists are running terrorist attack/response simulations. Well, the article title is misleading, they’re not simulating terrorists (which would pose a whole set of interesting questions about scientific knowledge, social construction and security), but rather, the impact on telecomm, health, and infrastructure systems.  They’re using the standard justifications for systems simulation: these are big, highly complex, highly interdependent systems that are ill-understood and have had drastic domino-effect collapses before (like the northeast power blackout).
 
The article also talks about epidemiology simulations (smallpox in this case, following the terrorist scenario again) that take into account the interactions of individual people with each other — very much along the lines of agent-based simulations, and satisfying complexity theory’s arguments about tipping points and emergent effects.

<p>Introduction: Great Microsoft Research report (from a workshop they held?):   2020 Science  where they argue that computer  science  will become part and parcel of science in general.  For example, computation theory will be important to understand biological organisms as information processing systems.  This is basically a much better version of Wolfram’s  New Kind of Science  argument — I believe this one.  The big shared insight is that computers aren’t just about data storage and number crunching.  Wolfram and the some of the Santa Fe complex systems people are really in to simulations, which is fine.  But there’s tremendous potential in computation  theory  — algorithms, formal representations, and more.  Empirical scientists are going to have to learn this stuff!</p><p>2 0.89837074 <a title="32-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-07-22-FFT%3A_Friedman_%2B_Fortran_%2B_Tricks.html">147 brendan oconnor ai-2009-07-22-FFT: Friedman + Fortran + Tricks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: …is a tongue-in-cheek phrase from Trevor Hastie’s  very fun to read useR-2009 presentation , from the merry trio of Hastie, Friedman, and Tibshirani, who brought us, among other things, the excellent  Elements of Statistical Learning textbook .  It’s a joy to read sophisticated but well-presented work like this.
 
This comes from a slide explaining the impressive speed results for their  glmnet  regression package.  Substantively, I’m interested in their observation that coordinate descent works well for sparse data — if you’re optimizing one feature at a time, and that feature is used in only a small percentage of instances, there are some neat optimizations!
 
But mostly, I had a fun time skimming the  glmnet code .  It’s written in 2008, but, yes,  the core algorithm is written entirely in Fortran , complete with punchcard-style, fixed-width formatting!  (This seems gratuitous to me — I thought the modern  Fortran-90  had done away with such things?)  I’ve felt clever enough making</p><p>3 0.45977914 <a title="32-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2013/brendan_oconnor_ai-2013-08-20-Some_analysis_of_tweet_shares_and_%E2%80%9Cpredicting%E2%80%9D_election_outcomes.html">198 brendan oconnor ai-2013-08-20-Some analysis of tweet shares and “predicting” election outcomes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Everyone recently seems to be talking about  this newish paper by Digrazia, McKelvey, Bollen, and Rojas  ( pdf here ) that examines the correlation of Congressional candidate name mentions on Twitter against whether the candidate won the race.  One of the coauthors also wrote a Washington Post  Op-Ed  about it.  I read the paper and I think it’s reasonable, but their op-ed overstates their results.  It claims:
  
“In the 2010 data, our Twitter data predicted the winner in 404 out of 435 competitive races”
  
But this analysis is nowhere in their paper.  Fabio Rojas has now  posted errata/rebuttals  about the op-ed and described this analysis they did here.  There are several major issues off the bat:
  
 They didn’t ever predict 404/435 races; they only analyzed 406 races they call “competitive,” getting 92.5% (in-sample) accuracy, then extrapolated to all races to get the 435 number. 
 They’re reporting about  in-sample  predictions, which is really misleading to a non-scientific audi</p><p>4 0.45785245 <a title="32-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-12-27-Facebook_sentiment_mining_predicts_presidential_polls.html">131 brendan oconnor ai-2008-12-27-Facebook sentiment mining predicts presidential polls</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m a bit late blogging this, but here’s a messy, exciting — and statistically validated! — new online data source.
 
My friend  Roddy  at Facebook  wrote a post describing their sentiment analysis system , which can evaluate positive or negative sentiment toward a particular topic by looking at a large number of wall messages.  (I’d link to it, but I can’t find the URL anymore — here’s the  Lexicon , but that version only gets term frequencies but no sentiment.)
 
How they constructed their sentiment detector is interesting.  Starting with a list of positive and negative terms, they had a lexical acquisition step to gather many more candidate synonyms and misspellings — a necessity in this social media domain, where  WordNet  ain’t gonna come close!  After manually filtering these candidates, they assess the sentiment toward a mention of a topic by looking for instances of these positive and negative words nearby, along with “negation heuristics” and a few other features.

<p>Introduction: The idea for a shared task on web parsing is really cool.  But I don’t get this one:
 
 Shared Task – SANCL 2012 (First Workshop on Syntactic Analysis of Non-Canonical Language) 
 
They’re explicitly banning
  
 Manually annotating in-domain (web) sentences
  Creating new word clusters, or anything, from as much text data as possible
   
… instead restricting participants to the data sets they release.
 
Isn’t a cycle of annotation, error analysis, and new annotations (a self-training + active-learning loop, with smarter decisions through error analysis) the hands-down best way to make an NLP tool for a new domain? Are people scared of this reality?  Am I off-base?
 
I am, of course, just advocating for our  Twitter POS tagger  approach, where we annotated some data, made a supervised tagger, and iterated on features.  The biggest weakness in that paper is we didn’t have additional iterations of error analysis.  Our lack of semi-supervised learning was  not  a weakness.</p><p>6 0.42065397 <a title="32-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-10-08-Blog_move_has_landed.html">115 brendan oconnor ai-2008-10-08-Blog move has landed</a></p>

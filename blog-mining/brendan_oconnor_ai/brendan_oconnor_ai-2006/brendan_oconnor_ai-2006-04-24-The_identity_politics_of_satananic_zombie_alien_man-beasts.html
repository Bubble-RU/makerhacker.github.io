NYT  reports : 
 ATHENS, May 20 (AP) â€” In what some fans called a stunning upset, a Finnish heavy metal band with monster masks and apocalyptic lyrics won the Eurovision Song Contest late Saturday. 
 
The band, Lordi, caused a bit of a national identity crisis in Finland, where opponents accused it of devil worship and cringed at the thought that it might win.
 
The annual kitsch extravaganza, which was the springboard for the Swedish group Abba and Celine Dion, is known for its bland dance music and bubble-gum pop acts. This year groups from 24 countries faced off before tens of millions on television.
 
The band’s members do not disclose their real names.

<p>Introduction: These are both useful summaries.  Slate has a  chart of relationships  between Hamas, Hezbollah, Israel, and Lebanon, versus a number of different actors in the region.  NYTimes has  something similar on a map , also showing the sizes of ethnic/religious groups.  Seems the NYTimes is most interesting as far as visualization/graphic design goes.  It also has rich relational information and lots of predicates: does group X have oil wealth?  is group X in the government of country Y?  Etc.  Seems ripe for a  relational concept-learning clustering analysisâ&euro;Ś

<p>Introduction: Contrary to  baseless speculation , it turns out it  is  possible to have a four-player, non-degenerate RPS game.  The game below is assymetrical: B does better than others, but you don’t want to play it all the time because that makes you vulnerable to A.  By contrast, D ain’t so hot.  But if you never play D, then your opponent can get away with A.  It’s uneven, but the optimal mixed strategy plays everything with non-zero probability.
 
     
 
Notation: the arrow from A to B means that A beats B.  Everyone ties themself.  No arrow indicates a tie.  There is a tie between A and C.  The  previous analysis  indicated there is no non-degenerate 4-RPS with no ties.  This has only 1 tie, so it seems to be the best possible.
 
(This game is just the  previous one  with the link from A to C removed.  This makes it so B no longer dominates C, since C is now invulnerable from A, unlike B.)</p><p>5 0.038668189 <a title="33-tfidf-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-01-31-Food_Fight.html">92 brendan oconnor ai-2008-01-31-Food Fight</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Absolutely amazing — a  short film  chronicling conflicts from World War II — as food.
 
  
 
I think this has to have the highest amount of Wikipedia-linkable references per second of any film I’ve seen.  Yes, it’s U.S.-centric, but so is Wikipedia, which makes cataloguing it easier.  At the very least:
 
  World War II 
 
  Persecution of Jews  and  The Holocaust  
  Invasion of France  
  The Blitz  
  Pearl Harbor ,  Pacific Theater  
  D-Day  
  Liberation of France  Invasion of Germany –  Western  and  Eastern  fronts 
  Atomic bombing of Hiroshima  
 
 
  1948 Arab-Israeli War  
  Korean War  
  Cuban Missile Crisis  
  Vietnam War 
 
  French Indochina War  
  U.S. involvement  
 
 
  US/USSR nuclear arms race  
  First Gulf War  
   
  Invasion of Kuwait  
 
   Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
 
 Judging from its timing in the film, maybe specifically the  First Intifada ? 
 
 
  9/11 attacks  
  War in Afghanistan 
 
 Taliban falls, but  some escape , with  Osama bin Laden</p><p>6 0.038513735 <a title="33-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-05-24-Zipf%E2%80%99s_law_and_world_city_populations.html">141 brendan oconnor ai-2009-05-24-Zipf’s law and world city populations</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In San Francisco, it’s no secret who everyone wanted to win in this election.  Shortly after Obama’s victory speech last night, people started celebrating in the streets near my house in the Mission.  At Valencia and 19th, a big party formed and ran for several hours into the night.
     
     
  People and kids were cheering, high-fiving, playing music, and having a good time:
 
            
 
Shades of  Burning Man : There were happy combinations of alcohol, police, art cars, fireworks, and the  Extra Action Marching Band .
 
            
 
(That clip was the tensest situation I saw; after that, the police just moved everyone out of the intersection and watched carefully.)
 
            
 
            
 
I yelled “Yes we can!” and was answered “Yes we DID!”  Strangers hugged me.  I went home at 1 a.m. and the party was still going strong.  Not the worst way to celebrate making history.
 
This election was also big locally, including a tight three-way race for the local district chair</p><p>4 0.16302885 <a title="33-lsi-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-02-05-When_linguists_appear_on_ironic_parody_talk_shows.html">49 brendan oconnor ai-2007-02-05-When linguists appear on ironic parody talk shows</a></p>

<p>Introduction: What a project — an impressively painstaking compilation of  20th century civilian and military casualties .  Summary: lots of people were killed.  Interesting are  the comments on morality and how prejudgement leads to differing casualty estimations  — estimates vary wildly for controversial regimes, like Castro’s Cuba (I’ve heard lots about), but are suspiciously round and agreed-upon for incidents that scholars seem to care less about, like the Congo Crisis of the 1960′s (I’ve heard not so much about.)</p><p>6 0.13723022 <a title="33-lsi-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-05-09-Simpson%E2%80%99s_paradox_is_so_totally_solved.html">60 brendan oconnor ai-2007-05-09-Simpson’s paradox is so totally solved</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I thought  Eurovision  was weird enough already.  But in addition to the usual fun mix of kitschy pop and Cold War legacy nationalism in its telephone voting politics, this year will see Finland’s satanic band Lordi: 
 HELSINKI, Finland â€” They have eight-foot retractable latex Satan wings, sing hits like “Chainsaw Buffet” and blow up slabs of smoking meat on stage. So members of the band Lordi expected a reaction when they beat a crooner of love ballads to represent Finland at the Eurovision song contest in Athens, the competition that was the springboard for Abba and Celine Dion. 
 
    
 “In Finland, we have no Eiffel Tower, few real famous artists, it is freezing cold and we suffer from low self-esteem,” said Mr. Putaansuu, who, as Lordi, has horns protruding from his forehead and sports long black fingernails. 
 
As he stuck out his tongue menacingly, his red demon eyes glaring, Lordi was surrounded by Kita, an alien-man-beast predator who plays flame-spitting drums inside a cage</p><p>2 0.79856837 <a title="33-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-02-15-Pascal%E2%80%99s_Wager.html">50 brendan oconnor ai-2007-02-15-Pascal’s Wager</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Either God is tricky, or maybe probability is.
 
Pascal’s Wager: Say there’s only a small chance God exists.  If you are an atheist but God does actually exist, He will send you to hell for eternity.  This is infinitely bad.  Therefore you should believe in God on the off-chance he does exist, since a small chance of something infinitely bad is worse than the alternative.
 
 Believe in Pascal’s Wager?  Have I got a deal for you!  says if you believe it, you should send Alex Tabarrok money because he will put in a good word to God for you.  Hey, there’s a small chance he has a direct line to God, which yields infinite utility (or avoids hell’s infinite disutility).
 
FWIW, I’m thinking the paradoxes in this sort of arithmetic always happen when you start doing addition/multiplication distribution across those darn infinities.  Like on the third page Tabarrok starts talking about p1*Inf – p2*Inf = (p1-p2)*Inf.  That’s shady shit.

<p>Introduction: Experimental philosophy:  
 Suppose the chairman of a company has to decide whether to adopt a new program. It would increase profits and help the environment too. “I don’t care at all about helping the environment,” the chairman says. “I just want to make as much profit as I can. Let’s start the new program.” Would you say that the chairman intended to help the environment? 
 
O.K., same circumstance. Except this time the program would harm the environment. The chairman, who still couldn’t care less about the environment, authorizes the program in order to get those profits. As expected, the bottom line goes up, the environment goes down. Would you say the chairman harmed the environment intentionally?
 
in one survey, only 23 percent of people said that the chairman in the first situation had intentionally helped the environment. When they had to think about the second situation, though, fully 82 percent thought that the chairman had intentionally harmed the environment.

<p>Introduction: Continuing  our previous story : they’ve won!  Check out the interview at the end of the semifinals here.
 
      
 
NYT  reports : 
 ATHENS, May 20 (AP) â€” In what some fans called a stunning upset, a Finnish heavy metal band with monster masks and apocalyptic lyrics won the Eurovision Song Contest late Saturday. 
 
The band, Lordi, caused a bit of a national identity crisis in Finland, where opponents accused it of devil worship and cringed at the thought that it might win.
 
The annual kitsch extravaganza, which was the springboard for the Swedish group Abba and Celine Dion, is known for its bland dance music and bubble-gum pop acts. This year groups from 24 countries faced off before tens of millions on television.
 
The band’s members do not disclose their real names. The lead singer, Mr. Lordi, said its win, Finland’s first, was “a victory for open-mindedness.” “We are not Satanists,” he said. “This is entertainment.”</p><p>5 0.23966895 <a title="33-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2010/brendan_oconnor_ai-2010-03-31-How_Facebook_privacy_failed_me.html">158 brendan oconnor ai-2010-03-31-How Facebook privacy failed me</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At some point, I put extra email addresses on Facebook because I thought it was necessary for something, but didn’t want to show them, so in the privacy settings marked their visibility as “Only Me.”  It turns out that right now, Facebook is blatantly ignoring that privacy setting, and instead showing them to the world.
 
Here are my settings:
 
   
 
Here is a fragment of my profile, viewed from a friend’s account half an hour ago:
 
   
 
I would complain to their customer service, but I can’t find a link from their  Help Center  page.
 
Obviously, this particular issue is a very minor concern for me.  But it hardly instills faith in the system — especially considering that privacy bugs are ones that the affected user, almost by definition, can’t see.  I’ve also had other weird issues where changes to privacy settings don’t seem to stick when I save then later go back to the page.  It’s annoying and hard to verify these things — which is why important  “social utilities”  like Facebo</p><p>6 0.23355772 <a title="33-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-08-16-A_better_Obama_vs_McCain_poll_aggregation.html">111 brendan oconnor ai-2008-08-16-A better Obama vs McCain poll aggregation</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Rock, Paper, Scissors is making the blog rounds with an excellent strategy guide  from the World RPS Society  and a fun  mental floss article  too.  (Though the  First International RoShamBo programming contest  should be noted.)  Having played far too much RPS last year, I can say these tips look pretty decent for the most part.

Everyone thinks, “but wait, RPS is a lame game.  Playing randomly is the best strategy!”  This is not true.  Playing randomly is the best defensive strategy, since your opponent can never do better than 50% against it.  However, it is not the best offensive strategy if you can infer what your opponent will play.  For example, if you are confident that your opponent is too scared to play scissors for a third time in a row, exploit that and play paper (the only move vulnerable to scissor</p><p>3 0.122537 <a title="43-tfidf-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2004/brendan_oconnor_ai-2004-11-24-addiction_%26_2_problems_of_economics.html">2 brendan oconnor ai-2004-11-24-addiction & 2 problems of economics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is my idea based off of  Bernheim and Rangel’s  model of addict decision-making .  It’s a really neat model; it manages to relax rationality to allow someone to do something they don’t want to do because they’re addicted to it.  [Rationality assumes a nice well-ordered set of preferences; this model hypothesizes as distinction between emotional "liking" and cognitive, forward "wanting" that can conflict.]  The model is mathematically tractable, it can be used for public welfare analysis, and to top it off — it’s got neuroscientific grounding!
 
It appears to me there are two big criticisms of the economics discipline’s assumptions.  One of course is rationality.  The second has to do with the perfect structure of the market and environment that shapes both preferences and the ability to exercise them.  One critique is about social structure: consumers are not atomistic individual units, but rather exchange information and ideas along networks of patterned social relations.

<p>Introduction: Upload your poker hand histories to  www.pokernomics.com , economist Stephen Levitt’s fringe-of-economics project to study what are effective strategies in poker.  This absolultely makes sense to me as an economics research project, only because I’m used to thinking of economics from the view of multi-agent systems and game theory…  This is definitely all about game theory, maybe not economics.  Game theory reaches beyond the bounds of the study of goods and services…

<p>Introduction: Pure game theory is debatably social science, so here goes.
 
    Inspired by various 5-, 7-, and even   25-move extensions  to Rock, Paper, Scissors, my friends and I were wondering whether it’s possible to have an even-move version.  It doesn’t seem possible, at least for 4-RPS.  I conjecture that all even-RPS’s might be similarly impossible.  Here’s a  very! rough writeup .</p><p>4 0.50555164 <a title="43-lsi-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-07-08-Game_outcome_graphs_%E2%80%94_prisoner%E2%80%99s_dilemma_with_FUN_ARROWS%21%21%21.html">68 brendan oconnor ai-2007-07-08-Game outcome graphs — prisoner’s dilemma with FUN ARROWS!!!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I think game theory could benefit immensely from better presentation.  Its default presentation is pretty mathematical.  This is good because it treats social interactions in an abstract way, highlighting their essential properties, but is bad because it’s hard to understand, especially at first.
 
However, I think I have a visualization that can sometimes capture the same abstract properties of the mathematics.  Here’s a stab at using it to explain everyone’s favorite game, the prisoner’s dilemma.
 
THE PD: Two players each choose whether to play nice, or be mean — Cooperate or Defect.  Then they simultaneously play their actions, and get payoffs depending on what both played.  If both cooperated, they help each other and do well; if both defect, they do quite poorly.  But if one tries to cooperate and the other defects, then the defector gets a big win, and the cooperator gets a crappy “sucker’s payoff”.
 
The formal PD definition looks like this:

<p>Introduction: Contrary to  baseless speculation , it turns out it  is  possible to have a four-player, non-degenerate RPS game.  The game below is assymetrical: B does better than others, but you don’t want to play it all the time because that makes you vulnerable to A.  By contrast, D ain’t so hot.  But if you never play D, then your opponent can get away with A.  It’s uneven, but the optimal mixed strategy plays everything with non-zero probability.
 
     
 
Notation: the arrow from A to B means that A beats B.  Everyone ties themself.  No arrow indicates a tie.  There is a tie between A and C.  The  previous analysis  indicated there is no non-degenerate 4-RPS with no ties.  This has only 1 tie, so it seems to be the best possible.
 
(This game is just the  previous one  with the link from A to C removed.  This makes it so B no longer dominates C, since C is now invulnerable from A, unlike B.)</p><p>2 0.72957999 <a title="43-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-10-11-It_is_accurate_to_determine_a_blog%E2%80%99s_bias_by_what_it_links_to.html">117 brendan oconnor ai-2008-10-11-It is accurate to determine a blog’s bias by what it links to</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here’s a great project from Andy Baio and Joshua Schachter : they assessed the political biases of different blogs based on which articles they tend link to.  Using these political bias scores, they made a cool little Firefox extension that colors the names of different sources on the news aggregator site  Memeorandum , like so:
 
 
 
How they computed these biases is pretty neat.  Their data source was the Memeorandum site itself, which shows a particular news story, then a list of different news sites that have written articles about the topic.  Scraping out that data, Joshua constructed the adjacency matrix of sites vs. articles they linked to and ran good ol’  SVD  on it, an algorithm that can be used to summarize the very high-dimensional article linking information in just several numbers (“components” or “dimensions”) for each news site.  Basically, the algorithm groups together sites that tend to link to the same articles.  It’s not exactly clustering though; rather, it project</p><p>3 0.1339874 <a title="43-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2013/brendan_oconnor_ai-2013-08-20-Some_analysis_of_tweet_shares_and_%E2%80%9Cpredicting%E2%80%9D_election_outcomes.html">198 brendan oconnor ai-2013-08-20-Some analysis of tweet shares and “predicting” election outcomes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Everyone recently seems to be talking about  this newish paper by Digrazia, McKelvey, Bollen, and Rojas  ( pdf here ) that examines the correlation of Congressional candidate name mentions on Twitter against whether the candidate won the race.  One of the coauthors also wrote a Washington Post  Op-Ed  about it.  I read the paper and I think it’s reasonable, but their op-ed overstates their results.  It claims:
  
“In the 2010 data, our Twitter data predicted the winner in 404 out of 435 competitive races”
  
But this analysis is nowhere in their paper.  Fabio Rojas has now  posted errata/rebuttals  about the op-ed and described this analysis they did here.  There are several major issues off the bat:
  
 They didn’t ever predict 404/435 races; they only analyzed 406 races they call “competitive,” getting 92.5% (in-sample) accuracy, then extrapolated to all races to get the 435 number. 
 They’re reporting about  in-sample  predictions, which is really misleading to a non-scientific audi</p><p>4 0.13030383 <a title="43-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-12-27-Facebook_sentiment_mining_predicts_presidential_polls.html">131 brendan oconnor ai-2008-12-27-Facebook sentiment mining predicts presidential polls</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m a bit late blogging this, but here’s a messy, exciting — and statistically validated! — new online data source.
 
My friend  Roddy  at Facebook  wrote a post describing their sentiment analysis system , which can evaluate positive or negative sentiment toward a particular topic by looking at a large number of wall messages.  (I’d link to it, but I can’t find the URL anymore — here’s the  Lexicon , but that version only gets term frequencies but no sentiment.)
 
How they constructed their sentiment detector is interesting.  Starting with a list of positive and negative terms, they had a lexical acquisition step to gather many more candidate synonyms and misspellings — a necessity in this social media domain, where  WordNet  ain’t gonna come close!  After manually filtering these candidates, they assess the sentiment toward a mention of a topic by looking for instances of these positive and negative words nearby, along with “negation heuristics” and a few other features.

<p>Introduction: This is a good idea: in a search engine’s query logs, look for outbreaks of queries like [[flu symptoms]] in a given region.  I’ve heard (from  Roddy ) that this trick also works well on Facebook statuses (e.g. “Feeling crappy this morning, think I just got the flu”).
  
  Google Uses Web Searches to Track Flu’s Spread – NYTimes.com  
  Google Flu Trends – google.org  
  
For an example with a publicly available data feed, these queries works decently well on Twitter search:
 
 [[ flu -shot -google ]]  (high recall)
 
 [[ "muscle aches" flu -shot ]]  (high precision)
     
 
The “muscle aches” query is too sparse and the general query is too noisy, but you could imagine some more tricks to clean it up, then train a classifier, etc.  With a bit more work it looks like geolocation information can be had out of the  Twitter search API .</p><p>6 0.12777966 <a title="43-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-12-03-Statistics_vs._Machine_Learning%2C_fight%21.html">129 brendan oconnor ai-2008-12-03-Statistics vs. Machine Learning, fight!</a></p>

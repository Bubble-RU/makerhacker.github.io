<p>Introduction: I previously  posted  two neuroeconomics reviews.   Here’s a new one from this year  in Trends in Cognitive Sciences.  It’s interesting because not only does it look at using psychological knowledge to inform economics, but it also reviews work in the other direction: using economic decision and organizational theory to study brain systems.  For example,   here’s a paper  that analyzes brain reward circuitry using labor supply theory.

<p>Introduction: Since I posted the link to his blog, Baron just  wrote about   Cardinal Schönborn’s anti-evolution Op-Ed piece .  I agree absolutely that people should learn about the psychology of judgment and probability for these sorts of questions, where it’s really hard to understand that random processes can generate things that seem not so random.
 
I’m still thinking about how the psychology of judgment plays in to  the analysis below .  I have a feeling that people’s intuitions are usually too hospitable for explanations based on intention.  E.g.: People are poor, therefore someone is trying to make them poor.  Organizations (corportations, governments) do things, therefore someone (say, at the top) ordered them to do these things.  Natural disasters happen, therefore someone is wishing them upon us.  Etc., etc.  I’m still not sure how a bayesian dissection of whether “looks intentful” implies “is intentful” shows us whether such an “intent-seeking” bias (hey, I have to call it something) is</p><p>5 0.10811595 <a title="44-tfidf-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-08-04-Blogger_to_WordPress_migration_helper.html">149 brendan oconnor ai-2009-08-04-Blogger to WordPress migration helper</a></p>

<p>Introduction: From a graphics/mod programming workshop,  modifications of “Breakout”  in awesome video form:
 
          
 
It uses  Processing , a framework designed for animation and graphicky things.  It was also used for the  Similar Diversity  visualization that maps out named entities and their common verbs across religious texts.  It’s pretty cool:     … so a name gets bigger with its frequency, I get that; but what governs the size of an arc connecting two names?  They say “common activities” — I’m guessing a distance measure on the terms in the contexts in which they appear?  I’d be most interested in a graph of their explicit interactions; something like a count of co-occurrences in a proximity window (word radius? verse? chapter? book?) might do the trick…

<p>Introduction: I don’t care how lame anyone thinks this is, but economic theorist  Ariel Rubinstein  is the shit.  He’s funny, self-deprecating, and brilliant.  I was just re-reading  his delightful, sarcastic review of Freakonomics .  (Overly dramatized visual depiction below; hey, conflict sells.)
 
    The review consists of excerpts from his own upcoming super-worldwide-bestseller, “Freak-Freakonomics”.  It is full of golden quotes such as: 
  Chapter 2: Why do economists earn more than mathematicians?  
 
…
 
The comparison between architects and prostitutes can be applied to mathematicians and economists: The former are more skilled, highly educated and intelligent.  
 
To elaborate: 
 Levitt has never encountered a girl who dreams of being a prostitute and I have never met a child who dreams of being an economist. Like prostitutes, the skill required of economists is “not necessarily ‘specialized’” (106). And, finally, here is a new explanation for the salary gap between mathematicians and eco</p><p>6 0.42851138 <a title="44-lsi-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-08-04-Blogger_to_WordPress_migration_helper.html">149 brendan oconnor ai-2009-08-04-Blogger to WordPress migration helper</a></p>

<p>Introduction: MySpace and the  Commission on the Presidential Debates  put together a neat site,  mydebates.org , which presents the candidates’ positions through various mini-polls and such.  It even has a cool data exploration tool for the poll results … for example, here are two support maps, one for respondents over 65 and one for 18-24 year olds.
 
   
 
    Anyway, the site also takes submissions of questions for tonight’s debate.  Apparently  six million  questions were submitted, and moderator Tom Brokaw will of course use only 10 or so.  This begs a question, how were they selected?  There’s no Digg-like social filtering or anything.  You could imagine automatic methods to help narrow down the pool: Topic clustering?  Quality ranking on syntax and vocabulary?
 
 Eric Fish  suggested the obvious: probably someone picked 1000 randomly and sent them to Brokaw.

<p>Introduction: does this look awesome or what? Imagine if you could computationally model the argumentation and communication in economic and political behavior. To say nothing of the AI applications too!
  
PRELIMINARY ANNOUNCEMENT 1st International Conference on Computational Models of Argument (COMMA06)


Organised by the ASPIC project (www.argumentation.org) The University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK 11th-12th September 2006 (provisional)


General Chair: Professor Michael J. Wooldridge Programme Chair: Paul E. Dunne


Over the past decade argumentation has become increasingly important in Artificial Intelligence. It has provided a fruitful way of approaching non-monotonic and defeasible reasoning, deliberation about action, and agent communication scenarios such as negotiation. In application domains such as law, medicine and e-democracy it has come to be seen as an essential part of the reasoning.


Successful workshops have been associated with major Artificial Intelligence Conferences, notabl</p><p>same-blog 3 0.95781755 <a title="44-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2006/brendan_oconnor_ai-2006-08-30-A_big%2C_fun_list_of_links_I%E2%80%99m_reading.html">44 brendan oconnor ai-2006-08-30-A big, fun list of links I’m reading</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since blogging is hard, but reading is easy, lately I’ve taken to bookmarking interesting articles I’m reading, with the plan of blogging about them later.  This follow-through has happened a few times, but not that often.  In an amazing moment of thesis procrastination, today I sat down and figured out how to turn my  del.icio.us bookmarks  into a nice blogpost, with the plan that every week a post will appear with links I’ve recently read, or maybe I’ll use the script to generate a draft for myself that I’ll revise, or something.
 
But for this first such link post, I put in a whole bunch of them beyond just the last week — why have just a few when you could have *all* of them?  Future link posts will be shorter, I promise.

<p>Introduction: Here is one of our exciting just-finished  ACL  papers.   David  and I designed an algorithm that learns different types of character personas — “Protagonist”, “Love Interest”, etc — that are used in movies.
 
To do this we collected a  brand new dataset : 42,306 plot summaries of movies from Wikipedia, along with metadata like box office revenue and genre.  We ran these through parsing and coreference analysis to also create a dataset of movie characters, linked with Freebase records of the actors who portray them.  Did you see that NYT article on  quantitative analysis of film scripts ?  This dataset could answer all sorts of things they assert in that article — for example, do movies with  bowling scenes  really make less money?  We have released  the data here .
 
Our focus, though, is on narrative analysis.  We investigate  character personas : familiar character types that are repeated over and over in stories, like “Hero” or “Villian”; maybe grand mythical archetypes like “Trick</p><p>5 0.59545761 <a title="44-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2013/brendan_oconnor_ai-2013-09-13-Response_on_our_movie_personas_paper.html">200 brendan oconnor ai-2013-09-13-Response on our movie personas paper</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update (2013-09-17):  See  David Bamman ‘s great  guest post on Language Log  on our latent personas paper, and the big picture of interdisciplinary collaboration.
   
I’ve been informed that an interesting critique of my, David Bamman’s and Noah Smith’s ACL paper on movie personas   has appeared on the Language Log, a guest post by Hannah Alpert-Abrams and Dan Garrette  .  I posted the following as a comment on LL.   
Thanks everyone for the interesting comments.  Scholarship is an ongoing conversation, and we hope our work might contribute to it.  Responding to the concerns about   our paper  , 
We did not try to make a contribution to contemporary literary theory.  Rather, we focus on developing a computational linguistic research method of analyzing characters in stories.  We hope there is a place for both the development of new research methods, as well as actual new substantive findings.

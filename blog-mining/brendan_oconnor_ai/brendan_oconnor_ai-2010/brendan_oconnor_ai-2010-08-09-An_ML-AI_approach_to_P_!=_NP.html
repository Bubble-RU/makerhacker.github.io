<p>Introduction: I think I believe one of these things, but I’m not quite sure. 
 Statistics is just like logic, except with uncertainty. 
 
This would be true if statistics is Bayesian statistics and you buy the Bayesian inductive logic story — add induction to propositional logic, via a conditional credibility operator, and the Cox axioms imply standard probability theory as a consequence.  (That is, probability theory is logic with uncertainty.  And then a good Bayesian thinks probability theory and statistics are the same.)  Links:  Jaynes’ explanation ;  SEP article ; also  Fitelson’s article .  (Though there are negative results; all I can think of right now is a  Halpern  article on Cox; and also interesting is  Halpern and Koller .)
 
Secondly, here is another statement.

<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: There are an increasing number of systems that attempt to allow the user to specify a probabilistic model in a high-level language — for example, declare a (Bayesian) generative model as a hierarchy of various distributions — then automatically run training and inference algorithms on a data set.  Now, you could always learn a good math library, and implement every model from scratch, but the motivation for this approach is you’ll avoid doing lots of repetitive and error-prone programming.  I’m not yet convinced that any of them completely achieve this goal, but it would be great if they succeeded and we could use high-level frameworks for everything.

<p>Introduction: With my friend  Doug , I just finished making a game —   PalinSpeak.com   —  where you can chat with a Sarah Palin simulator.  Check it out, it’s the best thing to hit the Internet since sliced bread.

<p>Introduction: Like everyone, I’ve been just starting to look at the new, tentative,  proof that P != NP  from Vinay Deolalikar.  After reading the intro, what’s most striking is that probabilistic graphical models and mathematical logic are at the core of the proof.  This feels like a machine learning and artificial intelligence-centric approach to me — very different from what you usually see in mainstream CS theory.  (Maybe I should feel good that in my undergrad I basically stopped studying normal math and spent all my time with this weird stuff instead!)
 
He devotes several chapters to an introduction to graphical models — Ising models, conditional independence, MRF’s, Hammersley-Clifford, and all that other stuff you see in  Koller and Friedman  or something — and then logic and model theory!  I’m impressed.</p><p>3 0.94947141 <a title="161-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-05-29-%22Stanford_Impostor%22.html">62 brendan oconnor ai-2007-05-29-"Stanford Impostor"</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve gotten a zillion emails about it by now, but it was recently found that a young woman had been living for a year in Stanford dorms claiming to be a freshman, when in fact she was not a student of any sort at all.  This seems to have engendered much discussion in the Stanford community, e.g.  here .  (The  LA Times  has a decent piece).
 
I mostly think the story is just sad, but a few thoughts:
 
 The security scare angle is a bit ridiculous, as is the blame game being played.
  I suspect the Stanford community is naive and high-strung about these things.  My friends who went to state schools say things like this happen all the time.  Besides, staffs in co-ops are sometimes happy to let vagrants hang out.  The motivations for and mechanics of her deception are clearly the important part of this story (e.g.  how did she live with herself? )
  Her first two quarters were in Kimball, then then her last quarter was in Okada.  I’m surprised the Kimball staff weren’t enough in-touch wit</p><p>4 0.8574385 <a title="161-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-03-24-Quick-R%2C_the_only_decent_R_documentation_on_the_internet.html">97 brendan oconnor ai-2008-03-24-Quick-R, the only decent R documentation on the internet</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For  R  users or wannabes…
 
I really love R, but it has horrid documentation and a steep learning curve.  Recently I was introduced to  Quick-R , a really excellent documentation site.

<p>Introduction: It’s been a good year.  Last fall I started a master’s program in the Language Technologies department at  CMU SCS , taking some great classes, hanging out with a  cool lab , and writing two new papers (for  ICWSM , involving Twitter:  polls  and  tweetmotif ; also did some  coref  work, financial text regression stuff, and looked at  social lexicography .)  I also applied to CS and stats PhD programs at several universities.  Next year I’ll be starting the PhD program in the  Machine Learning Department  here at CMU.
 
I’m excited!  Just the other day I was looking at videos on my old hard drive and found a presentation by  Tom Mitchell  on “the Discipline of Machine Learning” that I downloaded back in 2007 or so.  (Can’t find it online right now, but  this is similar .)  That might be where I heard of the department first.  Maybe some day I will be smarter than the guy who wrote  this rant  (though I am much more pro-stats and anti-ML these days…).
 
Also, I was recently named a fina</p><p>6 0.34858727 <a title="161-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-12-03-Statistics_vs._Machine_Learning%2C_fight%21.html">129 brendan oconnor ai-2008-12-03-Statistics vs. Machine Learning, fight!</a></p>

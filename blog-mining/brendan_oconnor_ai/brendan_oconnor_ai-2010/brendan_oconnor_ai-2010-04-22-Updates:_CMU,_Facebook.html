<p>Introduction: This is off-topic for this blog but here goes.   ConnectU , a small college social networking site, has been in the news due to their  apparently weak lawsuit against Facebook , in which they claim  Mark Zuckerberg  stole their business plan and computer code back when they all were Harvard undergraduates.  (Judges involved have noted the case’s flimsy evidence; some technology commentators — as well as everyone I know — have noted that the business idea wasn’t all that brilliant or original in the first place.)  Zuckerberg, of course, went on to found Facebook and bring it to incredible success.
 
I tried to use the ConnectU site recently, but got an error when searching for a funny name with an apostrophe,  o’connor .  It turns out this was symptomatic of a very grave security flaw in their code, an  SQL injection vulnerability .  While Facebook recently had  a minor security-related glitch , ConnectU’s flaw is far more serious.  A malicious attacker could use this to easily break in</p><p>3 0.10279861 <a title="160-tfidf-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-08-15-East_vs_West_cultural_psychology%21.html">110 brendan oconnor ai-2008-08-15-East vs West cultural psychology!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Great anti-pop-science article of the moment —  Mark Liberman does a take-down  of David Brooks’ apparently  careless column  on cultural psych experiments that purport to show that East Asians are collectivist while Westerns are individualist.
 
From Liberman: 
  Question to Language Log:  Is it correct that if you show an American an image of a fish tank, the American will usually describe the biggest fish in the tank and what it is doing, while if you ask a Chinese person to describe a fish tank, the Chinese will usually describe the context in which the fish swim? 
 
 Answer:  In principle, yes. But first of all, it wasn’t a representative sample of Americans, it was undergraduates in a psychology course at the University of Michigan; and second, it wasn’t Chinese, it was undergraduates in a psychology course at Kyoto University in Japan; and third, it wasn’t a fish tank, it was 10 20-second animated vignettes of underwater scenes; and fourth, the Americans didn’t mention the “foca</p><p>4 0.10174747 <a title="160-tfidf-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-12-03-Statistics_vs._Machine_Learning%2C_fight%21.html">129 brendan oconnor ai-2008-12-03-Statistics vs. Machine Learning, fight!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: At some point, I put extra email addresses on Facebook because I thought it was necessary for something, but didn’t want to show them, so in the privacy settings marked their visibility as “Only Me.”  It turns out that right now, Facebook is blatantly ignoring that privacy setting, and instead showing them to the world.
 
Here are my settings:
 
   
 
Here is a fragment of my profile, viewed from a friend’s account half an hour ago:
 
   
 
I would complain to their customer service, but I can’t find a link from their  Help Center  page.
 
Obviously, this particular issue is a very minor concern for me.  But it hardly instills faith in the system — especially considering that privacy bugs are ones that the affected user, almost by definition, can’t see.  I’ve also had other weird issues where changes to privacy settings don’t seem to stick when I save then later go back to the page.  It’s annoying and hard to verify these things — which is why important  “social utilities”  like Facebo</p><p>4 0.39508709 <a title="160-lsi-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-05-29-%22Stanford_Impostor%22.html">62 brendan oconnor ai-2007-05-29-"Stanford Impostor"</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve gotten a zillion emails about it by now, but it was recently found that a young woman had been living for a year in Stanford dorms claiming to be a freshman, when in fact she was not a student of any sort at all.  This seems to have engendered much discussion in the Stanford community, e.g.  here .  (The  LA Times  has a decent piece).
 
I mostly think the story is just sad, but a few thoughts:
 
 The security scare angle is a bit ridiculous, as is the blame game being played.
  I suspect the Stanford community is naive and high-strung about these things.  My friends who went to state schools say things like this happen all the time.  Besides, staffs in co-ops are sometimes happy to let vagrants hang out.  The motivations for and mechanics of her deception are clearly the important part of this story (e.g.  how did she live with herself? )
  Her first two quarters were in Kimball, then then her last quarter was in Okada.

<p>Introduction: Cosine similarity, Pearson correlations, and OLS coefficients can all be viewed as variants on the inner product — tweaked in different ways for centering and magnitude (i.e. location and scale, or something like that).
 
Details:
 
You have two vectors \(x\) and \(y\) and want to measure similarity between them.  A basic similarity function is the   inner product  
 
\[ Inner(x,y) = \sum_i x_i y_i = \langle x, y \rangle \]
 
If x tends to be high where y is also high, and low where y is low, the inner product will be high — the vectors are more similar.
 
The inner product is unbounded.  One way to make it bounded between -1 and 1 is to divide by the vectors’ L2 norms, giving the   cosine similarity  
 
\[ CosSim(x,y) = \frac{\sum_i x_i y_i}{ \sqrt{ \sum_i x_i^2} \sqrt{ \sum_i y_i^2 } } 
= \frac{ \langle x,y \rangle }{ ||x||\ ||y|| } 
\]
 
This is actually bounded between 0 and 1 if x and y are non-negative.  Cosine similarity has an interpretation as the cosine of the angle between t</p><p>2 0.9371466 <a title="160-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2011/brendan_oconnor_ai-2011-06-14-How_much_text_versus_metadata_is_in_a_tweet%3F.html">171 brendan oconnor ai-2011-06-14-How much text versus metadata is in a tweet?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This should have been a blog post, but I got lazy and wrote a plaintext document instead.

For twitter, context matters: 90% of a tweet is metadata and 10% is text.

<p>Introduction: It’s been a good year.  Last fall I started a master’s program in the Language Technologies department at  CMU SCS , taking some great classes, hanging out with a  cool lab , and writing two new papers (for  ICWSM , involving Twitter:  polls  and  tweetmotif ; also did some  coref  work, financial text regression stuff, and looked at  social lexicography .)  I also applied to CS and stats PhD programs at several universities.  Next year I’ll be starting the PhD program in the  Machine Learning Department  here at CMU.
 
I’m excited!  Just the other day I was looking at videos on my old hard drive and found a presentation by  Tom Mitchell  on “the Discipline of Machine Learning” that I downloaded back in 2007 or so.  (Can’t find it online right now, but  this is similar .)  That might be where I heard of the department first.  Maybe some day I will be smarter than the guy who wrote  this rant  (though I am much more pro-stats and anti-ML these days…).
 
Also, I was recently named a fina</p><p>4 0.37438643 <a title="160-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-08-21-ConnectU.com_SQL_injection_vulnerability%3A_a_story_of_pathetic_hubris_%28and_fun_with_the_password_%E2%80%98password%E2%80%99%29.html">76 brendan oconnor ai-2007-08-21-ConnectU.com SQL injection vulnerability: a story of pathetic hubris (and fun with the password ‘password’)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is off-topic for this blog but here goes.   ConnectU , a small college social networking site, has been in the news due to their  apparently weak lawsuit against Facebook , in which they claim  Mark Zuckerberg  stole their business plan and computer code back when they all were Harvard undergraduates.  (Judges involved have noted the case’s flimsy evidence; some technology commentators — as well as everyone I know — have noted that the business idea wasn’t all that brilliant or original in the first place.)  Zuckerberg, of course, went on to found Facebook and bring it to incredible success.
 
I tried to use the ConnectU site recently, but got an error when searching for a funny name with an apostrophe,  o’connor .  It turns out this was symptomatic of a very grave security flaw in their code, an  SQL injection vulnerability .  While Facebook recently had  a minor security-related glitch , ConnectU’s flaw is far more serious.  A malicious attacker could use this to easily break in</p><p>5 0.33901393 <a title="160-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-12-03-Statistics_vs._Machine_Learning%2C_fight%21.html">129 brendan oconnor ai-2008-12-03-Statistics vs. Machine Learning, fight!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: This is off-topic for this blog but here goes.   ConnectU , a small college social networking site, has been in the news due to their  apparently weak lawsuit against Facebook , in which they claim  Mark Zuckerberg  stole their business plan and computer code back when they all were Harvard undergraduates.  (Judges involved have noted the case’s flimsy evidence; some technology commentators — as well as everyone I know — have noted that the business idea wasn’t all that brilliant or original in the first place.)  Zuckerberg, of course, went on to found Facebook and bring it to incredible success.
 
I tried to use the ConnectU site recently, but got an error when searching for a funny name with an apostrophe,  o’connor .  It turns out this was symptomatic of a very grave security flaw in their code, an  SQL injection vulnerability .  While Facebook recently had  a minor security-related glitch , ConnectU’s flaw is far more serious.  A malicious attacker could use this to easily break in</p><p>4 0.067494698 <a title="158-tfidf-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-12-31-List_of_probabilistic_model_mini-language_toolkits.html">157 brendan oconnor ai-2009-12-31-List of probabilistic model mini-language toolkits</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are an increasing number of systems that attempt to allow the user to specify a probabilistic model in a high-level language — for example, declare a (Bayesian) generative model as a hierarchy of various distributions — then automatically run training and inference algorithms on a data set.  Now, you could always learn a good math library, and implement every model from scratch, but the motivation for this approach is you’ll avoid doing lots of repetitive and error-prone programming.  I’m not yet convinced that any of them completely achieve this goal, but it would be great if they succeeded and we could use high-level frameworks for everything.
 
Everyone seems to know about only a few of them, so here’s a meager attempt to list together a bunch that can be freely downloaded.  There is one package that is far more mature and been around much longer than the rest, so let’s start with:

<p>Introduction: This is fun —  Jamie Callan ‘s group at  CMU LTI  just finished a crawl of 1 billion web pages.  It’s 5 terabytes compressed — big enough so they have to send it to you by mailing hard drives.

One of their motivations was to have a corpus large enough such that research results on it would be taken seriously by search engine companies.  To my mind, this begs the question whether academics should try to innovate in web search, when it’s a research area incredibly dependent on really large, expensive-to-acquire datasets.  And what’s the point?  To slightly improve Google someday?  Don’t they do that pretty well themselves?
 
On the other hand, having a billion web pages around sounds like a lot of fun.  Someone should get Amazon to add this to the  AWS Public Datasets .  Then, to process the data, instead of paying to get 5 TB of data shipped to you, you instead pay Amazon to rent virtual computers that can access the data.  This costs less only to a certain point,</p><p>6 0.054952092 <a title="158-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2010/brendan_oconnor_ai-2010-04-22-Updates%3A_CMU%2C_Facebook.html">160 brendan oconnor ai-2010-04-22-Updates: CMU, Facebook</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This has to be the most quick-and-dirty data visualizer out there: I wrote an ascii art plotter script that takes a column of numbers on stdin and throws out a plot on your console.  I’ve been using it for several months to quickly look at numbers on the commandline, especially from logs and such.  (Back in school I would use gnuplot for this; R is good too.  But sometimes you want to move really fast, esp if you have a few hideous perl -pe one-liners on your hands and mucking around with temp files will interrupt your flow.)

(Judges involved have noted the case’s flimsy evidence; some technology commentators — as well as everyone I know — have noted that the business idea wasn’t all that brilliant or original in the first place.)  Zuckerberg, of course, went on to found Facebook and bring it to incredible success.
 
I tried to use the ConnectU site recently, but got an error when searching for a funny name with an apostrophe,  o’connor .  It turns out this was symptomatic of a very grave security flaw in their code, an  SQL injection vulnerability .  While Facebook recently had  a minor security-related glitch , ConnectU’s flaw is far more serious.  A malicious attacker could use this to easily break in</p><p>5 0.45871338 <a title="158-lsi-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-02-23-Comparison_of_data_analysis_packages%3A_R%2C_Matlab%2C_SciPy%2C_Excel%2C_SAS%2C_SPSS%2C_Stata.html">135 brendan oconnor ai-2009-02-23-Comparison of data analysis packages: R, Matlab, SciPy, Excel, SAS, SPSS, Stata</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lukas  and I were trying to write a succinct comparison of the most popular packages that are typically used for data analysis.  I think most people choose one based on what people around them use or what they learn in school, so I’ve found it hard to find comparative information.  I’m posting the table here in hopes of useful comments.

<p>Introduction: Continuing  our previous story : they’ve won!  Check out the interview at the end of the semifinals here.
 
      
 
NYT  reports : 
 ATHENS, May 20 (AP) â€” In what some fans called a stunning upset, a Finnish heavy metal band with monster masks and apocalyptic lyrics won the Eurovision Song Contest late Saturday. 
 
The band, Lordi, caused a bit of a national identity crisis in Finland, where opponents accused it of devil worship and cringed at the thought that it might win.
 
The annual kitsch extravaganza, which was the springboard for the Swedish group Abba and Celine Dion, is known for its bland dance music and bubble-gum pop acts. This year groups from 24 countries faced off before tens of millions on television.
 
The band’s members do not disclose their real names. The lead singer, Mr. Lordi, said its win, Finland’s first, was “a victory for open-mindedness.” “We are not Satanists,” he said. “This is entertainment.”</p><p>same-blog 2 0.88634908 <a title="158-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2010/brendan_oconnor_ai-2010-03-31-How_Facebook_privacy_failed_me.html">158 brendan oconnor ai-2010-03-31-How Facebook privacy failed me</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At some point, I put extra email addresses on Facebook because I thought it was necessary for something, but didn’t want to show them, so in the privacy settings marked their visibility as “Only Me.”  It turns out that right now, Facebook is blatantly ignoring that privacy setting, and instead showing them to the world.
 
Here are my settings:
 
   
 
Here is a fragment of my profile, viewed from a friend’s account half an hour ago:
 
   
 
I would complain to their customer service, but I can’t find a link from their  Help Center  page.
 
Obviously, this particular issue is a very minor concern for me.  But it hardly instills faith in the system — especially considering that privacy bugs are ones that the affected user, almost by definition, can’t see.  I’ve also had other weird issues where changes to privacy settings don’t seem to stick when I save then later go back to the page.  It’s annoying and hard to verify these things — which is why important  “social utilities”  like Facebo</p><p>3 0.8550455 <a title="158-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-08-16-A_better_Obama_vs_McCain_poll_aggregation.html">111 brendan oconnor ai-2008-08-16-A better Obama vs McCain poll aggregation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:  Charles Franklin (of Pollster.com) kindly emailed me with many interesting points on this post.  One important note is that my technique isn’t really “no smoothing” — rather, there is now implicit smoothing within the polling houses, by assuming that responses are evenly distributed across the time interval of the poll.
   I was looking at Pollster.com’s page that aggregates many opinion polls on the Presidential race.    Here, they have a chart   that shows the many polls plus lowess fits: 
   
 
So there’s a trend of Obama recently declining.  But it wasn’t clear to me that the fitted curve was correct.  I downloaded the data and started playing around with it.
 
Here are several more graphs I made, with different smoothing parameters for the lowess fit.  Your interpretation completely changes depending which smoothing parameter you like best!
 
   
 
Well, maybe this is an argument to use rolling averages over a fixed number of days or something.  But it would be nice to di</p><p>4 0.44342884 <a title="158-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2006/brendan_oconnor_ai-2006-04-24-The_identity_politics_of_satananic_zombie_alien_man-beasts.html">33 brendan oconnor ai-2006-04-24-The identity politics of satananic zombie alien man-beasts</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I thought  Eurovision  was weird enough already.  But in addition to the usual fun mix of kitschy pop and Cold War legacy nationalism in its telephone voting politics, this year will see Finland’s satanic band Lordi: 
 HELSINKI, Finland â€” They have eight-foot retractable latex Satan wings, sing hits like “Chainsaw Buffet” and blow up slabs of smoking meat on stage. So members of the band Lordi expected a reaction when they beat a crooner of love ballads to represent Finland at the Eurovision song contest in Athens, the competition that was the springboard for Abba and Celine Dion. 
 
    
 “In Finland, we have no Eiffel Tower, few real famous artists, it is freezing cold and we suffer from low self-esteem,” said Mr. Putaansuu, who, as Lordi, has horns protruding from his forehead and sports long black fingernails. 
 
As he stuck out his tongue menacingly, his red demon eyes glaring, Lordi was surrounded by Kita, an alien-man-beast predator who plays flame-spitting drums inside a cage</p><p>5 0.38188145 <a title="158-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-12-03-Statistics_vs._Machine_Learning%2C_fight%21.html">129 brendan oconnor ai-2008-12-03-Statistics vs. Machine Learning, fight!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

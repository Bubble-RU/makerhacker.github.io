</p><p>12 We’ve also been in conversation with other humanists — as we stated in our acknowledgments (noted by one commenter) — though apparently not the same humanists that Alpert-Abrams and Garrett would rather we had talked to. [sent-17, score-0.369]
</p><p>13 This is why it’s better to publish early and participate in the scholarly conversation. [sent-18, score-0.351]
</p><p>14 For what it’s worth, some of these high-level debates on whether it’s appropriate to focus on progress in quantitative methods, versus directly on substantive findings, have been playing out for decades in the social sciences. [sent-19, score-0.432]

<p>Introduction: Here is one of our exciting just-finished  ACL  papers.   David  and I designed an algorithm that learns different types of character personas — “Protagonist”, “Love Interest”, etc — that are used in movies.
 
To do this we collected a  brand new dataset : 42,306 plot summaries of movies from Wikipedia, along with metadata like box office revenue and genre.  We ran these through parsing and coreference analysis to also create a dataset of movie characters, linked with Freebase records of the actors who portray them.  Did you see that NYT article on  quantitative analysis of film scripts ?  This dataset could answer all sorts of things they assert in that article — for example, do movies with  bowling scenes  really make less money?  We have released  the data here .
 
Our focus, though, is on narrative analysis.  We investigate  character personas : familiar character types that are repeated over and over in stories, like “Hero” or “Villian”; maybe grand mythical archetypes like “Trick</p><p>3 0.15394729 <a title="200-tfidf-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2014/brendan_oconnor_ai-2014-02-19-What_the_ACL-2014_review_scores_mean.html">203 brendan oconnor ai-2014-02-19-What the ACL-2014 review scores mean</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve had several people ask me what the numbers in  ACL  reviews mean — and I can’t find anywhere online where they’re described.  (Can anyone point this out if it is somewhere?)
 
So here’s the review form, below.  They all go from 1 to 5, with 5 the best.  I think the review emails to authors only include a subset of the below — for example, “Overall Recommendation” is not included?
 
The CFP said that they have different types of review forms for different types of papers.  I think this one is for a standard full paper.  I guess what people  really  want to know is what scores tend to correspond to acceptances.  I really have no idea and I get the impression this can change year to year.  I have no involvement with the ACL conference besides being one of many, many reviewers.

<p>Introduction: I haven’t done a paper review on this blog for a while, so here we go.
 
 Coreference  resolution is an interesting NLP problem.  ( Examples. )  It involves honest-to-goodness syntactic, semantic, and discourse phenomena, but still seems like a real cognitive task that humans have to solve when reading text [1].  I haven’t read the whole literature, but I’ve always been puzzled by the crop of papers on it I’ve seen in the last year or two.  There’s a big focus on fancy graph/probabilistic/constrained optimization algorithms, but often these papers gloss over the linguistic features — the core information they actually make their decisions with [2].  I never understood why the latter isn’t the most important issue.  Therefore, it was a joy to read

<p>Introduction: Freud Is Widely Taught at Universities, Except in the Psychology Department :
  
PSYCHOANALYSIS and its ideas about the unconscious mind have spread to every nook and cranny of the culture from Salinger to “South Park,” from Fellini to foreign policy. Yet if you want to learn about psychoanalysis at the nation’s top universities, one of the last places to look may be the psychology department.


A new report by the American Psychoanalytic Association has found that while psychoanalysis — or what purports to be psychoanalysis — is alive and well in literature, film, history and just about every other subject in the humanities, psychology departments and textbooks treat it as “desiccated and dead,” a historical artifact instead of “an ongoing movement and a living, evolving process.”
  
I’ve been wondering about this for a while, ever since I heard someone describe Freud as “one of the greatest humanists who ever lived.”  I’m pretty sure he didn’t think of himself that way.

<p>Introduction: Update (2013-09-17):  See  David Bamman ‘s great  guest post on Language Log  on our latent personas paper, and the big picture of interdisciplinary collaboration.
   
I’ve been informed that an interesting critique of my, David Bamman’s and Noah Smith’s ACL paper on movie personas   has appeared on the Language Log, a guest post by Hannah Alpert-Abrams and Dan Garrette  .  I posted the following as a comment on LL.   
Thanks everyone for the interesting comments.  Scholarship is an ongoing conversation, and we hope our work might contribute to it.  Responding to the concerns about   our paper  , 
We did not try to make a contribution to contemporary literary theory.  Rather, we focus on developing a computational linguistic research method of analyzing characters in stories.  We hope there is a place for both the development of new research methods, as well as actual new substantive findings.  If you think about the tremendous possibilities for computer science and humanities collabor</p><p>4 0.41784447 <a title="200-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2006/brendan_oconnor_ai-2006-08-30-A_big%2C_fun_list_of_links_I%E2%80%99m_reading.html">44 brendan oconnor ai-2006-08-30-A big, fun list of links I’m reading</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since blogging is hard, but reading is easy, lately I’ve taken to bookmarking interesting articles I’m reading, with the plan of blogging about them later.  This follow-through has happened a few times, but not that often.  In an amazing moment of thesis procrastination, today I sat down and figured out how to turn my  del.icio.us bookmarks  into a nice blogpost, with the plan that every week a post will appear with links I’ve recently read, or maybe I’ll use the script to generate a draft for myself that I’ll revise, or something.
 
But for this first such link post, I put in a whole bunch of them beyond just the last week — why have just a few when you could have *all* of them?  Future link posts will be shorter, I promise.

<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

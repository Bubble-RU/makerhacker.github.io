<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: I got an email from a promoter for  Predictive Analytics World , a very expensive conference next month in San Francisco for business applications of data mining / machine learning / predictive analytics.  I’m not going because I don’t want to spend $1600 of my own money, but it looks like it has a good lineup and all (Andreas Weigend, Netflix BellKor folks, case studies from interesting companies like Linden Labs, etc.).  If you’re a cs/statistics person and want a job, this is probably a good place to meet people.  If you’re a businessman and want to hire one, this is probably a bad event since it’s too damn expensive for grad school types.  I am supposed to have access to a promotional code for a 15% discount, so email me if you want such a thing.
 
John Langford posted a  very interesting email interview  with one of the organizers for the event, about how machine learning gets applied in the real world.  The guy seemed to think that data integration — getting all the data out of d</p><p>4 0.10766757 <a title="191-tfidf-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2011/brendan_oconnor_ai-2011-03-02-Poor_man%E2%80%99s_linear_algebra_textbook.html">166 brendan oconnor ai-2011-03-02-Poor man’s linear algebra textbook</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Lukas  and I were trying to write a succinct comparison of the most popular packages that are typically used for data analysis.  I think most people choose one based on what people around them use or what they learn in school, so I’ve found it hard to find comparative information.  I’m posting the table here in hopes of useful comments.

John Langford posted a  very interesting email interview  with one of the organizers for the event, about how machine learning gets applied in the real world.  The guy seemed to think that data integration — getting all the data out of d</p><p>5 0.41503194 <a title="191-lsi-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-03-21-Statistics_is_big-N_logic%3F.html">54 brendan oconnor ai-2007-03-21-Statistics is big-N logic?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I think I believe one of these things, but I’m not quite sure. 
 Statistics is just like logic, except with uncertainty. 
 
This would be true if statistics is Bayesian statistics and you buy the Bayesian inductive logic story — add induction to propositional logic, via a conditional credibility operator, and the Cox axioms imply standard probability theory as a consequence.  (That is, probability theory is logic with uncertainty.  And then a good Bayesian thinks probability theory and statistics are the same.)  Links:  Jaynes’ explanation ;  SEP article ; also  Fitelson’s article .  (Though there are negative results; all I can think of right now is a  Halpern  article on Cox; and also interesting is  Halpern and Koller .)
 
Secondly, here is another statement.
  

Statistics is just like logic, except with a big N.

  
This is a more data-driven view — the world is full of things and they need to be described.  Logical rules can help you describe things, but you also have to deal wit</p><p>6 0.395619 <a title="191-lsi-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-05-23-Sub-reddit_for_Systems_Science_and_OR.html">104 brendan oconnor ai-2008-05-23-Sub-reddit for Systems Science and OR</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I previously  posted  two neuroeconomics reviews.   Here’s a new one from this year  in Trends in Cognitive Sciences.  It’s interesting because not only does it look at using psychological knowledge to inform economics, but it also reviews work in the other direction: using economic decision and organizational theory to study brain systems.  For example,   here’s a paper  that analyzes brain reward circuitry using labor supply theory.

<p>Introduction: Larry Wasserman has a new position paper (forthcoming 2013) with a great comparison the Statistics and Machine Learning research cultures,  “Rise of the Machines” .  He has a very conciliatory view in terms of intellectual content, and a very pro-ML take on the research cultures.  Central to his argument is that ML has recently adopted rigorous statistical concepts, and the fast-moving conference culture (and heavy publishing by its grad students) have helped with this and other good innovations.  (I agree with a comment from Sinead that he’s going a little easy on ML, but it’s certainly worth a read.)
 
There’s now a little history of “Statistics vs Machine Learning” position papers that this can be compared to.  A classic is Leo Breiman (2001),  “Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures” , which isn’t exactly about stats vs. ML, but is about the focus on modeling vs algorithms, and maybe about description vs. prediction.

<p>Introduction: Herbert Gintis thinks  it’s time to unify the behavioral sciences. Sociology, economics, political science, human biology, anthropology and others all study the same thing, but each is based on different incompatible models of individual human behavior. There seems to be evidence that new developments have the potential to offer a more unifying theory. Evolutionary biology should be the basis of understanding much of human behavior. Rational choice and game theoretic frameworks are finding greater acceptance beyond economics; in the meantime, other fields need to absorb sociology’s emphasis on socialization — that people do things or understand the world in a way taught by society. The human behavioral sciences are still rife with many smaller inconsistencies; for example, according to Gintis, only anthropolgists look at the influence of culture across groups, but only sociologists look at culture within groups.
 
Gintis’ ultimate goal is to have a common baseline from which each disci</p><p>4 0.54257685 <a title="191-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-12-03-Statistics_vs._Machine_Learning%2C_fight%21.html">129 brendan oconnor ai-2008-12-03-Statistics vs. Machine Learning, fight!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: [Like medieval Christian societies,] Islamic societies similarly found ingenious ways to circumvent the usury ban.  The primary one was the  double sale .  In this transaction, the borrower would get, for example, both 100 dinars cash and a small piece of cloth valued at the absurdly high price of 15 dinars.  In a year he would have to pay back 100 dinars for the loan of the cash and 15 for the cloth.  These debts were upheld by Sharia courts.
  
The cognition of rules and ethics sure is complex.  I’d love to read the reasoning from those courts.
 
From from Gregory Clark’s  rather intense review  of  Avner Greif ‘s new-ish book on institutional economics.  (Clark’s the one who wrote that  interesting but weird  evolutionary argument about European economic development.)  If you’re in to the little worlds of institutional, evolutionary, and behavioral economics, Greif’s work is really interesting.  Along with other institutional (or is it neo-institutional?) economists, he works to und</p><p>6 0.40705648 <a title="191-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2004/brendan_oconnor_ai-2004-11-24-addiction_%26_2_problems_of_economics.html">2 brendan oconnor ai-2004-11-24-addiction & 2 problems of economics</a></p>

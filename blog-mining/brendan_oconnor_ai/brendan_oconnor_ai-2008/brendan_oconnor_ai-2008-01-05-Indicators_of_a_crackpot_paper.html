<p>Introduction: The current subtitle is “where {political, social, economic} crosses {cognition, behavior, systems}”.  Amusingly enough, this syntax on a unix shell actually gets you the 9 combinations:
  ~% echo {political,social,economic}{cognition,behavior,systems}
politicalcognition politicalbehavior politicalsystems
socialcognition socialbehavior socialsystems economiccognition
economicbehavior economicsystems  
Tossing together groups of words is a good thing, since unexpected phrases suggest unexpected meanings.

<p>Introduction: Everyone recently seems to be talking about  this newish paper by Digrazia, McKelvey, Bollen, and Rojas  ( pdf here ) that examines the correlation of Congressional candidate name mentions on Twitter against whether the candidate won the race.  One of the coauthors also wrote a Washington Post  Op-Ed  about it.  I read the paper and I think it’s reasonable, but their op-ed overstates their results.  It claims:
  
“In the 2010 data, our Twitter data predicted the winner in 404 out of 435 competitive races”
  
But this analysis is nowhere in their paper.  Fabio Rojas has now  posted errata/rebuttals  about the op-ed and described this analysis they did here.  There are several major issues off the bat:
  
 They didn’t ever predict 404/435 races; they only analyzed 406 races they call “competitive,” getting 92.5% (in-sample) accuracy, then extrapolated to all races to get the 435 number.

<p>Introduction: I laugh out loud every time I reread  Cosma Shalizi’s review of “New Kind of Science”  (2005).  I remember reading it back in college when everyone was talking about the book, when I was just losing my naivete about the popular science treatments of complex systems and such.  I must be getting more cynical as I get older because I keep liking the review more.  This time my favorite line was
  
Wolfram even goes on to refute post-modernism on this basis; I won’t touch that except to say that I’d have paid a lot to see Wolfram and Jacques Derrida go one-on-one.
  
And on the issue of running your own conventions and citing yourself, he compares it to
  
… the way George Lakoff uses “as cognitive science shows” to mean “as I claimed in my earlier books”

<p>Introduction: The best bit from a paper by  Paul Rubin on evolution and politics : libertarianism could be unpopular today because libertarian societies would get destroyed in competition with egalitarian militaristic tribes back in the hunter-gatherer days.   The paper has some great points on what prehistoric society was like — fierce intergroup wars and competition.   Hobbes/Locke/Rousseau states of nature, not so much.  (While we’re at it, I have to plug Boyd and Richerson’s  gene-culture coevolution  theory.)
 
Evolutionary psychology has of course its  own special dangers , but apparently Rubin also wrote a book on the subject of the  biological basis of politics .

<p>Introduction: Here’s a re-plotting of a graph in  this 538 post .  It’s looking at whether pilots speed up the flight when there’s a delay, and find that it looks like that’s the case.  This is averaged data for flights on several major transcontinental routes.
 
I’ve replotted the main graph as follows.  The x-axis is departure delay.  The y-axis is the total trip time — number of minutes since the scheduled departure time.  For an on-time departure, the average flight is 5 hours, 44 minutes.  The blue line shows what the total trip time would be if the delayed flight took that long.  Gray lines are uncertainty (I think the CI due to averaging).
 
   
 
What’s going on is, the pilots seem to be targeting a total trip time of 370-380 minutes or so.  If the departure is only slightly delayed by 10 minutes, the flight time is still the same, but delays in the 30-50 minutes range see a faster flight time which makes up for some of the delay.

<p>Introduction: From Scott Aaronson:  Ten Signs a Claimed Mathematical Breakthrough is Wrong .
 
I’ve often wondered how to decide whether a paper or book is worth my time to read.  People who like a certain paper or book can always tell me that I shouldn’t judge it until I read it.  But I need some estimate of its quality/creativity/interestingness before I start.  I’ve decided to be biased towards shorter things and more well-known things.  I don’t see any good alternative, unfortunately.</p><p>2 0.20766655 <a title="88-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-11-12-Disease_tracking_with_web_queries_and_social_messaging_%28Google%2C_Twitter%2C_Facebook%E2%80%A6%29.html">123 brendan oconnor ai-2008-11-12-Disease tracking with web queries and social messaging (Google, Twitter, Facebook…)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a good idea: in a search engine’s query logs, look for outbreaks of queries like [[flu symptoms]] in a given region.  I’ve heard (from  Roddy ) that this trick also works well on Facebook statuses (e.g. “Feeling crappy this morning, think I just got the flu”).
  
  Google Uses Web Searches to Track Flu’s Spread – NYTimes.com  
  Google Flu Trends – google.org  
  
For an example with a publicly available data feed, these queries works decently well on Twitter search:
 
 [[ flu -shot -google ]]  (high recall)
 
 [[ "muscle aches" flu -shot ]]  (high precision)
     
 
The “muscle aches” query is too sparse and the general query is too noisy, but you could imagine some more tricks to clean it up, then train a classifier, etc.  With a bit more work it looks like geolocation information can be had out of the  Twitter search API .</p><p>3 0.20248725 <a title="88-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2014/brendan_oconnor_ai-2014-02-19-What_the_ACL-2014_review_scores_mean.html">203 brendan oconnor ai-2014-02-19-What the ACL-2014 review scores mean</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve had several people ask me what the numbers in  ACL  reviews mean — and I can’t find anywhere online where they’re described.  (Can anyone point this out if it is somewhere?)
 
So here’s the review form, below.  They all go from 1 to 5, with 5 the best.  I think the review emails to authors only include a subset of the below — for example, “Overall Recommendation” is not included?
 
The CFP said that they have different types of review forms for different types of papers.  I think this one is for a standard full paper.  I guess what people  really  want to know is what scores tend to correspond to acceptances.  I really have no idea and I get the impression this can change year to year.  I have no involvement with the ACL conference besides being one of many, many reviewers.
 
  
  
APPROPRIATENESS (1-5)
Does the paper fit in ACL 2014? (Please answer this question in light of the desire to broaden the scope of the research areas represented at ACL.) 

5: Certainly.

<p>Introduction: I don’t care how lame anyone thinks this is, but economic theorist  Ariel Rubinstein  is the shit.  He’s funny, self-deprecating, and brilliant.  I was just re-reading  his delightful, sarcastic review of Freakonomics .  (Overly dramatized visual depiction below; hey, conflict sells.)
 
    The review consists of excerpts from his own upcoming super-worldwide-bestseller, “Freak-Freakonomics”.  It is full of golden quotes such as: 
  Chapter 2: Why do economists earn more than mathematicians?  
 
…
 
The comparison between architects and prostitutes can be applied to mathematicians and economists: The former are more skilled, highly educated and intelligent.  
 
To elaborate: 
 Levitt has never encountered a girl who dreams of being a prostitute and I have never met a child who dreams of being an economist. Like prostitutes, the skill required of economists is “not necessarily ‘specialized’” (106). And, finally, here is a new explanation for the salary gap between mathematicians and eco</p><p>5 0.19980472 <a title="88-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-09-02-cognitive_modelling_is_rational_choice%2B%2B.html">26 brendan oconnor ai-2005-09-02-cognitive modelling is rational choice++</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rational choice has been a huge imperialistic success, growing in popularity and being applied to more and more fields.  Why is this?  It’s not because the rational choice model of decision-making is particularly realistic.  Rather, it’s because rational choice is a  completely specified theory of human behavior , and therefore is great at generating hypotheses.  Given any situation involving people, rational choice can be used to generate a hypothesis about what to expect.  That is, you just ask, “What would a person do to maximize their own benefit?”
 
Similar things have been said about evolutionary psychology: you can always predict behavior by asking “what would hunter-gatherers do?”  Now, certainly both rational choice and evolutionary psychology don’t always generate  correct  hypotheses, but they’re incredibly useful because they at least give you a starting point.
 
Witness the theory of bounded rationality: just like rational choice, except amended to consider computational l</p><p>6 0.19906844 <a title="88-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-06-05-Clinton-Obama_support_visualization.html">105 brendan oconnor ai-2008-06-05-Clinton-Obama support visualization</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Great Microsoft Research report (from a workshop they held?):   2020 Science  where they argue that computer  science  will become part and parcel of science in general.  For example, computation theory will be important to understand biological organisms as information processing systems.  This is basically a much better version of Wolfram’s  New Kind of Science  argument — I believe this one.  The big shared insight is that computers aren’t just about data storage and number crunching.  Wolfram and the some of the Santa Fe complex systems people are really in to simulations, which is fine.  But there’s tremendous potential in computation  theory  — algorithms, formal representations, and more.  Empirical scientists are going to have to learn this stuff!</p><p>3 0.077906728 <a title="119-tfidf-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-01-02-The_Jungle_Economy.html">47 brendan oconnor ai-2007-01-02-The Jungle Economy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I wish I knew Hebrew .  Well, fortunately there is also an English article version of  Equilibrium in the Jungle  (Piccione and Rubinstein ’06): 
 In the typical analysis of an exchange economy, agents are involved in consumption and exchange goods voluntarily when mutually beneficial. The endowments and the preferences are the primitives of the model. The distribution of consumption in society is determined endogenously through trade.  
 
This paper is motivated by a complementary perspective on human interaction. Throughout the history of mankind, it has been quite common (and we suspect that it will remain so in the future) that economic agents, individually or collectively, use power to seize control of assets held by others.  The exercise of power is pervasive in every society and takes several forms. Often, power is purely physical. Sometimes, however, power is more gentle.  In the male-female “market”, for example, charm and attraction play a key role in obtaining a favourite ma</p><p>4 0.073018789 <a title="119-tfidf-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2010/brendan_oconnor_ai-2010-11-09-Greenspan_on_the_Daily_Show.html">162 brendan oconnor ai-2010-11-09-Greenspan on the Daily Show</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I love this  Daily Show clip with Alan Greenspan .  On emotion and economic forecasting.  From 2007.
 
   
  
GREENSPAN: 
I’ve been dealing with these big mathematical models of forecasting the economy, and I’m looking at what’s going on in the last few weeks. … If I could figure out a way to determine whether or not people are more fearful or changing to more euphoric … I don’t need any of this other stuff.  I could forecast the economy better than any way I know.


The trouble is that we can’t figure that out. I’ve been in the forecasting business for 50 years. … I’m no better than I ever was, and nobody else is. Forecasting 50 years ago was as good or as bad as it is today. And the reason is that human nature hasn’t changed. We can’t improve ourselves.”

<p>Introduction: Herbert Gintis thinks  it’s time to unify the behavioral sciences. Sociology, economics, political science, human biology, anthropology and others all study the same thing, but each is based on different incompatible models of individual human behavior. There seems to be evidence that new developments have the potential to offer a more unifying theory. Evolutionary biology should be the basis of understanding much of human behavior. Rational choice and game theoretic frameworks are finding greater acceptance beyond economics; in the meantime, other fields need to absorb sociology’s emphasis on socialization — that people do things or understand the world in a way taught by society. The human behavioral sciences are still rife with many smaller inconsistencies; for example, according to Gintis, only anthropolgists look at the influence of culture across groups, but only sociologists look at culture within groups.
 
Gintis’ ultimate goal is to have a common baseline from which each disci</p><p>6 0.054731872 <a title="119-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-03-15-Computability_and_induction_and_ideal_rationality_and_the_simpsons.html">52 brendan oconnor ai-2007-03-15-Computability and induction and ideal rationality and the simpsons</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Don’t have time to read much right now, but received word about a neat-looking paper:  Uncomputability: The Problem of Induction Internalized  by Kevin Kelly.
 
Kevin Kelly’s website has an awesome statement that mirrors thoughts I’ve been having for the last few years — the incredible importance of computational constraints applied to reasoning and rationality:
  
Kuhn teaches that a single, deep success suffices to keep a competing paradign on the table.  Not surprisingly, computational learning theory shows its superiority over ideal theories of rationality when we trade in our ideal agents for more realistic, computable agents.  The foundation of the deep success is a strong structural analogy between the halting problem and the problem of inductive generalization, allowing for a unified treatment of both, from the ground up.  One consequence of the approach is that one can often show that computable agents are forced to choose between ideal rationality and finding the right answer</p><p>4 0.38822573 <a title="119-lsi-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-03-15-Feminists%2C_anarchists%2C_computational_complexity%2C_bounded_rationality%2C_nethack%2C_and_other_things_to_do.html">53 brendan oconnor ai-2007-03-15-Feminists, anarchists, computational complexity, bounded rationality, nethack, and other things to do</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was planning to write some  WordNet  lookup code tonight.  But instead I’ve learned of too many intersecting things.
 
First, there are a zillion things to do this weekend ( hooray flavorpill ):
 
  Picasso and American Art  exhibit continuing at  SFMOMA .  I saw it very briefly last weekend but want some more.  And Doug claims there’s an interesting photography exhibit there too.
  Reading from  We Don’t Need Another Wave: Dispatches from the Next Generation of Feminists , a fascinating looking book I’ve seen many times in the bookstores around here.  By that I mean at least Modern Times (the neat Mission bookstore) and the Anarchist Collective Bookstore (out on the Haight).  And the reading is at Modern Times,  just down the street  from my house!  Amazing.  Tomorrow at 7:30.
  Since anarchists were just mentioned, fortuitously there also appears: the  Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair  this Saturday and Sunday!  Speakers and books down by Golden Gate Park, oh my.

Volatility frequently occurs when everyone suddenly realizes the stock market is just a consensual mass delusion based on fictitious valuings of abstract assets.


It’s like finding out Santa Claus is real because you catch him robbing your house.
  
I wonder what a derivatives market is by that analogy.Â   $596 trillion  worth of hypothetical presents?</p><p>2 0.93309093 <a title="119-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2006/brendan_oconnor_ai-2006-07-25-Two_Middle_East_politics_visualizations.html">42 brendan oconnor ai-2006-07-25-Two Middle East politics visualizations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: These are both useful summaries.  Slate has a  chart of relationships  between Hamas, Hezbollah, Israel, and Lebanon, versus a number of different actors in the region.  NYTimes has  something similar on a map , also showing the sizes of ethnic/religious groups.  Seems the NYTimes is most interesting as far as visualization/graphic design goes.  It also has rich relational information and lots of predicates: does group X have oil wealth?  is group X in the government of country Y?  Etc.  Seems ripe for a  relational concept-learning clustering analysisâ&euro;Ś

<p>Introduction: Great Microsoft Research report (from a workshop they held?):   2020 Science  where they argue that computer  science  will become part and parcel of science in general.  For example, computation theory will be important to understand biological organisms as information processing systems.  This is basically a much better version of Wolfram’s  New Kind of Science  argument — I believe this one.  The big shared insight is that computers aren’t just about data storage and number crunching.  Wolfram and the some of the Santa Fe complex systems people are really in to simulations, which is fine.  But there’s tremendous potential in computation  theory  — algorithms, formal representations, and more.  Empirical scientists are going to have to learn this stuff!</p><p>4 0.045582861 <a title="119-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2010/brendan_oconnor_ai-2010-11-09-Greenspan_on_the_Daily_Show.html">162 brendan oconnor ai-2010-11-09-Greenspan on the Daily Show</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I love this  Daily Show clip with Alan Greenspan .  On emotion and economic forecasting.  From 2007.
 
   
  
GREENSPAN: 
I’ve been dealing with these big mathematical models of forecasting the economy, and I’m looking at what’s going on in the last few weeks. … If I could figure out a way to determine whether or not people are more fearful or changing to more euphoric … I don’t need any of this other stuff.  I could forecast the economy better than any way I know.


The trouble is that we can’t figure that out. I’ve been in the forecasting business for 50 years. … I’m no better than I ever was, and nobody else is. Forecasting 50 years ago was as good or as bad as it is today. And the reason is that human nature hasn’t changed. We can’t improve ourselves.”


STEWART: 
You just bummed the [bleep] out of me.

<p>Introduction: Herbert Gintis thinks  it’s time to unify the behavioral sciences. Sociology, economics, political science, human biology, anthropology and others all study the same thing, but each is based on different incompatible models of individual human behavior. There seems to be evidence that new developments have the potential to offer a more unifying theory. Evolutionary biology should be the basis of understanding much of human behavior. Rational choice and game theoretic frameworks are finding greater acceptance beyond economics; in the meantime, other fields need to absorb sociology’s emphasis on socialization — that people do things or understand the world in a way taught by society. The human behavioral sciences are still rife with many smaller inconsistencies; for example, according to Gintis, only anthropolgists look at the influence of culture across groups, but only sociologists look at culture within groups.
 
Gintis’ ultimate goal is to have a common baseline from which each disci</p><p>6 0.034618091 <a title="119-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2006/brendan_oconnor_ai-2006-04-24-The_identity_politics_of_satananic_zombie_alien_man-beasts.html">33 brendan oconnor ai-2006-04-24-The identity politics of satananic zombie alien man-beasts</a></p>

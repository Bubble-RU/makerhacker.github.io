<p>Introduction: I’ve been reading several somewhat recent finance papers ( Antweiler and Frank 2005 ,  Das and Chen 2007 ) that use  Rainbow , the text classification software originally written by  Andrew McCallum  back in 1996.  The last version is from 2002 and the homepage announces he isn’t really supporting it any more.
 
However, as far as I can tell, it might still be the easiest-to-use text classifier package out there.  You don’t have to program — just invoke commandline arguments — and it can accommodate reasonably sized datasets, does tokenization, stopword filtering, etc. for you, and has some useful feature selection and other options.  Based on my limited usage, it seems well-implemented.  If anyone knows of a better one I’d love to hear it.  I once looked at, among other things,  GATE  and  UIMA , and they seemed too hard to use if you wanted to download something that did simple text classification; or else, maybe they didn’t have documentation on how to use them in that manner.

<p>Introduction: What freely available end-to-end natural language processing (NLP) systems are out there, that start with raw text, and output parses and semantic structures?  Lots of NLP research focuses on single tasks at a time, and thus produces software that does a single task at a time.  But for various applications, it is nicer to have a full end-to-end system that just runs on whatever text you give it.
 
If you believe this is a worthwhile goal (see caveat at bottom), I will postulate there aren’t a ton of such end-to-end, multilevel systems.  Here are ones I can think of.  Corrections and clarifications welcome.
  
  Stanford CoreNLP .  Raw text to  rich syntactic dependencies  ( LFG -inspired).  Also POS, NER, coreference. 
  C&C; tools .  From (sentence-segmented, tokenized?) text to rich syntactic dependencies ( CCG -based) and also a semantic representation.  POS and chunks on the way.  Does anyone use this much?  It seems underappreciated relative to its richness.

<p>Introduction: This is off-topic for this blog but here goes.   ConnectU , a small college social networking site, has been in the news due to their  apparently weak lawsuit against Facebook , in which they claim  Mark Zuckerberg  stole their business plan and computer code back when they all were Harvard undergraduates.  (Judges involved have noted the case’s flimsy evidence; some technology commentators — as well as everyone I know — have noted that the business idea wasn’t all that brilliant or original in the first place.)  Zuckerberg, of course, went on to found Facebook and bring it to incredible success.
 
I tried to use the ConnectU site recently, but got an error when searching for a funny name with an apostrophe,  o’connor .  It turns out this was symptomatic of a very grave security flaw in their code, an  SQL injection vulnerability .  While Facebook recently had  a minor security-related glitch , ConnectU’s flaw is far more serious.  A malicious attacker could use this to easily break in</p><p>6 0.052122999 <a title="97-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2012/brendan_oconnor_ai-2012-02-02-Histograms_%E2%80%94_matplotlib_vs._R.html">179 brendan oconnor ai-2012-02-02-Histograms — matplotlib vs. R</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I’m looking for recommendations for a good textbook/handbook/reference on (non-formal) linguistic semantics. Â My undergrad semantics course was almost entirely focused on logical/formal semantics, which is fine, but I don’t feel familiar with the breadth of substantive issues — for example, I’d be hard-pressed to explain why something like semantic/thematic role labeling should be useful for anything at all.
 
I somewhat randomly stumbled upon  Frawley 1992  ( review ) in a  used bookstore  and it seemed pretty good — in particular, it cleanly separates itself from the philosophical study of semantics, and thus identifies issues that seem amenable to computational modeling.
 
I’m wondering what else is out there?

<p>Introduction: Lukas  and I were trying to write a succinct comparison of the most popular packages that are typically used for data analysis.  I think most people choose one based on what people around them use or what they learn in school, so I’ve found it hard to find comparative information.  I’m posting the table here in hopes of useful comments.

<p>Introduction: Like everyone, I’ve been just starting to look at the new, tentative,  proof that P != NP  from Vinay Deolalikar.  After reading the intro, what’s most striking is that probabilistic graphical models and mathematical logic are at the core of the proof.  This feels like a machine learning and artificial intelligence-centric approach to me — very different from what you usually see in mainstream CS theory.  (Maybe I should feel good that in my undergrad I basically stopped studying normal math and spent all my time with this weird stuff instead!)
 
He devotes several chapters to an introduction to graphical models — Ising models, conditional independence, MRF’s, Hammersley-Clifford, and all that other stuff you see in  Koller and Friedman  or something — and then logic and model theory!  I’m impressed.</p><p>2 0.9726603 <a title="97-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-09-30-PalinSpeak.com.html">114 brendan oconnor ai-2008-09-30-PalinSpeak.com</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With my friend  Doug , I just finished making a game —   PalinSpeak.com   —  where you can chat with a Sarah Palin simulator.  Check it out, it’s the best thing to hit the Internet since sliced bread.

<p>Introduction: I’ve gotten a zillion emails about it by now, but it was recently found that a young woman had been living for a year in Stanford dorms claiming to be a freshman, when in fact she was not a student of any sort at all.  This seems to have engendered much discussion in the Stanford community, e.g.  here .  (The  LA Times  has a decent piece).
 
I mostly think the story is just sad, but a few thoughts:
 
 The security scare angle is a bit ridiculous, as is the blame game being played.
  I suspect the Stanford community is naive and high-strung about these things.  My friends who went to state schools say things like this happen all the time.  Besides, staffs in co-ops are sometimes happy to let vagrants hang out.  The motivations for and mechanics of her deception are clearly the important part of this story (e.g.  how did she live with herself? )
  Her first two quarters were in Kimball, then then her last quarter was in Okada.  I’m surprised the Kimball staff weren’t enough in-touch wit</p><p>same-blog 4 0.92747557 <a title="97-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-03-24-Quick-R%2C_the_only_decent_R_documentation_on_the_internet.html">97 brendan oconnor ai-2008-03-24-Quick-R, the only decent R documentation on the internet</a></p>

I really love R, but it has horrid documentation and a steep learning curve.  Recently I was introduced to  Quick-R , a really excellent documentation site.

<p>Introduction: It’s been a good year.  Last fall I started a master’s program in the Language Technologies department at  CMU SCS , taking some great classes, hanging out with a  cool lab , and writing two new papers (for  ICWSM , involving Twitter:  polls  and  tweetmotif ; also did some  coref  work, financial text regression stuff, and looked at  social lexicography .)  I also applied to CS and stats PhD programs at several universities.  Next year I’ll be starting the PhD program in the  Machine Learning Department  here at CMU.
 
I’m excited!  Just the other day I was looking at videos on my old hard drive and found a presentation by  Tom Mitchell  on “the Discipline of Machine Learning” that I downloaded back in 2007 or so.  (Can’t find it online right now, but  this is similar .)  That might be where I heard of the department first.  Maybe some day I will be smarter than the guy who wrote  this rant  (though I am much more pro-stats and anti-ML these days…).
 
Also, I was recently named a fina</p><p>6 0.42202079 <a title="97-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-12-03-Statistics_vs._Machine_Learning%2C_fight%21.html">129 brendan oconnor ai-2008-12-03-Statistics vs. Machine Learning, fight!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: re  @andrewparker :
  
 My iPhone auto-corrected “Harvard” to “Garbage”. Well played Apple engineers. 
  
I was wondering how this would happen, and then noticed that each character pair has 0 to 2 distance on the QWERTY keyboard.  Perhaps their model is eager to allow QWERTY-local character substitutions.
  
 
>>> zip(‘harvard’,'garbage’) 
[('h', 'g'), ('a', 'a'), ('r', 'r'), ('v', 'b'), ('a', 'a'), ('r', 'g'), ('d', 'e')]
 
  
And then most any language model thinks p(“garbage”) > p(“harvard”), at the very least in a unigram model with a broad domain corpus.  So if it’s a noisy channel-style model, they’re underpenalizing the edit distance relative to the LM prior.  (Reference:  Norvig’s noisy channel spelling correction article .)
 
On the other hand, given how  insane iPhone autocorrections are , and from the number of times I’ve seen it delete a quite reasonable word I wrote, I’d bet “harvard” isn’t even in their LM.  (Where the LM is more like just a dictionary; call it quantizin</p><p>4 0.092214592 <a title="108-tfidf-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2013/brendan_oconnor_ai-2013-08-31-Probabilistic_interpretation_of_the_B3_coreference_resolution_metric.html">199 brendan oconnor ai-2013-08-31-Probabilistic interpretation of the B3 coreference resolution metric</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here is an intuitive justification for the  B3  evaluation metric often used in coreference resolution, based on whether mention pairs are coreferent. If a mention from the document is chosen at random,
  
 B3-Recall is the (expected) proportion of its actual coreferents that the system thinks are coreferent with it. 
 B3-Precision is the (expected) proportion of its system-hypothesized coreferents that are actually coreferent with it. 
  
Does this look correct to people? Details below:  
 
In B3′s basic form, it’s a clustering evaluation metric, to evaluate a gold-standard clustering of mentions against a system-produced clustering of mentions.
 
Let \(G\) mean a gold-standard entity and \(S\) mean a system-predicted entity, where an entity is a set of mentions. \(i\)Â refers to a mention; there are \(n\) mentions in the document. \(G_i\) means the gold entity that contains mention \(i\); and \(S_i\) means the system entity that has \(i\).

<p>Introduction: I should make a blog where all I do is scatterplot results tables from papers.  I do this once in a while to make them eaiser to understand…
 
I think the following are results are from Yee Whye Teh’s paper on hierarchical Pitman-Yor language models, and in particular comparing them to Kneser-Ney and hierarchical Dirichlets.  They’re specifically from  these slides by Yee Whye Teh (page 25) , which shows model perplexities.  Every dot is for one experimental condition, which has four different results from each of the models.  So a pair of models can be compared in one scatterplot.

   ikn = interpolated kneser-ney
    mkn = modified kneser-ney
    hdlm = hierarchical dirichlet
    hpylm = hierarchical pitman-yor
   
My reading: the KN’s and HPYLM are incredibly similar (as Teh argues should be the case on theoretical grounds).  MKN and HPYLM edge out IKN.  HDLM is markedly worse (this is perplexity, so lower is better).

<p>Introduction: Here’s a re-plotting of a graph in  this 538 post .  It’s looking at whether pilots speed up the flight when there’s a delay, and find that it looks like that’s the case.  This is averaged data for flights on several major transcontinental routes.
 
I’ve replotted the main graph as follows.  The x-axis is departure delay.  The y-axis is the total trip time — number of minutes since the scheduled departure time.  For an on-time departure, the average flight is 5 hours, 44 minutes.  The blue line shows what the total trip time would be if the delayed flight took that long.  Gray lines are uncertainty (I think the CI due to averaging).
 
   
 
What’s going on is, the pilots seem to be targeting a total trip time of 370-380 minutes or so.  If the departure is only slightly delayed by 10 minutes, the flight time is still the same, but delays in the 30-50 minutes range see a faster flight time which makes up for some of the delay.

<p>Introduction: (Update 10/2008: actually this model doesn’t work in all cases.Â   In the final paper  we use an (even) simpler model.)
 
I really don’t have time to write up an explanation for what this is so I’ll just post the graph instead.  Each box is a scatterplot of an AMT worker’s responses versus a gold standard.  Drawn are attempts to fit linear models to each worker.  The idea is to correct for the biases of each worker.  With a linear model y ~ ax+b, the correction is correction(y) = (y-b)/a.  Arrows show such corrections.  Hilariously bad “corrections” happen.  *But*, there is also weighting: to get the “correct” answer (maximum likelihood) from several workers, you weight by a^2/stddev^2.  Despite the sometimes odd corrections, the cross-validated results from this model correlate better with the gold than the raw averaging of workers.  (Raw averaging is the maximum likelihood solution for a fixed noise model: a=1, b=0, and each worker’s variance is equal).
 
Much better explanation is c</p><p>2 0.24389769 <a title="108-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2013/brendan_oconnor_ai-2013-08-20-Some_analysis_of_tweet_shares_and_%E2%80%9Cpredicting%E2%80%9D_election_outcomes.html">198 brendan oconnor ai-2013-08-20-Some analysis of tweet shares and “predicting” election outcomes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Everyone recently seems to be talking about  this newish paper by Digrazia, McKelvey, Bollen, and Rojas  ( pdf here ) that examines the correlation of Congressional candidate name mentions on Twitter against whether the candidate won the race.  One of the coauthors also wrote a Washington Post  Op-Ed  about it.  I read the paper and I think it’s reasonable, but their op-ed overstates their results.  It claims:
  
“In the 2010 data, our Twitter data predicted the winner in 404 out of 435 competitive races”
  
But this analysis is nowhere in their paper.  Fabio Rojas has now  posted errata/rebuttals  about the op-ed and described this analysis they did here.  There are several major issues off the bat:
  
 They didn’t ever predict 404/435 races; they only analyzed 406 races they call “competitive,” getting 92.5% (in-sample) accuracy, then extrapolated to all races to get the 435 number. 
 They’re reporting about  in-sample  predictions, which is really misleading to a non-scientific audi</p><p>3 0.23814146 <a title="108-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-12-03-Statistics_vs._Machine_Learning%2C_fight%21.html">129 brendan oconnor ai-2008-12-03-Statistics vs. Machine Learning, fight!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: I’m a bit late blogging this, but here’s a messy, exciting — and statistically validated! — new online data source.
 
My friend  Roddy  at Facebook  wrote a post describing their sentiment analysis system , which can evaluate positive or negative sentiment toward a particular topic by looking at a large number of wall messages.  (I’d link to it, but I can’t find the URL anymore — here’s the  Lexicon , but that version only gets term frequencies but no sentiment.)
 
How they constructed their sentiment detector is interesting.  Starting with a list of positive and negative terms, they had a lexical acquisition step to gather many more candidate synonyms and misspellings — a necessity in this social media domain, where  WordNet  ain’t gonna come close!  After manually filtering these candidates, they assess the sentiment toward a mention of a topic by looking for instances of these positive and negative words nearby, along with “negation heuristics” and a few other features.

<p>Introduction: There was an  interesting ICML paper  this year about very large-scale training of deep belief networks (a.k.a. neural networks) for unsupervised concept extraction from images.  They ( Quoc V. Le  and colleagues at Google/Stanford) have a cute example of learning very high-level features that are evoked by images of cats (from YouTube still-image training data); one is shown below.
 
For those of us who work on machine learning and text, the question always comes up, why not DBN’s for language?  Many shallow latent-space text models have been quite successful (LSI, LDA, HMM, LPCFG…); there is hope that some sort of “deeper” concepts could be learned.  I think this is one of the most interesting areas for unsupervised language modeling right now.
 
But note it’s a bad idea to directly analogize results from image analysis to language analysis.  The problems have radically different levels of conceptual abstraction baked-in.  Consider the problem of detecting the concept of a cat; i.e.</p><p>6 0.2240757 <a title="108-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2004/brendan_oconnor_ai-2004-11-24-addiction_%26_2_problems_of_economics.html">2 brendan oconnor ai-2004-11-24-addiction & 2 problems of economics</a></p>

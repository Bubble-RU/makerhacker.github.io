</p><p>6 Well, maybe this is an argument to use rolling averages over a fixed number of days or something. [sent-11, score-0.245]
</p><p>7 Every poll is taken over a range of days and the table says how many respondents there were, so I did a day-by-day calculation: take the weighted average of all polls on that day, assuming that a poll’s responses were evenly distributed over its date range given. [sent-14, score-1.506]
</p><p>8 (The weighted average across the day’s polls just means, it’s as if on that day there was one big poll and we’re just calculating the Obama vs McCain percentages for it. [sent-15, score-1.084]
</p><p>9 )  And to further clean things up, I omitted polls that had “Don’t plan to vote” numbers and only included ones with undecideds. [sent-16, score-0.276]

</p><p>11 )  I know I just argued smoothing is bad and now I’m doing it, but note that the time resolution for this polling data is only at the day-by-day level, so I’m not doing any smoothing across time windows. [sent-20, score-1.707]
</p><p>12 On the perils of smoothing or not — below is  Gallup’s graph from their daily tracking poll , which uses a 3-day rolling average. [sent-25, score-1.122]
</p><p>13 But below that are two graphs from  Alan Abramowitz, attacking the day-by-day interpretations out there  — the left shows daily with no smoothing, but the right is with a 10-day rolling average. [sent-26, score-0.463]
</p><p>14 The Huffington Post article claims the 10-day one is the safest to interpret — surely the single-day one seems too noisy — but honestly I think it’s hard to say what amount of smoothing is acceptable. [sent-27, score-0.695]

</p><p>18 Finally, there are interesting tie-ins between this poll methodology stuff and Mechanical Turk statistical aggregation. [sent-34, score-0.338]
</p><p>19 You can think of polling as a similar problem to data annotation: there is a true quantity out there in the world (the percentage of vote for Obama, or whether a certain email is spam or not) and annotators/polls are noisy signals somewhat reflecting that true value.

<p>Introduction: I’m a bit late blogging this, but here’s a messy, exciting — and statistically validated! — new online data source.
 
My friend  Roddy  at Facebook  wrote a post describing their sentiment analysis system , which can evaluate positive or negative sentiment toward a particular topic by looking at a large number of wall messages.  (I’d link to it, but I can’t find the URL anymore — here’s the  Lexicon , but that version only gets term frequencies but no sentiment.)
 
How they constructed their sentiment detector is interesting.  Starting with a list of positive and negative terms, they had a lexical acquisition step to gather many more candidate synonyms and misspellings — a necessity in this social media domain, where  WordNet  ain’t gonna come close!  After manually filtering these candidates, they assess the sentiment toward a mention of a topic by looking for instances of these positive and negative words nearby, along with “negation heuristics” and a few other features.

<p>Introduction: Everyone recently seems to be talking about  this newish paper by Digrazia, McKelvey, Bollen, and Rojas  ( pdf here ) that examines the correlation of Congressional candidate name mentions on Twitter against whether the candidate won the race.  One of the coauthors also wrote a Washington Post  Op-Ed  about it.  I read the paper and I think it’s reasonable, but their op-ed overstates their results.  It claims:
  
“In the 2010 data, our Twitter data predicted the winner in 404 out of 435 competitive races”
  
But this analysis is nowhere in their paper.  Fabio Rojas has now  posted errata/rebuttals  about the op-ed and described this analysis they did here.  There are several major issues off the bat:
  
 They didn’t ever predict 404/435 races; they only analyzed 406 races they call “competitive,” getting 92.5% (in-sample) accuracy, then extrapolated to all races to get the 435 number. 
 They’re reporting about  in-sample  predictions, which is really misleading to a non-scientific audi</p><p>4 0.084738359 <a title="111-tfidf-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-06-18-Turker_classifiers_and_binary_classification_threshold_calibration.html">107 brendan oconnor ai-2008-06-18-Turker classifiers and binary classification threshold calibration</a></p>

<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: Here’s a re-plotting of a graph in  this 538 post .  It’s looking at whether pilots speed up the flight when there’s a delay, and find that it looks like that’s the case.  This is averaged data for flights on several major transcontinental routes.
 
I’ve replotted the main graph as follows.  The x-axis is departure delay.  The y-axis is the total trip time — number of minutes since the scheduled departure time.  For an on-time departure, the average flight is 5 hours, 44 minutes.  The blue line shows what the total trip time would be if the delayed flight took that long.  Gray lines are uncertainty (I think the CI due to averaging).
 
   
 
What’s going on is, the pilots seem to be targeting a total trip time of 370-380 minutes or so.  If the departure is only slightly delayed by 10 minutes, the flight time is still the same, but delays in the 30-50 minutes range see a faster flight time which makes up for some of the delay.

<p>Introduction: R  has a fun built-in package,  datasets : a whole bunch of easy-to-use, interesting tables of data.  I found the famous UC Berkeley admissions data set, from a 1970′s study of whether sex discrimination existed in graduate admissions.  It’s famous for illustrating a particular statistical paradox.  Thanks to R’s awesome mosaic plots interface, we can see this really easily.
 
UCBAdmissions is a three-dimensional table (like a matrix): Admit Status x Gender x Dept, with counts for each category as the matrix’s values.  R’s default printing shows the basics just fine.  Here’s the data for just the first of six departments:
   >  UCBAdmissions 
, , Dept = A

          Gender
Admit      Male Female
  Admitted  512     89
  Rejected  313     19

...
 
  
Overall,  women have a lower admittance rate than men :
   >  apply(UCBAdmissions,c(1,2),sum) 

          Gender
Admit         M    F

<p>Introduction: In San Francisco, it’s no secret who everyone wanted to win in this election.  Shortly after Obama’s victory speech last night, people started celebrating in the streets near my house in the Mission.  At Valencia and 19th, a big party formed and ran for several hours into the night.
     
     
  People and kids were cheering, high-fiving, playing music, and having a good time:
 
            
 
Shades of  Burning Man : There were happy combinations of alcohol, police, art cars, fireworks, and the  Extra Action Marching Band .
 
            
 
(That clip was the tensest situation I saw; after that, the police just moved everyone out of the intersection and watched carefully.)
 
            
 
            
 
I yelled “Yes we can!” and was answered “Yes we DID!”  Strangers hugged me.  I went home at 1 a.m. and the party was still going strong.  Not the worst way to celebrate making history.

<p>Introduction: Continuing  our previous story : they’ve won!  Check out the interview at the end of the semifinals here.
 
      
 
NYT  reports : 
 ATHENS, May 20 (AP) â€” In what some fans called a stunning upset, a Finnish heavy metal band with monster masks and apocalyptic lyrics won the Eurovision Song Contest late Saturday. 
 
The band, Lordi, caused a bit of a national identity crisis in Finland, where opponents accused it of devil worship and cringed at the thought that it might win.
 
The annual kitsch extravaganza, which was the springboard for the Swedish group Abba and Celine Dion, is known for its bland dance music and bubble-gum pop acts. This year groups from 24 countries faced off before tens of millions on television.
 
The band’s members do not disclose their real names. The lead singer, Mr. Lordi, said its win, Finland’s first, was “a victory for open-mindedness.” “We are not Satanists,” he said. “This is entertainment.”</p><p>same-blog 2 0.90723985 <a title="111-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-08-16-A_better_Obama_vs_McCain_poll_aggregation.html">111 brendan oconnor ai-2008-08-16-A better Obama vs McCain poll aggregation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:  Charles Franklin (of Pollster.com) kindly emailed me with many interesting points on this post.  One important note is that my technique isn’t really “no smoothing” — rather, there is now implicit smoothing within the polling houses, by assuming that responses are evenly distributed across the time interval of the poll.
   I was looking at Pollster.com’s page that aggregates many opinion polls on the Presidential race.    Here, they have a chart   that shows the many polls plus lowess fits: 
   
 
So there’s a trend of Obama recently declining.  But it wasn’t clear to me that the fitted curve was correct.  I downloaded the data and started playing around with it.
 
Here are several more graphs I made, with different smoothing parameters for the lowess fit.  Your interpretation completely changes depending which smoothing parameter you like best!
 
   
 
Well, maybe this is an argument to use rolling averages over a fixed number of days or something.  But it would be nice to di</p><p>3 0.87966686 <a title="111-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2010/brendan_oconnor_ai-2010-03-31-How_Facebook_privacy_failed_me.html">158 brendan oconnor ai-2010-03-31-How Facebook privacy failed me</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At some point, I put extra email addresses on Facebook because I thought it was necessary for something, but didn’t want to show them, so in the privacy settings marked their visibility as “Only Me.”  It turns out that right now, Facebook is blatantly ignoring that privacy setting, and instead showing them to the world.
 
Here are my settings:
 
   
 
Here is a fragment of my profile, viewed from a friend’s account half an hour ago:
 
   
 
I would complain to their customer service, but I can’t find a link from their  Help Center  page.
 
Obviously, this particular issue is a very minor concern for me.  But it hardly instills faith in the system — especially considering that privacy bugs are ones that the affected user, almost by definition, can’t see.  I’ve also had other weird issues where changes to privacy settings don’t seem to stick when I save then later go back to the page.  It’s annoying and hard to verify these things — which is why important  “social utilities”  like Facebo</p><p>4 0.44337794 <a title="111-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2006/brendan_oconnor_ai-2006-04-24-The_identity_politics_of_satananic_zombie_alien_man-beasts.html">33 brendan oconnor ai-2006-04-24-The identity politics of satananic zombie alien man-beasts</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I thought  Eurovision  was weird enough already.  But in addition to the usual fun mix of kitschy pop and Cold War legacy nationalism in its telephone voting politics, this year will see Finland’s satanic band Lordi: 
 HELSINKI, Finland â€” They have eight-foot retractable latex Satan wings, sing hits like “Chainsaw Buffet” and blow up slabs of smoking meat on stage. So members of the band Lordi expected a reaction when they beat a crooner of love ballads to represent Finland at the Eurovision song contest in Athens, the competition that was the springboard for Abba and Celine Dion. 
 
    
 “In Finland, we have no Eiffel Tower, few real famous artists, it is freezing cold and we suffer from low self-esteem,” said Mr. Putaansuu, who, as Lordi, has horns protruding from his forehead and sports long black fingernails. 
 
As he stuck out his tongue menacingly, his red demon eyes glaring, Lordi was surrounded by Kita, an alien-man-beast predator who plays flame-spitting drums inside a cage</p><p>5 0.42413092 <a title="111-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-12-03-Statistics_vs._Machine_Learning%2C_fight%21.html">129 brendan oconnor ai-2008-12-03-Statistics vs. Machine Learning, fight!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

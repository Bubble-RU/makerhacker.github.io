<p>Introduction: There was an  interesting ICML paper  this year about very large-scale training of deep belief networks (a.k.a. neural networks) for unsupervised concept extraction from images.  They ( Quoc V. Le  and colleagues at Google/Stanford) have a cute example of learning very high-level features that are evoked by images of cats (from YouTube still-image training data); one is shown below.
 
For those of us who work on machine learning and text, the question always comes up, why not DBN’s for language?  Many shallow latent-space text models have been quite successful (LSI, LDA, HMM, LPCFG…); there is hope that some sort of “deeper” concepts could be learned.  I think this is one of the most interesting areas for unsupervised language modeling right now.
 
But note it’s a bad idea to directly analogize results from image analysis to language analysis.  The problems have radically different levels of conceptual abstraction baked-in.  Consider the problem of detecting the concept of a cat; i.e.</p><p>3 0.055744518 <a title="103-tfidf-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-09-10-Don%E2%80%99t_MAWK_AWK_%E2%80%93_the_fastest_and_most_elegant_big_data_munging_language%21.html">154 brendan oconnor ai-2009-09-10-Don’t MAWK AWK – the fastest and most elegant big data munging language!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: update 2012-10-25 : I’ve been informed there is a new maintainer for Mawk, who has probably fixed the bugs I’ve been seeing.
  

From: Gert Hulselmans   


[The bugs you have found are] indeed true with mawk v1.3.3 which comes standard with Debian/Ubuntu.  This version is almost not developed the last 10 years.


I now already use mawk v1.3.4 maintained by another developer (Thomas E. Dickey) 
for more than a year on huge datafiles (sometimes several GB).


The problems/wrong results I had with mawk v1.3.3 sometimes are gone. In his version, normally all open/known bugs are fixed.


This version can be downloaded from:  http://invisible-island.net/mawk/ 

     update 2010-04-30  : I have since found large datasets where mawk is buggy and gives the wrong result.  nawk seems safe.   When one of these newfangled   “Big Data”   sets comes your way, the very first thing you have to do is data munging: shuffling around file formats, renaming fields and the like.

<p>Introduction: Earlier this week I asked the question,
 
 How are “art” and “pharmaceuticals” similar? 
 
People sent me lots of submissions!  Some are great, some are a bit of a stretch.
  
 Overpriced by an order of magnitude.
  The letters of “art” are found embedded, in order, in “pharmaceuticals”.
  Search keywords that cost the most to advertise on?
  “Wyeth”: I think this means  this , and  this .
  “Romeo and Juliet” famously includes both “art” (wherefore art thou) and pharmaceuticals (poison!)
  Some art has been created out of pharmaceuticals.
  Some art has been created under the influence of pharmaceuticals.
   
I was asking because I was playing around with a dataset of 100,000 noun phrases’ appearances on the web, from the  Reading the Web  project at CMU.  That is, for a noun like “art”, this data has a large list of phrases in which the word “art” is used, across some 200 million web pages.  For two noun concepts, we can see what they have in common and what’s different by looking at</p><p>5 0.033815861 <a title="103-tfidf-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-02-23-Comparison_of_data_analysis_packages%3A_R%2C_Matlab%2C_SciPy%2C_Excel%2C_SAS%2C_SPSS%2C_Stata.html">135 brendan oconnor ai-2009-02-23-Comparison of data analysis packages: R, Matlab, SciPy, Excel, SAS, SPSS, Stata</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lukas  and I were trying to write a succinct comparison of the most popular packages that are typically used for data analysis.  I think most people choose one based on what people around them use or what they learn in school, so I’ve found it hard to find comparative information.  I’m posting the table here in hopes of useful comments.

<p>Introduction: This has to be the most quick-and-dirty data visualizer out there: I wrote an ascii art plotter script that takes a column of numbers on stdin and throws out a plot on your console.  I’ve been using it for several months to quickly look at numbers on the commandline, especially from logs and such.  (Back in school I would use gnuplot for this; R is good too.

<p>Introduction: I’m doing  word and bigram counts  on a corpus of tweets.  I want to store and rapidly retrieve them later for  language model  purposes.  So there’s a big table of counts that get incremented many times.  The easiest way to get something running is to use an open-source key/value store; but which?  There’s recently been some development in this area so I thought it would be good to revisit and evaluate some options.
 
Here are timings for a single counting process: iterate over 45,000 short text messages, tokenize them, then increment counters for their unigrams and bigrams.  (The speed of the data store is only one component of performance.)  There are about 17 increments per tweet: 400k unique terms and 750k total count.  This is substantially smaller than what I need, but it’s small enough to easily test.  I used several very different architectures and packages, explained below.

<p>Introduction: It’s fairly obvious that an average can be calculated online, but interestingly, there’s also a way to calculate a running variance and standard deviation.  Read all about it  here .
 
I’m playing around with the  Netflix Prize  data of 100 million movie ratings, and a huge problem is figuring out how to load and calculate everything in memory.  I’m having success with  NumPy , the numeric library for Python, because it compactly stores arrays with C/Fortran binary layouts.  For example, 100 million 32-bit floats = 100M * 4 = 400MB of memory, which is manageable.  And it’s much easier to play around interactively in  ipython / matplotlib  rather than write C++ for everything.
 
Unfortunately, the simple ways to calculate variance on an array of that size create wasteful intermediate data structures as long as the original array.
  
>>> mean( (x-mean(x)) ** 2 )            # two intermediate structures
>>> tmp=x-mean(x); tmp**=2; mean(tmp)   # one intermediate structure
  
That’s an e</p><p>5 0.4874616 <a title="103-lsi-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-09-26-Seeing_how_%E2%80%9Cart%E2%80%9D_and_%E2%80%9Cpharmaceuticals%E2%80%9D_are_linguistically_similar_in_web_text.html">156 brendan oconnor ai-2009-09-26-Seeing how “art” and “pharmaceuticals” are linguistically similar in web text</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Earlier this week I asked the question,
 
 How are “art” and “pharmaceuticals” similar? 
 
People sent me lots of submissions!  Some are great, some are a bit of a stretch.
  
 Overpriced by an order of magnitude.
  The letters of “art” are found embedded, in order, in “pharmaceuticals”.
  Search keywords that cost the most to advertise on?
  “Wyeth”: I think this means  this , and  this .
  “Romeo and Juliet” famously includes both “art” (wherefore art thou) and pharmaceuticals (poison!)
  Some art has been created out of pharmaceuticals.
  Some art has been created under the influence of pharmaceuticals.
   
I was asking because I was playing around with a dataset of 100,000 noun phrases’ appearances on the web, from the  Reading the Web  project at CMU.  That is, for a noun like “art”, this data has a large list of phrases in which the word “art” is used, across some 200 million web pages.  For two noun concepts, we can see what they have in common and what’s different by looking at</p><p>6 0.4690249 <a title="103-lsi-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-09-10-Don%E2%80%99t_MAWK_AWK_%E2%80%93_the_fastest_and_most_elegant_big_data_munging_language%21.html">154 brendan oconnor ai-2009-09-10-Don’t MAWK AWK – the fastest and most elegant big data munging language!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: [I]t is not the wish, or the interest of the Government, or any other upon this Continent, separately, or collectively, to set up for Independence…  I am well satisfyed, as I can be of my existence, that no such thing is desired by any thinking man in all North America; on the contrary, that it is the ardent wish of the warmest advocates for liberty, that peace & tranquility, upon Constitutional grounds, may be restored, & the horrors of civil discord prevented.

<p>Introduction: This has to be the most quick-and-dirty data visualizer out there: I wrote an ascii art plotter script that takes a column of numbers on stdin and throws out a plot on your console.  I’ve been using it for several months to quickly look at numbers on the commandline, especially from logs and such.  (Back in school I would use gnuplot for this; R is good too.  But sometimes you want to move really fast, esp if you have a few hideous perl -pe one-liners on your hands and mucking around with temp files will interrupt your flow.)

<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: OK, everyone loves to run dictionary methods for sentiment and other text analysis — counting words from a predefined lexicon in a big corpus, in order to explore or test hypotheses about the corpus.  In particular, this is often done for sentiment analysis: count positive and negative words (according to a sentiment polarity lexicon, which was derived from human raters or previous researchers’ intuitions), and then proclaim the output yields sentiment levels of the documents.  More and more papers come out every day that do this.   I’ve done this myself.   It’s interesting and fun, but it’s easy to get a bunch of meaningless numbers if you don’t carefully validate what’s going on.  There are certainly good studies in this area that do further validation and analysis, but it’s hard to trust a study that just presents a graph with a few overly strong speculative claims as to its meaning.  This happens more than it ought to.

<p>Introduction: Everyone recently seems to be talking about  this newish paper by Digrazia, McKelvey, Bollen, and Rojas  ( pdf here ) that examines the correlation of Congressional candidate name mentions on Twitter against whether the candidate won the race.  One of the coauthors also wrote a Washington Post  Op-Ed  about it.  I read the paper and I think it’s reasonable, but their op-ed overstates their results.  It claims:
  
“In the 2010 data, our Twitter data predicted the winner in 404 out of 435 competitive races”
  
But this analysis is nowhere in their paper.  Fabio Rojas has now  posted errata/rebuttals  about the op-ed and described this analysis they did here.  There are several major issues off the bat:
  
 They didn’t ever predict 404/435 races; they only analyzed 406 races they call “competitive,” getting 92.5% (in-sample) accuracy, then extrapolated to all races to get the 435 number. 
 They’re reporting about  in-sample  predictions, which is really misleading to a non-scientific audi</p><p>6 0.17075115 <a title="103-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-12-27-Facebook_sentiment_mining_predicts_presidential_polls.html">131 brendan oconnor ai-2008-12-27-Facebook sentiment mining predicts presidential polls</a></p>

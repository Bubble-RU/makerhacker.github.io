<p>Introduction: Great Microsoft Research report (from a workshop they held?):   2020 Science  where they argue that computer  science  will become part and parcel of science in general.  For example, computation theory will be important to understand biological organisms as information processing systems.

<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: Larry Wasserman has a new position paper (forthcoming 2013) with a great comparison the Statistics and Machine Learning research cultures,  “Rise of the Machines” .  He has a very conciliatory view in terms of intellectual content, and a very pro-ML take on the research cultures.  Central to his argument is that ML has recently adopted rigorous statistical concepts, and the fast-moving conference culture (and heavy publishing by its grad students) have helped with this and other good innovations.  (I agree with a comment from Sinead that he’s going a little easy on ML, but it’s certainly worth a read.)
 
There’s now a little history of “Statistics vs Machine Learning” position papers that this can be compared to.  A classic is Leo Breiman (2001),  “Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures” , which isn’t exactly about stats vs. ML, but is about the focus on modeling vs algorithms, and maybe about description vs. prediction.

<p>Introduction: This is fun —  Jamie Callan ‘s group at  CMU LTI  just finished a crawl of 1 billion web pages.  It’s 5 terabytes compressed — big enough so they have to send it to you by mailing hard drives.

One of their motivations was to have a corpus large enough such that research results on it would be taken seriously by search engine companies.  To my mind, this begs the question whether academics should try to innovate in web search, when it’s a research area incredibly dependent on really large, expensive-to-acquire datasets.  And what’s the point?  To slightly improve Google someday?  Don’t they do that pretty well themselves?
 
On the other hand, having a billion web pages around sounds like a lot of fun.  Someone should get Amazon to add this to the  AWS Public Datasets .  Then, to process the data, instead of paying to get 5 TB of data shipped to you, you instead pay Amazon to rent virtual computers that can access the data.  This costs less only to a certain point,</p><p>6 0.075957119 <a title="104-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2013/brendan_oconnor_ai-2013-09-13-Response_on_our_movie_personas_paper.html">200 brendan oconnor ai-2013-09-13-Response on our movie personas paper</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I laugh out loud every time I reread  Cosma Shalizi’s review of “New Kind of Science”  (2005).  I remember reading it back in college when everyone was talking about the book, when I was just losing my naivete about the popular science treatments of complex systems and such.  I must be getting more cynical as I get older because I keep liking the review more.  This time my favorite line was
  
Wolfram even goes on to refute post-modernism on this basis; I won’t touch that except to say that I’d have paid a lot to see Wolfram and Jacques Derrida go one-on-one.

<p>Introduction: WP:  Computers simulate terrorist extremes 
 
Los Alamos scientists are running terrorist attack/response simulations. Well, the article title is misleading, they’re not simulating terrorists (which would pose a whole set of interesting questions about scientific knowledge, social construction and security), but rather, the impact on telecomm, health, and infrastructure systems.  They’re using the standard justifications for systems simulation: these are big, highly complex, highly interdependent systems that are ill-understood and have had drastic domino-effect collapses before (like the northeast power blackout).
 
The article also talks about epidemiology simulations (smallpox in this case, following the terrorist scenario again) that take into account the interactions of individual people with each other — very much along the lines of agent-based simulations, and satisfying complexity theory’s arguments about tipping points and emergent effects.

<p>Introduction: Don’t have time to read much right now, but received word about a neat-looking paper:  Uncomputability: The Problem of Induction Internalized  by Kevin Kelly.
 
Kevin Kelly’s website has an awesome statement that mirrors thoughts I’ve been having for the last few years — the incredible importance of computational constraints applied to reasoning and rationality:
  
Kuhn teaches that a single, deep success suffices to keep a competing paradign on the table.  Not surprisingly, computational learning theory shows its superiority over ideal theories of rationality when we trade in our ideal agents for more realistic, computable agents.  The foundation of the deep success is a strong structural analogy between the halting problem and the problem of inductive generalization, allowing for a unified treatment of both, from the ground up.  One consequence of the approach is that one can often show that computable agents are forced to choose between ideal rationality and finding the right answer</p><p>same-blog 2 0.9606666 <a title="104-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-05-23-Sub-reddit_for_Systems_Science_and_OR.html">104 brendan oconnor ai-2008-05-23-Sub-reddit for Systems Science and OR</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve been a big fan of Reddit’s  Programing  subsite for a while.  Just this morning I found another sub-reddit:  SYSOR: Systems Science, Operations Research and Everything In Between , and I’m loving it.  Lots of links on data mining, graph software, image recognition, learning theory, etc etc.
 
Not sure if the Operations Research part in the title is so big now — there’s some sort of complicated reorganization of a number of fields including operations research, systems science, computational learning, and more general computer science areas.  I’m a fan of the great historical overview in the Introduction in  Rusell and Norvig’s AI book ; I’m sure it’s slanted in various ways, but what else are overarching narratives for?  :)</p><p>3 0.94788748 <a title="104-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-04-08-Gapminder.org_%E2%80%94_terrific_world_data_visualizations.html">57 brendan oconnor ai-2007-04-08-Gapminder.org — terrific world data visualizations</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I must be too cynical.  I thought I didn’t like  Philip Zimbardo ‘s theatrics, but regardless I really appreciated  this NYT interview  with him on the universal capacity for evil.     (S.P.E. is the  Stanford Prison Experiment , whose pictures here are from that lovely basement hallway, still there behind the 420-40 and 41 lecture rooms.)
 
In particular: 
 Q. What was your reaction when you first saw those photographs from Abu Ghraib? 
 
A. I was shocked. But not surprised. I immediately flashed on similar pictures from the S.P.E. What particularly bothered me was that the Pentagon blamed the whole thing on a “few bad apples.” I knew from our experiment, if you put good apples into a bad situation, you’ll get bad apples.
 
That was why I was willing to be an expert witness for Sgt. Chip Frederick, who was ultimately sentenced to eight years for his role at Abu Ghraib. Frederick was the Army reservist who was put in charge of the night shift at Tier 1A, where detainees were abused.

<p>Introduction: I was planning to write some  WordNet  lookup code tonight.  But instead I’ve learned of too many intersecting things.
 
First, there are a zillion things to do this weekend ( hooray flavorpill ):
 
  Picasso and American Art  exhibit continuing at  SFMOMA .  I saw it very briefly last weekend but want some more.  And Doug claims there’s an interesting photography exhibit there too.
  Reading from  We Don’t Need Another Wave: Dispatches from the Next Generation of Feminists , a fascinating looking book I’ve seen many times in the bookstores around here.  By that I mean at least Modern Times (the neat Mission bookstore) and the Anarchist Collective Bookstore (out on the Haight).  And the reading is at Modern Times,  just down the street  from my house!  Amazing.  Tomorrow at 7:30.
  Since anarchists were just mentioned, fortuitously there also appears: the  Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair  this Saturday and Sunday!  Speakers and books down by Golden Gate Park, oh my.

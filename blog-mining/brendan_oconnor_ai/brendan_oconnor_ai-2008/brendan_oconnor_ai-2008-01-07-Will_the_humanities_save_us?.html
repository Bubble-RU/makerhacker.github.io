<p>Introduction: Great anti-pop-science article of the moment —  Mark Liberman does a take-down  of David Brooks’ apparently  careless column  on cultural psych experiments that purport to show that East Asians are collectivist while Westerns are individualist.
 
From Liberman: 
  Question to Language Log:  Is it correct that if you show an American an image of a fish tank, the American will usually describe the biggest fish in the tank and what it is doing, while if you ask a Chinese person to describe a fish tank, the Chinese will usually describe the context in which the fish swim? 
 
 Answer:  In principle, yes. But first of all, it wasn’t a representative sample of Americans, it was undergraduates in a psychology course at the University of Michigan; and second, it wasn’t Chinese, it was undergraduates in a psychology course at Kyoto University in Japan; and third, it wasn’t a fish tank, it was 10 20-second animated vignettes of underwater scenes; and fourth, the Americans didn’t mention the “foca</p><p>3 0.12178844 <a title="89-tfidf-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-06-17-%22Time_will_tell%2C_epistemology_won%E2%80%99t%22.html">65 brendan oconnor ai-2007-06-17-"Time will tell, epistemology won’t"</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Working on applied AI-related problems has really tempered my outlook away from theory.  Apologies for another Rorty-related post, but I loved this little bit I just came across, from  Stanley Fish (on slate.com) : 
 When Rorty concluded one of his dramatically undramatic performances, the hands shot up like quivering spears, and the questions were hurled in outraged tones that were almost comically in contrast to the low-key withdrawn words that had provoked them. 
 
Why outrage? Because more often than not a Rortyan sentence would, with irritatingly little fuss, take away everything his hearers believed in. Take, for example, this little Rortyan gem: “Time will tell; but epistemology won’t.” That is to sayâ€”and the fact that I have recourse to the ponderously academic circumlocution “that is to say” tells its own (for me) sad storyâ€”if you’re putting your faith in some grandly ambitious account of the way we know things and hoping that if you get the account right, you will be that</p><p>4 0.071620494 <a title="89-tfidf-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-10-08-MyDebates.org%2C_online_polling%2C_and_potentially_the_coolest_question_corpus_ever.html">116 brendan oconnor ai-2008-10-08-MyDebates.org, online polling, and potentially the coolest question corpus ever</a></p>
<p>Introduction: MySpace and the  Commission on the Presidential Debates  put together a neat site,  mydebates.org , which presents the candidates’ positions through various mini-polls and such.  It even has a cool data exploration tool for the poll results … for example, here are two support maps, one for respondents over 65 and one for 18-24 year olds.
 
   
 
    Anyway, the site also takes submissions of questions for tonight’s debate.  Apparently  six million  questions were submitted, and moderator Tom Brokaw will of course use only 10 or so.  This begs a question, how were they selected?  There’s no Digg-like social filtering or anything.  You could imagine automatic methods to help narrow down the pool: Topic clustering?  Quality ranking on syntax and vocabulary?
 
 Eric Fish  suggested the obvious: probably someone picked 1000 randomly and sent them to Brokaw.

<p>Introduction: Herbert Gintis thinks  it’s time to unify the behavioral sciences. Sociology, economics, political science, human biology, anthropology and others all study the same thing, but each is based on different incompatible models of individual human behavior. There seems to be evidence that new developments have the potential to offer a more unifying theory. Evolutionary biology should be the basis of understanding much of human behavior. Rational choice and game theoretic frameworks are finding greater acceptance beyond economics; in the meantime, other fields need to absorb sociology’s emphasis on socialization — that people do things or understand the world in a way taught by society. The human behavioral sciences are still rife with many smaller inconsistencies; for example, according to Gintis, only anthropolgists look at the influence of culture across groups, but only sociologists look at culture within groups.
 
Gintis’ ultimate goal is to have a common baseline from which each disci</p><p>6 0.03552448 <a title="89-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2011/brendan_oconnor_ai-2011-05-21-iPhone_autocorrection_error_analysis.html">170 brendan oconnor ai-2011-05-21-iPhone autocorrection error analysis</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Absolutely amazing — a  short film  chronicling conflicts from World War II — as food.
 
  
 
I think this has to have the highest amount of Wikipedia-linkable references per second of any film I’ve seen.  Yes, it’s U.S.-centric, but so is Wikipedia, which makes cataloguing it easier.  At the very least:
 
  World War II 
 
  Persecution of Jews  and  The Holocaust  
  Invasion of France  
  The Blitz  
  Pearl Harbor ,  Pacific Theater  
  D-Day  
  Liberation of France  Invasion of Germany –  Western  and  Eastern  fronts 
  Atomic bombing of Hiroshima

<p>Introduction: Working on applied AI-related problems has really tempered my outlook away from theory.  Apologies for another Rorty-related post, but I loved this little bit I just came across, from  Stanley Fish (on slate.com) : 
 When Rorty concluded one of his dramatically undramatic performances, the hands shot up like quivering spears, and the questions were hurled in outraged tones that were almost comically in contrast to the low-key withdrawn words that had provoked them. 
 
Why outrage? Because more often than not a Rortyan sentence would, with irritatingly little fuss, take away everything his hearers believed in. Take, for example, this little Rortyan gem: “Time will tell; but epistemology won’t.” That is to sayâ€”and the fact that I have recourse to the ponderously academic circumlocution “that is to say” tells its own (for me) sad storyâ€”if you’re putting your faith in some grandly ambitious account of the way we know things and hoping that if you get the account right, you will be that</p><p>4 0.025946444 <a title="89-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2006/brendan_oconnor_ai-2006-06-03-Neuroeconomics_reviews.html">38 brendan oconnor ai-2006-06-03-Neuroeconomics reviews</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here are two great reviews, from 2003 then 2005.
 
1)  PLoS Biology: Economy of the Mind  nicely reviews the field and many interesting experiments.
 
One annoyance: They need to say “Banburismus” is more commonly known as Bayesian learning.  (Banbury, England was a city near Bletchley Park they got their paper from when doing Bayesian statistical codebreaking of the Enigma cipher in World War II.   Read the story here  in MacKay’s excellent free online  textbook .)   Thanks to  neurodudes  for the PLoS link.
 
2)  Neuroeconomics: How neuroscience can inform economics  is written by the leaders of the field, advocating their approach.  I like the detail and their careful descriptions of how cognitive neuroscience findings can enhance our understanding of economic phenomena.
 
Also, the second is useful to read since it’s the target of criticism by the more recent  The case for mindless economics , which I view as an empire-strikes-back sort of paper.  I’m waiting for Part III of this s</p><p>5 0.025459759 <a title="89-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-09-18-%22Machine%22_translation-vision_%28Stanford_AI_courses_online%29.html">113 brendan oconnor ai-2008-09-18-"Machine" translation-vision (Stanford AI courses online)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Stanford Engineering school has put up videos and course materials for several programming, AI, and optimization courses online.  They did get some of the ones that are taught by excellent lecturers — e.g. introductory programming (the CS dept has craploads of money, so can afford to hire specialist lecturers, which results in very good courses), and Brad Osgood on the FFT (he’s just such a good lecturer).
 
 Main link ,  minor link. 
 
I was looking through the transcript of  Chris Manning’s introductory lecture  for CS224N, Natural Language Processing, last year.  ( SEE link ;  actual website link .)  I took this same course years ago as a sophomore, and this part sounded familiar:
  
So if you look at the early history of NLP, NLP essentially started in the 1950s. It started just after World War II in the beginning of the Cold War. And what NLP started off as is the field of  machine translation , of can you use computers to translate automatically from one language to another l</p><p>6 0.023847869 <a title="89-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2006/brendan_oconnor_ai-2006-04-24-The_identity_politics_of_satananic_zombie_alien_man-beasts.html">33 brendan oconnor ai-2006-04-24-The identity politics of satananic zombie alien man-beasts</a></p>

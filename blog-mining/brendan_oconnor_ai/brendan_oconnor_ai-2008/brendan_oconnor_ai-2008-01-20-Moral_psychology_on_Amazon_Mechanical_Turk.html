<p>Introduction: Not much on this blog lately, so I’ll repost a comment I just wrote on whether to use pairwise vs. absolute judgments for relevance quality evaluation.  (A fun one I know!)
 
From  this post on the Dolores Labs blog .
 
The paper being talked about is  Here or There: Preference Judgments for Relevance  by Carterette et al.
  
I skimmed through the Carterette paper and it’s interesting. My concern with pairwise setup is, in order to get comparability among query-result pairs, you need to get annotators to do an O(N^2) amount of work. (Unless you do something horribly complicated with partial orders.) The absolute judgment task scales linearly, of course. Given the AMT environment and a fixed budget, if I stay in the smaller-volume task, instead of spending a lot on a quadratic taskload, I can simply get a higher number of workers per result and boil out more noise. Of course, if it’s true the pairwise judgment task is easier — as the paper claims — that might make my spending more effic</p><p>3 0.090401903 <a title="90-tfidf-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-10-08-MyDebates.org%2C_online_polling%2C_and_potentially_the_coolest_question_corpus_ever.html">116 brendan oconnor ai-2008-10-08-MyDebates.org, online polling, and potentially the coolest question corpus ever</a></p>
<p>Introduction: MySpace and the  Commission on the Presidential Debates  put together a neat site,  mydebates.org , which presents the candidates’ positions through various mini-polls and such.  It even has a cool data exploration tool for the poll results … for example, here are two support maps, one for respondents over 65 and one for 18-24 year olds.
 
   
 
    Anyway, the site also takes submissions of questions for tonight’s debate.  Apparently  six million  questions were submitted, and moderator Tom Brokaw will of course use only 10 or so.  This begs a question, how were they selected?  There’s no Digg-like social filtering or anything.  You could imagine automatic methods to help narrow down the pool: Topic clustering?  Quality ranking on syntax and vocabulary?
 
 Eric Fish  suggested the obvious: probably someone picked 1000 randomly and sent them to Brokaw.

Famously,  he made a plea to his superiors and was denied .  (The genocide ended only when a rebel army managed a string of military victories and forcibly stopped the killing.)

<p>Introduction: I must be too cynical.  I thought I didn’t like  Philip Zimbardo ‘s theatrics, but regardless I really appreciated  this NYT interview  with him on the universal capacity for evil.     (S.P.E. is the  Stanford Prison Experiment , whose pictures here are from that lovely basement hallway, still there behind the 420-40 and 41 lecture rooms.)
 
In particular: 
 Q. What was your reaction when you first saw those photographs from Abu Ghraib? 
 
A. I was shocked. But not surprised. I immediately flashed on similar pictures from the S.P.E. What particularly bothered me was that the Pentagon blamed the whole thing on a “few bad apples.” I knew from our experiment, if you put good apples into a bad situation, you’ll get bad apples.
 
That was why I was willing to be an expert witness for Sgt. Chip Frederick, who was ultimately sentenced to eight years for his role at Abu Ghraib. Frederick was the Army reservist who was put in charge of the night shift at Tier 1A, where detainees were abused.

<p>Introduction: I started reading Jeffrey Sachs’ new book  The End of Poverty .  The first 30 pages are excellent, but it starts getting arrogant and annoying quick.  Substantively, I’m uncertain whether a big new development aid push will solve things.
 
Since I enthusiastically bum around course websites I’m not taking (bad habit, will stop real soon now), I was fortunate to run across an excellent debate between Sachs and William Easterly:
 
 Easterly’s view on Africa: The West Can’t Take The Lead  which has some amazing anecdotes about African educators and entrepreneurs.  (Or, I think they’re amazing only because I’m a condescending Westerner?)
 
 Easterly reviews Sachs .  Choice quote: 
 “Success in ending the poverty trap,” Sachs writes, “will be much easier than it appears.” Really? If it’s so easy, why haven’t five decades of effort gotten the job done? Sachs should redirect some of his outrage at the question of why the previous $2.3 trillion didn’t reach the poor so that the next $2.3 trill</p><p>5 0.54465371 <a title="90-lsi-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-12-20-Data-driven_charity.html">86 brendan oconnor ai-2007-12-20-Data-driven charity</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Some ex-hedge fund analysts recently started a non-profit devoted to evaluating the effectiveness of hundreds of charities, and  apparently have been making waves (NYT) .  A few interesting reports have been posted on their website,  givewell.net  — they make recommendations for which charities where donors’ money is used most efficiently for saving lives or helping the disadvantaged.
 
(Does anyone else have interesting data on charity effectiveness?  I’ve heard that evaluations are the big thing in philanthropy world now, and certainly the Gates Foundation talks a lot about it.)
 
Obviously this sort of evaluation is tricky, but it  has  to be the right approach.  The NYT article makes them sound like they’re a bit arrogant, which is too bad; on the other hand, any one who makes claims to have better empirical information than the established wisdom will always end up in that dynamic.

<p>Introduction: Is social science even worth doing when things like  this  get funded with hundreds of millions of federal dollars? 
 Many American youngsters participating in federally funded abstinence-only programs have been taught over the past three years that abortion can lead to sterility and suicide, that half the gay male teenagers in the United States have tested positive for the AIDS virus, and that touching a person’s genitals “can result in pregnancy,” a congressional staff analysis has found. 
 
…

  Among the misconceptions cited by Waxman’s investigators:
  • A 43-day-old fetus is a “thinking person.” • HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, can be spread via sweat and tears. • Condoms fail to prevent HIV transmission as often as 31 percent of the time in heterosexual intercourse.
 
…
 
When used properly and consistently, condoms fail to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) less than 3 percent of the time, federal researchers say, and it is not known how many gay teena</p><p>2 0.96792841 <a title="90-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-08-15-East_vs_West_cultural_psychology%21.html">110 brendan oconnor ai-2008-08-15-East vs West cultural psychology!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Great anti-pop-science article of the moment —  Mark Liberman does a take-down  of David Brooks’ apparently  careless column  on cultural psych experiments that purport to show that East Asians are collectivist while Westerns are individualist.
 
From Liberman: 
  Question to Language Log:  Is it correct that if you show an American an image of a fish tank, the American will usually describe the biggest fish in the tank and what it is doing, while if you ask a Chinese person to describe a fish tank, the Chinese will usually describe the context in which the fish swim? 
 
 Answer:  In principle, yes. But first of all, it wasn’t a representative sample of Americans, it was undergraduates in a psychology course at the University of Michigan; and second, it wasn’t Chinese, it was undergraduates in a psychology course at Kyoto University in Japan; and third, it wasn’t a fish tank, it was 10 20-second animated vignettes of underwater scenes; and fourth, the Americans didn’t mention the “foca</p><p>same-blog 3 0.90113866 <a title="90-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-01-20-Moral_psychology_on_Amazon_Mechanical_Turk.html">90 brendan oconnor ai-2008-01-20-Moral psychology on Amazon Mechanical Turk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There’s a lot of exciting work in moral psychology right now.  I’ve been telling various poor fools who listen to me to read something from  Jonathan Haidt  or  Joshua Greene , but of course there’s a sea of too many articles and books of varying quality and intended audience.  But just last week Steven Pinker wrote a great NYT magazine article,  “The Moral Instinct,”  which summarizes current research and tries to spell out a few implications.  I recommend it highly, if just for presenting so many awesome examples.  (Yes, this blog has  poked fun  at Pinker before.  But in any case, he is a brilliant expository writer.   The Language Instinct  is still one of my favorite popular science books.)
 
For a while now I’ve been thinking that recruiting subjects online could lend itself to collecting some really interesting behavioral science data.  A few months ago I tried doing this with  Amazon Mechanical Turk , a horribly misnamed web service that actually lets you create web-based tasks</p><p>4 0.3921473 <a title="90-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2014/brendan_oconnor_ai-2014-02-19-What_the_ACL-2014_review_scores_mean.html">203 brendan oconnor ai-2014-02-19-What the ACL-2014 review scores mean</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve had several people ask me what the numbers in  ACL  reviews mean — and I can’t find anywhere online where they’re described.  (Can anyone point this out if it is somewhere?)
 
So here’s the review form, below.  They all go from 1 to 5, with 5 the best.  I think the review emails to authors only include a subset of the below — for example, “Overall Recommendation” is not included?
 
The CFP said that they have different types of review forms for different types of papers.  I think this one is for a standard full paper.  I guess what people  really  want to know is what scores tend to correspond to acceptances.  I really have no idea and I get the impression this can change year to year.  I have no involvement with the ACL conference besides being one of many, many reviewers.
 
  
  
APPROPRIATENESS (1-5)
Does the paper fit in ACL 2014? (Please answer this question in light of the desire to broaden the scope of the research areas represented at ACL.) 

5: Certainly.

<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

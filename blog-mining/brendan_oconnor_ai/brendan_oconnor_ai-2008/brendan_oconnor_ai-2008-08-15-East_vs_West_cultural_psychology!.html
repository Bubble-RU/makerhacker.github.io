<p>Introduction: It’s been a good year.  Last fall I started a master’s program in the Language Technologies department at  CMU SCS , taking some great classes, hanging out with a  cool lab , and writing two new papers (for  ICWSM , involving Twitter:  polls  and  tweetmotif ; also did some  coref  work, financial text regression stuff, and looked at  social lexicography .)  I also applied to CS and stats PhD programs at several universities.  Next year I’ll be starting the PhD program in the  Machine Learning Department  here at CMU.
 
I’m excited!  Just the other day I was looking at videos on my old hard drive and found a presentation by  Tom Mitchell  on “the Discipline of Machine Learning” that I downloaded back in 2007 or so.  (Can’t find it online right now, but  this is similar .)  That might be where I heard of the department first.  Maybe some day I will be smarter than the guy who wrote  this rant  (though I am much more pro-stats and anti-ML these days…).

<p>Introduction: This is off-topic for this blog but here goes.   ConnectU , a small college social networking site, has been in the news due to their  apparently weak lawsuit against Facebook , in which they claim  Mark Zuckerberg  stole their business plan and computer code back when they all were Harvard undergraduates.  (Judges involved have noted the case’s flimsy evidence; some technology commentators — as well as everyone I know — have noted that the business idea wasn’t all that brilliant or original in the first place.)  Zuckerberg, of course, went on to found Facebook and bring it to incredible success.
 
I tried to use the ConnectU site recently, but got an error when searching for a funny name with an apostrophe,  o’connor .  It turns out this was symptomatic of a very grave security flaw in their code, an  SQL injection vulnerability .  While Facebook recently had  a minor security-related glitch , ConnectU’s flaw is far more serious.  A malicious attacker could use this to easily break in</p><p>6 0.071067527 <a title="110-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-10-08-MyDebates.org%2C_online_polling%2C_and_potentially_the_coolest_question_corpus_ever.html">116 brendan oconnor ai-2008-10-08-MyDebates.org, online polling, and potentially the coolest question corpus ever</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Great anti-pop-science article of the moment —  Mark Liberman does a take-down  of David Brooks’ apparently  careless column  on cultural psych experiments that purport to show that East Asians are collectivist while Westerns are individualist.

<p>Introduction: Working on applied AI-related problems has really tempered my outlook away from theory.  Apologies for another Rorty-related post, but I loved this little bit I just came across, from  Stanley Fish (on slate.com) : 
 When Rorty concluded one of his dramatically undramatic performances, the hands shot up like quivering spears, and the questions were hurled in outraged tones that were almost comically in contrast to the low-key withdrawn words that had provoked them. 
 
Why outrage? Because more often than not a Rortyan sentence would, with irritatingly little fuss, take away everything his hearers believed in. Take, for example, this little Rortyan gem: “Time will tell; but epistemology won’t.” That is to sayâ€”and the fact that I have recourse to the ponderously academic circumlocution “that is to say” tells its own (for me) sad storyâ€”if you’re putting your faith in some grandly ambitious account of the way we know things and hoping that if you get the account right, you will be that</p><p>5 0.31245571 <a title="110-lsi-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-10-08-MyDebates.org%2C_online_polling%2C_and_potentially_the_coolest_question_corpus_ever.html">116 brendan oconnor ai-2008-10-08-MyDebates.org, online polling, and potentially the coolest question corpus ever</a></p>
<p>Introduction: MySpace and the  Commission on the Presidential Debates  put together a neat site,  mydebates.org , which presents the candidates’ positions through various mini-polls and such.  It even has a cool data exploration tool for the poll results … for example, here are two support maps, one for respondents over 65 and one for 18-24 year olds.
 
   
 
    Anyway, the site also takes submissions of questions for tonight’s debate.  Apparently  six million  questions were submitted, and moderator Tom Brokaw will of course use only 10 or so.  This begs a question, how were they selected?  There’s no Digg-like social filtering or anything.  You could imagine automatic methods to help narrow down the pool: Topic clustering?  Quality ranking on syntax and vocabulary?
 
 Eric Fish  suggested the obvious: probably someone picked 1000 randomly and sent them to Brokaw.
 
I’d love to see a corpus of 6 million questions on U.S. political subjects, directed at only two different people.

<p>Introduction: Is social science even worth doing when things like  this  get funded with hundreds of millions of federal dollars? 
 Many American youngsters participating in federally funded abstinence-only programs have been taught over the past three years that abortion can lead to sterility and suicide, that half the gay male teenagers in the United States have tested positive for the AIDS virus, and that touching a person’s genitals “can result in pregnancy,” a congressional staff analysis has found. 
 
…

  Among the misconceptions cited by Waxman’s investigators:
  • A 43-day-old fetus is a “thinking person.” • HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, can be spread via sweat and tears. • Condoms fail to prevent HIV transmission as often as 31 percent of the time in heterosexual intercourse.
 
…
 
When used properly and consistently, condoms fail to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) less than 3 percent of the time, federal researchers say, and it is not known how many gay teena</p><p>same-blog 2 0.96303922 <a title="110-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-08-15-East_vs_West_cultural_psychology%21.html">110 brendan oconnor ai-2008-08-15-East vs West cultural psychology!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Great anti-pop-science article of the moment —  Mark Liberman does a take-down  of David Brooks’ apparently  careless column  on cultural psych experiments that purport to show that East Asians are collectivist while Westerns are individualist.
 
From Liberman: 
  Question to Language Log:  Is it correct that if you show an American an image of a fish tank, the American will usually describe the biggest fish in the tank and what it is doing, while if you ask a Chinese person to describe a fish tank, the Chinese will usually describe the context in which the fish swim? 
 
 Answer:  In principle, yes. But first of all, it wasn’t a representative sample of Americans, it was undergraduates in a psychology course at the University of Michigan; and second, it wasn’t Chinese, it was undergraduates in a psychology course at Kyoto University in Japan; and third, it wasn’t a fish tank, it was 10 20-second animated vignettes of underwater scenes; and fourth, the Americans didn’t mention the “foca</p><p>3 0.73596323 <a title="110-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-01-20-Moral_psychology_on_Amazon_Mechanical_Turk.html">90 brendan oconnor ai-2008-01-20-Moral psychology on Amazon Mechanical Turk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There’s a lot of exciting work in moral psychology right now.  I’ve been telling various poor fools who listen to me to read something from  Jonathan Haidt  or  Joshua Greene , but of course there’s a sea of too many articles and books of varying quality and intended audience.  But just last week Steven Pinker wrote a great NYT magazine article,  “The Moral Instinct,”  which summarizes current research and tries to spell out a few implications.  I recommend it highly, if just for presenting so many awesome examples.  (Yes, this blog has  poked fun  at Pinker before.  But in any case, he is a brilliant expository writer.   The Language Instinct  is still one of my favorite popular science books.)
 
For a while now I’ve been thinking that recruiting subjects online could lend itself to collecting some really interesting behavioral science data.  A few months ago I tried doing this with  Amazon Mechanical Turk , a horribly misnamed web service that actually lets you create web-based tasks</p><p>4 0.19177115 <a title="110-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2004/brendan_oconnor_ai-2004-11-24-addiction_%26_2_problems_of_economics.html">2 brendan oconnor ai-2004-11-24-addiction & 2 problems of economics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is my idea based off of  Bernheim and Rangel’s  model of addict decision-making .  It’s a really neat model; it manages to relax rationality to allow someone to do something they don’t want to do because they’re addicted to it.  [Rationality assumes a nice well-ordered set of preferences; this model hypothesizes as distinction between emotional "liking" and cognitive, forward "wanting" that can conflict.]  The model is mathematically tractable, it can be used for public welfare analysis, and to top it off — it’s got neuroscientific grounding!
 
It appears to me there are two big criticisms of the economics discipline’s assumptions.  One of course is rationality.  The second has to do with the perfect structure of the market and environment that shapes both preferences and the ability to exercise them.  One critique is about social structure: consumers are not atomistic individual units, but rather exchange information and ideas along networks of patterned social relations.

<p>Introduction: Everyone recently seems to be talking about  this newish paper by Digrazia, McKelvey, Bollen, and Rojas  ( pdf here ) that examines the correlation of Congressional candidate name mentions on Twitter against whether the candidate won the race.  One of the coauthors also wrote a Washington Post  Op-Ed  about it.  I read the paper and I think it’s reasonable, but their op-ed overstates their results.  It claims:
  
“In the 2010 data, our Twitter data predicted the winner in 404 out of 435 competitive races”
  
But this analysis is nowhere in their paper.  Fabio Rojas has now  posted errata/rebuttals  about the op-ed and described this analysis they did here.  There are several major issues off the bat:
  
 They didn’t ever predict 404/435 races; they only analyzed 406 races they call “competitive,” getting 92.5% (in-sample) accuracy, then extrapolated to all races to get the 435 number. 
 They’re reporting about  in-sample  predictions, which is really misleading to a non-scientific audi</p><p>6 0.16691421 <a title="110-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-12-27-Facebook_sentiment_mining_predicts_presidential_polls.html">131 brendan oconnor ai-2008-12-27-Facebook sentiment mining predicts presidential polls</a></p>

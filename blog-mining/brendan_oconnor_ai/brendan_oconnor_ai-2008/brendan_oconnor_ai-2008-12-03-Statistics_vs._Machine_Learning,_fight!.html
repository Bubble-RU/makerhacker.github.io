</p><p>5 There are certainly plenty of things in statistics that aren’t considered part of ML — say, regression diagnostics and significance testing. [sent-28, score-0.564]

</p><p>13 That is not to say statistics is not important — it’s incredibly important. [sent-72, score-0.412]
</p><p>14 Friedman continues (light editing and emphasis is mine):     One view says that our field should concentrate on that small part of information science that we do best, namely probabilistic inference based on mathematics. [sent-76, score-0.484]
</p><p>15 Another point of view holds that statistics ought to be concerned with  data analysis . [sent-78, score-0.602]

<p>Introduction: Larry Wasserman has a new position paper (forthcoming 2013) with a great comparison the Statistics and Machine Learning research cultures,  “Rise of the Machines” .  He has a very conciliatory view in terms of intellectual content, and a very pro-ML take on the research cultures.

There’s now a little history of “Statistics vs Machine Learning” position papers that this can be compared to.  A classic is Leo Breiman (2001),  “Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures” , which isn’t exactly about stats vs. ML, but is about the focus on modeling vs algorithms, and maybe about description vs. prediction.

<p>Introduction: I think I believe one of these things, but I’m not quite sure. 
 Statistics is just like logic, except with uncertainty. 
 
This would be true if statistics is Bayesian statistics and you buy the Bayesian inductive logic story — add induction to propositional logic, via a conditional credibility operator, and the Cox axioms imply standard probability theory as a consequence.  (That is, probability theory is logic with uncertainty.  And then a good Bayesian thinks probability theory and statistics are the same.)  Links:  Jaynes’ explanation ;  SEP article ; also  Fitelson’s article .  (Though there are negative results; all I can think of right now is a  Halpern  article on Cox; and also interesting is  Halpern and Koller .)
 
Secondly, here is another statement.
  

Statistics is just like logic, except with a big N.

  
This is a more data-driven view — the world is full of things and they need to be described.  Logical rules can help you describe things, but you also have to deal wit</p><p>4 0.15006675 <a title="129-tfidf-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-09-18-%22Machine%22_translation-vision_%28Stanford_AI_courses_online%29.html">113 brendan oconnor ai-2008-09-18-"Machine" translation-vision (Stanford AI courses online)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Stanford Engineering school has put up videos and course materials for several programming, AI, and optimization courses online.  They did get some of the ones that are taught by excellent lecturers — e.g. introductory programming (the CS dept has craploads of money, so can afford to hire specialist lecturers, which results in very good courses), and Brad Osgood on the FFT (he’s just such a good lecturer).
 
 Main link ,  minor link. 
 
I was looking through the transcript of  Chris Manning’s introductory lecture  for CS224N, Natural Language Processing, last year.  ( SEE link ;  actual website link .)  I took this same course years ago as a sophomore, and this part sounded familiar:
  
So if you look at the early history of NLP, NLP essentially started in the 1950s. It started just after World War II in the beginning of the Cold War. And what NLP started off as is the field of  machine translation , of can you use computers to translate automatically from one language to another l</p><p>5 0.1384857 <a title="129-tfidf-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2010/brendan_oconnor_ai-2010-08-09-An_ML-AI_approach_to_P_%21%3D_NP.html">161 brendan oconnor ai-2010-08-09-An ML-AI approach to P != NP</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Like everyone, I’ve been just starting to look at the new, tentative,  proof that P != NP  from Vinay Deolalikar.  After reading the intro, what’s most striking is that probabilistic graphical models and mathematical logic are at the core of the proof.  This feels like a machine learning and artificial intelligence-centric approach to me — very different from what you usually see in mainstream CS theory.  (Maybe I should feel good that in my undergrad I basically stopped studying normal math and spent all my time with this weird stuff instead!)
 
He devotes several chapters to an introduction to graphical models — Ising models, conditional independence, MRF’s, Hammersley-Clifford, and all that other stuff you see in  Koller and Friedman  or something — and then logic and model theory!  I’m impressed.</p><p>6 0.13149846 <a title="129-tfidf-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-02-23-Comparison_of_data_analysis_packages%3A_R%2C_Matlab%2C_SciPy%2C_Excel%2C_SAS%2C_SPSS%2C_Stata.html">135 brendan oconnor ai-2009-02-23-Comparison of data analysis packages: R, Matlab, SciPy, Excel, SAS, SPSS, Stata</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I keep learning new bits of linear algebra all the time, but I’m always hurting for a useful reference.  I probably should get a good book (which?), but in the meantime I’m collecting several nice online sources that ML researchers seem to often recommend: The Matrix Cookbook, plus a few more tutorial/introductory pieces, aimed at an intermediate-ish level.
 
Main reference:
  
  The Matrix Cookbook  – 71 pages of identities and such.  This seems to be really popular. 
  
Tutorials/introductions:
  
  CS229 linear algebra review  – from Stanford’s ML course.  It seems to introduce all the essentials, and it’s vaguely familiar for me.  (26 pages) 
 Minka’s  Old and New Matrix Algebra Useful for Statistics  – has a great part on how to do derivatives.  (19 pages)

<p>Introduction: Like everyone, I’ve been just starting to look at the new, tentative,  proof that P != NP  from Vinay Deolalikar.  After reading the intro, what’s most striking is that probabilistic graphical models and mathematical logic are at the core of the proof.  This feels like a machine learning and artificial intelligence-centric approach to me — very different from what you usually see in mainstream CS theory.  (Maybe I should feel good that in my undergrad I basically stopped studying normal math and spent all my time with this weird stuff instead!)
 
He devotes several chapters to an introduction to graphical models — Ising models, conditional independence, MRF’s, Hammersley-Clifford, and all that other stuff you see in  Koller and Friedman  or something — and then logic and model theory!  I’m impressed.</p><p>5 0.57908559 <a title="129-lsi-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-03-21-Statistics_is_big-N_logic%3F.html">54 brendan oconnor ai-2007-03-21-Statistics is big-N logic?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I think I believe one of these things, but I’m not quite sure. 
 Statistics is just like logic, except with uncertainty. 
 
This would be true if statistics is Bayesian statistics and you buy the Bayesian inductive logic story — add induction to propositional logic, via a conditional credibility operator, and the Cox axioms imply standard probability theory as a consequence.  (That is, probability theory is logic with uncertainty.  And then a good Bayesian thinks probability theory and statistics are the same.)  Links:  Jaynes’ explanation ;  SEP article ; also  Fitelson’s article .  (Though there are negative results; all I can think of right now is a  Halpern  article on Cox; and also interesting is  Halpern and Koller .)
 
Secondly, here is another statement.
  

Statistics is just like logic, except with a big N.

  
This is a more data-driven view — the world is full of things and they need to be described.  Logical rules can help you describe things, but you also have to deal wit</p><p>6 0.54465681 <a title="129-lsi-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-01-23-SF_conference_for_data_mining_mercenaries.html">133 brendan oconnor ai-2009-01-23-SF conference for data mining mercenaries</a></p>

<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: I was planning to write some  WordNet  lookup code tonight.  But instead I’ve learned of too many intersecting things.
 
First, there are a zillion things to do this weekend ( hooray flavorpill ):
 
  Picasso and American Art  exhibit continuing at  SFMOMA .  I saw it very briefly last weekend but want some more.  And Doug claims there’s an interesting photography exhibit there too.
  Reading from  We Don’t Need Another Wave: Dispatches from the Next Generation of Feminists , a fascinating looking book I’ve seen many times in the bookstores around here.  By that I mean at least Modern Times (the neat Mission bookstore) and the Anarchist Collective Bookstore (out on the Haight).  And the reading is at Modern Times,  just down the street  from my house!  Amazing.  Tomorrow at 7:30.
  Since anarchists were just mentioned, fortuitously there also appears: the  Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair  this Saturday and Sunday!  Speakers and books down by Golden Gate Park, oh my.

<p>Introduction: Herbert Gintis thinks  it’s time to unify the behavioral sciences. Sociology, economics, political science, human biology, anthropology and others all study the same thing, but each is based on different incompatible models of individual human behavior. There seems to be evidence that new developments have the potential to offer a more unifying theory. Evolutionary biology should be the basis of understanding much of human behavior. Rational choice and game theoretic frameworks are finding greater acceptance beyond economics; in the meantime, other fields need to absorb sociology’s emphasis on socialization — that people do things or understand the world in a way taught by society. The human behavioral sciences are still rife with many smaller inconsistencies; for example, according to Gintis, only anthropolgists look at the influence of culture across groups, but only sociologists look at culture within groups.
 
Gintis’ ultimate goal is to have a common baseline from which each disci</p><p>4 0.73897666 <a title="129-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2013/brendan_oconnor_ai-2013-02-23-Wasserman_on_Stats_vs_ML%2C_and_previous_comparisons.html">191 brendan oconnor ai-2013-02-23-Wasserman on Stats vs ML, and previous comparisons</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Larry Wasserman has a new position paper (forthcoming 2013) with a great comparison the Statistics and Machine Learning research cultures,  “Rise of the Machines” .  He has a very conciliatory view in terms of intellectual content, and a very pro-ML take on the research cultures.  Central to his argument is that ML has recently adopted rigorous statistical concepts, and the fast-moving conference culture (and heavy publishing by its grad students) have helped with this and other good innovations.  (I agree with a comment from Sinead that he’s going a little easy on ML, but it’s certainly worth a read.)
 
There’s now a little history of “Statistics vs Machine Learning” position papers that this can be compared to.  A classic is Leo Breiman (2001),  “Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures” , which isn’t exactly about stats vs. ML, but is about the focus on modeling vs algorithms, and maybe about description vs. prediction.

<p>Introduction: This is my idea based off of  Bernheim and Rangel’s  model of addict decision-making .  It’s a really neat model; it manages to relax rationality to allow someone to do something they don’t want to do because they’re addicted to it.  [Rationality assumes a nice well-ordered set of preferences; this model hypothesizes as distinction between emotional "liking" and cognitive, forward "wanting" that can conflict.]  The model is mathematically tractable, it can be used for public welfare analysis, and to top it off — it’s got neuroscientific grounding!
 
It appears to me there are two big criticisms of the economics discipline’s assumptions.  One of course is rationality.  The second has to do with the perfect structure of the market and environment that shapes both preferences and the ability to exercise them.  One critique is about social structure: consumers are not atomistic individual units, but rather exchange information and ideas along networks of patterned social relations.

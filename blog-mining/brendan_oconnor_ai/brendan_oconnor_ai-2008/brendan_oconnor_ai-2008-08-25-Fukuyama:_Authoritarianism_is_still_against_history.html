<p>Introduction: Before I forget — a while back I read a terrific Foreign Affairs article,  The Return of Authoritarian Great Powers .  The argument is, just a century or so ago, states based on authoritarian capitalism were very powerful in the world; e.g. imperial Japan and Germany.  They got plenty of the economic benefits of capitalism but not so much the democratic effects people like to talk about today.

The author argues this looks like the future: Russia and China are becoming economically strong world powers but keeping solidly non-democratic ways of governance.  The period of liberal democracy we live in, with all its overhyped speculation about the inevitable spread democracy and free market capitalism — say, an  “end of history”  — might just be that, a moment caused by the vagaries of 20th century history.

<p>Introduction: This is fascinating — In China,  you can get fined if you make a map of China without Taiwan or other disputed territories .  Reminds me of being confused trying to find the primary airline of China.
 
   
 
Based of vague recollections of its name, I searched Google for  {{ china air }} .  The first hit was for  China Airlines .  But the second hit was  Air China .  The first is the state carrier of the ROC (Taiwan), the second is the PRC (mainland China).  Turns out my intended concept, “Official Chinese airline”, isn’t a coherent concept if your political worldview includes both the ROC and PRC as entities.  But maybe what I should have wanted was just airlines that fly around East Asia and various parts of China; in that case, getting both airlines is the right thing to do.  At least Google got them both at the top of the list.

<p>Introduction: Sometimes it seems bad countries come with long names.  North Korea is “People’s Democratic Republic of Korea”, Libya is “Great Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya”, and the like.  But on the other hand, there’s plenty of counter-examples — it’s the “United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland” and “Republic of Cuba”, after all.  Do long names with good-sounding adjectives correspond with non-democratic governments?
 
Fortunately, this can be tested.  First, what words are out there?  From the  CIA Factbook’s  data on long form names, here are some of the most popular words used by today’s countries, listed with the number of occurrences across all 194 names.  I limited to tokens that appear >= 3 times.  A majority of countries are Republics, while there are some Kingdoms, and even a few Democracies.

<p>Introduction: The latest on the world ideologies front –
 
In the light of Russia’s Georgia adventures, there’s been lots of talk whether this represents a new rise of authoritarian Russia, which is presumably another nail in the coffin for U.S.-led liberal democratic hegemony in the world.  Our “end of history” friend Francis Fukuyama just wrote an op-ed arguing that  Russia and China are still not big threats to liberal democracy .  There are some good points: Russia is behaving as an aggressive imperial power, but does not embrace a grand, exportable ideology with universal appeal.  Similarly with China.  They both still feel the need to pay lip service to democratic rituals and norms.  Even Nicholas Kristof’s hilarious column  chronicling his experience with China’s dubious protest registration system  concludes that even a pale mockery of democracy is progress.
 
I still like Azar Gat’s article which I wrote about last year, that  Russia and China represent authoritarian capitalism, which will</p><p>2 0.98337215 <a title="112-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2011/brendan_oconnor_ai-2011-04-08-Rough_binomial_confidence_intervals.html">167 brendan oconnor ai-2011-04-08-Rough binomial confidence intervals</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I made this table a while ago and find it handy: for example, looking at a table of percentages and trying to figure out what’s meaningful or not. Why run a test if you can estimate it in your head?

<p>Introduction: R is notoriously hard to learn, but there was just an effort  [1]   [2]  to populate the programming question-and-answer website  StackOverflow with content for the R language .
 
Amusingly, one of the most useful intro questions is:  How to search for “R” materials? 
 
 Mike Driscoll  (who organized an in-person conference event to get this bootstrapped) pointed out that in many ways StackOverflow is a nicer forum for help than a mailing list.  (i.e. the impressive but hard-to-approach  R-help .)  It’s more organized, easier to browse, and repetition and wrong answers can get downvoted.  (And  more thoughts from John Cook .)</p><p>4 0.94802177 <a title="112-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-04-06-a_regression_slope_is_a_weighted_average_of_pairs%E2%80%99_slopes%21.html">100 brendan oconnor ai-2008-04-06-a regression slope is a weighted average of pairs’ slopes!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wow, this is pretty cool:
 
 
 
From an  Andrew Gelman article  on summaring a linear regression as a simple difference between upper and lower categories.  I get the impression there are lots of weird misunderstood corners of linear models… (e.g. that “least squares regression” is a maximum likelihood estimator for a linear model with normal noise… I know so many people who didn’t learn that from their stats whatever course, and therefore find it mystifying why squared error should be used…  see this  other post from Gelman .)</p><p>5 0.78400391 <a title="112-lda-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2011/brendan_oconnor_ai-2011-10-05-Be_careful_with_dictionary-based_text_analysis.html">176 brendan oconnor ai-2011-10-05-Be careful with dictionary-based text analysis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: OK, everyone loves to run dictionary methods for sentiment and other text analysis — counting words from a predefined lexicon in a big corpus, in order to explore or test hypotheses about the corpus.  In particular, this is often done for sentiment analysis: count positive and negative words (according to a sentiment polarity lexicon, which was derived from human raters or previous researchers’ intuitions), and then proclaim the output yields sentiment levels of the documents.  More and more papers come out every day that do this.   I’ve done this myself.   It’s interesting and fun, but it’s easy to get a bunch of meaningless numbers if you don’t carefully validate what’s going on.  There are certainly good studies in this area that do further validation and analysis, but it’s hard to trust a study that just presents a graph with a few overly strong speculative claims as to its meaning.  This happens more than it ought to.

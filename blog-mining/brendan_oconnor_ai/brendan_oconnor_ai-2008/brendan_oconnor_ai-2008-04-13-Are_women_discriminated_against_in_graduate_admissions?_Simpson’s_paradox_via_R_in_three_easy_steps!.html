<p>Introduction: Freud Is Widely Taught at Universities, Except in the Psychology Department :
  
PSYCHOANALYSIS and its ideas about the unconscious mind have spread to every nook and cranny of the culture from Salinger to “South Park,” from Fellini to foreign policy. Yet if you want to learn about psychoanalysis at the nation’s top universities, one of the last places to look may be the psychology department.


A new report by the American Psychoanalytic Association has found that while psychoanalysis — or what purports to be psychoanalysis — is alive and well in literature, film, history and just about every other subject in the humanities, psychology departments and textbooks treat it as “desiccated and dead,” a historical artifact instead of “an ongoing movement and a living, evolving process.”
  
I’ve been wondering about this for a while, ever since I heard someone describe Freud as “one of the greatest humanists who ever lived.”  I’m pretty sure he didn’t think of himself that way.

<p>Introduction: One of my favorite R tricks is  scan() .  I was using it to verify whether I wrote a sampler recently, which was supposed to output numbers uniformly between 1 and 100 into a logfile; this loads the logfile, counts the different outcomes, and plots.
 
 plot(table(scan(“log”))) 
 
As the logfile was growing, I kept replotting it and found it oddly compelling.
 
 
 
This was useful: in fact, an early version had an off-by-one bug, immediately obvious  from the plot .  And of course,  chisq.test(table(scan(“log”)))  does a null-hypothesis to check uniformity.</p><p>5 0.048978589 <a title="101-tfidf-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-03-15-Feminists%2C_anarchists%2C_computational_complexity%2C_bounded_rationality%2C_nethack%2C_and_other_things_to_do.html">53 brendan oconnor ai-2007-03-15-Feminists, anarchists, computational complexity, bounded rationality, nethack, and other things to do</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was planning to write some  WordNet  lookup code tonight.  But instead I’ve learned of too many intersecting things.
 
First, there are a zillion things to do this weekend ( hooray flavorpill ):
 
  Picasso and American Art  exhibit continuing at  SFMOMA .  I saw it very briefly last weekend but want some more.  And Doug claims there’s an interesting photography exhibit there too.
  Reading from  We Don’t Need Another Wave: Dispatches from the Next Generation of Feminists , a fascinating looking book I’ve seen many times in the bookstores around here.  By that I mean at least Modern Times (the neat Mission bookstore) and the Anarchist Collective Bookstore (out on the Haight).  And the reading is at Modern Times,  just down the street  from my house!  Amazing.  Tomorrow at 7:30.
  Since anarchists were just mentioned, fortuitously there also appears: the  Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair  this Saturday and Sunday!  Speakers and books down by Golden Gate Park, oh my.

<p>Introduction: Update:  Charles Franklin (of Pollster.com) kindly emailed me with many interesting points on this post.  One important note is that my technique isn’t really “no smoothing” — rather, there is now implicit smoothing within the polling houses, by assuming that responses are evenly distributed across the time interval of the poll.
   I was looking at Pollster.com’s page that aggregates many opinion polls on the Presidential race.    Here, they have a chart   that shows the many polls plus lowess fits: 
   
 
So there’s a trend of Obama recently declining.  But it wasn’t clear to me that the fitted curve was correct.  I downloaded the data and started playing around with it.
 
Here are several more graphs I made, with different smoothing parameters for the lowess fit.  Your interpretation completely changes depending which smoothing parameter you like best!

<p>Introduction: When possible, I like to use R for its really, really good statistical visualization capabilities.  I’m doing a modeling project in Python right now (R is too slow, bad at large data, bad at structured data, etc.), and in comparison to base R, the matplotlib library is just painful.  I wrote a toy  Metropolis  sampler for a  triangle distribution  and all I want to see is whether it looks like it’s working.  For the same dataset, here are histograms with default settings.  (Python:  pylab.hist(d) , R:  hist(d) )
 
   
 
I want to know whether my Metropolis sampler is working; those two plots give a very different idea.  Of course, you could say this is an unfair comparison, since matplotlib is only using 10 bins, while R is using 18 here — and it’s always important to vary the bin size a few times when looking at histograms.  But R’s defaults really are better: it actually uses an adaptive bin size, and the heuristic worked, choosing a reasonable number for the data.  The  hist()  manu</p><p>5 0.47449306 <a title="101-lsi-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2014/brendan_oconnor_ai-2014-04-26-Replot%3A_departure_delays_vs_flight_time_speed-up.html">204 brendan oconnor ai-2014-04-26-Replot: departure delays vs flight time speed-up</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here’s a re-plotting of a graph in  this 538 post .  It’s looking at whether pilots speed up the flight when there’s a delay, and find that it looks like that’s the case.  This is averaged data for flights on several major transcontinental routes.
 
I’ve replotted the main graph as follows.  The x-axis is departure delay.  The y-axis is the total trip time — number of minutes since the scheduled departure time.  For an on-time departure, the average flight is 5 hours, 44 minutes.  The blue line shows what the total trip time would be if the delayed flight took that long.  Gray lines are uncertainty (I think the CI due to averaging).
 
   
 
What’s going on is, the pilots seem to be targeting a total trip time of 370-380 minutes or so.  If the departure is only slightly delayed by 10 minutes, the flight time is still the same, but delays in the 30-50 minutes range see a faster flight time which makes up for some of the delay.
 
The original post plotted the y-axis as the delta against t</p><p>6 0.45161876 <a title="101-lsi-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-02-23-Comparison_of_data_analysis_packages%3A_R%2C_Matlab%2C_SciPy%2C_Excel%2C_SAS%2C_SPSS%2C_Stata.html">135 brendan oconnor ai-2009-02-23-Comparison of data analysis packages: R, Matlab, SciPy, Excel, SAS, SPSS, Stata</a></p>

Simpson’s paradox via R in three easy steps!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: R  has a fun built-in package,  datasets : a whole bunch of easy-to-use, interesting tables of data.  I found the famous UC Berkeley admissions data set, from a 1970′s study of whether sex discrimination existed in graduate admissions.  It’s famous for illustrating a particular statistical paradox.  Thanks to R’s awesome mosaic plots interface, we can see this really easily.
 
UCBAdmissions is a three-dimensional table (like a matrix): Admit Status x Gender x Dept, with counts for each category as the matrix’s values.  R’s default printing shows the basics just fine.  Here’s the data for just the first of six departments:
   >  UCBAdmissions 
, , Dept = A

          Gender
Admit      Male Female
  Admitted  512     89
  Rejected  313     19

...
 
  
Overall,  women have a lower admittance rate than men :
   >  apply(UCBAdmissions,c(1,2),sum) 

          Gender
Admit         M    F
  Admitted 1198  557

<p>Introduction: In 1994, the Rwandan genocide claimed 800,000 lives.  This genocide was remarkable for being very low-tech — lots of non-military, average people with machetes killing their neighbors.  Romeo Dallaire, the leader of the small UN peacekeeping mission there, saw it coming and was convinced he could stop much of the violence if he had 5,000 international troops plus the authority to seize weapon caches and do other aggressive intervention operations.  Famously,  he made a plea to his superiors and was denied .  (The genocide ended only when a rebel army managed a string of military victories and forcibly stopped the killing.)

<p>Introduction: This is a good idea: in a search engine’s query logs, look for outbreaks of queries like [[flu symptoms]] in a given region.  I’ve heard (from  Roddy ) that this trick also works well on Facebook statuses (e.g. “Feeling crappy this morning, think I just got the flu”).
  
  Google Uses Web Searches to Track Flu’s Spread – NYTimes.com  
  Google Flu Trends – google.org  
  
For an example with a publicly available data feed, these queries works decently well on Twitter search:
 
 [[ flu -shot -google ]]  (high recall)
 
 [[ "muscle aches" flu -shot ]]  (high precision)
     
 
The “muscle aches” query is too sparse and the general query is too noisy, but you could imagine some more tricks to clean it up, then train a classifier, etc.  With a bit more work it looks like geolocation information can be had out of the  Twitter search API .</p><p>6 0.19101495 <a title="101-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2009/brendan_oconnor_ai-2009-02-23-Comparison_of_data_analysis_packages%3A_R%2C_Matlab%2C_SciPy%2C_Excel%2C_SAS%2C_SPSS%2C_Stata.html">135 brendan oconnor ai-2009-02-23-Comparison of data analysis packages: R, Matlab, SciPy, Excel, SAS, SPSS, Stata</a></p>

That was why I was willing to be an expert witness for Sgt. Chip Frederick, who was ultimately sentenced to eight years for his role at Abu Ghraib.

<p>Introduction: Continuing  our previous story : they’ve won!  Check out the interview at the end of the semifinals here.
 
      
 
NYT  reports : 
 ATHENS, May 20 (AP) â€” In what some fans called a stunning upset, a Finnish heavy metal band with monster masks and apocalyptic lyrics won the Eurovision Song Contest late Saturday. 
 
The band, Lordi, caused a bit of a national identity crisis in Finland, where opponents accused it of devil worship and cringed at the thought that it might win.
 
The annual kitsch extravaganza, which was the springboard for the Swedish group Abba and Celine Dion, is known for its bland dance music and bubble-gum pop acts. This year groups from 24 countries faced off before tens of millions on television.
 
The band’s members do not disclose their real names. The lead singer, Mr. Lordi, said its win, Finland’s first, was “a victory for open-mindedness.” “We are not Satanists,” he said. “This is entertainment.”</p><p>5 0.076933831 <a title="122-tfidf-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-01-20-Moral_psychology_on_Amazon_Mechanical_Turk.html">90 brendan oconnor ai-2008-01-20-Moral psychology on Amazon Mechanical Turk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There’s a lot of exciting work in moral psychology right now.  I’ve been telling various poor fools who listen to me to read something from  Jonathan Haidt  or  Joshua Greene , but of course there’s a sea of too many articles and books of varying quality and intended audience.  But just last week Steven Pinker wrote a great NYT magazine article,  “The Moral Instinct,”  which summarizes current research and tries to spell out a few implications.  I recommend it highly, if just for presenting so many awesome examples.  (Yes, this blog has  poked fun  at Pinker before.  But in any case, he is a brilliant expository writer.   The Language Instinct  is still one of my favorite popular science books.)

<p>Introduction: Update:  Charles Franklin (of Pollster.com) kindly emailed me with many interesting points on this post.  One important note is that my technique isn’t really “no smoothing” — rather, there is now implicit smoothing within the polling houses, by assuming that responses are evenly distributed across the time interval of the poll.
   I was looking at Pollster.com’s page that aggregates many opinion polls on the Presidential race.    Here, they have a chart   that shows the many polls plus lowess fits: 
   
 
So there’s a trend of Obama recently declining.  But it wasn’t clear to me that the fitted curve was correct.  I downloaded the data and started playing around with it.
 
Here are several more graphs I made, with different smoothing parameters for the lowess fit.  Your interpretation completely changes depending which smoothing parameter you like best!

<p>Introduction: I started reading Jeffrey Sachs’ new book  The End of Poverty .  The first 30 pages are excellent, but it starts getting arrogant and annoying quick.  Substantively, I’m uncertain whether a big new development aid push will solve things.
 
Since I enthusiastically bum around course websites I’m not taking (bad habit, will stop real soon now), I was fortunate to run across an excellent debate between Sachs and William Easterly:
 
 Easterly’s view on Africa: The West Can’t Take The Lead  which has some amazing anecdotes about African educators and entrepreneurs.  (Or, I think they’re amazing only because I’m a condescending Westerner?)
 
 Easterly reviews Sachs .  Choice quote: 
 “Success in ending the poverty trap,” Sachs writes, “will be much easier than it appears.” Really? If it’s so easy, why haven’t five decades of effort gotten the job done? Sachs should redirect some of his outrage at the question of why the previous $2.3 trillion didn’t reach the poor so that the next $2.3 trill</p><p>5 0.43872246 <a title="122-lsi-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-01-20-Moral_psychology_on_Amazon_Mechanical_Turk.html">90 brendan oconnor ai-2008-01-20-Moral psychology on Amazon Mechanical Turk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There’s a lot of exciting work in moral psychology right now.  I’ve been telling various poor fools who listen to me to read something from  Jonathan Haidt  or  Joshua Greene , but of course there’s a sea of too many articles and books of varying quality and intended audience.  But just last week Steven Pinker wrote a great NYT magazine article,  “The Moral Instinct,”  which summarizes current research and tries to spell out a few implications.  I recommend it highly, if just for presenting so many awesome examples.  (Yes, this blog has  poked fun  at Pinker before.  But in any case, he is a brilliant expository writer.   The Language Instinct  is still one of my favorite popular science books.)

<p>Introduction: In San Francisco, it’s no secret who everyone wanted to win in this election.  Shortly after Obama’s victory speech last night, people started celebrating in the streets near my house in the Mission.  At Valencia and 19th, a big party formed and ran for several hours into the night.
     
     
  People and kids were cheering, high-fiving, playing music, and having a good time:
 
            
 
Shades of  Burning Man : There were happy combinations of alcohol, police, art cars, fireworks, and the  Extra Action Marching Band .
 
            
 
(That clip was the tensest situation I saw; after that, the police just moved everyone out of the intersection and watched carefully.)
 
            
 
            
 
I yelled “Yes we can!” and was answered “Yes we DID!”  Strangers hugged me.  I went home at 1 a.m. and the party was still going strong.  Not the worst way to celebrate making history.
 
This election was also big locally, including a tight three-way race for the local district chair</p><p>2 0.68611097 <a title="122-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-10-31-neo_institutional_economic_fun%21.html">80 brendan oconnor ai-2007-10-31-neo institutional economic fun!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: [Like medieval Christian societies,] Islamic societies similarly found ingenious ways to circumvent the usury ban.  The primary one was the  double sale .  In this transaction, the borrower would get, for example, both 100 dinars cash and a small piece of cloth valued at the absurdly high price of 15 dinars.  In a year he would have to pay back 100 dinars for the loan of the cash and 15 for the cloth.  These debts were upheld by Sharia courts.
  
The cognition of rules and ethics sure is complex.  I’d love to read the reasoning from those courts.
 
From from Gregory Clark’s  rather intense review  of  Avner Greif ‘s new-ish book on institutional economics.  (Clark’s the one who wrote that  interesting but weird  evolutionary argument about European economic development.)  If you’re in to the little worlds of institutional, evolutionary, and behavioral economics, Greif’s work is really interesting.  Along with other institutional (or is it neo-institutional?) economists, he works to und</p><p>3 0.14881714 <a title="122-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2008/brendan_oconnor_ai-2008-11-12-Disease_tracking_with_web_queries_and_social_messaging_%28Google%2C_Twitter%2C_Facebook%E2%80%A6%29.html">123 brendan oconnor ai-2008-11-12-Disease tracking with web queries and social messaging (Google, Twitter, Facebook…)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a good idea: in a search engine’s query logs, look for outbreaks of queries like [[flu symptoms]] in a given region.  I’ve heard (from  Roddy ) that this trick also works well on Facebook statuses (e.g. “Feeling crappy this morning, think I just got the flu”).
  
  Google Uses Web Searches to Track Flu’s Spread – NYTimes.com  
  Google Flu Trends – google.org  
  
For an example with a publicly available data feed, these queries works decently well on Twitter search:
 
 [[ flu -shot -google ]]  (high recall)
 
 [[ "muscle aches" flu -shot ]]  (high precision)
     
 
The “muscle aches” query is too sparse and the general query is too noisy, but you could imagine some more tricks to clean it up, then train a classifier, etc.  With a bit more work it looks like geolocation information can be had out of the  Twitter search API .</p><p>4 0.14591072 <a title="122-lda-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2014/brendan_oconnor_ai-2014-02-19-What_the_ACL-2014_review_scores_mean.html">203 brendan oconnor ai-2014-02-19-What the ACL-2014 review scores mean</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve had several people ask me what the numbers in  ACL  reviews mean — and I can’t find anywhere online where they’re described.  (Can anyone point this out if it is somewhere?)
 
So here’s the review form, below.  They all go from 1 to 5, with 5 the best.  I think the review emails to authors only include a subset of the below — for example, “Overall Recommendation” is not included?
 
The CFP said that they have different types of review forms for different types of papers.  I think this one is for a standard full paper.  I guess what people  really  want to know is what scores tend to correspond to acceptances.  I really have no idea and I get the impression this can change year to year.  I have no involvement with the ACL conference besides being one of many, many reviewers.

<p>Introduction: Rational choice has been a huge imperialistic success, growing in popularity and being applied to more and more fields.  Why is this?  It’s not because the rational choice model of decision-making is particularly realistic.  Rather, it’s because rational choice is a  completely specified theory of human behavior , and therefore is great at generating hypotheses.  Given any situation involving people, rational choice can be used to generate a hypothesis about what to expect.  That is, you just ask, “What would a person do to maximize their own benefit?”
 
Similar things have been said about evolutionary psychology: you can always predict behavior by asking “what would hunter-gatherers do?”  Now, certainly both rational choice and evolutionary psychology don’t always generate  correct  hypotheses, but they’re incredibly useful because they at least give you a starting point.
 
Witness the theory of bounded rationality: just like rational choice, except amended to consider computational l</p><p>6 0.14400244 <a title="122-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-06-10-Freak-Freakonomics_%28Ariel_Rubinstein_is_the_shit%21%29.html">63 brendan oconnor ai-2007-06-10-Freak-Freakonomics (Ariel Rubinstein is the shit!)</a></p>

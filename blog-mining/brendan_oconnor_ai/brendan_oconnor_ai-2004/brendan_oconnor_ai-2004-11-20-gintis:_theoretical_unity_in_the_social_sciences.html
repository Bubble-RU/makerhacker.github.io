<p>Introduction: Upload your poker hand histories to  www.pokernomics.com , economist Stephen Levitt’s fringe-of-economics project to study what are effective strategies in poker.  This absolultely makes sense to me as an economics research project, only because I’m used to thinking of economics from the view of multi-agent systems and game theory…  This is definitely all about game theory, maybe not economics.  Game theory reaches beyond the bounds of the study of goods and services…

<p>Introduction: [Like medieval Christian societies,] Islamic societies similarly found ingenious ways to circumvent the usury ban.  The primary one was the  double sale .  In this transaction, the borrower would get, for example, both 100 dinars cash and a small piece of cloth valued at the absurdly high price of 15 dinars.  In a year he would have to pay back 100 dinars for the loan of the cash and 15 for the cloth.  These debts were upheld by Sharia courts.
  
The cognition of rules and ethics sure is complex.  I’d love to read the reasoning from those courts.
 
From from Gregory Clark’s  rather intense review  of  Avner Greif ‘s new-ish book on institutional economics.  (Clark’s the one who wrote that  interesting but weird  evolutionary argument about European economic development.)  If you’re in to the little worlds of institutional, evolutionary, and behavioral economics, Greif’s work is really interesting.  Along with other institutional (or is it neo-institutional?) economists, he works to und</p><p>5 0.12949856 <a title="1-tfidf-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-09-02-cognitive_modelling_is_rational_choice%2B%2B.html">26 brendan oconnor ai-2005-09-02-cognitive modelling is rational choice++</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rational choice has been a huge imperialistic success, growing in popularity and being applied to more and more fields.  Why is this?  It’s not because the rational choice model of decision-making is particularly realistic.  Rather, it’s because rational choice is a  completely specified theory of human behavior , and therefore is great at generating hypotheses.  Given any situation involving people, rational choice can be used to generate a hypothesis about what to expect.  That is, you just ask, “What would a person do to maximize their own benefit?”
 
Similar things have been said about evolutionary psychology: you can always predict behavior by asking “what would hunter-gatherers do?”  Now, certainly both rational choice and evolutionary psychology don’t always generate  correct  hypotheses, but they’re incredibly useful because they at least give you a starting point.

<p>Introduction: Standard problem: humans lived like crap for thousands and thousands of years, then suddenly some two hundred years ago dramatic industrialization and economic growth happened, though unevenly even through today.  Here’s  an interesting proposal  to explain all this.   Gregory Clark  found startling empirical evidence that, in the time around the Industrial Revolution in England, wealthier families had more children than poorer families, while middle-class social values — non-violence, literacy, work ethic, high savings rates — also became more widespread during this time.  According to the article at least, he actually seems to favor the explanation that human biological evolution was at work; though he notes cultural evolution is possible too.  (That is, the children of wealthier families are socialized with their values; as the children of middle-class-valued families increase in proportion in society, the prevalence of those values increases too.)

<p>Introduction: I previously  posted  two neuroeconomics reviews.   Here’s a new one from this year  in Trends in Cognitive Sciences.  It’s interesting because not only does it look at using psychological knowledge to inform economics, but it also reviews work in the other direction: using economic decision and organizational theory to study brain systems.  For example,   here’s a paper  that analyzes brain reward circuitry using labor supply theory.

<p>Introduction: Herbert Gintis thinks  it’s time to unify the behavioral sciences. Sociology, economics, political science, human biology, anthropology and others all study the same thing, but each is based on different incompatible models of individual human behavior. There seems to be evidence that new developments have the potential to offer a more unifying theory. Evolutionary biology should be the basis of understanding much of human behavior. Rational choice and game theoretic frameworks are finding greater acceptance beyond economics; in the meantime, other fields need to absorb sociology’s emphasis on socialization — that people do things or understand the world in a way taught by society. The human behavioral sciences are still rife with many smaller inconsistencies; for example, according to Gintis, only anthropolgists look at the influence of culture across groups, but only sociologists look at culture within groups.
 
Gintis’ ultimate goal is to have a common baseline from which each disci</p><p>3 0.9454062 <a title="1-lda-3" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2013/brendan_oconnor_ai-2013-02-23-Wasserman_on_Stats_vs_ML%2C_and_previous_comparisons.html">191 brendan oconnor ai-2013-02-23-Wasserman on Stats vs ML, and previous comparisons</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Larry Wasserman has a new position paper (forthcoming 2013) with a great comparison the Statistics and Machine Learning research cultures,  “Rise of the Machines” .  He has a very conciliatory view in terms of intellectual content, and a very pro-ML take on the research cultures.  Central to his argument is that ML has recently adopted rigorous statistical concepts, and the fast-moving conference culture (and heavy publishing by its grad students) have helped with this and other good innovations.  (I agree with a comment from Sinead that he’s going a little easy on ML, but it’s certainly worth a read.)
 
There’s now a little history of “Statistics vs Machine Learning” position papers that this can be compared to.  A classic is Leo Breiman (2001),  “Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures” , which isn’t exactly about stats vs. ML, but is about the focus on modeling vs algorithms, and maybe about description vs. prediction.

<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: [Like medieval Christian societies,] Islamic societies similarly found ingenious ways to circumvent the usury ban.  The primary one was the  double sale .  In this transaction, the borrower would get, for example, both 100 dinars cash and a small piece of cloth valued at the absurdly high price of 15 dinars.  In a year he would have to pay back 100 dinars for the loan of the cash and 15 for the cloth.  These debts were upheld by Sharia courts.
  
The cognition of rules and ethics sure is complex.  I’d love to read the reasoning from those courts.
 
From from Gregory Clark’s  rather intense review  of  Avner Greif ‘s new-ish book on institutional economics.  (Clark’s the one who wrote that  interesting but weird  evolutionary argument about European economic development.)  If you’re in to the little worlds of institutional, evolutionary, and behavioral economics, Greif’s work is really interesting.  Along with other institutional (or is it neo-institutional?) economists, he works to und</p><p>6 0.44476467 <a title="1-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2007/brendan_oconnor_ai-2007-03-15-Feminists%2C_anarchists%2C_computational_complexity%2C_bounded_rationality%2C_nethack%2C_and_other_things_to_do.html">53 brendan oconnor ai-2007-03-15-Feminists, anarchists, computational complexity, bounded rationality, nethack, and other things to do</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Contrary to  baseless speculation , it turns out it  is  possible to have a four-player, non-degenerate RPS game.  The game below is assymetrical: B does better than others, but you don’t want to play it all the time because that makes you vulnerable to A.  By contrast, D ain’t so hot.  But if you never play D, then your opponent can get away with A.  It’s uneven, but the optimal mixed strategy plays everything with non-zero probability.
 
     
 
Notation: the arrow from A to B means that A beats B.  Everyone ties themself.  No arrow indicates a tie.  There is a tie between A and C.  The  previous analysis  indicated there is no non-degenerate 4-RPS with no ties.  This has only 1 tie, so it seems to be the best possible.
 
(This game is just the  previous one  with the link from A to C removed.  This makes it so B no longer dominates C, since C is now invulnerable from A, unlike B.)</p><p>5 0.11818189 <a title="2-tfidf-5" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2005/brendan_oconnor_ai-2005-07-01-Modelling_environmentalism_thinking.html">11 brendan oconnor ai-2005-07-01-Modelling environmentalism thinking</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It’s a human political belief model — based on Cyc!  I’m not sure logic represents how people think all that well, but seeing the formalization of ideology is fascinating.  And besides, the methodology of cognitive modelling is awesome.   The link:  
 Modeling How People Think About Sustainability

How effectively can a computer model represent the belief systems of different people? How would one go about representing a belief system using formal logic? How would that ideology react to different scenarios related to sustainable development? The author constructs the Cyc Agent-Scenario (CAS) model as a way to investigate these questions. The CAS model is built on top of ResearchCyc, a knowledge base (KB) and logical inference engine. The model consists of two agents (Libertarian and Green) and two scenarios.

<p>Introduction: Today I received my copy of  Beautiful Data , a just-released anthology of articles about, well, working with data.   Lukas  and I contributed a chapter on analyzing social perceptions in web data.   See it here.  After a long process of drafting, proofreading, re-drafting, and bothering the publishers under rather sudden deadlines, I’ve resolved to never use graphics again in anything I write :)
 
Here’s our final figure, a  k-means  clustering of face photos via perceived social attributes (social  concepts/types ? with  exemplars ?): 
   
 
I just started reading the rest of the book and it’s very fun.   Peter Norvig ‘s chapter on language models is gripping.  (It does word segmentation, ciphers, and more, in that lovely python-centric tutorial style extending his previous  spell correction article .)  There are also chapters by many other great researchers and practitioners (some of whom you may have seen around this blog or its neighborhood) like  Andrew Gelman ,  Hadley Wickham ,</p><p>4 0.57791924 <a title="2-lsi-4" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2006/brendan_oconnor_ai-2006-03-18-Mark_Turner%3A_Toward_the_Founding_of_Cognitive_Social_Science.html">31 brendan oconnor ai-2006-03-18-Mark Turner: Toward the Founding of Cognitive Social Science</a></p>

<p>Introduction: re  @andrewparker :
  
 My iPhone auto-corrected “Harvard” to “Garbage”. Well played Apple engineers. 
  
I was wondering how this would happen, and then noticed that each character pair has 0 to 2 distance on the QWERTY keyboard.  Perhaps their model is eager to allow QWERTY-local character substitutions.
  
 
>>> zip(‘harvard’,'garbage’) 
[('h', 'g'), ('a', 'a'), ('r', 'r'), ('v', 'b'), ('a', 'a'), ('r', 'g'), ('d', 'e')]
 
  
And then most any language model thinks p(“garbage”) > p(“harvard”), at the very least in a unigram model with a broad domain corpus.  So if it’s a noisy channel-style model, they’re underpenalizing the edit distance relative to the LM prior.  (Reference:  Norvig’s noisy channel spelling correction article .)
 
On the other hand, given how  insane iPhone autocorrections are , and from the number of times I’ve seen it delete a quite reasonable word I wrote, I’d bet “harvard” isn’t even in their LM.  (Where the LM is more like just a dictionary; call it quantizin</p><p>same-blog 2 0.91997045 <a title="2-lda-2" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2004/brendan_oconnor_ai-2004-11-24-addiction_%26_2_problems_of_economics.html">2 brendan oconnor ai-2004-11-24-addiction & 2 problems of economics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is my idea based off of  Bernheim and Rangel’s  model of addict decision-making .  It’s a really neat model; it manages to relax rationality to allow someone to do something they don’t want to do because they’re addicted to it.  [Rationality assumes a nice well-ordered set of preferences; this model hypothesizes as distinction between emotional "liking" and cognitive, forward "wanting" that can conflict.]  The model is mathematically tractable, it can be used for public welfare analysis, and to top it off — it’s got neuroscientific grounding!
 
It appears to me there are two big criticisms of the economics discipline’s assumptions.  One of course is rationality.  The second has to do with the perfect structure of the market and environment that shapes both preferences and the ability to exercise them.  One critique is about social structure: consumers are not atomistic individual units, but rather exchange information and ideas along networks of patterned social relations.

<p>Introduction: 10/1/09 update  — well, it’s been nearly a year, and I should say not everything in this rant is totally true, and I certainly believe much less of it now.  Current take:  Statistics , not machine learning, is the real deal, but unfortunately suffers from bad marketing.  On the other hand, to the extent that bad marketing includes misguided undergraduate curriculums, there’s plenty of room to improve for everyone.
   
So it’s pretty clear by now that statistics and machine learning aren’t very different fields. I was recently pointed to   a very amusing comparison   by the excellent statistician — and machine learning expert —   Robert Tibshiriani  .  Reproduced here:

<p>Introduction: This is off-topic for this blog but here goes.   ConnectU , a small college social networking site, has been in the news due to their  apparently weak lawsuit against Facebook , in which they claim  Mark Zuckerberg  stole their business plan and computer code back when they all were Harvard undergraduates.  (Judges involved have noted the case’s flimsy evidence; some technology commentators — as well as everyone I know — have noted that the business idea wasn’t all that brilliant or original in the first place.)  Zuckerberg, of course, went on to found Facebook and bring it to incredible success.
 
I tried to use the ConnectU site recently, but got an error when searching for a funny name with an apostrophe,  o’connor .  It turns out this was symptomatic of a very grave security flaw in their code, an  SQL injection vulnerability .  While Facebook recently had  a minor security-related glitch , ConnectU’s flaw is far more serious.  A malicious attacker could use this to easily break in</p><p>6 0.56206924 <a title="2-lda-6" href="../brendan_oconnor_ai-2012/brendan_oconnor_ai-2012-07-04-The_%2460%2C000_cat%3A_deep_belief_networks_make_less_sense_for_language_than_vision.html">184 brendan oconnor ai-2012-07-04-The $60,000 cat: deep belief networks make less sense for language than vision</a></p>

Last weekend  Yahoo  came to New York for an  Open Hack Day , and it was great!
 
I was invited to speak on a panel on  semantic metadata , moderated by Paul Ford (harpers.org) along with Marco Neumann (KONA) and Paul Tarjan (Yahoo/Search Monkey). The panel was a lively discussion, and we got some great questions from the audience.
 
After the panel, I stayed around to participate in the hack competition. Yahoo! provided a fantastic space, with free-flowing coffee, snacks, comfy chairs and plenty of Yahoo folks and other hackers around to give advice and play foosball with. I teamed up with  Diana Eng ,  Alicia Gibb , and  Bill Ward  to create the Del.icio.us Cake!

 Twitter  rocks. It’s useful for  all kinds of things , but especially for chronicling a live event as it happens, including the pre-event discussion and post-conference wrapup.
 
We’re very excited to be hosting  NewB Camp  here in Providence, RI on February 23rd. In preparation for the event,  Sara  created a  NewBCamp  Twitter account and I coded up this quick script to pull in all tweets related to the conference.
 
It examines all of your followers tweets for a particular phrase or tag, and then reposts those tweets containing the tag to its own timeline with the author’s name prepended. I’m running this as a cron job on my hosting account. You can see it in action  here .
 
This is a quick hack. It has a couple of issue that I’m aware of:

I moderated a panel at  DataGotham  with  Adam Laiacano  from  Tumblr ,  Fred Benenson  from  Kickstarter , and  Roberto Medri  from  Etsy  about being the first data scientist at a company. We covered everything from what people’s job responsibilities are, the tools they use, successes, failures, how they are integrated into an organization, and how they have hired other data scientists to join them. The panelists were concise, articulate, and intelligent.

 FoxNY  did a piece featuring me and  Diana  as hackers who use our technical powers for good, not evil.
 
            
 
There are way too few female technologists on television, and I’m happy to do what I can to show that women kick ass with code! Look for my mischievous I’m-writing-infinite-nested-loops grin in the clip where I’m programming.

  Introduction  
Swapping new images into an established layout is one trick that can keep a site design fresh.  Some examples:
  
  gettyimages  
  benstraw  
  
There are several different techniques for accomplishing this effect. A server-side program is the best approach, because you can automatically pull files from a whole directory (eliminating the need to modify code), and it will work even if a user has JavaScript disabled.
 
Unfortunately, not everyone has access to a host that supports server-side scripting. That’s okay, because the same thing can be accomplished with client-side code in JavaScript. I’ll show you how, with three JavaScript functions of varying levels of ease and functionality. First, gather two or more images that are the same size. Then read on…

<p>Introduction: Gitmarks: a peer-to-peer bookmarking system    Posted:  March 27, 2011 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog ,  projects   |    3  Comments »    
Several months ago I was looking for a command-line solution for group bookmark sharing. I couldn’t find one, so I coded up a quick python script that runs on top of git. It’s very much a hack that takes advantage of git to manage users, preserve the URL, the tags, the description of the URL (in the commit message) and also includes the content itself (so it’s grep-able later). If you put it on github, you get the additional commenting and collaboration features. You can check out my original code  here .
 
I’m very excited that  Far McKon  has picked up the project and has a great vision for where it can go. If you’re interested in hacking on it with him, let him know!

Last weekend  Yahoo  came to New York for an  Open Hack Day , and it was great!
 
I was invited to speak on a panel on  semantic metadata , moderated by Paul Ford (harpers.org) along with Marco Neumann (KONA) and Paul Tarjan (Yahoo/Search Monkey). The panel was a lively discussion, and we got some great questions from the audience.
 
After the panel, I stayed around to participate in the hack competition. Yahoo! provided a fantastic space, with free-flowing coffee, snacks, comfy chairs and plenty of Yahoo folks and other hackers around to give advice and play foosball with. I teamed up with  Diana Eng ,  Alicia Gibb , and  Bill Ward  to create the Del.icio.us Cake!

 This week we welcome a guest contribution.  Matthew Trentacoste  is a recovering academic and a computer scientist at Adobe, where he writes software to make pretty pictures. He’s constantly curious, often about data, and cooks a lot. You can follow his exploits at  @mattttrent . 
 
In Hilary’s last post, she made the point that  your slides != your talk .  In a well-crafted talk, your message — in the form of the words you say — needs to dominate while the slides need to play a supporting role.  Speak the important parts, and use your slides as a backdrop for what you’re saying.
 
Hilary has provided a valuable strategy in her post, but how should someone approach crafting such a clearly-organized presentation?  If you’re just getting started speaking, it can be a real challenge to make a coherent talk and along with slid</p><p>3 0.25715286 <a title="35-lda-3" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-01-19-Startups%3A_How_to_Share_Data_with_Academics.html">85 hilary mason data-2013-01-19-Startups: How to Share Data with Academics</a></p>

This post assumes that you  want  to share data. If you’re not convinced, don’t worry — that’s next on my list.   
 
You and your academic colleagues will benefit from having at least a quick chat about the research questions they want to address. I’ve read every paper I’ve been able to find that uses bitly data and all of the ones that acquired the data without our assistance had serious flaws, generally based on incorrect assumptions about the data they had acquired (this, unfortunately, makes me question the validity of most research done on commercial social data without cooperation from the subject company).
 
The easiest way to share data is  through your own API . Set generous rate limits where possible. Most projects are not realtime and they can gather the data (or, more likely, have a grad</p><p>4 0.24611534 <a title="35-lda-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2008/hilary_mason_data-2008-01-22-Create_a_group_Twitter_account.html">13 hilary mason data-2008-01-22-Create a group Twitter account</a></p>

 Twitter  rocks. It’s useful for  all kinds of things , but especially for chronicling a live event as it happens, including the pre-event discussion and post-conference wrapup.
 
We’re very excited to be hosting  NewB Camp  here in Providence, RI on February 23rd. In preparation for the event,  Sara  created a  NewBCamp  Twitter account and I coded up this quick script to pull in all tweets related to the conference.
 
It examines all of your followers tweets for a particular phrase or tag, and then reposts those tweets containing the tag to its own timeline with the author’s name prepended. I’m running this as a cron job on my hosting account. You can see it in action  here .

It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.
 
The tweet itself:
  
Love tech discussion but looking for a better community? Help me beta test a side project!  https://t.co/H3DYjbCy19

I created it pretty easily:
  
 First, go to  ads.twitter.com , log in, and go to “creatives”, then “cards”. 
 Click “Create Lead Generation Card”. It’s a big blue button.

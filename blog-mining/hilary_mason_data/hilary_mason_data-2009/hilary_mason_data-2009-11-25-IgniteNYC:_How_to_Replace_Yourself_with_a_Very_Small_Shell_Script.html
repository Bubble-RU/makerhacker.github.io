    I recently gave a talk at IgniteNYC on  How to Replace Yourself with a Very Small Shell Script .
 
The  Ignite  events are a fun blend of performance, technology, and speaking skill. Each presenter gives a five minute talk with twenty slides that auto-advance after 15 seconds.
 
The title of my talk is a classic geek reference (you can  get the t-shirt ). I’m very interested in developing automated techniques for handling the massive and growing amounts of information that we all have to deal with. I started with e-mail and twitter, both of which are easy to access programmatically (via  IMAP  and the  Twitter API ).
 
In the talk, I went through several of the simple and successful e-mail management scripts that I’ve developed.

Welcome! I’ve gotten several hundred e-mails about my e-mail management code. I do want to share it as soon as possible. Here are the answers to the most common questions.
  Why separate scripts?  
My philosophy is based on the unix command-line tool model; Each script should be simple and useful alone, but when combined together they become extremely powerful.
  Why don’t we have the code yet?!  
I had no idea the talk would be shared beyond the couple hundred people in the audience or that it would be so popular! I started my position at  bit.ly  the same day I gave that IgniteNYC presentation, and I also have some  other   awesome   projects  that are competing for time.

Your title slide should focus on the title of the talk. It should also include your name and affiliation, your logo if you have a cute one, possibly your blog or e-mail address if you want people to get in touch, and your twitter handle.
 
Here’s one of mine:
 
   
 
I usually mention that the beginning of the talk that if people have questions they can tweet them at me. This isn’t just because Twitter is a great way to get questions from people too shy to speak up (or who don’t get an opportunity). Here’s the hack: letting people know that you’ll be reading everything they say about your talk on Twitter makes them more likely to say nice things.
 
Further, in a multi-track conference, people who weren’t actually in your talk (or were there but not paying a lot of attention) will judge your</p><p>5 0.13769169 <a title="37-tfidf-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-07-05-Speaking%3A_Spend_at_least_1-3_of_the_time_practicing_the_talk.html">105 hilary mason data-2013-07-05-Speaking: Spend at least 1-3 of the time practicing the talk</a></p>

 This week we welcome a guest contribution.  Matthew Trentacoste  is a recovering academic and a computer scientist at Adobe, where he writes software to make pretty pictures. He’s constantly curious, often about data, and cooks a lot. You can follow his exploits at  @mattttrent . 
 
In Hilary’s last post, she made the point that  your slides != your talk .  In a well-crafted talk, your message — in the form of the words you say — needs to dominate while the slides need to play a supporting role.  Speak the important parts, and use your slides as a backdrop for what you’re saying.

<p>Introduction: IgniteNYC: How to Replace Yourself with a Very Small Shell Script    Posted:  November 25, 2009 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog ,  Presentations   |  Tags:   email ,  ignitenyc ,  presentations ,  scripts  |    15  Comments »    
    I recently gave a talk at IgniteNYC on  How to Replace Yourself with a Very Small Shell Script .
 
The  Ignite  events are a fun blend of performance, technology, and speaking skill. Each presenter gives a five minute talk with twenty slides that auto-advance after 15 seconds.
 
The title of my talk is a classic geek reference (you can  get the t-shirt ). I’m very interested in developing automated techniques for handling the massive and growing amounts of information that we all have to deal with. I started with e-mail and twitter, both of which are easy to access programmatically (via  IMAP  and the  Twitter API ).
 
In the talk, I went through several of the simple and successful e-mail management scripts that I’ve developed.

<p>Introduction: Speaking: Spend at least 1/3 of the time practicing the talk    Posted:  July 5, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   speaking   |    3  Comments »    
 This week we welcome a guest contribution.  Matthew Trentacoste  is a recovering academic and a computer scientist at Adobe, where he writes software to make pretty pictures. He’s constantly curious, often about data, and cooks a lot. You can follow his exploits at  @mattttrent . 
 
In Hilary’s last post, she made the point that  your slides != your talk .  In a well-crafted talk, your message — in the form of the words you say — needs to dominate while the slides need to play a supporting role.  Speak the important parts, and use your slides as a backdrop for what you’re saying.
 
Hilary has provided a valuable strategy in her post, but how should someone approach crafting such a clearly-organized presentation?  If you’re just getting started speaking, it can be a real challenge to make a coherent talk and along with slid</p><p>3 0.2953324 <a title="37-lda-3" href="../hilary_mason_data-2009/hilary_mason_data-2009-01-31-WordPress_tip%3A_Move_comments_from_one_post_to_another_post.html">24 hilary mason data-2009-01-31-WordPress tip: Move comments from one post to another post</a></p>
<p>Introduction: WordPress tip: Move comments from one post to another post    Posted:  January 31, 2009 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   tips ,  wordpress  |    3  Comments »    
I recently ended up with two posts on this site about the same project — one was a short summary, and the other a long, detailed article. I decided to consolidate them into the longer article, but I didn’t want to lose the six comments that had been posted to the short article.
 
I couldn’t find a way in the WordPress UI to move comments from one post to another, so I jumped into the database. If you run WordPress on a host, they probably provide a MySQL management tool like PHPMyAdmin, or you can log in with a mysql client.
 
First, find the table that contains the posts for your blog (the table name usually ends in  _posts ). Find the ID that matches the post you want to move comments  from , and the ID for the post that you want to move comments  to .
 
Note: An easy way to do this is to search by t</p><p>4 0.2931639 <a title="37-lda-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2009/hilary_mason_data-2009-10-16-Data%3A_first_and_last_names_from_the_US_Census.html">34 hilary mason data-2009-10-16-Data: first and last names from the US Census</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Data: first and last names from the US Census    Posted:  October 16, 2009 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   data ,  dataset ,  mysql ,  sql  |    1  Comment »    
I’ve found myself in need of a name distribution for a few projects recently, so I thought I would post it here so I won’t have to go looking for it again.
 
The data is available from the US Census Bureau (from 1990 census)  here , and I have it here in a friendly MySQL *.sql format (it will create the tables and insert the data). There are three tables: male first names, female first names, and surnames.
 
I’ve noted several issues in the data that are likely the result of typos, so make sure to do your own validation if your application requires it.
 
The format is simple:
  
 the name 
 frequency (percentage of people in the sampled population with that name) 
 cumulative frequency (as you read down the list, the percentage of total population covered) 
 rank

<p>Introduction: One Random Tweet, please.    Posted:  February 18, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   projects   |    4  Comments »         One random tweet.
  
It’s easy to believe that other people use social networks in the same way that you do. Your friends largely  do  use them the same way, which gives us an even more biased perspective.

 
Unfortunately, most networks don’t provide a way to explore representative communications that you’re not connected to.
 
Well, now you can!  One random tweet , please.
 
 Update:  There were some slight technical difficulties due to hitting Twitter’s oembed rate limit. They should be repaired now.
  (Note: between this and  bookbookgoose.com  I’m on a bit of a random kick lately. There’s a method to this madness!)</p><p>6 0.28166208 <a title="37-lda-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-08-21-What_do_you_read_that_changes_the_way_you_think%3F.html">60 hilary mason data-2011-08-21-What do you read that changes the way you think?</a></p>

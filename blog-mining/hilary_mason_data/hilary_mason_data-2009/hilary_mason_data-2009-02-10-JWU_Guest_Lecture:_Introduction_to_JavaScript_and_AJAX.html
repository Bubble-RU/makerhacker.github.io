I like to read. I love bookstores, I like to wander, and to find things that I didn’t know existed. But bookstores don’t have every book that exists. Amazon has most books, but search is a terrible way to discover new things. Amazon’s recommendations most likely maximize purchases, but are a terrible way to find something you didn’t know you were looking for (look at a book like  Effective JavaScript , for example, and you get recommendations for  Async JavaScript ,  Building Node Applications with MongoDB and Backbone ,  JavaScript Enlightenment ). Similarly, top 100 lists are great at showing you popular things that you’re probably more likely to buy, but not very good at helping you find a book with a story or idea that’s unlike anything you’ve read lately.
 
There must be a better way to explore books.

  Introduction  
Swapping new images into an established layout is one trick that can keep a site design fresh.  Some examples:
  
  gettyimages  
  benstraw  
  
There are several different techniques for accomplishing this effect. A server-side program is the best approach, because you can automatically pull files from a whole directory (eliminating the need to modify code), and it will work even if a user has JavaScript disabled.
 
Unfortunately, not everyone has access to a host that supports server-side scripting. That’s okay, because the same thing can be accomplished with client-side code in JavaScript. I’ll show you how, with three JavaScript functions of varying levels of ease and functionality. First, gather two or more images that are the same size. Then read on…

<p>Introduction: Speaking: Spend at least 1/3 of the time practicing the talk    Posted:  July 5, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   speaking   |    3  Comments »    
 This week we welcome a guest contribution.  Matthew Trentacoste  is a recovering academic and a computer scientist at Adobe, where he writes software to make pretty pictures. He’s constantly curious, often about data, and cooks a lot. You can follow his exploits at  @mattttrent . 
 
In Hilary’s last post, she made the point that  your slides != your talk .  In a well-crafted talk, your message — in the form of the words you say — needs to dominate while the slides need to play a supporting role.  Speak the important parts, and use your slides as a backdrop for what you’re saying.
 
Hilary has provided a valuable strategy in her post, but how should someone approach crafting such a clearly-organized presentation?  If you’re just getting started speaking, it can be a real challenge to make a coherent talk and along with slid</p><p>5 0.051222011 <a title="25-tfidf-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2012/hilary_mason_data-2012-03-17-Short_URLs%2C_Big_Fun%3A_I_spoke_at_dropbox%21.html">72 hilary mason data-2012-03-17-Short URLs, Big Fun: I spoke at dropbox!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: IgniteNYC: How to Replace Yourself with a Very Small Shell Script    Posted:  November 25, 2009 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog ,  Presentations   |  Tags:   email ,  ignitenyc ,  presentations ,  scripts  |    15  Comments »    
    I recently gave a talk at IgniteNYC on  How to Replace Yourself with a Very Small Shell Script .
 
The  Ignite  events are a fun blend of performance, technology, and speaking skill. Each presenter gives a five minute talk with twenty slides that auto-advance after 15 seconds.
 
The title of my talk is a classic geek reference (you can  get the t-shirt ). I’m very interested in developing automated techniques for handling the massive and growing amounts of information that we all have to deal with. I started with e-mail and twitter, both of which are easy to access programmatically (via  IMAP  and the  Twitter API ).
 
In the talk, I went through several of the simple and successful e-mail management scripts that I’ve developed.

I gave the opening keynote this morning at  PyCon .
 
The one thing that everyone in the room at PyCon has in common is that we all  love  to code. I used that as the central theme of the talk, spoke about the constructs that give us joy, the history of some of our favorite patterns (they date as far back as the 60s!) and proposed that we think about the way we’ll compute fifty years into the future. There’s also a bit of fun data hacking, of course.

Your title slide should focus on the title of the talk. It should also include your name and affiliation, your logo if you have a cute one, possibly your blog or e-mail address if you want people to get in touch, and your twitter handle.
 
Here’s one of mine:
 
   
 
I usually mention that the beginning of the talk that if people have questions they can tweet them at me. This isn’t just because Twitter is a great way to get questions from people too shy to speak up (or who don’t get an opportunity). Here’s the hack: letting people know that you’ll be reading everything they say about your talk on Twitter makes them more likely to say nice things.
 
Further, in a multi-track conference, people who weren’t actually in your talk (or were there but not paying a lot of attention) will judge your</p><p>4 0.12916674 <a title="25-lda-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-08-21-What_do_you_read_that_changes_the_way_you_think%3F.html">60 hilary mason data-2011-08-21-What do you read that changes the way you think?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What do you read that changes the way you think?    Posted:  August 21, 2011 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   books ,  philosophy ,  reading  |    24  Comments »    
A friend asked me which of three startup business books she should read.  Obama’s reading list since entering office  has nothing surprising on it.
 
The most valuable books I read this year have been stories of things very different from what I spend most of my time thinking about.
 
One of my favorites was China Meiville’s  The City & The City , which I loved for the ambition and artistry, and another was Simon Winchester’s  The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary , which I loved for the descriptions of creating an analog, scalable information system.
 
What have you read recently that was really great?
 
 Edit:  Thanks for the recommendations! There are also a bunch over on  Google Plus .</p><p>5 0.12892675 <a title="25-lda-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-02-18-One_Random_Tweet%2C_please..html">90 hilary mason data-2013-02-18-One Random Tweet, please.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One Random Tweet, please.    Posted:  February 18, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   projects   |    4  Comments »         One random tweet.
  
It’s easy to believe that other people use social networks in the same way that you do. Your friends largely  do  use them the same way, which gives us an even more biased perspective.

 
Unfortunately, most networks don’t provide a way to explore representative communications that you’re not connected to.
 
Well, now you can!  One random tweet , please.
 
 Update:  There were some slight technical difficulties due to hitting Twitter’s oembed rate limit. They should be repaired now.
  (Note: between this and  bookbookgoose.com  I’m on a bit of a random kick lately. There’s a method to this madness!)</p><p>6 0.12853327 <a title="25-lda-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2009/hilary_mason_data-2009-10-16-Data%3A_first_and_last_names_from_the_US_Census.html">34 hilary mason data-2009-10-16-Data: first and last names from the US Census</a></p>

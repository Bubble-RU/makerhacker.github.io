I gave a talk at BarCampNYC4 on Saturday on common data problems and a very light overview of algorithms that address them.

I delivered the majority of the content verbally, by talking through examples of problems and how to solve them, so there’s no guarantee that these slides will make sense, but they might be funny!

I gave a talk at the  NYC Python Meetup  on July 29 on  Practical Data Analysis in Python .

 
I tend to use my slides for visual representations of the concepts I’m discussing, so there’s a lot of content that was in the presentation that you unfortunately won’t see here.
 
The talk starts with the immense opportunities for knowledge derived from data. I spent some time showing data systems ‘in the wild’ along with the appropriate algorithmic vocabulary (for example,  amazon.com ‘s ‘books you might like’ feature is a  recommender system ).

<p>Introduction: Speaking: Spend at least 1/3 of the time practicing the talk    Posted:  July 5, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   speaking   |    3  Comments »    
 This week we welcome a guest contribution.  Matthew Trentacoste  is a recovering academic and a computer scientist at Adobe, where he writes software to make pretty pictures. He’s constantly curious, often about data, and cooks a lot. You can follow his exploits at  @mattttrent . 
 
In Hilary’s last post, she made the point that  your slides != your talk .  In a well-crafted talk, your message — in the form of the words you say — needs to dominate while the slides need to play a supporting role.  Speak the important parts, and use your slides as a backdrop for what you’re saying.
 
Hilary has provided a valuable strategy in her post, but how should someone approach crafting such a clearly-organized presentation?  If you’re just getting started speaking, it can be a real challenge to make a coherent talk and along with slid</p><p>5 0.10588939 <a title="30-tfidf-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-06-14-Speaking%3A_Your_Slides_%21%3D_Your_Talk.html">104 hilary mason data-2013-06-14-Speaking: Your Slides != Your Talk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Speaking: Your Slides != Your Talk    Posted:  June 14, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   speaking   |  Tags:   design ,  obama ,  slides  |   Leave a comment »    
Slides are the supporting structure for your talk,  not the main event . Speak the meaty and informative portion of the presentation out loud and use slides as a backdrop to set either the emotional tone or reinforce the message that you are trying to convey.
 
   
 
For example, I love using this image of  Obama in Berlin  as a backdrop when I talk about the growth of social data over the last several years. In this image  every single person has a device  and is generating their own data about their shared social experience. The content of the image supports what is otherwise a fairly abstract statement, and you can feel the excitement of the crowd, boosting the excitement that I want to share about the possibilities of social data.

The first  Strata Conference in New York  just wound up. It was a five day expo of business, data, and tech, and brought a ton of great people in the data community to New York.
 
Thanks so much to Edd and Alistair and everyone whose hard work made this possible!

I gave a talk at BarCampNYC4 on Saturday on common data problems and a very light overview of algorithms that address them.
      My talk at barcampnyc4 - photo courtesy of dynamist on flickr.
  
I delivered the majority of the content verbally, by talking through examples of problems and how to solve them, so there’s no guarantee that these slides will make sense, but they might be funny!

Sanford took some excellent  notes  during the presentation.
 
There were some  very   nice   comments  on twitter.

 New York is infinite. 
 
A human can only explore a place at a particular speed. The rate of change in New York exceeds the rate at which a person can possibly experience the city, and so it is impossible to run out of city to experience.
 
 New York is a neighborhood. 
 
At the same time, New York is a mosaic of wonderful little neighborhoods. What many visitors miss and all residents know is that you rarely have to walk more than a few blocks from home for any of life’s essentials, and enough people do the same that you find yourself saying hello.
 
 New York is chaotic. 
 
You are never the weirdest thing you see. The city will give you things to think about, and more. It is never boring, and you cannot take it for granted.
 
 New York is opportunity.

Registration is open for  DataGotham 2013 , our second annual New York data community conference, September 12th and 13th. The core of the conference is a series of brilliant data practitioners telling the stories about what they work on. The content is technically-oriented but not all deeply technical, and we really welcome anyone curious about how New York companies and institutions are pushing the boundaries on data to attend.
 
We have two goals for the conference. The primary goal is to connect people in the greater New York data community who are working on interesting things. If our community is strong and supportive, we will all do better work.
 
Our second goal is to highlight the amazing working happening here, so that people near and far will realize that New York is the best place in the world to do data science.</p><p>6 0.27331746 <a title="30-lda-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2014/hilary_mason_data-2014-04-09-Come_speak_at_DataGotham_2014%21.html">116 hilary mason data-2014-04-09-Come speak at DataGotham 2014!</a></p>

I gave a talk at the  NYC Python Meetup  on July 29 on  Practical Data Analysis in Python .

I gave a talk at BarCampNYC4 on Saturday on common data problems and a very light overview of algorithms that address them.

I delivered the majority of the content verbally, by talking through examples of problems and how to solve them, so there’s no guarantee that these slides will make sense, but they might be funny!

<p>Introduction: Getting Started with Data Science    Posted:  December 28, 2012 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   advice ,  datascience ,  hacking ,  learning  |    18  Comments »    
I get quite a few e-mail messages from very smart people who are looking to get started in data science. Here’s what I usually tell them:
 
The best way to get started in data science is to DO data science!
 
First, data scientists do three fundamentally different things:  math ,  code  (and engineer systems), and  communicate . Figure out which one of these you’re weakest at, and do a project that enhances your capabilities. Then figure out which one of these you’re best at, and pick a project which shows off your abilities.
 
Second, get to know other data scientists! If you’re in New York, try the  DataGotham events  list to find some meetups, and make sure to stay for the beers. Look for groups, like  DataKind , that need data skills put to work for good. No matter how much of a beginner</p><p>5 0.10654092 <a title="31-tfidf-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-03-11-Conference%3A_PyCon_2011_Keynote%21.html">53 hilary mason data-2011-03-11-Conference: PyCon 2011 Keynote!</a></p>

I gave the opening keynote this morning at  PyCon .
 
The one thing that everyone in the room at PyCon has in common is that we all  love  to code. I used that as the central theme of the talk, spoke about the constructs that give us joy, the history of some of our favorite patterns (they date as far back as the 60s!) and proposed that we think about the way we’ll compute fifty years into the future. There’s also a bit of fun data hacking, of course.

Over at  NYC Resistor , it was getting cold, and we needed a doorbell so visitors wouldn’t be stranded outside when the building was locked. A standard wireless model didn’t work reliably (the space is on the fifth floor, just out of range), so various members generally resorted to writing their phone numbers on a sign on the front door when they were expecting guests.
 
Since almost everyone has a mobile phone already, and SMS-based solution seemed appropriate. In order to implement this we need two things:
  
 An SMS shortcode 
 A system to notify when the shortcode is triggered 
  
It’s irritating and expensive to acquire your own shortcode, but there are several services that will allow you to use one in exchange for a small fee or advertisements in your messages.

Data scientists need data, and good data is hard to find. I put together this bitly  bundle of research quality data sets  to collect as many useful data sets as possible in one place. The list includes such exciting and diverse things as spam, belly buttons, item pricing, social media, and face recognition, so you know there’s something that will intrigue anyone.
 
Have one to add? Let me know!

There are way too few female technologists on television, and I’m happy to do what I can to show that women kick ass with code! Look for my mischievous I’m-writing-infinite-nested-loops grin in the clip where I’m programming.

I gave a talk at the  NYC Python Meetup  on July 29 on  Practical Data Analysis in Python .

 
I tend to use my slides for visual representations of the concepts I’m discussing, so there’s a lot of content that was in the presentation that you unfortunately won’t see here.
 
The talk starts with the immense opportunities for knowledge derived from data. I spent some time showing data systems ‘in the wild’ along with the appropriate algorithmic vocabulary (for example,  amazon.com ‘s ‘books you might like’ feature is a  recommender system ).
 
Once we can describe the problems properly, we can look for tools, and Python has many!

Last weekend  Yahoo  came to New York for an  Open Hack Day , and it was great!
 
I was invited to speak on a panel on  semantic metadata , moderated by Paul Ford (harpers.org) along with Marco Neumann (KONA) and Paul Tarjan (Yahoo/Search Monkey). The panel was a lively discussion, and we got some great questions from the audience.
 
After the panel, I stayed around to participate in the hack competition. Yahoo! provided a fantastic space, with free-flowing coffee, snacks, comfy chairs and plenty of Yahoo folks and other hackers around to give advice and play foosball with. I teamed up with  Diana Eng ,  Alicia Gibb , and  Bill Ward  to create the Del.icio.us Cake!

 This week we welcome a guest contribution.  Matthew Trentacoste  is a recovering academic and a computer scientist at Adobe, where he writes software to make pretty pictures. He’s constantly curious, often about data, and cooks a lot. You can follow his exploits at  @mattttrent . 
 
In Hilary’s last post, she made the point that  your slides != your talk .  In a well-crafted talk, your message — in the form of the words you say — needs to dominate while the slides need to play a supporting role.  Speak the important parts, and use your slides as a backdrop for what you’re saying.
 
Hilary has provided a valuable strategy in her post, but how should someone approach crafting such a clearly-organized presentation?  If you’re just getting started speaking, it can be a real challenge to make a coherent talk and along with slid</p><p>5 0.24364737 <a title="31-lda-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2009/hilary_mason_data-2009-10-03-Hadoop_World_NYC.html">33 hilary mason data-2009-10-03-Hadoop World NYC</a></p>

Yesterday, I attended the first  Hadoop World NYC  conference.  Hadoop  is a platform for scalable distributed computing. In essence, it makes analyzing large quantities of data much faster, and analyzing very large quantities of data possible.
 
 Cloudera  did a great job organizing the conference, and managed to assemble a diverse set of speakers. The sessions covered everything from academic research to fraud detection to bioinformatics and even helping people fall in love (eHarmony uses Hadoop)!
 
I’m not going to review every session, but I saw several themes emerging from the content and conversations.
   Hadoop is Getting Easier   
New integrated UIs like  Cloudera Desktop  and  Karmasphere  mean that developers will no longer be required to use a command-line interface to configure and execute Hadoop job</p><p>6 0.23051745 <a title="31-lda-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2012/hilary_mason_data-2012-12-28-Getting_Started_with_Data_Science.html">80 hilary mason data-2012-12-28-Getting Started with Data Science</a></p>

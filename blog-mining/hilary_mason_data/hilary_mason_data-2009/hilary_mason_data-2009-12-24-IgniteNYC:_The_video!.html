    I recently gave a talk at IgniteNYC on  How to Replace Yourself with a Very Small Shell Script .
 
The  Ignite  events are a fun blend of performance, technology, and speaking skill. Each presenter gives a five minute talk with twenty slides that auto-advance after 15 seconds.
 
The title of my talk is a classic geek reference (you can  get the t-shirt ). I’m very interested in developing automated techniques for handling the massive and growing amounts of information that we all have to deal with. I started with e-mail and twitter, both of which are easy to access programmatically (via  IMAP  and the  Twitter API ).
 
In the talk, I went through several of the simple and successful e-mail management scripts that I’ve developed.

I gave a talk at the  NYC Python Meetup  on July 29 on  Practical Data Analysis in Python .

 
I tend to use my slides for visual representations of the concepts I’m discussing, so there’s a lot of content that was in the presentation that you unfortunately won’t see here.
 
The talk starts with the immense opportunities for knowledge derived from data. I spent some time showing data systems ‘in the wild’ along with the appropriate algorithmic vocabulary (for example,  amazon.com ‘s ‘books you might like’ feature is a  recommender system ).

Welcome! I’ve gotten several hundred e-mails about my e-mail management code. I do want to share it as soon as possible. Here are the answers to the most common questions.
  Why separate scripts?  
My philosophy is based on the unix command-line tool model; Each script should be simple and useful alone, but when combined together they become extremely powerful.
  Why don’t we have the code yet?!  
I had no idea the talk would be shared beyond the couple hundred people in the audience or that it would be so popular! I started my position at  bit.ly  the same day I gave that IgniteNYC presentation, and I also have some  other   awesome   projects  that are competing for time.
 
I have to admit that the trained classifiers are all based on my personal data and were also trained mostly through tweaking in ipython.</p><p>5 0.1294055 <a title="38-tfidf-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-02-11-Interview_on_Silicon_Angle_TV.html">51 hilary mason data-2011-02-11-Interview on Silicon Angle TV</a></p>

You can  catch an interview  (or see a  writeup ) that I did live from the  Strata Conference  on Silicon Angle TV! We talk about bit.ly data, politics, and touch briefly on some of the interesting problems that we’re working on.

Data engineering is when  the architecture of your system is dependent on characteristics of the data flowing through that system .
 
It requires a different kind of engineering process than typical systems engineering, because you have to do some work upfront to understand the nature of the data before you can effectively begin to design the infrastructure. Most data engineering systems also transform the data as they process it.
 
Developing these types of systems requires an initial research phase, where you do the necessary work to understand the characteristics of the data,  before    you design the system (and perhaps even requiring an active experimental process where you try multiple infrastructure options in the wild before making a final decision). I’ve seen numerous people run straight into walls when</p><p>3 0.15115674 <a title="38-lda-3" href="../hilary_mason_data-2007/hilary_mason_data-2007-08-19-Curriculum_Design_as_Software_Engineering.html">8 hilary mason data-2007-08-19-Curriculum Design as Software Engineering</a></p>

This summer, I’ve been involved in the process of creating a new undergraduate curriculum essentially from scratch. I was reflecting back on this process, and I realized the development of a robust and relevant curriculum shares many attributes with the process of developing robust and functional software.
 
Modern software development is a largely  modular  process. Each component of a system interacts with every other component through a defined interface. I see this same behavior in a degree program – each course has certain incoming requires and defined outcomes. Students navigate through a narrative of courses that must fit together to equal a bachelor’s degree. 
 
 Unit testing  is the practice of separating out each module in a software system and insuring that it functions correctly. The final system is will contain many</p><p>4 0.14608827 <a title="38-lda-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2010/hilary_mason_data-2010-04-18-Stop_talking%2C_start_coding.html">42 hilary mason data-2010-04-18-Stop talking, start coding</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stop talking, start coding    Posted:  April 18, 2010 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog   |    65  Comments »    
I read  Out of the Loop in Silicon Valley  in the NYTimes today, which explores how and why women are under-repesented in tech startups. From the number of retweets I saw and the clicks through  bit.ly  links (12,579 at the time of this posting), it’s been getting a lot of attention.
 
There are some very strong, compelling themes in this article. Computer science and engineering to have an “image problem”; the way we teach math to elementary school students is horrible and turns way too many away.
 
I don’t want to nitpick the article, but there are a few statements that reinforce the very damaging stereotypes that the article sets out to dispel.
  

“When women take on the challenges of an engineering or computer science education in college, some studies suggest that they struggle against a distinct set of personal, psycho-social issues… Even women who soldier</p><p>5 0.10100639 <a title="38-lda-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2012/hilary_mason_data-2012-08-28-How_do_you_prioritize_research%3F.html">76 hilary mason data-2012-08-28-How do you prioritize research?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you prioritize research?    Posted:  August 28, 2012 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   datascience ,  startups  |    14  Comments »    
One of the most fun and challenging parts of my job is setting bitly’s research agenda. We’re a startup, so this means prioritizing the set of questions we look into in the context of what will be most beneficial for the rest of the business, for the short and long-term, by creating opportunity and opening up potential futures. We work on a wide variety of projects, from pure research to  press collaborations  to  infrastructure  and  experimental products .
 
We always have a list of research questions way longer than we have time and resources to pursue, so we developed a process for evaluating whether a given question is worth pursuing at a particular time.
 
This is the kind of process that I’ve only discussed with several people over whisky (thanks!), but not seen written up. I initially had a much longer list o</p><p>6 0.08909025 <a title="38-lda-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-07-05-Speaking%3A_Spend_at_least_1-3_of_the_time_practicing_the_talk.html">105 hilary mason data-2013-07-05-Speaking: Spend at least 1-3 of the time practicing the talk</a></p>

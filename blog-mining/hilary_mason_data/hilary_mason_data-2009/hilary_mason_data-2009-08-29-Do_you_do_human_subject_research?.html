Dear friends and colleagues,
 
Do you do research that involves gathering data from human participants? This can be anything from marketing surveys to psychology experiments to medical science. If so, please take a short (5 to 10 minute) survey:
 
 research tool survey 
 
The results of the survey will help us design  a new platform for online human research !
 
I’m very excited about this project and would very much appreciate your input. If you have colleagues who do this kind of work, please pass it on.

One of the most fun and challenging parts of my job is setting bitly’s research agenda. We’re a startup, so this means prioritizing the set of questions we look into in the context of what will be most beneficial for the rest of the business, for the short and long-term, by creating opportunity and opening up potential futures. We work on a wide variety of projects, from pure research to  press collaborations  to  infrastructure  and  experimental products .
 
We always have a list of research questions way longer than we have time and resources to pursue, so we developed a process for evaluating whether a given question is worth pursuing at a particular time.

This post assumes that you  want  to share data. If you’re not convinced, don’t worry — that’s next on my list.   
 
You and your academic colleagues will benefit from having at least a quick chat about the research questions they want to address. I’ve read every paper I’ve been able to find that uses bitly data and all of the ones that acquired the data without our assistance had serious flaws, generally based on incorrect assumptions about the data they had acquired (this, unfortunately, makes me question the validity of most research done on commercial social data without cooperation from the subject company).
 
The easiest way to share data is  through your own API . Set generous rate limits where possible.

Last week I wrote a bit about  how to share data with academics . This is the complimentary piece, on  why  you should invest the time and energy in sharing your data with the academic community.
 
As I was talking to people about this topic it became clear that there are really two different questions people ask. First, why do this at all? And second, what do I tell my boss?
 
Let’s start with the second one. This is what you should tell your boss:
  
  Academic research based on our work is a great press opportunity and demonstrates that credible people outside of our company find our work interesting.  
 Having researchers work on our data is an easy way to access highly educated brainpower, for free, that in no way competes with us. Who knows what interesting stuff they’ll come up with?

I’m teaching a basic web design course this term that covers design concepts,  XHTML , and  CSS . The students are from a variety of backgrounds – some have knowledge of HTML, some are non-majors or non-credit students looking to pick up a useful skill, and many are complete beginners who are required to take the course as part of their degree programs.
 
Only a few students knew what a wiki (distinct from  Wikipedia ) was before beginning this project. The students were given a month to make their contributions to  the wiki . They were each assigned primary responsibility for one page at random, but were graded both on the success of their page and their contributions to other pages.
 
43 students across two sections of the class participated in the project.

<p>Introduction: Do you do human subject research?    Posted:  August 29, 2009 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   academics ,  blog   |  Tags:   headlamp ,  human ,  research ,  science  |    2  Comments »    
Dear friends and colleagues,
 
Do you do research that involves gathering data from human participants? This can be anything from marketing surveys to psychology experiments to medical science. If so, please take a short (5 to 10 minute) survey:
 
 research tool survey 
 
The results of the survey will help us design  a new platform for online human research !
 
I’m very excited about this project and would very much appreciate your input. If you have colleagues who do this kind of work, please pass it on.
 
Thank you!</p><p>2 0.2294253 <a title="32-lda-2" href="../hilary_mason_data-2007/hilary_mason_data-2007-07-30-Tip%3A_How_to_Search_Google_for_Ideas.html">7 hilary mason data-2007-07-30-Tip: How to Search Google for Ideas</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tip: How to Search Google for Ideas    Posted:  July 30, 2007 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   search  |    1  Comment »    
 Will someone please invent a way to search for ideas? 
 
Short on inspiration? Harvest ideas from the web by searching Google for  “someone please invent”  and see what people are wishing for. Using quotes around “someone please invent” insures that Google searches for that exact phrase only.
 
You can further refine the query by adding related terms at the end of the query. For example, try searching for  “someone please invent” game*  to see game-related results.</p><p>3 0.22942507 <a title="32-lda-3" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-06-22-My_Head_is_Open_Source%21.html">58 hilary mason data-2011-06-22-My Head is Open Source!</a></p>

Last night I visited friends at  Makerbot , where artist-in-residence  Jonathan Monaghan  scanned my head with a high-resolution laser scanner.
 
   
 
The  model is available on   Thingiverse  and can be printed on your friendly neighborhood makerbot or other 3d printer.
 
There are lots of other awesome models of people and things to play with, including  Stephen Colbert’s head .
 
I look forward to the emergence of plastic clone head armies!

<p>Introduction: Startups: Why to Share Data with Academics    Posted:  January 28, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |    5  Comments »    
Last week I wrote a bit about  how to share data with academics . This is the complimentary piece, on  why  you should invest the time and energy in sharing your data with the academic community.
 
As I was talking to people about this topic it became clear that there are really two different questions people ask. First, why do this at all? And second, what do I tell my boss?
 
Let’s start with the second one. This is what you should tell your boss:
  
  Academic research based on our work is a great press opportunity and demonstrates that credible people outside of our company find our work interesting.  
 Having researchers work on our data is an easy way to access highly educated brainpower, for free, that in no way competes with us. Who knows what interesting stuff they’ll come up with?

<p>Introduction: Need actual random numbers? Meet the NIST randomness beacon.    Posted:  September 30, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   projects   |  Tags:   beacon ,  python ,  random ,  randomness ,  randomnumbers  |    5  Comments »    
I wrote a  python module  that wraps that  NIST Randomness Beacon , making it simple to get truly random numbers in python.
 
It’s easy to use:
  b = Beacon()
print b.last_record()
print b.previous_record()
#and so on  
There’s also a handy generator for getting a set of  n  random numbers.
 
(One of the best gifts I ever got was a copy of  1,000,000 Random Numbers , and I’ve been intrigued ever since.)
 
Please note that this the randomness beacon is not intended to be a source of cryptographic keys — indeed, it’s a public set of numbers, so I wouldn’t recommend doing anything that could be compromised by someone else having the access to the  exact same set of numbers . Rather, this is interesting precisely for the scientific opportunities that</p><p>6 0.22242503 <a title="32-lda-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-12-18-Using_Twitter%E2%80%99s_Lead-Gen_Card_to_Recruit_Beta_Testers.html">114 hilary mason data-2013-12-18-Using Twitter’s Lead-Gen Card to Recruit Beta Testers</a></p>

I couldn’t find a way in the WordPress UI to move comments from one post to another, so I jumped into the database. If you run WordPress on a host, they probably provide a MySQL management tool like PHPMyAdmin, or you can log in with a mysql client.
 
First, find the table that contains the posts for your blog (the table name usually ends in  _posts ). Find the ID that matches the post you want to move comments  from , and the ID for the post that you want to move comments  to .

 Twitter  rocks. It’s useful for  all kinds of things , but especially for chronicling a live event as it happens, including the pre-event discussion and post-conference wrapup.
 
We’re very excited to be hosting  NewB Camp  here in Providence, RI on February 23rd. In preparation for the event,  Sara  created a  NewBCamp  Twitter account and I coded up this quick script to pull in all tweets related to the conference.
 
It examines all of your followers tweets for a particular phrase or tag, and then reposts those tweets containing the tag to its own timeline with the author’s name prepended. I’m running this as a cron job on my hosting account. You can see it in action  here .
 
This is a quick hack. It has a couple of issue that I’m aware of:

I’ve found myself in need of a name distribution for a few projects recently, so I thought I would post it here so I won’t have to go looking for it again.
 
The data is available from the US Census Bureau (from 1990 census)  here , and I have it here in a friendly MySQL *.sql format (it will create the tables and insert the data). There are three tables: male first names, female first names, and surnames.
 
I’ve noted several issues in the data that are likely the result of typos, so make sure to do your own validation if your application requires it.
 
The format is simple:
  
 the name 
 frequency (percentage of people in the sampled population with that name) 
 cumulative frequency (as you read down the list, the percentage of total population covered)

Educators  routinely discuss  how students have trouble evaluating and using the results of their Google searches. There are really two parts to this problem, though, and while it’s true that students may struggle to identify reliable sources, before we can address that, we need to teach them how to write good queries.
 
It’s that old computer science maxim:  Garbage In, Garbage Out .
 
I like to teach students how to write interesting queries by playing games. This games force students to think about the queries they are writing, and not the results. I have no scientific proof of the results, but I do know that it keeps them entertained and thinking for a while!
 
My favorite games:

Data engineering is when  the architecture of your system is dependent on characteristics of the data flowing through that system .
 
It requires a different kind of engineering process than typical systems engineering, because you have to do some work upfront to understand the nature of the data before you can effectively begin to design the infrastructure. Most data engineering systems also transform the data as they process it.
 
Developing these types of systems requires an initial research phase, where you do the necessary work to understand the characteristics of the data,  before    you design the system (and perhaps even requiring an active experimental process where you try multiple infrastructure options in the wild before making a final decision).

It’s common knowledge that academic job announcements are seasonal. In general, hiring committees are formed in the fall; they announce positions, wait a month or two for applications, then spend weeks interviewing candidates before making a decision in March or April for positions that will begin the following September. I found some data to prove it, and to possibly guide those engaged in an academic job search.
 
I was playing with  Indeed.com ‘s  job trends  feature, when I realized that you could search not only for particular skills and specializations, but for job categories. A search for “professor” reveals some nice peaks right around mid-October.
 
 
 
While a search for “postdoc” isn’t quite so periodic.
 
 
 
I can only guess that this can possibly be attributed to trends in funding for postdoctoral positions. It would</p><p>5 0.28552082 <a title="24-lsi-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-10-31-Happy_Halloween.html">67 hilary mason data-2011-10-31-Happy Halloween</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Speaking: 1 Kitten per Equation    Posted:  April 5, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   speaking   |    2  Comments »    
   
 
Use a ratio of  one cute cat photo per equation  in your talk.
 
This is a concise way of saying that a ratio of one part heavy, technical content to one part light-hearted explanation is ideal.
 
You may have to play with the ratio depending on the audience or the expectations, but people react best when they have the chance to learn something fundamentally hard and interesting while, at the same time, getting to smile.
 
And yes, DO use photos of cute things in your talks! The hack here is that people naturally smile when they look at  adorableness . If they are smiling in  your  talk they credit  you  for the positive feelings. It’s an easy way to boost people’s perceived enjoyment of your talk and to get your audience into the kind of mood where it’s easier to walk them through more complex, technical material.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.87321293 <a title="24-lda-2" href="../hilary_mason_data-2009/hilary_mason_data-2009-01-31-WordPress_tip%3A_Move_comments_from_one_post_to_another_post.html">24 hilary mason data-2009-01-31-WordPress tip: Move comments from one post to another post</a></p>
<p>Introduction: WordPress tip: Move comments from one post to another post    Posted:  January 31, 2009 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   tips ,  wordpress  |    3  Comments »    
I recently ended up with two posts on this site about the same project — one was a short summary, and the other a long, detailed article. I decided to consolidate them into the longer article, but I didn’t want to lose the six comments that had been posted to the short article.
 
I couldn’t find a way in the WordPress UI to move comments from one post to another, so I jumped into the database. If you run WordPress on a host, they probably provide a MySQL management tool like PHPMyAdmin, or you can log in with a mysql client.
 
First, find the table that contains the posts for your blog (the table name usually ends in  _posts ). Find the ID that matches the post you want to move comments  from , and the ID for the post that you want to move comments  to .

 This week we welcome a guest contribution.  Matthew Trentacoste  is a recovering academic and a computer scientist at Adobe, where he writes software to make pretty pictures. He’s constantly curious, often about data, and cooks a lot. You can follow his exploits at  @mattttrent . 
 
In Hilary’s last post, she made the point that  your slides != your talk .  In a well-crafted talk, your message — in the form of the words you say — needs to dominate while the slides need to play a supporting role.  Speak the important parts, and use your slides as a backdrop for what you’re saying.
 
Hilary has provided a valuable strategy in her post, but how should someone approach crafting such a clearly-organized presentation?  If you’re just getting started speaking, it can be a real challenge to make a coherent talk and along with slid</p><p>4 0.40464655 <a title="24-lda-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2009/hilary_mason_data-2009-10-16-Data%3A_first_and_last_names_from_the_US_Census.html">34 hilary mason data-2009-10-16-Data: first and last names from the US Census</a></p>

I’ve found myself in need of a name distribution for a few projects recently, so I thought I would post it here so I won’t have to go looking for it again.
 
The data is available from the US Census Bureau (from 1990 census)  here , and I have it here in a friendly MySQL *.sql format (it will create the tables and insert the data). There are three tables: male first names, female first names, and surnames.
 
I’ve noted several issues in the data that are likely the result of typos, so make sure to do your own validation if your application requires it.
 
The format is simple:
  
 the name 
 frequency (percentage of people in the sampled population with that name) 
 cumulative frequency (as you read down the list, the percentage of total population covered) 
 rank

<p>Introduction: One Random Tweet, please.    Posted:  February 18, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   projects   |    4  Comments »         One random tweet.
  
It’s easy to believe that other people use social networks in the same way that you do. Your friends largely  do  use them the same way, which gives us an even more biased perspective.

 
Unfortunately, most networks don’t provide a way to explore representative communications that you’re not connected to.
 
Well, now you can!  One random tweet , please.
 
 Update:  There were some slight technical difficulties due to hitting Twitter’s oembed rate limit. They should be repaired now.
  (Note: between this and  bookbookgoose.com  I’m on a bit of a random kick lately. There’s a method to this madness!)</p><p>6 0.38913521 <a title="24-lda-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-08-21-What_do_you_read_that_changes_the_way_you_think%3F.html">60 hilary mason data-2011-08-21-What do you read that changes the way you think?</a></p>

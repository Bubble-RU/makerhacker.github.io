The talk is geared toward engineers with no prior knowledge of machine learning, and it’s designed to lay out the basic vocabulary and way that we think about the world to provide an amusing foundation so that attendees will have a head start in investigating which techniques they might want to learn more about or implement.

The April edition of Communications of the ACM has an interesting article on recent advances in active learning by Graeme Stemp-Morlock.
 
In  passive learning  (a more traditional approach), you build a large training set of classified data by (often) manually assigning labels. This data is used as the basis of your analysis. 
 
In the real world, we find that generating these large sets of labeled data is often expensive and time consuming. With  active learning , you identify the most ambiguous data to label, resulting in a much higher payoff for each label defined (and fewer headaches for your labelers).
 
The article goes on to mention that active learning is being used in practice with excellent results (for example in music identification, text classification, and even bioinfo</p><p>5 0.12923165 <a title="73-tfidf-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-03-23-Speaking%3A_15_Minutes_Or_Less_Per_Idea.html">96 hilary mason data-2013-03-23-Speaking: 15 Minutes Or Less Per Idea</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Speaking: 15 Minutes Or Less Per Idea    Posted:  March 23, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   speaking   |    3  Comments »    
Let’s just admit it: very few people can pay attention to anything for more than fifteen minutes straight. Take advantage of this by never spending more than fifteen minutes on one idea during a talk.
 
That means that if your talk is 45 minutes long, you should break it down into at least three, perhaps four different ideas that you want to explore. I find it helpful to outline my talks this way on paper before I start putting slides together.
 
The ideas that you choose to explore within a talk should flow naturally together; there shouldn’t be a jarring transition. And if you find yourself belaboring the same point for more than fifteen minutes, try to break it down further.

I spoke at  devs love bacon  back in April on   Everything You Need to know about Machine Learning in 30 Minutes or Less  . The talk is geared toward engineers with no prior knowledge of machine learning, and it’s designed to lay out the basic vocabulary and way that we think about the world to provide an amusing foundation so that attendees will have a head start in investigating which techniques they might want to learn more about or implement. This talk is not an in-depth tutorial.

 This week we welcome a guest contribution.  Matthew Trentacoste  is a recovering academic and a computer scientist at Adobe, where he writes software to make pretty pictures. He’s constantly curious, often about data, and cooks a lot. You can follow his exploits at  @mattttrent . 
 
In Hilary’s last post, she made the point that  your slides != your talk .  In a well-crafted talk, your message — in the form of the words you say — needs to dominate while the slides need to play a supporting role.  Speak the important parts, and use your slides as a backdrop for what you’re saying.
 
Hilary has provided a valuable strategy in her post, but how should someone approach crafting such a clearly-organized presentation?  If you’re just getting started speaking, it can be a real challenge to make a coherent talk and along with slid</p><p>4 0.24209262 <a title="73-lda-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-12-18-Using_Twitter%E2%80%99s_Lead-Gen_Card_to_Recruit_Beta_Testers.html">114 hilary mason data-2013-12-18-Using Twitter’s Lead-Gen Card to Recruit Beta Testers</a></p>

It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.
 
The tweet itself:

I created it pretty easily:
  
 First, go to  ads.twitter.com , log in, and go to “creatives”, then “cards”. 
 Click “Create Lead Generation Card”. It’s a big blue button.

Yesterday, I attended the first  Hadoop World NYC  conference.  Hadoop  is a platform for scalable distributed computing. In essence, it makes analyzing large quantities of data much faster, and analyzing very large quantities of data possible.
 
 Cloudera  did a great job organizing the conference, and managed to assemble a diverse set of speakers. The sessions covered everything from academic research to fraud detection to bioinformatics and even helping people fall in love (eHarmony uses Hadoop)!
 
I’m not going to review every session, but I saw several themes emerging from the content and conversations.
   Hadoop is Getting Easier   
New integrated UIs like  Cloudera Desktop  and  Karmasphere  mean that developers will no longer be required to use a command-line interface to configure and execute Hadoop job</p><p>6 0.22762141 <a title="73-lda-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-01-28-Startups%3A_Why_to_Share_Data_with_Academics.html">87 hilary mason data-2013-01-28-Startups: Why to Share Data with Academics</a></p>

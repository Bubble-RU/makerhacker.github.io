I’m extremely excited about  DataGotham , a conference that I’m co-hosting with friends and fellow New York data nerds  Drew ,  John , and  Mike .
 
DataGotham is a celebration of the NYC data community, and will bring together professionals from all industries in New York that are built around data, from finance to fashion and from startups to the Fortune 500 and government. The event is September 13th – 14th at NYU, with tutorials and The Great Data Extravaganza Show (with cocktails!) at the Tribeca Rooftop Thursday evening, and a single track conference Friday. Our  speakers  and  sponsors  are all amazing. You can  register now .

Registration is open for  DataGotham 2013 , our second annual New York data community conference, September 12th and 13th. The core of the conference is a series of brilliant data practitioners telling the stories about what they work on. The content is technically-oriented but not all deeply technical, and we really welcome anyone curious about how New York companies and institutions are pushing the boundaries on data to attend.
 
We have two goals for the conference. The primary goal is to connect people in the greater New York data community who are working on interesting things. If our community is strong and supportive, we will all do better work.
 
Our second goal is to highlight the amazing working happening here, so that people near and far will realize that New York is the best place in the world to do data science.</p><p>3 0.26368409 <a title="75-tfidf-3" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-10-22-The_DataGotham_2013_Videos_are_up%21.html">111 hilary mason data-2013-10-22-The DataGotham 2013 Videos are up!</a></p>

Please join us for DataGotham 2014! We’ll be hosting the conference Friday, Sep 26th at the  Broad Street Ballroom  in the financial district in New York City. We look forward to getting New York’s data community together and having a great time.
 
The  Call for Proposals  is now open, and  we want you to speak . Our speakers come from every industry and type of background where people use data, and the best talks are ones where you tell us your real experience with a data project. What problem were you trying to solve? What went wrong? What went right? How does the story end? Or did it?
 
If you think you might have a story to tell but aren’t sure,  drop me a note . I’m happy to help you frame a successful talk, and we welcome speakers at all levels of experience.

 New York is infinite. 
 
A human can only explore a place at a particular speed. The rate of change in New York exceeds the rate at which a person can possibly experience the city, and so it is impossible to run out of city to experience.
 
 New York is a neighborhood. 
 
At the same time, New York is a mosaic of wonderful little neighborhoods. What many visitors miss and all residents know is that you rarely have to walk more than a few blocks from home for any of life’s essentials, and enough people do the same that you find yourself saying hello.
 
 New York is chaotic. 
 
You are never the weirdest thing you see. The city will give you things to think about, and more. It is never boring, and you cannot take it for granted.
 
 New York is opportunity. 
 
Everyone comes through New York, eventually.

I moderated a panel at  DataGotham  with  Adam Laiacano  from  Tumblr ,  Fred Benenson  from  Kickstarter , and  Roberto Medri  from  Etsy  about being the first data scientist at a company. We covered everything from what people’s job responsibilities are, the tools they use, successes, failures, how they are integrated into an organization, and how they have hired other data scientists to join them. The panelists were concise, articulate, and intelligent.

<p>Introduction: DataGotham: The Empire State of Data    Posted:  August 22, 2012 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog ,  projects   |    2  Comments »    
I’m extremely excited about  DataGotham , a conference that I’m co-hosting with friends and fellow New York data nerds  Drew ,  John , and  Mike .
 
DataGotham is a celebration of the NYC data community, and will bring together professionals from all industries in New York that are built around data, from finance to fashion and from startups to the Fortune 500 and government. The event is September 13th – 14th at NYU, with tutorials and The Great Data Extravaganza Show (with cocktails!) at the Tribeca Rooftop Thursday evening, and a single track conference Friday. Our  speakers  and  sponsors  are all amazing. You can  register now .
 
While DataGotham is definitely a labor of love, there are numerous reasons to do it. I believe that New York has a distinct data philosophy — the study of human behavior — that is unique and should be cel</p><p>2 0.17586657 <a title="75-lda-2" href="../hilary_mason_data-2009/hilary_mason_data-2009-10-16-Data%3A_first_and_last_names_from_the_US_Census.html">34 hilary mason data-2009-10-16-Data: first and last names from the US Census</a></p>

I’ve found myself in need of a name distribution for a few projects recently, so I thought I would post it here so I won’t have to go looking for it again.
 
The data is available from the US Census Bureau (from 1990 census)  here , and I have it here in a friendly MySQL *.sql format (it will create the tables and insert the data). There are three tables: male first names, female first names, and surnames.
 
I’ve noted several issues in the data that are likely the result of typos, so make sure to do your own validation if your application requires it.
 
The format is simple:
  
 the name 
 frequency (percentage of people in the sampled population with that name) 
 cumulative frequency (as you read down the list, the percentage of total population covered) 
 rank

<p>Introduction: One Random Tweet, please.    Posted:  February 18, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   projects   |    4  Comments »         One random tweet.
  
It’s easy to believe that other people use social networks in the same way that you do. Your friends largely  do  use them the same way, which gives us an even more biased perspective.

 
Unfortunately, most networks don’t provide a way to explore representative communications that you’re not connected to.
 
Well, now you can!  One random tweet , please.
 
 Update:  There were some slight technical difficulties due to hitting Twitter’s oembed rate limit. They should be repaired now.
  (Note: between this and  bookbookgoose.com  I’m on a bit of a random kick lately. There’s a method to this madness!)</p><p>4 0.17254519 <a title="75-lda-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2010/hilary_mason_data-2010-04-18-Stop_talking%2C_start_coding.html">42 hilary mason data-2010-04-18-Stop talking, start coding</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stop talking, start coding    Posted:  April 18, 2010 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog   |    65  Comments »    
I read  Out of the Loop in Silicon Valley  in the NYTimes today, which explores how and why women are under-repesented in tech startups. From the number of retweets I saw and the clicks through  bit.ly  links (12,579 at the time of this posting), it’s been getting a lot of attention.
 
There are some very strong, compelling themes in this article. Computer science and engineering to have an “image problem”; the way we teach math to elementary school students is horrible and turns way too many away.
 
I don’t want to nitpick the article, but there are a few statements that reinforce the very damaging stereotypes that the article sets out to dispel.
  

“When women take on the challenges of an engineering or computer science education in college, some studies suggest that they struggle against a distinct set of personal, psycho-social issues… Even women who soldier</p><p>5 0.17220148 <a title="75-lda-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-08-21-What_do_you_read_that_changes_the_way_you_think%3F.html">60 hilary mason data-2011-08-21-What do you read that changes the way you think?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What do you read that changes the way you think?    Posted:  August 21, 2011 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   books ,  philosophy ,  reading  |    24  Comments »    
A friend asked me which of three startup business books she should read.  Obama’s reading list since entering office  has nothing surprising on it.
 
The most valuable books I read this year have been stories of things very different from what I spend most of my time thinking about.
 
One of my favorites was China Meiville’s  The City & The City , which I loved for the ambition and artistry, and another was Simon Winchester’s  The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary , which I loved for the descriptions of creating an analog, scalable information system.
 
What have you read recently that was really great?

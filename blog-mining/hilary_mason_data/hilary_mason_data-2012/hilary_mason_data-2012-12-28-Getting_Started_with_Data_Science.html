I get quite a few e-mail messages from very smart people who are looking to get started in data science. Here’s what I usually tell them:
 
The best way to get started in data science is to DO data science!
 
First, data scientists do three fundamentally different things:  math ,  code  (and engineer systems), and  communicate . Figure out which one of these you’re weakest at, and do a project that enhances your capabilities. Then figure out which one of these you’re best at, and pick a project which shows off your abilities.
 
Second, get to know other data scientists! If you’re in New York, try the  DataGotham events  list to find some meetups, and make sure to stay for the beers. Look for groups, like  DataKind , that need data skills put to work for good.

Great data scientists come from such diverse backgrounds that it can be difficult to get a sense of whether someone is up to the job in just a short interview. In addition to the technical questions, I find it useful to have a few questions that draw out the more creative and less discrete elements of a candidate’s personality. Here are a few of my favorite questions.
  
  What was the last thing that you made for fun? 

This is my favorite question by far — I want to work with the kind of people who don’t turn their brains off when they go home. It’s also a great way to learn what gets people excited.

 
  What’s your favorite algorithm? Can you explain it to me?

Data scientists need data, and good data is hard to find. I put together this bitly  bundle of research quality data sets  to collect as many useful data sets as possible in one place. The list includes such exciting and diverse things as spam, belly buttons, item pricing, social media, and face recognition, so you know there’s something that will intrigue anyone.

I’m extremely excited about  DataGotham , a conference that I’m co-hosting with friends and fellow New York data nerds  Drew ,  John , and  Mike .
 
DataGotham is a celebration of the NYC data community, and will bring together professionals from all industries in New York that are built around data, from finance to fashion and from startups to the Fortune 500 and government.

<p>Introduction: Getting Started with Data Science    Posted:  December 28, 2012 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   advice ,  datascience ,  hacking ,  learning  |    18  Comments »    
I get quite a few e-mail messages from very smart people who are looking to get started in data science. Here’s what I usually tell them:
 
The best way to get started in data science is to DO data science!
 
First, data scientists do three fundamentally different things:  math ,  code  (and engineer systems), and  communicate . Figure out which one of these you’re weakest at, and do a project that enhances your capabilities. Then figure out which one of these you’re best at, and pick a project which shows off your abilities.
 
Second, get to know other data scientists! If you’re in New York, try the  DataGotham events  list to find some meetups, and make sure to stay for the beers. Look for groups, like  DataKind , that need data skills put to work for good. No matter how much of a beginner</p><p>2 0.40900186 <a title="80-lda-2" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-12-18-Using_Twitter%E2%80%99s_Lead-Gen_Card_to_Recruit_Beta_Testers.html">114 hilary mason data-2013-12-18-Using Twitter’s Lead-Gen Card to Recruit Beta Testers</a></p>

It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.
 
The tweet itself:
  
Love tech discussion but looking for a better community? Help me beta test a side project!  https://t.co/H3DYjbCy19

I created it pretty easily:
  
 First, go to  ads.twitter.com , log in, and go to “creatives”, then “cards”. 
 Click “Create Lead Generation Card”. It’s a big blue button. 
 You can include a title and a short description. Curiously, you can also include a 600px by 150px image.

<p>Introduction: Startups: Why to Share Data with Academics    Posted:  January 28, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |    5  Comments »    
Last week I wrote a bit about  how to share data with academics . This is the complimentary piece, on  why  you should invest the time and energy in sharing your data with the academic community.
 
As I was talking to people about this topic it became clear that there are really two different questions people ask. First, why do this at all? And second, what do I tell my boss?
 
Let’s start with the second one. This is what you should tell your boss:
  
  Academic research based on our work is a great press opportunity and demonstrates that credible people outside of our company find our work interesting.  
 Having researchers work on our data is an easy way to access highly educated brainpower, for free, that in no way competes with us. Who knows what interesting stuff they’ll come up with?

<p>Introduction: Need actual random numbers? Meet the NIST randomness beacon.    Posted:  September 30, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   projects   |  Tags:   beacon ,  python ,  random ,  randomness ,  randomnumbers  |    5  Comments »    
I wrote a  python module  that wraps that  NIST Randomness Beacon , making it simple to get truly random numbers in python.
 
It’s easy to use:
  b = Beacon()
print b.last_record()
print b.previous_record()
#and so on  
There’s also a handy generator for getting a set of  n  random numbers.
 
(One of the best gifts I ever got was a copy of  1,000,000 Random Numbers , and I’ve been intrigued ever since.)
 
Please note that this the randomness beacon is not intended to be a source of cryptographic keys — indeed, it’s a public set of numbers, so I wouldn’t recommend doing anything that could be compromised by someone else having the access to the  exact same set of numbers . Rather, this is interesting precisely for the scientific opportunities that</p><p>5 0.37249869 <a title="80-lda-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-06-22-My_Head_is_Open_Source%21.html">58 hilary mason data-2011-06-22-My Head is Open Source!</a></p>

Last night I visited friends at  Makerbot , where artist-in-residence  Jonathan Monaghan  scanned my head with a high-resolution laser scanner.
 
   
 
The  model is available on   Thingiverse  and can be printed on your friendly neighborhood makerbot or other 3d printer.
 
There are lots of other awesome models of people and things to play with, including  Stephen Colbert’s head .
 
I look forward to the emergence of plastic clone head armies!

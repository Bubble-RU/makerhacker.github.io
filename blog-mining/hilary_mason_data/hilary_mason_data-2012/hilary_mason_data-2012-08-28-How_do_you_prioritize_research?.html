One of the most fun and challenging parts of my job is setting bitly’s research agenda. We’re a startup, so this means prioritizing the set of questions we look into in the context of what will be most beneficial for the rest of the business, for the short and long-term, by creating opportunity and opening up potential futures. We work on a wide variety of projects, from pure research to  press collaborations  to  infrastructure  and  experimental products .
 
We always have a list of research questions way longer than we have time and resources to pursue, so we developed a process for evaluating whether a given question is worth pursuing at a particular time.
 
This is the kind of process that I’ve only discussed with several people over whisky (thanks!), but not seen written up.

Dear friends and colleagues,
 
Do you do research that involves gathering data from human participants? This can be anything from marketing surveys to psychology experiments to medical science. If so, please take a short (5 to 10 minute) survey:
 
 research tool survey 
 
The results of the survey will help us design  a new platform for online human research !
 
I’m very excited about this project and would very much appreciate your input. If you have colleagues who do this kind of work, please pass it on.
 
Thank you!</p><p>3 0.20297886 <a title="76-tfidf-3" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-01-03-Interview_Questions_for_Data_Scientists.html">81 hilary mason data-2013-01-03-Interview Questions for Data Scientists</a></p>

Great data scientists come from such diverse backgrounds that it can be difficult to get a sense of whether someone is up to the job in just a short interview. In addition to the technical questions, I find it useful to have a few questions that draw out the more creative and less discrete elements of a candidate’s personality. Here are a few of my favorite questions.
  
  What was the last thing that you made for fun? 

This is my favorite question by far — I want to work with the kind of people who don’t turn their brains off when they go home. It’s also a great way to learn what gets people excited.

 
  What’s your favorite algorithm? Can you explain it to me?

This post assumes that you  want  to share data. If you’re not convinced, don’t worry — that’s next on my list.   
 
You and your academic colleagues will benefit from having at least a quick chat about the research questions they want to address. I’ve read every paper I’ve been able to find that uses bitly data and all of the ones that acquired the data without our assistance had serious flaws, generally based on incorrect assumptions about the data they had acquired (this, unfortunately, makes me question the validity of most research done on commercial social data without cooperation from the subject company).

If you’ve had a talk proposal accepted or been invited to speak at an event, you’ll usually get a chance to chat with the organizers before you show up to give your talk.
 
While you probably have a good idea of the topic of your talk (if you don’t, that’s a post for another day!), event organizers can be invaluable in helping you frame a talk that will succeed with their audience. They are on your side and they want you to do great, or they wouldn’t be hosting you at their event.
 
These are two questions that I always ask the organizers before I speak.
 
 Question 1: Who will be in the audience? 
 
Knowing the basic demographics of the audience is necessary to make sure you’re speaking at the right level and tuning the cultural references and humor for the room.

<p>Introduction: How do you prioritize research?    Posted:  August 28, 2012 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   datascience ,  startups  |    14  Comments »    
One of the most fun and challenging parts of my job is setting bitly’s research agenda. We’re a startup, so this means prioritizing the set of questions we look into in the context of what will be most beneficial for the rest of the business, for the short and long-term, by creating opportunity and opening up potential futures. We work on a wide variety of projects, from pure research to  press collaborations  to  infrastructure  and  experimental products .
 
We always have a list of research questions way longer than we have time and resources to pursue, so we developed a process for evaluating whether a given question is worth pursuing at a particular time.
 
This is the kind of process that I’ve only discussed with several people over whisky (thanks!), but not seen written up. I initially had a much longer list o</p><p>3 0.22897215 <a title="76-lda-3" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-01-19-Startups%3A_How_to_Share_Data_with_Academics.html">85 hilary mason data-2013-01-19-Startups: How to Share Data with Academics</a></p>

This post assumes that you  want  to share data. If you’re not convinced, don’t worry — that’s next on my list.   
 
You and your academic colleagues will benefit from having at least a quick chat about the research questions they want to address. I’ve read every paper I’ve been able to find that uses bitly data and all of the ones that acquired the data without our assistance had serious flaws, generally based on incorrect assumptions about the data they had acquired (this, unfortunately, makes me question the validity of most research done on commercial social data without cooperation from the subject company).
 
The easiest way to share data is  through your own API . Set generous rate limits where possible. Most projects are not realtime and they can gather the data (or, more likely, have a grad</p><p>4 0.22876334 <a title="76-lda-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-07-05-Speaking%3A_Spend_at_least_1-3_of_the_time_practicing_the_talk.html">105 hilary mason data-2013-07-05-Speaking: Spend at least 1-3 of the time practicing the talk</a></p>

 This week we welcome a guest contribution.  Matthew Trentacoste  is a recovering academic and a computer scientist at Adobe, where he writes software to make pretty pictures. He’s constantly curious, often about data, and cooks a lot. You can follow his exploits at  @mattttrent . 
 
In Hilary’s last post, she made the point that  your slides != your talk .  In a well-crafted talk, your message — in the form of the words you say — needs to dominate while the slides need to play a supporting role.  Speak the important parts, and use your slides as a backdrop for what you’re saying.
 
Hilary has provided a valuable strategy in her post, but how should someone approach crafting such a clearly-organized presentation?  If you’re just getting started speaking, it can be a real challenge to make a coherent talk and along with slid</p><p>5 0.22779076 <a title="76-lda-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2009/hilary_mason_data-2009-10-03-Hadoop_World_NYC.html">33 hilary mason data-2009-10-03-Hadoop World NYC</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hadoop World NYC    Posted:  October 3, 2009 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   academics ,  blog   |  Tags:   conference ,  data analysis ,  hadoop  |    9  Comments »    
Yesterday, I attended the first  Hadoop World NYC  conference.  Hadoop  is a platform for scalable distributed computing. In essence, it makes analyzing large quantities of data much faster, and analyzing very large quantities of data possible.
 
 Cloudera  did a great job organizing the conference, and managed to assemble a diverse set of speakers. The sessions covered everything from academic research to fraud detection to bioinformatics and even helping people fall in love (eHarmony uses Hadoop)!
 
I’m not going to review every session, but I saw several themes emerging from the content and conversations.
   Hadoop is Getting Easier   
New integrated UIs like  Cloudera Desktop  and  Karmasphere  mean that developers will no longer be required to use a command-line interface to configure and execute Hadoop job</p><p>6 0.22361654 <a title="76-lda-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-11-22-Speaking%3A_Two_Questions_to_Ask_Before_You_Give_a_Talk.html">113 hilary mason data-2013-11-22-Speaking: Two Questions to Ask Before You Give a Talk</a></p>

I was visiting my grandparents yesterday, and my grandfather asked for help e-mailing an article to some of his friends. I asked him to show me how he normally writes an e-mail, and taught him the magic of copy and paste (it  is  amazing if you haven’t seen it before) but I noticed that in the course of sending an e-mail and checking on his inbox, he clicked on this ad three times.
 
 
 
When I asked about it, he didn’t realize he had clicked the ad — he just thought these screens popped up randomly — because he didn’t realize that his hands were shaking on the trackpad.
 
I’m sure the data says that that’s the optimal place on the screen for the ad. I’m sure tons of people ‘click’ on it. I’m also sure it’s wrong, and it results in a terrible experience.

Yesterday I asked people on twitter for recommendations for things to read to improve as a programmer. I’m looking mainly for things on the philosophy side of software engineering. I do realize that practice is the most important thing, but sometimes you run into a design question and it’s always helpful to realize that very smart people have, indeed, thought about these things before.
 
I assembled the book recommendations into a  bitly bundle . I’ve only read a few of these (generally the older books) and so I can’t recommend specifics, but if you’d care to take a look  here they are !

Last weekend  Yahoo  came to New York for an  Open Hack Day , and it was great!
 
I was invited to speak on a panel on  semantic metadata , moderated by Paul Ford (harpers.org) along with Marco Neumann (KONA) and Paul Tarjan (Yahoo/Search Monkey). The panel was a lively discussion, and we got some great questions from the audience.
 
After the panel, I stayed around to participate in the hack competition. Yahoo! provided a fantastic space, with free-flowing coffee, snacks, comfy chairs and plenty of Yahoo folks and other hackers around to give advice and play foosball with. I teamed up with  Diana Eng ,  Alicia Gibb , and  Bill Ward  to create the Del.icio.us Cake!

Great data scientists come from such diverse backgrounds that it can be difficult to get a sense of whether someone is up to the job in just a short interview. In addition to the technical questions, I find it useful to have a few questions that draw out the more creative and less discrete elements of a candidate’s personality. Here are a few of my favorite questions.
  
  What was the last thing that you made for fun? 

This is my favorite question by far — I want to work with the kind of people who don’t turn their brains off when they go home. It’s also a great way to learn what gets people excited.

 
  What’s your favorite algorithm? Can you explain it to me? 

I don’t know any data scientists who  haven’t  fallen in love with an algorithm, and I want to see both that enthusiasm and that the ca</p><p>5 0.093394399 <a title="77-tfidf-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-03-18-Be_Ballsy..html">54 hilary mason data-2011-03-18-Be Ballsy.</a></p>

The things that are hardest to make yourself do are often the ones that end up being the most rewarding. 
 
(By rewarding I mean they lead to the kinds of experiences where you learn something new, get to meet amazing people, and generally have opportunities to do things you never would have imagined doing before. Rewarding does not only mean money.)
 
I was thinking about this at PyCon, after someone asked me how it felt, as a woman, to get up and give a technical talk to approximately 1,400 men. Five years ago I couldn’t have imagined myself doing something like that, but a series of small chances, risks, and experiences have led me here. And it was a ton of fun!

Hello, and welcome to everyone who found this site via Torley’s story on the  Second Life blog !
 
I lead the  Immersive Media Lab  at  J&W; University . Several of our projects have utilized Second Life, including  Virtual Morocco  (cultural exchange and tourism promotion for the country of Morocco) and  SLMetrics  (a study of behavior modeling in virtual environments).
 
This isn’t a Second Life blog, but you will find LSL scripts and other related ephemera around.

I was visiting my grandparents yesterday, and my grandfather asked for help e-mailing an article to some of his friends. I asked him to show me how he normally writes an e-mail, and taught him the magic of copy and paste (it  is  amazing if you haven’t seen it before) but I noticed that in the course of sending an e-mail and checking on his inbox, he clicked on this ad three times.
 
 
 
When I asked about it, he didn’t realize he had clicked the ad — he just thought these screens popped up randomly — because he didn’t realize that his hands were shaking on the trackpad.
 
I’m sure the data says that that’s the optimal place on the screen for the ad. I’m sure tons of people ‘click’ on it. I’m also sure it’s wrong, and it results in a terrible experience.
 
It’s common sense, but experiences</p><p>3 0.46915203 <a title="77-lda-3" href="../hilary_mason_data-2007/hilary_mason_data-2007-07-17-Where_the_Sun_Rises%E2%80%A6_in_Second_Life.html">5 hilary mason data-2007-07-17-Where the Sun Rises… in Second Life</a></p>

The  Second Life Scripters  mailing list just had a great discussion on the cycle of the sun and the seasons in Second Life. As very detail-oriented residents may have already determined, the sun and moon in SL do not follow the Earth’s natural course.
 
Scripter Extraordinaire Zyzzy Zarf (who doesn’t seem to have a web site, but if I’m wrong, please let me know in the comments!) provided some code obtained from a Linden that indicates that the sun moves in a circle around a tilted plane. The angle of the plane rotates around each year.
 
This results in a “good enough” simulation o</p><p>4 0.41857708 <a title="77-lda-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2008/hilary_mason_data-2008-01-22-What%E2%80%99s_wrong_with_this_hat%3F.html">14 hilary mason data-2008-01-22-What’s wrong with this hat?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What’s wrong with this hat?    Posted:  January 22, 2008 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   education ,  second life ,  virtual worlds  |    8  Comments »    
   
 
The vendor containing this hat was recently deleted from Virtual Morocco by an employee of Linden Lab without any notification to me. Why? Because an anonymous person complained that it is “broadly offensive”.
 
 Virtual Morocco  was created to be both a tourism promotion platform and a space for cultural exchange. It was built entirely by undergraduate students as an educational service-learning project.
 
We give space in the Marrakesh Marketplace to several Moroccan artisans with virtual goods for sale. Our only requirements are that they keep everything appropriate to the sim’s theme and to the educational context of the space. The vendor selling the hat was owned by a college student (not from our institution) who specializes in items appropriate for the Morocco of the 1940s.

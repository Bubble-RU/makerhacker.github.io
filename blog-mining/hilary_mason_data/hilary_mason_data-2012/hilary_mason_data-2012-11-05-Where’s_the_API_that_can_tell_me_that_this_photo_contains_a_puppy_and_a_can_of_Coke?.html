This post assumes that you  want  to share data. If you’re not convinced, don’t worry — that’s next on my list.   
 
You and your academic colleagues will benefit from having at least a quick chat about the research questions they want to address. I’ve read every paper I’ve been able to find that uses bitly data and all of the ones that acquired the data without our assistance had serious flaws, generally based on incorrect assumptions about the data they had acquired (this, unfortunately, makes me question the validity of most research done on commercial social data without cooperation from the subject company).

In 2008,  cuil , a search engine startup, displayed  my bio alongside a photo  of deceased actress  Hilary Mason . In January 2013,  Bing confused us , this time putting  my photo next to her bio  (they fixed it after a suitable amount of mocking on Twitter).
 
Today,  Google did the same thing . ( live search link )
 
Today I win the internet?
 
   
 
If you zoom in on the bio section, you can clearly see that it’s her bio with a photo of me (originally from  Crain’s New York 40 under Forty ). Further, if you go into her filmography, you continue to see my photo.

This is probably the least likely thing you would expect to appear on this site, but it’s true!

I don’t usually speak publicly about the women in tech issue, for a variety of reasons, primarily: if I’m speaking about women in technology I am not speaking  about technology , it’s not a topic that I have much insight on, it ignores the other dimensions of the problem, and I would really rather work hard and be known as a great technologist than a great  woman  technologist.

I have a Google alert set up for my name, and over the weekend it sent me  here .
 
 Update:  Bing has removed the page and now redirects to a regular search.
 
It’s a page on Bing Celebrities, merging my information with information about Hilary Mason,  the (now deceased) British actress . According to this page, I have starred in movies before I was born and made videos after I died. It’s my photo and her filmography.
 
It’s creepy, but it’s also intriguing. How does this happen?
 
The data is credited to AMG and  inbaseline , whose domain, though linked directly from Bing, does not resolve. Entity disambiguation is certainly a challenge, but I expect more from Microsoft, with so much data and so many brains.

I spent a few minutes this week putting together a  quick script to pull data  from the  Locu API . Locu has done the hard work of gathering and parsing menus from around the US and has a lot of interesting data (and a  good data team ).
 
The API is easy to query by menu item (like “cheeseburger”,  my favorite ) and by running my little script I quickly had data for the prices of cheeseburgers in my set of zip codes (the 100 most populated metro areas in the US).
 
   
 
   
 
I’m a big fan of Pete Warden’s OpenHeatMap tool for making quick map visualizations, and was able to come up with the following:
 
The blue map is the average price of a cheeseburger by zip, with the red one showing the average price of pizza. The most expensive average cheeseburger can be found in Santa Clara, CA, ironically the city currently hosting the  Str</p><p>6 0.25754526 <a title="79-lsi-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-07-29-Uses_This.html">59 hilary mason data-2011-07-29-Uses This</a></p>

We’ve gotten very good at extracting and disambiguation entities from text data. You can license a  commodity system , and there are  API  and even  open source tools  that work fairly well.
 
However, a large percentage of content that people share is not primarily text (a back-of-the-envelope guess says around 18%), and we currently have very little automated insight into that content.
 
I know this is a very hard problem, but I’m continuously surprised by how few people seem to be working on it. Any ideas?</p><p>2 0.87405664 <a title="79-lda-2" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-10-10-I%E2%80%99m_in_Glamour_Magazine%21.html">64 hilary mason data-2011-10-10-I’m in Glamour Magazine!</a></p>

This is probably the least likely thing you would expect to appear on this site, but it’s true! I appear in the November 2011 issue of Glamour alongside Jess Lee, Caterina Fake, and Stacy Brown-Philpot, in a story by Kara Swisher. There will also be a panel event tomorrow morning to talk about  the article .
 
I don’t usually speak publicly about the women in tech issue, for a variety of reasons, primarily: if I’m speaking about women in technology I am not speaking  about technology , it’s not a topic that I have much insight on, it ignores the other dimensions of the problem, and I would really rather work hard and be known as a great technologist than a great  woman  technologist.

It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.
 
The tweet itself:
  
Love tech discussion but looking for a better community? Help me beta test a side project!  https://t.co/H3DYjbCy19

I created it pretty easily:
  
 First, go to  ads.twitter.com , log in, and go to “creatives”, then “cards”. 
 Click “Create Lead Generation Card”. It’s a big blue button.

<p>Introduction: Startups: Why to Share Data with Academics    Posted:  January 28, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |    5  Comments »    
Last week I wrote a bit about  how to share data with academics . This is the complimentary piece, on  why  you should invest the time and energy in sharing your data with the academic community.
 
As I was talking to people about this topic it became clear that there are really two different questions people ask. First, why do this at all? And second, what do I tell my boss?
 
Let’s start with the second one. This is what you should tell your boss:
  
  Academic research based on our work is a great press opportunity and demonstrates that credible people outside of our company find our work interesting.  
 Having researchers work on our data is an easy way to access highly educated brainpower, for free, that in no way competes with us. Who knows what interesting stuff they’ll come up with?

<p>Introduction: Need actual random numbers? Meet the NIST randomness beacon.    Posted:  September 30, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   projects   |  Tags:   beacon ,  python ,  random ,  randomness ,  randomnumbers  |    5  Comments »    
I wrote a  python module  that wraps that  NIST Randomness Beacon , making it simple to get truly random numbers in python.
 
It’s easy to use:
  b = Beacon()
print b.last_record()
print b.previous_record()
#and so on  
There’s also a handy generator for getting a set of  n  random numbers.
 
(One of the best gifts I ever got was a copy of  1,000,000 Random Numbers , and I’ve been intrigued ever since.)
 
Please note that this the randomness beacon is not intended to be a source of cryptographic keys — indeed, it’s a public set of numbers, so I wouldn’t recommend doing anything that could be compromised by someone else having the access to the  exact same set of numbers . Rather, this is interesting precisely for the scientific opportunities that</p><p>6 0.24073337 <a title="79-lda-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-06-22-My_Head_is_Open_Source%21.html">58 hilary mason data-2011-06-22-My Head is Open Source!</a></p>

I keep missing Google calendar invites on both my personal and work accounts. I’ve had my google account for years (since 2004?) and assumed it was some quirk of how I had configured something along the way.
 
Today I was following Google’s  instructions for syncing calendars with an iOS device  and discovered that if you click calendar settings (which means click the gear icon then ‘calendar settings’), then ‘calendar’, then ‘notifications’ next to the calendar that you care about, you can turn on e-mail and SMS notifications for any given calendar.
 
(I’ll save my ranting about the number of clicks to find and configuration anything on google’s properties right now for another time.)

    Google Now  is an extension to Google’s Android search app that uses all of the data that Google has about you along with what it can guess about your current context to present the information it thinks you need when it thinks you need it.
 
It’ll tell you to leave a bit early to make your next calendar event because of heavy traffic, or that it’s a friend’s birthday, or that there’s a cool cafe nearby where you are.
 
I think it’s amazing.
 
It’s amazing because this is the first Google product that takes ALL OF THE DATA that they have about us and actually makes it useful  for us . Not for advertisers.

Educators  routinely discuss  how students have trouble evaluating and using the results of their Google searches. There are really two parts to this problem, though, and while it’s true that students may struggle to identify reliable sources, before we can address that, we need to teach them how to write good queries.
 
It’s that old computer science maxim:  Garbage In, Garbage Out .
 
I like to teach students how to write interesting queries by playing games. This games force students to think about the queries they are writing, and not the results. I have no scientific proof of the results, but I do know that it keeps them entertained and thinking for a while!

 Will someone please invent a way to search for ideas? 
 
Short on inspiration? Harvest ideas from the web by searching Google for  “someone please invent”  and see what people are wishing for. Using quotes around “someone please invent” insures that Google searches for that exact phrase only.
 
You can further refine the query by adding related terms at the end of the query. For example, try searching for  “someone please invent” game*  to see game-related results.</p><p>6 0.068558559 <a title="69-tfidf-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-12-18-Using_Twitter%E2%80%99s_Lead-Gen_Card_to_Recruit_Beta_Testers.html">114 hilary mason data-2013-12-18-Using Twitter’s Lead-Gen Card to Recruit Beta Testers</a></p>

I keep missing Google calendar invites on both my personal and work accounts. I’ve had my google account for years (since 2004?) and assumed it was some quirk of how I had configured something along the way.
 
Today I was following Google’s  instructions for syncing calendars with an iOS device  and discovered that if you click calendar settings (which means click the gear icon then ‘calendar settings’), then ‘calendar’, then ‘notifications’ next to the calendar that you care about, you can turn on e-mail and SMS notifications for any given calendar.
 
(I’ll save my ranting about the number of clicks to find and configuration anything on google’s properties right now for another time.)
 
I’m sharing this on the theory that I’m not the only one with this particular frustration. I hope it saves someon</p><p>3 0.96327794 <a title="69-lda-3" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-10-31-Happy_Halloween.html">67 hilary mason data-2011-10-31-Happy Halloween</a></p>

It’s tempting to think of a talk as the opportunity to take a body of knowledge and to educate your audience about that body of knowledge. You have something in your head and you want to get it into theirs.
 
Making education your top priority leads to terrible talks, with an unhappy audience that won’t retain any of the information you wanted them to remember, anyway. Instead, think about how you can create a compelling narrative through your material, layering in the deep technical content so that the most attentive listeners will take away a deep understanding while the people who are only half paying attention will, at the very least, enjoy the experience.
 
I can’t think of any talk that demonstrates this better than Gary Bernhardt’s WAT:
 
  
 
Remember: you’re  entertaining , not  educating .

I spent a few minutes this week putting together a  quick script to pull data  from the  Locu API . Locu has done the hard work of gathering and parsing menus from around the US and has a lot of interesting data (and a  good data team ).
 
The API is easy to query by menu item (like “cheeseburger”,  my favorite ) and by running my little script I quickly had data for the prices of cheeseburgers in my set of zip codes (the 100 most populated metro areas in the US).
 
   
 
   
 
I’m a big fan of Pete Warden’s OpenHeatMap tool for making quick map visualizations, and was able to come up with the following:
 
The blue map is the average price of a cheeseburger by zip, with the red one showing the average price of pizza. The most expensive average cheeseburger can be found in Santa Clara, CA, ironically the city currently hosting the  Str</p><p>6 0.23635989 <a title="69-lda-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2010/hilary_mason_data-2010-08-15-Should_you_attend_Hadoop_World%3F_Yes..html">46 hilary mason data-2010-08-15-Should you attend Hadoop World?

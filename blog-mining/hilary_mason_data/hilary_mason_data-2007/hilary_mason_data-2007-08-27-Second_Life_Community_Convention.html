I just returned from the Second Life Community Convention in Chicago. I really appreciate all of the wonderful people that I had the chance to meet (or smeet) or just spend time with. There wasn’t nearly enough time for all of the conversations that I wanted to have!
 
There were a wide variety of presentations. We’ve come a long way since last year! The diversity of disciplines was astounding. I think the strongest work presented was in the sciences and medicine, and I was particularly impressed with the  Second Health  machinima.
 
Here are the slides from my presentation on Experiential Learning:

Hello, and welcome to everyone who found this site via Torley’s story on the  Second Life blog !
 
I lead the  Immersive Media Lab  at  J&W; University . Several of our projects have utilized Second Life, including  Virtual Morocco  (cultural exchange and tourism promotion for the country of Morocco) and  SLMetrics  (a study of behavior modeling in virtual environments).
 
This isn’t a Second Life blog, but you will find LSL scripts and other related ephemera around.

I was immensely privileged to participate in the first ever Teen Second Life College Fair. The event was on the  Eye4You Alliance  TSL island.  At least 18 institutions were represented (see some of the booths in the image to the left), and approximately 200 teens attended.
 
I gave a short presentation on my own educational experiences and the incredible possibilities for careers in technology, but my favorite part of the college fair was the casual conversations that took place outside of the sessions and in the booth area. We talked about everything from education in Europe vs the US to tagging to SL building and scripting to politics… you get the idea!
 
For educators and recruiters, this was a fantastic event for connecting with young people who are excited, passionate, and resourceful.

The  Second Life Scripters  mailing list just had a great discussion on the cycle of the sun and the seasons in Second Life. As very detail-oriented residents may have already determined, the sun and moon in SL do not follow the Earth’s natural course.

<p>Introduction: Should you attend Hadoop World? Yes.    Posted:  August 15, 2010 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   conferences ,  hadoop ,  hadoopworld ,  questions  |    2  Comments »    
I received this e-mail via my  contact form :
  

I just discovered you via a Google search because I’m highly considering attending this year’s upcoming Hadoop World in NYC. I appreciate your page that you wrote up after attending last year’s event. I’m wondering if you feel that Hadoop has enough momentum and support to be a “here to stay” technology worth investing one’s time and education into, or is it possible it might fade and be deprecated by something else as the need for big data analysis continues to grow? …

  
I’ve had a few similar conversation with people lately, and I thought posting my response might help others making similar decisions. The e-mail is referencing my post from  last year’s hadoop world NYC .

I just returned from the Second Life Community Convention in Chicago. I really appreciate all of the wonderful people that I had the chance to meet (or smeet) or just spend time with. There wasn’t nearly enough time for all of the conversations that I wanted to have!
 
There were a wide variety of presentations. We’ve come a long way since last year! The diversity of disciplines was astounding. I think the strongest work presented was in the sciences and medicine, and I was particularly impressed with the  Second Health  machinima.
 
Here are the slides from my presentation on Experiential Learning:
 
    
 
I’m hoping it inspires people to think about how we now have this capacity to create learning experiences that were simply never possible before. What do we do with it? How do we measure it?</p><p>2 0.94533747 <a title="9-lda-2" href="../hilary_mason_data-2007/hilary_mason_data-2007-08-19-Curriculum_Design_as_Software_Engineering.html">8 hilary mason data-2007-08-19-Curriculum Design as Software Engineering</a></p>

This summer, I’ve been involved in the process of creating a new undergraduate curriculum essentially from scratch. I was reflecting back on this process, and I realized the development of a robust and relevant curriculum shares many attributes with the process of developing robust and functional software.
 
Modern software development is a largely  modular  process. Each component of a system interacts with every other component through a defined interface. I see this same behavior in a degree program – each course has certain incoming requires and defined outcomes. Students navigate through a narrative of courses that must fit together to equal a bachelor’s degree. 
 
 Unit testing  is the practice of separating out each module in a software system and insuring that it functions correctly. The final system is will contain many</p><p>3 0.27079341 <a title="9-lda-3" href="../hilary_mason_data-2007/hilary_mason_data-2007-10-24-Teen_Second_Life_College_Fair.html">12 hilary mason data-2007-10-24-Teen Second Life College Fair</a></p>

I was immensely privileged to participate in the first ever Teen Second Life College Fair. The event was on the  Eye4You Alliance  TSL island.  At least 18 institutions were represented (see some of the booths in the image to the left), and approximately 200 teens attended.
 
I gave a short presentation on my own educational experiences and the incredible possibilities for careers in technology, but my favorite part of the college fair was the casual conversations that took place outside of the sessions and in the booth area. We talked about everything from education in Europe vs the US to tagging to SL building and scripting to politics… you get the idea!
 
For educators and recruiters, this was a fantastic event for connecting with young people who are excited, passionate, and resourceful.

<p>Introduction: Should you attend Hadoop World? Yes.    Posted:  August 15, 2010 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   conferences ,  hadoop ,  hadoopworld ,  questions  |    2  Comments »    
I received this e-mail via my  contact form :
  

I just discovered you via a Google search because I’m highly considering attending this year’s upcoming Hadoop World in NYC. I appreciate your page that you wrote up after attending last year’s event. I’m wondering if you feel that Hadoop has enough momentum and support to be a “here to stay” technology worth investing one’s time and education into, or is it possible it might fade and be deprecated by something else as the need for big data analysis continues to grow? …

  
I’ve had a few similar conversation with people lately, and I thought posting my response might help others making similar decisions. The e-mail is referencing my post from  last year’s hadoop world NYC .
  

Thanks for reaching out. There are several questions in your messa</p><p>5 0.2578786 <a title="9-lda-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2010/hilary_mason_data-2010-04-18-Stop_talking%2C_start_coding.html">42 hilary mason data-2010-04-18-Stop talking, start coding</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stop talking, start coding    Posted:  April 18, 2010 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog   |    65  Comments »    
I read  Out of the Loop in Silicon Valley  in the NYTimes today, which explores how and why women are under-repesented in tech startups. From the number of retweets I saw and the clicks through  bit.ly  links (12,579 at the time of this posting), it’s been getting a lot of attention.
 
There are some very strong, compelling themes in this article. Computer science and engineering to have an “image problem”; the way we teach math to elementary school students is horrible and turns way too many away.
 
I don’t want to nitpick the article, but there are a few statements that reinforce the very damaging stereotypes that the article sets out to dispel.
  

“When women take on the challenges of an engineering or computer science education in college, some studies suggest that they struggle against a distinct set of personal, psycho-social issues… Even women who soldier</p><p>6 0.23785461 <a title="9-lda-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-07-05-Speaking%3A_Spend_at_least_1-3_of_the_time_practicing_the_talk.html">105 hilary mason data-2013-07-05-Speaking: Spend at least 1-3 of the time practicing the talk</a></p>

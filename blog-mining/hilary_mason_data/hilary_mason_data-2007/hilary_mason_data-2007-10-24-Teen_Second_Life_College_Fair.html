I was immensely privileged to participate in the first ever Teen Second Life College Fair. The event was on the  Eye4You Alliance  TSL island.  At least 18 institutions were represented (see some of the booths in the image to the left), and approximately 200 teens attended.
 
I gave a short presentation on my own educational experiences and the incredible possibilities for careers in technology, but my favorite part of the college fair was the casual conversations that took place outside of the sessions and in the booth area. We talked about everything from education in Europe vs the US to tagging to SL building and scripting to politics… you get the idea!

I just returned from the Second Life Community Convention in Chicago. I really appreciate all of the wonderful people that I had the chance to meet (or smeet) or just spend time with. There wasn’t nearly enough time for all of the conversations that I wanted to have!
 
There were a wide variety of presentations. We’ve come a long way since last year! The diversity of disciplines was astounding. I think the strongest work presented was in the sciences and medicine, and I was particularly impressed with the  Second Health  machinima.
 
Here are the slides from my presentation on Experiential Learning:

Hello, and welcome to everyone who found this site via Torley’s story on the  Second Life blog !
 
I lead the  Immersive Media Lab  at  J&W; University . Several of our projects have utilized Second Life, including  Virtual Morocco  (cultural exchange and tourism promotion for the country of Morocco) and  SLMetrics  (a study of behavior modeling in virtual environments).
 
This isn’t a Second Life blog, but you will find LSL scripts and other related ephemera around.

<p>Introduction: What’s wrong with this hat?    Posted:  January 22, 2008 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   education ,  second life ,  virtual worlds  |    8  Comments »    
   
 
The vendor containing this hat was recently deleted from Virtual Morocco by an employee of Linden Lab without any notification to me. Why? Because an anonymous person complained that it is “broadly offensive”.
 
 Virtual Morocco  was created to be both a tourism promotion platform and a space for cultural exchange. It was built entirely by undergraduate students as an educational service-learning project.
 
We give space in the Marrakesh Marketplace to several Moroccan artisans with virtual goods for sale. Our only requirements are that they keep everything appropriate to the sim’s theme and to the educational context of the space. The vendor selling the hat was owned by a college student (not from our institution) who specializes in items appropriate for the Morocco of the 1940s.

I was immensely privileged to participate in the first ever Teen Second Life College Fair. The event was on the  Eye4You Alliance  TSL island.  At least 18 institutions were represented (see some of the booths in the image to the left), and approximately 200 teens attended.
 
I gave a short presentation on my own educational experiences and the incredible possibilities for careers in technology, but my favorite part of the college fair was the casual conversations that took place outside of the sessions and in the booth area. We talked about everything from education in Europe vs the US to tagging to SL building and scripting to politics… you get the idea!
 
For educators and recruiters, this was a fantastic event for connecting with young people who are excited, passionate, and resourceful. The students were able to t</p><p>2 0.8823787 <a title="12-lda-2" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-08-12-DataGotham_2013_is_coming%21.html">106 hilary mason data-2013-08-12-DataGotham 2013 is coming!</a></p>

Registration is open for  DataGotham 2013 , our second annual New York data community conference, September 12th and 13th. The core of the conference is a series of brilliant data practitioners telling the stories about what they work on. The content is technically-oriented but not all deeply technical, and we really welcome anyone curious about how New York companies and institutions are pushing the boundaries on data to attend.
 
We have two goals for the conference. The primary goal is to connect people in the greater New York data community who are working on interesting things. If our community is strong and supportive, we will all do better work.
 
Our second goal is to highlight the amazing working happening here, so that people near and far will realize that New York is the best place in the world to do data science.</p><p>3 0.87585843 <a title="12-lda-3" href="../hilary_mason_data-2009/hilary_mason_data-2009-10-03-Hadoop_World_NYC.html">33 hilary mason data-2009-10-03-Hadoop World NYC</a></p>

Yesterday, I attended the first  Hadoop World NYC  conference.  Hadoop  is a platform for scalable distributed computing. In essence, it makes analyzing large quantities of data much faster, and analyzing very large quantities of data possible.
 
 Cloudera  did a great job organizing the conference, and managed to assemble a diverse set of speakers. The sessions covered everything from academic research to fraud detection to bioinformatics and even helping people fall in love (eHarmony uses Hadoop)!
 
I’m not going to review every session, but I saw several themes emerging from the content and conversations.

New integrated UIs like  Cloudera Desktop  and  Karmasphere  mean that developers will no longer be required to use a command-line interface to configure and execute Hadoop job</p><p>4 0.36746475 <a title="12-lda-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2010/hilary_mason_data-2010-08-15-Should_you_attend_Hadoop_World%3F_Yes..html">46 hilary mason data-2010-08-15-Should you attend Hadoop World?

<p>Introduction: Should you attend Hadoop World? Yes.    Posted:  August 15, 2010 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   conferences ,  hadoop ,  hadoopworld ,  questions  |    2  Comments »    
I received this e-mail via my  contact form :
  

I just discovered you via a Google search because I’m highly considering attending this year’s upcoming Hadoop World in NYC. I appreciate your page that you wrote up after attending last year’s event. I’m wondering if you feel that Hadoop has enough momentum and support to be a “here to stay” technology worth investing one’s time and education into, or is it possible it might fade and be deprecated by something else as the need for big data analysis continues to grow? …

  
I’ve had a few similar conversation with people lately, and I thought posting my response might help others making similar decisions. The e-mail is referencing my post from  last year’s hadoop world NYC .
  

Thanks for reaching out.

It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.
 
The tweet itself:
  
Love tech discussion but looking for a better community? Help me beta test a side project!  https://t.co/H3DYjbCy19

I created it pretty easily:
  
 First, go to  ads.twitter.com , log in, and go to “creatives”, then “cards”. 
 Click “Create Lead Generation Card”. It’s a big blue button.

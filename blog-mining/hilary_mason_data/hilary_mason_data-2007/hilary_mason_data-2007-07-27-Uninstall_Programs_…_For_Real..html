I don’t usually write about software, but this is an issue of general interest. When you uninstall a program, it often leaves behind little bits of itself. This cruft accumulates over time and, especially in Windows, can reduce the performance of your machine.
 
I recently stumbled on a pair of utilities that quickly and easily remove this cruft:  AppDelete  for OS X and  Revo Uninstaller  for Windows (XP and Vista).
 
   
 
AppDelete is exactly what you see in this screenshot. You drag a program’s icon onto the little wooden garbage pail from the Applications folder. It asks if you’re certain that you want to delete the program, and then removes it. I’ve been using it for several weeks, and it works great.

Welcome! I’ve gotten several hundred e-mails about my e-mail management code. I do want to share it as soon as possible. Here are the answers to the most common questions.
  Why separate scripts?  
My philosophy is based on the unix command-line tool model; Each script should be simple and useful alone, but when combined together they become extremely powerful.
  Why don’t we have the code yet?!  
I had no idea the talk would be shared beyond the couple hundred people in the audience or that it would be so popular! I started my position at  bit.ly  the same day I gave that IgniteNYC presentation, and I also have some  other   awesome   projects  that are competing for time.
 
I have to admit that the trained classifiers are all based on my personal data and were also trained mostly through tweaking in ipython.</p><p>4 0.053435709 <a title="6-tfidf-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2006/hilary_mason_data-2006-05-04-Intro_to_the_Linux_Command_Line.html">2 hilary mason data-2006-05-04-Intro to the Linux Command Line</a></p>

This document will step through the process of accessing a Linux server, and several basic commands.
  SSH  
We will access the server via the  SSH , or “Secure SHell”, protocol. SSH provides encrypted communication between two terminals. It is an alternative to telnet or rlogin.
 
First, make sure that you have an SSH client. If you are running Windows, I highly recommend  downloading Putty . Click on the top Windows binary and save it to the desktop. You can run Putty.exe directly, without installing.
 
If you are using OS X, open a terminal and run ‘ssh’.
  Logging In  
   
 
Type your hostname into the box. You can find your hostname by asking your ISP, but a good bet is that “www.yourdomain.com” will resolve to your server. You may need to request shell access

<p>Introduction: Speaking: Spend at least 1/3 of the time practicing the talk    Posted:  July 5, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   speaking   |    3  Comments »    
 This week we welcome a guest contribution.  Matthew Trentacoste  is a recovering academic and a computer scientist at Adobe, where he writes software to make pretty pictures. He’s constantly curious, often about data, and cooks a lot. You can follow his exploits at  @mattttrent . 
 
In Hilary’s last post, she made the point that  your slides != your talk .  In a well-crafted talk, your message — in the form of the words you say — needs to dominate while the slides need to play a supporting role.  Speak the important parts, and use your slides as a backdrop for what you’re saying.
 
Hilary has provided a valuable strategy in her post, but how should someone approach crafting such a clearly-organized presentation?  If you’re just getting started speaking, it can be a real challenge to make a coherent talk and along with slid</p><p>6 0.048744176 <a title="6-tfidf-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-05-02-How_to_get_a_random_line_from_a_file_in_bash..html">56 hilary mason data-2011-05-02-How to get a random line from a file in bash.</a></p>

My  research group  had some fun controlling SL with a Wii-mote a few weeks ago. It’s easier than you think! Several people have asked how we did it, so I hope these quick instructions might come in handy.
  
 Download, install, and run  DarwiinRemote . 
 Turn Bluetooth on on the Macbook. You can do this by opening the Bluetooth Preferences Pane (Apple menu, System Preferences and choose “Bluetooth” under Hardware) and clicking the big “Turn Bluetooth On” button. If Bluetooth is already on, you can skip this step! 
 Hold the Wii-mote in front of the Macbook and press buttons 1 and 2 simultaneously. The LEDs on the Wii-mote will flash. 
 As you move the Wii-mote, you’ll see your movement plotted on the screen, as you see below.

I’m at SXSW, and I want an ability to see the latest Tweets from the group of Twitterers that I follow who are here in the area. I also have a limited number of text messages on my phone (1500, but still).
 
I coded up a quick app that allows you to great a group of twitterers and see their latest tweet on a mobile-friend page.  Check it out .

<p>Introduction: Uninstall Programs … For Real.    Posted:  July 27, 2007 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   utilities  |    1  Comment »    
I don’t usually write about software, but this is an issue of general interest. When you uninstall a program, it often leaves behind little bits of itself. This cruft accumulates over time and, especially in Windows, can reduce the performance of your machine.
 
I recently stumbled on a pair of utilities that quickly and easily remove this cruft:  AppDelete  for OS X and  Revo Uninstaller  for Windows (XP and Vista).
 
   
 
AppDelete is exactly what you see in this screenshot. You drag a program’s icon onto the little wooden garbage pail from the Applications folder. It asks if you’re certain that you want to delete the program, and then removes it. I’ve been using it for several weeks, and it works great.
 
Revo Uninstaller is a bit more complicated, but it has many more features. When you load the program, it displays a list of all of you</p><p>2 0.97724724 <a title="6-lda-2" href="../hilary_mason_data-2012/hilary_mason_data-2012-01-26-Identity_Slippage%2C_and_what%E2%80%99s_the_weirdest_thing_you%E2%80%99ve_been_e-mailed_by_accident%3F.html">71 hilary mason data-2012-01-26-Identity Slippage, and what’s the weirdest thing you’ve been e-mailed by accident?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Identity Slippage, and what’s the weirdest thing you’ve been e-mailed by accident?    Posted:  January 26, 2012 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |    31  Comments »    
I have an old, short, and concise gmail address (my first initial and last name at gmail.com). There are many other hmasons in the world who have since signed up for gmail, with variations on the “hmason” theme. Every so often, they mistype the address, or someone mishears it. I now receive between four and ten pieces of e-mail per week  meant for other hmasons . This was pretty amusing until someone opened an amazon account on that address (which I had to shut down). Poor Holly has never seen a single Citibank credit card statement (and Citibank won’t remove the e-mail address from the account when I call, since I’m not the account holder). Heidi hasn’t linked her Paypal account to her bank account, but I’m waiting for someone to send her money.

Yesterday, I attended the first  Hadoop World NYC  conference.  Hadoop  is a platform for scalable distributed computing. In essence, it makes analyzing large quantities of data much faster, and analyzing very large quantities of data possible.
 
 Cloudera  did a great job organizing the conference, and managed to assemble a diverse set of speakers. The sessions covered everything from academic research to fraud detection to bioinformatics and even helping people fall in love (eHarmony uses Hadoop)!
 
I’m not going to review every session, but I saw several themes emerging from the content and conversations.
   Hadoop is Getting Easier   
New integrated UIs like  Cloudera Desktop  and  Karmasphere  mean that developers will no longer be required to use a command-line interface to configure and execute Hadoop job</p><p>4 0.16603775 <a title="6-lda-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2010/hilary_mason_data-2010-04-18-Stop_talking%2C_start_coding.html">42 hilary mason data-2010-04-18-Stop talking, start coding</a></p>

I read  Out of the Loop in Silicon Valley  in the NYTimes today, which explores how and why women are under-repesented in tech startups. From the number of retweets I saw and the clicks through  bit.ly  links (12,579 at the time of this posting), it’s been getting a lot of attention.
 
There are some very strong, compelling themes in this article. Computer science and engineering to have an “image problem”; the way we teach math to elementary school students is horrible and turns way too many away.
 
I don’t want to nitpick the article, but there are a few statements that reinforce the very damaging stereotypes that the article sets out to dispel.
  

“When women take on the challenges of an engineering or computer science education in college, some studies suggest that they struggle against a distinct set of personal, psycho-social issues… Even women who soldier</p><p>5 0.16114241 <a title="6-lda-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-12-18-Using_Twitter%E2%80%99s_Lead-Gen_Card_to_Recruit_Beta_Testers.html">114 hilary mason data-2013-12-18-Using Twitter’s Lead-Gen Card to Recruit Beta Testers</a></p>

It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.
 
The tweet itself:
  
Love tech discussion but looking for a better community? Help me beta test a side project!  https://t.co/H3DYjbCy19

I created it pretty easily:
  
 First, go to  ads.twitter.com , log in, and go to “creatives”, then “cards”. 
 Click “Create Lead Generation Card”. It’s a big blue button.

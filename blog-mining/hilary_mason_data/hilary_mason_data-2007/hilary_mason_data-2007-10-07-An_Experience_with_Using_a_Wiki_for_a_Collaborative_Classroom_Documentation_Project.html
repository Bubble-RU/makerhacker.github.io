I’m teaching a basic web design course this term that covers design concepts,  XHTML , and  CSS . The students are from a variety of backgrounds – some have knowledge of HTML, some are non-majors or non-credit students looking to pick up a useful skill, and many are complete beginners who are required to take the course as part of their degree programs.
 
Only a few students knew what a wiki (distinct from  Wikipedia ) was before beginning this project. The students were given a month to make their contributions to  the wiki . They were each assigned primary responsibility for one page at random, but were graded both on the success of their page and their contributions to other pages.

This summer, I’ve been involved in the process of creating a new undergraduate curriculum essentially from scratch. I was reflecting back on this process, and I realized the development of a robust and relevant curriculum shares many attributes with the process of developing robust and functional software.
 
Modern software development is a largely  modular  process. Each component of a system interacts with every other component through a defined interface. I see this same behavior in a degree program – each course has certain incoming requires and defined outcomes.

Educators  routinely discuss  how students have trouble evaluating and using the results of their Google searches. There are really two parts to this problem, though, and while it’s true that students may struggle to identify reliable sources, before we can address that, we need to teach them how to write good queries.
 
It’s that old computer science maxim:  Garbage In, Garbage Out .
 
I like to teach students how to write interesting queries by playing games. This games force students to think about the queries they are writing, and not the results. I have no scientific proof of the results, but I do know that it keeps them entertained and thinking for a while!

I’m really excited that  An Introduction to Machine Learning with Web Data  is now available for purchase!
 
This is a 2 hour and 43 minute instructional video that walks you through basic machine learning algorithms, first theoretically and mathematically, and then with Python example code (which is available  here ).
 
This video is an instructional take and builds on the material I covered in my  Strange Loop 2010  keynote  Machine Learning: A Love Story  and the  Data Bootcamp  I did with Joe Adler, Drew Conway, and Jake Hofman at  the  Strata Conference  in February.

I was talking to my web programming seminar about regular expressions and made an allusion to the  xkcd comic on that topic . Unfortunately, none of them had seen it, probably because none of them were familiar with xkcd.
 
Students should become familiar with the concepts and practice of the discipline, but also with the culture and in-jokes that will help them fit in when they get into industry or graduate school. I also like to get people to laugh in ways that are relevant to the subject material (yes, I use a lot of cheesy geek jokes — ask me to tell you my LISP joke sometime).
 
I asked the Twitter community what other geek cultural elements I should introduce the students to, and here are the answers:
  
 The comics:  xkcd ,  Penny Arcade

Dear friends and colleagues,
 
Do you do research that involves gathering data from human participants? This can be anything from marketing surveys to psychology experiments to medical science. If so, please take a short (5 to 10 minute) survey:
 
 research tool survey 
 
The results of the survey will help us design  a new platform for online human research !
 
I’m very excited about this project and would very much appreciate your input. If you have colleagues who do this kind of work, please pass it on.
 
Thank you!</p><p>6 0.22948906 <a title="11-lsi-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-09-26-Learn_to_Code%2C_Learn_to_Think.html">108 hilary mason data-2013-09-26-Learn to Code, Learn to Think</a></p>

My  research group  had some fun controlling SL with a Wii-mote a few weeks ago. It’s easier than you think! Several people have asked how we did it, so I hope these quick instructions might come in handy.
  
 Download, install, and run  DarwiinRemote . 
 Turn Bluetooth on on the Macbook. You can do this by opening the Bluetooth Preferences Pane (Apple menu, System Preferences and choose “Bluetooth” under Hardware) and clicking the big “Turn Bluetooth On” button. If Bluetooth is already on, you can skip this step! 
 Hold the Wii-mote in front of the Macbook and press buttons 1 and 2 simultaneously. The LEDs on the Wii-mote will flash. 
 As you move the Wii-mote, you’ll see your movement plotted on the screen, as you see below.

I’m teaching a basic web design course this term that covers design concepts,  XHTML , and  CSS . The students are from a variety of backgrounds – some have knowledge of HTML, some are non-majors or non-credit students looking to pick up a useful skill, and many are complete beginners who are required to take the course as part of their degree programs.
 
Only a few students knew what a wiki (distinct from  Wikipedia ) was before beginning this project. The students were given a month to make their contributions to  the wiki . They were each assigned primary responsibility for one page at random, but were graded both on the success of their page and their contributions to other pages.
 
43 students across two sections of the class participated in the project. Of those, five (or 11</p><p>4 0.91074663 <a title="11-lda-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2012/hilary_mason_data-2012-03-17-Short_URLs%2C_Big_Fun%3A_I_spoke_at_dropbox%21.html">72 hilary mason data-2012-03-17-Short URLs, Big Fun: I spoke at dropbox!</a></p>

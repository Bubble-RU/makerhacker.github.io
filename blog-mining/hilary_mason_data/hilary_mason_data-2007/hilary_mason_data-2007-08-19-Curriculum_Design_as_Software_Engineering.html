Modern software development is a largely  modular  process. Each component of a system interacts with every other component through a defined interface.

</p><p>6 Unit testing  is the practice of separating out each module in a software system and insuring that it functions correctly. [sent-7, score-0.674]
</p><p>7 The final system is will contain many modules interacting together in potentially unforeseen ways; by testing each piece repeatedly throughout the development process, we can reduce the number of problems that creep in when everything is integrated. [sent-8, score-0.599]
</p><p>8 If we continue the metaphor of courses as modules and curriculum as software system, we find that students will create an arrangement of these sets of courses, based on simple rules given in the course prerequisites and degree requirements. [sent-9, score-1.984]
</p><p>9 The arrangement must function to make certain that a student doesn’t end up in a course that they aren’t prepared for, while also making certain that any given legal arrangement of courses provides a degree program that meets the program outcomes. [sent-10, score-2.353]

</p><p>11 As odd as it may be to think of an educational program being “hacked”, we need to make certain that the rules are arranged such that any legal sequence of courses meets the degree program outcomes. [sent-14, score-1.533]
</p><p>12 It’s also important to make sure that a course taught by one faculty member has largely similar learning outcomes as the same course taught by another faculty member. [sent-15, score-1.299]
</p><p>13 Finally, software and curriculum share the odd trait of generally being created by people who are not the typical audience. [sent-16, score-0.846]
</p><p>14 Creating usable software generally involves gathering data from the community and directing development and testing accordingly; we see the same thing in educational programs. [sent-17, score-0.877]
</p><p>15 The community of “users” can be roughly divided into three major constituencies: University administration, students (and parents), and employers or graduate schools, each of which have different priorities and different priorities than the faculty or administrators creating the course. [sent-18, score-0.657]
</p><p>16 Thinking of curriculum design as software engineering is more than just a cute metaphor. [sent-20, score-0.928]
</p><p>17 We can take some of the well-understood tools and processes of software engineering and apply them in curriculum design. [sent-22, score-0.93]
</p><p>18 For example, unit testing teaches us to define both incoming requirements and outgoing interfaces for each module in a system. [sent-23, score-0.524]
</p><p>19 If we define both outcomes and “incomes” for all courses, we can create a map of all legal sequences involving that course and, by matching the various sets of outcomes to incomes, make certain that students will be best prepared to perform in the course at the time that they take it. [sent-24, score-1.514]
</p><p>20 By adapting the tools of software engineering to curriculum development, we can make the entire process easier and more likely to succeed, while providing more reliable objective data on the success of the degree program! [sent-25, score-1.387]

Data engineering is when  the architecture of your system is dependent on characteristics of the data flowing through that system .
 
It requires a different kind of engineering process than typical systems engineering, because you have to do some work upfront to understand the nature of the data before you can effectively begin to design the infrastructure. Most data engineering systems also transform the data as they process it.
 
Developing these types of systems requires an initial research phase, where you do the necessary work to understand the characteristics of the data,  before    you design the system (and perhaps even requiring an active experimental process where you try multiple infrastructure options in the wild before making a final decision).

I’m teaching a basic web design course this term that covers design concepts,  XHTML , and  CSS . The students are from a variety of backgrounds – some have knowledge of HTML, some are non-majors or non-credit students looking to pick up a useful skill, and many are complete beginners who are required to take the course as part of their degree programs.
 
Only a few students knew what a wiki (distinct from  Wikipedia ) was before beginning this project. The students were given a month to make their contributions to  the wiki . They were each assigned primary responsibility for one page at random, but were graded both on the success of their page and their contributions to other pages.

I don’t usually write about software, but this is an issue of general interest. When you uninstall a program, it often leaves behind little bits of itself. This cruft accumulates over time and, especially in Windows, can reduce the performance of your machine.
 
I recently stumbled on a pair of utilities that quickly and easily remove this cruft:  AppDelete  for OS X and  Revo Uninstaller  for Windows (XP and Vista).
 
   
 
AppDelete is exactly what you see in this screenshot. You drag a program’s icon onto the little wooden garbage pail from the Applications folder. It asks if you’re certain that you want to delete the program, and then removes it. I’ve been using it for several weeks, and it works great.

I read  Out of the Loop in Silicon Valley  in the NYTimes today, which explores how and why women are under-repesented in tech startups. From the number of retweets I saw and the clicks through  bit.ly  links (12,579 at the time of this posting), it’s been getting a lot of attention.
 
There are some very strong, compelling themes in this article. Computer science and engineering to have an “image problem”; the way we teach math to elementary school students is horrible and turns way too many away.
 
I don’t want to nitpick the article, but there are a few statements that reinforce the very damaging stereotypes that the article sets out to dispel.

I don’t want to nitpick the article, but there are a few statements that reinforce the very damaging stereotypes that the article sets out to dispel.

I just returned from the Second Life Community Convention in Chicago. I really appreciate all of the wonderful people that I had the chance to meet (or smeet) or just spend time with. There wasn’t nearly enough time for all of the conversations that I wanted to have!
 
There were a wide variety of presentations. We’ve come a long way since last year! The diversity of disciplines was astounding. I think the strongest work presented was in the sciences and medicine, and I was particularly impressed with the  Second Health  machinima.
 
Here are the slides from my presentation on Experiential Learning:
 
    
 
I’m hoping it inspires people to think about how we now have this capacity to create learning experiences that were simply never possible before. What do we do with it? How do we measure it?</p><p>same-blog 2 0.9471879 <a title="8-lda-2" href="../hilary_mason_data-2007/hilary_mason_data-2007-08-19-Curriculum_Design_as_Software_Engineering.html">8 hilary mason data-2007-08-19-Curriculum Design as Software Engineering</a></p>

This summer, I’ve been involved in the process of creating a new undergraduate curriculum essentially from scratch. I was reflecting back on this process, and I realized the development of a robust and relevant curriculum shares many attributes with the process of developing robust and functional software.
 
Modern software development is a largely  modular  process. Each component of a system interacts with every other component through a defined interface. I see this same behavior in a degree program – each course has certain incoming requires and defined outcomes. Students navigate through a narrative of courses that must fit together to equal a bachelor’s degree. 
 
 Unit testing  is the practice of separating out each module in a software system and insuring that it functions correctly. The final system is will contain many</p><p>3 0.25655299 <a title="8-lda-3" href="../hilary_mason_data-2007/hilary_mason_data-2007-10-24-Teen_Second_Life_College_Fair.html">12 hilary mason data-2007-10-24-Teen Second Life College Fair</a></p>

I was immensely privileged to participate in the first ever Teen Second Life College Fair. The event was on the  Eye4You Alliance  TSL island.  At least 18 institutions were represented (see some of the booths in the image to the left), and approximately 200 teens attended.
 
I gave a short presentation on my own educational experiences and the incredible possibilities for careers in technology, but my favorite part of the college fair was the casual conversations that took place outside of the sessions and in the booth area. We talked about everything from education in Europe vs the US to tagging to SL building and scripting to politics… you get the idea!
 
For educators and recruiters, this was a fantastic event for connecting with young people who are excited, passionate, and resourceful.

<p>Introduction: Should you attend Hadoop World? Yes.    Posted:  August 15, 2010 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   conferences ,  hadoop ,  hadoopworld ,  questions  |    2  Comments »    
I received this e-mail via my  contact form :
  

I just discovered you via a Google search because I’m highly considering attending this year’s upcoming Hadoop World in NYC. I appreciate your page that you wrote up after attending last year’s event. I’m wondering if you feel that Hadoop has enough momentum and support to be a “here to stay” technology worth investing one’s time and education into, or is it possible it might fade and be deprecated by something else as the need for big data analysis continues to grow? …

  
I’ve had a few similar conversation with people lately, and I thought posting my response might help others making similar decisions. The e-mail is referencing my post from  last year’s hadoop world NYC .

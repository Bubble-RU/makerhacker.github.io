Registration is open for  DataGotham 2013 , our second annual New York data community conference, September 12th and 13th. The core of the conference is a series of brilliant data practitioners telling the stories about what they work on. The content is technically-oriented but not all deeply technical, and we really welcome anyone curious about how New York companies and institutions are pushing the boundaries on data to attend.
 
We have two goals for the conference. The primary goal is to connect people in the greater New York data community who are working on interesting things. If our community is strong and supportive, we will all do better work.
 
Our second goal is to highlight the amazing working happening here, so that people near and far will realize that New York is the best place in the world to do data science.</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 Posted:  August 12, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   datagotham ,  nyc  |   Leave a comment »     Registration is open for  DataGotham 2013 , our second annual New York data community conference, September 12th and 13th.

I’m extremely excited about  DataGotham , a conference that I’m co-hosting with friends and fellow New York data nerds  Drew ,  John , and  Mike .
 
DataGotham is a celebration of the NYC data community, and will bring together professionals from all industries in New York that are built around data, from finance to fashion and from startups to the Fortune 500 and government. The event is September 13th – 14th at NYU, with tutorials and The Great Data Extravaganza Show (with cocktails!) at the Tribeca Rooftop Thursday evening, and a single track conference Friday. Our  speakers  and  sponsors  are all amazing. You can  register now .

 New York is infinite. 
 
A human can only explore a place at a particular speed. The rate of change in New York exceeds the rate at which a person can possibly experience the city, and so it is impossible to run out of city to experience.
 
 New York is a neighborhood. 
 
At the same time, New York is a mosaic of wonderful little neighborhoods. What many visitors miss and all residents know is that you rarely have to walk more than a few blocks from home for any of life’s essentials, and enough people do the same that you find yourself saying hello.
 
 New York is chaotic. 
 
You are never the weirdest thing you see. The city will give you things to think about, and more. It is never boring, and you cannot take it for granted.
 
 New York is opportunity. 
 
Everyone comes through New York, eventually.

The  Call for Proposals  is now open, and  we want you to speak . Our speakers come from every industry and type of background where people use data, and the best talks are ones where you tell us your real experience with a data project. What problem were you trying to solve? What went wrong? What went right? How does the story end? Or did it?
 
If you think you might have a story to tell but aren’t sure,  drop me a note . I’m happy to help you frame a successful talk, and we welcome speakers at all levels of experience.

I was immensely privileged to participate in the first ever Teen Second Life College Fair. The event was on the  Eye4You Alliance  TSL island.  At least 18 institutions were represented (see some of the booths in the image to the left), and approximately 200 teens attended.
 
I gave a short presentation on my own educational experiences and the incredible possibilities for careers in technology, but my favorite part of the college fair was the casual conversations that took place outside of the sessions and in the booth area. We talked about everything from education in Europe vs the US to tagging to SL building and scripting to politics… you get the idea!
 
For educators and recruiters, this was a fantastic event for connecting with young people who are excited, passionate, and resourceful.

Registration is open for  DataGotham 2013 , our second annual New York data community conference, September 12th and 13th. The core of the conference is a series of brilliant data practitioners telling the stories about what they work on. The content is technically-oriented but not all deeply technical, and we really welcome anyone curious about how New York companies and institutions are pushing the boundaries on data to attend.
 
We have two goals for the conference. The primary goal is to connect people in the greater New York data community who are working on interesting things. If our community is strong and supportive, we will all do better work.
 
Our second goal is to highlight the amazing working happening here, so that people near and far will realize that New York is the best place in the world to do data science.</p><p>3 0.87752414 <a title="106-lda-3" href="../hilary_mason_data-2009/hilary_mason_data-2009-10-03-Hadoop_World_NYC.html">33 hilary mason data-2009-10-03-Hadoop World NYC</a></p>

Yesterday, I attended the first  Hadoop World NYC  conference.  Hadoop  is a platform for scalable distributed computing. In essence, it makes analyzing large quantities of data much faster, and analyzing very large quantities of data possible.
 
 Cloudera  did a great job organizing the conference, and managed to assemble a diverse set of speakers. The sessions covered everything from academic research to fraud detection to bioinformatics and even helping people fall in love (eHarmony uses Hadoop)!
 
I’m not going to review every session, but I saw several themes emerging from the content and conversations.

New integrated UIs like  Cloudera Desktop  and  Karmasphere  mean that developers will no longer be required to use a command-line interface to configure and execute Hadoop job</p><p>4 0.33151928 <a title="106-lda-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2010/hilary_mason_data-2010-08-15-Should_you_attend_Hadoop_World%3F_Yes..html">46 hilary mason data-2010-08-15-Should you attend Hadoop World?

<p>Introduction: Should you attend Hadoop World? Yes.    Posted:  August 15, 2010 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   conferences ,  hadoop ,  hadoopworld ,  questions  |    2  Comments »    
I received this e-mail via my  contact form :
  

I just discovered you via a Google search because I’m highly considering attending this year’s upcoming Hadoop World in NYC. I appreciate your page that you wrote up after attending last year’s event. I’m wondering if you feel that Hadoop has enough momentum and support to be a “here to stay” technology worth investing one’s time and education into, or is it possible it might fade and be deprecated by something else as the need for big data analysis continues to grow? …

  
I’ve had a few similar conversation with people lately, and I thought posting my response might help others making similar decisions. The e-mail is referencing my post from  last year’s hadoop world NYC .
  

Thanks for reaching out.

<p>Introduction: Startups: Why to Share Data with Academics    Posted:  January 28, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |    5  Comments »    
Last week I wrote a bit about  how to share data with academics . This is the complimentary piece, on  why  you should invest the time and energy in sharing your data with the academic community.
 
As I was talking to people about this topic it became clear that there are really two different questions people ask. First, why do this at all? And second, what do I tell my boss?
 
Let’s start with the second one. This is what you should tell your boss:
  
  Academic research based on our work is a great press opportunity and demonstrates that credible people outside of our company find our work interesting.  
 Having researchers work on our data is an easy way to access highly educated brainpower, for free, that in no way competes with us. Who knows what interesting stuff they’ll come up with?

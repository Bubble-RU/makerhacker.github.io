It’s tempting to think of a talk as the opportunity to take a body of knowledge and to educate your audience about that body of knowledge. You have something in your head and you want to get it into theirs.
 
Making education your top priority leads to terrible talks, with an unhappy audience that won’t retain any of the information you wanted them to remember, anyway. Instead, think about how you can create a compelling narrative through your material, layering in the deep technical content so that the most attentive listeners will take away a deep understanding while the people who are only half paying attention will, at the very least, enjoy the experience.
 
I can’t think of any talk that demonstrates this better than Gary Bernhardt’s WAT:

Your title slide should focus on the title of the talk. It should also include your name and affiliation, your logo if you have a cute one, possibly your blog or e-mail address if you want people to get in touch, and your twitter handle.
 
Here’s one of mine:
 
   
 
I usually mention that the beginning of the talk that if people have questions they can tweet them at me. This isn’t just because Twitter is a great way to get questions from people too shy to speak up (or who don’t get an opportunity). Here’s the hack: letting people know that you’ll be reading everything they say about your talk on Twitter makes them more likely to say nice things.

If you took a college freshman literature class, you probably remember a diagram like this:
 
   
 
…with the x-axis reprenting time, and the y-axis (which, for some infuriating reason, is never labeled) representing intensity.
 
Last week’s speaking hack was to  limit yourself to 15 minutes (or less!) per idea . The hack this week is to use this gradient of intensity within each segment you present.
 
If you wrote it out as a linear outline, each idea in your talk might have:
  
 an introduction to the idea 
 a high-level overview of the idea 
 the technical details 
 an example that brings the technical details together (this is the most exciting part!) 
 a conclusion that wraps up why this is exciting, how it works, and what people learned

It’s a challenge to present deeply technical material to a room of people with varying expertise levels. If you leave it out, you’re abandoning the substance of your presentation. If you focus on it exclusively, you will lose most of the room.
 
Instead, include the material, but plan to repeat it two (or even three!) times.
 
The first time you explain it, explain it for the expert audience.
 
The second time you explain it, walk through an example of what the system enables.
 
If you’re audience is on Twitter, throw in a third version — the concise and tweetable one!

Let’s just admit it: very few people can pay attention to anything for more than fifteen minutes straight. Take advantage of this by never spending more than fifteen minutes on one idea during a talk.
 
That means that if your talk is 45 minutes long, you should break it down into at least three, perhaps four different ideas that you want to explore. I find it helpful to outline my talks this way on paper before I start putting slides together.
 
The ideas that you choose to explore within a talk should flow naturally together; there shouldn’t be a jarring transition. And if you find yourself belaboring the same point for more than fifteen minutes, try to break it down further.

You should be speaking at conferences.
 
Not an extrovert? Great. Speaking is for introverts!
 
We go to conferences to meet people (and learn things from people and find opportunities… from people). Meeting people at events takes a lot of energy, especially if you don’t look like the average dude at a conference. You have to explain your story to every single person you talk to, listen to theirs, and try to see if you have overlapping interests. It’s inefficient and takes a lot of time.
 
By being a speaker, you can tell your story just once, to everyone, and the people who are excited about what you have to say will come find you. You will actually save energy if you get up on stage.
 
It’s a great hack.

It’s tempting to think of a talk as the opportunity to take a body of knowledge and to educate your audience about that body of knowledge. You have something in your head and you want to get it into theirs.
 
Making education your top priority leads to terrible talks, with an unhappy audience that won’t retain any of the information you wanted them to remember, anyway. Instead, think about how you can create a compelling narrative through your material, layering in the deep technical content so that the most attentive listeners will take away a deep understanding while the people who are only half paying attention will, at the very least, enjoy the experience.
 
I can’t think of any talk that demonstrates this better than Gary Bernhardt’s WAT:

<p>Introduction: Why do I miss google calendar invites?    Posted:  January 2, 2012 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   calendar ,  configuration ,  google  |    2  Comments »    
I keep missing Google calendar invites on both my personal and work accounts. I’ve had my google account for years (since 2004?) and assumed it was some quirk of how I had configured something along the way.
 
Today I was following Google’s  instructions for syncing calendars with an iOS device  and discovered that if you click calendar settings (which means click the gear icon then ‘calendar settings’), then ‘calendar’, then ‘notifications’ next to the calendar that you care about, you can turn on e-mail and SMS notifications for any given calendar.
 
(I’ll save my ranting about the number of clicks to find and configuration anything on google’s properties right now for another time.)
 
I’m sharing this on the theory that I’m not the only one with this particular frustration.

Your title slide should focus on the title of the talk. It should also include your name and affiliation, your logo if you have a cute one, possibly your blog or e-mail address if you want people to get in touch, and your twitter handle.
 
Here’s one of mine:
 
   
 
I usually mention that the beginning of the talk that if people have questions they can tweet them at me. This isn’t just because Twitter is a great way to get questions from people too shy to speak up (or who don’t get an opportunity). Here’s the hack: letting people know that you’ll be reading everything they say about your talk on Twitter makes them more likely to say nice things.
 
Further, in a multi-track conference, people who weren’t actually in your talk (or were there but not paying a lot of attention) will judge your</p><p>6 0.47427547 <a title="95-lda-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-08-21-What_do_you_read_that_changes_the_way_you_think%3F.html">60 hilary mason data-2011-08-21-What do you read that changes the way you think?</a></p>

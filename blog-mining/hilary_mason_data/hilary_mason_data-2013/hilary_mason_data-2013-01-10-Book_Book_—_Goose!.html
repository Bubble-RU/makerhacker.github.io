I like to read. I love bookstores, I like to wander, and to find things that I didn’t know existed. But bookstores don’t have every book that exists. Amazon has most books, but search is a terrible way to discover new things. Amazon’s recommendations most likely maximize purchases, but are a terrible way to find something you didn’t know you were looking for (look at a book like  Effective JavaScript , for example, and you get recommendations for  Async JavaScript ,  Building Node Applications with MongoDB and Backbone ,  JavaScript Enlightenment ). Similarly, top 100 lists are great at showing you popular things that you’re probably more likely to buy, but not very good at helping you find a book with a story or idea that’s unlike anything you’ve read lately.
 
There must be a better way to explore books.

<p>Introduction: Books Recommendations for Programming Excellence    Posted:  November 1, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |    15  Comments »    
Yesterday I asked people on twitter for recommendations for things to read to improve as a programmer. I’m looking mainly for things on the philosophy side of software engineering. I do realize that practice is the most important thing, but sometimes you run into a design question and it’s always helpful to realize that very smart people have, indeed, thought about these things before.
 
I assembled the book recommendations into a  bitly bundle . I’ve only read a few of these (generally the older books) and so I can’t recommend specifics, but if you’d care to take a look  here they are !
 
If you see something that you think should be included, please do let me know in the comments and I’ll add it to the list.</p><p>3 0.17957638 <a title="83-tfidf-3" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-02-18-One_Random_Tweet%2C_please..html">90 hilary mason data-2013-02-18-One Random Tweet, please.</a></p>

It’s easy to believe that other people use social networks in the same way that you do. Your friends largely  do  use them the same way, which gives us an even more biased perspective.

 
Unfortunately, most networks don’t provide a way to explore representative communications that you’re not connected to.
 
Well, now you can!  One random tweet , please.
 
 Update:  There were some slight technical difficulties due to hitting Twitter’s oembed rate limit. They should be repaired now.

A friend asked me which of three startup business books she should read.  Obama’s reading list since entering office  has nothing surprising on it.
 
The most valuable books I read this year have been stories of things very different from what I spend most of my time thinking about.
 
One of my favorites was China Meiville’s  The City & The City , which I loved for the ambition and artistry, and another was Simon Winchester’s  The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary , which I loved for the descriptions of creating an analog, scalable information system.
 
What have you read recently that was really great?

<p>Introduction: How to get a random line from a file in bash.    Posted:  May 2, 2011 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   bash ,  code ,  one-liner ,  remember ,  tips  |    25  Comments »    
I work with a lot of data, and while I’d like to pretend it’s all in upside-down quasi-indexed b-tree rocket ships or some other advanced database, the truth is that much of it is in text files. I often find myself wanting to see a random line from one of these files, just to get a sense of what the data looks like.
 
I thought there must be an easy  bash  way to do this, but I couldn’t find it (‘shuf’ isn’t installed on my server), so I turned to twitter, and now I’m pleased to present more methods for finding a random line than you ever expected!
  
sort -R | head -n 1
  
If you can use this, do so! If it isn’t available, consider one of the following commands:
 
 @andrewgilmartin  suggests using awk:

It’s a challenge to present deeply technical material to a room of people with varying expertise levels. If you leave it out, you’re abandoning the substance of your presentation. If you focus on it exclusively, you will lose most of the room.
 
Instead, include the material, but plan to repeat it two (or even three!) times.
 
The first time you explain it, explain it for the expert audience.
 
The second time you explain it, walk through an example of what the system enables.
 
If you’re audience is on Twitter, throw in a third version — the concise and tweetable one!
 
Let’s say we were giving a talk about a machine learning system to classify puppies.

I like to read. I love bookstores, I like to wander, and to find things that I didn’t know existed. But bookstores don’t have every book that exists. Amazon has most books, but search is a terrible way to discover new things. Amazon’s recommendations most likely maximize purchases, but are a terrible way to find something you didn’t know you were looking for (look at a book like  Effective JavaScript , for example, and you get recommendations for  Async JavaScript ,  Building Node Applications with MongoDB and Backbone ,  JavaScript Enlightenment ). Similarly, top 100 lists are great at showing you popular things that you’re probably more likely to buy, but not very good at helping you find a book with a story or idea that’s unlike anything you’ve read lately.
 
There must be a better way to explore books.

 This week we welcome a guest contribution.  Matthew Trentacoste  is a recovering academic and a computer scientist at Adobe, where he writes software to make pretty pictures. He’s constantly curious, often about data, and cooks a lot. You can follow his exploits at  @mattttrent . 
 
In Hilary’s last post, she made the point that  your slides != your talk .  In a well-crafted talk, your message — in the form of the words you say — needs to dominate while the slides need to play a supporting role.  Speak the important parts, and use your slides as a backdrop for what you’re saying.
 
Hilary has provided a valuable strategy in her post, but how should someone approach crafting such a clearly-organized presentation?  If you’re just getting started speaking, it can be a real challenge to make a coherent talk and along with slid</p><p>5 0.43419456 <a title="83-lda-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2009/hilary_mason_data-2009-10-16-Data%3A_first_and_last_names_from_the_US_Census.html">34 hilary mason data-2009-10-16-Data: first and last names from the US Census</a></p>

I’ve found myself in need of a name distribution for a few projects recently, so I thought I would post it here so I won’t have to go looking for it again.
 
The data is available from the US Census Bureau (from 1990 census)  here , and I have it here in a friendly MySQL *.sql format (it will create the tables and insert the data). There are three tables: male first names, female first names, and surnames.
 
I’ve noted several issues in the data that are likely the result of typos, so make sure to do your own validation if your application requires it.
 
The format is simple:
  
 the name 
 frequency (percentage of people in the sampled population with that name) 
 cumulative frequency (as you read down the list, the percentage of total population covered) 
 rank

In 2008,  cuil , a search engine startup, displayed  my bio alongside a photo  of deceased actress  Hilary Mason . In January 2013,  Bing confused us , this time putting  my photo next to her bio  (they fixed it after a suitable amount of mocking on Twitter).

Today I win the internet?
 
   
 
If you zoom in on the bio section, you can clearly see that it’s her bio with a photo of me (originally from  Crain’s New York 40 under Forty ). Further, if you go into her filmography, you continue to see my photo.

    Google Now  is an extension to Google’s Android search app that uses all of the data that Google has about you along with what it can guess about your current context to present the information it thinks you need when it thinks you need it.
 
It’ll tell you to leave a bit early to make your next calendar event because of heavy traffic, or that it’s a friend’s birthday, or that there’s a cool cafe nearby where you are.

Educators  routinely discuss  how students have trouble evaluating and using the results of their Google searches.

In 2008,  cuil , a search engine startup, displayed  my bio alongside a photo  of deceased actress  Hilary Mason . In January 2013,  Bing confused us , this time putting  my photo next to her bio  (they fixed it after a suitable amount of mocking on Twitter).
 
Today,  Google did the same thing . ( live search link )
 
Today I win the internet?
 
   
 
If you zoom in on the bio section, you can clearly see that it’s her bio with a photo of me (originally from  Crain’s New York 40 under Forty ). Further, if you go into her filmography, you continue to see my photo.
    
I’m most proud of my starring role in the amazing film  Robot Jox . (bottom right of the image below)
 
   
    
I know that entity disambiguation is a hard problem. I’ve worked on it, though never with the kind of resources that I imagine Google can bring to it.

It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.
 
The tweet itself:

I created it pretty easily:
  
 First, go to  ads.twitter.com , log in, and go to “creatives”, then “cards”. 
 Click “Create Lead Generation Card”. It’s a big blue button. 
 You can include a title and a short description. Curiously, you can also include a 600px by 150px image.

<p>Introduction: Startups: Why to Share Data with Academics    Posted:  January 28, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |    5  Comments »    
Last week I wrote a bit about  how to share data with academics . This is the complimentary piece, on  why  you should invest the time and energy in sharing your data with the academic community.
 
As I was talking to people about this topic it became clear that there are really two different questions people ask. First, why do this at all? And second, what do I tell my boss?
 
Let’s start with the second one. This is what you should tell your boss:
  
  Academic research based on our work is a great press opportunity and demonstrates that credible people outside of our company find our work interesting.  
 Having researchers work on our data is an easy way to access highly educated brainpower, for free, that in no way competes with us. Who knows what interesting stuff they’ll come up with?

<p>Introduction: Need actual random numbers? Meet the NIST randomness beacon.    Posted:  September 30, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   projects   |  Tags:   beacon ,  python ,  random ,  randomness ,  randomnumbers  |    5  Comments »    
I wrote a  python module  that wraps that  NIST Randomness Beacon , making it simple to get truly random numbers in python.
 
It’s easy to use:
  b = Beacon()
print b.last_record()
print b.previous_record()
#and so on  
There’s also a handy generator for getting a set of  n  random numbers.
 
(One of the best gifts I ever got was a copy of  1,000,000 Random Numbers , and I’ve been intrigued ever since.)
 
Please note that this the randomness beacon is not intended to be a source of cryptographic keys — indeed, it’s a public set of numbers, so I wouldn’t recommend doing anything that could be compromised by someone else having the access to the  exact same set of numbers . Rather, this is interesting precisely for the scientific opportunities that</p><p>5 0.18511897 <a title="101-lda-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-06-22-My_Head_is_Open_Source%21.html">58 hilary mason data-2011-06-22-My Head is Open Source!</a></p>

Last night I visited friends at  Makerbot , where artist-in-residence  Jonathan Monaghan  scanned my head with a high-resolution laser scanner.
 
   
 
The  model is available on   Thingiverse  and can be printed on your friendly neighborhood makerbot or other 3d printer.
 
There are lots of other awesome models of people and things to play with, including  Stephen Colbert’s head .
 
I look forward to the emergence of plastic clone head armies!

We just released a bunch of  social data analysis APIs  over at  bitly . I’m really excited about this, as it’s offering developers the power to use social data in a way that hasn’t been available before. There are three types of endpoints and each one is awesome for a different reason.
 
First, we share the analysis that we do at the link level. Every developer using data from the web has the same set of problems — what are the topics of those URLs? What are their keywords? Why should you rebuild this infrastructure when we’ve done it already? We’ve also added in a few bits of bitly magic — for example, you can use the  /v3/link/location  endpoint to see where in the world  people are consuming that information from .

I get quite a few e-mail messages from very smart people who are looking to get started in data science. Here’s what I usually tell them:
 
The best way to get started in data science is to DO data science!
 
First, data scientists do three fundamentally different things:  math ,  code  (and engineer systems), and  communicate . Figure out which one of these you’re weakest at, and do a project that enhances your capabilities. Then figure out which one of these you’re best at, and pick a project which shows off your abilities.
 
Second, get to know other data scientists! If you’re in New York, try the  DataGotham events  list to find some meetups, and make sure to stay for the beers. Look for groups, like  DataKind , that need data skills put to work for good.

The April edition of Communications of the ACM has an interesting article on recent advances in active learning by Graeme Stemp-Morlock.
 
In  passive learning  (a more traditional approach), you build a large training set of classified data by (often) manually assigning labels. This data is used as the basis of your analysis. 
 
In the real world, we find that generating these large sets of labeled data is often expensive and time consuming. With  active learning , you identify the most ambiguous data to label, resulting in a much higher payoff for each label defined (and fewer headaches for your labelers).
 
The article goes on to mention that active learning is being used in practice with excellent results (for example in music identification, text classification, and even bioinfo</p><p>6 0.073837884 <a title="89-tfidf-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2010/hilary_mason_data-2010-09-04-Twitter_Succeeds_Because_it_Fails.html">48 hilary mason data-2010-09-04-Twitter Succeeds Because it Fails</a></p>

How can twitter be so popular and successful if it’s down   all the time  ?
 
We base statements like this on the assumption that quality of a web application maps linearly to the application’s stability. This is obviously true for most sites most of the time, but things get interesting at the edge where rare, unpredictable failure actually enables more complex human interactions around the service.
 
Unlike e-mail, twitter etiquette doesn’t demand that you read or reply to every message from every person you follow (or who follows you). Combine that lightweight social touch with occasional technical issues and human communication patterns, and we start to see some interesting behavior.
 
 Twitter’s lack of reliability as a platform allows us to use the technical failings to mask our own social imperfections .

<p>Introduction: Experimenting With Physical Graphs    Posted:  February 4, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |    4  Comments »    
I ended up at  NYC Resistor  on Sunday, and decided to experiment with physical visualization of some data. I grabbed the clicks per second on keyphrases including my name (“hilary mason”) over the last six months, aggregated them by day, and made this graph:
 
   
    
This is easy enough to construct for any phrase using the  clickrate data  that we’re calculating at  bitly . I exported it from matplotlib in svg, added a label, and used the laser-cutter to create this out of plywood:
      laser-cut time series
     
…which will shortly be adorning my desk at work. This is very simple, but there’s a lot of fun to be had with the physical manifestation of patterns we see in large amount of ephemeral data.</p><p>2 0.83891445 <a title="89-lda-2" href="../hilary_mason_data-2008/hilary_mason_data-2008-01-22-Create_a_group_Twitter_account.html">13 hilary mason data-2008-01-22-Create a group Twitter account</a></p>

 Twitter  rocks. It’s useful for  all kinds of things , but especially for chronicling a live event as it happens, including the pre-event discussion and post-conference wrapup.
 
We’re very excited to be hosting  NewB Camp  here in Providence, RI on February 23rd. In preparation for the event,  Sara  created a  NewBCamp  Twitter account and I coded up this quick script to pull in all tweets related to the conference.
 
It examines all of your followers tweets for a particular phrase or tag, and then reposts those tweets containing the tag to its own timeline with the author’s name prepended. I’m running this as a cron job on my hosting account. You can see it in action  here .
 
This is a quick hack. It has a couple of issue that I’m aware of:

It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.
 
The tweet itself:
  
Love tech discussion but looking for a better community? Help me beta test a side project!  https://t.co/H3DYjbCy19

I created it pretty easily:
  
 First, go to  ads.twitter.com , log in, and go to “creatives”, then “cards”. 
 Click “Create Lead Generation Card”. It’s a big blue button.

<p>Introduction: Startups: Why to Share Data with Academics    Posted:  January 28, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |    5  Comments »    
Last week I wrote a bit about  how to share data with academics . This is the complimentary piece, on  why  you should invest the time and energy in sharing your data with the academic community.
 
As I was talking to people about this topic it became clear that there are really two different questions people ask. First, why do this at all? And second, what do I tell my boss?
 
Let’s start with the second one. This is what you should tell your boss:
  
  Academic research based on our work is a great press opportunity and demonstrates that credible people outside of our company find our work interesting.  
 Having researchers work on our data is an easy way to access highly educated brainpower, for free, that in no way competes with us. Who knows what interesting stuff they’ll come up with?

<p>Introduction: Need actual random numbers? Meet the NIST randomness beacon.    Posted:  September 30, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   projects   |  Tags:   beacon ,  python ,  random ,  randomness ,  randomnumbers  |    5  Comments »    
I wrote a  python module  that wraps that  NIST Randomness Beacon , making it simple to get truly random numbers in python.
 
It’s easy to use:
  b = Beacon()
print b.last_record()
print b.previous_record()
#and so on  
There’s also a handy generator for getting a set of  n  random numbers.
 
(One of the best gifts I ever got was a copy of  1,000,000 Random Numbers , and I’ve been intrigued ever since.)
 
Please note that this the randomness beacon is not intended to be a source of cryptographic keys — indeed, it’s a public set of numbers, so I wouldn’t recommend doing anything that could be compromised by someone else having the access to the  exact same set of numbers . Rather, this is interesting precisely for the scientific opportunities that</p><p>6 0.24852189 <a title="89-lda-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2010/hilary_mason_data-2010-02-16-Conference%3A_Search_and_Social_Media_2010.html">40 hilary mason data-2010-02-16-Conference: Search and Social Media 2010</a></p>

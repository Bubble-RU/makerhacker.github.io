Slides are the supporting structure for your talk,  not the main event . Speak the meaty and informative portion of the presentation out loud and use slides as a backdrop to set either the emotional tone or reinforce the message that you are trying to convey.
 
   
 
For example, I love using this image of  Obama in Berlin  as a backdrop when I talk about the growth of social data over the last several years. In this image  every single person has a device  and is generating their own data about their shared social experience. The content of the image supports what is otherwise a fairly abstract statement, and you can feel the excitement of the crowd, boosting the excitement that I want to share about the possibilities of social data.

Your title slide should focus on the title of the talk. It should also include your name and affiliation, your logo if you have a cute one, possibly your blog or e-mail address if you want people to get in touch, and your twitter handle.
 
Here’s one of mine:
 
   
 
I usually mention that the beginning of the talk that if people have questions they can tweet them at me. This isn’t just because Twitter is a great way to get questions from people too shy to speak up (or who don’t get an opportunity). Here’s the hack: letting people know that you’ll be reading everything they say about your talk on Twitter makes them more likely to say nice things.
 
Further, in a multi-track conference, people who weren’t actually in your talk (or were there but not paying a lot of attention) will judge your</p><p>4 0.21748471 <a title="105-tfidf-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-03-23-Speaking%3A_15_Minutes_Or_Less_Per_Idea.html">96 hilary mason data-2013-03-23-Speaking: 15 Minutes Or Less Per Idea</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Speaking: 15 Minutes Or Less Per Idea    Posted:  March 23, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   speaking   |    3  Comments »    
Let’s just admit it: very few people can pay attention to anything for more than fifteen minutes straight. Take advantage of this by never spending more than fifteen minutes on one idea during a talk.
 
That means that if your talk is 45 minutes long, you should break it down into at least three, perhaps four different ideas that you want to explore. I find it helpful to outline my talks this way on paper before I start putting slides together.
 
The ideas that you choose to explore within a talk should flow naturally together; there shouldn’t be a jarring transition. And if you find yourself belaboring the same point for more than fifteen minutes, try to break it down further.

You should be speaking at conferences.
 
Not an extrovert? Great. Speaking is for introverts!
 
We go to conferences to meet people (and learn things from people and find opportunities… from people). Meeting people at events takes a lot of energy, especially if you don’t look like the average dude at a conference. You have to explain your story to every single person you talk to, listen to theirs, and try to see if you have overlapping interests. It’s inefficient and takes a lot of time.
 
By being a speaker, you can tell your story just once, to everyone, and the people who are excited about what you have to say will come find you. You will actually save energy if you get up on stage.
 
It’s a great hack.

It’s tempting to think of a talk as the opportunity to take a body of knowledge and to educate your audience about that body of knowledge. You have something in your head and you want to get it into theirs.
 
Making education your top priority leads to terrible talks, with an unhappy audience that won’t retain any of the information you wanted them to remember, anyway. Instead, think about how you can create a compelling narrative through your material, layering in the deep technical content so that the most attentive listeners will take away a deep understanding while the people who are only half paying attention will, at the very least, enjoy the experience.

Use a ratio of  one cute cat photo per equation  in your talk.
 
This is a concise way of saying that a ratio of one part heavy, technical content to one part light-hearted explanation is ideal.
 
You may have to play with the ratio depending on the audience or the expectations, but people react best when they have the chance to learn something fundamentally hard and interesting while, at the same time, getting to smile.
 
And yes, DO use photos of cute things in your talks! The hack here is that people naturally smile when they look at  adorableness . If they are smiling in  your  talk they credit  you  for the positive feelings. It’s an easy way to boost people’s perceived enjoyment of your talk and to get your audience into the kind of mood where it’s easier to walk them through more complex, technical material.</p><p>6 0.4927218 <a title="105-lsi-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-03-08-Speaking%3A_Title_Slides_%2B_Twitter_%3D_You_Win.html">94 hilary mason data-2013-03-08-Speaking: Title Slides + Twitter = You Win</a></p>

I recently attended the  Third Annual Workshop on Search and Social Media , an academic workshop with very strong industry participation. The workshop was packed, and had some of the most informative and interesting panel discussions I’ve seen (not counting the one I spoke on!).
 
 Daniel Tunkelang  did a great job of writing up the specific presentations on his site and  on the ACM blog , so I won’t attempt to re-create the presentations line by line at this late date. Rather, I’d like to highlight a few open problems and research questions that came out of the discussions that I hope to see developed in the next year.

 This week we welcome a guest contribution.  Matthew Trentacoste  is a recovering academic and a computer scientist at Adobe, where he writes software to make pretty pictures. He’s constantly curious, often about data, and cooks a lot. You can follow his exploits at  @mattttrent . 
 
In Hilary’s last post, she made the point that  your slides != your talk .  In a well-crafted talk, your message — in the form of the words you say — needs to dominate while the slides need to play a supporting role.  Speak the important parts, and use your slides as a backdrop for what you’re saying.
 
Hilary has provided a valuable strategy in her post, but how should someone approach crafting such a clearly-organized presentation?  If you’re just getting started speaking, it can be a real challenge to make a coherent talk and along with slid</p><p>3 0.4984847 <a title="105-lda-3" href="../hilary_mason_data-2009/hilary_mason_data-2009-10-16-Data%3A_first_and_last_names_from_the_US_Census.html">34 hilary mason data-2009-10-16-Data: first and last names from the US Census</a></p>

I’ve found myself in need of a name distribution for a few projects recently, so I thought I would post it here so I won’t have to go looking for it again.
 
The data is available from the US Census Bureau (from 1990 census)  here , and I have it here in a friendly MySQL *.sql format (it will create the tables and insert the data). There are three tables: male first names, female first names, and surnames.
 
I’ve noted several issues in the data that are likely the result of typos, so make sure to do your own validation if your application requires it.
 
The format is simple:
  
 the name 
 frequency (percentage of people in the sampled population with that name) 
 cumulative frequency (as you read down the list, the percentage of total population covered) 
 rank

<p>Introduction: One Random Tweet, please.    Posted:  February 18, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   projects   |    4  Comments »         One random tweet.
  
It’s easy to believe that other people use social networks in the same way that you do. Your friends largely  do  use them the same way, which gives us an even more biased perspective.

 
Unfortunately, most networks don’t provide a way to explore representative communications that you’re not connected to.
 
Well, now you can!  One random tweet , please.
 
 Update:  There were some slight technical difficulties due to hitting Twitter’s oembed rate limit. They should be repaired now.
  (Note: between this and  bookbookgoose.com  I’m on a bit of a random kick lately. There’s a method to this madness!)</p><p>5 0.48159245 <a title="105-lda-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-08-21-What_do_you_read_that_changes_the_way_you_think%3F.html">60 hilary mason data-2011-08-21-What do you read that changes the way you think?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What do you read that changes the way you think?    Posted:  August 21, 2011 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   books ,  philosophy ,  reading  |    24  Comments »    
A friend asked me which of three startup business books she should read.  Obama’s reading list since entering office  has nothing surprising on it.
 
The most valuable books I read this year have been stories of things very different from what I spend most of my time thinking about.
 
One of my favorites was China Meiville’s  The City & The City , which I loved for the ambition and artistry, and another was Simon Winchester’s  The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary , which I loved for the descriptions of creating an analog, scalable information system.
 
What have you read recently that was really great?

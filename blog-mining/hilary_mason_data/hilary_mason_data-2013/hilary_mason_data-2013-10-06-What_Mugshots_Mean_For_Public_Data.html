The New York Times has a story this morning  on the growing use of mugshot data for, essentially, extortion . These sites scrape mugshots off of public records databases, use SEO techniques to rank highly in Google searches for people’s names, and then charge those featured in the image to have the pages removed. Many of the people featured were never even convicted of a crime.
 
What the mugshot story demonstrates but never says explicitly is that data is no longer just private or public, but often exists in an in-between state, where the public-ness of the data is a function of how much work is required to find it.

You should be speaking at conferences.
 
Not an extrovert? Great. Speaking is for introverts!
 
We go to conferences to meet people (and learn things from people and find opportunities… from people). Meeting people at events takes a lot of energy, especially if you don’t look like the average dude at a conference. You have to explain your story to every single person you talk to, listen to theirs, and try to see if you have overlapping interests. It’s inefficient and takes a lot of time.
 
By being a speaker, you can tell your story just once, to everyone, and the people who are excited about what you have to say will come find you. You will actually save energy if you get up on stage.
 
It’s a great hack.

I recently attended the  Third Annual Workshop on Search and Social Media , an academic workshop with very strong industry participation. The workshop was packed, and had some of the most informative and interesting panel discussions I’ve seen (not counting the one I spoke on!).
 
 Daniel Tunkelang  did a great job of writing up the specific presentations on his site and  on the ACM blog , so I won’t attempt to re-create the presentations line by line at this late date. Rather, I’d like to highlight a few open problems and research questions that came out of the discussions that I hope to see developed in the next year.

This post assumes that you  want  to share data. If you’re not convinced, don’t worry — that’s next on my list.   
 
You and your academic colleagues will benefit from having at least a quick chat about the research questions they want to address. I’ve read every paper I’ve been able to find that uses bitly data and all of the ones that acquired the data without our assistance had serious flaws, generally based on incorrect assumptions about the data they had acquired (this, unfortunately, makes me question the validity of most research done on commercial social data without cooperation from the subject company).
 
The easiest way to share data is  through your own API . Set generous rate limits where possible. Most projects are not realtime and they can gather the data (or, more likely, have a grad</p><p>5 0.082485266 <a title="110-tfidf-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2012/hilary_mason_data-2012-12-28-Getting_Started_with_Data_Science.html">80 hilary mason data-2012-12-28-Getting Started with Data Science</a></p>

I get quite a few e-mail messages from very smart people who are looking to get started in data science. Here’s what I usually tell them:
 
The best way to get started in data science is to DO data science!
 
First, data scientists do three fundamentally different things:  math ,  code  (and engineer systems), and  communicate . Figure out which one of these you’re weakest at, and do a project that enhances your capabilities. Then figure out which one of these you’re best at, and pick a project which shows off your abilities.
 
Second, get to know other data scientists! If you’re in New York, try the  DataGotham events  list to find some meetups, and make sure to stay for the beers. Look for groups, like  DataKind , that need data skills put to work for good.

I just got home from the  Web 2.0 Summit , a three-day conference that was packed with announcements, interesting ideas, and good conversations.

On Friday, January 28th I hopped in a cab and went up to NPR’s Bryant Park recording studio for a fifteen minute chat with  Ira Flatow , host of  Science Friday . I’ve been a big fan of Ira and Science Friday since I discovered the show years ago, and it was a very exciting honor to be a guest.
 
   
 
The image at the right is a snapshot I took with my phone while nervously waiting outside the studio.
 
The title of the segment is the rather dramatic  Privacy At Stake As Sites Track Online Preferences . Our conversation wound around the issues of tracking user data online, and the potential opportunities and dangers that all users of online services face.
 
NPR has  the full broadcast and transcript online .

I think this might be my very first LSL script, from back in 2005! This script indicates whether your AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) account is online by changing the color of an object. You can configure it to either share your AIM ID publicly, or keep it private.
      AIM Indicators in Second LIfe
  
This script uses the AIM web services API to check your online status — you only need to give it your username, not your password! This is not a proxy service. You can’t send messages through this script, just show your online status in SL.
 
To use this script,  create an object in your favorite shape, create a new script inside of it, paste this code into it and save .

<p>Introduction: What Mugshots Mean For Public Data    Posted:  October 6, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   data ,  mugshots ,  privacy  |    20  Comments »    
   
 
The New York Times has a story this morning  on the growing use of mugshot data for, essentially, extortion . These sites scrape mugshots off of public records databases, use SEO techniques to rank highly in Google searches for people’s names, and then charge those featured in the image to have the pages removed. Many of the people featured were never even convicted of a crime.
 
What the mugshot story demonstrates but never says explicitly is that data is no longer just private or public, but often exists in an in-between state, where the public-ness of the data is a function of how much work is required to find it.
 
Let’s say you’re actually doing a background check on someone you are going on a date with (one of the use cases the operators of these sites claim is common).

<p>Introduction: Need actual random numbers? Meet the NIST randomness beacon.    Posted:  September 30, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   projects   |  Tags:   beacon ,  python ,  random ,  randomness ,  randomnumbers  |    5  Comments »    
I wrote a  python module  that wraps that  NIST Randomness Beacon , making it simple to get truly random numbers in python.
 
It’s easy to use:
  b = Beacon()
print b.last_record()
print b.previous_record()
#and so on  
There’s also a handy generator for getting a set of  n  random numbers.
 
(One of the best gifts I ever got was a copy of  1,000,000 Random Numbers , and I’ve been intrigued ever since.)
 
Please note that this the randomness beacon is not intended to be a source of cryptographic keys — indeed, it’s a public set of numbers, so I wouldn’t recommend doing anything that could be compromised by someone else having the access to the  exact same set of numbers . Rather, this is interesting precisely for the scientific opportunities that</p><p>3 0.24154764 <a title="110-lda-3" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-12-18-Using_Twitter%E2%80%99s_Lead-Gen_Card_to_Recruit_Beta_Testers.html">114 hilary mason data-2013-12-18-Using Twitter’s Lead-Gen Card to Recruit Beta Testers</a></p>

It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.
 
The tweet itself:

I created it pretty easily:
  
 First, go to  ads.twitter.com , log in, and go to “creatives”, then “cards”. 
 Click “Create Lead Generation Card”. It’s a big blue button.

I recently attended the  Third Annual Workshop on Search and Social Media , an academic workshop with very strong industry participation. The workshop was packed, and had some of the most informative and interesting panel discussions I’ve seen (not counting the one I spoke on!).
 
 Daniel Tunkelang  did a great job of writing up the specific presentations on his site and  on the ACM blog , so I won’t attempt to re-create the presentations line by line at this late date. Rather, I’d like to highlight a few open problems and research questions that came out of the discussions that I hope to see developed in the next year.

<p>Introduction: Startups: Why to Share Data with Academics    Posted:  January 28, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |    5  Comments »    
Last week I wrote a bit about  how to share data with academics . This is the complimentary piece, on  why  you should invest the time and energy in sharing your data with the academic community.
 
As I was talking to people about this topic it became clear that there are really two different questions people ask. First, why do this at all? And second, what do I tell my boss?
 
Let’s start with the second one. This is what you should tell your boss:
  
  Academic research based on our work is a great press opportunity and demonstrates that credible people outside of our company find our work interesting.  
 Having researchers work on our data is an easy way to access highly educated brainpower, for free, that in no way competes with us. Who knows what interesting stuff they’ll come up with?

Last week I wrote a bit about  how to share data with academics . This is the complimentary piece, on  why  you should invest the time and energy in sharing your data with the academic community.
 
As I was talking to people about this topic it became clear that there are really two different questions people ask. First, why do this at all? And second, what do I tell my boss?
 
Let’s start with the second one. This is what you should tell your boss:
  
  Academic research based on our work is a great press opportunity and demonstrates that credible people outside of our company find our work interesting.  
 Having researchers work on our data is an easy way to access highly educated brainpower, for free, that in no way competes with us. Who knows what interesting stuff they’ll come up with?

Data scientists need data, and good data is hard to find. I put together this bitly  bundle of research quality data sets  to collect as many useful data sets as possible in one place. The list includes such exciting and diverse things as spam, belly buttons, item pricing, social media, and face recognition, so you know there’s something that will intrigue anyone.
 
Have one to add? Let me know!

We just released a bunch of  social data analysis APIs  over at  bitly . I’m really excited about this, as it’s offering developers the power to use social data in a way that hasn’t been available before. There are three types of endpoints and each one is awesome for a different reason.
 
First, we share the analysis that we do at the link level. Every developer using data from the web has the same set of problems — what are the topics of those URLs? What are their keywords? Why should you rebuild this infrastructure when we’ve done it already? We’ve also added in a few bits of bitly magic — for example, you can use the  /v3/link/location  endpoint to see where in the world  people are consuming that information from .
 
Second, we’ve opened up access to a realtime search engine.

<p>Introduction: How do you prioritize research?    Posted:  August 28, 2012 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   datascience ,  startups  |    14  Comments »    
One of the most fun and challenging parts of my job is setting bitly’s research agenda. We’re a startup, so this means prioritizing the set of questions we look into in the context of what will be most beneficial for the rest of the business, for the short and long-term, by creating opportunity and opening up potential futures. We work on a wide variety of projects, from pure research to  press collaborations  to  infrastructure  and  experimental products .
 
We always have a list of research questions way longer than we have time and resources to pursue, so we developed a process for evaluating whether a given question is worth pursuing at a particular time.
 
This is the kind of process that I’ve only discussed with several people over whisky (thanks!), but not seen written up.

<p>Introduction: Data Engineering    Posted:  April 1, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   bitly ,  data ,  engineering ,  infrastructure  |    5  Comments »    
Data engineering is when  the architecture of your system is dependent on characteristics of the data flowing through that system .
 
It requires a different kind of engineering process than typical systems engineering, because you have to do some work upfront to understand the nature of the data before you can effectively begin to design the infrastructure. Most data engineering systems also transform the data as they process it.
 
Developing these types of systems requires an initial research phase, where you do the necessary work to understand the characteristics of the data,  before    you design the system (and perhaps even requiring an active experimental process where you try multiple infrastructure options in the wild before making a final decision).

Welcome! I’ve gotten several hundred e-mails about my e-mail management code. I do want to share it as soon as possible. Here are the answers to the most common questions.
  Why separate scripts?  
My philosophy is based on the unix command-line tool model; Each script should be simple and useful alone, but when combined together they become extremely powerful.
  Why don’t we have the code yet?!  
I had no idea the talk would be shared beyond the couple hundred people in the audience or that it would be so popular! I started my position at  bit.ly  the same day I gave that IgniteNYC presentation, and I also have some  other   awesome   projects  that are competing for time.
 
I have to admit that the trained classifiers are all based on my personal data and were also trained mostly through tweaking in ipython.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.88655061 <a title="85-lda-2" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-01-19-Startups%3A_How_to_Share_Data_with_Academics.html">85 hilary mason data-2013-01-19-Startups: How to Share Data with Academics</a></p>

This post assumes that you  want  to share data. If you’re not convinced, don’t worry — that’s next on my list.   
 
You and your academic colleagues will benefit from having at least a quick chat about the research questions they want to address. I’ve read every paper I’ve been able to find that uses bitly data and all of the ones that acquired the data without our assistance had serious flaws, generally based on incorrect assumptions about the data they had acquired (this, unfortunately, makes me question the validity of most research done on commercial social data without cooperation from the subject company).
 
The easiest way to share data is  through your own API . Set generous rate limits where possible. Most projects are not realtime and they can gather the data (or, more likely, have a grad</p><p>3 0.42273301 <a title="85-lda-3" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-12-18-Using_Twitter%E2%80%99s_Lead-Gen_Card_to_Recruit_Beta_Testers.html">114 hilary mason data-2013-12-18-Using Twitter’s Lead-Gen Card to Recruit Beta Testers</a></p>

It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.
 
The tweet itself:
  
Love tech discussion but looking for a better community? Help me beta test a side project!  https://t.co/H3DYjbCy19

I created it pretty easily:
  
 First, go to  ads.twitter.com , log in, and go to “creatives”, then “cards”. 
 Click “Create Lead Generation Card”. It’s a big blue button.

Last week I wrote a bit about  how to share data with academics . This is the complimentary piece, on  why  you should invest the time and energy in sharing your data with the academic community.
 
As I was talking to people about this topic it became clear that there are really two different questions people ask. First, why do this at all? And second, what do I tell my boss?
 
Let’s start with the second one. This is what you should tell your boss:
  
  Academic research based on our work is a great press opportunity and demonstrates that credible people outside of our company find our work interesting.  
 Having researchers work on our data is an easy way to access highly educated brainpower, for free, that in no way competes with us. Who knows what interesting stuff they’ll come up with?

<p>Introduction: Need actual random numbers? Meet the NIST randomness beacon.    Posted:  September 30, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   projects   |  Tags:   beacon ,  python ,  random ,  randomness ,  randomnumbers  |    5  Comments »    
I wrote a  python module  that wraps that  NIST Randomness Beacon , making it simple to get truly random numbers in python.
 
It’s easy to use:
  b = Beacon()
print b.last_record()
print b.previous_record()
#and so on  
There’s also a handy generator for getting a set of  n  random numbers.
 
(One of the best gifts I ever got was a copy of  1,000,000 Random Numbers , and I’ve been intrigued ever since.)
 
Please note that this the randomness beacon is not intended to be a source of cryptographic keys — indeed, it’s a public set of numbers, so I wouldn’t recommend doing anything that could be compromised by someone else having the access to the  exact same set of numbers . Rather, this is interesting precisely for the scientific opportunities that</p><p>6 0.39617419 <a title="85-lda-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-06-22-My_Head_is_Open_Source%21.html">58 hilary mason data-2011-06-22-My Head is Open Source!</a></p>

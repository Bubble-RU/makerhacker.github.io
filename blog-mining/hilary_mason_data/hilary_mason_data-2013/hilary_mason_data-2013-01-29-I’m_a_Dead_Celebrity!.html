I have an old, short, and concise gmail address (my first initial and last name at gmail.com). There are many other hmasons in the world who have since signed up for gmail, with variations on the “hmason” theme. Every so often, they mistype the address, or someone mishears it. I now receive between four and ten pieces of e-mail per week  meant for other hmasons . This was pretty amusing until someone opened an amazon account on that address (which I had to shut down). Poor Holly has never seen a single Citibank credit card statement (and Citibank won’t remove the e-mail address from the account when I call, since I’m not the account holder). Heidi hasn’t linked her Paypal account to her bank account, but I’m waiting for someone to send her money.

We’ve gotten very good at extracting and disambiguation entities from text data. You can license a  commodity system , and there are  API  and even  open source tools  that work fairly well.
 
However, a large percentage of content that people share is not primarily text (a back-of-the-envelope guess says around 18%), and we currently have very little automated insight into that content.
 
I know this is a very hard problem, but I’m continuously surprised by how few people seem to be working on it. Any ideas?</p><p>5 0.082356282 <a title="88-tfidf-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-03-23-Why_Google_Now_is_Awesome.html">97 hilary mason data-2013-03-23-Why Google Now is Awesome</a></p>

    Google Now  is an extension to Google’s Android search app that uses all of the data that Google has about you along with what it can guess about your current context to present the information it thinks you need when it thinks you need it.
 
It’ll tell you to leave a bit early to make your next calendar event because of heavy traffic, or that it’s a friend’s birthday, or that there’s a cool cafe nearby where you are.
 
I think it’s amazing.
 
It’s amazing because this is the first Google product that takes ALL OF THE DATA that they have about us and actually makes it useful  for us . Not for advertisers.

The wonderful folks at  LucidWorks  have posted the video of my recent  Lucene Revolution  keynote.
 
The brief idea behind this talk is that search is not a solved problem — there is still a big opportunity for building search (and finding?) capabilities for the kinds of questions that the current product fail to solve. For example, why do search engines just return a list of sorted URLs, but give me no information about the themes that are consistent across them?
 
The audience was technical, specifically Lucene and Solr devs, so I spent some time talking about how we use those technologies at bitly.</p><p>5 0.18373893 <a title="88-lsi-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2012/hilary_mason_data-2012-01-26-Identity_Slippage%2C_and_what%E2%80%99s_the_weirdest_thing_you%E2%80%99ve_been_e-mailed_by_accident%3F.html">71 hilary mason data-2012-01-26-Identity Slippage, and what’s the weirdest thing you’ve been e-mailed by accident?</a></p>

Poor Holly has never seen a single Citibank credit card statement (and Citibank won’t remove the e-mail address from the account when I call, since I’m not the account holder). Heidi hasn’t linked her Paypal account to her bank account, but I’m waiting for someone to send her money.

I have a Google alert set up for my name, and over the weekend it sent me  here .
 
 Update:  Bing has removed the page and now redirects to a regular search.
 
It’s a page on Bing Celebrities, merging my information with information about Hilary Mason,  the (now deceased) British actress . According to this page, I have starred in movies before I was born and made videos after I died. It’s my photo and her filmography.
 
It’s creepy, but it’s also intriguing. How does this happen?
 
The data is credited to AMG and  inbaseline , whose domain, though linked directly from Bing, does not resolve. Entity disambiguation is certainly a challenge, but I expect more from Microsoft, with so much data and so many brains.
 
This kind of error makes it extremely clear that  identity is not a solved problem .

I’ve always been skeptical of and fascinated by personality tests. On the one hand, it’s your personality — who could possibly know more about you than you do? On the other, there’s something alluring about quantifying your characteristics, especially when you can compare them to others.

I recently ended up with two posts on this site about the same project — one was a short summary, and the other a long, detailed article. I decided to consolidate them into the longer article, but I didn’t want to lose the six comments that had been posted to the short article.
 
I couldn’t find a way in the WordPress UI to move comments from one post to another, so I jumped into the database. If you run WordPress on a host, they probably provide a MySQL management tool like PHPMyAdmin, or you can log in with a mysql client.
 
First, find the table that contains the posts for your blog (the table name usually ends in  _posts ). Find the ID that matches the post you want to move comments  from , and the ID for the post that you want to move comments  to .
 
Note: An easy way to do this is to search by t</p><p>4 0.15732712 <a title="88-lda-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-07-05-Speaking%3A_Spend_at_least_1-3_of_the_time_practicing_the_talk.html">105 hilary mason data-2013-07-05-Speaking: Spend at least 1-3 of the time practicing the talk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Speaking: Spend at least 1/3 of the time practicing the talk    Posted:  July 5, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   speaking   |    3  Comments »    
 This week we welcome a guest contribution.  Matthew Trentacoste  is a recovering academic and a computer scientist at Adobe, where he writes software to make pretty pictures. He’s constantly curious, often about data, and cooks a lot. You can follow his exploits at  @mattttrent . 
 
In Hilary’s last post, she made the point that  your slides != your talk .  In a well-crafted talk, your message — in the form of the words you say — needs to dominate while the slides need to play a supporting role.  Speak the important parts, and use your slides as a backdrop for what you’re saying.
 
Hilary has provided a valuable strategy in her post, but how should someone approach crafting such a clearly-organized presentation?  If you’re just getting started speaking, it can be a real challenge to make a coherent talk and along with slid</p><p>5 0.15727714 <a title="88-lda-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-12-18-Using_Twitter%E2%80%99s_Lead-Gen_Card_to_Recruit_Beta_Testers.html">114 hilary mason data-2013-12-18-Using Twitter’s Lead-Gen Card to Recruit Beta Testers</a></p>

It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.
 
The tweet itself:
  
Love tech discussion but looking for a better community? Help me beta test a side project!  https://t.co/H3DYjbCy19

I created it pretty easily:
  
 First, go to  ads.twitter.com , log in, and go to “creatives”, then “cards”. 
 Click “Create Lead Generation Card”. It’s a big blue button.

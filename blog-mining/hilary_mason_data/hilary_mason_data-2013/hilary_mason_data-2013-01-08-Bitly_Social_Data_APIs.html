We just released a bunch of  social data analysis APIs  over at  bitly . I’m really excited about this, as it’s offering developers the power to use social data in a way that hasn’t been available before. There are three types of endpoints and each one is awesome for a different reason.
 
First, we share the analysis that we do at the link level. Every developer using data from the web has the same set of problems — what are the topics of those URLs? What are their keywords? Why should you rebuild this infrastructure when we’ve done it already? We’ve also added in a few bits of bitly magic — for example, you can use the  /v3/link/location  endpoint to see where in the world  people are consuming that information from .

</p><p>13 We have a system that tracks the rate of clicks – a proxy for attention – on phrases contained within the URLs being clicked through bitly. [sent-16, score-0.908]
</p><p>14 Then we can look and see which phrases are currently receiving a disproportionate amount of attention. [sent-17, score-0.417]

You and your academic colleagues will benefit from having at least a quick chat about the research questions they want to address.

I gave a talk called  A Data-driven Look at the Realtime Web Ecosystem  at the  Web2Expo SF  conference in May in San Francisco. I attempted to highlight some of the interesting facets of the bit.ly data set, and it appeared to be well-received (showing up on  TechCrunch ,  ZDNet , and a few other places).
 
I attended the full conference, and it was great. The attendees were extremely international and I met a ton of fascinating people.
 
I’m still getting a couple of e-mail requests per week for my slides and materials, so they’re posted below for posterity.

Data scientists need data, and good data is hard to find. I put together this bitly  bundle of research quality data sets  to collect as many useful data sets as possible in one place. The list includes such exciting and diverse things as spam, belly buttons, item pricing, social media, and face recognition, so you know there’s something that will intrigue anyone.

The wonderful folks at  LucidWorks  have posted the video of my recent  Lucene Revolution  keynote.
 
The brief idea behind this talk is that search is not a solved problem — there is still a big opportunity for building search (and finding?) capabilities for the kinds of questions that the current product fail to solve. For example, why do search engines just return a list of sorted URLs, but give me no information about the themes that are consistent across them?
 
The audience was technical, specifically Lucene and Solr devs, so I spent some time talking about how we use those technologies at bitly.</p><p>5 0.37468022 <a title="82-lsi-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-01-17-Need_Data%3F_Start_Here.html">84 hilary mason data-2013-01-17-Need Data?

We just released a bunch of  social data analysis APIs  over at  bitly . I’m really excited about this, as it’s offering developers the power to use social data in a way that hasn’t been available before. There are three types of endpoints and each one is awesome for a different reason.
 
First, we share the analysis that we do at the link level. Every developer using data from the web has the same set of problems — what are the topics of those URLs? What are their keywords? Why should you rebuild this infrastructure when we’ve done it already? We’ve also added in a few bits of bitly magic — for example, you can use the  /v3/link/location  endpoint to see where in the world  people are consuming that information from .
 
Second, we’ve opened up access to a realtime search engine.

It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.
 
The tweet itself:

I created it pretty easily:
  
 First, go to  ads.twitter.com , log in, and go to “creatives”, then “cards”. 
 Click “Create Lead Generation Card”. It’s a big blue button.

This post assumes that you  want  to share data. If you’re not convinced, don’t worry — that’s next on my list.   
 
You and your academic colleagues will benefit from having at least a quick chat about the research questions they want to address. I’ve read every paper I’ve been able to find that uses bitly data and all of the ones that acquired the data without our assistance had serious flaws, generally based on incorrect assumptions about the data they had acquired (this, unfortunately, makes me question the validity of most research done on commercial social data without cooperation from the subject company).
 
The easiest way to share data is  through your own API . Set generous rate limits where possible. Most projects are not realtime and they can gather the data (or, more likely, have a grad</p><p>4 0.32622501 <a title="82-lda-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-07-05-Speaking%3A_Spend_at_least_1-3_of_the_time_practicing_the_talk.html">105 hilary mason data-2013-07-05-Speaking: Spend at least 1-3 of the time practicing the talk</a></p>

 This week we welcome a guest contribution.  Matthew Trentacoste  is a recovering academic and a computer scientist at Adobe, where he writes software to make pretty pictures. He’s constantly curious, often about data, and cooks a lot. You can follow his exploits at  @mattttrent . 
 
In Hilary’s last post, she made the point that  your slides != your talk .  In a well-crafted talk, your message — in the form of the words you say — needs to dominate while the slides need to play a supporting role.  Speak the important parts, and use your slides as a backdrop for what you’re saying.
 
Hilary has provided a valuable strategy in her post, but how should someone approach crafting such a clearly-organized presentation?  If you’re just getting started speaking, it can be a real challenge to make a coherent talk and along with slid</p><p>5 0.32169861 <a title="82-lda-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-01-28-Startups%3A_Why_to_Share_Data_with_Academics.html">87 hilary mason data-2013-01-28-Startups: Why to Share Data with Academics</a></p>

Last week I wrote a bit about  how to share data with academics . This is the complimentary piece, on  why  you should invest the time and energy in sharing your data with the academic community.
 
As I was talking to people about this topic it became clear that there are really two different questions people ask. First, why do this at all? And second, what do I tell my boss?
 
Let’s start with the second one. This is what you should tell your boss:
  
  Academic research based on our work is a great press opportunity and demonstrates that credible people outside of our company find our work interesting.  
 Having researchers work on our data is an easy way to access highly educated brainpower, for free, that in no way competes with us. Who knows what interesting stuff they’ll come up with?

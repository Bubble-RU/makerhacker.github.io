Great data scientists come from such diverse backgrounds that it can be difficult to get a sense of whether someone is up to the job in just a short interview. In addition to the technical questions, I find it useful to have a few questions that draw out the more creative and less discrete elements of a candidate’s personality. Here are a few of my favorite questions.
  
  What was the last thing that you made for fun? 

This is my favorite question by far — I want to work with the kind of people who don’t turn their brains off when they go home. It’s also a great way to learn what gets people excited.

 
  What’s your favorite algorithm? Can you explain it to me?

One of the most fun and challenging parts of my job is setting bitly’s research agenda. We’re a startup, so this means prioritizing the set of questions we look into in the context of what will be most beneficial for the rest of the business, for the short and long-term, by creating opportunity and opening up potential futures. We work on a wide variety of projects, from pure research to  press collaborations  to  infrastructure  and  experimental products .
 
We always have a list of research questions way longer than we have time and resources to pursue, so we developed a process for evaluating whether a given question is worth pursuing at a particular time.

I get quite a few e-mail messages from very smart people who are looking to get started in data science. Here’s what I usually tell them:
 
The best way to get started in data science is to DO data science!
 
First, data scientists do three fundamentally different things:  math ,  code  (and engineer systems), and  communicate . Figure out which one of these you’re weakest at, and do a project that enhances your capabilities. Then figure out which one of these you’re best at, and pick a project which shows off your abilities.
 
Second, get to know other data scientists! If you’re in New York, try the  DataGotham events  list to find some meetups, and make sure to stay for the beers. Look for groups, like  DataKind , that need data skills put to work for good. No matter how much of a beginner</p><p>4 0.14169377 <a title="81-tfidf-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-01-17-Need_Data%3F_Start_Here.html">84 hilary mason data-2013-01-17-Need Data?

Data scientists need data, and good data is hard to find. I put together this bitly  bundle of research quality data sets  to collect as many useful data sets as possible in one place. The list includes such exciting and diverse things as spam, belly buttons, item pricing, social media, and face recognition, so you know there’s something that will intrigue anyone.
 
Have one to add? Let me know!

The video from my keynote at  Strange Loop 2010  is up!

 
You can watch the video here:  Machine Learning: A Love Story 
 
The original abstract:
  

Machine learning has come a long way in recent years — from a long-marginalized field so old it still has the word “machine” in the name, to the last, best hope for making sense of our massive flows of data.


The art of ‘data science’ is asking the right questions; the answers are generally trivial or impossible. This talk will focus more on questions than on answers. I’ll give a brief history of the field with a focus on the fundamental math and algorithmic tools that we use to address these kinds of problems, then walk through several descriptive and predictive scenarios.

If you’ve had a talk proposal accepted or been invited to speak at an event, you’ll usually get a chance to chat with the organizers before you show up to give your talk.
 
While you probably have a good idea of the topic of your talk (if you don’t, that’s a post for another day!), event organizers can be invaluable in helping you frame a talk that will succeed with their audience. They are on your side and they want you to do great, or they wouldn’t be hosting you at their event.
 
These are two questions that I always ask the organizers before I speak.
 
 Question 1: Who will be in the audience? 
 
Knowing the basic demographics of the audience is necessary to make sure you’re speaking at the right level and tuning the cultural references and humor for the room. I often speak to audiences o</p><p>5 0.46451613 <a title="81-lsi-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-03-18-Be_Ballsy..html">54 hilary mason data-2011-03-18-Be Ballsy.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Be Ballsy.    Posted:  March 18, 2011 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |    9  Comments »    
The things that are hardest to make yourself do are often the ones that end up being the most rewarding. 
 
(By rewarding I mean they lead to the kinds of experiences where you learn something new, get to meet amazing people, and generally have opportunities to do things you never would have imagined doing before. Rewarding does not only mean money.)
 
I was thinking about this at PyCon, after someone asked me how it felt, as a woman, to get up and give a technical talk to approximately 1,400 men. Five years ago I couldn’t have imagined myself doing something like that, but a series of small chances, risks, and experiences have led me here. And it was a ton of fun!
 
I thought about this again when Bryce sent me  a link to this post . OATV is hiring an analyst, and they haven’t received applications from women.

Great data scientists come from such diverse backgrounds that it can be difficult to get a sense of whether someone is up to the job in just a short interview. In addition to the technical questions, I find it useful to have a few questions that draw out the more creative and less discrete elements of a candidate’s personality. Here are a few of my favorite questions.
  
  What was the last thing that you made for fun? 

This is my favorite question by far — I want to work with the kind of people who don’t turn their brains off when they go home. It’s also a great way to learn what gets people excited.

 
  What’s your favorite algorithm? Can you explain it to me? 

I don’t know any data scientists who  haven’t  fallen in love with an algorithm, and I want to see both that enthusiasm and that the ca</p><p>2 0.34234634 <a title="81-lda-2" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-12-18-Using_Twitter%E2%80%99s_Lead-Gen_Card_to_Recruit_Beta_Testers.html">114 hilary mason data-2013-12-18-Using Twitter’s Lead-Gen Card to Recruit Beta Testers</a></p>

It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.
 
The tweet itself:
  
Love tech discussion but looking for a better community? Help me beta test a side project!  https://t.co/H3DYjbCy19

I created it pretty easily:
  
 First, go to  ads.twitter.com , log in, and go to “creatives”, then “cards”. 
 Click “Create Lead Generation Card”. It’s a big blue button.

<p>Introduction: Startups: Why to Share Data with Academics    Posted:  January 28, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |    5  Comments »    
Last week I wrote a bit about  how to share data with academics . This is the complimentary piece, on  why  you should invest the time and energy in sharing your data with the academic community.
 
As I was talking to people about this topic it became clear that there are really two different questions people ask. First, why do this at all? And second, what do I tell my boss?
 
Let’s start with the second one. This is what you should tell your boss:
  
  Academic research based on our work is a great press opportunity and demonstrates that credible people outside of our company find our work interesting.  
 Having researchers work on our data is an easy way to access highly educated brainpower, for free, that in no way competes with us. Who knows what interesting stuff they’ll come up with?

<p>Introduction: Need actual random numbers? Meet the NIST randomness beacon.    Posted:  September 30, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   projects   |  Tags:   beacon ,  python ,  random ,  randomness ,  randomnumbers  |    5  Comments »    
I wrote a  python module  that wraps that  NIST Randomness Beacon , making it simple to get truly random numbers in python.
 
It’s easy to use:
  b = Beacon()
print b.last_record()
print b.previous_record()
#and so on  
There’s also a handy generator for getting a set of  n  random numbers.
 
(One of the best gifts I ever got was a copy of  1,000,000 Random Numbers , and I’ve been intrigued ever since.)
 
Please note that this the randomness beacon is not intended to be a source of cryptographic keys — indeed, it’s a public set of numbers, so I wouldn’t recommend doing anything that could be compromised by someone else having the access to the  exact same set of numbers . Rather, this is interesting precisely for the scientific opportunities that</p><p>5 0.3136656 <a title="81-lda-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-06-22-My_Head_is_Open_Source%21.html">58 hilary mason data-2011-06-22-My Head is Open Source!</a></p>

Last night I visited friends at  Makerbot , where artist-in-residence  Jonathan Monaghan  scanned my head with a high-resolution laser scanner.
 
   
 
The  model is available on   Thingiverse  and can be printed on your friendly neighborhood makerbot or other 3d printer.
 
There are lots of other awesome models of people and things to play with, including  Stephen Colbert’s head .
 
I look forward to the emergence of plastic clone head armies!

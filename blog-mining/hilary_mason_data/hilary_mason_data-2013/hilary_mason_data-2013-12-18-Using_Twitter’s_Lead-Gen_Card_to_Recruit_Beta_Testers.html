It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.

 Twitter  rocks. It’s useful for  all kinds of things , but especially for chronicling a live event as it happens, including the pre-event discussion and post-conference wrapup.

    Google Now  is an extension to Google’s Android search app that uses all of the data that Google has about you along with what it can guess about your current context to present the information it thinks you need when it thinks you need it.
 
It’ll tell you to leave a bit early to make your next calendar event because of heavy traffic, or that it’s a friend’s birthday, or that there’s a cool cafe nearby where you are.
 
I think it’s amazing.
 
It’s amazing because this is the first Google product that takes ALL OF THE DATA that they have about us and actually makes it useful  for us . Not for advertisers.

<p>Introduction: Twitter: A greasemonkey script to show who follows you    Posted:  January 1, 2009 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   extension ,  firefox ,  greasemonkey ,  script ,  socialmedia ,  status ,  twitter  |    9  Comments »    
A couple of days ago I saw  @skap5′s comment :
  
“Dear Twitter  Is it too much to ask to add a follower marker so I can know if someone is following me and not just if  I am following them?”
  
I think that Twitter could benefit from displaying more information on the home page, and this idea was easy enough to code up. It should save some time and make the Twitter homepage that much more useful.
 
 The script displays a tiny icon on top of the portrait of people who are following you back on your Twitter home page. It leaves your non-followers alone, though it would be easy enough to develop a version that puts silly mustaches on them.
 
This is only a first version, and I welcome your comments and suggestions.

<p>Introduction: One Random Tweet, please.    Posted:  February 18, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   projects   |    4  Comments »         One random tweet.
  
It’s easy to believe that other people use social networks in the same way that you do. Your friends largely  do  use them the same way, which gives us an even more biased perspective.

 
Unfortunately, most networks don’t provide a way to explore representative communications that you’re not connected to.
 
Well, now you can!  One random tweet , please.
 
 Update:  There were some slight technical difficulties due to hitting Twitter’s oembed rate limit. They should be repaired now.

There’s a method to this madness!)</p><p>6 0.32888144 <a title="114-lsi-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2012/hilary_mason_data-2012-01-02-Why_do_I_miss_google_calendar_invites%3F.html">69 hilary mason data-2012-01-02-Why do I miss google calendar invites?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Startups: Why to Share Data with Academics    Posted:  January 28, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |    5  Comments »    
Last week I wrote a bit about  how to share data with academics . This is the complimentary piece, on  why  you should invest the time and energy in sharing your data with the academic community.
 
As I was talking to people about this topic it became clear that there are really two different questions people ask. First, why do this at all? And second, what do I tell my boss?
 
Let’s start with the second one. This is what you should tell your boss:
  
  Academic research based on our work is a great press opportunity and demonstrates that credible people outside of our company find our work interesting.  
 Having researchers work on our data is an easy way to access highly educated brainpower, for free, that in no way competes with us. Who knows what interesting stuff they’ll come up with?

Last night I visited friends at  Makerbot , where artist-in-residence  Jonathan Monaghan  scanned my head with a high-resolution laser scanner.
 
   
 
The  model is available on   Thingiverse  and can be printed on your friendly neighborhood makerbot or other 3d printer.
 
There are lots of other awesome models of people and things to play with, including  Stephen Colbert’s head .
 
I look forward to the emergence of plastic clone head armies!

 Will someone please invent a way to search for ideas? 
 
Short on inspiration? Harvest ideas from the web by searching Google for  “someone please invent”  and see what people are wishing for. Using quotes around “someone please invent” insures that Google searches for that exact phrase only.
 
You can further refine the query by adding related terms at the end of the query. For example, try searching for  “someone please invent” game*  to see game-related results.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.98905355 <a title="114-lda-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-12-18-Using_Twitter%E2%80%99s_Lead-Gen_Card_to_Recruit_Beta_Testers.html">114 hilary mason data-2013-12-18-Using Twitter’s Lead-Gen Card to Recruit Beta Testers</a></p>

It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.
 
The tweet itself:

I created it pretty easily:
  
 First, go to  ads.twitter.com , log in, and go to “creatives”, then “cards”. 
 Click “Create Lead Generation Card”. It’s a big blue button. 
 You can include a title and a short description. Curiously, you can also include a 600px by 150px image.

<p>Introduction: Need actual random numbers? Meet the NIST randomness beacon.    Posted:  September 30, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   projects   |  Tags:   beacon ,  python ,  random ,  randomness ,  randomnumbers  |    5  Comments »    
I wrote a  python module  that wraps that  NIST Randomness Beacon , making it simple to get truly random numbers in python.
 
It’s easy to use:
  b = Beacon()
print b.last_record()
print b.previous_record()
#and so on  
There’s also a handy generator for getting a set of  n  random numbers.
 
(One of the best gifts I ever got was a copy of  1,000,000 Random Numbers , and I’ve been intrigued ever since.)
 
Please note that this the randomness beacon is not intended to be a source of cryptographic keys — indeed, it’s a public set of numbers, so I wouldn’t recommend doing anything that could be compromised by someone else having the access to the  exact same set of numbers . Rather, this is interesting precisely for the scientific opportunities that</p><p>6 0.73603773 <a title="114-lda-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2010/hilary_mason_data-2010-02-16-Conference%3A_Search_and_Social_Media_2010.html">40 hilary mason data-2010-02-16-Conference: Search and Social Media 2010</a></p>

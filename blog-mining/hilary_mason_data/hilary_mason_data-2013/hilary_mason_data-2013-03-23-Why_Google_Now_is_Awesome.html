    Google Now  is an extension to Google’s Android search app that uses all of the data that Google has about you along with what it can guess about your current context to present the information it thinks you need when it thinks you need it.
 
It’ll tell you to leave a bit early to make your next calendar event because of heavy traffic, or that it’s a friend’s birthday, or that there’s a cool cafe nearby where you are.
 
I think it’s amazing.
 
It’s amazing because this is the first Google product that takes ALL OF THE DATA that they have about us and actually makes it useful  for us . Not for advertisers.

I keep missing Google calendar invites on both my personal and work accounts. I’ve had my google account for years (since 2004?) and assumed it was some quirk of how I had configured something along the way.
 
Today I was following Google’s  instructions for syncing calendars with an iOS device  and discovered that if you click calendar settings (which means click the gear icon then ‘calendar settings’), then ‘calendar’, then ‘notifications’ next to the calendar that you care about, you can turn on e-mail and SMS notifications for any given calendar.

Educators  routinely discuss  how students have trouble evaluating and using the results of their Google searches. There are really two parts to this problem, though, and while it’s true that students may struggle to identify reliable sources, before we can address that, we need to teach them how to write good queries.
 
It’s that old computer science maxim:  Garbage In, Garbage Out .
 
I like to teach students how to write interesting queries by playing games. This games force students to think about the queries they are writing, and not the results. I have no scientific proof of the results, but I do know that it keeps them entertained and thinking for a while!

 Will someone please invent a way to search for ideas? 
 
Short on inspiration? Harvest ideas from the web by searching Google for  “someone please invent”  and see what people are wishing for. Using quotes around “someone please invent” insures that Google searches for that exact phrase only.
 
You can further refine the query by adding related terms at the end of the query. For example, try searching for  “someone please invent” game*  to see game-related results.</p><p>6 0.12290304 <a title="97-tfidf-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2008/hilary_mason_data-2008-09-27-Firefox_Extension%3A_Open_Tab_Count_1.0.html">22 hilary mason data-2008-09-27-Firefox Extension: Open Tab Count 1.0</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Gitmarks: a peer-to-peer bookmarking system    Posted:  March 27, 2011 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog ,  projects   |    3  Comments »    
Several months ago I was looking for a command-line solution for group bookmark sharing. I couldn’t find one, so I coded up a quick python script that runs on top of git. It’s very much a hack that takes advantage of git to manage users, preserve the URL, the tags, the description of the URL (in the commit message) and also includes the content itself (so it’s grep-able later). If you put it on github, you get the additional commenting and collaboration features. You can check out my original code  here .
 
I’m very excited that  Far McKon  has picked up the project and has a great vision for where it can go. If you’re interested in hacking on it with him, let him know!

    Google Now  is an extension to Google’s Android search app that uses all of the data that Google has about you along with what it can guess about your current context to present the information it thinks you need when it thinks you need it.
 
It’ll tell you to leave a bit early to make your next calendar event because of heavy traffic, or that it’s a friend’s birthday, or that there’s a cool cafe nearby where you are.
 
I think it’s amazing.
 
It’s amazing because this is the first Google product that takes ALL OF THE DATA that they have about us and actually makes it useful  for us . Not for advertisers.

It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.
 
The tweet itself:
  
Love tech discussion but looking for a better community? Help me beta test a side project!  https://t.co/H3DYjbCy19

I created it pretty easily:
  
 First, go to  ads.twitter.com , log in, and go to “creatives”, then “cards”. 
 Click “Create Lead Generation Card”. It’s a big blue button.

<p>Introduction: Speaking: Spend at least 1/3 of the time practicing the talk    Posted:  July 5, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   speaking   |    3  Comments »    
 This week we welcome a guest contribution.  Matthew Trentacoste  is a recovering academic and a computer scientist at Adobe, where he writes software to make pretty pictures. He’s constantly curious, often about data, and cooks a lot. You can follow his exploits at  @mattttrent . 
 
In Hilary’s last post, she made the point that  your slides != your talk .  In a well-crafted talk, your message — in the form of the words you say — needs to dominate while the slides need to play a supporting role.  Speak the important parts, and use your slides as a backdrop for what you’re saying.
 
Hilary has provided a valuable strategy in her post, but how should someone approach crafting such a clearly-organized presentation?  If you’re just getting started speaking, it can be a real challenge to make a coherent talk and along with slid</p><p>5 0.26375878 <a title="97-lda-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-01-28-Startups%3A_Why_to_Share_Data_with_Academics.html">87 hilary mason data-2013-01-28-Startups: Why to Share Data with Academics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Startups: Why to Share Data with Academics    Posted:  January 28, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |    5  Comments »    
Last week I wrote a bit about  how to share data with academics . This is the complimentary piece, on  why  you should invest the time and energy in sharing your data with the academic community.
 
As I was talking to people about this topic it became clear that there are really two different questions people ask. First, why do this at all? And second, what do I tell my boss?
 
Let’s start with the second one. This is what you should tell your boss:
  
  Academic research based on our work is a great press opportunity and demonstrates that credible people outside of our company find our work interesting.  
 Having researchers work on our data is an easy way to access highly educated brainpower, for free, that in no way competes with us. Who knows what interesting stuff they’ll come up with?

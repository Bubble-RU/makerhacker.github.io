<p>Introduction: Come speak at DataGotham 2014!    Posted:  April 9, 2014 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |   Leave a comment »    
Please join us for DataGotham 2014! We’ll be hosting the conference Friday, Sep 26th at the  Broad Street Ballroom  in the financial district in New York City. We look forward to getting New York’s data community together and having a great time.
 
The  Call for Proposals  is now open, and  we want you to speak . Our speakers come from every industry and type of background where people use data, and the best talks are ones where you tell us your real experience with a data project. What problem were you trying to solve? What went wrong? What went right? How does the story end? Or did it?
 
If you think you might have a story to tell but aren’t sure,  drop me a note . I’m happy to help you frame a successful talk, and we welcome speakers at all levels of experience. Some of our most popular talks have been from first-time speakers!</p><p>2 <a title="hilary_mason_data-2014-115" href="../hilary_mason_data-2014/hilary_mason_data-2014-02-14-Play_with_your_food%21.html">hilary mason data-2014-02-14-Play with your food!</a></p>

I spent a few minutes this week putting together a  quick script to pull data  from the  Locu API . Locu has done the hard work of gathering and parsing menus from around the US and has a lot of interesting data (and a  good data team ).
 
The API is easy to query by menu item (like “cheeseburger”,  my favorite ) and by running my little script I quickly had data for the prices of cheeseburgers in my set of zip codes (the 100 most populated metro areas in the US).
 
   
 
   
 
I’m a big fan of Pete Warden’s OpenHeatMap tool for making quick map visualizations, and was able to come up with the following:
 
The blue map is the average price of a cheeseburger by zip, with the red one showing the average price of pizza. The most expensive average cheeseburger can be found in Santa Clara, CA, ironically the city currently hosting the  Str</p><br/><br/><br/>

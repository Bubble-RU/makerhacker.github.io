Fast Company came to our office to film a short interview with me. If you’ve been following  bitly  closely there won’t be any surprises for you here, but I did get to talk about some of the exciting projects that we’re working on.
 
The best part about filming the interview was getting back to my computer after, where my clever co-workers had been silently answering the questions along with me in our chat room — with a lot more snark.</p><p>2 <a title="hilary_mason_data-2011-67" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-10-31-Happy_Halloween.html">hilary mason data-2011-10-31-Happy Halloween</a></p>

I just got home from the  Web 2.0 Summit , a three-day conference that was packed with announcements, interesting ideas, and good conversations.
 
My short talk,  The Secrets of our Data Subconscious , touches on how the data we generate online interactions with the physical world spatially and through time, and on the relationships between the things we consume (in private) and the things we broadcast (in public).</p><p>4 <a title="hilary_mason_data-2011-65" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-10-21-I%E2%80%99m_on_Fortune%E2%80%99s_40_Under_40%3A_Ones_to_Watch_list%21.html">hilary mason data-2011-10-21-I’m on Fortune’s 40 Under 40: Ones to Watch list!</a></p>

This is probably the least likely thing you would expect to appear on this site, but it’s true! I appear in the November 2011 issue of Glamour alongside Jess Lee, Caterina Fake, and Stacy Brown-Philpot, in a story by Kara Swisher. There will also be a panel event tomorrow morning to talk about  the article .
 
I don’t usually speak publicly about the women in tech issue, for a variety of reasons, primarily: if I’m speaking about women in technology I am not speaking  about technology , it’s not a topic that I have much insight on, it ignores the other dimensions of the problem, and I would really rather work hard and be known as a great technologist than a great  woman  technologist.

 Food+Tech Connect  is putting together a fun series of essays where technologists and foodies share their opinions on how to hack to the food system.
 
They also had a great party, with liquid nitrogen ice cream and other very cool foods.
 
I’m honored to have been asked to participate, especially since food and tech are two of my favorite things! I decided to write about a hack that I did about three years ago, where I wrote a parser and built a statistical model of chocolate chip cookie recipes that I crawled off of the web.
  
I’d like to tell you the story of the Ultimate Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe.


This isn’t the Neiman Marcus $65,000 cookie recipe.

A friend asked me which of three startup business books she should read.  Obama’s reading list since entering office  has nothing surprising on it.
 
The most valuable books I read this year have been stories of things very different from what I spend most of my time thinking about.
 
One of my favorites was China Meiville’s  The City & The City , which I loved for the ambition and artistry, and another was Simon Winchester’s  The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary , which I loved for the descriptions of creating an analog, scalable information system.
 
What have you read recently that was really great?
 
 Edit:  Thanks for the recommendations! There are also a bunch over on  Google Plus .</p><p>10 <a title="hilary_mason_data-2011-59" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-07-29-Uses_This.html">hilary mason data-2011-07-29-Uses This</a></p>

Last night I visited friends at  Makerbot , where artist-in-residence  Jonathan Monaghan  scanned my head with a high-resolution laser scanner.
 
   
 
The  model is available on   Thingiverse  and can be printed on your friendly neighborhood makerbot or other 3d printer.
 
There are lots of other awesome models of people and things to play with, including  Stephen Colbert’s head .
 
I look forward to the emergence of plastic clone head armies!

I’m really excited that  An Introduction to Machine Learning with Web Data  is now available for purchase!
 
This is a 2 hour and 43 minute instructional video that walks you through basic machine learning algorithms, first theoretically and mathematically, and then with Python example code (which is available  here ).
 
This video is an instructional take and builds on the material I covered in my  Strange Loop 2010  keynote  Machine Learning: A Love Story  and the  Data Bootcamp  I did with Joe Adler, Drew Conway, and Jake Hofman at  the  Strata Conference  in February.

I work with a lot of data, and while I’d like to pretend it’s all in upside-down quasi-indexed b-tree rocket ships or some other advanced database, the truth is that much of it is in text files. I often find myself wanting to see a random line from one of these files, just to get a sense of what the data looks like.
 
I thought there must be an easy  bash  way to do this, but I couldn’t find it (‘shuf’ isn’t installed on my server), so I turned to twitter, and now I’m pleased to present more methods for finding a random line than you ever expected!

Several months ago I was looking for a command-line solution for group bookmark sharing. I couldn’t find one, so I coded up a quick python script that runs on top of git. It’s very much a hack that takes advantage of git to manage users, preserve the URL, the tags, the description of the URL (in the commit message) and also includes the content itself (so it’s grep-able later). If you put it on github, you get the additional commenting and collaboration features. You can check out my original code  here .
 
I’m very excited that  Far McKon  has picked up the project and has a great vision for where it can go. If you’re interested in hacking on it with him, let him know!

The things that are hardest to make yourself do are often the ones that end up being the most rewarding. 
 
(By rewarding I mean they lead to the kinds of experiences where you learn something new, get to meet amazing people, and generally have opportunities to do things you never would have imagined doing before. Rewarding does not only mean money.)
 
I was thinking about this at PyCon, after someone asked me how it felt, as a woman, to get up and give a technical talk to approximately 1,400 men. Five years ago I couldn’t have imagined myself doing something like that, but a series of small chances, risks, and experiences have led me here. And it was a ton of fun!
 
I thought about this again when Bryce sent me  a link to this post . OATV is hiring an analyst, and they haven’t received applications from women.

I gave the opening keynote this morning at  PyCon .
 
The one thing that everyone in the room at PyCon has in common is that we all  love  to code. I used that as the central theme of the talk, spoke about the constructs that give us joy, the history of some of our favorite patterns (they date as far back as the 60s!) and proposed that we think about the way we’ll compute fifty years into the future. There’s also a bit of fun data hacking, of course.

On Friday, January 28th I hopped in a cab and went up to NPR’s Bryant Park recording studio for a fifteen minute chat with  Ira Flatow , host of  Science Friday . I’ve been a big fan of Ira and Science Friday since I discovered the show years ago, and it was a very exciting honor to be a guest.
 
   
 
The image at the right is a snapshot I took with my phone while nervously waiting outside the studio.
 
The title of the segment is the rather dramatic  Privacy At Stake As Sites Track Online Preferences . Our conversation wound around the issues of tracking user data online, and the potential opportunities and dangers that all users of online services face.

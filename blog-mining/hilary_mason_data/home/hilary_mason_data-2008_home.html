     Open tab count extension in the status bar
 
  
How many tabs do you have open in your browser right now?
 
Did you have to count manually? Are you using Firefox? Try the  open tab count  extension!
 
I created this extension because I wanted to explore memory management in browser tabs, and I was curious about the Firefox extension architecture. I’m not quite as eager to explore memory hacks in Firefox now that Google Chrome is out and handles that issue natively, but I’m still using this extension to monitor my tab (over)usage.
 
The extension puts a small icon in the status bar alongside the number of open tabs. If more than one window is open, the extension shows the number of open tabs in the current window / the total number of open tabs.
 
Please let me know below if you have any comments!

I’ve always been skeptical of and fascinated by personality tests. On the one hand, it’s your personality — who could possibly know more about you than you do? On the other, there’s something alluring about quantifying your characteristics, especially when you can compare them to others.

Hello, and welcome to everyone who found this site via Torley’s story on the  Second Life blog !
 
I lead the  Immersive Media Lab  at  J&W; University . Several of our projects have utilized Second Life, including  Virtual Morocco  (cultural exchange and tourism promotion for the country of Morocco) and  SLMetrics  (a study of behavior modeling in virtual environments).
 
This isn’t a Second Life blog, but you will find LSL scripts and other related ephemera around.

I was talking to my web programming seminar about regular expressions and made an allusion to the  xkcd comic on that topic . Unfortunately, none of them had seen it, probably because none of them were familiar with xkcd.
 
Students should become familiar with the concepts and practice of the discipline, but also with the culture and in-jokes that will help them fit in when they get into industry or graduate school. I also like to get people to laugh in ways that are relevant to the subject material (yes, I use a lot of cheesy geek jokes — ask me to tell you my LISP joke sometime).
 
I asked the Twitter community what other geek cultural elements I should introduce the students to, and here are the answers:
  
 The comics:  xkcd ,  Penny Arcade  
 The cute things:  Kitty Hell ,  Pink Tentacle ,  Cute Overload ,</p><p>6 <a title="hilary_mason_data-2008-17" href="../hilary_mason_data-2008/hilary_mason_data-2008-03-17-LSL%3A_Notecard_Selector.html">hilary mason data-2008-03-17-LSL: Notecard Selector</a></p>

One of my friendly librarian colleagues in SL asked if I had a script to generate dialogs and allow users to select notecards handy. I didn’t, so I coded it up. It seems like it could be useful to others, so here you go:
 
This script is in LSL, for Second Life. Just  copy and paste it   into a script, throw a few notecards into the object, and you’ll be ready to go!
  
//  Notecard Selector
//  by Ann Enigma
//  This script presents users with a list of notecards in a dialog box, and allows them to select one
//  Note: The names of the notecards must be less than 24 characters long

I’m at SXSW, and I want an ability to see the latest Tweets from the group of Twitterers that I follow who are here in the area. I also have a limited number of text messages on my phone (1500, but still).
 
I coded up a quick app that allows you to great a group of twitterers and see their latest tweet on a mobile-friend page.  Check it out .

My  research group  had some fun controlling SL with a Wii-mote a few weeks ago. It’s easier than you think! Several people have asked how we did it, so I hope these quick instructions might come in handy.
  
 Download, install, and run  DarwiinRemote . 
 Turn Bluetooth on on the Macbook. You can do this by opening the Bluetooth Preferences Pane (Apple menu, System Preferences and choose “Bluetooth” under Hardware) and clicking the big “Turn Bluetooth On” button. If Bluetooth is already on, you can skip this step! 
 Hold the Wii-mote in front of the Macbook and press buttons 1 and 2 simultaneously. The LEDs on the Wii-mote will flash. 
 As you move the Wii-mote, you’ll see your movement plotted on the screen, as you see below.

The vendor containing this hat was recently deleted from Virtual Morocco by an employee of Linden Lab without any notification to me. Why? Because an anonymous person complained that it is “broadly offensive”.
 
 Virtual Morocco  was created to be both a tourism promotion platform and a space for cultural exchange. It was built entirely by undergraduate students as an educational service-learning project.
 
We give space in the Marrakesh Marketplace to several Moroccan artisans with virtual goods for sale. Our only requirements are that they keep everything appropriate to the sim’s theme and to the educational context of the space. The vendor selling the hat was owned by a college student (not from our institution) who specializes in items appropriate for the Morocco of the 1940s.

 Twitter  rocks. It’s useful for  all kinds of things , but especially for chronicling a live event as it happens, including the pre-event discussion and post-conference wrapup.
 
We’re very excited to be hosting  NewB Camp  here in Providence, RI on February 23rd. In preparation for the event,  Sara  created a  NewBCamp  Twitter account and I coded up this quick script to pull in all tweets related to the conference.
 
It examines all of your followers tweets for a particular phrase or tag, and then reposts those tweets containing the tag to its own timeline with the author’s name prepended. I’m running this as a cron job on my hosting account. You can see it in action  here .
 
This is a quick hack. It has a couple of issue that I’m aware of:

The video from my keynote at  Strange Loop 2010  is up!

The original abstract:
  

Machine learning has come a long way in recent years — from a long-marginalized field so old it still has the word “machine” in the name, to the last, best hope for making sense of our massive flows of data.


The art of ‘data science’ is asking the right questions; the answers are generally trivial or impossible. This talk will focus more on questions than on answers. I’ll give a brief history of the field with a focus on the fundamental math and algorithmic tools that we use to address these kinds of problems, then walk through several descriptive and predictive scenarios.


Finally, I’ll show one example syst</p><p>2 <a title="hilary_mason_data-2010-48" href="../hilary_mason_data-2010/hilary_mason_data-2010-09-04-Twitter_Succeeds_Because_it_Fails.html">hilary mason data-2010-09-04-Twitter Succeeds Because it Fails</a></p>

How can twitter be so popular and successful if it’s down   all the time  ?
 
We base statements like this on the assumption that quality of a web application maps linearly to the application’s stability. This is obviously true for most sites most of the time, but things get interesting at the edge where rare, unpredictable failure actually enables more complex human interactions around the service.
 
Unlike e-mail, twitter etiquette doesn’t demand that you read or reply to every message from every person you follow (or who follows you). Combine that lightweight social touch with occasional technical issues and human communication patterns, and we start to see some interesting behavior.
 
 Twitter’s lack of reliability as a platform allows us to use the technical failings to mask our own social imperfections .

I received this e-mail via my  contact form :
  

I just discovered you via a Google search because I’m highly considering attending this year’s upcoming Hadoop World in NYC. I appreciate your page that you wrote up after attending last year’s event. I’m wondering if you feel that Hadoop has enough momentum and support to be a “here to stay” technology worth investing one’s time and education into, or is it possible it might fade and be deprecated by something else as the need for big data analysis continues to grow? …

  
I’ve had a few similar conversation with people lately, and I thought posting my response might help others making similar decisions. The e-mail is referencing my post from  last year’s hadoop world NYC .

Several months ago, on a whim inspired by an off-hand comment from  Chris , I created a bot to bring the wonders of the  Unix bc language  to twitter.
 
 bc  is a command-line calculator that’s fast and has the capacity to do some fairly complex math.
 
Try it out on the command line:
  
echo '100 / 10' | bc -l
  
…Or by  sending a direct message to bc_l  (if you follow  bc_l  it will follow you back within a few hours).
 
I released the code under GPL, and it’s available on github:  http://github.com/hmason/tweetbc .
 
John Cook mentions the bot and makes some great observations in his post  three surprises with bc .</p><p>6 <a title="hilary_mason_data-2010-44" href="../hilary_mason_data-2010/hilary_mason_data-2010-06-24-Conference%3A_Web2_Expo_SF.html">hilary mason data-2010-06-24-Conference: Web2 Expo SF</a></p>

I gave a talk called  A Data-driven Look at the Realtime Web Ecosystem  at the  Web2Expo SF  conference in May in San Francisco. I attempted to highlight some of the interesting facets of the bit.ly data set, and it appeared to be well-received (showing up on  TechCrunch ,  ZDNet , and a few other places).
 
I attended the full conference, and it was great. The attendees were extremely international and I met a ton of fascinating people.
 
I’m still getting a couple of e-mail requests per week for my slides and materials, so they’re posted below for posterity.

Welcome! I’ve gotten several hundred e-mails about my e-mail management code. I do want to share it as soon as possible. Here are the answers to the most common questions.
  Why separate scripts?  
My philosophy is based on the unix command-line tool model; Each script should be simple and useful alone, but when combined together they become extremely powerful.
  Why don’t we have the code yet?!  
I had no idea the talk would be shared beyond the couple hundred people in the audience or that it would be so popular! I started my position at  bit.ly  the same day I gave that IgniteNYC presentation, and I also have some  other   awesome   projects  that are competing for time.
 
I have to admit that the trained classifiers are all based on my personal data and were also trained mostly through tweaking in ipython.</p><p>8 <a title="hilary_mason_data-2010-42" href="../hilary_mason_data-2010/hilary_mason_data-2010-04-18-Stop_talking%2C_start_coding.html">hilary mason data-2010-04-18-Stop talking, start coding</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stop talking, start coding    Posted:  April 18, 2010 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog   |    65  Comments »    
I read  Out of the Loop in Silicon Valley  in the NYTimes today, which explores how and why women are under-repesented in tech startups. From the number of retweets I saw and the clicks through  bit.ly  links (12,579 at the time of this posting), it’s been getting a lot of attention.
 
There are some very strong, compelling themes in this article. Computer science and engineering to have an “image problem”; the way we teach math to elementary school students is horrible and turns way too many away.
 
I don’t want to nitpick the article, but there are a few statements that reinforce the very damaging stereotypes that the article sets out to dispel.
  

“When women take on the challenges of an engineering or computer science education in college, some studies suggest that they struggle against a distinct set of personal, psycho-social issues… Even women who soldier</p><p>9 <a title="hilary_mason_data-2010-41" href="../hilary_mason_data-2010/hilary_mason_data-2010-03-14-Art_and_Technology%3A_Seven_on_Seven.html">hilary mason data-2010-03-14-Art and Technology: Seven on Seven</a></p>

I’m honored and excited to be participating in Rhizome’s new conference  Seven on Seven , where technologists and artists are paired up to create a completely new project in 24-hours.
 
The formal description:
  
Seven on Seven will pair seven leading artists with seven game-changing technologists in teams of two, and challenge them to develop something new –be it an application, social media, artwork, product, or whatever they imagine– over the course of a single day. The seven teams will unveil their ideas at a one-day event at the New Museum on April 17th.
  
I really love this idea because the time constraints and the inherent discomfort of the situation (working in an unfamiliar space with an unfamiliar person) makes it likely that we’ll be able to accomplish something creative and unexpected.

I recently attended the  Third Annual Workshop on Search and Social Media , an academic workshop with very strong industry participation. The workshop was packed, and had some of the most informative and interesting panel discussions I’ve seen (not counting the one I spoke on!).
 
 Daniel Tunkelang  did a great job of writing up the specific presentations on his site and  on the ACM blog , so I won’t attempt to re-create the presentations line by line at this late date. Rather, I’d like to highlight a few open problems and research questions that came out of the discussions that I hope to see developed in the next year.

Over at  NYC Resistor , it was getting cold, and we needed a doorbell so visitors wouldn’t be stranded outside when the building was locked. A standard wireless model didn’t work reliably (the space is on the fifth floor, just out of range), so various members generally resorted to writing their phone numbers on a sign on the front door when they were expecting guests.
 
Since almost everyone has a mobile phone already, and SMS-based solution seemed appropriate. In order to implement this we need two things:
  
 An SMS shortcode 
 A system to notify when the shortcode is triggered 
  
It’s irritating and expensive to acquire your own shortcode, but there are several services that will allow you to use one in exchange for a small fee or advertisements in your messages.  TextMarks  is my</p><br/><br/><br/>

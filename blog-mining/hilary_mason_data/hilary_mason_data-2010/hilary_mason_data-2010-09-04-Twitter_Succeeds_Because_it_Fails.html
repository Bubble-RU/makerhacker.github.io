I recently attended the  Third Annual Workshop on Search and Social Media , an academic workshop with very strong industry participation. The workshop was packed, and had some of the most informative and interesting panel discussions I’ve seen (not counting the one I spoke on!).
 
 Daniel Tunkelang  did a great job of writing up the specific presentations on his site and  on the ACM blog , so I won’t attempt to re-create the presentations line by line at this late date. Rather, I’d like to highlight a few open problems and research questions that came out of the discussions that I hope to see developed in the next year.

Your title slide should focus on the title of the talk. It should also include your name and affiliation, your logo if you have a cute one, possibly your blog or e-mail address if you want people to get in touch, and your twitter handle.
 
Here’s one of mine:
 
   
 
I usually mention that the beginning of the talk that if people have questions they can tweet them at me. This isn’t just because Twitter is a great way to get questions from people too shy to speak up (or who don’t get an opportunity). Here’s the hack: letting people know that you’ll be reading everything they say about your talk on Twitter makes them more likely to say nice things.
 
Further, in a multi-track conference, people who weren’t actually in your talk (or were there but not paying a lot of attention) will judge your</p><p>4 0.10987464 <a title="48-tfidf-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2008/hilary_mason_data-2008-01-22-Create_a_group_Twitter_account.html">13 hilary mason data-2008-01-22-Create a group Twitter account</a></p>

 Twitter  rocks. It’s useful for  all kinds of things , but especially for chronicling a live event as it happens, including the pre-event discussion and post-conference wrapup.
 
We’re very excited to be hosting  NewB Camp  here in Providence, RI on February 23rd. In preparation for the event,  Sara  created a  NewBCamp  Twitter account and I coded up this quick script to pull in all tweets related to the conference.
 
It examines all of your followers tweets for a particular phrase or tag, and then reposts those tweets containing the tag to its own timeline with the author’s name prepended. I’m running this as a cron job on my hosting account. You can see it in action  here .
 
This is a quick hack. It has a couple of issue that I’m aware of:

A couple of days ago I saw  @skap5′s comment :
  
“Dear Twitter  Is it too much to ask to add a follower marker so I can know if someone is following me and not just if  I am following them?”
  
I think that Twitter could benefit from displaying more information on the home page, and this idea was easy enough to code up. It should save some time and make the Twitter homepage that much more useful.
 
 The script displays a tiny icon on top of the portrait of people who are following you back on your Twitter home page. It leaves your non-followers alone, though it would be easy enough to develop a version that puts silly mustaches on them.
 
This is only a first version, and I welcome your comments and suggestions.

Slides are the supporting structure for your talk,  not the main event . Speak the meaty and informative portion of the presentation out loud and use slides as a backdrop to set either the emotional tone or reinforce the message that you are trying to convey.
 
   
 
For example, I love using this image of  Obama in Berlin  as a backdrop when I talk about the growth of social data over the last several years. In this image  every single person has a device  and is generating their own data about their shared social experience. The content of the image supports what is otherwise a fairly abstract statement, and you can feel the excitement of the crowd, boosting the excitement that I want to share about the possibilities of social data.
 
This is a particular style of slide design will fail for situations wher</p><p>4 0.32858452 <a title="48-lsi-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2008/hilary_mason_data-2008-03-08-Following_a_group_of_Twitterers_without_exhausting_SMS.html">16 hilary mason data-2008-03-08-Following a group of Twitterers without exhausting SMS</a></p>

I’m at SXSW, and I want an ability to see the latest Tweets from the group of Twitterers that I follow who are here in the area. I also have a limited number of text messages on my phone (1500, but still).
 
I coded up a quick app that allows you to great a group of twitterers and see their latest tweet on a mobile-friend page.  Check it out .

<p>Introduction: Twitter Succeeds Because it Fails    Posted:  September 4, 2010 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   failure ,  twitter  |    9  Comments »    
How can twitter be so popular and successful if it’s down   all the time  ?
 
We base statements like this on the assumption that quality of a web application maps linearly to the application’s stability. This is obviously true for most sites most of the time, but things get interesting at the edge where rare, unpredictable failure actually enables more complex human interactions around the service.
 
Unlike e-mail, twitter etiquette doesn’t demand that you read or reply to every message from every person you follow (or who follows you). Combine that lightweight social touch with occasional technical issues and human communication patterns, and we start to see some interesting behavior.
 
 Twitter’s lack of reliability as a platform allows us to use the technical failings to mask our own social imperfections .

<p>Introduction: Speaking: Spend at least 1/3 of the time practicing the talk    Posted:  July 5, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   speaking   |    3  Comments »    
 This week we welcome a guest contribution.  Matthew Trentacoste  is a recovering academic and a computer scientist at Adobe, where he writes software to make pretty pictures. He’s constantly curious, often about data, and cooks a lot. You can follow his exploits at  @mattttrent . 
 
In Hilary’s last post, she made the point that  your slides != your talk .  In a well-crafted talk, your message — in the form of the words you say — needs to dominate while the slides need to play a supporting role.  Speak the important parts, and use your slides as a backdrop for what you’re saying.
 
Hilary has provided a valuable strategy in her post, but how should someone approach crafting such a clearly-organized presentation?  If you’re just getting started speaking, it can be a real challenge to make a coherent talk and along with slid</p><p>3 0.29774934 <a title="48-lda-3" href="../hilary_mason_data-2009/hilary_mason_data-2009-10-16-Data%3A_first_and_last_names_from_the_US_Census.html">34 hilary mason data-2009-10-16-Data: first and last names from the US Census</a></p>

I’ve found myself in need of a name distribution for a few projects recently, so I thought I would post it here so I won’t have to go looking for it again.
 
The data is available from the US Census Bureau (from 1990 census)  here , and I have it here in a friendly MySQL *.sql format (it will create the tables and insert the data). There are three tables: male first names, female first names, and surnames.
 
I’ve noted several issues in the data that are likely the result of typos, so make sure to do your own validation if your application requires it.
 
The format is simple:
  
 the name 
 frequency (percentage of people in the sampled population with that name) 
 cumulative frequency (as you read down the list, the percentage of total population covered) 
 rank

<p>Introduction: One Random Tweet, please.    Posted:  February 18, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   projects   |    4  Comments »         One random tweet.
  
It’s easy to believe that other people use social networks in the same way that you do. Your friends largely  do  use them the same way, which gives us an even more biased perspective.

 
Unfortunately, most networks don’t provide a way to explore representative communications that you’re not connected to.
 
Well, now you can!  One random tweet , please.
 
 Update:  There were some slight technical difficulties due to hitting Twitter’s oembed rate limit. They should be repaired now.
  (Note: between this and  bookbookgoose.com  I’m on a bit of a random kick lately. There’s a method to this madness!)</p><p>5 0.29257193 <a title="48-lda-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-08-21-What_do_you_read_that_changes_the_way_you_think%3F.html">60 hilary mason data-2011-08-21-What do you read that changes the way you think?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What do you read that changes the way you think?    Posted:  August 21, 2011 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   books ,  philosophy ,  reading  |    24  Comments »    
A friend asked me which of three startup business books she should read.  Obama’s reading list since entering office  has nothing surprising on it.
 
The most valuable books I read this year have been stories of things very different from what I spend most of my time thinking about.
 
One of my favorites was China Meiville’s  The City & The City , which I loved for the ambition and artistry, and another was Simon Winchester’s  The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary , which I loved for the descriptions of creating an analog, scalable information system.
 
What have you read recently that was really great?
 
 Edit:  Thanks for the recommendations!

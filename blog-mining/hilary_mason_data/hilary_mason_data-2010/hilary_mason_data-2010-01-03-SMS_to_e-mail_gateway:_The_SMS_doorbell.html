One of my friendly librarian colleagues in SL asked if I had a script to generate dialogs and allow users to select notecards handy. I didn’t, so I coded it up. It seems like it could be useful to others, so here you go:

A couple of days ago I saw  @skap5′s comment :
  
“Dear Twitter  Is it too much to ask to add a follower marker so I can know if someone is following me and not just if  I am following them?”
  
I think that Twitter could benefit from displaying more information on the home page, and this idea was easy enough to code up. It should save some time and make the Twitter homepage that much more useful.
 
 The script displays a tiny icon on top of the portrait of people who are following you back on your Twitter home page. It leaves your non-followers alone, though it would be easy enough to develop a version that puts silly mustaches on them.
 
This is only a first version, and I welcome your comments and suggestions.

<p>Introduction: Introbot: A Script to Ease the Process of Writing Introductory E-mails    Posted:  January 22, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   projects   |    1  Comment »    
The introductory e-mail is a message where I introduce two (or more) people who have yet to meet each other. It generally takes the highly structured form, “Salutation A and B! A does X. B does Y. You should meet for reason Z. Valediction.”
 
I almost always do opt-in intros, where I’ll write to each party separately and make sure it’s okay if I share their information, and explain why I think it’s worth their time. I find this approach to be more respectful of people’s privacy and busy schedules.
 
That means that by the time they get the formal introduction, they generally know what’s going on. Still, I find these messages peculiarly stressful.

I’m at SXSW, and I want an ability to see the latest Tweets from the group of Twitterers that I follow who are here in the area. I also have a limited number of text messages on my phone (1500, but still).
 
I coded up a quick app that allows you to great a group of twitterers and see their latest tweet on a mobile-friend page.  Check it out .

I wrote a  python module  that wraps that  NIST Randomness Beacon , making it simple to get truly random numbers in python.
 
It’s easy to use:
  b = Beacon()
print b.last_record()
print b.previous_record()
#and so on  
There’s also a handy generator for getting a set of  n  random numbers.
 
(One of the best gifts I ever got was a copy of  1,000,000 Random Numbers , and I’ve been intrigued ever since.)
 
Please note that this the randomness beacon is not intended to be a source of cryptographic keys — indeed, it’s a public set of numbers, so I wouldn’t recommend doing anything that could be compromised by someone else having the access to the  exact same set of numbers . Rather, this is interesting precisely for the scientific opportunities that</p><p>5 0.3039012 <a title="39-lsi-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-03-27-Gitmarks%3A_a_peer-to-peer_bookmarking_system.html">55 hilary mason data-2011-03-27-Gitmarks: a peer-to-peer bookmarking system</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Gitmarks: a peer-to-peer bookmarking system    Posted:  March 27, 2011 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog ,  projects   |    3  Comments »    
Several months ago I was looking for a command-line solution for group bookmark sharing. I couldn’t find one, so I coded up a quick python script that runs on top of git. It’s very much a hack that takes advantage of git to manage users, preserve the URL, the tags, the description of the URL (in the commit message) and also includes the content itself (so it’s grep-able later). If you put it on github, you get the additional commenting and collaboration features. You can check out my original code  here .
 
I’m very excited that  Far McKon  has picked up the project and has a great vision for where it can go. If you’re interested in hacking on it with him, let him know!

<p>Introduction: SMS to e-mail gateway: The SMS doorbell    Posted:  January 3, 2010 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog ,  projects   |  Tags:   code ,  nycresistor ,  python ,  textmarks  |    5  Comments »    
Over at  NYC Resistor , it was getting cold, and we needed a doorbell so visitors wouldn’t be stranded outside when the building was locked. A standard wireless model didn’t work reliably (the space is on the fifth floor, just out of range), so various members generally resorted to writing their phone numbers on a sign on the front door when they were expecting guests.
 
Since almost everyone has a mobile phone already, and SMS-based solution seemed appropriate. In order to implement this we need two things:
  
 An SMS shortcode 
 A system to notify when the shortcode is triggered 
  
It’s irritating and expensive to acquire your own shortcode, but there are several services that will allow you to use one in exchange for a small fee or advertisements in your messages.

A couple of days ago I saw  @skap5′s comment :
  
“Dear Twitter  Is it too much to ask to add a follower marker so I can know if someone is following me and not just if  I am following them?”
  
I think that Twitter could benefit from displaying more information on the home page, and this idea was easy enough to code up. It should save some time and make the Twitter homepage that much more useful.
 
 The script displays a tiny icon on top of the portrait of people who are following you back on your Twitter home page. It leaves your non-followers alone, though it would be easy enough to develop a version that puts silly mustaches on them.
 
This is only a first version, and I welcome your comments and suggestions.

I wrote a  python module  that wraps that  NIST Randomness Beacon , making it simple to get truly random numbers in python.
 
It’s easy to use:
  b = Beacon()
print b.last_record()
print b.previous_record()
#and so on  
There’s also a handy generator for getting a set of  n  random numbers.
 
(One of the best gifts I ever got was a copy of  1,000,000 Random Numbers , and I’ve been intrigued ever since.)

It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.
 
The tweet itself:

I created it pretty easily:
  
 First, go to  ads.twitter.com , log in, and go to “creatives”, then “cards”. 
 Click “Create Lead Generation Card”. It’s a big blue button.

<p>Introduction: Startups: Why to Share Data with Academics    Posted:  January 28, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |    5  Comments »    
Last week I wrote a bit about  how to share data with academics . This is the complimentary piece, on  why  you should invest the time and energy in sharing your data with the academic community.
 
As I was talking to people about this topic it became clear that there are really two different questions people ask. First, why do this at all? And second, what do I tell my boss?
 
Let’s start with the second one. This is what you should tell your boss:
  
  Academic research based on our work is a great press opportunity and demonstrates that credible people outside of our company find our work interesting.  
 Having researchers work on our data is an easy way to access highly educated brainpower, for free, that in no way competes with us. Who knows what interesting stuff they’ll come up with?

Welcome! I’ve gotten several hundred e-mails about my e-mail management code. I do want to share it as soon as possible. Here are the answers to the most common questions.
  Why separate scripts?  
My philosophy is based on the unix command-line tool model; Each script should be simple and useful alone, but when combined together they become extremely powerful.
  Why don’t we have the code yet?!  
I had no idea the talk would be shared beyond the couple hundred people in the audience or that it would be so popular! I started my position at  bit.ly  the same day I gave that IgniteNYC presentation, and I also have some  other   awesome   projects  that are competing for time.
 
I have to admit that the trained classifiers are all based on my personal data and were also trained mostly through tweaking in ipython.</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 E-mail automation, questions and answers    Posted:  May 27, 2010 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog ,  projects   |  Tags:   email ,  ignitenyc  |    66  Comments »     Welcome!

</p><p>8 I have certainly thought about commercializing the application, but I’m uncomfortable asking people to give me access to their personal e-mail data (even if there are very interesting things to be learned by aggregate analysis). [sent-17, score-0.363]

    I recently gave a talk at IgniteNYC on  How to Replace Yourself with a Very Small Shell Script .
 
The  Ignite  events are a fun blend of performance, technology, and speaking skill. Each presenter gives a five minute talk with twenty slides that auto-advance after 15 seconds.
 
The title of my talk is a classic geek reference (you can  get the t-shirt ). I’m very interested in developing automated techniques for handling the massive and growing amounts of information that we all have to deal with. I started with e-mail and twitter, both of which are easy to access programmatically (via  IMAP  and the  Twitter API ).
 
In the talk, I went through several of the simple and successful e-mail management scripts that I’ve developed.

<p>Introduction: Identity Slippage, and what’s the weirdest thing you’ve been e-mailed by accident?    Posted:  January 26, 2012 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |    31  Comments »    
I have an old, short, and concise gmail address (my first initial and last name at gmail.com). There are many other hmasons in the world who have since signed up for gmail, with variations on the “hmason” theme. Every so often, they mistype the address, or someone mishears it. I now receive between four and ten pieces of e-mail per week  meant for other hmasons . This was pretty amusing until someone opened an amazon account on that address (which I had to shut down). Poor Holly has never seen a single Citibank credit card statement (and Citibank won’t remove the e-mail address from the account when I call, since I’m not the account holder). Heidi hasn’t linked her Paypal account to her bank account, but I’m waiting for someone to send her money.

<p>Introduction: Autoscript Creates LSL Scripts Without Code    Posted:  September 2, 2007 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   second life  |    188  Comments »    
This week, I created  autoscript , a simple LSL script generator for  Second Life . The concept is to translate the way you think about interactive design – what should happen, and when – into functional code.
 
Scripting is one of the most creative parts of designing immersive spaces, and I hope this will make it accessible to more people. Please feel free to use this code however you like!
 
Writing a program like this requires a balance between simplicity and flexibility, and I’m erring on the side of the former. I do plan to add more functionality to it and would love your suggestions and ideas! Also, if you encounter anything that doesn’t work, please let me know in the comments here.

Welcome! I’ve gotten several hundred e-mails about my e-mail management code. I do want to share it as soon as possible. Here are the answers to the most common questions.
  Why separate scripts?  
My philosophy is based on the unix command-line tool model; Each script should be simple and useful alone, but when combined together they become extremely powerful.
  Why don’t we have the code yet?!  
I had no idea the talk would be shared beyond the couple hundred people in the audience or that it would be so popular! I started my position at  bit.ly  the same day I gave that IgniteNYC presentation, and I also have some  other   awesome   projects  that are competing for time.
 
I have to admit that the trained classifiers are all based on my personal data and were also trained mostly through tweaking in ipython.</p><p>2 0.82158589 <a title="43-lda-2" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-01-19-Startups%3A_How_to_Share_Data_with_Academics.html">85 hilary mason data-2013-01-19-Startups: How to Share Data with Academics</a></p>

This post assumes that you  want  to share data. If you’re not convinced, don’t worry — that’s next on my list.   
 
You and your academic colleagues will benefit from having at least a quick chat about the research questions they want to address. I’ve read every paper I’ve been able to find that uses bitly data and all of the ones that acquired the data without our assistance had serious flaws, generally based on incorrect assumptions about the data they had acquired (this, unfortunately, makes me question the validity of most research done on commercial social data without cooperation from the subject company).
 
The easiest way to share data is  through your own API . Set generous rate limits where possible. Most projects are not realtime and they can gather the data (or, more likely, have a grad</p><p>3 0.31570375 <a title="43-lda-3" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-07-05-Speaking%3A_Spend_at_least_1-3_of_the_time_practicing_the_talk.html">105 hilary mason data-2013-07-05-Speaking: Spend at least 1-3 of the time practicing the talk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Speaking: Spend at least 1/3 of the time practicing the talk    Posted:  July 5, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   speaking   |    3  Comments »    
 This week we welcome a guest contribution.  Matthew Trentacoste  is a recovering academic and a computer scientist at Adobe, where he writes software to make pretty pictures. He’s constantly curious, often about data, and cooks a lot. You can follow his exploits at  @mattttrent . 
 
In Hilary’s last post, she made the point that  your slides != your talk .  In a well-crafted talk, your message — in the form of the words you say — needs to dominate while the slides need to play a supporting role.  Speak the important parts, and use your slides as a backdrop for what you’re saying.
 
Hilary has provided a valuable strategy in her post, but how should someone approach crafting such a clearly-organized presentation?  If you’re just getting started speaking, it can be a real challenge to make a coherent talk and along with slid</p><p>4 0.3029139 <a title="43-lda-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-12-18-Using_Twitter%E2%80%99s_Lead-Gen_Card_to_Recruit_Beta_Testers.html">114 hilary mason data-2013-12-18-Using Twitter’s Lead-Gen Card to Recruit Beta Testers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Using Twitter’s Lead-Gen Card to Recruit Beta Testers    Posted:  December 18, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   email ,  hack ,  twitter  |    12  Comments »    
It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.
 
The tweet itself:
  
Love tech discussion but looking for a better community? Help me beta test a side project!  https://t.co/H3DYjbCy19

I created it pretty easily:
  
 First, go to  ads.twitter.com , log in, and go to “creatives”, then “cards”. 
 Click “Create Lead Generation Card”. It’s a big blue button. 
 You can include a title and a short description. Curiously, you can also include a 600px by 150px image.

<p>Introduction: Need actual random numbers? Meet the NIST randomness beacon.    Posted:  September 30, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   projects   |  Tags:   beacon ,  python ,  random ,  randomness ,  randomnumbers  |    5  Comments »    
I wrote a  python module  that wraps that  NIST Randomness Beacon , making it simple to get truly random numbers in python.
 
It’s easy to use:
  b = Beacon()
print b.last_record()
print b.previous_record()
#and so on  
There’s also a handy generator for getting a set of  n  random numbers.
 
(One of the best gifts I ever got was a copy of  1,000,000 Random Numbers , and I’ve been intrigued ever since.)
 
Please note that this the randomness beacon is not intended to be a source of cryptographic keys — indeed, it’s a public set of numbers, so I wouldn’t recommend doing anything that could be compromised by someone else having the access to the  exact same set of numbers . Rather, this is interesting precisely for the scientific opportunities that</p><p>6 0.28930983 <a title="43-lda-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-01-28-Startups%3A_Why_to_Share_Data_with_Academics.html">87 hilary mason data-2013-01-28-Startups: Why to Share Data with Academics</a></p>

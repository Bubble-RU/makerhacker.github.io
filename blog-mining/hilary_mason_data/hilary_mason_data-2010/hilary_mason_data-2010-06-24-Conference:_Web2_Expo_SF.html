I gave a talk called  A Data-driven Look at the Realtime Web Ecosystem  at the  Web2Expo SF  conference in May in San Francisco. I attempted to highlight some of the interesting facets of the bit.ly data set, and it appeared to be well-received (showing up on  TechCrunch ,  ZDNet , and a few other places).
 
I attended the full conference, and it was great. The attendees were extremely international and I met a ton of fascinating people.
 
I’m still getting a couple of e-mail requests per week for my slides and materials, so they’re posted below for posterity.

The first  Strata Conference in New York  just wound up. It was a five day expo of business, data, and tech, and brought a ton of great people in the data community to New York.

I gave a talk at BarCampNYC4 on Saturday on common data problems and a very light overview of algorithms that address them.

You can  catch an interview  (or see a  writeup ) that I did live from the  Strata Conference  on Silicon Angle TV! We talk about bit.ly data, politics, and touch briefly on some of the interesting problems that we’re working on.

 This week we welcome a guest contribution.  Matthew Trentacoste  is a recovering academic and a computer scientist at Adobe, where he writes software to make pretty pictures. He’s constantly curious, often about data, and cooks a lot. You can follow his exploits at  @mattttrent . 
 
In Hilary’s last post, she made the point that  your slides != your talk .  In a well-crafted talk, your message — in the form of the words you say — needs to dominate while the slides need to play a supporting role.  Speak the important parts, and use your slides as a backdrop for what you’re saying.
 
Hilary has provided a valuable strategy in her post, but how should someone approach crafting such a clearly-organized presentation?  If you’re just getting started speaking, it can be a real challenge to make a coherent talk and along with slid</p><p>6 0.11649574 <a title="44-tfidf-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-01-08-Bitly_Social_Data_APIs.html">82 hilary mason data-2013-01-08-Bitly Social Data APIs</a></p>

I gave a talk called  A Data-driven Look at the Realtime Web Ecosystem  at the  Web2Expo SF  conference in May in San Francisco. I attempted to highlight some of the interesting facets of the bit.ly data set, and it appeared to be well-received (showing up on  TechCrunch ,  ZDNet , and a few other places).
 
I attended the full conference, and it was great. The attendees were extremely international and I met a ton of fascinating people.
 
I’m still getting a couple of e-mail requests per week for my slides and materials, so they’re posted below for posterity.

I’m honored and excited to be participating in Rhizome’s new conference  Seven on Seven , where technologists and artists are paired up to create a completely new project in 24-hours.
 
The formal description:
  
Seven on Seven will pair seven leading artists with seven game-changing technologists in teams of two, and challenge them to develop something new –be it an application, social media, artwork, product, or whatever they imagine– over the course of a single day. The seven teams will unveil their ideas at a one-day event at the New Museum on April 17th.
  
I really love this idea because the time constraints and the inherent discomfort of the situation (working in an unfamiliar space with an unfamiliar person) makes it likely that we’ll be able to accomplish something creative and unexpected.

I recently attended the  Third Annual Workshop on Search and Social Media , an academic workshop with very strong industry participation. The workshop was packed, and had some of the most informative and interesting panel discussions I’ve seen (not counting the one I spoke on!).
 
 Daniel Tunkelang  did a great job of writing up the specific presentations on his site and  on the ACM blog , so I won’t attempt to re-create the presentations line by line at this late date. Rather, I’d like to highlight a few open problems and research questions that came out of the discussions that I hope to see developed in the next year.

It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.
 
The tweet itself:
  
Love tech discussion but looking for a better community? Help me beta test a side project!  https://t.co/H3DYjbCy19

I created it pretty easily:
  
 First, go to  ads.twitter.com , log in, and go to “creatives”, then “cards”. 
 Click “Create Lead Generation Card”. It’s a big blue button.

<p>Introduction: Startups: Why to Share Data with Academics    Posted:  January 28, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |    5  Comments »    
Last week I wrote a bit about  how to share data with academics . This is the complimentary piece, on  why  you should invest the time and energy in sharing your data with the academic community.
 
As I was talking to people about this topic it became clear that there are really two different questions people ask. First, why do this at all? And second, what do I tell my boss?
 
Let’s start with the second one. This is what you should tell your boss:
  
  Academic research based on our work is a great press opportunity and demonstrates that credible people outside of our company find our work interesting.  
 Having researchers work on our data is an easy way to access highly educated brainpower, for free, that in no way competes with us. Who knows what interesting stuff they’ll come up with?

This is a 2 hour and 43 minute instructional video that walks you through basic machine learning algorithms, first theoretically and mathematically, and then with Python example code (which is available  here ).
 
This video is an instructional take and builds on the material I covered in my  Strange Loop 2010  keynote  Machine Learning: A Love Story  and the  Data Bootcamp  I did with Joe Adler, Drew Conway, and Jake Hofman at  the  Strata Conference  in February.

I spoke at  devs love bacon  back in April on   Everything You Need to know about Machine Learning in 30 Minutes or Less  . The talk is geared toward engineers with no prior knowledge of machine learning, and it’s designed to lay out the basic vocabulary and way that we think about the world to provide an amusing foundation so that attendees will have a head start in investigating which techniques they might want to learn more about or implement. This talk is not an in-depth tutorial.

I gave the opening keynote this morning at  PyCon .
 
The one thing that everyone in the room at PyCon has in common is that we all  love  to code. I used that as the central theme of the talk, spoke about the constructs that give us joy, the history of some of our favorite patterns (they date as far back as the 60s!) and proposed that we think about the way we’ll compute fifty years into the future. There’s also a bit of fun data hacking, of course.

Great data scientists come from such diverse backgrounds that it can be difficult to get a sense of whether someone is up to the job in just a short interview. In addition to the technical questions, I find it useful to have a few questions that draw out the more creative and less discrete elements of a candidate’s personality. Here are a few of my favorite questions.
  
  What was the last thing that you made for fun? 

This is my favorite question by far — I want to work with the kind of people who don’t turn their brains off when they go home. It’s also a great way to learn what gets people excited.

 
  What’s your favorite algorithm? Can you explain it to me? 

I don’t know any data scientists who  haven’t  fallen in love with an algorithm, and I want to see both that enthusiasm and that the ca</p><p>6 0.1364678 <a title="49-tfidf-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2009/hilary_mason_data-2009-04-02-From_the_ACM%3A_Learning_More_About_Active_Learning.html">27 hilary mason data-2009-04-02-From the ACM: Learning More About Active Learning</a></p>

The April edition of Communications of the ACM has an interesting article on recent advances in active learning by Graeme Stemp-Morlock.
 
In  passive learning  (a more traditional approach), you build a large training set of classified data by (often) manually assigning labels. This data is used as the basis of your analysis. 
 
In the real world, we find that generating these large sets of labeled data is often expensive and time consuming. With  active learning , you identify the most ambiguous data to label, resulting in a much higher payoff for each label defined (and fewer headaches for your labelers).
 
The article goes on to mention that active learning is being used in practice with excellent results (for example in music identification, text classification, and even bioinfo</p><p>5 0.43627757 <a title="49-lsi-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-03-11-Conference%3A_PyCon_2011_Keynote%21.html">53 hilary mason data-2011-03-11-Conference: PyCon 2011 Keynote!</a></p>

The video from my keynote at  Strange Loop 2010  is up!

The original abstract:
  

Machine learning has come a long way in recent years — from a long-marginalized field so old it still has the word “machine” in the name, to the last, best hope for making sense of our massive flows of data.


The art of ‘data science’ is asking the right questions; the answers are generally trivial or impossible. This talk will focus more on questions than on answers. I’ll give a brief history of the field with a focus on the fundamental math and algorithmic tools that we use to address these kinds of problems, then walk through several descriptive and predictive scenarios.


Finally, I’ll show one example syst</p><p>2 0.25429675 <a title="49-lda-2" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-05-03-Speaking%3A_Explaining_Technical_Information_to_a_Mixed_Audience.html">102 hilary mason data-2013-05-03-Speaking: Explaining Technical Information to a Mixed Audience</a></p>

It’s a challenge to present deeply technical material to a room of people with varying expertise levels. If you leave it out, you’re abandoning the substance of your presentation. If you focus on it exclusively, you will lose most of the room.
 
Instead, include the material, but plan to repeat it two (or even three!) times.
 
The first time you explain it, explain it for the expert audience.
 
The second time you explain it, walk through an example of what the system enables.
 
If you’re audience is on Twitter, throw in a third version — the concise and tweetable one!
 
Let’s say we were giving a talk about a machine learning system to classify puppies.
 
Slide one would have a technical diagram of the architecture of the system, and you might explain it as: “We use a naive bayesian classi</p><p>3 0.24096307 <a title="49-lda-3" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-07-05-Speaking%3A_Spend_at_least_1-3_of_the_time_practicing_the_talk.html">105 hilary mason data-2013-07-05-Speaking: Spend at least 1-3 of the time practicing the talk</a></p>

 This week we welcome a guest contribution.  Matthew Trentacoste  is a recovering academic and a computer scientist at Adobe, where he writes software to make pretty pictures. He’s constantly curious, often about data, and cooks a lot. You can follow his exploits at  @mattttrent . 
 
In Hilary’s last post, she made the point that  your slides != your talk .  In a well-crafted talk, your message — in the form of the words you say — needs to dominate while the slides need to play a supporting role.  Speak the important parts, and use your slides as a backdrop for what you’re saying.
 
Hilary has provided a valuable strategy in her post, but how should someone approach crafting such a clearly-organized presentation?  If you’re just getting started speaking, it can be a real challenge to make a coherent talk and along with slid</p><p>4 0.23806775 <a title="49-lda-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2009/hilary_mason_data-2009-01-31-WordPress_tip%3A_Move_comments_from_one_post_to_another_post.html">24 hilary mason data-2009-01-31-WordPress tip: Move comments from one post to another post</a></p>
<p>Introduction: WordPress tip: Move comments from one post to another post    Posted:  January 31, 2009 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   tips ,  wordpress  |    3  Comments »    
I recently ended up with two posts on this site about the same project — one was a short summary, and the other a long, detailed article. I decided to consolidate them into the longer article, but I didn’t want to lose the six comments that had been posted to the short article.
 
I couldn’t find a way in the WordPress UI to move comments from one post to another, so I jumped into the database. If you run WordPress on a host, they probably provide a MySQL management tool like PHPMyAdmin, or you can log in with a mysql client.
 
First, find the table that contains the posts for your blog (the table name usually ends in  _posts ). Find the ID that matches the post you want to move comments  from , and the ID for the post that you want to move comments  to .
 
Note: An easy way to do this is to search by t</p><p>5 0.23046777 <a title="49-lda-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-12-18-Using_Twitter%E2%80%99s_Lead-Gen_Card_to_Recruit_Beta_Testers.html">114 hilary mason data-2013-12-18-Using Twitter’s Lead-Gen Card to Recruit Beta Testers</a></p>

It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.
 
The tweet itself:
  
Love tech discussion but looking for a better community? Help me beta test a side project!  https://t.co/H3DYjbCy19

I created it pretty easily:
  
 First, go to  ads.twitter.com , log in, and go to “creatives”, then “cards”. 
 Click “Create Lead Generation Card”. It’s a big blue button.

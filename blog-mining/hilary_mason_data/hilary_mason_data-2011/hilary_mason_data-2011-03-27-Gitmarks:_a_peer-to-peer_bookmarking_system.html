Several months ago I was looking for a command-line solution for group bookmark sharing. I couldn’t find one, so I coded up a quick python script that runs on top of git. It’s very much a hack that takes advantage of git to manage users, preserve the URL, the tags, the description of the URL (in the commit message) and also includes the content itself (so it’s grep-able later). If you put it on github, you get the additional commenting and collaboration features. You can check out my original code  here .
 
I’m very excited that  Far McKon  has picked up the project and has a great vision for where it can go. If you’re interested in hacking on it with him, let him know!

I get quite a few e-mail messages from very smart people who are looking to get started in data science. Here’s what I usually tell them:
 
The best way to get started in data science is to DO data science!
 
First, data scientists do three fundamentally different things:  math ,  code  (and engineer systems), and  communicate . Figure out which one of these you’re weakest at, and do a project that enhances your capabilities. Then figure out which one of these you’re best at, and pick a project which shows off your abilities.
 
Second, get to know other data scientists! If you’re in New York, try the  DataGotham events  list to find some meetups, and make sure to stay for the beers. Look for groups, like  DataKind , that need data skills put to work for good. No matter how much of a beginner</p><p>4 0.063550629 <a title="55-tfidf-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2008/hilary_mason_data-2008-03-08-Following_a_group_of_Twitterers_without_exhausting_SMS.html">16 hilary mason data-2008-03-08-Following a group of Twitterers without exhausting SMS</a></p>

I’m at SXSW, and I want an ability to see the latest Tweets from the group of Twitterers that I follow who are here in the area. I also have a limited number of text messages on my phone (1500, but still).
 
I coded up a quick app that allows you to great a group of twitterers and see their latest tweet on a mobile-friend page.  Check it out .

Over at  NYC Resistor , it was getting cold, and we needed a doorbell so visitors wouldn’t be stranded outside when the building was locked. A standard wireless model didn’t work reliably (the space is on the fifth floor, just out of range), so various members generally resorted to writing their phone numbers on a sign on the front door when they were expecting guests.

Several months ago, on a whim inspired by an off-hand comment from  Chris , I created a bot to bring the wonders of the  Unix bc language  to twitter.
 
 bc  is a command-line calculator that’s fast and has the capacity to do some fairly complex math.
 
Try it out on the command line:
  
echo '100 / 10' | bc -l
  
…Or by  sending a direct message to bc_l  (if you follow  bc_l  it will follow you back within a few hours).
 
I released the code under GPL, and it’s available on github:  http://github.com/hmason/tweetbc .
 
John Cook mentions the bot and makes some great observations in his post  three surprises with bc .</p><p>5 0.2849687 <a title="55-lsi-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2008/hilary_mason_data-2008-03-08-Following_a_group_of_Twitterers_without_exhausting_SMS.html">16 hilary mason data-2008-03-08-Following a group of Twitterers without exhausting SMS</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Gitmarks: a peer-to-peer bookmarking system    Posted:  March 27, 2011 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog ,  projects   |    3  Comments »    
Several months ago I was looking for a command-line solution for group bookmark sharing. I couldn’t find one, so I coded up a quick python script that runs on top of git. It’s very much a hack that takes advantage of git to manage users, preserve the URL, the tags, the description of the URL (in the commit message) and also includes the content itself (so it’s grep-able later). If you put it on github, you get the additional commenting and collaboration features. You can check out my original code  here .
 
I’m very excited that  Far McKon  has picked up the project and has a great vision for where it can go. If you’re interested in hacking on it with him, let him know!

    Google Now  is an extension to Google’s Android search app that uses all of the data that Google has about you along with what it can guess about your current context to present the information it thinks you need when it thinks you need it.
 
It’ll tell you to leave a bit early to make your next calendar event because of heavy traffic, or that it’s a friend’s birthday, or that there’s a cool cafe nearby where you are.
 
I think it’s amazing.
 
It’s amazing because this is the first Google product that takes ALL OF THE DATA that they have about us and actually makes it useful  for us . Not for advertisers.

It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.
 
The tweet itself:

I created it pretty easily:
  
 First, go to  ads.twitter.com , log in, and go to “creatives”, then “cards”. 
 Click “Create Lead Generation Card”. It’s a big blue button. 
 You can include a title and a short description. Curiously, you can also include a 600px by 150px image.

<p>Introduction: Startups: Why to Share Data with Academics    Posted:  January 28, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |    5  Comments »    
Last week I wrote a bit about  how to share data with academics . This is the complimentary piece, on  why  you should invest the time and energy in sharing your data with the academic community.
 
As I was talking to people about this topic it became clear that there are really two different questions people ask. First, why do this at all? And second, what do I tell my boss?
 
Let’s start with the second one. This is what you should tell your boss:
  
  Academic research based on our work is a great press opportunity and demonstrates that credible people outside of our company find our work interesting.  
 Having researchers work on our data is an easy way to access highly educated brainpower, for free, that in no way competes with us. Who knows what interesting stuff they’ll come up with?

<p>Introduction: Need actual random numbers? Meet the NIST randomness beacon.    Posted:  September 30, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   projects   |  Tags:   beacon ,  python ,  random ,  randomness ,  randomnumbers  |    5  Comments »    
I wrote a  python module  that wraps that  NIST Randomness Beacon , making it simple to get truly random numbers in python.
 
It’s easy to use:
  b = Beacon()
print b.last_record()
print b.previous_record()
#and so on  
There’s also a handy generator for getting a set of  n  random numbers.
 
(One of the best gifts I ever got was a copy of  1,000,000 Random Numbers , and I’ve been intrigued ever since.)
 
Please note that this the randomness beacon is not intended to be a source of cryptographic keys — indeed, it’s a public set of numbers, so I wouldn’t recommend doing anything that could be compromised by someone else having the access to the  exact same set of numbers . Rather, this is interesting precisely for the scientific opportunities that</p><p>6 0.14740118 <a title="55-lda-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-06-22-My_Head_is_Open_Source%21.html">58 hilary mason data-2011-06-22-My Head is Open Source!</a></p>

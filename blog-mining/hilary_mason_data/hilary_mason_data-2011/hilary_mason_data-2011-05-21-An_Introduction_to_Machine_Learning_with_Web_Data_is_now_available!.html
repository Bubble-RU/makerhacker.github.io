The art of ‘data science’ is asking the right questions; the answers are generally trivial or impossible. This talk will focus more on questions than on answers.

The talk is geared toward engineers with no prior knowledge of machine learning, and it’s designed to lay out the basic vocabulary and way that we think about the world to provide an amusing foundation so that attendees will have a head start in investigating which techniques they might want to learn more about or implement. This talk is not an in-depth tutorial.

The April edition of Communications of the ACM has an interesting article on recent advances in active learning by Graeme Stemp-Morlock.
 
In  passive learning  (a more traditional approach), you build a large training set of classified data by (often) manually assigning labels. This data is used as the basis of your analysis. 
 
In the real world, we find that generating these large sets of labeled data is often expensive and time consuming. With  active learning , you identify the most ambiguous data to label, resulting in a much higher payoff for each label defined (and fewer headaches for your labelers).

I’m really excited that  An Introduction to Machine Learning with Web Data  is now available for purchase!
 
This is a 2 hour and 43 minute instructional video that walks you through basic machine learning algorithms, first theoretically and mathematically, and then with Python example code (which is available  here ).
 
This video is an instructional take and builds on the material I covered in my  Strange Loop 2010  keynote  Machine Learning: A Love Story  and the  Data Bootcamp  I did with Joe Adler, Drew Conway, and Jake Hofman at  the  Strata Conference  in February.
 
I’d also like to acknowledge the many collaborators, colleagues, and friends who have made definite contributions to my thinking about this material and how best to pres</p><p>2 0.15940779 <a title="57-lda-2" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-07-05-Speaking%3A_Spend_at_least_1-3_of_the_time_practicing_the_talk.html">105 hilary mason data-2013-07-05-Speaking: Spend at least 1-3 of the time practicing the talk</a></p>

 This week we welcome a guest contribution.  Matthew Trentacoste  is a recovering academic and a computer scientist at Adobe, where he writes software to make pretty pictures. He’s constantly curious, often about data, and cooks a lot. You can follow his exploits at  @mattttrent . 
 
In Hilary’s last post, she made the point that  your slides != your talk .  In a well-crafted talk, your message — in the form of the words you say — needs to dominate while the slides need to play a supporting role.  Speak the important parts, and use your slides as a backdrop for what you’re saying.
 
Hilary has provided a valuable strategy in her post, but how should someone approach crafting such a clearly-organized presentation?  If you’re just getting started speaking, it can be a real challenge to make a coherent talk and along with slid</p><p>3 0.15524508 <a title="57-lda-3" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-09-25-Conference%3A_Strata_NY_2011.html">62 hilary mason data-2011-09-25-Conference: Strata NY 2011</a></p>

The first  Strata Conference in New York  just wound up. It was a five day expo of business, data, and tech, and brought a ton of great people in the data community to New York.
 
Thanks so much to Edd and Alistair and everyone whose hard work made this possible!
 
My talk, Short URLs, Big Data: Learning in Realtime is already online:
 
  
 
And the slides are up on Slideshare:

It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.
 
The tweet itself:
  
Love tech discussion but looking for a better community? Help me beta test a side project!  https://t.co/H3DYjbCy19

I created it pretty easily:
  
 First, go to  ads.twitter.com , log in, and go to “creatives”, then “cards”. 
 Click “Create Lead Generation Card”. It’s a big blue button.

<p>Introduction: Stop talking, start coding    Posted:  April 18, 2010 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog   |    65  Comments »    
I read  Out of the Loop in Silicon Valley  in the NYTimes today, which explores how and why women are under-repesented in tech startups. From the number of retweets I saw and the clicks through  bit.ly  links (12,579 at the time of this posting), it’s been getting a lot of attention.
 
There are some very strong, compelling themes in this article. Computer science and engineering to have an “image problem”; the way we teach math to elementary school students is horrible and turns way too many away.
 
I don’t want to nitpick the article, but there are a few statements that reinforce the very damaging stereotypes that the article sets out to dispel.
  

“When women take on the challenges of an engineering or computer science education in college, some studies suggest that they struggle against a distinct set of personal, psycho-social issues… Even women who soldier</p><p>6 0.14799578 <a title="57-lda-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2012/hilary_mason_data-2012-09-21-Help%2C_I%E2%80%99m_the_first_data_scientist_at_my_company%21.html">78 hilary mason data-2012-09-21-Help, I’m the first data scientist at my company!</a></p>

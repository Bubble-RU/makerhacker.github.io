I gave the opening keynote this morning at  PyCon .
 
The one thing that everyone in the room at PyCon has in common is that we all  love  to code. I used that as the central theme of the talk, spoke about the constructs that give us joy, the history of some of our favorite patterns (they date as far back as the 60s!) and proposed that we think about the way we’ll compute fifty years into the future. There’s also a bit of fun data hacking, of course.

The original abstract:
  

Machine learning has come a long way in recent years — from a long-marginalized field so old it still has the word “machine” in the name, to the last, best hope for making sense of our massive flows of data.


The art of ‘data science’ is asking the right questions; the answers are generally trivial or impossible. This talk will focus more on questions than on answers. I’ll give a brief history of the field with a focus on the fundamental math and algorithmic tools that we use to address these kinds of problems, then walk through several descriptive and predictive scenarios.

The first  Strata Conference in New York  just wound up. It was a five day expo of business, data, and tech, and brought a ton of great people in the data community to New York.
 
Thanks so much to Edd and Alistair and everyone whose hard work made this possible!

Your title should be both  vague  and  specific .
 
First,  vague . You generally have to commit to give a talk months in advance of the actual event. You do not, however, generally have a talk written several months ahead of the actual event. You may also have a particular talk accepted, and then arrive at the conference and realize that what you had planned isn’t ideal for that audience. A vague title offers you a lot of flexibility in altering the content of your talk as conditions change without betraying the expectations of the audience based on the materials published earlier.
 
And then,  specific . If your title is too vague (“Stuff and Junk”) people won’t be excited for your talk, and you’ll lack an audience entirely or won’t make it through the CFP process at all.

I gave a talk at the  NYC Python Meetup  on July 29 on  Practical Data Analysis in Python .

 
I tend to use my slides for visual representations of the concepts I’m discussing, so there’s a lot of content that was in the presentation that you unfortunately won’t see here.
 
The talk starts with the immense opportunities for knowledge derived from data. I spent some time showing data systems ‘in the wild’ along with the appropriate algorithmic vocabulary (for example,  amazon.com ‘s ‘books you might like’ feature is a  recommender system ).
 
Once we can describe the problems properly, we can look for tools, and Python has many!

<p>Introduction: Be Ballsy.    Posted:  March 18, 2011 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |    9  Comments »    
The things that are hardest to make yourself do are often the ones that end up being the most rewarding. 
 
(By rewarding I mean they lead to the kinds of experiences where you learn something new, get to meet amazing people, and generally have opportunities to do things you never would have imagined doing before. Rewarding does not only mean money.)
 
I was thinking about this at PyCon, after someone asked me how it felt, as a woman, to get up and give a technical talk to approximately 1,400 men. Five years ago I couldn’t have imagined myself doing something like that, but a series of small chances, risks, and experiences have led me here. And it was a ton of fun!
 
I thought about this again when Bryce sent me  a link to this post . OATV is hiring an analyst, and they haven’t received applications from women.

I gave the opening keynote this morning at  PyCon .
 
The one thing that everyone in the room at PyCon has in common is that we all  love  to code. I used that as the central theme of the talk, spoke about the constructs that give us joy, the history of some of our favorite patterns (they date as far back as the 60s!) and proposed that we think about the way we’ll compute fifty years into the future. There’s also a bit of fun data hacking, of course.

<p>Introduction: Speaking: Pick a Vague and Specific Title for Your Talk    Posted:  March 1, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   speaking   |  Tags:   presentations ,  speaking ,  title  |   Leave a comment »    
Your title should be both  vague  and  specific .
 
First,  vague . You generally have to commit to give a talk months in advance of the actual event. You do not, however, generally have a talk written several months ahead of the actual event. You may also have a particular talk accepted, and then arrive at the conference and realize that what you had planned isn’t ideal for that audience. A vague title offers you a lot of flexibility in altering the content of your talk as conditions change without betraying the expectations of the audience based on the materials published earlier.
 
And then,  specific . If your title is too vague (“Stuff and Junk”) people won’t be excited for your talk, and you’ll lack an audience entirely or won’t make it through the CFP process at all.

<p>Introduction: IgniteNYC: How to Replace Yourself with a Very Small Shell Script    Posted:  November 25, 2009 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog ,  Presentations   |  Tags:   email ,  ignitenyc ,  presentations ,  scripts  |    15  Comments »    
    I recently gave a talk at IgniteNYC on  How to Replace Yourself with a Very Small Shell Script .
 
The  Ignite  events are a fun blend of performance, technology, and speaking skill. Each presenter gives a five minute talk with twenty slides that auto-advance after 15 seconds.
 
The title of my talk is a classic geek reference (you can  get the t-shirt ). I’m very interested in developing automated techniques for handling the massive and growing amounts of information that we all have to deal with. I started with e-mail and twitter, both of which are easy to access programmatically (via  IMAP  and the  Twitter API ).
 
In the talk, I went through several of the simple and successful e-mail management scripts that I’ve developed.
 
I decided to</p><p>5 0.20723347 <a title="53-lda-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-07-05-Speaking%3A_Spend_at_least_1-3_of_the_time_practicing_the_talk.html">105 hilary mason data-2013-07-05-Speaking: Spend at least 1-3 of the time practicing the talk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Speaking: Spend at least 1/3 of the time practicing the talk    Posted:  July 5, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   speaking   |    3  Comments »    
 This week we welcome a guest contribution.  Matthew Trentacoste  is a recovering academic and a computer scientist at Adobe, where he writes software to make pretty pictures. He’s constantly curious, often about data, and cooks a lot. You can follow his exploits at  @mattttrent . 
 
In Hilary’s last post, she made the point that  your slides != your talk .  In a well-crafted talk, your message — in the form of the words you say — needs to dominate while the slides need to play a supporting role.  Speak the important parts, and use your slides as a backdrop for what you’re saying.
 
Hilary has provided a valuable strategy in her post, but how should someone approach crafting such a clearly-organized presentation?  If you’re just getting started speaking, it can be a real challenge to make a coherent talk and along with slid</p><p>6 0.19915515 <a title="53-lda-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2009/hilary_mason_data-2009-06-01-My_Barcamp_Presentation%3A_Have_Data%3F_What_Now%3F%21.html">30 hilary mason data-2009-06-01-My Barcamp Presentation: Have Data?

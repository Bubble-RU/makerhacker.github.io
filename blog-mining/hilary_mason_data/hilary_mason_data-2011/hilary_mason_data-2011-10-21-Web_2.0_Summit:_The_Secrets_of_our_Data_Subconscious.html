The first  Strata Conference in New York  just wound up. It was a five day expo of business, data, and tech, and brought a ton of great people in the data community to New York.
 
Thanks so much to Edd and Alistair and everyone whose hard work made this possible!

I gave a talk called  A Data-driven Look at the Realtime Web Ecosystem  at the  Web2Expo SF  conference in May in San Francisco. I attempted to highlight some of the interesting facets of the bit.ly data set, and it appeared to be well-received (showing up on  TechCrunch ,  ZDNet , and a few other places).
 
I attended the full conference, and it was great. The attendees were extremely international and I met a ton of fascinating people.
 
I’m still getting a couple of e-mail requests per week for my slides and materials, so they’re posted below for posterity.

I ended up at  NYC Resistor  on Sunday, and decided to experiment with physical visualization of some data. I grabbed the clicks per second on keyphrases including my name (“hilary mason”) over the last six months, aggregated them by day, and made this graph:
 
   
    
This is easy enough to construct for any phrase using the  clickrate data  that we’re calculating at  bitly . I exported it from matplotlib in svg, added a label, and used the laser-cutter to create this out of plywood:

I get quite a few e-mail messages from very smart people who are looking to get started in data science. Here’s what I usually tell them:
 
The best way to get started in data science is to DO data science!
 
First, data scientists do three fundamentally different things:  math ,  code  (and engineer systems), and  communicate . Figure out which one of these you’re weakest at, and do a project that enhances your capabilities. Then figure out which one of these you’re best at, and pick a project which shows off your abilities.
 
Second, get to know other data scientists! If you’re in New York, try the  DataGotham events  list to find some meetups, and make sure to stay for the beers. Look for groups, like  DataKind , that need data skills put to work for good. No matter how much of a beginner</p><p>6 0.080635712 <a title="66-tfidf-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2010/hilary_mason_data-2010-02-16-Conference%3A_Search_and_Social_Media_2010.html">40 hilary mason data-2010-02-16-Conference: Search and Social Media 2010</a></p>

The New York Times has a story this morning  on the growing use of mugshot data for, essentially, extortion . These sites scrape mugshots off of public records databases, use SEO techniques to rank highly in Google searches for people’s names, and then charge those featured in the image to have the pages removed. Many of the people featured were never even convicted of a crime.
 
What the mugshot story demonstrates but never says explicitly is that data is no longer just private or public, but often exists in an in-between state, where the public-ness of the data is a function of how much work is required to find it.
 
Let’s say you’re actually doing a background check on someone you are going on a date with (one of the use cases the operators of these sites claim is common).

I just got home from the  Web 2.0 Summit , a three-day conference that was packed with announcements, interesting ideas, and good conversations.
 
My short talk,  The Secrets of our Data Subconscious , touches on how the data we generate online interactions with the physical world spatially and through time, and on the relationships between the things we consume (in private) and the things we broadcast (in public).</p><p>2 0.92305654 <a title="66-lda-2" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-01-22-Introbot%3A_A_Script_to_Ease_the_Process_of_Writing_Introductory_E-mails.html">86 hilary mason data-2013-01-22-Introbot: A Script to Ease the Process of Writing Introductory E-mails</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Introbot: A Script to Ease the Process of Writing Introductory E-mails    Posted:  January 22, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   projects   |    1  Comment »    
The introductory e-mail is a message where I introduce two (or more) people who have yet to meet each other. It generally takes the highly structured form, “Salutation A and B! A does X. B does Y. You should meet for reason Z. Valediction.”
 
I almost always do opt-in intros, where I’ll write to each party separately and make sure it’s okay if I share their information, and explain why I think it’s worth their time. I find this approach to be more respectful of people’s privacy and busy schedules.
 
That means that by the time they get the formal introduction, they generally know what’s going on. Still, I find these messages peculiarly stressful.
 
Stressful task? Check. Highly-structured output? Check. Repeating the same information over and over? Check.  This calls for … a script!

<p>Introduction: Need actual random numbers? Meet the NIST randomness beacon.    Posted:  September 30, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   projects   |  Tags:   beacon ,  python ,  random ,  randomness ,  randomnumbers  |    5  Comments »    
I wrote a  python module  that wraps that  NIST Randomness Beacon , making it simple to get truly random numbers in python.
 
It’s easy to use:
  b = Beacon()
print b.last_record()
print b.previous_record()
#and so on  
There’s also a handy generator for getting a set of  n  random numbers.
 
(One of the best gifts I ever got was a copy of  1,000,000 Random Numbers , and I’ve been intrigued ever since.)
 
Please note that this the randomness beacon is not intended to be a source of cryptographic keys — indeed, it’s a public set of numbers, so I wouldn’t recommend doing anything that could be compromised by someone else having the access to the  exact same set of numbers . Rather, this is interesting precisely for the scientific opportunities that</p><p>4 0.26995501 <a title="66-lda-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-01-28-Startups%3A_Why_to_Share_Data_with_Academics.html">87 hilary mason data-2013-01-28-Startups: Why to Share Data with Academics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Startups: Why to Share Data with Academics    Posted:  January 28, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |    5  Comments »    
Last week I wrote a bit about  how to share data with academics . This is the complimentary piece, on  why  you should invest the time and energy in sharing your data with the academic community.
 
As I was talking to people about this topic it became clear that there are really two different questions people ask. First, why do this at all? And second, what do I tell my boss?
 
Let’s start with the second one. This is what you should tell your boss:
  
  Academic research based on our work is a great press opportunity and demonstrates that credible people outside of our company find our work interesting.  
 Having researchers work on our data is an easy way to access highly educated brainpower, for free, that in no way competes with us. Who knows what interesting stuff they’ll come up with?

It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.
 
The tweet itself:
  
Love tech discussion but looking for a better community? Help me beta test a side project!  https://t.co/H3DYjbCy19

I created it pretty easily:
  
 First, go to  ads.twitter.com , log in, and go to “creatives”, then “cards”. 
 Click “Create Lead Generation Card”. It’s a big blue button.

I spent a few minutes this week putting together a  quick script to pull data  from the  Locu API . Locu has done the hard work of gathering and parsing menus from around the US and has a lot of interesting data (and a  good data team ).
 
The API is easy to query by menu item (like “cheeseburger”,  my favorite ) and by running my little script I quickly had data for the prices of cheeseburgers in my set of zip codes (the 100 most populated metro areas in the US).

 New York is infinite. 
 
A human can only explore a place at a particular speed. The rate of change in New York exceeds the rate at which a person can possibly experience the city, and so it is impossible to run out of city to experience.
 
 New York is a neighborhood. 
 
At the same time, New York is a mosaic of wonderful little neighborhoods. What many visitors miss and all residents know is that you rarely have to walk more than a few blocks from home for any of life’s essentials, and enough people do the same that you find yourself saying hello.
 
 New York is chaotic. 
 
You are never the weirdest thing you see. The city will give you things to think about, and more. It is never boring, and you cannot take it for granted.
 
 New York is opportunity. 
 
Everyone comes through New York, eventually.

Great data scientists come from such diverse backgrounds that it can be difficult to get a sense of whether someone is up to the job in just a short interview. In addition to the technical questions, I find it useful to have a few questions that draw out the more creative and less discrete elements of a candidate’s personality. Here are a few of my favorite questions.
  
  What was the last thing that you made for fun? 

This is my favorite question by far — I want to work with the kind of people who don’t turn their brains off when they go home. It’s also a great way to learn what gets people excited.

 
  What’s your favorite algorithm? Can you explain it to me? 

I don’t know any data scientists who  haven’t  fallen in love with an algorithm, and I want to see both that enthusiasm and that the ca</p><p>5 0.046650458 <a title="63-tfidf-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2010/hilary_mason_data-2010-05-27-E-mail_automation%2C_questions_and_answers.html">43 hilary mason data-2010-05-27-E-mail automation, questions and answers</a></p>

Welcome! I’ve gotten several hundred e-mails about my e-mail management code. I do want to share it as soon as possible. Here are the answers to the most common questions.
  Why separate scripts?  
My philosophy is based on the unix command-line tool model; Each script should be simple and useful alone, but when combined together they become extremely powerful.
  Why don’t we have the code yet?!  
I had no idea the talk would be shared beyond the couple hundred people in the audience or that it would be so popular! I started my position at  bit.ly  the same day I gave that IgniteNYC presentation, and I also have some  other   awesome   projects  that are competing for time.
 
I have to admit that the trained classifiers are all based on my personal data and were also trained mostly through tweaking in ipython.</p><p>6 0.0449536 <a title="63-tfidf-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2007/hilary_mason_data-2007-06-11-Teaching_Search_Techniques_with_Google_Games.html">4 hilary mason data-2007-06-11-Teaching Search Techniques with Google Games</a></p>

I’m honored and excited to be participating in Rhizome’s new conference  Seven on Seven , where technologists and artists are paired up to create a completely new project in 24-hours.
 
The formal description:
  
Seven on Seven will pair seven leading artists with seven game-changing technologists in teams of two, and challenge them to develop something new –be it an application, social media, artwork, product, or whatever they imagine– over the course of a single day. The seven teams will unveil their ideas at a one-day event at the New Museum on April 17th.
  
I really love this idea because the time constraints and the inherent discomfort of the situation (working in an unfamiliar space with an unfamiliar person) makes it likely that we’ll be able to accomplish something creative and unexpected.

I recently had a tweet that’s caused a  bit  of  comment , and I wanted to expand on the point.
  
Everyone does realize that it's not about teaching people to CODE as much as it is about teaching people to THINK … right?

I’m a huge fan of the movement to teach people, especially kids, to code. 
 
When you learn to code, you’re learning to think precisely and analytically about a quirky world. It doesn’t really matter which particular technology you learn, as long as you are learning to solve the underlying logical problems. If a student becomes a professional engineer, their programming ability will rise above the details of the language, anyway. And if they don’t, they will have learned to reason logically, a skill that’s invaluable no matt</p><p>5 0.24251571 <a title="63-lsi-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-01-08-Bitly_Social_Data_APIs.html">82 hilary mason data-2013-01-08-Bitly Social Data APIs</a></p>

We just released a bunch of  social data analysis APIs  over at  bitly . I’m really excited about this, as it’s offering developers the power to use social data in a way that hasn’t been available before. There are three types of endpoints and each one is awesome for a different reason.
 
First, we share the analysis that we do at the link level. Every developer using data from the web has the same set of problems — what are the topics of those URLs? What are their keywords? Why should you rebuild this infrastructure when we’ve done it already? We’ve also added in a few bits of bitly magic — for example, you can use the  /v3/link/location  endpoint to see where in the world  people are consuming that information from .
 
Second, we’ve opened up access to a realtime search engine. That’s an actual search engine that retu</p><p>6 0.22453974 <a title="63-lsi-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2012/hilary_mason_data-2012-08-19-Why_I_love_New_York_City.html">74 hilary mason data-2012-08-19-Why I love New York City</a></p>

The wonderful folks at  LucidWorks  have posted the video of my recent  Lucene Revolution  keynote.
 
The brief idea behind this talk is that search is not a solved problem — there is still a big opportunity for building search (and finding?) capabilities for the kinds of questions that the current product fail to solve. For example, why do search engines just return a list of sorted URLs, but give me no information about the themes that are consistent across them?
 
The audience was technical, specifically Lucene and Solr devs, so I spent some time talking about how we use those technologies at bitly.</p><p>2 0.94022399 <a title="63-lda-2" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-08-24-bash%3A_get_http_response_codes_for_a_list_of_URLs.html">61 hilary mason data-2011-08-24-bash: get http response codes for a list of URLs</a></p>

I had a file with a list of URLs, and I wanted to grab the HTTP response codes for each of them. I’m sure this quick bash script isn’t the best way to do it, but it works, and I’ll probably want to do this again someday, so here it is!

 Food+Tech Connect  is putting together a fun series of essays where technologists and foodies share their opinions on how to hack to the food system.
 
They also had a great party, with liquid nitrogen ice cream and other very cool foods.
 
I’m honored to have been asked to participate, especially since food and tech are two of my favorite things! I decided to write about a hack that I did about three years ago, where I wrote a parser and built a statistical model of chocolate chip cookie recipes that I crawled off of the web.
  
I’d like to tell you the story of the Ultimate Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe.


This isn’t the Neiman Marcus $65,000 cookie recipe. Nor is it the classic Toll House Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe that we all grew up with (and, though th</p><p>4 0.22686911 <a title="63-lda-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2010/hilary_mason_data-2010-07-26-A_quick_twitter_bot%2C_%40bc_l.html">45 hilary mason data-2010-07-26-A quick twitter bot, @bc l</a></p>

Several months ago, on a whim inspired by an off-hand comment from  Chris , I created a bot to bring the wonders of the  Unix bc language  to twitter.
 
 bc  is a command-line calculator that’s fast and has the capacity to do some fairly complex math.
 
Try it out on the command line:
  
echo '100 / 10' | bc -l
  
…Or by  sending a direct message to bc_l  (if you follow  bc_l  it will follow you back within a few hours).
 
I released the code under GPL, and it’s available on github:  http://github.com/hmason/tweetbc .
 
John Cook mentions the bot and makes some great observations in his post  three surprises with bc .</p><p>5 0.21916354 <a title="63-lda-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-12-18-Using_Twitter%E2%80%99s_Lead-Gen_Card_to_Recruit_Beta_Testers.html">114 hilary mason data-2013-12-18-Using Twitter’s Lead-Gen Card to Recruit Beta Testers</a></p>

It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.
 
The tweet itself:
  
Love tech discussion but looking for a better community? Help me beta test a side project!  https://t.co/H3DYjbCy19

I created it pretty easily:
  
 First, go to  ads.twitter.com , log in, and go to “creatives”, then “cards”. 
 Click “Create Lead Generation Card”. It’s a big blue button.

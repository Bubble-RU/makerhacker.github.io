<p>Introduction: Books Recommendations for Programming Excellence    Posted:  November 1, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |    15  Comments »    
Yesterday I asked people on twitter for recommendations for things to read to improve as a programmer. I’m looking mainly for things on the philosophy side of software engineering. I do realize that practice is the most important thing, but sometimes you run into a design question and it’s always helpful to realize that very smart people have, indeed, thought about these things before.
 
I assembled the book recommendations into a  bitly bundle . I’ve only read a few of these (generally the older books) and so I can’t recommend specifics, but if you’d care to take a look  here they are !

 New York is infinite. 
 
A human can only explore a place at a particular speed. The rate of change in New York exceeds the rate at which a person can possibly experience the city, and so it is impossible to run out of city to experience.
 
 New York is a neighborhood. 
 
At the same time, New York is a mosaic of wonderful little neighborhoods. What many visitors miss and all residents know is that you rarely have to walk more than a few blocks from home for any of life’s essentials, and enough people do the same that you find yourself saying hello.
 
 New York is chaotic. 
 
You are never the weirdest thing you see. The city will give you things to think about, and more. It is never boring, and you cannot take it for granted.

I like to read. I love bookstores, I like to wander, and to find things that I didn’t know existed. But bookstores don’t have every book that exists. Amazon has most books, but search is a terrible way to discover new things. Amazon’s recommendations most likely maximize purchases, but are a terrible way to find something you didn’t know you were looking for (look at a book like  Effective JavaScript , for example, and you get recommendations for  Async JavaScript ,  Building Node Applications with MongoDB and Backbone ,  JavaScript Enlightenment ). Similarly, top 100 lists are great at showing you popular things that you’re probably more likely to buy, but not very good at helping you find a book with a story or idea that’s unlike anything you’ve read lately.
 
There must be a better way to explore books.

    Google Now  is an extension to Google’s Android search app that uses all of the data that Google has about you along with what it can guess about your current context to present the information it thinks you need when it thinks you need it.
 
It’ll tell you to leave a bit early to make your next calendar event because of heavy traffic, or that it’s a friend’s birthday, or that there’s a cool cafe nearby where you are.
 
I think it’s amazing.
 
It’s amazing because this is the first Google product that takes ALL OF THE DATA that they have about us and actually makes it useful  for us . Not for advertisers.

I just returned from the Second Life Community Convention in Chicago. I really appreciate all of the wonderful people that I had the chance to meet (or smeet) or just spend time with. There wasn’t nearly enough time for all of the conversations that I wanted to have!
 
There were a wide variety of presentations. We’ve come a long way since last year! The diversity of disciplines was astounding. I think the strongest work presented was in the sciences and medicine, and I was particularly impressed with the  Second Health  machinima.
 
Here are the slides from my presentation on Experiential Learning:
 
    
 
I’m hoping it inspires people to think about how we now have this capacity to create learning experiences that were simply never possible before. What do we do with it?

<p>Introduction: What do you read that changes the way you think?    Posted:  August 21, 2011 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   books ,  philosophy ,  reading  |    24  Comments »    
A friend asked me which of three startup business books she should read.  Obama’s reading list since entering office  has nothing surprising on it.
 
The most valuable books I read this year have been stories of things very different from what I spend most of my time thinking about.
 
One of my favorites was China Meiville’s  The City & The City , which I loved for the ambition and artistry, and another was Simon Winchester’s  The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary , which I loved for the descriptions of creating an analog, scalable information system.
 
What have you read recently that was really great?
 
 Edit:  Thanks for the recommendations! There are also a bunch over on  Google Plus .</p><p>2 0.99947876 <a title="60-lda-2" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-03-08-Speaking%3A_Title_Slides_%2B_Twitter_%3D_You_Win.html">94 hilary mason data-2013-03-08-Speaking: Title Slides + Twitter = You Win</a></p>

Your title slide should focus on the title of the talk. It should also include your name and affiliation, your logo if you have a cute one, possibly your blog or e-mail address if you want people to get in touch, and your twitter handle.
 
Here’s one of mine:
 
   
 
I usually mention that the beginning of the talk that if people have questions they can tweet them at me. This isn’t just because Twitter is a great way to get questions from people too shy to speak up (or who don’t get an opportunity). Here’s the hack: letting people know that you’ll be reading everything they say about your talk on Twitter makes them more likely to say nice things.
 
Further, in a multi-track conference, people who weren’t actually in your talk (or were there but not paying a lot of attention) will judge your</p><p>3 0.99901617 <a title="60-lda-3" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-02-18-One_Random_Tweet%2C_please..html">90 hilary mason data-2013-02-18-One Random Tweet, please.</a></p>

It’s easy to believe that other people use social networks in the same way that you do. Your friends largely  do  use them the same way, which gives us an even more biased perspective.

 
Unfortunately, most networks don’t provide a way to explore representative communications that you’re not connected to.
 
Well, now you can!  One random tweet , please.
 
 Update:  There were some slight technical difficulties due to hitting Twitter’s oembed rate limit. They should be repaired now.

There’s a method to this madness!)</p><p>4 0.99571252 <a title="60-lda-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2009/hilary_mason_data-2009-10-16-Data%3A_first_and_last_names_from_the_US_Census.html">34 hilary mason data-2009-10-16-Data: first and last names from the US Census</a></p>

I’ve found myself in need of a name distribution for a few projects recently, so I thought I would post it here so I won’t have to go looking for it again.
 
The data is available from the US Census Bureau (from 1990 census)  here , and I have it here in a friendly MySQL *.sql format (it will create the tables and insert the data). There are three tables: male first names, female first names, and surnames.
 
I’ve noted several issues in the data that are likely the result of typos, so make sure to do your own validation if your application requires it.
 
The format is simple:
  
 the name 
 frequency (percentage of people in the sampled population with that name) 
 cumulative frequency (as you read down the list, the percentage of total population covered) 
 rank

<p>Introduction: Speaking: Pick a Vague and Specific Title for Your Talk    Posted:  March 1, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   speaking   |  Tags:   presentations ,  speaking ,  title  |   Leave a comment »    
Your title should be both  vague  and  specific .
 
First,  vague . You generally have to commit to give a talk months in advance of the actual event. You do not, however, generally have a talk written several months ahead of the actual event. You may also have a particular talk accepted, and then arrive at the conference and realize that what you had planned isn’t ideal for that audience. A vague title offers you a lot of flexibility in altering the content of your talk as conditions change without betraying the expectations of the audience based on the materials published earlier.
 
And then,  specific . If your title is too vague (“Stuff and Junk”) people won’t be excited for your talk, and you’ll lack an audience entirely or won’t make it through the CFP process at all.

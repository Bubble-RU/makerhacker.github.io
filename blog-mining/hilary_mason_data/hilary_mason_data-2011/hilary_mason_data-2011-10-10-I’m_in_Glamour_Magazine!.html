Your title slide should focus on the title of the talk. It should also include your name and affiliation, your logo if you have a cute one, possibly your blog or e-mail address if you want people to get in touch, and your twitter handle.
 
Here’s one of mine:
 
   
 
I usually mention that the beginning of the talk that if people have questions they can tweet them at me. This isn’t just because Twitter is a great way to get questions from people too shy to speak up (or who don’t get an opportunity). Here’s the hack: letting people know that you’ll be reading everything they say about your talk on Twitter makes them more likely to say nice things.
 
Further, in a multi-track conference, people who weren’t actually in your talk (or were there but not paying a lot of attention) will judge your</p><p>4 0.1074379 <a title="64-tfidf-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-11-22-Speaking%3A_Two_Questions_to_Ask_Before_You_Give_a_Talk.html">113 hilary mason data-2013-11-22-Speaking: Two Questions to Ask Before You Give a Talk</a></p>

If you’ve had a talk proposal accepted or been invited to speak at an event, you’ll usually get a chance to chat with the organizers before you show up to give your talk.
 
While you probably have a good idea of the topic of your talk (if you don’t, that’s a post for another day!), event organizers can be invaluable in helping you frame a talk that will succeed with their audience. They are on your side and they want you to do great, or they wouldn’t be hosting you at their event.
 
These are two questions that I always ask the organizers before I speak.
 
 Question 1: Who will be in the audience? 
 
Knowing the basic demographics of the audience is necessary to make sure you’re speaking at the right level and tuning the cultural references and humor for the room. I often speak to audiences o</p><p>5 0.097644337 <a title="64-tfidf-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2012/hilary_mason_data-2012-11-05-Where%E2%80%99s_the_API_that_can_tell_me_that_this_photo_contains_a_puppy_and_a_can_of_Coke%3F.html">79 hilary mason data-2012-11-05-Where’s the API that can tell me that this photo contains a puppy and a can of Coke?</a></p>

We’ve gotten very good at extracting and disambiguation entities from text data. You can license a  commodity system , and there are  API  and even  open source tools  that work fairly well.
 
However, a large percentage of content that people share is not primarily text (a back-of-the-envelope guess says around 18%), and we currently have very little automated insight into that content.
 
I know this is a very hard problem, but I’m continuously surprised by how few people seem to be working on it.

We’ve gotten very good at extracting and disambiguation entities from text data. You can license a  commodity system , and there are  API  and even  open source tools  that work fairly well.
 
However, a large percentage of content that people share is not primarily text (a back-of-the-envelope guess says around 18%), and we currently have very little automated insight into that content.
 
I know this is a very hard problem, but I’m continuously surprised by how few people seem to be working on it. Any ideas?</p><p>same-blog 2 0.95175588 <a title="64-lda-2" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-10-10-I%E2%80%99m_in_Glamour_Magazine%21.html">64 hilary mason data-2011-10-10-I’m in Glamour Magazine!</a></p>

This is probably the least likely thing you would expect to appear on this site, but it’s true! I appear in the November 2011 issue of Glamour alongside Jess Lee, Caterina Fake, and Stacy Brown-Philpot, in a story by Kara Swisher. There will also be a panel event tomorrow morning to talk about  the article .
 
I don’t usually speak publicly about the women in tech issue, for a variety of reasons, primarily: if I’m speaking about women in technology I am not speaking  about technology , it’s not a topic that I have much insight on, it ignores the other dimensions of the problem, and I would really rather work hard and be known as a great technologist than a great  woman  technologist.

<p>Introduction: Data: first and last names from the US Census    Posted:  October 16, 2009 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   data ,  dataset ,  mysql ,  sql  |    1  Comment »    
I’ve found myself in need of a name distribution for a few projects recently, so I thought I would post it here so I won’t have to go looking for it again.
 
The data is available from the US Census Bureau (from 1990 census)  here , and I have it here in a friendly MySQL *.sql format (it will create the tables and insert the data). There are three tables: male first names, female first names, and surnames.
 
I’ve noted several issues in the data that are likely the result of typos, so make sure to do your own validation if your application requires it.
 
The format is simple:
  
 the name 
 frequency (percentage of people in the sampled population with that name) 
 cumulative frequency (as you read down the list, the percentage of total population covered) 
 rank

<p>Introduction: One Random Tweet, please.    Posted:  February 18, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   projects   |    4  Comments »         One random tweet.
  
It’s easy to believe that other people use social networks in the same way that you do. Your friends largely  do  use them the same way, which gives us an even more biased perspective.

 
Unfortunately, most networks don’t provide a way to explore representative communications that you’re not connected to.
 
Well, now you can!  One random tweet , please.
 
 Update:  There were some slight technical difficulties due to hitting Twitter’s oembed rate limit. They should be repaired now.
  (Note: between this and  bookbookgoose.com  I’m on a bit of a random kick lately. There’s a method to this madness!)</p><p>5 0.30555749 <a title="64-lda-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-08-21-What_do_you_read_that_changes_the_way_you_think%3F.html">60 hilary mason data-2011-08-21-What do you read that changes the way you think?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What do you read that changes the way you think?    Posted:  August 21, 2011 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |  Tags:   books ,  philosophy ,  reading  |    24  Comments »    
A friend asked me which of three startup business books she should read.  Obama’s reading list since entering office  has nothing surprising on it.
 
The most valuable books I read this year have been stories of things very different from what I spend most of my time thinking about.
 
One of my favorites was China Meiville’s  The City & The City , which I loved for the ambition and artistry, and another was Simon Winchester’s  The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary , which I loved for the descriptions of creating an analog, scalable information system.
 
What have you read recently that was really great?
 
 Edit:  Thanks for the recommendations!

 Twitter  rocks. It’s useful for  all kinds of things , but especially for chronicling a live event as it happens, including the pre-event discussion and post-conference wrapup.
 
We’re very excited to be hosting  NewB Camp  here in Providence, RI on February 23rd. In preparation for the event,  Sara  created a  NewBCamp  Twitter account and I coded up this quick script to pull in all tweets related to the conference.
 
It examines all of your followers tweets for a particular phrase or tag, and then reposts those tweets containing the tag to its own timeline with the author’s name prepended. I’m running this as a cron job on my hosting account. You can see it in action  here .
 
This is a quick hack. It has a couple of issue that I’m aware of:

Your title slide should focus on the title of the talk. It should also include your name and affiliation, your logo if you have a cute one, possibly your blog or e-mail address if you want people to get in touch, and your twitter handle.
 
Here’s one of mine:
 
   
 
I usually mention that the beginning of the talk that if people have questions they can tweet them at me. This isn’t just because Twitter is a great way to get questions from people too shy to speak up (or who don’t get an opportunity). Here’s the hack: letting people know that you’ll be reading everything they say about your talk on Twitter makes them more likely to say nice things.
 
Further, in a multi-track conference, people who weren’t actually in your talk (or were there but not paying a lot of attention) will judge your</p><p>3 0.16113208 <a title="13-tfidf-3" href="../hilary_mason_data-2009/hilary_mason_data-2009-01-01-Twitter%3A_A_greasemonkey_script_to_show_who_follows_you.html">23 hilary mason data-2009-01-01-Twitter: A greasemonkey script to show who follows you</a></p>

A couple of days ago I saw  @skap5′s comment :
  
“Dear Twitter  Is it too much to ask to add a follower marker so I can know if someone is following me and not just if  I am following them?”
  
I think that Twitter could benefit from displaying more information on the home page, and this idea was easy enough to code up. It should save some time and make the Twitter homepage that much more useful.
 
 The script displays a tiny icon on top of the portrait of people who are following you back on your Twitter home page. It leaves your non-followers alone, though it would be easy enough to develop a version that puts silly mustaches on them.
 
This is only a first version, and I welcome your comments and suggestions.

I recently ended up with two posts on this site about the same project — one was a short summary, and the other a long, detailed article. I decided to consolidate them into the longer article, but I didn’t want to lose the six comments that had been posted to the short article.
 
I couldn’t find a way in the WordPress UI to move comments from one post to another, so I jumped into the database. If you run WordPress on a host, they probably provide a MySQL management tool like PHPMyAdmin, or you can log in with a mysql client.
 
First, find the table that contains the posts for your blog (the table name usually ends in  _posts ). Find the ID that matches the post you want to move comments  from , and the ID for the post that you want to move comments  to .

It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.

<p>Introduction: Experimenting With Physical Graphs    Posted:  February 4, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |    4  Comments »    
I ended up at  NYC Resistor  on Sunday, and decided to experiment with physical visualization of some data. I grabbed the clicks per second on keyphrases including my name (“hilary mason”) over the last six months, aggregated them by day, and made this graph:
 
   
    
This is easy enough to construct for any phrase using the  clickrate data  that we’re calculating at  bitly . I exported it from matplotlib in svg, added a label, and used the laser-cutter to create this out of plywood:
      laser-cut time series
     
…which will shortly be adorning my desk at work. This is very simple, but there’s a lot of fun to be had with the physical manifestation of patterns we see in large amount of ephemeral data.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.91754448 <a title="13-lda-2" href="../hilary_mason_data-2008/hilary_mason_data-2008-01-22-Create_a_group_Twitter_account.html">13 hilary mason data-2008-01-22-Create a group Twitter account</a></p>

 Twitter  rocks. It’s useful for  all kinds of things , but especially for chronicling a live event as it happens, including the pre-event discussion and post-conference wrapup.
 
We’re very excited to be hosting  NewB Camp  here in Providence, RI on February 23rd. In preparation for the event,  Sara  created a  NewBCamp  Twitter account and I coded up this quick script to pull in all tweets related to the conference.
 
It examines all of your followers tweets for a particular phrase or tag, and then reposts those tweets containing the tag to its own timeline with the author’s name prepended. I’m running this as a cron job on my hosting account. You can see it in action  here .
 
This is a quick hack. It has a couple of issue that I’m aware of:

<p>Introduction: Why YOU (an introverted nerd) Should Try Public Speaking    Posted:  February 22, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   speaking   |  Tags:   algorithms ,  hacks ,  public speaking  |    27  Comments »    
You should be speaking at conferences.
 
Not an extrovert? Great. Speaking is for introverts!
 
We go to conferences to meet people (and learn things from people and find opportunities… from people). Meeting people at events takes a lot of energy, especially if you don’t look like the average dude at a conference. You have to explain your story to every single person you talk to, listen to theirs, and try to see if you have overlapping interests. It’s inefficient and takes a lot of time.
 
By being a speaker, you can tell your story just once, to everyone, and the people who are excited about what you have to say will come find you. You will actually save energy if you get up on stage.
 
It’s a great hack.

I’ve found myself in need of a name distribution for a few projects recently, so I thought I would post it here so I won’t have to go looking for it again.
 
The data is available from the US Census Bureau (from 1990 census)  here , and I have it here in a friendly MySQL *.sql format (it will create the tables and insert the data). There are three tables: male first names, female first names, and surnames.
 
I’ve noted several issues in the data that are likely the result of typos, so make sure to do your own validation if your application requires it.
 
The format is simple:
  
 the name 
 frequency (percentage of people in the sampled population with that name) 
 cumulative frequency (as you read down the list, the percentage of total population covered) 
 rank

<p>Introduction: One Random Tweet, please.    Posted:  February 18, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   projects   |    4  Comments »         One random tweet.
  
It’s easy to believe that other people use social networks in the same way that you do. Your friends largely  do  use them the same way, which gives us an even more biased perspective.

 
Unfortunately, most networks don’t provide a way to explore representative communications that you’re not connected to.
 
Well, now you can!  One random tweet , please.
 
 Update:  There were some slight technical difficulties due to hitting Twitter’s oembed rate limit. They should be repaired now.
  (Note: between this and  bookbookgoose.com  I’m on a bit of a random kick lately. There’s a method to this madness!)</p><p>6 0.32447278 <a title="13-lda-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2009/hilary_mason_data-2009-01-31-WordPress_tip%3A_Move_comments_from_one_post_to_another_post.html">24 hilary mason data-2009-01-31-WordPress tip: Move comments from one post to another post</a></p>

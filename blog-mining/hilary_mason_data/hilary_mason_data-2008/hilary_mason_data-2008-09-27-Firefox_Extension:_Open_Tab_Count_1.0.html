     Open tab count extension in the status bar
 
  
How many tabs do you have open in your browser right now?
 
Did you have to count manually? Are you using Firefox? Try the  open tab count  extension!
 
I created this extension because I wanted to explore memory management in browser tabs, and I was curious about the Firefox extension architecture. I’m not quite as eager to explore memory hacks in Firefox now that Google Chrome is out and handles that issue natively, but I’m still using this extension to monitor my tab (over)usage.
 
The extension puts a small icon in the status bar alongside the number of open tabs. If more than one window is open, the extension shows the number of open tabs in the current window / the total number of open tabs.
 
Please let me know below if you have any comments!

A couple of days ago I saw  @skap5′s comment :
  
“Dear Twitter  Is it too much to ask to add a follower marker so I can know if someone is following me and not just if  I am following them?”
  
I think that Twitter could benefit from displaying more information on the home page, and this idea was easy enough to code up. It should save some time and make the Twitter homepage that much more useful.
 
 The script displays a tiny icon on top of the portrait of people who are following you back on your Twitter home page. It leaves your non-followers alone, though it would be easy enough to develop a version that puts silly mustaches on them.
 
This is only a first version, and I welcome your comments and suggestions.

    Google Now  is an extension to Google’s Android search app that uses all of the data that Google has about you along with what it can guess about your current context to present the information it thinks you need when it thinks you need it.
 
It’ll tell you to leave a bit early to make your next calendar event because of heavy traffic, or that it’s a friend’s birthday, or that there’s a cool cafe nearby where you are.
 
I think it’s amazing.
 
It’s amazing because this is the first Google product that takes ALL OF THE DATA that they have about us and actually makes it useful  for us . Not for advertisers.

One of the more popular objects that I created in Second Life is the News Stand. This charming device takes any query term and displays the two latest headlines from Yahoo! News. Clicking the news stand will load the top news story for the topic in a web browser.
 
I’ve gotten more requests to customize the script than I can possibly keep up with, so I’ve decided to release the code under a creative commons license. I hope you find it useful! Please let me know if you make improvements, so that I can link to them from here.
 
Unfortunately, parsing XML at all and RSS feeds in particular is extremely messy in LSL.

Please join us for DataGotham 2014! We’ll be hosting the conference Friday, Sep 26th at the  Broad Street Ballroom  in the financial district in New York City. We look forward to getting New York’s data community together and having a great time.
 
The  Call for Proposals  is now open, and  we want you to speak . Our speakers come from every industry and type of background where people use data, and the best talks are ones where you tell us your real experience with a data project. What problem were you trying to solve? What went wrong? What went right? How does the story end? Or did it?
 
If you think you might have a story to tell but aren’t sure,  drop me a note . I’m happy to help you frame a successful talk, and we welcome speakers at all levels of experience. Some of our most popular talks have been from first-time speakers!</p><p>5 0.11110103 <a title="22-lsi-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-09-26-Learn_to_Code%2C_Learn_to_Think.html">108 hilary mason data-2013-09-26-Learn to Code, Learn to Think</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Firefox Extension: Open Tab Count 1.0    Posted:  September 27, 2008 |  Author:   hilary  |  Filed under:   projects   |  Tags:   extension ,  firefox  |    12  Comments »     
     Open tab count extension in the status bar
 
  
How many tabs do you have open in your browser right now?
 
Did you have to count manually? Are you using Firefox? Try the  open tab count  extension!
 
I created this extension because I wanted to explore memory management in browser tabs, and I was curious about the Firefox extension architecture. I’m not quite as eager to explore memory hacks in Firefox now that Google Chrome is out and handles that issue natively, but I’m still using this extension to monitor my tab (over)usage.
 
The extension puts a small icon in the status bar alongside the number of open tabs. If more than one window is open, the extension shows the number of open tabs in the current window / the total number of open tabs.
 
Please let me know below if you have any comments!

It turns out that it’s pretty easy to co-opt Twitter’s Lead Generation card for anything where you want to gather a bunch of e-mail addresses from your Twitter community. I was looking for people willing to alpha test a little side project of mine, and it worked great and didn’t cost anything.
 
The tweet itself:

I created it pretty easily:
  
 First, go to  ads.twitter.com , log in, and go to “creatives”, then “cards”. 
 Click “Create Lead Generation Card”. It’s a big blue button.

<p>Introduction: Speaking: Spend at least 1/3 of the time practicing the talk    Posted:  July 5, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   speaking   |    3  Comments »    
 This week we welcome a guest contribution.  Matthew Trentacoste  is a recovering academic and a computer scientist at Adobe, where he writes software to make pretty pictures. He’s constantly curious, often about data, and cooks a lot. You can follow his exploits at  @mattttrent . 
 
In Hilary’s last post, she made the point that  your slides != your talk .  In a well-crafted talk, your message — in the form of the words you say — needs to dominate while the slides need to play a supporting role.  Speak the important parts, and use your slides as a backdrop for what you’re saying.
 
Hilary has provided a valuable strategy in her post, but how should someone approach crafting such a clearly-organized presentation?  If you’re just getting started speaking, it can be a real challenge to make a coherent talk and along with slid</p><p>4 0.12431806 <a title="22-lda-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-01-28-Startups%3A_Why_to_Share_Data_with_Academics.html">87 hilary mason data-2013-01-28-Startups: Why to Share Data with Academics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Startups: Why to Share Data with Academics    Posted:  January 28, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |    5  Comments »    
Last week I wrote a bit about  how to share data with academics . This is the complimentary piece, on  why  you should invest the time and energy in sharing your data with the academic community.
 
As I was talking to people about this topic it became clear that there are really two different questions people ask. First, why do this at all? And second, what do I tell my boss?
 
Let’s start with the second one. This is what you should tell your boss:
  
  Academic research based on our work is a great press opportunity and demonstrates that credible people outside of our company find our work interesting.  
 Having researchers work on our data is an easy way to access highly educated brainpower, for free, that in no way competes with us. Who knows what interesting stuff they’ll come up with?

<p>Introduction: Need actual random numbers? Meet the NIST randomness beacon.    Posted:  September 30, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   projects   |  Tags:   beacon ,  python ,  random ,  randomness ,  randomnumbers  |    5  Comments »    
I wrote a  python module  that wraps that  NIST Randomness Beacon , making it simple to get truly random numbers in python.
 
It’s easy to use:
  b = Beacon()
print b.last_record()
print b.previous_record()
#and so on  
There’s also a handy generator for getting a set of  n  random numbers.
 
(One of the best gifts I ever got was a copy of  1,000,000 Random Numbers , and I’ve been intrigued ever since.)
 
Please note that this the randomness beacon is not intended to be a source of cryptographic keys — indeed, it’s a public set of numbers, so I wouldn’t recommend doing anything that could be compromised by someone else having the access to the  exact same set of numbers . Rather, this is interesting precisely for the scientific opportunities that</p><p>6 0.11783473 <a title="22-lda-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2011/hilary_mason_data-2011-06-22-My_Head_is_Open_Source%21.html">58 hilary mason data-2011-06-22-My Head is Open Source!</a></p>

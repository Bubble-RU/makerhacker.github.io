My  research group  had some fun controlling SL with a Wii-mote a few weeks ago. It’s easier than you think! Several people have asked how we did it, so I hope these quick instructions might come in handy.
  
 Download, install, and run  DarwiinRemote . 
 Turn Bluetooth on on the Macbook. You can do this by opening the Bluetooth Preferences Pane (Apple menu, System Preferences and choose “Bluetooth” under Hardware) and clicking the big “Turn Bluetooth On” button. If Bluetooth is already on, you can skip this step! 
 Hold the Wii-mote in front of the Macbook and press buttons 1 and 2 simultaneously. The LEDs on the Wii-mote will flash. 
 As you move the Wii-mote, you’ll see your movement plotted on the screen, as you see below.

Hello, and welcome to everyone who found this site via Torley’s story on the  Second Life blog !
 
I lead the  Immersive Media Lab  at  J&W; University . Several of our projects have utilized Second Life, including  Virtual Morocco  (cultural exchange and tourism promotion for the country of Morocco) and  SLMetrics  (a study of behavior modeling in virtual environments).

I just returned from the Second Life Community Convention in Chicago. I really appreciate all of the wonderful people that I had the chance to meet (or smeet) or just spend time with. There wasn’t nearly enough time for all of the conversations that I wanted to have!
 
There were a wide variety of presentations. We’ve come a long way since last year! The diversity of disciplines was astounding. I think the strongest work presented was in the sciences and medicine, and I was particularly impressed with the  Second Health  machinima.
 
Here are the slides from my presentation on Experiential Learning:
 
    
 
I’m hoping it inspires people to think about how we now have this capacity to create learning experiences that were simply never possible before. What do we do with it? How do we measure it?</p><p>5 0.063023813 <a title="15-tfidf-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-01-28-Startups%3A_Why_to_Share_Data_with_Academics.html">87 hilary mason data-2013-01-28-Startups: Why to Share Data with Academics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Startups: Why to Share Data with Academics    Posted:  January 28, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   blog   |    5  Comments »    
Last week I wrote a bit about  how to share data with academics . This is the complimentary piece, on  why  you should invest the time and energy in sharing your data with the academic community.
 
As I was talking to people about this topic it became clear that there are really two different questions people ask. First, why do this at all? And second, what do I tell my boss?
 
Let’s start with the second one. This is what you should tell your boss:
  
  Academic research based on our work is a great press opportunity and demonstrates that credible people outside of our company find our work interesting.  
 Having researchers work on our data is an easy way to access highly educated brainpower, for free, that in no way competes with us. Who knows what interesting stuff they’ll come up with?

I don’t usually write about software, but this is an issue of general interest. When you uninstall a program, it often leaves behind little bits of itself. This cruft accumulates over time and, especially in Windows, can reduce the performance of your machine.
 
I recently stumbled on a pair of utilities that quickly and easily remove this cruft:  AppDelete  for OS X and  Revo Uninstaller  for Windows (XP and Vista).
 
   
 
AppDelete is exactly what you see in this screenshot. You drag a program’s icon onto the little wooden garbage pail from the Applications folder. It asks if you’re certain that you want to delete the program, and then removes it. I’ve been using it for several weeks, and it works great.
 
Revo Uninstaller is a bit more complicated, but it has many more features. When you load the program, it displays a list of all of you</p><p>5 0.27922291 <a title="15-lsi-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2008/hilary_mason_data-2008-03-08-Following_a_group_of_Twitterers_without_exhausting_SMS.html">16 hilary mason data-2008-03-08-Following a group of Twitterers without exhausting SMS</a></p>

I’m at SXSW, and I want an ability to see the latest Tweets from the group of Twitterers that I follow who are here in the area. I also have a limited number of text messages on my phone (1500, but still).
 
I coded up a quick app that allows you to great a group of twitterers and see their latest tweet on a mobile-friend page.  Check it out .

My  research group  had some fun controlling SL with a Wii-mote a few weeks ago. It’s easier than you think! Several people have asked how we did it, so I hope these quick instructions might come in handy.
  
 Download, install, and run  DarwiinRemote . 
 Turn Bluetooth on on the Macbook. You can do this by opening the Bluetooth Preferences Pane (Apple menu, System Preferences and choose “Bluetooth” under Hardware) and clicking the big “Turn Bluetooth On” button. If Bluetooth is already on, you can skip this step! 
 Hold the Wii-mote in front of the Macbook and press buttons 1 and 2 simultaneously. The LEDs on the Wii-mote will flash. 
 As you move the Wii-mote, you’ll see your movement plotted on the screen, as you see below.

You can  catch an interview  (or see a  writeup ) that I did live from the  Strata Conference  on Silicon Angle TV! We talk about bit.ly data, politics, and touch briefly on some of the interesting problems that we’re working on.

I’m teaching a basic web design course this term that covers design concepts,  XHTML , and  CSS . The students are from a variety of backgrounds – some have knowledge of HTML, some are non-majors or non-credit students looking to pick up a useful skill, and many are complete beginners who are required to take the course as part of their degree programs.
 
Only a few students knew what a wiki (distinct from  Wikipedia ) was before beginning this project. The students were given a month to make their contributions to  the wiki . They were each assigned primary responsibility for one page at random, but were graded both on the success of their page and their contributions to other pages.
 
43 students across two sections of the class participated in the project. Of those, five (or 11</p><p>4 0.82255578 <a title="15-lda-4" href="../hilary_mason_data-2012/hilary_mason_data-2012-03-17-Short_URLs%2C_Big_Fun%3A_I_spoke_at_dropbox%21.html">72 hilary mason data-2012-03-17-Short URLs, Big Fun: I spoke at dropbox!</a></p>

I was immensely privileged to participate in the first ever Teen Second Life College Fair. The event was on the  Eye4You Alliance  TSL island.  At least 18 institutions were represented (see some of the booths in the image to the left), and approximately 200 teens attended.
 
I gave a short presentation on my own educational experiences and the incredible possibilities for careers in technology, but my favorite part of the college fair was the casual conversations that took place outside of the sessions and in the booth area. We talked about everything from education in Europe vs the US to tagging to SL building and scripting to politics… you get the idea!
 
For educators and recruiters, this was a fantastic event for connecting with young people who are excited, passionate, and resourceful.

Hello, and welcome to everyone who found this site via Torley’s story on the  Second Life blog !
 
I lead the  Immersive Media Lab  at  J&W; University . Several of our projects have utilized Second Life, including  Virtual Morocco  (cultural exchange and tourism promotion for the country of Morocco) and  SLMetrics  (a study of behavior modeling in virtual environments).

I was immensely privileged to participate in the first ever Teen Second Life College Fair. The event was on the  Eye4You Alliance  TSL island.  At least 18 institutions were represented (see some of the booths in the image to the left), and approximately 200 teens attended.
 
I gave a short presentation on my own educational experiences and the incredible possibilities for careers in technology, but my favorite part of the college fair was the casual conversations that took place outside of the sessions and in the booth area. We talked about everything from education in Europe vs the US to tagging to SL building and scripting to politics… you get the idea!

I’m teaching a basic web design course this term that covers design concepts,  XHTML , and  CSS . The students are from a variety of backgrounds – some have knowledge of HTML, some are non-majors or non-credit students looking to pick up a useful skill, and many are complete beginners who are required to take the course as part of their degree programs.
 
Only a few students knew what a wiki (distinct from  Wikipedia ) was before beginning this project. The students were given a month to make their contributions to  the wiki . They were each assigned primary responsibility for one page at random, but were graded both on the success of their page and their contributions to other pages.
 
43 students across two sections of the class participated in the project.

 Food+Tech Connect  is putting together a fun series of essays where technologists and foodies share their opinions on how to hack to the food system.
 
They also had a great party, with liquid nitrogen ice cream and other very cool foods.
 
I’m honored to have been asked to participate, especially since food and tech are two of my favorite things! I decided to write about a hack that I did about three years ago, where I wrote a parser and built a statistical model of chocolate chip cookie recipes that I crawled off of the web.
  
I’d like to tell you the story of the Ultimate Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe.

The vendor containing this hat was recently deleted from Virtual Morocco by an employee of Linden Lab without any notification to me. Why? Because an anonymous person complained that it is “broadly offensive”.
 
 Virtual Morocco  was created to be both a tourism promotion platform and a space for cultural exchange. It was built entirely by undergraduate students as an educational service-learning project.
 
We give space in the Marrakesh Marketplace to several Moroccan artisans with virtual goods for sale. Our only requirements are that they keep everything appropriate to the sim’s theme and to the educational context of the space. The vendor selling the hat was owned by a college student (not from our institution) who specializes in items appropriate for the Morocco of the 1940s.

I was visiting my grandparents yesterday, and my grandfather asked for help e-mailing an article to some of his friends. I asked him to show me how he normally writes an e-mail, and taught him the magic of copy and paste (it  is  amazing if you haven’t seen it before) but I noticed that in the course of sending an e-mail and checking on his inbox, he clicked on this ad three times.
 
 
 
When I asked about it, he didn’t realize he had clicked the ad — he just thought these screens popped up randomly — because he didn’t realize that his hands were shaking on the trackpad.
 
I’m sure the data says that that’s the optimal place on the screen for the ad. I’m sure tons of people ‘click’ on it. I’m also sure it’s wrong, and it results in a terrible experience.
 
It’s common sense, but experiences</p><p>3 0.29601258 <a title="14-lda-3" href="../hilary_mason_data-2008/hilary_mason_data-2008-07-21-Welcome.html">20 hilary mason data-2008-07-21-Welcome</a></p>

Hello, and welcome to everyone who found this site via Torley’s story on the  Second Life blog !
 
I lead the  Immersive Media Lab  at  J&W; University . Several of our projects have utilized Second Life, including  Virtual Morocco  (cultural exchange and tourism promotion for the country of Morocco) and  SLMetrics  (a study of behavior modeling in virtual environments).
 
This isn’t a Second Life blog, but you will find LSL scripts and other related ephemera around.

The  Second Life Scripters  mailing list just had a great discussion on the cycle of the sun and the seasons in Second Life. As very detail-oriented residents may have already determined, the sun and moon in SL do not follow the Earth’s natural course.
 
Scripter Extraordinaire Zyzzy Zarf (who doesn’t seem to have a web site, but if I’m wrong, please let me know in the comments!) provided some code obtained from a Linden that indicates that the sun moves in a circle around a tilted plane. The angle of the plane rotates around each year.
 
This results in a “good enough” simulation o</p><p>5 0.11613659 <a title="14-lda-5" href="../hilary_mason_data-2013/hilary_mason_data-2013-07-05-Speaking%3A_Spend_at_least_1-3_of_the_time_practicing_the_talk.html">105 hilary mason data-2013-07-05-Speaking: Spend at least 1-3 of the time practicing the talk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Speaking: Spend at least 1/3 of the time practicing the talk    Posted:  July 5, 2013 |  Author:   Hilary Mason  |  Filed under:   speaking   |    3  Comments »    
 This week we welcome a guest contribution.  Matthew Trentacoste  is a recovering academic and a computer scientist at Adobe, where he writes software to make pretty pictures. He’s constantly curious, often about data, and cooks a lot. You can follow his exploits at  @mattttrent . 
 
In Hilary’s last post, she made the point that  your slides != your talk .  In a well-crafted talk, your message — in the form of the words you say — needs to dominate while the slides need to play a supporting role.  Speak the important parts, and use your slides as a backdrop for what you’re saying.
 
Hilary has provided a valuable strategy in her post, but how should someone approach crafting such a clearly-organized presentation?  If you’re just getting started speaking, it can be a real challenge to make a coherent talk and along with slid</p><p>6 0.11412489 <a title="14-lda-6" href="../hilary_mason_data-2009/hilary_mason_data-2009-02-28-LSL%3A_Newspaper_Stand_%28Pull_Data_From_an_API_and_Display_it_in_Second_Life%29.html">26 hilary mason data-2009-02-28-LSL: Newspaper Stand (Pull Data From an API and Display it in Second Life)</a></p>

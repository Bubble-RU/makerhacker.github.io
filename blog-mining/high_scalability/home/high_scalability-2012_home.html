<p>Introduction: A big part of engineering for a quality experience is bringing in the  long tail . An improbable severe failure can ruin your experience of a site, even if your average experience is quite good. That's where building for  resilience  comes in. Resiliency used to be outside the realm of possibility for the common system. It was simply too complex and too expensive.
 
An evolution has been underway, making 2013 possibly the first time resiliency is truly on the table as a standard part of system architectures. We are getting the clouds, we are getting the tools, and prices are almost low enough.
 
Even Netflix,  real leaders  in the resiliency architecture game, took some heat for relying completely on Amazon's ELB and not having a backup load balancing system, leading to a prolonged  Christmas Eve failure . Adrian Cockcroft, Cloud Architect at Netflix,  said they've investigated  creating their own load balancing service, but that "we try not to invest in undifferentiated heavy lifting.</p><p>2 <a title="high_scalability-2012-1378" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-28-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_December_28%2C_2012.html">high scalability-2012-12-28-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For December 28, 2012</a></p>

Eight years is a difficult prediction horizon. It's too short to simply project out current trends and it's too long to discount potential technological breakthroughs coming to market. There's the challenge.
 
Some of my lousy predictions: 
  
  Programmers Will Form Guilds Around New Gamified Training Hubs  
  The Web Will Become More Closed Before it Becomes More Open  
  Not Everyone Will Become a Programmer  
  Focus Will Shift to Creating Bigger People Instead of Chasing Big Ideas

<p>Introduction: Georeplication is one of the standard techniques for dealing when bad things--failure and latency--happen to good systems. The problem is always: how do you do that?  Murat Demirbas , Associate Professor at SUNY Buffalo, has a couple of really good posts that can help:  MDCC: Multi-Data Center Consistency  and  Making Geo-Replicated Systems Fast as Possible, Consistent when Necessary . 
 
In  MDCC: Multi-Data Center Consistency  Murat discusses a paper that says synchronous wide-area replication can be feasible. There's a quick and clear explanation of Paxos and various optimizations that is worth the price of admission. We find that strong consistency doesn't have to be lost across a WAN:
  

The good thing about using Paxos over the WAN is you /almost/ get the full CAP  (all three properties: consistency, availability, and partition-freedom). As we discussed earlier (Paxos taught), Paxos is CP, that is, in the presence of a partition, Paxos keeps consistency over availability. But, P</p><p>7 <a title="high_scalability-2012-1373" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-17-11_Uses_For_the_Humble_Presents_Queue%2C_er%2C_Message_Queue.html">high scalability-2012-12-17-11 Uses For the Humble Presents Queue, er, Message Queue</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a little known fact that Santa Clause was an early queue innovator. Faced with the problem of delivering a planet full of presents in one night, Santa, in his hacker's workshop, created a Present Distribution System using thousands of region based priority present queues for continuous delivery by the Rudolphs. Rudolphs? You didn't think there was only one Rudolph did you? Presents are delivered in parallel by a cluster of sleighs, each with redundant reindeer in a master-master configuration. Each Rudolph is a cluster leader and they coordinate work using an early and more magical version of the ZooKeeper protocol.
 
Programmers have followed Santa's lead and you can find a  message queue  in nearly every major architecture profile on  HighScalability . Historically they may have been introduced after a first generation architecture needed to scale up from their two tier system into something a little more capable (asynchronicity, work dispatch, load buffering, database offloadin</p><p>8 <a title="high_scalability-2012-1372" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-14-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_December_14%2C_2012.html">high scalability-2012-12-14-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For December 14, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We've long known one of the virtues of the cloud is, through the magic of services and automation, that systems can be shut or tuned down when not in use. What may be surprising is how much money can be saved. 
 
This aspect of cloudiness got a lot of pub at  AWS re:Invent  and is being rebranded under the term  Cost-Aware Architecture . An  interesting example  was given by Ryan Park, Pinterest’s technical operations lead:
  
 20% of their systems are shutdown after hours in response to traffic loads 
 Reserved instances are used for standard traffic  
 On-demand and spot instances are used to handle the elastic load throughout the day. When more servers are needed for an auto-scaled service,  spot requests are opened and on-demand instances are started at the same time. Most services are targeted to run at about 50% on-demand and 50% spot. 
 Watchdog processes continually check what's running. More instances are launched when needed and terminated when not needed.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by   Brian  Bulkowski  , CTO and co-founder of   Aerospike  , a leading clustered NoSQL  database, has worked in the area of high performance commodity systems  since 1989. 
   Why flash rules for databases     The economics of flash memory are staggering.    If you’re not using SSD, you are doing it wrong.   
   Not quite true, but close. Some small applications fit entirely in memory – less than 100GB – great for in-memory solutions. There’s a place for rotational drives (HDD) in massive streaming analytics and petabytes of data. But for the vast space between, flash has become the only sensible option.  
   For example, the Samsung 840 costs $180 for 250GB. The speed rating for this drive is rated by the manufacturer at 96,000 random 4K read IOPS, and 61,000 random 4K write IOPS. The Samsung 840 is not alone at this price performance. A 300GB Intel 320 is $450. An OCZ Vertex 4 256GB is $235, with the Intel being rated as slowest, but our internal testing showing</p><p>12 <a title="high_scalability-2012-1368" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-07-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_December_7%2C_2012.html">high scalability-2012-12-07-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For December 7, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: With cloud SLAs generally being worth what you don't pay for them, what can you do to protect yourself? Sean Hull in  AirBNB didn’t have to fail   has some solid advice on how to deal with outages:
  
  Use Redundancy . Make database and webserver tiers redundant using multi-az or alternately read-replicas.  
  Have a browsing only mode . Give users a read-only version of your site. Users may not even notice failures as they will only see problems when they need to perform a write operation. 
  Web Applications need Feature Flags . Build in the ability to turn off and on major parts of your site and flip the switch when problems arise. 
  Consider Netflix’s Simian . By randomly causing outages in your application you can continually test your failover and redundancy infrastructure. 
  Use multiple clouds . Use Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Clouds as a way of surviving outages in any one particular cloud. 
  
None of these are easy and it's worth considering that your application may</p><p>14 <a title="high_scalability-2012-1366" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-03-Resiliency_is_the_New_Normal_-_A_Deep_Look_at_What_It_Means_and_How_to_Build_It.html">high scalability-2012-12-03-Resiliency is the New Normal - A Deep Look at What It Means and How to Build It</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Perhaps it is because the whole world feels as if it’s riding on the edge of a jagged knife that the idea of   resilience    is becoming a dominant theme across so many domains. Resilience in beings first developed when cells evolved a way of    maintaining inner order    through homeostatic (stability through constancy) mechanisms. After homeostasis was mastered,    allostasis    (stability through change) developed as a way of responding to a dynamic world of challenge. In economics we have the idea of    Transition Towns   , which emphasizes developing local economies as a way of being resilient to global failures. In agriculture we have the idea of    permaculture   , building a permanent agriculture by embracing diversity, sustainability, perennial systems, avoiding monocultures, and using    edge thinking   . There are many more examples, including    psychological resilience    and the legendary    resilience of ecosystems   .

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Sachin Sinha , Founder of  Iqlect  and developer of  BangDB . 
 
The goal for the paper is to provide the performances data for following embedded databases under various scenarios for random operations such as write and read. The data is presented in graphical manner to make the data self explanatory to some extent.
  
  LevelDB :

LevelDB is a fast key-value storage library written at Google that provides an ordered mapping from string keys to string values. Leveldb is based on LSM (Log-Structured Merge-Tree) and uses SSTable and MemTable for the database implementation. It's written in C++ and availabe under BSD license. LevelDB treats key and value as arbitrary byte arrays and stores keys in ordered fashion. It uses snappy compression for the data compression. Write and Read are concurrent for the db, but write performs best with single thread whereas Read scales with number of cores

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Jon Vlachogiannis . Jon is the founder and CTO of  BugSense . 
 
 BugSense, is an error-reporting and quality metrics service that tracks thousand of apps every day. When mobile apps crash, BugSense helps developers pinpoint and fix the problem. The startup delivers first-class service to its customers, which include VMWare, Samsung, Skype and thousands of independent app developers. Tracking more than 200M devices requires fast, fault tolerant and cheap infrastructure.    The last six months, we’ve decided to use our BigData infrastructure, to provide the users with metrics about their apps performance and stability and let them know how the errors affect their user base and revenues.    We knew that our solution should be scalable from day one, because more than 4% of the smartphones out there, will start DDOSing us with data.    We wanted to be able to:

<p>Introduction: Other than  StackOverflow , PlentyOfFish is perhaps the most spectacular example of scale-up architectures working for what your average sane person would consider a large system. It doesn't hurt that it's also a sexy story. 
 
 Update 5 :  PlentyOfFish Update - 6 Billion Pageviews And 32 Billion Images A Month     Update 4 :  Jeff Atwood  costs out Markus' scale up approach against a scale out approach and finds scale up wanting. The discussion in the comments is as interesting as the article. My guess is Markus doesn't want to rewrite his software to work across a scale out cluster so even if it's more expensive scale up works better for his needs.   Update 3 :  POF now has 200 million images  and serves 10,000 images served per second. They'll be moving to a 250,000 IOPS RamSan to handle the load. Also upgraded to a core database machine with 512 GB of RAM, 32 CPU’s, SQLServer  2008 and Windows 2008.   Update 2 : This seems to be a  POF Peer1 love fest infomercial .

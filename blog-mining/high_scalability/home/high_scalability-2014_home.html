<p>Introduction: The introduction of cloud technologies is not a simple evolution of existing ones, but a real revolution.  Like all revolutions, it changes the points of views and redefines all the meanings. Nothing is as before.  This post wants to analyze some key words and concepts, usually used in traditional architectures, redefining them according the standpoint of the cloud.  Understanding the meaning of new words is crucial to grasp the essence of a pure cloud architecture. 
  << There is no greater impediment to the advancement of knowledge than the ambiguity of words. >>   THOMAS REID, Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man  
 Nowadays, it is required to challenge the limits of traditional architectures that go beyond the normal concepts of scalability and support millions of users (What's Up 500 Million) billions of transactions per day (Salesforce 1.3 billion), five 9s of availability (99.999 AOL).  I wish all of you the success of the examples cited above, but do not think that it is co</p><p>2 <a title="high_scalability-2014-1653" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-23-Gone_Fishin%27_2014.html">high scalability-2014-05-23-Gone Fishin' 2014</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Well, not exactly Fishin', but I'll be on a month long vacation starting today.
 
I won't be posting new content, so we'll all have a break. Disappointing, I know.
 
If you've ever wanted to write an article for HighScalability this would be a great time :-) I'd be very interested in your experiences with containers vs VMs if you have some thoughts on the subject.
 
So if the spirit moves you, please write something.

<p>Introduction: Arvid Norberg  on the  libtorrent blog  has put together an excellent list of  principles of high performance programs , obviously derived from hard won experience programming on bittorrent:
 
Two fundamental causes of performance problems:
  
  Memory Latency . A big performance problem on modern computers is the latency of SDRAM. The CPU waits idle for a read from memory to come back. 
  Context Switching . When a CPU switches context "the memory it will access is most likely unrelated to the memory the previous context was accessing. This often results in significant eviction of the previous cache, and  requires the switched-to context to load much of its data from RAM,  which is slow." 
  
Rules to help balance the forces of evil:
  
  Batch work . Avoid context switching by batching work. For example, there are vector versions of system calls like writev() and readv() that operate on more than one item per call. An implication is that you want to merge as many writes as possible.</p><p>4 <a title="high_scalability-2014-1651" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-20-It%27s_Networking._In_Space%21_Or_How_E.T._Will_Phone_Home..html">high scalability-2014-05-20-It's Networking. In Space! Or How E.T. Will Phone Home.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What will the version of the Internet that follows us to the stars look like? Yes, people are really thinking seriously about this sort of thing. Specifically the  InterPlanetary Networking Special Interest Group  (IPNSIG).
 
 
 
 Ansible-like  faster-than-light communication it isn't. There's no magical warp drive. Nor is a network of telepaths acting as a 'verse spanning telegraph system.
 
It's more mundane than that. And in many ways more interesting as it's sort of like the old Internet on steroids, the one that was based on on UUCP and dial-up connections, but over vastly longer distances and with much  longer delays :
  

The Interplanetary Internet (based on IPN, also called InterPlaNet) is a conceived computer network in space, consisting of a set of network nodes which can communicate with each other.[1][2] Communication would be greatly delayed by the great interplanetary distances, so the IPN needs a new set of protocols and technology that are tolerant to large delays and</p><p>5 <a title="high_scalability-2014-1650" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-19-A_Short_On_How_the_Wayback_Machine_Stores_More_Pages_than_Stars_in_the_Milky_Way.html">high scalability-2014-05-19-A Short On How the Wayback Machine Stores More Pages than Stars in the Milky Way</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How does the  Wayback Machine  work? Now with over  400 billion webpages indexed , allowing the Internet to be browsed all the way back to 1996, it's an even more compelling question. I've looked several times but I've never found a really good answer.
 
Here's some information from a thread on Hacker News. It starts with  mmagin , a former Archive employee:
  
 I can't speak to their current infrastructure (though more of it is open source now - http://archive-access.sourceforge.net/projects/wayback/ ), but as far as the wayback machine, there was no SQL database anywhere in it. 
  
 For the purposes of making the wayback machine go: 
 
 
 Archived data was in ARC file format (predecessor to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_ARChive) which is essentially a concatenation of separately gzipped records. That is, you can seek to a particular offset and start decompressing a record. Thus you could get at any archived web page with a triple (server, filename, file-offset) Thus it was spread</p><p>6 <a title="high_scalability-2014-1649" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-16-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_16th%2C_2014.html">high scalability-2014-05-16-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 16th, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: So how do you knit multiple datacenters and many thousands of phones and other clients into a single cooperating system?
 
Usually you don't. It's too hard. We see nascent attempts in services like Firebase and Parse. 
 
 SwiftCloud , as described in  SwiftCloud: Fault-Tolerant Geo-Replication Integrated all the Way to the Client Machine , goes two steps further, by leveraging Conflict free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), which means "data can be replicated at multiple sites and be updated independently with the guarantee that all replicas converge to the same value. In a cloud environment, this allows a user to access the data center closer to the user, thus optimizing the latency for all users."
 
While we don't see these kind of systems just yet, they are a strong candidate for how things will work in the future, efficiently using resources at every level while supporting huge numbers of cooperating users.

<p>Introduction: After Google  cut prices  on their Google Cloud Platform Amazon quickly followed with their own  price cuts . Even more interesting is what the future holds for pricing. The near future looks great. After that? We'll see.
 
Adrian Cockcroft highlights that Google thinks  prices should follow  Moore’s law, which means we should expect prices to halve every 18-24 months.
 
That's good news. Greater cost certainty means you can make much more aggressive build out plans. With the savings you can hire more people, handle more customers, and add those media rich features you thought you couldn't afford. Design is directly related to costs.
 
Without Google competing with Amazon there's little doubt the price reduction curve would be much less favorable.
 
As a late cloud entrant Google is now in a customer acquisition phase, so they are willing to pay for customers, which means lower prices are an acceptable cost of doing business. Profit and high margins are not the objective.

<p>Introduction: Our last article on Disqus:  How Disqus Went Realtime With 165K Messages Per Second And Less Than .2 Seconds Latency , was a little out of date, but the folks at Disqus have been busy implementing, not talking, so we don't know a lot about what they are doing now, but we do have a short update in  C1MM and NGINX  by John Watson and an article  Trying out this Go thing .
 
So Disqus has grown a bit:
  
 1.3 billion unique visitors 
 10 billion page views 
 500 million users engaged in discussions 
 3 million communities 
 25 million comments 
  
They are still all about realtime, but Go replaced Python in their Realtime system:
  
 Original Realtime backend was written in a pretty lightweight Python + gevent. 
 The realtime service is a hybrid of CPU intensive tasks + lots of network IO. Gevent was handling the network IO without an issue, but at higher contention, the CPU was choking everything. Switching over to Go removed that contention, which was the primary issue that was being se</p><p>12 <a title="high_scalability-2014-1643" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-06-The_Quest_for_Database_Scale%3A_the_1_M_TPS_challenge_-_Three_Design_Points_and_Five_common_Bottlenecks_to_avoid.html">high scalability-2014-05-06-The Quest for Database Scale: the 1 M TPS challenge - Three Design Points and Five common Bottlenecks to avoid</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This a guest post by  Rajkumar Iyer , a Member of Technical Staff at Aerospike. 
 
About a year ago, Aerospike embarked upon a quest to increase in-memory database performance - 1 Million TPS on a single inexpensive commodity server. NoSQL has the reputation of speed, and we saw great benefit from improving latency and throughput of cacheless architectures. At that time, we took a version of Aerospike delivering about 200K TPS, improved a few things - performance went to 500k TPS - and published the Aerospike 2.0 Community Edition. We then used kernel tuning techniques and published the  recipe  for how we achieved 1 M TPS on $5k of hardware.
  This year we continued the quest. Our goal was to achieve 1 Million database transactions per second per server; more than doubling previous performance. This compares to Cassandra’s boast of 1M TPS on over 300 servers in Google Compute Engine - at a cost of $2 million dollars per year. We  achieved this  without kernel tuning.

<p>Introduction: Famous computer scientist  John Backus , he's the B in BNF(Backus-Naur form) and the creator of Fortran, gave a Turing Award Lecture titled  Can programming be liberated from the von Neumann style?: a functional style and its algebra of programs , that has layed out a division in programming that lives long after it was published in 1977. 
 
It's the now familiar argument for why functional programming is superior:
  

The assignment statement is the von Neumann bottleneck of programming languages and keeps us thinking in word-at-a-time terms in much the same way the computer's bottleneck does.


...


The second world of conventional programming languages is the world of statements. The primary statement in that world is the assignment statement itself. All the other statements of the language exist in order to make it possible to perform a computation that must be based on this primitive construct: the assignment statement.

<p>Introduction: Adrian Singer has boiled down 7 years of experience to a set of 10 very useful tips on how to best  optimize NGINX and PHP-fpm for high traffic sites :
  
  Switch from TCP to UNIX domain sockets . When communicating to processes on the same machine UNIX sockets have better performance the TCP because there's less copying and fewer context switches. 
  Adjust Worker Processes . Set the worker_processes in your nginx.conf file to the number of cores your machine has and  increase the number of worker_connections. 
  Setup upstream load balancing . Multiple upstream backends on the same machine produce higher throughout than a single one. 
  Disable access log files . Log files on high traffic sites involve a lot of I/O that has to be synchronized across all threads. Can have a big impact. 
  Enable GZip .  
  Cache information about frequently accessed files .  
  Adjust client timeouts . 
  Adjust output buffers .

<p>Introduction: Here's an  Update On Disqus: It's Still About Realtime, But Go Demolishes Python . 
 
How do you add realtime functionality to a web scale application? That's what  Adam Hitchcock , a Software Engineer at Disqus talks about in an excellent talk:  Making DISQUS Realtime  ( slides ).
 
Disqus had to take their commenting system and add realtime capabilities to it. Not something that's easy to do when at the time of the talk (2013) they had had just hit a billion unique visitors a month.
 
What Disqus developed is a realtime commenting system called “realertime” that was tested to handle 1.5 million concurrently connected users, 45,000 new connections per second, 165,000 messages/second, with less than .2 seconds latency end-to-end.
 
The nature of a commenting system is that it is IO bound and has a high fanout, that is a comment comes in and must be sent out to a lot of readers. It's a problem very similar to what  Twitter must solve .

<p>Introduction: How is it possible that a wooden Shinto shrine built in the 7th century is still standing? The answer depends on how you answer this philosophical head scratcher: With nearly every cell in your body continually being replaced, are you still the same person?
 
The  Ise Grand Shrine  has been in continuous existence for over 1300 years because every twenty years an exact replica has been rebuilt on an adjacent footprint. The former temple is then dismantled.
 
Now that's resilience. If you want something to last make it a living part of a culture. It's not so much the building that is remade, what is rebuilt and passed down from generation to generation is the meme that the shrine is important and worth preserving. The rest is an unfolding of that imperative.
 
You can see echoes of this same process in Open Source projects like Linux and the libraries and frameworks that get themselves reconstructed in each new environment.

<p>Introduction: My favorite kind of histories are those told from an insider's perspective. The story of Richard the Lionheart is full of great battles and dynastic intrigue. The story of one of his soldiers, not so much. Yet the soldiers' story, as someone who has experienced the real consequences of decisions made and actions taken, is more revealing.
 
We get such a history in  Chat Wars , a wonderful article written by David Auerbach, who in 1998 worked at Microsoft on MSN Messenger Service, Microsoft’s instant messaging app (for a related story see  The Rise and Fall of AIM, the Breakthrough AOL Never Wanted ).
 
It's as if Herodotus visited Microsoft and wrote down his experiences. It has that same sort of conversational tone, insightful on-the-ground observations, and facts no outsider might ever believe.

<p>Introduction: There's a deep similarity between how long running systems like our brains and
computers accumulate errors and repair themselves. Reboot it. Isn't that the
common treatment for most computer ailments? And you may have noticed now that
your iPhone supports background processing it reboots a lot more often? Your
DVR, phone, computer, router, car, and an untold number of long running
computer systems all suffer from a nasty problem: over time they accumulate
flaws and die or go crazy.Now think about your brain. It's a long running
program running on very complex and error prone hardware. How does your brain
keep itself sane over time? The answer may be found in something we spend a
third of our lives doing. Sleep.There's new research out on how our brains are
cleansed during sleep that has some interesting parallels to how we keep long
running hardware-software systems up and running properly. This is a fun
topic. Let's explore it a little more.One of the most frustrating system tests

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ashwanth Fernando, Software Engineer from the trenches
at large scale internet companies.Inspired by the book "Effective Java" by
Joshua Bloch, I wanted to share my holistic recommendations on building high

<p>Introduction: This is an article published last year, but as today is Grace Hopper's
birthday I thought it would be a good time to share again an amazing talk from
this amazing woman.Computing pioneerGrace Hopper,inventor of the compiler,
searched for a concrete way to create an intuitive understanding of just how
fast is a nanosecond, a billionth of a second, which was the speed of their
new computer circuits. As an illustration she settled on the length of wire
that is as long as light can travel in one nanosecond. The length is a very
portable11.8 inches. A microseconds worth of wire is a still portable, but a
much bulkier 984 feet. In one millisecond light travels 186 miles, which only
Hercules could carry. In today's terms, at a3.06 GHz clock speed, there's .33
nanoseconds between ticks, or 3.73 inches of light travel.Understanding the
profligate ways of programmers, she suggests that every programmer wear a

<p>Introduction: Jeremy Edberg gave a talk on Scaling Reddit from 1 Million to 1 Billion-
Pitfalls and Lessons andone of the issuesthey had was that they:Did not
account for increased latency after moving to EC2. In the datacenter they had
submillisecond access between machines so it was possible to make a 1000 calls
to memache for one page load. Not so on EC2. Memcache access times increased
10x to a millisecond which made their old approach unusable. Fix was to batch
calls to memcache so a large number of gets are in one request.Dave Pacheco
had aninteresting questionabout batching requests and its impact on latency:I
was confused about the memcached problem after moving to the cloud. I
understand why network latency may have gone from submillisecond to
milliseconds, but how could you improve latency by batching requests?
Shouldn't that improve efficiency, not latency, at the possible expense of
latency (since some requests will wait on the client as they get batched)?
Jeremy cleared it up by saying:</p><p>13 <a title="high_scalability-2013-1557" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-02-Evolution_of_Bazaarvoice%E2%80%99s_Architecture_to_500M_Unique_Users_Per_Month.html">high scalability-2013-12-02-Evolution of Bazaarvoice’s Architecture to 500M Unique Users Per Month</a></p>

like bestbuy.com, nike.com, or walmart.com, you are using Bazaarvoice
services. These sites, along with thousands of others, rely on Bazaarvoice to

about products and services. All of this means that Bazaarvoice processes a
lot of sentiment data on most of the products we all use daily.Bazaarvoice
helps our clients make better products by using a combination of machine
learning and natural language processing to extract useful information and
user sentiments from the millions of free-text reviews that go through our
platform. This data gets boiled down into reports that clients can use to

<p>Introduction: Nettyis a high-performance NIO(New IO) client server framework for Java that
Twitter uses internally as a protocol agonostic RPC system. Twitterfound some
problemswith Netty 3's memory management for buffer allocations beacause it
generated a lot of garbage during operation. When you send as many messages as
Twitter it creates a lot of GC pressure and the simple act of zero filling
newly allocated buffers consumed 50% of memory bandwidth. Netty 4 fixes this
situation with:Short-lived event objects, methods on long-lived channel
objects are used to handle I/O events.Secialized buffer allocator that uses
pool which implementsbuddy memory allocationandslab allocation.The result:5
times less frequent GC pauses: 45.5 vs. 9.2 times/min5 times less garbage

the size of the buffer increases. Some problems with smaller buffers.Given how

<p>Introduction: In 1999 Dan Kegel issued a big hairy audacious challenge to web servers:It's
time for web servers to handle ten thousand clients simultaneously, don't you
think? After all, the web is a big place now.This became known as theC10K
problem. Engineers solved the C10K scalability problems by fixing OS kernels
and moving away from threaded servers like Apache to event-driven servers like
Nginx and Node.Today we are considering an even bigger goal, how to support10
Million Concurrent Connections, which requires even more radical techniques.No
similar challenge was issued for managing servers in a datacenter, but
according toDave Nearyfrom Red Hat, in a recentFLOSS Weekly episode, we have
passed the 10K barrier for server management with 10,000 or more servers
managed per sysadmin.Should we let this milestone pass without
mention?Absolutely not! It's a stunning accomplishment with 200x-2000x
increases in productivity. Dave said he remembered in the 1990s it took one

<p>Introduction: How do you keep a system small enough, while still being successful, that a
simple scale-up strategy becomes the preferred architecture?StackOverflow, for
example, could stick with a tool chain they were comfortable with because they
had a natural brake on how fast they could grow: there are only so many
programmers in the world. If this doesn't work for you, here's another natural
braking strategy to consider:charge for your service.Paul Houlesummarized this
nicely as:avoid scaling problems by building a service that's profitable at a
small scale.This interesting point, one I hadn't properly considered before,
was brought up by Maciej Ceglowski, co-founder ofPinboard.in, in an interview
with Leo Laporte and Amber MacArthur on their theirnet@nightshow.Pinboard is a
lean, mean, pay for bookmarking machine, a timely replacement for the nearly
departed Delicious. And as a self professed anti-social bookmarking site, it
emphasizes speed over socializing.

<p>Introduction: In 5 Lessons We've Learned Using AWS, Netflix's John Ciancutti says the best
way to avoid failure is to fail constantly. In the cloud it's expected
instances can fail at any time, so you always have to be prepared. In the real
world we prepare by running drills. Remember all those exciting fire drills?
It's not just fire drills of course. The military, football teams, fire
fighters, beach rescue, virtually any entity that must react quickly and
efficiently to disaster hones their responsiveness by running drills.Netflix
aggressively moves this strategy into the cloud by randomly failing servers
using a tool they built called Chaos Monkey. The idea is:If we aren't
constantly testing our ability to succeed despite failure, then it isn't
likely to work when it matters most - in the event of an unexpected
outage.They respond to failures bydegrading service, but they always
respond:If the recommendations system is down they'll show popular titles
instead.If the search system is slow then th</p><p>4 <a title="high_scalability-2010-963" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-23-Paper%3A_CRDTs%3A_Consistency_without_concurrency_control.html">high scalability-2010-12-23-Paper: CRDTs: Consistency without concurrency control</a></p>

data type whose operations commute when they are concurrent.From the
introduction, which also serves as a nice concise overview of distributed
consistency issues:Shared read-only data is easy to scale by using well-
understood replication techniques. However, sharing mutable data at a large
scale is a difficult problem, because of the CAP impossibility result [5]. Two
approaches dominate in practice. One ensures scalability by giving up
consistency guarantees, for instance using the Last-Writer-Wins (LWW) approach

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.Data storage has always been one of the most difficult problems
to address, especially as the quantity of stored data is constantly
increasing. This is not simply due to the growing numbers of people regularly
using the Internet, particularly with all the social networks, games and
gizmos now available. Companies are also amassing more and more meticulous
information relevant to their business, in order to optimize productivity and
ROI (Return On Investment). I find the positioning of SQL and NoSQL (Not Only
SQL) as opposites rather a shame: it's true that the marketing wave of NoSQL
has enabled the renewed promotion of a system that's been around for quite a
while, but which was only rarely considered in most cases, as after all,
everything could be fitted into the « good old SQL model ». The reverse trend
of wanting to make everything fit the NoSQL model is not very profitable
either.So, what'</p><p>7 <a title="high_scalability-2010-960" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-20-Netflix%3A_Use_Less_Chatty_Protocols_in_the_Cloud_-_Plus_26_Fixes.html">high scalability-2010-12-20-Netflix: Use Less Chatty Protocols in the Cloud - Plus 26 Fixes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In 5 Lessons We've Learned Using AWS, Netflix's John Ciancutti says one of the
big lessons they've learned is to create lesschatty protocols:In the Netflix
data centers, we have a high capacity, super fast, highly reliable network.
This has afforded us the luxury of designing around chatty APIs to remote
systems. AWS networking has more variable latency. We've had to be much more
structured about "over the wire" interactions, even as we've transitioned to a
more highly distributed architecture.There's not a lot of advice out there on
how to create protocols. Combine that with a rush to the cloud and you have a
perfect storm for chatty applications crushing application performance.
Netflix is far from the first to be surprised by the less than stellar
networks inside AWS. A chatty protocol is one where a client makes a series of
requests to a server and the client must wait on each reply before sending the
next request. On a LAN this can work great. LAN's are typically fast, wide,

<p>Introduction: It's time to do something a little different and for me that doesn't mean
cutting off my hair and joining a monastery, nor does it mean buying a cherry
red convertible (yet), it means doing a webinar!On December 14th, 2:00 PM -

<p>Introduction: I think I have been lucky that several of the projects I been worked on have
exposed me to having to manage large volumes of data. The largest dataset was
probably at MailChannels, though Livedoor.com also had some sizeable data for
their books store and department store. Most of the pain with Livedoor's data
was from it being in Japanese. Other than that, it was pretty static. This was
similar to the data I worked with at the BBC. You would be surprised at how
much data can be involved with a single episode of a TV show. With any in-
house generated data the update size and frequency is much less dramatic, even
if the data is being regularly pumped in from 3rd parties.Those HumansThe real
fun comes when the public (that's you guys) are generating data to be pumped
into the system. MailChannels' work with email, which is human generated
(lies! 95% is actually from spambots). Humans are unpredictable. They suddenly

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to

<p>Introduction: In some ways the original Amazon cloud, the one most of us still live in, was
like that really cool house that when you stepped inside and saw the oldgreen
shag carpetin the living room, you knew the house hadn't been updated in a
while. The network is a little slow, the processors are a bit dated, and
virtualization made the house just feel smaller. It has been difficult to run
high bandwidth or low latency workloads in the cloud. Bottlenecks everywhere.
Not a big deal for most applications, but for many high performance
applications (HPC) it was a killer.In a typical house you might just do a
remodel. Upgrade a few rooms. Swap out builder quality appliances with
gleaming stainless steel monsters. But Amazon has a big lot, instead of
remodeling they simply keep adding on entire new wings, kind of like the

<p>Introduction: Ricky HoinScalable System Design Patternshas created a great list of
scalability patterns along with very well done explanatory graphics. A summary
of the patterns are:Load Balancer- a dispatcher determines which worker
instance will handle a request based on different policies.Scatter and Gather-
a dispatcher multicasts requests to all workers in a pool. Each worker will
compute a local result and send it back to the dispatcher, who will
consolidate them into a single response and then send back to the
client.Result Cache- a dispatcher will first lookup if the request has been
made before and try to find the previous result to return, in order to save
the actual execution.Shared Space- all workers monitors information from the
shared space and contributes partial knowledge back to the blackboard. The
information is continuously enriched until a solution is reached.Pipe and

<p>Introduction: In many of the recent discussions on the design of large scale systems (a.k.a.
Web Scale) it was argued that the right set of tradeoffs for building large
scale systems would be to give away Consistency for Availability and Partition
tolerance. Those arguments relied on the foundation of the CAP theorem
developed in early 2000-2002. One of the core principals behind the CAP
theorem is that you must choose two out of the three CAP properties. In many
of the transactional systems giving away consistency is either impossible or
yields a huge complexity in the design of those systems. In this series of
posts, I've tried to suggest a different set of tradeoffs in which we could
achieve scalability without compromising on consistency. I also argued that
rather than choosing only two out of the three CAP properties we could choose
various degrees of all three. The degrees would be determined by the most
likely availability and partition tolerance scenarios in our specific
application.  The su</p><p>18 <a title="high_scalability-2010-949" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-29-Stuff_the_Internet_Says_on_Scalability_For_November_29th%2C_2010.html">high scalability-2010-11-29-Stuff the Internet Says on Scalability For November 29th, 2010</a></p>

websites. It's not highly technical, it's an extension course, but it's a
great introduction to a wide variety of topics. I really like his teaching
style. He continually asks questions, prompts for input, and gives accessible
explanations. Some of the topics covered: vertical scaling; horizontal
scaling; PHP acceleration; load balancing: DNS, L7, sticky sessions, load
balancers; caching; MySQL: replication, load balancing, partitioning, high
availability.Watch it onAcademic EarthThis is one lecture in a series of 13
lectures on building dynamic websites. Students learn how to: build dynamic
websites with Ajax and with Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP); set up
domain names with DNS; structure pages with XHTML and CSS how to program in

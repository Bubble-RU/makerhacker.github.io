<p>Introduction: Terrastoreis a new-born document store which provides advanced scalability and
elasticity features without sacrificing consistency.Here are a few
highlights:Ubiquitous: based on the universally supported HTTP
protocol.Distributed: nodes can run and live everywhere on your
network.Elastic: you can add and remove nodes dynamically to/from your running
cluster with no downtime and no changes at all to your configuration.Scalable
at the data layer: documents are partitioned and distributed among your nodes,
with automatic and transparent re-balancing when nodes join and leave.Scalable
at the computational layer: query and update operations are distributed to the
nodes which actually holds the queried/updated data, minimizing network
traffic and spreading computational load.Consistent: providing per-document
consistency, you're guaranteed to always get the latest value of a single
document, with read committed isolation for concurrent
modifications.Schemaless: providing a collection-based i</p><p>2 <a title="high_scalability-2009-755" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-28-Zynga_Needs_a_Server-side_Systems_Engineer.html">high scalability-2009-12-28-Zynga Needs a Server-side Systems Engineer</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I try to keep this blog targeted and on topic. So even though I may be
thankful for thesongof the tinniestsparrowatsunrise, I'll save you from all
that. It's hard to tie scalability and thegiving of thankstogether, especially
as it sometimes occurs to me that this blog may be a self-indulgent waste of
time. But I think I found a sentiment in A New THEORY of AWESOMENESS and
MIRACLES byJames Bridlethat manages to marry the topic of this blog and giving
thanks meaningfully together:I distrust commercial definitions of innovation,
and particularly of awesomeness. It's an overused term. When I think of
awesomeness, I want something awe-inspiring, vast and mind-expanding.So I
started thinking about things that I think are awesome, or miraculous, and for
me, it kept coming back to scale and complexity.We're not actually very good
about thinking about scale and complexity in real terms, so we have to use
metaphors and examples. Douglas Adams writes somewhere about how big the

<p>Introduction: Contributed by Wolfgang Gentzsch:Now that we have a new computing paradigm,
Cloud Computing, how can Clouds help our data? Replace our internal data
vaults as we hoped Grids would? Are Grids dead now that we have Clouds?
Despite all the promising developments in the Grid and Cloud computing space,
and the avalanche of publications and talks on this subject, many people still
seem to be confused about internal data and compute resources, versus Grids
versus Clouds, and they are hesitant to take the next step. I think there are
a number of issues driving this uncertainty.read more at:BigDataMatters.com</p><p>15 <a title="high_scalability-2009-742" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-17-10_eBay_Secrets_for_Planet_Wide_Scaling.html">high scalability-2009-11-17-10 eBay Secrets for Planet Wide Scaling</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Think of building websites as engineeringcomposite materials. A composite
material is when two or more materials are combined to create a third material
that does something useful that the components couldn't do on their own.
Composites like reinforced concrete have revolutionized design and
construction. When building websites we usually bring different component
materials together, like creating a composite, to get the features we need
rather than building a completely new thing from scratch that does everything
we want.This approach has been seen as a hack because it leads to inelegancies
like data duplication; great gobs of component glue; consistency issues; and
messy operations. But what if the the composite approach is really a strength,
not a hack, but a messy part of the world that needs to be embraced rather
than belittled?They key is tosee data as a material. Right now we are arguing
which is the best single material to build with. Is itNoSQL, relational,

datacenters,  2) the ability to add new machines to a live cluster

MongoDB, Neo4J, Redis, Riak, Scalaris, Tokyo Cabinet, Voldemort.A very
thorough and thoughtful article on the entire NoSQL space. It's clear from the
article that NoSQL is not monolithic, there is a very wide variety of
approaches to not being a relational database.Related ArticlesNOSQL = Not Only

can do both.GitHub tried and considered many other systems: SQS, Starling,

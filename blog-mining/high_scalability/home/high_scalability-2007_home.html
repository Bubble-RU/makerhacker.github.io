<p>Introduction: Fromhttp://directory.fsf.org/project/collectd/:'collectd' is a small daemon
which collects system information every 10 seconds and writes the results in
an RRD-file. The statistics gathered include: CPU and memory usage, system
load, network latency (ping), network interface traffic, and system
temperatures (using lm-sensors), and disk usage. 'collectd' is not a script;
it is written in C for performance and portability. It stays in the memory so
there is no need to start up a heavy interpreter every time new values should
be logged.From the collectd website:Collectd gathers information about the
system it is running on and stores this information. The information can then
be used to do find current performance bottlenecks (i. e. performance
analysis) and predict future system load (i. e. capacity planning). Or if you
just want pretty graphs of your private server and are fed up with some
homegrown solution you're at the right place, too ;).While collectd can do a
lot for you and your</p><p>2 <a title="high_scalability-2007-196" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-30-MySQL_clustering_strategies_and_comparisions.html">high scalability-2007-12-30-MySQL clustering strategies and comparisions</a></p>

graphs showing Amazon is hard to beat for small machines and become less cost
efficient for well used larger machines. Long term storage costs may eat your

<p>Introduction: Hi...I have this idea to start a really great and scalable website, and I am
building it! So far I'm doing everything myself - coding, networking,
architecture planning, everything. I haven't even gotten into the legal
aspects yet.......It would be MUCH easier if I had a technical person to
handle that end of the operation. I'm a good coder, but like Bill Gates at
Harvard for Math, I'm not the very best. I'd like to FIND that very best
person available, to handle the technical aspects. For worse or better, I
don't presently know somebody who fits this bill.I've posted a bazillion ads
on Craig's List, with no really qualified responses. I've put out feelers
among my own network, same result. Not sure what else I can do. Shoestring
budget, so it's sweat equity in the beginning. That can actually be a plus, as
it forces people to focus.Any ideas about what else I can do, to attract the
right person?ThanksJason</p><p>6 <a title="high_scalability-2007-192" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-25-IBMer_Says_LAMP_Can%27t_Scale.html">high scalability-2007-12-25-IBMer Says LAMP Can't Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A very entertaining and somewhat educational article onIBM Poopheads say LAMP
UsersNeed to "grow up". The physical three tier architecture turns out to be
the root of all evil and shared nothing architectures brings simplicity and
light.In the commentsSimon Willisonmakes an insightful comment on why fine
grained caching works for personalized pages and proxy's don't:Great post, but
I have to disagree with you on the finely grained caching part. If you look at
big LAMP deployments such as Flickr, LiveJournal and Facebook the common
technology component that enables them to scale is memcached - a tool for
finely grained caching. That's not to say that they aren't doing shared-
nothing, it's just that memcached is critical for helping the database layer
scale. LiveJournal serves around 50% of its page views "permission controlled"
(friends only) so an HTTP proxy on the front end isn't the right solution -
but memcached reduces their database hits by 90%.</p><p>7 <a title="high_scalability-2007-191" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-23-Synchronizing_Memcached_application.html">high scalability-2007-12-23-Synchronizing Memcached application</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Release It!authorMichael Nygard tells a tale of two web sites, both brought
low by unexpectedly huge unbounded results sets that slowed down their sites
to the speed of a Christmas checkout line.I've committed this error more than
a few times. During testing the results sets are often small, so you don't see
problems. Or when a product is new you don't have a lot of data so everything
is fine, until some magic line is crossed and you get that dreaded 2AM fix it
call.breakMy most embarrassing bug of this type caused a rather spectacular
failure at a customer site as the variance in response times was out of spec
and this kicked in penalty clauses. What happened was the customer had a
larger network than we could even test (customers always get the good stuff).
I took a lock and went to get all the data. Because the result set was so much
larger in their larger system I took the lock for many more milliseconds than
I should have. Unknown to me a chunk of code on the critical path also wa</p><p>10 <a title="high_scalability-2007-188" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-19-How_can_I_learn_to_scale_my_project%3F.html">high scalability-2007-12-19-How can I learn to scale my project?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a question asked on theycombinatorlist and there are some good
responses. I gave a quick response, but I particularly like neilk's knock out
of the park insightful answer:Read Cal Henderson's book. (I'd add in Theo's
book and Release It! too)The center of your design should be the data store,
not a process. You transition the data store from state to state, securely and
reliably, in small increments.Avoid globals and session state. The more "pure"
your function is, the easier it will be to cache or partition.Don't make your
data store too smart. Calculations and renderings should happen in a separate,
asynchronous process.The data store should be able to handle lots of
concurrent connections. Minimize locking. (Read about optimistic
locking).Protect your algorithm from the implementation of the data store,
with a helper class or module or whatever. But don't (DO NOT) try to build a
framework for any conceivable query. Just the ones your algorithm
needs.Viewing an application as</p><p>11 <a title="high_scalability-2007-187" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-14-The_Current_Pros_and_Cons_List_for_SimpleDB.html">high scalability-2007-12-14-The Current Pros and Cons List for SimpleDB</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Not surprisingly opinions onSimpleDBvary from it sucks, don't take my
database, to it will change the world, who needs a database anyway? From
aquick survey of the blogosphere, here's where SimpleDB stands at the
moment:SimpleDB ConsNo SLA. We don't know how reliable it will be, how fast it
will be, or how consistent the performance will be.Consistency constraints are
relaxed. Reading data immediately after a write may not reflect the latest
updates. To programmers used to transactions, this may be surprising, but many
people think this is one of the tradeoffs that needs to be made to
scale.Database is a core competency. If you don't control your database you
can't out compete your competition.When your database is out of your control
you can't guarantee it will work properly. You can't create the proper indexes
and other optimizations.No join or IN operator. You'll need to do multiple
client side calls to simulate joins, which will be slow.No stored procedures,
referential integrity,</p><p>12 <a title="high_scalability-2007-186" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-13-un-article%3A_the_setup_behind_microsoft.com.html">high scalability-2007-12-13-un-article: the setup behind microsoft.com</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 3: InfoQ'sBig Architecture Up Front - A Case of Premature
Scalaculation?twines several different threads on the topic together into a
fine noose.Update 2: Kevin says thebiggest problems he sees with startups is
they need to scaletheir backend (no, the other one).Update: My bad.It's hard
to sell scalabilityso just forget it.The premise ofStartups and The Problem Of
Premature ScalaculationandDonâ&euro;&trade;t scale: 99.999% uptime is for Wal-Martis that
you shouldn't spend precious limited resources worrying about scaling before
you've first implemented the functionality that will make you successful
enough to have scaling problems in the first place. It's kind of an embodied
life force model of system creation. Energy is scarce so any parasites
siphoning off energy must be hunted down and destroyed so the body has its
best chance of survival. Is this really how it works?If I ever believed this I
certainly don't believe it anymore. The world has changed, even since

<p>Introduction: Amazon has announced the limited beta of Amazon SimpleDB - a simple web
services interface to create and store multiple data sets, query your data
easily, and return the results. Together with the Simple Storage Service (S3),
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and other web services Amazon offers a complete
utility computing platform. SimpleDB was the missing piece of AWS - the
scalable structured database.Check out my blog entry:

<p>Introduction: Update: Facebook pulls a Microsoft and embraces and extends by opening their
platform to other social sites like Bebo. Very smart and unexpected. More info
atFacebook to let other sites access platform code.This month's regular
FacebookMeetupwas held at Google and the topic of the day wasOpenSocial. For
those of you with real lives, OpenSocial "provides a common set of APIs for
social applications across multiple websites." Over 200 excited people, hoping
to do very exciting things, and dreaming of making an exciting pile of money,
watched an OpenSocial presentation put on by a couple of appropriately
knowledgeable evangelists. I could feel my social graph being more
successfully monetized with each passing minute.Normally the meetings are much
smaller, but Google puts on a very nice spread, so I think people may have
showed up to dine :-) Or they could have showed up to learn why and how they
should code to the new uber social API. By the looks of the full plates and

<p>Introduction: People sometimes wonder why Oracle isn't mentioned on this site more. Maybe it
will now asMichael Nygard reportsOracle 11g now does read/write splitting with
theirActive Data Guardproduct. Average replication latency was 1 second and
it's accomplished with standard Oracle JDBC drivers. They see a 250% increase
in transactions per service for read-write service. And a 110% improvement in
tps for read-only service was found. You see a change in hardware architecture
with the new setup. They now recommend using a primary and multiple standby
servers, a single controller per server, and a single set of disks in RAID1.
Previously the recommendation was to have a primary and secondary server with
two controllers per server and a set of mirrored disks per controller. The
changes increase performance, availability, and hardware utilization. They
also have a useful looking best practices document for High Availability
calledMaximum Availability Architecture (MAA).</p><p>17 <a title="high_scalability-2007-181" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-11-Hosting_and_CDN_for_startup_video_sharing_site.html">high scalability-2007-12-11-Hosting and CDN for startup video sharing site</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This question is for all the gurus here. Please help this novicexI am starting
a video sharing site like YouTube in India. I want to offer the best quality
possible, at minimum cost. Nothing new about it, right? :).I have done some
research on the dedicated hosting services and CDN services available and I
have some basic knowledge on these.Following are my requirements1) My budget
is $500 to $1000 per month for hosting (including CDN if and as applicable).2)
I will need around 500GB of storage and 1TB per month of bandwidth in first
2-3 months and then about 10TB of storage and 5TB per month of bandwidth. And
more ... depending on how big it gets (I can afford more when it gets big)3)
90% of my viewers are in India. Other 10% are in US and UK.Based on the above,
could you please answer my following questions?1) Can I go with just a good
dedicated server to start with and get a CDN service later on when the site
gets big? Or do you think its wise to start with a CDN service?2) Should I</p><p>18 <a title="high_scalability-2007-180" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-10-Scalability_Developer_Competition_Launched_by_GigaSpaces_-_%2425k_in_prizes.html">high scalability-2007-12-10-Scalability Developer Competition Launched by GigaSpaces - $25k in prizes</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is an unusually well written anduseful paper. It talks in detail about
experiences implementing a complex project, something we don't see very often.
They shockingly even admit that creating a working implementation of Paxos was
more difficult than just translating the pseudo code. Imagine that,
programmers aren't merely typists! I particularly like the explanation of the
Paxos algorithm and why anyone would care about it, working with disk
corruption, using leases to support simultaneous reads, using epoch numbers to
indicate a new master election, using snapshots to prevent unbounded logs,
using MultiOp to implement database transactions, how they tested the system,
and their openness with the various problems they had. A lot to learn
here.From the paper:We describe our experience building a fault-tolerant data-
base using the Paxos consensus algorithm. Despite the existing literature in
the field, building such a database proved to be non-trivial. We describe

<p>Introduction: Georeplication is one of the standard techniques for dealing when bad things--
failure and latency--happen to good systems. The problem is always: how do you
do that? Murat Demirbas, Associate Professor at SUNY Buffalo, has a couple of
really good posts that can help:MDCC: Multi-Data Center Consistency andMaking
Geo-Replicated Systems Fast as Possible, Consistent when Necessary. In MDCC:
Multi-Data Center Consistency Murat discusses a paper that says synchronous
wide-area replication can be feasible. There's a quick and clear explanation
of Paxos and various optimizations that is worth the price of admission. We
find that strong consistency doesn't have to be lost across a WAN:The good
thing about using Paxos over the WAN is you /almost/ get the full CAP  (all
three properties: consistency, availability, and partition-freedom). As we
discussed earlier (Paxos taught), Paxos is CP, that is, in the presence of a
partition, Paxos keeps consistency over availability. But, Paxos can still

<p>Introduction: Update: Barbara Liskov's Turing Award, and Byzantine Fault Tolerance.Henry
Robinson has created an excellent series of articles on consensus protocols.
We already covered his2 Phase Commitarticle and he also has a3 Phase
Commitarticle showing how to handle 2PC under single node failures.But that is
not enough! 3PC works well under node failures, but fails for network
failures. So another consensus mechanism is needed that handles both network
and node failures. And that'sPaxos.Paxos correctly handles both types of
failures, but it does this by becoming inaccessible if too many components
fail. This is the "liveness" property of protocols. Paxos waits until the
faults are fixed. Read queries can be handled, but updates will be blocked
until the protocol thinks it can make forward progress.The liveness of Paxos
is primarily dependent on network stability. In a distributed heterogeneous
environment you are at risk of losing the ability to make updates. Users hate
that.breakSo when compani</p><p>5 0.1497926 <a title="1243-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-14-Using_Gossip_Protocols_for_Failure_Detection%2C_Monitoring%2C_Messaging_and_Other_Good_Things.html">1142 high scalability-2011-11-14-Using Gossip Protocols for Failure Detection, Monitoring, Messaging and Other Good Things</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When building a system on top of a set of wildly uncooperative and unruly
computers you have knowledge problems: knowing when other nodes are dead;
knowing when nodes become alive; getting information about other nodes so you
can make local decisions, like knowing which node should handle a request
based on a scheme for assigning nodes to a certain range of users; learning
about new configuration data; agreeing on data values; and so on.How do you
solve these problems? A common centralized approach is to use a database and
all nodes query it for information. Obvious availability and performance
issues for large distributed clusters. Another approach is to use Paxos, a
protocol for solving consensus in a network to maintain strict consistency
requirements for small groups of unreliable processes. Not practical when
larger number of nodes are involved.So what's the super cool decentralized way
to bring order to large clusters?Gossip protocols, which maintain relaxed
consistency requireme</p><p>6 0.14172739 <a title="1243-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-30-The_AOL_XMPP_scalability_challenge.html">234 high scalability-2008-01-30-The AOL XMPP scalability challenge</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Neil Conwayfrom Berkeley CS is giving an advanced level talk ata meetup today
in San Francisco on a new paper: Logic and Lattices for Distributed
Programming \- extending set logic to support CRDT-style lattices. The
description of the meetup is probably the clearest introduction to the
paper:Developers are increasingly choosing datastores that sacrifice strong
consistency guarantees in exchange for improved performance and availability.
Unfortunately, writing reliable distributed programs without the benefit of
strong consistency can be very challenging. In this talk, I'll discuss work
from our group at UC Berkeley that aims to make it easier to write distributed
programs without relying on strong consistency. Bloom is a declarative
programming language for distributed computing, while CALM is an analysis
technique that identifies programs that are guaranteed to be eventually
consistent. I'll then discuss our recent work on extending CALM to support a

<p>Introduction: Looks like an interesting take on "a completely asynchronous, low-latency
transaction management protocol, in line with the fully distributed NoSQL
architecture."Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores
overview:Implementing ACID transactions has been a longstanding challenge for
NoSQL systems. Because these systems are based on a sharded architecture,
transactions necessarily require coordination across multiple servers. Past
work in this space has relied either on heavyweight protocols such as Paxos or
clock synchronization for this coordination.This paper presents a novel
protocol for coordinating distributed transactions with ACID semantics on top
of a sharded data store. Called linear transactions, this protocol achieves
scalability by distributing the coordination task to only those servers that
hold relevant data for each transaction. It achieves high performance by
serializing only those transactions whose concurrent execution could
potentially yield a violation of ACI</p><p>5 0.68449122 <a title="1243-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-03-Paper%3A_Optimistic_Replication.html">507 high scalability-2009-02-03-Paper: Optimistic Replication</a></p>
<p>Introduction: To scale in the large you have to partition. Data has to be spread around,
replicated, and kept consistent (keeping replicas sufficiently similar to one
another despite operations being submittedindependently at different sites).
The result is a highly available, well performing, and scalable
system.Partitioning is required, but it's a pain to do efficiently and
correctly. UntilQuantum teleportationbecomes a reality how data is kept
consistent across a bewildering number of failure scenarios is a key design
decision.This excellent paper by Yasushi Saito and Marc Shapiro takes us on a
wild ride (OK, maybe not so wild) of different approaches to achieving
consistency.What's cool about this paper is they go over some real systems
that we are familiar with and cover how they work: DNS (single-master, state-
transfer), Usenet (multi-master), PDAs (multi-master, state-transfer, manual
or application-specific conflict resolution), Bayou (multi-master, operation-

<p>Introduction: If you are a normal human being and find thePaxos protocolconfusing, then this
paper, Paxos Made Moderately Complex, is a great find. Robbert van Renesse
from Cornell University has written a clear and well written paper with
excellent explanations.The Abstract:For anybody who has ever tried to
implement it, Paxos is by no means a simple protocol, even though it is based
on relatively simple invariants. This paper provides imperative pseudo-code
for the full Paxos (or Multi-Paxos) protocol without shying away from
discussing various implementation details. The initial description avoids
optimizations that complicate comprehension. Next we discuss liveness, and
list various optimizations that make the protocol practical.Related

<p>Introduction: From their website:FAIis an automated installation tool to install or deploy
Debian GNU/Linux and other distributions on a bunch of different hosts or a
Cluster. It's more flexible than other tools like kickstart for Red Hat,
autoyast and alice for SuSE or Jumpstart for SUN Solaris. FAI can also be used
for configuration management of a running system.You can take one or more
virgin PCs, turn on the power and after a few minutes Linux is installed,
configured and running on all your machines, without any interaction
necessary. FAI it's a scalable method for installing and updating all your
computers unattended with little effort involved. It's a centralized
management system for your Linux deployment.breakFAI's target group are system
administrators who have to install Linux onto one or even hundreds of
computers. It's not only a tool for doing a Cluster installation but a general
purpose installation tool. It can be used for installing a Beowulf cluster, a
rendering farm, a web server</p><p>3 0.72265154 <a title="1243-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-13-un-article%3A_the_setup_behind_microsoft.com.html">186 high scalability-2007-12-13-un-article: the setup behind microsoft.com</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Dryad is Microsoft's answer to Google'smap-reduce. What's the question: How do
you process really large amounts of data? My initial impression of Dryad is
it's like a giant Unix command line filter on steroids. There are lots of
inputs, outputs, tees, queues, and merge sorts all connected together by a
master exec program. What else does Dryad have to offer the scalable
infrastructure wars?Dryad models programs as the execution of a directed
acyclic graph. Each vertex is a program and edges are typed communication
channels (files, TCP pipes, and shared memory channels within a process). Map-
reduce uses a different model. It's more like a large distributed sort where
the programmer defines functions for mapping, partitioning, and reducing. Each
approach seems to borrow from the spirit of its creating organization. The
graph approach seems a bit too complicated and map-reduce seems a bit too
simple. How ironic, in the Alanis Morissette sense.Dryad is a middleware layer

<p>Introduction: Pud off*ckedcomany.com (FC) fame, a favorite site of the dot bomb era, and a
site I absolutely loved until my company became featured, has given us a look
at his backend: Why Must You Laugh At My Back End. For those whose don't
remember FC's history, TechCrunch published afitting eulogy:[FC] first went
live in 2000, chronicling failing and troubled companies in its unique and
abrasive style after the dot com bust. Within a year it had a massive audience
and was getting serious mainstream press attention. As the startup economy
became better in 2004, much of the attention the site received went away. But
a large and loyal audience remains at the site, coming back day after day for
its unique slant on the news. At its peak, FC had 4 million unique monthly
visitors.Delightfully, FC was not a real-names kind of site. Hard witty
cynicism ruled and not a single cat picture was in sight. It was a blast of
fun when all around was the enclosing dark.So when I saw Pud's post I was

Twitter uses internally as a protocol agonostic RPC system. Twitterfound some
problemswith Netty 3's memory management for buffer allocations beacause it
generated a lot of garbage during operation. When you send as many messages as
Twitter it creates a lot of GC pressure and the simple act of zero filling
newly allocated buffers consumed 50% of memory bandwidth. Netty 4 fixes this
situation with:Short-lived event objects, methods on long-lived channel
objects are used to handle I/O events.Secialized buffer allocator that uses

<p>Introduction: A lot has happened since my first article on the Stack Overflow Architecture.
Contrary to the theme of that last article, which lavished attention on Stack
Overflow's dedication to a scale-up strategy, Stack Overflow has both grown up
and out in the last few years.Stack Overflow has grown up by more then
doubling in size to over 16 million users and multiplying its number of page
views nearly 6 times to 95 million page views a month.  Stack Overflow has
grown out by expanding into theStack Exchange Network, which includes Stack
Overflow, Server Fault, and Super User for a grand total of 43 different
sites. That's a lot of fruitful multiplying going on.What hasn't changed is
Stack Overflow's openness about what they are doing. And that's what prompted
this update. A recent series of posts talks a lot about how they've been
handling their growth: Stack Exchange's Architecture in Bullet Points, Stack
Overflow's New York Data Center, Designing For Scalability of Management and
Fault Tolera</p><p>5 0.1099492 <a title="1364-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-05-Stack_Overflow_Architecture.html">671 high scalability-2009-08-05-Stack Overflow Architecture</a></p>

MonthUpdate:Startup - ASP.NETMVC, Cloud Scale & Deploymentshows an interesting
alternative approach for a Windows stack using ServerPath/GoGrid for a
dedicated database machine, elastic VMs for the front end, and a free load
balancer.Stack Overflowis a much loved programmer question and answer site
written by two guys nobody has ever heard of before. Well, not exactly. The
site was created by top programmer and blog starsJeff AtwoodandJoel Spolsky.
In that sense Stack Overflow is like a celebrity owned restaurant, only it
should be around for a while. Joel estimates 1/3 of all the programmers in the
world have used the site so they must be serving up something good.I fell in
deep like with Stack Overflow for purely selfish reasons, it helped me solve a
few difficult problems that were jabbing my eyes out with pain. I also

<p>Introduction: How would you implement a key-value storage system if you were starting from
scratch? The approach Basho settled on withBitcask, their new backend for
Riak, is an interesting combination of using RAM to store a hash map of file
pointers to values and a log-structured file system for efficient writes.  In
this excellent Changelog interview, some folks from Basho describe Bitcask in
more detail.The essential Bitcask:Keys are stored in memory for fast lookups.
All keys must fit in RAM.Writes are append-only, which means writes are
strictly sequential and do not require seeking. Writes are write-through.
Every time a value is updated the data file on disk is appended and the in-
memory key index is updated with the file pointer.Read queries are satisfied
with O(1) random disk seeks. Latency is very predictable if all keys fit in
memory because there's no random seeking around through a file.For reads, the
file system cache in the kernel is used instead of writing a complicated
caching sche</p><p>4 0.75839579 <a title="1364-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-30-Masstree_-_Much_Faster_than_MongoDB%2C_VoltDB%2C_Redis%2C_and_Competitive_with_Memcached.html">1236 high scalability-2012-04-30-Masstree - Much Faster than MongoDB, VoltDB, Redis, and Competitive with Memcached</a></p>
<p>Introduction: TheEuroSys 2012system conference has an excellent live blog summary of their
talks for:Day 1,Day 2,Day 3(thanksHenry at the Paper Trail blog). Summaries
for each of the accepted papers arehere.One of the more interesting papers
from a NoSQL perspective wasCache Craftiness for Fast Multicore Key-Value
Storage, a wonderfully detailed description of the low level techniques used
to implement Masstree:A storage system specialized for key-value data in which
all data ﬁts in memory, but must persist across server restarts. It supports

clients can traverse subsets of the database, or the whole database, in sorted
order by key. On a 16-core machine Masstree achieves six to ten million

<p>Introduction: Stardog makes a commercial graph database that is a great example of what can
be accomplished with a scale-up strategy on BigIron. In a recent article
StarDog described how they made their new 2.1 release insanely scalable,
improving query scalability by about 3 orders of magnitude and it can now
handle 50 billion triples on a $10,000 server with 32 cores and 256 GB RAM. It
can also load 20B datasets at 300,000 triples per second. What did they do
that you can also do?Avoid locks by using non-blocking algorithms and data
structures. For example, moving from BitSet to ConcurrentLinkedQueue.Use
ThreadLocal aggressively to reduce thread contention and avoid
synchronization.Batch LRU evictions in a single thread. Triggered by several
LRU caches becoming problematic when evictions were being swamped by
additions. Downside is batching increases memory pressure and GC times.Move to
SHA1 for hashing URIs, bnodes, and literal values. Making hash collisions
nearly impossible enable significant s</p><p>6 0.7543599 <a title="1364-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-16-Big_List_of_20_Common_Bottlenecks.html">1246 high scalability-2012-05-16-Big List of 20 Common Bottlenecks</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hey guys,There is a renewed push at my organization to deploy
vmware...everywhere.I am rather excited as I know we have a lot of waste when
it comes to resources.What has pricked my ears up however, is the notion of
using this technology in our very busy public facing DMZ's.Today we get lots
of spikes of traffic and we are coping very well. 40x HP blades,
apache/php/perl/tomcat/ all in HA behind HA F5's and HA Checkpoint FW's. (20
servers in 2 datacentres).The idea is, we virtualise these machines, including
the firewalls onto hosts vmware clusters that span the public interface to our
internal networks. This is something that has gone against the #1 rule I have
ever lived by while working on the inet. No airgaps from the unknown to the
known!I am interested in feedback on this scenario.From a resource
perspective, our resource requirements in the DMZ will be lowered over time
due to business change and we still have a lot of head room in our capacity.Do
you think this is change for ch</p><p>2 0.91685486 <a title="1364-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-27-Zoosk_-_The_Engineering_behind_Real_Time_Communications.html">1312 high scalability-2012-08-27-Zoosk - The Engineering behind Real Time Communications</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byPeter Offringa, VP of engineering atZoosk. Zoosk is a
50 million member romantic social network.Our members get the most rewarding
experience from Zoosk when they can interact in real-time. After all, a future
relationship is potentially at the other end of every connection a user makes.
The excitement and richness of this situation can only be fully realized in
real-time. The suite of Zoosk services facilitating these interactions are
referred to by the general description of real-time communications (RTC).
These communications are delivered using the XMPP protocol, which also powers
other popular instant messaging products. Zoosk members experience real-time
communications within three distinct interactions:Presence.  When a member is
actively connected to the Zoosk RTC infrastructure, their public status
appears as 'available'. If they are idle for a period of time, their state
transitions to 'away'. Their presence automatically changes to 'offline' when

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post bySachin Sinha, Founder ofIqlectand developer
ofBangDB.The goal for the paper is to provide the performances data for
following embedded databases under various scenarios for random operations
such as write and read. The data is presented in graphical manner to make the
data self explanatory to some extent.LevelDB:LevelDB is a fast key-value
storage library written at Google that provides an ordered mapping from string
keys to string values. Leveldb is based on LSM (Log-Structured Merge-Tree) and
uses SSTable and MemTable for the database implementation. It's written in C++
and availabe under BSD license. LevelDB treats key and value as arbitrary byte
arrays and stores keys in ordered fashion. It uses snappy compression for the
data compression. Write and Read are concurrent for the db, but write performs
best with single thread whereas Read scales with number of
coresBerkleyDB:BerkleyDB (BDB) is a library that provides high performance

</p><p>8 Storing terabytes of data in-memory is not a problem but avoiding GC to achieve predictable, low latency and being resilient to crashes are big challenges. [sent-10, score-0.526]
</p><p>9 By default, Hazelcast stores your distributed data (map entries, queue items) into Java heap which is subject to garbage collection. [sent-11, score-0.475]
</p><p>10 As your heap gets bigger, garbage collection might cause your application to pause tens of seconds, badly effecting your application performance and response times. [sent-12, score-0.541]
</p><p>11 Even if you have terabytes of cache in-memory with lots of updates, GC will have almost no effect; resulting in more predictable latency and throughput. [sent-14, score-0.361]
</p><p>12 Here is how things work: User defines the number of GB storage to have off the heap per JVM, let's say it is 40GB. [sent-16, score-0.312]

</p><p>17 In other words, every node takes equal responsibility to backup every other node. [sent-24, score-0.337]

<p>Introduction: Mozilla processes TB's of Firefox crash reports daily using HBase, Hadoop,

collecting, processing, and displaying crash reports from clients. Today the
Socorro application stores about 2.6 million crash reports per day. During

are going to demonstrate a proof of concept showing how Mozilla could

availablehere. Currently, Socorro has pythonic collectors, processors, and
middleware that communicate with HBase via the Thrift protocol. One of the

<p>Introduction: Deploying, running and monitoring application on a big cluster is a
challenging task. RecentlyHazelcastteam deployed a demo application on Amazon
EC2 platform to show how Hazelcast p2p cluster scales and screen recorded the
entire process from deployment to monitoring.Hazelcast is open source (Apache
License), transactional, distributed caching solution for Java. It is a little
more than a cache though as it provides distributed implementation of map,
multimap, queue, topic, lock and executor service. Details of running 100 node
Hazelcast cluster on Amazon EC2 can befound here. Make sure towatch the

<p>Introduction: Stardog makes a commercial graph database that is a great example of what can
be accomplished with a scale-up strategy on BigIron. In a recent article
StarDog described how they made their new 2.1 release insanely scalable,
improving query scalability by about 3 orders of magnitude and it can now
handle 50 billion triples on a $10,000 server with 32 cores and 256 GB RAM. It
can also load 20B datasets at 300,000 triples per second. What did they do
that you can also do?Avoid locks by using non-blocking algorithms and data
structures. For example, moving from BitSet to ConcurrentLinkedQueue.Use
ThreadLocal aggressively to reduce thread contention and avoid
synchronization.Batch LRU evictions in a single thread. Triggered by several
LRU caches becoming problematic when evictions were being swamped by
additions. Downside is batching increases memory pressure and GC times.Move to
SHA1 for hashing URIs, bnodes, and literal values. Making hash collisions
nearly impossible enable significant s</p><p>6 0.16793193 <a title="1221-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-25-Latency_is_Everywhere_and_it_Costs_You_Sales_-_How_to_Crush_it.html">661 high scalability-2009-07-25-Latency is Everywhere and it Costs You Sales - How to Crush it</a></p>

<p>Introduction: With BigData comes BigStorage costs. One way to store less is simplynot to
store the same data twice. That's the radically simple and powerful notion
behind data deduplication. If you are one of those who got a good laugh out of
the idea of eliminating SQL queries as a rather obvious scalability strategy,
you'll love this one, but it is a powerful feature and one I don't hear talked
about outside the enterprise. A parallel idea in programming is the once-and-
only-once principle of never duplicating code.Using deduplication technology,
for some upfront CPU usage, which is a plentiful resource in many systems that
are IO bound anyway, it's possible to reduce storage requirements by upto
20:1, depending on your data, which saves both money and disk write overhead.
This comes up because of really good article Robin Harris of StorageMojo
wrote, All de-dup works, on a paper,  A Study of Practical Deduplication by
Dutch Meyer and William Bolosky, For a great explanation of deduplication we

<p>Introduction: As it is said in the recent article"Google: Taming the Long Latency Tail -
When More Machines Equals Worse Results" , latency variability has greater
impact in larger scale clusters where a typical request is composed of
multiple distributed/parallel requests. The overall response time dramatically
decreases if latency of each request is not consistent and low. In dynamically
scalable partitioned storage systems, whether it is a NoSQL database,
filesystem or in-memory data grid, changes in the cluster (adding or removing
a node) can lead to big data moves in the network to re-balance the cluster.
Re-balancing will be needed for both primary and backup data on those nodes.
If a node crashes for example, dead node's data has to be re-owned (become
primary) by other node(s) and also its backup has to be taken immediately to
be fail-safe again. Shuffling MBs of data around has a negative effect in the
cluster as it consumes your valuable resources such as network, CPU and RAM.

warehouse at 400 terabytes. Facebookprobably generatesthat every 4 days Should
your database failover automatically or wait for the guiding hands of a
helpful human? Jeremy Zawodny in Handling Database Failover at Craigslist says
Craigslist and Yahoo! handle failovers manually. Knowing when a failure has
happened is so error prone it's better to put in a human breaker in the loop.
Others think this could be a SLA buster as write requests can't be processed
while the decision is being made. Main issue is knowing anything is true in a
distributed system is hard.Review of a paper about scalable things, MPI, and
granularity. If you like to read informed critiques that begin with phrases
like "this is simply not true" or "utter garbage" then you might find this

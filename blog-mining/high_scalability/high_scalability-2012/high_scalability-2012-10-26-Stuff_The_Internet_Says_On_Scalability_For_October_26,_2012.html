 5 Things That are Toxic to Scalability :
  
  Object Relational Mappers.  Create complex queries that hard to optimize and tweak. 
  Synchronous, Serial, Coupled or Locking Processes.  Locks are like stop signs, traffic circles keep the traffic flowing. Row level locking is better than table level locking. Use async replication. Use eventual consistency for clusters. 
  One Copy of Your Database.  A single database server is a choke point.   Create parallel databases and let a driver select between them. 
  Having No Metrics.  Visualize what's happening to your system using one of the many monitoring packages. 
  Lack of Feature Flags.  Be able to turn off features via a flag so when a spike hits features can be turned off to reduce load. 
  
 3 Ways to Boost Cloud Scalability :
  
  Use Auto-scaling.  Spin-up new instances when a threshold is passed and back down again when traffic drops.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by    Frédéric Faure    (architect at    Ysance   ), you can follow him on    twitter   . 
 
How do you scale an  AWS  (Amazon Web Services) infrastructure? This article will give you a detailed reply in two parts: the tools you can use to make the most of Amazon’s dynamic approach, and the architectural model you should adopt for a scalable infrastructure.
 
I base my report on my experience gained in several AWS production projects in casual gaming (Facebook), e-commerce infrastructures and within the mainstream GIS (Geographic Information System). It’s true that my experience in gaming ( IsCool, The Game ) is currently the most representative in terms of scalability, due to the number of users (over 800 thousand DAU – daily active users – at peak usage and over 20 million page views every day), however my experiences in e-commerce and GIS (currently underway) provide a different view of scalability, taking into account the various problems of availability and da</p><p>5 0.18492636 <a title="1348-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-25-The_Big_List_of_Articles_on_the_Amazon_Outage.html">1029 high scalability-2011-04-25-The Big List of Articles on the Amazon Outage</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Please see  The Updated Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage  for a new improved list. 
 
So many great articles have been written on the Amazon Outage. Some aim at being helpful, some chastise developers for being so stupid, some chastise Amazon for being so incompetent, some talk about the pain they and their companies have experienced, and some even predict the downfall of the cloud. Still others say we have seen a sea change in future of the cloud, a prediction that's hard to disagree with, though the shape of the change remains...cloudy.
 
I'll try to keep this list update as more information comes out. There will be a lot for developers to consider going forward. If there's a resource you think should be added, just let me know.

<p>Introduction: In a recent thread on Hacker News discussing  recent AWS price changes ,  seldo  mentioned they use AWS for business, they just never use EBS on AWS. A good question was asked:
  

How do you even do anything without using EBS?

  
Amazon certainly makes using EBS the easiest path. And EBS has a better reliability record as of late, but it's still often recommended to not use EBS. This avoids a single point of failure at the cost of a lot of complexity, though as AWS uses EBS internally, not using EBS may not save you if you use other AWS services like RDS or ELB.
 
If you don't want to use EBS, it's hard to know where to even start. A dilemma to which Kevin Nuckolls  gives a great answer :
  

Well, you break your services out onto stateless and stateful machines. After that, you make sure that each of your stateful services is resilient to individual node failure. I prefer to believe that if you can't roll your entire infrastructure over to new nodes monthly then you're unprepared fo</p><p>3 0.83327949 <a title="1348-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-04-Is_Provisioned_IOPS_Better%3F_Yes%2C_it_Delivers_More_Consistent_and_Higher_Performance_IO.html">1398 high scalability-2013-02-04-Is Provisioned IOPS Better? Yes, it Delivers More Consistent and Higher Performance IO</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Amazon created a whole new class of service with their  Provisioned IOPS  for RDS, EBS, and DynamoDB. The idea is simple. If you want more performance, you turn a dial up. If you want less, you turn a dial down. A beautifully simple model. You pay for the performance you want, which is different than their previous cloud model, where performance varied, but you paid only for what you used. 
 
The question: Do these higher priced services really work better?
 
 Rodrigo Campos  put this question to the test (only for EBS) by running a benchmark he describes in  IOMelt Provisioned IOPS EBS Benchmark Results - December 2012 .
 
The result?  Yes,   AWS Provisioned IOPS Volumes Really Deliver More Consistent and Higher Performance IO :
  

It is clear that the provisioned IOPS EBS volumes offer a huge performance upgrade when compared to the non-optimized EBS volumes, but as data has to be spread among more underlying disks or systems, it seems that the volume is increasingly more susceptibl</p><p>4 0.78363883 <a title="1348-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-15-Should_any_cloud_be_considered_one_availability_zone%3F_The_Amazon_experience_says_yes..html">1098 high scalability-2011-08-15-Should any cloud be considered one availability zone?

<p>Introduction: Amazon has a very will written account of their 8/8/2011 downtime:  Summary of the Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon RDS Service Event in the EU West Region . Power failed, backup generators failed to kick in, there weren't enough resources for EBS volumes to recover, API servers where overwhelmed, a DNS failure caused failovers to alternate availability zones to fail, a double fault occurred as the power event interrupted the repair of a different bug. All kind of typical stuff that just seems to happen.
 
Considering the  previous outage , the big question for programmers is: what does this mean? What does it mean for how systems should be structured? Have we learned something that can't be unlearned?
 
The Amazon post has lots of good insights into how EBS and RDS work, plus lessons learned. The short of the problem is large + complex = high probability of failure. The immediate fixes are adding more resources, more redundancy, more isolation between components, more automation, re</p><p>5 0.76000136 <a title="1348-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-15-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_November_15th%2C_2013.html">1549 high scalability-2013-11-15-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For November 15th, 2013</a></p>

 Quotable Quotes:                           
 
  fidotron : It feels like we've gone in one big circle, where first we move the DB on to a separate machine for performance, yet now more computation will go back to being done nearer the data (like Hadoop) and we'll try to pretend it's all just one giant computer again. 
  @pbailis : Building systems from the ground up with distribution, scale, and availability in mind is much easier than retrofitting single-node systems. 
  @merv : #awsreinvent Jassy: Netflix has 10,000s of EC2 instances. They are the final deployment scenario: All In. And others are coming. 
  Edward Capriolo : YARN... Either it is really complicated or I have brain damage

<p>Introduction: Hey, it's HighScalability time: 
  
 The Herokulypse. A cautionary tale of what can happen when scalability is left for later. Rap Genius created quite a stir ( reddit ,  Hacker News )  when they documented  high costs ($20K/month for 15 million monthly uniques) and poor performance (6 second average response times) using Heroku's  random routing mesh . The cause was tracked to queuing at the dyno level when the expectation was requests are routed to free dynos. Heroku admits  this is a problem . So poor load balancing combined with RoR single threading = poor performance, one that adding more dynos and spending more money won't necessarily help. While it seems clear Heroku didn't make this aspect of their system crystal clear, the incident has generated a lot of teaching moments, if you slog through it all. This is a developing story.

<p>Introduction: There are many reasons to roll your own  data  storage solution on top of existing technologies. We've seen stories on HighScalability about custom databases for very large sets of individual  data (like Twitter) and large amounts of binary  data  (like Facebook pictures). However, I recently ran into a  unique  type of problem. I was tasked with recording and storing bandwidth information for more than 20,000 servers and their associated networking equipment. This  data  needed to be accessed in real-time, with less than a 5 minute delay between the  data  being recorded and the  data showing up on customer bandwidth graphs on our customer portal.
 
After numerous false starts with off the shelf components and existing database clustering technology, we decided we must roll our own system. The real key to our problem (literally) was the ratio of the size of the key to the size of the actual  data . Because the tracked metric was so small (a 64-bit counter) compared to the  unique  ide</p><p>4 0.91715062 <a title="1348-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-30-Expandability%3A_Steve_Wozniak%27s_Biggest_Success_and_Nolan_Bushnell%27s_Biggest_Regret.html">1524 high scalability-2013-09-30-Expandability: Steve Wozniak's Biggest Success and Nolan Bushnell's Biggest Regret</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When two titans of the early computing industry, Apple co-founder  Steve Wozniak  and Atari founder  Nolan Bushnell , had a chance to sit down for a chat at the  C2SV  conference last Friday, we learned how a little foresight and luck can decide futures.  
  Steve Wozniak's Success - Expandability       
 
 
Steve talked about how the Apple II was the primary source of revenue for Apple's first 10 years of life. The reason the Apple II could last so long was that it was expandable. It had  eight expansion slots  and the RAM was also expandable (starting at 4K). No computer at the time had this kind of flexibility or  expansion capabilities . Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs argued over keeping the Apple II open. Jobs wanted closed, Wozniak wanted open and fortunately Wozniak won.  In fact, the Apple II was completely open (those were the days). They published the complete specs before there was anything like a developer community. 
 
So even though the Apple III, Lisa, and the Macintosh al</p><p>5 0.9167465 <a title="1348-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-18-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_18%2C_2013.html">1389 high scalability-2013-01-18-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 18, 2013</a></p>

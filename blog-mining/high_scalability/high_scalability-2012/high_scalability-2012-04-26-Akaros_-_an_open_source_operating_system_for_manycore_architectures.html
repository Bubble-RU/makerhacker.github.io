  Markus Frind :   Scaling is not very fun these days.  
  Mike Krieger : Scaling is like replacing all components on a car while driving it at 100 mph.  
  @jaykreps : We built servers that could handle 100k connections by building servers that could handle 10k connections and waiting a decade.

<p>Introduction: In the never ending quest to figure out how to do something useful with never ending streams of data,  GraphLab: A New Framework For Parallel Machine Learning  wants to go beyond low-level programming, MapReduce, and dataflow languages with  a new parallel framework for ML (machine learning) which exploits the sparse structure and common computational patterns of ML algorithms. GraphLab enables ML experts to easily design and implement efﬁcient scalable parallel algorithms by composing problem speciﬁc computation, data-dependencies, and scheduling .   Our main contributions include:  
  
  A graph-based data model which simultaneously represents data and computational dependencies.   
  A set of concurrent access models which provide a range of sequential-consistency guarantees.   
  A sophisticated modular scheduling mechanism.   
  An aggregation framework to manage global state.

<p>Introduction: Mind the Gap: Reconnecting Architecture and OS Research  is a paper presented at  HotOS XIII , the place where researchers talk about making potential futures happen. For a great overview of the conference take a look at this article by Matt Welsh:  Conference report: HotOS 2011 in Napa .
 
In the VM/cloud age I question the need of having an OS at all, programs can compile directly against "raw" hardware, but the paper does a good job of trying to figure out the new roll operating systems can play in the future. We've been in a long OS holding pattern, so long that we've seen the rise of PaaS vendors skipping the OS level abstraction completely, but there's room for a middle ground between legacy time sharing systems of the past and service level APIs that are but one possible future.
 
Introduction:
  For too long, operating systems researchers and developers have pretty much taken whatever computer architects have dished out. With occasional exceptions (e.g., virtualization support)</p><p>3 0.73674202 <a title="1234-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-19-Is_it_time_to_get_rid_of_the_Linux_OS_model_in_the_cloud%3F.html">1177 high scalability-2012-01-19-Is it time to get rid of the Linux OS model in the cloud?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You program in a dynamic language, that runs on a JVM, that runs on a OS designed  40 years ago  for a completely different purpose, that runs on virtualized hardware. Does this make sense? We've talked about this idea before in  Machine VM + Cloud API - Rewriting The Cloud From Scratch , where the vision is to treat  cloud virtual hardware as a compiler target, and converting high-level language source code directly into kernels that run on it. 
 
As new technologies evolve the friction created by our old tool chains and architecture models becomes ever more obvious. Take, for example, what a  team  at  UCSD  is releasing: a  phase-change memory prototype   -  a   solid state storage device that provides performance thousands of times faster than a conventional hard drive and up to seven times faster than current state-of-the-art solid-state drives (SSDs).  However, PCM has access latencies several times slower than DRAM.
 
This technology has obvious mind blowing implications, but an</p><p>4 0.72648919 <a title="1234-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-09-Paper%3A_Propagation_Networks%3A_A_Flexible_and_Expressive_Substrate_for_Computation_.html">839 high scalability-2010-06-09-Paper: Propagation Networks: A Flexible and Expressive Substrate for Computation </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alexey Radul in his fascinating 174 page dissertation  Propagation Networks: A Flexible and Expressive Substrate for Computation , offers to help us  break free of the tyranny of linear time by arranging computation as a network of autonomous but interconnected machines .  We can do this by  organizing computation as a network of interconnected machines of some kind, each of which is free to run when it pleases, propagating  information around the network as proves possible. The consequence of this freedom is that the structure of the aggregate does not impose an order of time.  The abstract from his thesis is : 
  In this dissertation I propose a shift in the foundations of computation. Modern programming systems are not expressive enough. The traditional image of a single computer that has global effects on a large memory is too restrictive. The propagation paradigm replaces this with computing by networks of local, independent, stateless machines interconnected with stateful storage</p><p>5 0.72176284 <a title="1234-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-05-Lessons_Learned_at_208K%3A_Towards_Debugging_Millions_of_Cores.html">484 high scalability-2009-01-05-Lessons Learned at 208K: Towards Debugging Millions of Cores</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do we debug and profile a cloud full of processors and threads? It's a problem more will be seeing as we code big scary programs that run on even bigger scarier clouds. Logging gets you far, but sometimes finding the root cause of problem requires delving deep into a program's execution. I don't know about you, but setting up 200,000+ gdb instances doesn't sound all that appealing. Tools like STAT (Stack Trace Analysis Tool) are being developed to help with this huge task. STAT "gathers and merges stack traces from a parallel applicationâ&euro;&trade;s processes." So STAT isn't a low level debugger, but it will help you find the needle in a million haystacks.  Abstract:
  Petascale systems will present several new challenges to performance and correctness tools. Such machines may contain millions of cores, requiring that tools use scalable data structures and analysis algorithms to collect and to process application data.

<p>Introduction: Alexey Radul in his fascinating 174 page dissertation  Propagation Networks: A Flexible and Expressive Substrate for Computation , offers to help us  break free of the tyranny of linear time by arranging computation as a network of autonomous but interconnected machines .  We can do this by  organizing computation as a network of interconnected machines of some kind, each of which is free to run when it pleases, propagating  information around the network as proves possible. The consequence of this freedom is that the structure of the aggregate does not impose an order of time.  The abstract from his thesis is : 
  In this dissertation I propose a shift in the foundations of computation. Modern programming systems are not expressive enough. The traditional image of a single computer that has global effects on a large memory is too restrictive. The propagation paradigm replaces this with computing by networks of local, independent, stateless machines interconnected with stateful storage</p><p>2 0.8715753 <a title="1234-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-23-Here%27s_a_1300_Year_Old_Solution_to_Resilience_-_Rebuild%2C_Rebuild%2C_Rebuild.html">1636 high scalability-2014-04-23-Here's a 1300 Year Old Solution to Resilience - Rebuild, Rebuild, Rebuild</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How is it possible that a wooden Shinto shrine built in the 7th century is still standing? The answer depends on how you answer this philosophical head scratcher: With nearly every cell in your body continually being replaced, are you still the same person?
 
The  Ise Grand Shrine  has been in continuous existence for over 1300 years because every twenty years an exact replica has been rebuilt on an adjacent footprint. The former temple is then dismantled.
 
Now that's resilience. If you want something to last make it a living part of a culture. It's not so much the building that is remade, what is rebuilt and passed down from generation to generation is the meme that the shrine is important and worth preserving. The rest is an unfolding of that imperative.
 
You can see echoes of this same process in Open Source projects like Linux and the libraries and frameworks that get themselves reconstructed in each new environment.
 
The patterns of recurrence in software are the result of Darw</p><p>same-blog 3 0.87145507 <a title="1234-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-26-Akaros_-_an_open_source_operating_system_for_manycore_architectures.html">1234 high scalability-2012-04-26-Akaros - an open source operating system for manycore architectures</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are interested in future foward OS designs then you might find  Akaros  worth a look. It's an operating system designed for many-core architectures and large-scale SMP systems, with the goals of:
  
 Providing better support for parallel and high-performance applications 
 Scaling the operating system to a large number of cores  
  
A more indepth explanation of the motiviation behind Akaros can be found in  Improving Per-Node Efﬁciency in the Datacenter with NewOS Abstractions  by Barret Rhoden, Kevin Klues, David Zhu, and Eric Brewer.
 
The abstract:
  We believe datacenters can beneﬁt from more focus on per-node efﬁciency, performance, and predictability, versus the more common focus so far on scalability to a large number of nodes. Improving per-node efﬁciency decreases costs and fault recovery because fewer nodes are required for the same amount of work. We believe that the use of complex, general-purpose operating systems is a key contributing factor to these inefﬁciencies</p><p>4 0.8374269 <a title="1234-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-18-Robert_Scoble%27s_Rules_for_Successfully_Scaling_Startups.html">352 high scalability-2008-07-18-Robert Scoble's Rules for Successfully Scaling Startups</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble in an often poignant   FriendFeed thread   commiserating PodTech's unfortunate end, shared what he learned about creating a successful startup. Here's a summary of a Robert's rules and why Machiavelli just may agree with them:       Have a story.   Have everyone on board with that story.   If anyone goes off of that story, make sure they get on board immediately or fire them.   Make sure people are judged by the revenues they bring in. Those that bring in revenues should get to run the place. People who don't bring in revenues should get fewer and fewer responsibilities, not more and more.   Work ONLY for a leader who will make the tough decisions.   Build a place where excellence is expected, allowed, and is enabled.   Fire idiots quickly.   If your engineering team can't give a media team good measurements, the entire company is in trouble. Only things that are measured ever get improved.   When your stars aren't listened to the company is in trouble.

<p>Introduction: Lightcloud is a distributed and persistent   key-value database   from   Plurk.com  . Performance is said to be comparable to memcached. It's different than   memcachedb   because it scales out horizontally by adding new nodes. It's different than memcached because it persists to disk, it's not just a cache. Now you have   one more option   in the never ending quest to ditch the RDBMS.     Their website does a nice job explaining the system:       Built on Tokyo Tyrant. One of the fastest key-value databases [benchmark]. Tokyo Tyrant has been in development for many years and is used in production by Plurk.com, mixi.jp and scribd.com (to name a few)...   Great performance (comparable to memcached!)   Can store millions of keys on very few servers - tested in production   Scale out by just adding nodes   Nodes are replicated via master-master replication.

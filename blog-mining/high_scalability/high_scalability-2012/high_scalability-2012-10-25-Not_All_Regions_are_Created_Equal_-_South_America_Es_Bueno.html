<p>Introduction: Ali Sadat ofMuleSoft gave interesting presentation at Saturday's Talk Cloudy
to Me! event about their experiences movingMule iON, their ESB (enterprise
service bus) product to the cloud.First, a little aboutTalk Cloudy to Me. This
event is the second one day cloud event put on by Sebastian Stadil, founder of
Scalr, as part of the Cloud Computing Meetup group, also created by Sebastian.
Sebastian has become a master at running these mini-conference style events.
Really a quality job by him and his dedicated crew. These events are free,
sponsored by various vendors; they are short, 11-5; the food is good, Thai;
the venue is nice, eBay; they are on topic, with cloud and other speakers
giving 30-45 minute talks.  More on the event when the video comes out. I type
as fast as I can but I can't do much without the video.Back to Ali Sadat.
While he gave a lot of lessons--the integration will your billing system will

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byPatrick Eaton, Software Engineer and Distributed
Systems Architect at Stackdriver.Stackdriver provides intelligent monitoring-
as-a-service for cloud hosted applications.  Behind this easy-to-use service
is a large distributed system for collecting and storing metrics and events,
monitoring and alerting on them, analyzing them, and serving up all the
results in a web UI.  Because we ourselves run in the cloud (mostly on AWS),
we spend a lot of time thinking about how to deal with faults in the cloud.
We have developed a framework for thinking about fault mitigation for large,
cloud-hosted systems.  We endearingly call this framework the "Four Hamiltons"
because it is inspired by an article from James Hamilton, the Vice President
and Distinguished Engineer at Amazon Web Services.The article that led to this
framework is called "The Power Failure Seen Around the World".  Hamilton
analyzes the causes of the power outage that affected Super Bowl XLVII in
early 2013.</p><p>4 0.11657801 <a title="1347-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-15-Building_a_Database_remote_availability_site.html">1041 high scalability-2011-05-15-Building a Database remote availability site</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The AWS East Region outage showed all of us the importance of running our apps
and databases across multiple Amazon regions (or multiple cloud providers). In
this post, I'll try to explain how to build a MySQL (or Amazon RDS) redundant
site.For simplicity, we create a passive redundant site. This means that the
site is not used during normal operation and only comes into action when the
primary site crashes. There are many reasons for choosing such an architecture
- it's easy to configure, simple to understand, and minimizes the risk of data
collision. The downside is that you have hardware just sitting around doing
nothing.Still, it's a common enough scenario. So what do we need to do to make
it work?DATA SYNCHRONIZATIONWe need to synchronize the database. This is done
by means of database replication. Now, there are two options for database
replication: synchronous and a-synchronous. Synchronous replication is great;
it ensures that the backup database is identical to the primary dat</p><p>5 0.10850288 <a title="1347-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-02-An_Epic_TripAdvisor_Update%3A_Why_Not_Run_on_the_Cloud%3F_The_Grand_Experiment..html">1331 high scalability-2012-10-02-An Epic TripAdvisor Update: Why Not Run on the Cloud?

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byShawn Hsiao,Luke Massa, andVictor Luu. Shawn
runsTripAdvisor's Technical Operations team, Luke and Victor interned on his
team this past summer. This post is introduced byAndy Gelfond, TripAdvisor's
head of engineering.It's been a little over a year since our last post about
theTripAdvisor architecture. It has been an exciting year. Our business and
team continues to grow, we are now an independent public company, and we have
continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown -
we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work
across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:56M visitors per
month350M+ pages requests a day120TB+ of warehouse data running on a large
Hadoop cluster, and quickly growingWe also had a very successful college
intern program that brought on over 60 interns this past summer, all who were

<p>Introduction: Authored by Chris Fregly:  Former Netflix Streaming Platform Engineer, AWS
Certified Solution Architect and Purveyor of fluxcapacitor.com.Ahead of the
upcoming 2nd annual re:Invent conference, inspired by Simone Brunozzi's
recentpresentationat an AWS Meetup in San Francisco, and collected from a few
of my recentFluxcapacitor.com consulting engagements, I've compiled a list of
10 useful time and clock-tick saving tips about AWS.1) Query AWS resource
metadata Can't remember the EBS-Optimized IO throughput of your c1.xlarge
cluster?  How about the size limit of an S3 object on a single PUT?
awsnow.infois the answer to all of your AWS-resource metadata questions.
Interested in integrating awsnow.info with your application?  You're in luck.
There's now aREST API, as well!Note:  These are default soft limits and will
vary by account.2) Tame your S3 buckets Delete an entire S3 bucket with a

<p>Introduction: When EC2 first started the mental model was of a magic Pez dispenser supplying
an infinite stream of instances in any desired flavor. If you needed an
instance, because of a either a failure or traffic spike, it would be there.
As amazing as EC2 is, this model turned out to be optimistic.  From athread on
the Amazon discussion forum we learn any dispenser has limits:As Availability
Zones grow over time, our ability to continue to expand them can become
constrained. In these scenarios, we will prevent customers from launching in
the constrained zone if they do not yet have existing resources in that zone.
We also might remove the constrained zone entirely from the list of options
for new customers. This means that occasionally, different customers will see
a different number of Availability Zones in a particular Region. Both
approaches aim to help customers avoid accidentally starting to build up their
infrastructure in an Availability Zone where they might have less ability to
expand.T</p><p>4 0.79134929 <a title="1347-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-19-Strategy%3A_Order_Two_Mediums_Instead_of_Two_Smalls_and_the_EC2_Buffet.html">812 high scalability-2010-04-19-Strategy: Order Two Mediums Instead of Two Smalls and the EC2 Buffet</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Vaibhav PuranikinWeb serving in the cloud - our experiences with nginx and
instance sizesdescribes their experience trying to maximum traffic and minimum
their web serving costs on EC2. Initially they tested with two m1.small
instance types and then they the switched to two c1.mediums instance types.
The m1s are the standard instance types and the c1s are the high CPU instance
types. Obviously the mediums have greater capability, but the cost difference
was interesting:In the long term they will save money using the larger
instances and not autoscaling. With the small instances, traffic bursts caused
autoscaling to kick in. New instances were started in response to load. The
instances woud be up for a short period of time and then spin down again. This
constant churn costs a lot of money. Selecting the larger instance sizes,
which are capable of handling the load without autoscaling, turn out to save
money even though they are more expensive. Starting new instances also takes a
few min</p><p>5 0.76991093 <a title="1347-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-18-Strategy%3A_Kill_Off_Multi-tenant_Instances_with_High_CPU_Stolen_Time.html">1286 high scalability-2012-07-18-Strategy: Kill Off Multi-tenant Instances with High CPU Stolen Time</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Are all instances created equal? Perhaps because under multi-tenancy multiple
virtual machines run on the same physical host, not all applications will run
equally well on every instance. In that case it makes sense to measure and
move to a better performing instance. That's the interesting idea
from@botchagalupe:Imagine something like a "performance monkey" where an
infrastructure is so bound that it can kill lower performing instances
automatically.@adriancosays Netflix has throught of doing the same: We've

<p>Introduction: Rodrigo Camposshared some interesting benchmark resultsfor AWS instances in
the South America Region (Sao Paulo) and US East Region (North Virginia). He
summarized the results in this thread on theGuerrilla Capacity
Planninglist:The same instance type shows a different behavior depending on
the region that it is running, this is particularly critical if you depend on
multiple regions for disaster recovery or geographical load balancingGenerally
speaking performance is better and more consistent in the South America region
when compared to Virginia, this is probably due to the fact that SA region was
the latest to be deployed. Maybe the SA datacenter uses new server models or
it is just underutilized, but this is a wild guessWrite performance for the
medium instance type in Virginia abruptly decays, dropping from almost 400
call/s to something around 300 calls/s, this is not very clear in the scatter
plot but if you draw a time-based chart you can clearly see this pattern. This

<p>Introduction: Update: Deployment with Capistrano  by Charles Max Wood.  Nice simple step-by-
step for using Capistrano for deployment.From their website:Simply
put,Capistranois a tool for automating tasks on one or more remote servers. It
executes commands in parallel on all targeted machines, and provides a
mechanism for rolling back changes across multiple machines. It is ideal for
anyone doing any kind of system administration, either professionally or
incidentally.* Great for automating tasks via SSH on remote servers, like
software installation, application deployment, configuration management, ad
hoc server monitoring, and more.* Ideal for system administrators, whether
professional or incidental.* Easy to customize. Its configuration files use
the Ruby programming language syntax, but you don't need to know Ruby to do
most things with Capistrano.* Easy to extend. Capistrano is written in the
Ruby programming language, and may be extended easily by writing additional
Ruby modules.breakOne of t</p><p>3 0.69329673 <a title="1347-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-05-Strategy%3A__In_Cloud_Computing_Systematically_Drive_Load_to_the_CPU.html">526 high scalability-2009-03-05-Strategy:  In Cloud Computing Systematically Drive Load to the CPU</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2:Linear Bloom Filtersby Edward Kmett. A Bloom filter is a novel data
structure for approximating membership in a set. A Bloom join conserves
network bandwith by exchanging cheaper, more plentiful local CPU utilization

for CPU time in voodoo units like "compute units" and "core hours." Geva Perry
takes on the quest of figuring out what these mean in real life.breakI
attended Sebastian Stadil'sAWS Training CampSaturday and during the class
Sebastian brought up a wonderfully counter-intuitive idea:CPU (EC2) costs a
lot less than storage (S3, SDB) so you should systematically move as much work
as you can to the CPU. This is said to be theClient-Cloud Paradigm. It
leverages the well pummeled trend that CPU power follows Moore's Law while
storage followsThe Great Plains' Law(flat). And what sane computing

<p>Introduction: InScaling writes in MySQL (slides) Philip Tellis, while working for Yahoo,
describes how using time based partitions they were able to increase their
write capability from 2100 inserts per second (7 million a day) to a sustained
8500 inserts per second (734 million a day). This was capacity enough to
handle the load during Michael Jackson's memorial service. In summary, the
secrets to scalable writes are:Bulk inserts push up insert ratePartitioning
lets you insert more recordsPartition based on incoming data for fast
insertsPartitioning is a standard approach for handling high write loads
because it means data can be written to different hard disks in parallel. In
this example Phillip created a separate table for each day with each table
having it's own database file. Each table is partitioned on time, 12
partitions per day, 2 hours of data per partition. Huge log streams are often
handled this way. Other advantages of this approach: 1) fast drop table
operations 2) space for dropped t</p><p>5 0.656084 <a title="1347-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-03-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_March_3%2C_2010.html">787 high scalability-2010-03-03-Hot Scalability Links for March 3, 2010</a></p>

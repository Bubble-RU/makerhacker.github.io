<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-
grid.It's 2003: Add a caching layer.It's 2004: Add scale-out and
partitioning.It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>6 0.11765311 <a title="1203-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-14-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_14th%2C_2014.html">1596 high scalability-2014-02-14-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 14th, 2014</a></p>

CRDTs: Consistency without concurrency control by Mihai Letia, Nuno Preguiรงa,
and Marc Shapiro, which talks about CRDTs (Commutative Replicated Data Type),a
data type whose operations commute when they are concurrent.From the
introduction, which also serves as a nice concise overview of distributed
consistency issues:Shared read-only data is easy to scale by using well-
understood replication techniques. However, sharing mutable data at a large
scale is a difficult problem, because of the CAP impossibility result [5]. Two
approaches dominate in practice. One ensures scalability by giving up
consistency guarantees, for instance using the Last-Writer-Wins (LWW) approach

<p>Introduction: This is a hilarious presentation byJosh Berkus, calledScale Fail, given at
O'Reilly MySQL CE 2011. Josh is entertaining, well spoken, and cleverly hides
insight inside chaos. And he makes some dang good points along the way.Josh
has a problem, you see Josh has learned how to make sites that are both
scalable and reliable. So he's puzzled why companies "whose downtime
interfaces (Twitter) are more well known than their uptime interfaces" get all
the attention, respect, and money for being failures. Just doing your job
doesn't make you a hero.  You need these self-inflicted wounds in-order to
have the war stories to share at conferences. They get the attention. Just
doing your job is boring. This is so unfair in that way life can be. So if you
want to turn the tables and take the low road to fame and fortune, here's
Josh's program for learning how not to scale:Be trendy. Use the tool that has
the most buzz: NoSQL, Cloud, MapReduce, Rails, RabbitMQ. It helps you not

<p>Introduction: Performance guruSteve Souders gave his keynote presentation, Cache is King!
(slides), at the HTML5DevCon, besides being an extremely clear explanation of
how caching works on the Internet and how to optimize your use of HTTP to get
the best performance, Steve ran experiments that found some surprising results
on what gave the best web site performance improvements.In his base line test,
page loads took 7.65 seconds (median of three runs). What change--Fast
Network, No Javascript, or Primed Cache--would make the biggest performance
improvement? It was Primed Cache.Fast Network - Using a fast FIOS network the
load time was 4.13 seconds. Steve was surprised how big a difference this
made, given how much work must happen in the browser. No JavaScript - 4.74
seconds after disabling JavaScript. Both reduces transfers and skips parsing
by the browser. Steve thought the effect would have been larger.Primed Cache-

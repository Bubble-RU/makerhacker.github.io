<p>Introduction: A consequence of Service Oriented Architectures is the burning need to provide services at scale. The architecture that has evolved to satisfy these requirements is a little known technique called the Cell Architecture.  A Cell Architecture is based on the idea that massive scale requires parallelization and parallelization requires components be isolated from each other. These islands of isolation are called cells. A cell is a self-contained installation that can satisfy all the operations for a  shard . A shard is a subset of a much larger dataset, typically a range of users, for example.   Cell Architectures have several advantages:
  
 Cells provide a unit of parallelization that can be adjusted to any size as the user base grows. 
 Cell are added in an incremental fashion as more capacity is required. 
 Cells isolate failures. One cell failure does not impact other cells. 
 Cells provide isolation as the storage and application horsepower to process requests is independent of othe</p><p>3 0.12931775 <a title="1270-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-13-Tumblr_Architecture_-_15_Billion_Page_Views_a_Month_and_Harder_to_Scale_than_Twitter.html">1191 high scalability-2012-02-13-Tumblr Architecture - 15 Billion Page Views a Month and Harder to Scale than Twitter</a></p>

recallInstagram was profiled on HighScalabilityand they were also bought by
Facebook for a ton of money. A coincidence? You be the judge.Just what is
Yahoo buying? The business acumen of the deal is not something I can judge,

 Clay Shirky: I think one of the things that happened to the P2P market for infrastructure is that users preference for predictable pricing vs resource-sensitive pricing is so overwhelming that they will overpay to anyone who can promise flat prices. And because the logic of centralization vs decentralization is so price sensitive, I don't think there is any logical reason to assume a broadly stable class of apps, separate from c</p><p>3 0.81871533 <a title="1270-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-03-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_3%2C_2012.html">1297 high scalability-2012-08-03-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 3, 2012</a></p>

  Ross Tur : the tricks you learned to make things big are not the same tricks you can apply to make things infinite.  
  @gclaramunt : Son, I'm getting old, but let me tell you a secret: programming is hard, and high scalability and concurrent programming... frigging hard! 
 
 
  @Carnage4Life : At Apple the iOS team didn't see iPhone hardware or hardware team see OS until it shipped 
  @adrianco :  #ebspio caps iops but latency variance is much lower than EBS 
  @bernardgolden : RT @peakscale: A culture of automation is 10x more important than deployment/test/monkey thing you'd like to discuss < devops calling 
  @JayCollier : 50 years ago, school standardization was needed for scale. Now, scalability and flexibility (variability) can coexist. #FOL2012 
  @adrianco : Compared to vanilla EBS many times better for random reads. Bandwidth limits both for sequential and writes.  #ebspio

<p>Introduction: Between love and madness lies  HighScalability : 
  
  Google now 10x better : MapReduce sorts 1 petabyte of data using 8000 computers in 33 minutes;  1 Billion on Social Networks ;  Tumblr at 10 Billion Posts ;  Twitter at 100 Million Users ;  Testing at Google Scale : 1800 builds, 120 million test suites, 60 million tests run daily. 
 From the  Dash Memo  on Google's Plan:  Go is a very promising systems-programming language in the vein of C++. We fully hope and expect that Go becomes the standard back-end language at Google over the next few years.  On GAE  Go can load from  a cold start in 100ms and the typical instance size is 4MB. Is it any wonder Go is a go? Should we expect to see Java and Python deprecated because Go is so much cheaper to run at scale?

<p>Introduction: At the core of the new real-time web, which is really really old, are continuous queries. I like how this paper proposed to handle dynamic demand and dynamic resource availability by making the underlying system adaptable, which seems like a very cloudy kind of thing to do.  Abstract:
   The long-running nature of continuous queries poses new scalability challenges for dataflow processing. CQ systems execute pipelined dataflows that may be shared across multiple queries. The scalability of these dataflows is limited by their constituent, stateful operators â&euro;&ldquo; e.g. windowed joins or grouping operators. To scale such operators, a natural solution is to partition them across a shared-nothing platform. But in the CQ context, traditional, static techniques for partitioned parallelism can exhibit detrimental imbalances as workload and runtime conditions evolve. Longrunning CQ dataflows must continue to function robustly in the face of these imbalances. To address this challenge, we introduce</p><p>2 0.93406641 <a title="1270-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-22-Strategy%3A_Stop_Using_Linked-Lists.html">1462 high scalability-2013-05-22-Strategy: Stop Using Linked-Lists</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What data structure is more sacred than the link list? If we get rid of it what silly interview questions would we use instead? But not using linked-lists is exactly what Aater Suleman recommends in  Should you ever use Linked-Lists?  
 
In  The Secret To 10 Million Concurrent Connections  one of the important strategies is not scribbling data all over memory via pointers because following pointers increases cache misses which  reduces performance . And there’s nothing more iconic of pointers than the link list.
 
Here are Aeter's reasons to be anti-linked-list:
  
 They reduce the benefit of out-of-order execution.  
 They throw off hardware prefetching.  
 They reduce DRAM and TLB locality.  
 They cannot leverage SIMD.  
 They are harder to send to GPUs.  
  
He also demolishes the pros of linked-lists, finding arrays a better option in almost every case. Good discussion in the comment section as not everyone agrees.

 You are the next computer.  Cells are capable of arithmetic  using two naturally occurring molecules: erythromycin, an antibiotic, and phloretin, found in Apple trees. "These act as inputs, switching a reaction within the two types of cell on or off. The reaction leads to the production of a red or green fluorescent protein that signals the result of the calculation. For example, in the half adder cell, the presence of both molecules makes it glow red."

<p>Introduction: The Gear6 Web Cache hybrid DRAM-flash memory architecture allows for 5-10 times more memcache memory per unit of rack space than DRAM-only configurations, and cuts memory costs by 50%. Other software enhancements include a slab allocator that is more efficient than traditional memcache implementations due to its fine-grained bucket sizing. Gear6 Web Cache also supports object sizes greater than 1 megabyte and manages evictions based on the cost of replacing objects, depending on the size and frequency of object access. It intelligently places cache instances across DRAM and flash, taking into account their different characteristics, while at the same time monitoring their health and detecting and deâ&euro;?allocating faulty or failing memory.  Gear6 Web Cache is a Memcached protocol compliant solution that scales and accelerates web applications, reduces memory footprint, enhances availability and implements comprehensive Memcached management features.

<p>Introduction: Jurriaan Persyn is a Lead Web Developer at Netlog, a social portal site that gets 50 million unique visitors and 5+ billion page views per month. In this paper Jurriaan goes into a lot of excellent nuts and bolts details about how they used sharding to scale their system. If you are pondering sharding as a solution to your scaling problems you'll want to read this paper. As the paper is quite well organized there's no reason to write a summary, but I especially liked this part from the conclusion:       If you can do with simpler solutions (better hardware, more hardware, server tweaking and tuning, vertical partitioning, sql query optimization, ...) that require less development cost, why invest lots of effort in sharding? On the other hand, when your visitor statistics really start blowing through the roof, it is a good direction to go.

<p>Introduction: Hi all!  So nice to start discussing cool things in this even cooler forum :)  I am having a problem .. which i believe is already solved but i would love someone confirming actual experience with the same topic.  We are building a client / server architecture, consisting of a web server part and many clients.  Transport will be provided as either XML-RPC / SOAP / JSON or all at once. All of the communication has to be encrypted and passed within SSL3.  We expect a high load when the application starts (> 2000 concurrent requests). Combine this with xml parsing for the rpc api, things really look ugly :) So it's a big mess :)  It will not be that much database bound behind the api - mostly files will be transferred from the server to the clients and simple api for control.  So it's pretty much a matter of 'what-to-do-with-ssl'.  I was thinking of hardware - NetApp or a similar application accelerator.  Can anyone give examples of a hardware piece that combines: Load balancer / SSL acce</p><p>3 0.11499017 <a title="1263-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-18-Amazon_Architecture.html">96 high scalability-2007-09-18-Amazon Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the ACM Queue article have also been included.   Amazon grew from a tiny online bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden shared is version of Amazon's birth pangs in a series of blog articles

<p>Introduction: Update :  Organism without a brain creates external memories for navigation  shows slime mold is even cooler than originally thought, storing a record of where it's been using slime: The authors conclude, the slime isn't just the mold's calling card. Instead, it's a way of marking the environment so that the organism can sense where it's been, and not expend effort on searches that won't pay off. Although the situation isn't an exact parallel, the authors make a comparison to the pheromone trails used by ants.

<p>Introduction: The  EuroSys 2012  system conference has an excellent live blog summary of their talks for:  Day 1 ,  Day 2 ,  Day 3  (thanks  Henry at the Paper Trail blog ). Summaries for each of the accepted papers are  here .
 
One of the more interesting papers from a NoSQL perspective was  Cache Craftiness for Fast Multicore Key-Value Storage , a wonderfully detailed description of the low level techniques used to implement Masstree:
  

A storage system specialized for key-value data in which all data ﬁts in memory, but must persist across server restarts. It supports arbitrary, variable-length keys. It allows range queries over those keys: clients can traverse subsets of the database, or the whole database, in sorted order by key. On a 16-core machine Masstree achieves six to ten million operations per second on parts A–C of the Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark benchmark, more than 30 as fast as VoltDB [5] or MongoDB [2].

<p>Introduction: Algorithms are moving out of the Platonic realm and are becoming dynamic first class players in real life. We've seen corporations become people. Algorithms will likely also follow that path to agency.
 
 Kevin Slavin  in his intriguing TED talk:  How Algorithms Shape Our World , gives many and varied examples of how algorithms have penetrated RL. 
 
One of his most interesting examples is from a highly technical paper on  Relativistic statistical arbitrage , which says to make money on markets you have to be where the people are, the red dots (on the diagram below), which means you have to put servers where the blue dots are, many of which are in the ocean. Here's the diagram from the paper:
 
 
 
Mr. Slavin neatly sums this up by saying:
  

And it's not the money that's so interesting actually. It's what the money motivates, that  we're actually terraforming the Earth itself with this kind of algorithmic efficiency . And in that light, you go back and you look at Michael Najjar's ph</p><p>3 0.66453952 <a title="1263-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-23-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_23%2C_2013.html">1506 high scalability-2013-08-23-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 23, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The ever amazing   slime mold   is not the only way to solve complex compute problems without performing calculations. There is another:  soap film . Unfortunately for soap film it isn’t nearly as photogenic as slime mold, all we get are boring looking pictures, but the underlying idea is still fascinating and ten times less spooky.   As a quick introduction we’ll lean on Long Ouyang, who has really straightforward  explanation of how soap film works in   Approaching P=NP: Can Soap Bubbles Solve The Steiner Tree Problem In Polynomial  .  It’s computers, so playing the role of the motivating graph problem we have the   Steiner tree problem  , which Ouyang explains as:
  
  Find the minimum spanning tree for a bunch of vertices, given that you can add additional points. 

  
 Soap helps solve this problem because: 
  
  Soap, in water, acts a surfactant, which decreases the surface tension in water.  
  This acts to minimize the surface energy of the liquid.  
  This should minimize surf</p><p>4 0.62264401 <a title="1263-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-23-Scaling_your_cookie_recipes.html">390 high scalability-2008-09-23-Scaling your cookie recipes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This article on scaling cookie baking recipes showed up in one my key word alerts. Lots of weird things show up in alerts, but I really like cookies and the parallels were just so delicious. Scaling in the cookie baking world is:   the process of multiplying your recipe by many times to produce much more dough for many more cookies. It’s the difference between making enough dough in one batch to make two dozen cookies, or 2000 cookies.      Hey, pretty close to the website notion.  Yet as any good cook knows any scaled up recipe must be tweaked a little as things change at scale. Let's see what else we're supposed to do (quoted from the article):     Be Patient  - When making large batches of cookies, the most important thing that you have to remember is not to rush.   Use Fresh Ingredients  - This is always an important thing to keep in mind.    Don’t use as much leavening  - When you’re making a large batch of cookie dough, remember to scale down the amount of baking powder that you</p><p>5 0.51073772 <a title="1263-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-08-4_General_Core_Scalability_Patterns.html">897 high scalability-2010-09-08-4 General Core Scalability Patterns</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jesper Söderlund put together an excellent list of four general scalability patterns and four subpatterns in his post  Scalability patterns and an interesting story :
  
 
  Load distribution  - Spread the system load across multiple processing units                
 
  Load balancing / load sharing  - Spreading the load across many components with equal properties for handling the request 
  Partitioning  - Spreading the load across many components by routing an individual request to a component that owns that data specific           
 
  Vertical partitioning  - Spreading the load across the functional boundaries of a problem space, separate functions being handled by different processing units 
  Horizontal partitioning  - Spreading a single type of data element across many instances, according to some partitioning key, e.g. hashing the player id and doing a modulus operation, etc. Quite often referred to as sharding.

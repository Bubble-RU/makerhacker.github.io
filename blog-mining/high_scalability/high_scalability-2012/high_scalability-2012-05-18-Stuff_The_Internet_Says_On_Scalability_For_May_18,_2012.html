<p>Introduction: The abstract for the talk given by Bob Ippolito, co-founder and CTO of Mochi
Media, Inc:Building large systems on top of a traditional single-master RDBMS
data storage layer is no longer good enough. This talk explores the landscape
of new technologies available today to augment your data layer to improve
performance and reliability. Is your application a good fit for caches, bloom
filters, bitmap indexes, column stores, distributed key/value stores, or
document databases? Learn how they work (in theory and practice) and decide
for yourself.Bob does an excellent job highlighting different products and the
key concepts to understand when pondering the wide variety of new database
offerings. It's unlikely you'll be able to say oh, this is the database for me
after watching the presentation, but you will be much better informed on your
options. And I imagine slightly confused as to what to do :-)An interesting
observation in the talk is that the more robust products are internal to large</p><p>3 0.12421716 <a title="1247-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-20-How_Twitter_Improved_JVM_Performance_by_Reducing_GC_and_Faster_Memory_Allocation.html">1551 high scalability-2013-11-20-How Twitter Improved JVM Performance by Reducing GC and Faster Memory Allocation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nettyis a high-performance NIO(New IO) client server framework for Java that
Twitter uses internally as a protocol agonostic RPC system. Twitterfound some
problemswith Netty 3's memory management for buffer allocations beacause it
generated a lot of garbage during operation. When you send as many messages as
Twitter it creates a lot of GC pressure and the simple act of zero filling
newly allocated buffers consumed 50% of memory bandwidth. Netty 4 fixes this
situation with:Short-lived event objects, methods on long-lived channel
objects are used to handle I/O events.Secialized buffer allocator that uses
pool which implementsbuddy memory allocationandslab allocation.The result:5
times less frequent GC pauses: 45.5 vs. 9.2 times/min5 times less garbage
production: 207.11 vs 41.81 MiB/sThe buffer pool is much faster than JVM as
the size of the buffer increases. Some problems with smaller buffers.Given how
many services use the JVM in their messaging infrastructure and how many

Cloud Now Stores 339 Billion Objects. CERN also has anopen source

heritage: I feel somewhat sad that I have to put this truism out here: disks
are way more cost efficient, and if used properly can be used to facilitate
way more long-term products, not just real time data. Think Wikipedia without
history, think comments that disappear on old posts, together with old posts,
think all 404s you hit on various articles you remember from the past and want
to read. Building the web that lasts is completely different task from what
academia people imagine building the web is. What happens in real world if one
gets 2x efficiency gain? Twice more data can be stored, twice more data

<p>Introduction: Over the last several decades computer architects have been phenomenally
successful turning the transistor bounty provided by Moore's Law into chips
with ever increasing single-threaded performance. During many of these
successful years, however, many researchers paid scant attention to
multiprocessor work. Now as vendors turn to multicore chips, researchers are
reacting with more papers on multi-threaded systems. While this is good, we
are concerned that further work on single-thread performance will be
squashed.To help understand future high-level trade-offs, we develop a
corollary to Amdahl's Law for multicore chips [Hill & Marty, IEEE Computer
2008]. It models fixed chip resources for alternative designs that use
symmetric cores, asymmetric cores, or dynamic techniques that allow cores to
work together on sequential execution. Our results encourage multicore
designers to view performance of the entire chip rather than focus on core
efficiencies. Moreover, we observe that obtaining</p><p>2 0.93684942 <a title="1247-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-06-GigaOm_Structure_08_Conference_on_June_25th_in_San_Francisco.html">341 high scalability-2008-06-06-GigaOm Structure 08 Conference on June 25th in San Francisco</a></p>

look GigaOm's Structure 08 conference. The slate of speakers looks
appropriately interesting and San Francisco is truly magical this time of
year. High Scalability readers even get a price break is you use the HIGHSCALE

a good time. For a nice change of pace consider visitingMoMAnext door. Here's
a blurb on the conference:A reminder to our readers about Structure 08,

<p>Introduction: Neil Conwayfrom Berkeley CS is giving an advanced level talk ata meetup today
in San Francisco on a new paper: Logic and Lattices for Distributed
Programming \- extending set logic to support CRDT-style lattices. The
description of the meetup is probably the clearest introduction to the
paper:Developers are increasingly choosing datastores that sacrifice strong
consistency guarantees in exchange for improved performance and availability.
Unfortunately, writing reliable distributed programs without the benefit of
strong consistency can be very challenging. In this talk, I'll discuss work
from our group at UC Berkeley that aims to make it easier to write distributed
programs without relying on strong consistency. Bloom is a declarative
programming language for distributed computing, while CALM is an analysis
technique that identifies programs that are guaranteed to be eventually
consistent. I'll then discuss our recent work on extending CALM to support a
broader range of programs, drawin</p><p>same-blog 5 0.91677642 <a title="1247-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-18-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_18%2C_2012.html">1247 high scalability-2012-05-18-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 18, 2012</a></p>

  Tim Bell : You can't do transformation in transitional stages 
  @lleung : Also, we could really use a “high scalability” like blog for Enterprise IT to see the interesting stuff 
  xkcd : Functional programming combines the flexibility and power of abstract mathematics with the intuitive clarity of abstract mathematics. 
  @pbailis : That said, just because you can now build distributed transactions doesn't mean they'll be fast or work well during failures.

    ( Giant Hurricane on Saturn , here's one  in New Orleans )  
 
  
  1,966,080 cores : Time Warp synchronization protocol using up to 7.8M MPI tasks on 1,966,080 cores of the {Sequoia} Blue Gene/Q supercomputer system. 33 trillion events processed in 65 seconds yielding a peak event-rate in excess of 504 billion events/second using 120 racks of Sequoia. 
 Quotable Quotes:                             
 
  Thad Starner : the longer accessing a device exceeds 2s, the more its actually usage would decrease exponentially. Thus, he made a claim that wrist watch interface always sitting on one's wrist ready to use should be more successful than mobile phones which have to pulled out of the pocket.  
  @joedevon : We came for scalability but we stayed for agility #NoSQL 
  @jahmailay : "Our user base is exploding. I really wish we spent more time on scalability instead of features customers don't use." - Everybody, always.

<p>Introduction: When two titans of the early computing industry, Apple co-founder  Steve Wozniak  and Atari founder  Nolan Bushnell , had a chance to sit down for a chat at the  C2SV  conference last Friday, we learned how a little foresight and luck can decide futures.  
  Steve Wozniak's Success - Expandability       
 
 
Steve talked about how the Apple II was the primary source of revenue for Apple's first 10 years of life. The reason the Apple II could last so long was that it was expandable. It had  eight expansion slots  and the RAM was also expandable (starting at 4K). No computer at the time had this kind of flexibility or  expansion capabilities . Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs argued over keeping the Apple II open. Jobs wanted closed, Wozniak wanted open and fortunately Wozniak won.  In fact, the Apple II was completely open (those were the days). They published the complete specs before there was anything like a developer community. 
 
So even though the Apple III, Lisa, and the Macintosh al</p><p>same-blog 2 0.94067895 <a title="1339-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-12-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_October_12%2C_2012.html">1339 high scalability-2012-10-12-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For October 12, 2012</a></p>

  @adron : OH "What's the hello world of distributed systems?" "Twitter." 
  Mikael Ronstrom : A long career on distributed systems has learnt me that it is extremely important to do proper partitioning of data sets to achieve scalability on network level. But it is still extremely important to make each node in the distributed system as large as possible.

<p>Introduction: Hey, it's HighScalability time: 
  
 The Herokulypse. A cautionary tale of what can happen when scalability is left for later. Rap Genius created quite a stir ( reddit ,  Hacker News )  when they documented  high costs ($20K/month for 15 million monthly uniques) and poor performance (6 second average response times) using Heroku's  random routing mesh . The cause was tracked to queuing at the dyno level when the expectation was requests are routed to free dynos. Heroku admits  this is a problem . So poor load balancing combined with RoR single threading = poor performance, one that adding more dynos and spending more money won't necessarily help. While it seems clear Heroku didn't make this aspect of their system crystal clear, the incident has generated a lot of teaching moments, if you slog through it all. This is a developing story.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Rodrigo Guzman, CTO of  iDoneThis , which makes status reporting happen at your company with the lightest possible touch. 
 
 iDoneThis  is a simple management application that emails your team at the end of every day to ask, "What'd you get done today?"  Just reply with a few lines of what you got done. The following morning everyone on your team gets a digest with what the team accomplished the previous day to keep everyone in the loop and kickstart another awesome day.
 
Before we launched, we built iDoneThis over a weekend in the most rudimentary way possible.  I kid you not, we sent the first few batches of daily emails using the BCC field of a Gmail inbox.  The upshot is that we’ve had users on the site from Day 3 of its existence on.
 
We’ve gone from launch in January 2011 when we sent hundreds of emails out per day by hand to sending out over 1 million emails and handling over 200,000 incoming emails per month.  In total, customers have recorded over 1.</p><p>5 0.91739482 <a title="1339-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-26-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_October_26%2C_2012.html">1348 high scalability-2012-10-26-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For October 26, 2012</a></p>

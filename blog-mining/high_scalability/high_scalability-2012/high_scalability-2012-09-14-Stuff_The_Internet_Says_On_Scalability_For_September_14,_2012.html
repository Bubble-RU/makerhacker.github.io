<p>Introduction: With Amazon     announcing new High I/O 2TB SSD instances    the age of SSD has almost arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on demand rate the   price per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:   27 cents ($27K/100K IOPS) per vs    $1.25 for disk   .     With the obvious benefits of giant SSD machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it’s interesting to consider: what architecture decisions might you make differently in the future? 
   More Headroom for Vertical Scaling Simplifies Everything   
 The beauty of higher hardware performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This has always been the allure of    vertical scaling    and is well realized by SSDs through a combination of high throughput, low latencies, and just as important, high densities.

<p>Introduction: With Amazon     announcing new High I/O 2TB SSD instances    the age of SSD has almost arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on demand rate the   price per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:   27 cents ($27K/100K IOPS) per vs    $1.25 for disk   .     With the obvious benefits of giant SSD machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it’s interesting to consider: what architecture decisions might you make differently in the future? 
   More Headroom for Vertical Scaling Simplifies Everything   
 The beauty of higher hardware performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This has always been the allure of    vertical scaling    and is well realized by SSDs through a combination of high throughput, low latencies, and just as important, high densities.

<p>Introduction: Digg has been researching ways to scale our database infrastructure for some time now. We’ve adopted a  traditional vertically partitioned master-slave  configuration with MySQL, and also investigated sharding MySQL with  IDDB . Ultimately, these solutions left us wanting. In the case of the traditional architecture, the lack of redundancy on the write masters is painful, and both approaches have significant management overhead to keep running.
 
Since it was already necessary to abandon data normalization and consistency to make these approaches work, we felt comfortable looking at more exotic, non-relational data stores. After considering HBase, Hypertable, Cassandra, Tokyo Cabinet/Tyrant, Voldemort, and Dynomite, we settled on  Cassandra .
 
Each system has its own strengths and weaknesses, but Cassandra has a good blend of everything. It offers column-oriented data storage, so you have a bit more structure than plain key/value stores. It operates in a distributed, highly available,</p><p>2 0.95307934 <a title="1322-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-16-Seven_Signs_You_May_Need_a_NoSQL_Database.html">779 high scalability-2010-02-16-Seven Signs You May Need a NoSQL Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: While exploring deep into some dusty old library stacks, I dug up Nostradamus' long lost  NoSQL  codex. What are the chances? Strangely, it also gave the plot to the next Dan Brown novel, but I left that out for reasons of sanity. About NoSQL, here is what Nosty (his friends call him Nosty) predicted are the signs you may need a NoSQL database...
  
  You noticed a lot of your database fields are really serialized complex objects in disguise . Why bother with a RDBMS at all then? Storing serialized objects in a relational database is like being on the pill while trying to get pregnant, a bit counter productive. Just use a schemaless database from the start. 
  Using a standard query language has become too confining . You just want to be free. SQL is so easy, so convenient, and so standard, it's really  not a challenge  anymore. You need to be different. Then NoSQL is for you. Each has their own completely different  query mechanism .

<p>Introduction: In a strange case of synchronicity, Google just published  Instant Previews: Under the hood , a very well written blog post by Matías Pelenur of the Instant Previews team, giving some fascinating inside details on how Google implemented  Instant Previews . It's syncronicty because I had just posted  Strategy: Biggest Performance Impact Is To Reduce The Number Of HTTP Requests  and one of the major ideas behind the design Instant Previews is to reduce the number of HTTP requests through a few well chosen tricks. Cosmic!
 
Some of what Google does to reduce HTTP requests:
  
  Data URIs , which are are base64 encodings of image data, are used instead of static images that are served from the server. This means the whole preview can be pieced together from image slices in one request as both the data and the image are returned in the same request. Google found that  even though base64 encoding adds about 33% to the size of the image, tests showed that gzip-compressed data URIs are compara</p><p>5 0.92539597 <a title="1322-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-18-Scalability_Perspectives_%232%3A_Van_Jacobson_%E2%80%93_Content-Centric_Networking.html">446 high scalability-2008-11-18-Scalability Perspectives #2: Van Jacobson – Content-Centric Networking</a></p>

He still hopes that someday something will start to make sense.    Scaling the Internet – Does the Net needs an upgrade?

<p>Introduction: Now that we have the    C10K concurrent connection problem    licked, how do we level up and support 10 million concurrent connections? Impossible you say. Nope, systems right now are delivering 10 million concurrent connections using techniques that are as radical as they may be unfamiliar. 
   To learn how it’s done we turn to    Robert Graham   , CEO of Errata Security, and his absolutely fantastic talk at    Shmoocon 2013    called    C10M Defending The Internet At Scale   . 
  Robert has a brilliant way of framing the problem that I’ve never heard of before. He starts with a little bit of history, relating how Unix wasn’t originally designed to be a general server OS, it was designed to be a control system for a telephone network. It was the telephone network that actually transported the data so there was a clean separation between the control plane and the data plane. The  problem is we now use Unix servers as part of the data plane , which we shouldn’t do at all.

There has been a lot of speculation and assumptions around whether  PRISM  exists and if it is cost effective. I don't know whether it exists or not, but I can tell you if it could be built.
 
Short answer: It can.
 
If you believe it would be impossible for someone with access to a social "datapool" to find out more about you (if they really want to track you down) in the tsunami of data, you need to think again.
 
Devices, apps and websites are transmitting data. Lots of data. The questions are could the data compiled and searched and how costly would it be to search for your targeted data. (hint: It is not $4.56 trillion).
 
Let's experiment and try to build PRISM by ourselves with a few assumptions:
  
  Assumption 1 : We have all the appropriate "data connectors" that will provide us with data. 
  Assumption 2 : These connectors provide dire</p><p>4 0.12818399 <a title="1362-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-08-Medialets_Architecture_-__Defeating_the_Daunting_Mobile_Device_Data_Deluge.html">1000 high scalability-2011-03-08-Medialets Architecture -  Defeating the Daunting Mobile Device Data Deluge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mobile developers have a huge scaling problem ahead: doing something useful with massive continuous streams of telemetry data from millions and millions of devices. This is a really good problem to have. It means smartphone sales are finally fulfilling their destiny:  slaughtering PCs  in the sales arena. And it also means mobile devices aren't just containers for simple standalone apps anymore, they are becoming the dominant interface to giant backend systems.
    
While developers are now rocking mobile development on the client side, their next challenge is how to code those tricky backend bits. A company facing those same exact problems right now is  Medialets , a mobile rich media ad platform. What they do is help publishers create high quality interactive ads, though for our purposes their ad stuff isn't that interesting. What I did find really interesting about their system is how they are tackling the problem of defeating the mobile device data deluge.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Jamie Hall, Co-founder & CTO of  MocoSpace , describing the architecture for their mobile social network. This is a timely architecture to learn from as it combines several hot trends: it is very large, mobile, and social. What they think is especially cool about their system is: how it optimizes for device/browser fragmentation on the mobile Web; their multi-tiered,  read/write, local/distributed caching system; selecting PostgreSQL over MySQL as a relational DB that can scale.
 
MocoSpace is a mobile social network, with 12 million members and 3 billion page views a month, which makes it one of the most highly trafficked mobile Websites in the US. Members access the site mainly from their mobile phone Web browser, ranging from high end smartphones to lower end devices, as well as the Web. Activities on the site include customizing profiles, chat, instant messaging, music, sharing photos & videos, games, eCards and blogs.

<p>Introduction: My name is  Russell Sullivan , I am the author of AlchemyDB: a highly flexible NoSQL/SQL/DocumentStore/GraphDB-datastore built on top of redis. I have spent the last several years trying to find a way to sanely house multiple datastore-genres under one roof while (almost paradoxically) pushing performance to its limits.    I recently joined the NoSQL company    Aerospike    (formerly Citrusleaf) with the goal of incrementally grafting AlchemyDB’s flexible data-modeling capabilities onto Aerospike’s high-velocity horizontally-scalable key-value data-fabric. We recently completed a peak-performance    TPS optimization project   : starting at 200K TPS, pushing to the recent community edition launch at 500K TPS, and finally arriving at our 2012 goal:    1M TPS on $5K hardware   .

 Good idea:  Open The Index And Speed Up The Internet .  SmugMug estimates 50%  of their CPU is spent serving crawler robots. Having a common meta-data repository wouldn't prevent search engines from having their own special sauce. Then the problem becomes one of syncing data between repositories and processing change events. A generous soul could even offer a shared MapReduce service over the data. Now that would  speed up the internet . 
 Scaling Achievements:  YouTube Sees 3 Billion Views per Day ;  Twitter produces a sustained feed of 35 Mb per second ;  companies processing billions of APIs calls  (Twitter, Netflix, Amazon, NPR, Google, Facebook, eBay, Bing);  Astronomers Identify the Farthest Object Ever Observed, 13.14 Billion Light Years Away

<p>Introduction: Here's a really good article in the Communications of the ACM on reducing network packet processing overhead by redesigning the network stack:  Revisiting Network I/O APIs: The Netmap Framework  by  Luigi Rizzo . As commodity networking performance increases operating systems need to keep up or all those CPUs will go to waste. How do they make this happen?

 


Abstract:

 

Today 10-gigabit interfaces are used more and more in datacenters and servers. On these links, packets flow as fast as one every 67.2 nanoseconds, yet modern operating systems can take 10-20 times longer just to move one packet between the wire and the application. We can do much better, not with more powerful hardware but by revising architectural decisions made long ago regarding the design of device drivers and network stacks.


The netmap framework is a promising step in this direction. Thanks to a careful design and the engineering of a new packet I/O API, netmap eliminates much unnecessary overhead and moves</p><p>6 0.76793629 <a title="1362-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-13-The_Secret_to_10_Million_Concurrent_Connections_-The_Kernel_is_the_Problem%2C_Not_the_Solution.html">1456 high scalability-2013-05-13-The Secret to 10 Million Concurrent Connections -The Kernel is the Problem, Not the Solution</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It looks like in the near future I'll have a chance to interview the Elastra CEO. Elastra provides standard   databases--MySQL, EnterpriseDB and PostgreSQL-- on top of EC2 and S3. They are selling aggressive pricing, expandable and contactable database resource usage in response to demand, and a simple management and operations interface to well known databases deployed in a cloud. Elastra could be an important option for developers looking for a more traditional cloudy database.      I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions for questions you would like answered? What would you like to know about their service? What are you looking for in a cloudy database? What would stop you from adopting it or what would make you decide to adopt it? Any ideas you have would help a lot and will probably be better than anything I have.</p><p>2 0.93372655 <a title="1362-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-01-8_Commonly_Used_Scalable_System_Design_Patterns.html">951 high scalability-2010-12-01-8 Commonly Used Scalable System Design Patterns</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ricky Ho  in  Scalable System Design Patterns  has created a great list of scalability patterns along with very well done explanatory graphics. A summary of the patterns are:
  
  Load Balancer  - a dispatcher determines which worker instance will handle a request based on different policies. 
  Scatter and Gather  - a dispatcher multicasts requests to all workers in a pool. Each worker will compute a local result and send it back to the dispatcher, who will consolidate them into a single response and then send back to the client. 
  Result Cache  - a dispatcher will first lookup if the request has been made before and try to find the previous result to return, in order to save the actual execution. 
  Shared Space  - all workers monitors information from the shared space and contributes partial knowledge back to the blackboard. The information is continuously enriched until a solution is reached. 
  Pipe and Filter  - all workers connected by pipes across which data flows.

<p>Introduction: Over the years I've accumulated quite a rag tag collection of personal systems scattered wide across a galaxy of different servers. For the past month I've been on a quest to rationalize this conglomeration by moving everything to a managed service of one kind or another. The goal: lift a load of worry from my mind. I like to do my own stuff my self so I learn something and have control. Control always comes with headaches and it was time for a little aspirin. As part of the process GAE came in handy as a host for a few Twitter related scripts I couldn't manage to run  anywhere else. I recoded my simple little scripts into Python/GAE and learned a lot in the process.       In the move I exported HighScalability from a VPS and imported it into a shared hosting service. I could never quite configure Apache and MySQL well enough that they wouldn't spike memory periodically and crash the VPS. And since a memory crash did not automatically restarted it was unacceptable. I also wrote a scrip</p><p>4 0.92917287 <a title="1362-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-25-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_25%2C_2012.html">1252 high scalability-2012-05-25-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 25, 2012</a></p>

  @ammeep : Great discussion on data scalability and caching approaches at ‪#yellowcamp‬ "a cache is like your best mate you can never trust" 
  @adrianco : Why do OpenStack talks I go to always focus on the story of how they did it rather than how it works and what it does for me? ‪#Gluecon‬. 
  Cliff Moon : Incuriosity killed the infrastructure. 
  @seldo2 : "NoSQL is a land grab against the DBAs the prevent you from doing shit" - @monkchips ‪#gluecon‬ 
  @mjasay : Netflix's @atseitlin: Build for fail, not for scale. Focus on service-level metrics, not individual servers, when monitoring system health

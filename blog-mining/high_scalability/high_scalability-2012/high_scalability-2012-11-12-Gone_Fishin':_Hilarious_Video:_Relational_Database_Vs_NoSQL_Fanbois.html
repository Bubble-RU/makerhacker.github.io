are so many more gems like that.Thanks to Alex Popescu for posting this on

think you are a f*cking Google and architect and parrot slogans like Web Scale
and Sharding but you have no idea what the f*ck you are talking about. There
are so many more gems like that.Thanks to Alex Popescu for posting this on
MongoDB is Web Scale. Whoever made this deserves a Webby.</p><p>3 0.64533722 <a title="1357-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-29-Presentations%3A_MySQL_Conference_%26_Expo_2009.html">586 high scalability-2009-04-29-Presentations: MySQL Conference & Expo 2009</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I try to keep this blog targeted and on topic. So even though I may be
thankful for thesongof the tinniestsparrowatsunrise, I'll save you from all
that. It's hard to tie scalability and thegiving of thankstogether, especially
as it sometimes occurs to me that this blog may be a self-indulgent waste of
time. But I think I found a sentiment in A New THEORY of AWESOMENESS and
MIRACLES byJames Bridlethat manages to marry the topic of this blog and giving
thanks meaningfully together:I distrust commercial definitions of innovation,
and particularly of awesomeness. It's an overused term. When I think of
awesomeness, I want something awe-inspiring, vast and mind-expanding.So I
started thinking about things that I think are awesome, or miraculous, and for
me, it kept coming back to scale and complexity.We're not actually very good

metaphors and examples. Douglas Adams writes somewhere about how big the

<p>Introduction: Abstract--This paper presents the architecture andcharacteristics of a memory
database intended to be used as acache engine for web applications. Primary
goals of this databaseare speed and efficiency while running on SMP systems
withseveral CPU cores (four and more). A secondary goal is thesupport for
simple metadata structures associated with cacheddata that can aid in
efficient use of the cache. Due to these goals,some data structures and
algorithms normally associated withthis field of computing needed to be
adapted to the newenvironment.</p><p>6 0.45229438 <a title="1357-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-13-Strategy%3A_Saving_Your_Butt_With_Deferred_Deletes.html">809 high scalability-2010-04-13-Strategy: Saving Your Butt With Deferred Deletes</a></p>

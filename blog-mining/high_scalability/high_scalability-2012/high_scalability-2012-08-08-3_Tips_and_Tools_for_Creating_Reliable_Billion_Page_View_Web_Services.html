<p>Introduction: Microsoft SQL Server 2008 incorporates the tools and technologies that are
necessary to implement relational databases, reporting systems, and data
warehouses of enterprise scale, and provides optimal performance and
responsiveness.With SQL Server 2008, you can take advantage of the latest
hardware technologies while scaling up your servers to support server
consolidation. SQL Server 2008 also enables you to scale out your largest data
solutions.This white paper describes the performance and scalability
capabilities of Microsoft速 SQL Server速 2008 and explains how you can use these
capabilities to:* Optimize performance for any size of database with the tools
and features that are available for the database engine, analysis services,
reporting services, and integration services.* Scale up your servers to take
full advantage of new hardware capabilities.* Scale out your database
environment to optimize responsiveness and to move your data closer to your
users.Read the entire article abou</p><p>3 0.092410073 <a title="1301-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-14-The_Azure_Outage%3A_Time_Is_a_SPOF%2C_Leap_Day_Doubly_So.html">1209 high scalability-2012-03-14-The Azure Outage: Time Is a SPOF, Leap Day Doubly So</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Steve Newman, co-founder of Writely (Google Docs),
tech lead on the Paxos-based synchronous replication in Megastore, and founder
of cloud service providerScalyr.com.Microsoft's Azure service suffered a
widely publicized outage on February 28th / 29th. Microsoft recently published
an excellentpostmortem. For anyone trying to run a high-availability service,
this incident can teach several important lessons.The central lesson is that,
no matter how much work you put into redundancy, problems will arise. Murphy
is strong and, I might say, creative; things go wrong. So preventative
measures are important, but how you react to problems is just as important.
It's interesting to review the Azure incident in this light.The postmortem is
worth reading in its entirety, but here's a quick summary: each time Azure
launches a new VM, it creates a "transfer certificate" to secure
communications with that VM. There was a bug in the code that determines the
certificate expirat</p><p>4 0.090084672 <a title="1301-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-05-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_5%2C_2011.html">1093 high scalability-2011-08-05-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 5, 2011</a></p>

VP of Technology and founding team of Turntable.fm, shares techniques he used
to build and quickly scale his startups. The post is very well written and a
must read. Here are the essentials:Keep it simple.Build API's before making
the website or mobile apps. Keep interfaces small and single-purpose. Get it
right.Build in automated tests from the start. Create function tests, module
level tests, and full integration tests. Run tests on every commit. No new
code written while bugs exist.Don't hide power.UsePebblesto write bug-free
Javascript, a library to create complicated AJAX interactions by writing 0
javascript by adding a few extra HTML tags to code.Use procedure arguments to
provide flexibility in an interface.Pass functions instead of parameters to
support complicated scenarios. For example, a filter function return a
boolean.Leave it to the client.Keep the server simple and move as much

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byNick Burling, VP of Product Management
ofBluestripe.Readers of High Scalability know are well versed in performance
optimization techniques. Reverse proxies, Varnish, Redis -- you hear about
them daily. But what you may not realize is that one of the oldest
technologies in your stack can be one of your biggest bottlenecks: DNS.People
don't spend a lot of time thinking about DNS. It's not sexy. It's an
infrastructure service, and it's just supposed to work.At BlueStripe, we work
with many teams running applications that support millions of web requests a
day. We keep seeing DNS delays and errors that the platform operations team
never knows about. It's so common we've start calling it theHidden DNS
Tax.What is the Hidden DNS Tax?The Hidden DNS Tax is a hard-to-see performance
hit your users take from DNS timeouts and errors in your back-end
architecture. We've seen it bring down the main web application for a Fortune
10 company.A DNS lookup can fail, the user gets</p><p>3 0.70663375 <a title="1301-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-30-Log_Everything_All_the_Time.html">77 high scalability-2007-08-30-Log Everything All the Time</a></p>
<p>Introduction: breakThis JoelOnSoftwarethreadasks the age old question of what and how to
log. The usual trace/error/warning/info advice is totally useless in a large
scale distributed system. Instead, you need tolog everything all the timeso
you can solve problems that have already happened across a potentially huge
range of servers. Yes, it can be done.To see why the typical logging approach
is broken, imagine this scenario: Your site has been up and running great for
weeks. No problems. A foreshadowing beeper goes off at 2AM. It seems some
users can no longer add comments to threads. Then you hear the debugging
deathknell: it's an intermittent problem and customers are pissed. Fix it.
Now.So how are you going to debug this? The monitoring system doesn't show any
obvious problems or errors. You quickly post a comment and it works fine. This
won't be easy. So you think. Commenting involves a bunch of servers and
networks. There's the load balancer, spam filter, web server, database server,
caching s</p><p>4 0.67817414 <a title="1301-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-11-The_interactive_cloud.html">702 high scalability-2009-09-11-The interactive cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How many times have you been called in the middle of the night by your
operation guys telling you that your application throws some odd red alerts?
How many times did you found out that when those issues happens you don't have
enough information to analyze this incident? have you tried to increase the
log level just to find out that your problem became even worse - now your
application throws tons of information in a continues basis most of which is
complete garbage...The current separation between the way we implement our
application and the way we manage it leads to many of this ridicules
situations. Cloud makes those things even worse.Inthis posti suggest an
alternative approach. Why don't we run our application the way we run our
business? I refer to this approach as the "interactive cloud" where our
application behaves just like our project team and the operations just like
our managers. As with our business our application would need to take more
responsibility to the way it runs</p><p>5 0.65910667 <a title="1301-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-21-Processing_100_Million_Pixels_a_Day_-_Small_Amounts_of_Contention_Cause_Big_Problems_at_Scale.html">1390 high scalability-2013-01-21-Processing 100 Million Pixels a Day - Small Amounts of Contention Cause Big Problems at Scale</a></p>

purchases.Several weeks ago, we came into the office one morning to find every
server alarm going off. Pixel log processing was behind by 8 hours and not
making headway. Checking the logs, we discovered that a big client had come
online during the night and was giving us 10 times more traffic than we were
originally told to expect. I wouldn't say we panicked, but the office was
certainly more jittery than usual. Over the next several hours, though, thanks
both to foresight and quick thinking, we were able to scale up to handle the
added load and clear the backlog to return log processing to a steady state.At
Korrelate, we deploytracking pixels, also known beacons or web bugs, that our
partners use to send us information about their users. These tiny web objects
contain no visible content, but may include transparent 1 by 1 gifs or

<p>Introduction: Amir Salihefendic, founder of Todoist and Wedoist, inHow to create very
reliable web services, has written an insightful post on strategies for
creating reliable web services along with the tools needed to make it
happen.Realtime monitor everything. Create a clear picture of what's going on
at any time both past and present. Keep a log of errors and key application
metrics. Visualize response times and other metrics for every computer in your
network. Tools:statsd,Graphite,Pingdom,Cacti,Nagios.Be proactive. Don't
optimize prematurely, but don't wait to optimize when in a crisis situation.
Anticipate problems before they happen by monitoring and completely
understanding your system. Think now about how to scale your system if load
increases by several orders of magnitude.Be notified when crashes happen. Use
tools likePingdomandcrash_houndto send notifications when problems do
occur.While not secrets in any sense, thearticleis well written and has many
useful details. Worth a look.</p><p>2 0.87137759 <a title="1301-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-29-Gone_Fishin%27_Two.html">1350 high scalability-2012-10-29-Gone Fishin' Two</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Under the philosophy thatthe best method to analyse spam is to become a
spammer, this absolutely fascinating paper recounts how a team of UC Berkely
researchers went under cover to infiltrate a spam network. Part CSI, part
Mission Impossible, and part MacGyver, the team hijacked the botnet so that
their code was actually part of the dark network itself. Once inside they
figured out the architecture and protocols of the botnet and how many sales
they were able to tally. Truly elegant work.Two different spam campaigns were
run on aStormbotnet network of 75,800 zombie computers. Storm is a peer-to-
peer botnet that uses spam to creep its tentacles through the world wide
computer network. One of the campains distributed viruses in order to recruit
new bots into the network. This is normally accomplished by enticing people to
download email attachments. An astonishing one in ten people downloaded the
executable and ran it, which means we won't run out of zombies soon. The
downloaded compone</p><p>4 0.85871923 <a title="1301-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-30-Gone_Fishin%27.html">1128 high scalability-2011-09-30-Gone Fishin'</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my blogpostWorking With Large Data Sets...For the past
18 months I've moved from working on the SMTP proxy to working on our other
systems, all of which make use of the data we collect from each connection.
It's a fair amount of data and it can be up to 2Kb in size for each
connection. Our servers receive approximately 1000 of these pieces of data per
second, which is fairly sustained due to our global distribution of customers.
If you compare that toTwitter's peak of 3,283 tweets per second (maximum of
140 characters), you can see it's not a small amount of data that we are
dealing with here.I recently set out to scientifically prove the benefits of
throttling, which is our technology for slowing down connections in order to
detect spambots, who are kind enough to disconnect quite quickly when they see
a slow connection. Due to the nature of the data we had, I needed to work with
a long range of data to show evidence that an IP that appeared on Spamhaus had

<p>Introduction: Now that we have theC10K concurrent connection problemlicked, how do we level
up and support 10 million concurrent connections? Impossible you say. Nope,
systems right now are delivering 10 million concurrent connections using
techniques that are as radical as they may be unfamiliar.To learn how it's
done we turn toRobert Graham, CEO of Errata Security, and his absolutely
fantastic talk atShmoocon 2013calledC10M Defending The Internet At
Scale.Robert has a brilliant way of framing the problem that I've never heard
of before. He starts with a little bit of history, relating how Unix wasn't
originally designed to be a general server OS, it was designed to be a control
system for a telephone network. It was the telephone network that actually
transported the data so there was a clean separation between the control plane
and the data plane. Theproblem is we now use Unix servers as part of the data
plane, which we shouldn't do at all. If we were designing a kernel for
handling one applicati</p><p>3 0.23132776 <a title="1213-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-19-Is_it_time_to_get_rid_of_the_Linux_OS_model_in_the_cloud%3F.html">1177 high scalability-2012-01-19-Is it time to get rid of the Linux OS model in the cloud?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: My name isRussell Sullivan, I am the author of AlchemyDB: a highly flexible
NoSQL/SQL/DocumentStore/GraphDB-datastore built on top of redis. I have spent
the last several years trying to find a way to sanely house multiple
datastore-genres under one roof while (almost paradoxically) pushing
performance to its limits.I recently joined the NoSQL
companyAerospike(formerly Citrusleaf) with the goal of incrementally grafting
AlchemyDB's flexible data-modeling capabilities onto Aerospike's high-velocity
horizontally-scalable key-value data-fabric. We recently completed a peak-
performanceTPS optimization project: starting at 200K TPS, pushing to the
recent community edition launch at 500K TPS, and finally arriving at our 2012
goal:1M TPS on $5K hardware.Getting to one million over-the-wire client-server

<p>Introduction: You might think major Internet companies have a latency, availability, and
bandwidth advantage because they can afford expensive dedicated point-to-point
private line networks between their data centers. And you would be right. It's
a great advantage. Or it at least it was a great advantage. Cost is the great
equalizer and companies are now scrambling for ways to cut costs. Many of the
most recognizable Internet companies are moving to IP VPNs (Virtual Private
Networks) as a much cheaper alternative to private lines. This is a strategy
you can effectively use too.This trend has historical precedent in the data
center. In the same way leading edge companies moved early to virtualize their
data centers, leading edge companies are now virtualizing their networks using
IP VPNs to build inexpensive private networks over a shared public network. In
kindergarten we learned sharing was polite, it turns out sharing can also save
a lot of money in both the data center and on the network.The line</p><p>6 0.11424159 <a title="1213-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-27-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_27%2C_2011.html">1048 high scalability-2011-05-27-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 27, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Looks interesting...Abstract:Today's data centers may contain tens of
thousands of computers with significant aggregate bandwidth requirements. The
network architecture typically consists of a tree of routing and switching
elements with progressively more specialized and expensive equipment moving up
the network hierarchy. Unfortunately, even when deploying the highest-end IP
switches/routers, resulting topologies may only support 50% of the aggregate
bandwidth available at the edge of the network, while still incurring
tremendous cost. Nonuniform bandwidth among data center nodes complicates
application design and limits overall system performance.In this paper, we
show how to leverage largely commodity Ethernet switches to support the full
aggregate bandwidth of clusters consisting of tens of thousands of elements.
Similar to how clusters of commodity computers have largely replaced more
specialized SMPs and MPPs, we argue that appropriately architected and
interconnected commodity s</p><p>4 0.74373716 <a title="1213-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-19-Is_it_time_to_get_rid_of_the_Linux_OS_model_in_the_cloud%3F.html">1177 high scalability-2012-01-19-Is it time to get rid of the Linux OS model in the cloud?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In the scalability is specialization department here is an interesting paper
presented atHotNets '13on high performance networking: Network Stack
Specialization for Performance.The idea is generalizing a service so it fits
in the kernel comes at a high performance cost. So move TCP into user space.
The result is a web server with ~3.5x the throughput of Nginx "while
experiencing low CPU utilization, linear scaling on multicore systems, and
saturating current NIC hardware."Here's a good description of the paper
publishedon Layer 9:Traditionally, servers and OSes have been built to be
general purpose. However now we have a high degree of specialization. In fact,
in a big web service, you might have thousands of machines dedicated to one
function. Therefore, there's scope for specialization. This paper looks at a
specific opportunity in that space. Network stacks today are good for high
throughput with large transfers, but not small files (which are common in web
browsing).

<p>Introduction: Here's a really good article in the Communications of the ACM on reducing
network packet processing overhead by redesigning the network stack:
Revisiting Network I/O APIs: The Netmap Framework by Luigi Rizzo. As commodity
networking performance increases operating systems need to keep up or all
those CPUs will go to waste. How do they make this happen? Abstract:Today
10-gigabit interfaces are used more and more in datacenters and servers. On
these links, packets flow as fast as one every 67.2 nanoseconds, yet modern
operating systems can take 10-20 times longer just to move one packet between
the wire and the application. We can do much better, not with more powerful
hardware but by revising architectural decisions made long ago regarding the
design of device drivers and network stacks.The netmap framework is a
promising step in this direction. Thanks to a careful design and the
engineering of a new packet I/O API, netmap eliminates much unnecessary
overhead and moves traffic up to 40</p><p>3 0.8189193 <a title="1213-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-27-PlentyOfFish_Update_-_6_Billion_Pageviews_and_32_Billion_Images_a_Month.html">1164 high scalability-2011-12-27-PlentyOfFish Update - 6 Billion Pageviews and 32 Billion Images a Month</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Facebook has been teasing us. While many of their recentacquisitionshave been
surprising, shocking is the only word adequately describing Facebook's5 day
whirlwind acquisitionofOculus, immersive virtual reality visionaries, for a
now paltry sounding $2 billion.Thebacklashis a pandemic, jumping acrosssocial
networkswith the speed only a meme powered by the directly unaffected can
generate.For more than 30 years VR has been the dream burning in the heart of
every science fiction fan. Now that this future might finally be here,
Facebook's ownage makes it seem like a wonderful and hopeful timeline has been
choked off, killing the Metaverse before it even had a chance to begin.For the
many who voted for an open future with theirKickstarter dollars, there's a
deep and personal sense of betrayal, despite Facebook's promise to leave
Oculus alone. The intensity of the reaction is because Oculus matters to
people. It's new, it's different, it creates a better future. It's important

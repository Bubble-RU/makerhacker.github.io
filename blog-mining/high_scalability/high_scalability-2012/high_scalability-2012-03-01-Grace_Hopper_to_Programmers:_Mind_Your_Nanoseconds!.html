<p>Introduction: Colin Scott   , a Berkeley researcher, updated Jeff Dean’s famous    Numbers Everyone Should Know    with his    Latency Numbers Every Programmer Should Know    interactive graphic. The interactive aspect is cool because it has a slider that let’s you see numbers back from as early as 1990 to the far far future of 2020.  
 
Colin explained his  motivation for updating the numbers :
  The other day, a friend mentioned a latency number to me, and I realized that it was an order of magnitude smaller than what I had memorized from Jeff’s talk. The problem, of course, is that hardware performance increases exponentially! After some digging, I actually found that the numbers Jeff quotes are over a decade old

<p>Introduction: Here's a really good article in the Communications of the ACM on reducing network packet processing overhead by redesigning the network stack:  Revisiting Network I/O APIs: The Netmap Framework  by  Luigi Rizzo . As commodity networking performance increases operating systems need to keep up or all those CPUs will go to waste. How do they make this happen?

 


Abstract:

 

Today 10-gigabit interfaces are used more and more in datacenters and servers. On these links, packets flow as fast as one every 67.2 nanoseconds, yet modern operating systems can take 10-20 times longer just to move one packet between the wire and the application. We can do much better, not with more powerful hardware but by revising architectural decisions made long ago regarding the design of device drivers and network stacks.


The netmap framework is a promising step in this direction. Thanks to a careful design and the engineering of a new packet I/O API, netmap eliminates much unnecessary overhead and moves</p><p>5 0.071138695 <a title="1202-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-13-Snabb_Switch_-_Skip_the_OS_and_Get_40_million_Requests_Per_Second_in_Lua.html">1595 high scalability-2014-02-13-Snabb Switch - Skip the OS and Get 40 million Requests Per Second in Lua</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Snabb Switch  - a toolkit for solving novel problems in networking. If you are building a new packet-processing network appliance then you can use Snabb Switch to get the job done more quickly.
 
Here's a great impassioned overview from  erichocean :
  Or, you could just avoid the OS altogether:  https://github.com/SnabbCo/snabbswitch    

Our current engineering target is 1 million writes/sec and > 10 million reads/sec on top of an architecture similar to that, on a single box, to our fully transactional, MVCC database (write do not block reads, and vice versa) that runs in the same process (a la SQLite), which we've also merged with our application code and our caching tier, so we're down to—literally—a single process for what would have been at least three separate tiers in a traditional setup.


The result is that we had to move to measuring request latency in microseconds exclusively. The architecture (without additional application-specific processing) supports a wire-to-wire mes</p><p>6 0.054455008 <a title="1202-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-13-Busting_4_Modern_Hardware_Myths_-_Are_Memory%2C_HDDs%2C_and_SSDs_Really_Random_Access%3F.html">1475 high scalability-2013-06-13-Busting 4 Modern Hardware Myths - Are Memory, HDDs, and SSDs Really Random Access?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: My favorite kind of histories are those told from an insider's perspective. The story of Richard the Lionheart is full of great battles and dynastic intrigue. The story of one of his soldiers, not so much. Yet the soldiers' story, as someone who has experienced the real consequences of decisions made and actions taken, is more revealing.
 
We get such a history in  Chat Wars , a wonderful article written by David Auerbach, who in 1998 worked at Microsoft on MSN Messenger Service, Microsoft’s instant messaging app (for a related story see  The Rise and Fall of AIM, the Breakthrough AOL Never Wanted ).
 
It's as if Herodotus visited Microsoft and wrote down his experiences. It has that same sort of conversational tone, insightful on-the-ground observations, and facts no outsider might ever believe.
 
Much of the article is a play-by-play account of the cat and mouse game David plays changing Messenger to track AOL's Instant Messenger protocol changes.

<p>Introduction: An Analysis of Linux Scalability to Many Cores , by a number of MIT researchers, is a refreshingly practical paper on what it takes to scale Linux and common applications like Exim, memcached, Apache, PostgreSQL, gmake, Psearchy, and MapReduce to run on 48 core systems. A very timely paper given moderately massive multicore systems are reportedly the near future of computing.
 
This paper must have taken a lot of work. They both tracked down bottlenecks in a number of applications and the Linux kernel and they also tried to fix them. Modestly speaking the authors said they made "modest" changes to the kernel and applications, but there's nothing modest about what they did. It's excellent work.
 
After the next bit, which is the abstract, there is a list of the problems they found and how they fixed them.

<p>Introduction: Hello all,     does anyone have experience in scaling a european website to china?     The main problem in china is the internet connectivity to websites outside china, that means latency and packetloss (and perhaps filtering) make things difficult.     The options I see are:     1. Host you application in china, but where? I haven't got a answer from any chinese ISP I contacted. On the other hand I don't really want to host in china.     2. Build your own CDN. Wikipedia shows how it goes. Get a bunch of machines (but where? see point 1) put squid on them, implement intelligent cache invalidation and you're set. But where can I get machines in china? Where do I need them in china? There are soe big isps with limited peering capability, so I'd need servers in every network.     3. Get professional CDN services. Akamai, ChinaCache, CDNetworks, etc etc.. They all provide services in china. The problem is: they are all very expensive.     4. Amazon EC2/S3 ? Is it worth thinking about this</p><p>5 0.43232813 <a title="1202-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-27-Scalable_virus_scanning_for_web-applications.html">328 high scalability-2008-05-27-Scalable virus scanning for web-applications</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,     We're looking for a highly scalable way of scanning documents being uploaded and downloaded from our web application. I believe services like gmail and hotmail are using bespoke solutions from companies like Trend, but are there some quality "off the shelf" products out there that can easily be scaled out and have a "loose" API (HTTP based) for application integration?     Once again, thanks for any input.</p><p>6 0.33110446 <a title="1202-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-08-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_8%2C_2011.html">1076 high scalability-2011-07-08-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 8, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is an interview withMemSQLcofounder'sEric FrenkielandNikita Shamgunov, in
which they try to answer critics by going into more depth about their
technology.MemSQL ruffled a few feathers with their claim of being the fastest
database in the world. According to their benchmarks MemSQL can execute 200K
TPS on an EC2QuadrupleExtra Largeand on a 64 core machine they can push 1.2
million transactions a second.Benchmarks are always a dark mirror, so make of
them what you will, but the target market for MemSQL is clear: projects
looking for something both fast and familiar. Fast as in a novel design using
a combination of technologies likeMVCC, code generation,lock-free data
structures,skip lists, andin-memory execution. Familiar as in SQL and nothing
but SQL. The only interface to MemSQL is SQL.It's right to point out MemSQL
gets a boost by being a first release. Only a limited subset of SQL is
supported, neither replication or sharding are implemented yet, and writes

<p>Introduction: Awesome paper on how particular synchronization mechanisms scale on multi-core
architectures: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Synchronization but
Were Afraid to Ask.The goal is to pick a locking approach that doesn't degrade
as the number of cores increase. Like everything else in life, that doesn't
appear to be generically possible:None of the nine locking schemes we consider
consistently outperforms any other one, on all target architectures or
workloads. Strictly speaking, to seek optimality, a lock algorithm should thus
be selected based on the hardware platform and the expected workload.
Abstract:This paper presents the most exhaustive study of synchronization to
date. We span multiple layers, from hardware cache-coherence protocols up to
high-level concurrent software. We do so on different types architectures,
from single-socket - uniform and nonuniform - to multi-socket - directory and
broadcastbased - many-cores. We draw a set of observations that, roughly
speaking,</p><p>3 0.68119192 <a title="1305-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-26-Map-Reduce_for_Machine_Learning_on_Multicore.html">581 high scalability-2009-04-26-Map-Reduce for Machine Learning on Multicore</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We are at the beginning of the multicore era. Computers will have increasingly
many cores (processors), but there is still no good programming framework for
these architectures, and thus no simple and unified way for machine learning
to take advantage of the potential speed up.In this paper, we develop a
broadly applicable parallel programming method, one that is easily applied to
many different learning algorithms. Our work is in distinct contrast to the
tradition in machine learning of designing (often ingenious) ways to speed up
a single algorithm at a time.Specifically, we show that algorithms that fit
the Statistical Query model can be written in a certain “summation form,”
which allows them to be easily parallelized on multicore computers. We adapt
Google’s map-reduce paradigm to demonstrate this parallel speed up technique
on a variety of learning algorithms including locally weighted linear
regression (LWLR), k-means, logistic regression (LR), naive Bayes (NB), SVM,
ICA, PCA, g</p><p>4 0.66325998 <a title="1305-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-06-Paper%3A_High-Performance_Concurrency_Control_Mechanisms_for_Main-Memory_Databases.html">1299 high scalability-2012-08-06-Paper: High-Performance Concurrency Control Mechanisms for Main-Memory Databases</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you stayed up all night watching the life reaffirmingCuriosity landing on
Mars, then this paper,High-Performance Concurrency Control Mechanisms for
Main-Memory Databases, has nothing to do with that at all, but it is an
excellent look at how to use optimistic MVCC schemes to reduce lock overhead
on in-memory datastructures:A database system optimized for in-memory storage
can support much higher transaction rates than current systems. However,
standard concurrency control methods used today do not scale to the high
transaction rates achievable by such systems. In this paper we introduce two
efficient concurrency control methods specifically designed for main-memory
databases. Both use multiversioning to isolate read-only transactions from
updates but differ in how atomicity is ensured: one is optimistic and one is
pessimistic. To avoid expensive context switching, transactions never block
during normal processing but they may have to wait before commit to ensure
correct serializatio</p><p>5 0.63681275 <a title="1305-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-18-Paper%3A_The_Declarative_Imperative%3A_Experiences_and_Conjectures_in_Distributed_Logic.html">844 high scalability-2010-06-18-Paper: The Declarative Imperative: Experiences and Conjectures in Distributed Logic</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Declarative Imperative: Experiences and Conjectures in Distributed Logic
is written by UC Berkeley's Joseph Hellersteinfor a keynote speech he gave at
PODS. The video version of the talk is here. You may have heard about Mr.
Hellerstein through theBerkeley Orders Of Magnitude project (BOOM), whose
purpose is to help people build systems that are OOM (orders of magnitude)
bigger than are building today, with OOM less effort than traditional
programming methodologies. A noble goal which may be why BOOM was rated as a
top 10 emerging technology for 2010 byMIT Technology Review. Quite an
honor.The motivation for the talk is a familiar one: it's a dark period for
computer programming and if we don't learn how to write parallel programs the
children of Moore's law will destroy us all. We have more and more processors,
yet we are stuck on figuring out how the average programmer can exploit them.
The BOOM solution is the Bloom language which is based onDedalus: Dedalus is a

<p>Introduction: I am looking for a way to distribute files over servers in different physical
locations. My main concern is that I have bandwidth limitations on each
location, and wish to spread the bandwidth load evenly. Atm. I just have 1:1
copies of the files on all servers, and have the application pick a random
server to serve the file as a temp fix...It's a small video streaming service.
I want to spoonfeed the stream to the client with a max bandwidth output, and
support seek. At present I use php to limit the network stream, and read the
file at a given offset sendt as a get parameter from the player for seek. It's
psuedo streaming, but it works.I have been looking at MogileFS, which would
solve the storage part. With MogileFS I can make use of my current php
solution as it supports lighttpd and apache (with mod_rewrite or similar).
However I don't see how I can apply MogileFS to check for bandwidth %
usage?Any reccomendations for how I can solve this?</p><p>same-blog 3 0.95485592 <a title="1305-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-16-Paper%3A_A_Provably_Correct_Scalable_Concurrent_Skip_List.html">1305 high scalability-2012-08-16-Paper: A Provably Correct Scalable Concurrent Skip List</a></p>
<p>Introduction: InMemSQL Architecture we learned one of the core strategies MemSQL uses to
achieve their need for speed is lock-free skip lists. Skip lists are used to
efficiently handle range queries. Making the skip-lists lock-free helps
eliminate contention and make writes fast. If this all sounds a little pie-in-
the-sky then here's a very good paper on the subject that might help make it
clearer: A Provably Correct Scalable Concurrent Skip List.From the abstract:We
propose a new concurrent skip list algorithm distinguished by a combination of
simplicity and scalability. The algorithm employs optimistic synchronization,
searching without acquiring locks, followed by short lock-based validation
before adding or removing nodes. It also logically removes an item before
physically unlinking it. Unlike some other concurrent skip list algorithms,
this algorithm preserves the skiplist properties at all times, which
facilitates reasoning about its correctness. Experimental evidence shows that

<p>Introduction: Inspired by axkcd comic,Peter Norvig,Director of Research at Google and all
around interesting and nice guy, has created an above par code kata involving
a regex program that demonstrates the core inner loop of many successful
systems profiled on HighScalability.The original code is atxkcd 1313: Regex
Golf, which comes up with an algorithm to find a short regex that matches the
winners and not the losers from two arbitrary lists. The Python code is
readable, the process is TDDish, and the problem, which sounds simple, but
soon explodes into regex weirdness, as does most regex code. If you find
regular expressions confusing you'll definitely benefit from Peter's
deliberate strategy for finding a regex.The post demonstrating the iterated
improvement of the program is atxkcd 1313: Regex Golf (Part 2: Infinite
Problems). As with most first solutions it wasn't optimal. To improve the
program Peter recommends the following steps: Profiling: Figure out where the
program spends its time.

<p>Introduction: Hi,In java web servers, each http request is handled by a thread in thread
pool. So for a Servlet handling the request, a thread is assigned. It is
tempting (and very convinient) to keep context information in the threadlocal
variable. I recently had a requirement where we need to assign logged in user
id and timestamp to request sent to web services. Because we already had the
code in place, it was extremely difficult to change the method signatures to
pass user id everywhere. The solution I thought isclass ReferenceIdGenerator
{public static setReferenceId(String login) {threadLocal.set(login +
System.currentMillis());}public static String getReferenceId() {return
threadLocal.get();}private static ThreadLocal threadLocal =new
ThreadLocal();}class MySevlet {void service(.....) {HttpSession session =
request.getSession(false);String userId =
session.get("userId");ReferenceIdGenerator.setRefernceId(userId);try
{doSomething();}finally {ReferenceIdGenerator.remove();}}This method is also</p><p>6 0.93148547 <a title="1305-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-15-Sun_Customer_Ready_HPC_Cluster%3A_Reference_Configurations_with_Sun_Fire_X2200_M2_and_X2100_M2_Servers.html">418 high scalability-2008-10-15-Sun Customer Ready HPC Cluster: Reference Configurations with Sun Fire X2200 M2 and X2100 M2 Servers</a></p>

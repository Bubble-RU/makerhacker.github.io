<p>Introduction: With Amazonannouncing new High I/O 2TB SSD instancesthe age of SSD has almost
arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on
demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on
demand rate theprice per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:27 cents
($27K/100K IOPS) per vs$1.25 for disk.With the obvious benefits of giant SSD
machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it's interesting to consider: what
architecture decisions might you make differently in the future?More Headroom
for Vertical Scaling Simplifies EverythingThe beauty of higher hardware
performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows
developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This
has always been the allure ofvertical scalingand is well realized by SSDs
through a combination of high throughput, low latencies, and just as
important, high densities.We have a few early examples showing the performance

undervalued and under-discussed asset on the web.Update 7:How do you know when
you need more memcache servers?. Dathan Pattishall talks about using memcache
not to scale, but to reduce latency and reduce I/O spikes, and how to use
stats to know when more servers are needed.Update 6:Stock Traders Find Speed

<p>Introduction: HighScalability Tested, Mother Approved:12,233TPS: Twitter @ Super Bowl; 11
Million Slices: Dominos @ Super Bowl;500K requests per second: S3; The great
mobile money drain. Mobile: high resource costs, low revenue. Mobile traffic
on Plenty of Fish is growing at 3% a month, rising to 3 Billion pageviews a
month, 40% of signups are mobile, and all traffic will soon be 60-70% mobile.
The problem: how do you make money on mobile?Time to chuck microprocessors for
a networks of cells? How Networks of Biological Cells Solve Distributed
Computing Problems: Computer scientists prove that networks of cells can
compute as efficiently as networks of computers linked via the internet. We
believe that there is a need for a network model, where nodes are by design
below the computation and communication capabilities of Turing

<p>Introduction: If you've wondered why I haven't been posting lately it's because I've been on
an amazingBeach's motorcycle tourof theAlps(and,and,and,and,and,and,and,and).
My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.The trip was
more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after
mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent
Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling
local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the
winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system,
listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank
water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local
German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of
fellow riders. Magical.They say you'll ride more twists and turns on this trip

Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are
already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.We're basically using
a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and
topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on
Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store
to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget).
Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text,
author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.I'm wondering if
we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store
the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback
here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to
retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just
post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to get the r</p><p>3 0.98521405 <a title="1287-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-28-NoSQL_Took_Away_the_Relational_Model_and_Gave_Nothing_Back.html">930 high scalability-2010-10-28-NoSQL Took Away the Relational Model and Gave Nothing Back</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: Benjamin Black said he was the source of the quote and also said I was
wrong about what he meant. His real point:The meaning of the statement was
that NoSQL systems (really the various map-reduce systems) are lacking a
standard model for describing and querying and that developing one should be a
high priority task for them.At the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto, an audience
member, sorry, I couldn't tell who, said something I found really
interesting:NoSQL took away the relational model and gave nothing back.The
idea being that NoSQL has focussed on ease of use, scalability, performance,
etc, but it has lost the idea of how data relates to other data. True to its
name, the relational model is very good at capturing a managing relationships.
With NoSQL all relationships have been pushed back onto the poor programmer to
implement in code rather than the database managing it. We've sacrificed
usability. NoSQL is about concurrency, latency, and scalability, but it's not
about data.My</p><p>4 0.98224634 <a title="1287-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-10-Saying_Yes_to_NoSQL%3B_Going_Steady_with_Cassandra_at_Digg.html">793 high scalability-2010-03-10-Saying Yes to NoSQL; Going Steady with Cassandra at Digg</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The last six months have been exciting for Digg's engineering team. We're
working on a soup-to-nuts rewrite. Not only are we rewriting all our
application code, but we're also rolling out a new client and server
architecture. And if that doesn't sound like a big enough challenge, we're
replacing most of our infrastructure components and moving away from
LAMP.Perhaps our most significant infrastructure change is abandoning MySQL in
favor of a NoSQL alternative. To someone like me who's been building systems
almost exclusively on relational databases for almost 20 years, this feels
like a bold move.What's Wrong with MySQL?Our primary motivation for moving
away from MySQL is the increasing difficulty of building a high performance,
write intensive, application on a data set that is growing quickly, with no
end in sight. This growth has forced us into horizontal and vertical
partitioning strategies that have eliminated most of the value of a relational
database, while still incurring all t</p><p>5 0.98050553 <a title="1287-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine_Snippet_Search_New_Indexing_Technology.html">746 high scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine Snippet Search New Indexing Technology</a></p>

Representation technologies a new form of Web Search Engine that will unleash
a revolution of new possibilities. Introduction to Snippet SearchToday, The
Web Search Engine's is the Web getaway, especially to get specific
information. But unfortunately the search engines didn't changed mush as the
Web changed from 90's.Since the 90's the Web search engine still provide the

</p><p>8 Even with an identity transform it is more efficient to drop all of the new data into place in one transaction rather than a transaction for each item, this is the rationale for HBase bulk loading. [sent-29, score-0.546]
</p><p>9 On the other hand if the data arrives in a streaming fashion, then Coprocessors make it possible to conveniently transform it inline as it is persisted, via Observers. [sent-30, score-0.317]
</p><p>10 This is important from the perspective of the big data movement because these new or previously niche technologies are now serious contenders for big data. [sent-34, score-0.311]

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ron Pressler, the founder and CEO ofParallel Universe,
a Y Combinator company building advanced middleware for real-time
applications.A little over a month ago, we open-sourced a new in-memory data
grid calledGalaxy. An in-memory data grid, or IMDG, is a clustered data
storage and processing middleware that uses RAM as the authoritative and
primary storage, and distributes data over a cluster for purposes of data and
processing scalability and high-availability. A common feature of IMDGs is co-
location of code and data, meaning that application code runs on all cluster
nodes, each instance processing those data items residing in the local node's
RAM.While quite a few commercial and open-source IMDGs are available (like
Terracotta, Gigaspaces, Oracle Coherence, GemFire, Websphere eXtreme Scale,
Infinispan and Hazelcast), Galaxy has adopted a completely different
architecture from all other IMDGs, to service some usage scenarios ill-fitted
to the other solutions.</p><p>3 0.13208874 <a title="1292-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Are_Cloud_Based_Memory_Architectures_the_Next_Big_Thing%3F.html">538 high scalability-2009-03-16-Are Cloud Based Memory Architectures the Next Big Thing?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-
grid.It's 2003: Add a caching layer.It's 2004: Add scale-out and
partitioning.It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a
distributed file system.It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.It's 2008: Cloud

<p>Introduction: Update:Good Vibrationsby Radovan SemanÄ?ik. Lot's of interesting questions
about how Wave works, scalability, security, RESTyness, and so on.Google
Waveis a new communication and collaboration platform based on hosted XML
documents (called waves) supporting concurrent modifications and low-latency
updates. This platform enables people to communicate and work together in new,
convenient and effective ways. We will offer these benefits to users ofGoogle
Waveand we also want to share them with everyone else by making waves an open
platform that everybody can share. We welcome others to run wave servers and
become wave providers, for themselves or as services for their users, and to
"federate" waves, that is, to share waves with each other and with Google
Wave. In this way users from different wave providers can communicate and
collaborate using shared waves. We are introducing the Google Wave Federation
Protocol for federating waves between wave providers on the Internet.Hereare

across 94 locations:the Olympics Network; 2.5 quintillion:bytes of data
created each day; 80K QPS:MemSQL.In some early results Zencoder foundEC2 was
faster than GCEin their video transcoding tests, saying Google needs larger
instances with faster CPUs. Love howGoogle's jbedasaid they would take a look
at the results. +1 for competition and benchmarks. Something to keep in mind
is forGoogle a core means:  a hyperthread per virtual CPU. So that means that
a n1-standard-8 instance gets 4 physical cores and 8 hyperthreads, not 8
physical cores.Kevin Rose recommendshiring generalists rather than developers
with niche skills; don't give away your company; and thinks advisors should be
investors. Founders should also probably stick around and managers shouldn't
blame developers.IsMemSQLthe world's fastest database? BS meter on high, but

<p>Introduction: Being an authentic human being is difficult and apparently authenticating all
those S3 requests can be a bit overwhelming as well. Amazon fingered a lot of
processor heavy authentication requests as the reason for their
downtime:breakEarly this morning, at 3:30am PST, we started seeing elevated
levels of authenticated requests from multiple users in one of our locations.
While we carefully monitor our overall request volumes and these remained
within normal ranges, we had not been monitoring the proportion of
authenticated requests. Importantly, these cryptographic requests consume more
resources per call than other request types.Shortly before 4:00am PST, we
began to see several other users significantly increase their volume of
authenticated calls. The last of these pushed the authentication service over
its maximum capacity before we could complete putting new capacity in place.
In addition to processing authenticated requests, the authentication service

<p>Introduction: The Key/Value Store becames more and more popular. When we use the Key/Value
Store to store objects, we need to serialize/deserialize the objects as binary
buffer. We have many ways to serialize/deserialize objects. A possible way is
to use the Relational Database. Every value we store in the Key/Value Store is
a SQLite instance. We can use the power of the Relational Database to
manipulate the value. The SQL is very powerful for processing query

<p>Introduction: In his blog post,Scaling WSO2 Stratos, Srinath Perera explains the scaling
architecture of the WSO2 Stratos Platform as a Service (PaaS) infrastructure.
It is explained as a series of solutions where every solution adds a new
concept to solve a specific problem found in the earlier solution.Overall,
WSO2 Stratos uses a combination of intelligent Load balancing and lazy loading
to scale up the architecture. More details about Stratos can be found from the
paper WSO2 Stratos: An Industrial Stack to Support Cloud Computing.
ProblemStratos is multi-tenanted. In other words, there are many tenants. Each
tenant generally represents an organization and isolated from other tenants,
where each tenant has his own users, resources, and permissions. Stratos
supports multiple PaaS services. Each PaaS service is actually a WSO2 Products
(e.g. AS, BPS, ESB etc.) offered as a service. Using those services, tenants
may deploy their own Web Services, Mediation logic, Workflows, and Gadgets
etc. WSO2 Str</p><p>6 0.8929655 <a title="1292-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-11-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_11th%2C_2014.html">1630 high scalability-2014-04-11-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 11th, 2014</a></p>

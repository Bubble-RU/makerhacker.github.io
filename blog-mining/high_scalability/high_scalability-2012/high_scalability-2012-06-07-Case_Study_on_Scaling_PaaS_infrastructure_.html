<p>Introduction: Srinath Perera has put together astrong list of architecture patternsbased on
three meta patterns:  distribution, caching, and asynchronous processing. He
contends these three are the primal patterns and the following patterns are
but different combinations:LB (Load Balancers) + Shared nothing Units. Units
that do not share anything with each other fronted with a load balancer that
routes incoming messages to a unit based on some criteria.LB + Stateless Nodes
+ Scalable Storage. Several stateless nodes talking to a scalable storage, and
a load balancer distributes load among the nodes.Peer to Peer Architectures
(Distributed Hash Table (DHT) and Content Addressable Networks (CAN)).
Algorithm for scaling up logarithmically.Distributed Queues. Queue
implementation (FIFO delivery) implemented as a network
service.Publish/Subscribe Paradigm. Network publish subscribe brokers that
route messages to each other.Gossip and Nature-inspired Architectures. Each

<p>Introduction: Guys,At one of my jobs I have to administer a CISCO ACE (application control
engine) hardware load-balancer.I don't particularly love this beast, but it's
very very powerful.There appears to be little real-world info out there, so it
could be interesting writing an article on that.But I don't have other HW LB's
to compare it to and I don't want to rehash the product page.What would
interest you in a 'product review' of a loadbalancer?No replies means it's not
an interesting topic, so no article then ;-)</p><p>4 0.069815159 <a title="1260-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-31-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_31st%2C_2014.html">1588 high scalability-2014-01-31-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 31st, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi,we've got a web application, which runs without the common standalone
application servers like tomcat or jboss, rather it runs with an embedded
jetty server. Now we are planing to run instances of this application on
multiple machines, with a load balancer serving the requests.The big question
is: is there a common scenario on how to update these applications? Lets think
of 10 instances on 10 machines (one instance per machine), where we want to
update each of these applications version. The brute force approach would be,
to stop all instances, update and then restart it. This is a lot of manual
work ;) Another problem is down-time: so someone must only shutdown one server
after another, but then there are multiple application versions around.Can
someone please provide us with a hint for this problem? Perhaps papers, tools
or something like that?Thanks a lot :)</p><p>3 0.71134692 <a title="1260-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-22-Applying_Scalability_Patterns_to_Infrastructure_Architecture.html">906 high scalability-2010-09-22-Applying Scalability Patterns to Infrastructure Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Too often software design patterns are overlooked by network and application
delivery network architects but these patterns are often equally applicable to
addressing a broad range of architectural challenges in the application
delivery tier of the data center. By Lori Mac Vittie, F5 Networks The "High
Scalability" blog is fast becoming one of my favorite reads. Last week did not
disappoint with a posthighlighting a set of scalability design patternsthat
was, apparently, inspired by yet another High Scalability post on "6 Ways to
Kill Your Servers: Learning to Scale the Hard Way." Credit:Michael
Chow/azcentral.com  This particular post caught my attention primarily because
although I've touched on many of these patterns in the past, I've never
thought to call them what they are: scalability patterns. That's probably a
side-effect of forgetting thatbuilding an architecture of any kind is at its
core computer scienceand thus algorithms and design patterns are applicable to

<p>Introduction: If you are looking for an excellent overview of general architecture
principles then take a look at Will Larson's Introduction to Architecting
Systems for Scale. Based on his experiences at Yahoo! and Digg, Will covers
key concepts in some depth. A quick gloss on the building blocks:Load
Balancing: Scalability & Redundancy.Horizontal scalability and redundancy are
usually achieved via load balancing, the spreading of requests across multiple
resources.Smart Clients.The client has a list of hosts and load balances
across that list of hosts. Upside is simple for programmers. Downside is it's
hard to update and change.Hardware Load Balancers.Targeted at larger
companies, this is dedicated load balancing hardware. Upside is performance.
Downside is cost and complexity.Software Load Balancers.The recommended
approach, it's  software that handles load balancing, health checks,
etc.Caching.Make better use of resources you already have. Precalculate
results for later use. Application Versus Da</p><p>6 0.68716371 <a title="1260-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-30-Feedblendr_Architecture_-_Using_EC2_to_Scale.html">138 high scalability-2007-10-30-Feedblendr Architecture - Using EC2 to Scale</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:Good Vibrationsby Radovan SemanÄ?ik. Lot's of interesting questions
about how Wave works, scalability, security, RESTyness, and so on.Google
Waveis a new communication and collaboration platform based on hosted XML
documents (called waves) supporting concurrent modifications and low-latency
updates. This platform enables people to communicate and work together in new,
convenient and effective ways. We will offer these benefits to users ofGoogle
Waveand we also want to share them with everyone else by making waves an open
platform that everybody can share. We welcome others to run wave servers and
become wave providers, for themselves or as services for their users, and to
"federate" waves, that is, to share waves with each other and with Google
Wave. In this way users from different wave providers can communicate and
collaborate using shared waves. We are introducing the Google Wave Federation
Protocol for federating waves between wave providers on the Internet.Hereare

<p>Introduction: Database normalization is a technique for designing relational database
schemas that ensures that the data is optimal for ad-hoc querying and that
modifications such as deletion or insertion of data does not lead to data
inconsistency. Database denormalization is the process of optimizing your
database for reads by creating redundant data. A consequence of
denormalization is that insertions or deletions could cause data inconsistency
if not uniformly applied to all redundant copies of the data within the
database.Read more on Carnage4life blog...</p><p>same-blog 4 0.80899245 <a title="1260-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-07-Case_Study_on_Scaling_PaaS_infrastructure_.html">1260 high scalability-2012-06-07-Case Study on Scaling PaaS infrastructure </a></p>
<p>Introduction: In his blog post,Scaling WSO2 Stratos, Srinath Perera explains the scaling
architecture of the WSO2 Stratos Platform as a Service (PaaS) infrastructure.
It is explained as a series of solutions where every solution adds a new
concept to solve a specific problem found in the earlier solution.Overall,
WSO2 Stratos uses a combination of intelligent Load balancing and lazy loading
to scale up the architecture. More details about Stratos can be found from the
paper WSO2 Stratos: An Industrial Stack to Support Cloud Computing.
ProblemStratos is multi-tenanted. In other words, there are many tenants. Each
tenant generally represents an organization and isolated from other tenants,
where each tenant has his own users, resources, and permissions. Stratos
supports multiple PaaS services. Each PaaS service is actually a WSO2 Products
(e.g. AS, BPS, ESB etc.) offered as a service. Using those services, tenants
may deploy their own Web Services, Mediation logic, Workflows, and Gadgets
etc. WSO2 Str</p><p>5 0.72103918 <a title="1260-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-16-S3_Failed_Because_of_Authentication_Overload.html">249 high scalability-2008-02-16-S3 Failed Because of Authentication Overload</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Being an authentic human being is difficult and apparently authenticating all
those S3 requests can be a bit overwhelming as well. Amazon fingered a lot of
processor heavy authentication requests as the reason for their
downtime:breakEarly this morning, at 3:30am PST, we started seeing elevated
levels of authenticated requests from multiple users in one of our locations.
While we carefully monitor our overall request volumes and these remained
within normal ranges, we had not been monitoring the proportion of
authenticated requests. Importantly, these cryptographic requests consume more
resources per call than other request types.Shortly before 4:00am PST, we
began to see several other users significantly increase their volume of
authenticated calls. The last of these pushed the authentication service over
its maximum capacity before we could complete putting new capacity in place.
In addition to processing authenticated requests, the authentication service
also performs account valida</p><p>6 0.63555324 <a title="1260-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-12-SPHiveDB%3A_A_mixture_of_the_Key-Value_Store_and_the_Relational_Database..html">655 high scalability-2009-07-12-SPHiveDB: A mixture of the Key-Value Store and the Relational Database.</a></p>

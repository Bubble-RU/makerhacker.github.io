</p><p>5 This reads as ironic given Bigtable helped kickstart the NoSQL/eventual consistency/key-value revolution. [sent-12, score-0.121]
</p><p>6 We see most of the criticisms leveled against NoSQL turned out to be problems for Google too. [sent-13, score-0.198]
</p><p>7 Only Google solved the problems in a typically Googlish way, through the fruitful melding of advanced theory and technology. [sent-14, score-0.129]
</p><p>8 The result: programmers get the real transactions, schemas, and query languages many crave along with the scalability and high availability they require. [sent-15, score-0.226]
</p><p>9 The full quote:Spanner exposes the following set of data features to applications: a data model based on schematized semi-relational tables, a query language, and general purpose transactions. [sent-16, score-0.21]
</p><p>10 The need to support schematized semi-relational tables and synchronous replication is supported by the popularity of Megastore [5]. [sent-18, score-0.428]
</p><p>11 At least 300 applications within Google use Megastore (despite its relatively low performance) because its data model is simpler to manage than Bigtable's, and because of its support for synchronous replication across datacenters. [sent-19, score-0.203]
</p><p>12 The need to support a SQLlike query language in Spanner was also clear, given the popularity of Dremel [28] as an interactive data analysis tool. [sent-22, score-0.202]
</p><p>13 Finally, the lack of cross-row transactions in Bigtable led to frequent complaints; Percolator [32] was in part built to address this failing. [sent-23, score-0.218]
</p><p>14 Some authors have claimed that general two-phase commit is too expensive to support, because of the performance or availability problems that it brings [9, 10, 19]. [sent-24, score-0.241]
</p><p>15 We believe it is better to have application programmers deal with performance problems due to overuse of transactions as bottlenecks arise, rather than always coding around the lack of transactions. [sent-25, score-0.64]
</p><p>16 In any case, Google thought dealing with latency was an easier task than programmers hacking around the lack of transactions. [sent-29, score-0.227]
</p><p>17 As it is Open Source energy that drives these projects, and since few organizations need to support transactions on a global scale (yet), whereas quite a few needed to do something roughly Bigtablish, it might be awhile before we see a parallel Open Source development tract. [sent-36, score-0.166]
</p><p>18 A complicating factor for an Open Source effort is that Spanner includes the use of GPS and Atomic clock hardware. [sent-37, score-0.202]
</p><p>19 Another complicating factor is that as Masters of Disk it's not surprising Google built Spanner on top of a new Distributed File System calledColossus. [sent-42, score-0.202]

<p>Introduction: A lot of people seem to passionately dislike the termNewSQL, or pretty much
any newly coined term for that matter, but after watching Alex Lloyd, Senior
Staff Software Engineer Google, give a great talkon Building Spanner, that's
the term that fits Spanner best.Spanner wraps the SQL + transaction model of
OldSQL around the reworked bones of a globally distributed NoSQL system. That
seems NewSQL to me.As Spanner is a not so distant cousin of BigTable, the
NoSQL component should be no surprise. Spanner is charged with spanning
millions of machines inside any number of geographically distributed
datacenters. What is surprising is how OldSQL has been embraced. In anearlier
2011 talkgiven by Alex at the HotStorage conference, the reason for embracing
OldSQL was the desire to make it easier and faster for programmers to build
applications. The main ideas will seem quite familiar:There's a false
dichotomy between little complicated databases and huge, scalable, simple
ones. We can have featur</p><p>3 0.30397403 <a title="1328-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-08-F1_and_Spanner_Holistically_Compared.html">1529 high scalability-2013-10-08-F1 and Spanner Holistically Compared</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In a People of ACM interview withSanjay Ghemawat, a Google Fellow in the
Systems Infrastructure Group (MapReduce, BigTable, Spanner, GFS, etc), talks
about a few interesting aspects of Google's culture.What Made Google
GoogleProgress is a modern idea. The conviction that future can be changed for
the better through individual advancement and action has over hundreds of
years driven an exponential growth in the technome.What drives progress?
Challenges. Individuals finding and defeating a challenge. There's usually
something someone wants to do so badly that they put in the effort, the
thought, and the money into solving all the problems. The results are often
something new and amazing.And so it was for Google:The main motivation behind
the development of much of Google's infrastructure was the challenge of
keeping up with ever-growing data sets. For example, at the same time Google's
web search was gaining usage very quickly, we were also scaling up the size of
our index dramatically a</p><p>3 0.80017972 <a title="1328-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-12-Google%2B_is_Built_Using_Tools_You_Can_Use_Too%3A_Closure%2C_Java_Servlets%2C_JavaScript%2C_BigTable%2C_Colossus%2C_Quick_Turnaround.html">1078 high scalability-2011-07-12-Google+ is Built Using Tools You Can Use Too: Closure, Java Servlets, JavaScript, BigTable, Colossus, Quick Turnaround</a></p>

reveals the stack used for building Google+:Our stack is pretty standard fare
for Google apps these days: we use Java servlets for our server code and
JavaScript for the browser-side of the UI, largely built with the (open-
source) Closure framework, including Closure's JavaScript compiler and
template system. A couple nifty tricks we do: we use the HTML5 History API to
maintain pretty-looking URLs even though it's an AJAX app (falling back on
hash-fragments for older browsers); and we often render our Closure templates
server-side so the page renders before any JavaScript is loaded, then the
JavaScript finds the right DOM nodes and hooks up event handlers, etc. to make
it responsive (as a result, if you're on a slow connection and you click on
stuff really fast, you may notice a lag before it does anything, but luckily

<p>Introduction: The world has changed. And some things that should not have been forgotten,
were lost. I found these words from the Lord of the Rings echoing in my head
as I listened to a fascinating presentation by Luiz Andre Barroso,
Distinguished Engineer at Google, concerning Google's legendary past, golden
present, and apocryphal future. His talk, Warehouse-Scale Computing: Entering
the Teenage Decade, was given at theFederated Computing Research Conference.
Luiz clearly knows his stuff and was early at Google, so he has a deep and
penetrating perspective on the technology. There's much to learn from, think
about, and build.Lord of the Rings applies at two levels. At the change level,
Middle Earth went throughthree ages. While listening to Luiz talk, it seems so
has Google: Batch (indexes calculated every month), Warehouse (the datacenter
is the computer), and Instant (make it all real-time). At the "what was
forgot" level, in the Instant Age section of the talk,  a common theme was the

<p>Introduction: In Google+ Is Built Using Tools You Can Use Too: Closure, Java Servlets,
JavaScript, BigTable, Colossus, Quick Turnaround we glimpsed inside Google's
technology stack for building Google+. Mark Knichel, an engineer on the
Google+ infrastructure team, has helped us look alittle deeper on how
Javascript is handled in Google+.  Here's a quick look:They loveClosure for
its library, templates, compiler, and strict type checking. Compilation is now
required for good performance. I've wondered if GWT will be killed off as have
other Google properties, but I've been told GWT is being used heavily inside
Google, so thankfully that probably won't happen.Closure templatesare used
both Java and JavaScript to render pages server-side and in the browser. Just-
in-time JavaScript. Code is split into modules so the minimum amount of
JavaScript is loaded asynchronously in the background as necessary. Navigation
happens without loading the page.Page navigation happens without page reloads.

<p>Introduction: Google recently released apaper on Spanner, their planet enveloping tool for
organizing the world's monetizable information. Reading the Spanner paper I
felt it had that chiseled in stone feel that all of Google's best papers have.
An instant classic. Jeff Dean foreshadowed Spanner's humungousness as early
as2009.  Now Spanner seems fully online, just waiting to handle "millions of
machines across hundreds of datacenters and trillions of database rows."
Wow.The Wise have yet to weigh in on Spanner en masse. I look forward to more
insightful commentary. There's a lot to make sense of. What struck me most in
the paper was a deeply buried section essentially describing Google's
motivation for shifting away from NoSQL and toNewSQL. The money quote:We
believe it is better to have application programmers deal with performance
problems due to overuse of transactions as bottlenecks arise, rather than
always coding around the lack of transactions.This reads as ironic given

<p>Introduction: When two titans of the early computing industry, Apple co-founder Steve
Wozniakand Atari founderNolan Bushnell, had a chance to sit down for a chat at
the C2SVconference last Friday, we learned how a little foresight and luck can
decide futures.  Steve Wozniak's Success - Expandability  Steve talked about
how the Apple II was the primary source of revenue for Apple's first 10 years
of life. The reason the Apple II could last so long was that it was
expandable. It hadeight expansion slotsand the RAM was also expandable
(starting at 4K). No computer at the time had this kind of flexibility
orexpansion capabilities. Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs argued over keeping the
Apple II open. Jobs wanted closed, Wozniak wanted open and fortunately Wozniak
won.  In fact, the Apple II was completely open (those were the days). They
published the complete specs before there was anything like a developer
community. So even though the Apple III, Lisa, and the Macintosh all failed,
the Apple II kept roll</p><p>3 0.84188235 <a title="1328-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-02-Using_the_Ambient_Cloud_as_an_Application_Runtime.html">786 high scalability-2010-03-02-Using the Ambient Cloud as an Application Runtime</a></p>

Sync is used to copy large files around. Raspberry Pi is a cheap low power

of SimCity due to ineffective central infrastructure is probably the most
realistic simulation of the modern city.antirez: The point is simply to show
how SSDs can't be considered, currently, as a bit slower version of memory.
Their performance characteristics are a lot more about, simply, "faster
disks".@jessenoller: I only use JavaScript so I can gain maximum scalability
across multiple cores. Also unicorns. Paint thinner gingerbread@liammclennan:
high-scalability ruby. Why bother?@scomma: Problem with BitCoin is not
scalability, not even usability. It's whether someone will crack the algorithm
and render BTC entirely useless.@webclimber: Amazing how often I find myself
explaining that scalability is not magical@mvmsan: Flash as Primary Storage -
Highest Cost, Lack of HA, scalability and management features #flash #SSD

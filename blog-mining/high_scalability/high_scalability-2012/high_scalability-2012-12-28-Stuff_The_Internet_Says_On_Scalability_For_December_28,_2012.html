<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byNick Burling, VP of Product Management
ofBluestripe.Readers of High Scalability know are well versed in performance
optimization techniques. Reverse proxies, Varnish, Redis -- you hear about
them daily. But what you may not realize is that one of the oldest
technologies in your stack can be one of your biggest bottlenecks: DNS.People
don't spend a lot of time thinking about DNS. It's not sexy. It's an
infrastructure service, and it's just supposed to work.At BlueStripe, we work
with many teams running applications that support millions of web requests a
day. We keep seeing DNS delays and errors that the platform operations team
never knows about. It's so common we've start calling it theHidden DNS
Tax.What is the Hidden DNS Tax?The Hidden DNS Tax is a hard-to-see performance
hit your users take from DNS timeouts and errors in your back-end
architecture. We've seen it bring down the main web application for a Fortune
10 company.A DNS lookup can fail, the user gets</p><p>3 0.12960915 <a title="1378-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-07-Startups_are_Creating_a_New_System_of_the_World_for_IT.html">1240 high scalability-2012-05-07-Startups are Creating a New System of the World for IT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear? For years startups, like the frenetically inventive age of the 17th</p><p>4 0.12501128 <a title="1378-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-18-Amazon_Architecture.html">96 high scalability-2007-09-18-Amazon Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's
discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon
organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable
systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the
ACM Queue article have also been included.Amazon grew from a tiny online
bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering
new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden

<p>Introduction: The idea came up in this Hacker Newsthread, commenting on a 37signals
interview, that having three system administrators is the minimum optimal
number of admins. Everyone wants to lower their costs by having each admin
administer a lot of machines. The problem is when you have fewer than three
admins you can never get a break from the constant corrosive pressure of
always being on call. When every moment of your life you are dreading the next
emergency, it eats at you. Having three admins solves that problem. With three
admins you can:Go on a real vacation. The two remaining admins can switch off
being on call.Not be on call all the time.A larger shop will naturally have
more admins so it's not as big an issue, but at smaller shops trying to
minimize head count, carrying three admins (or people in those roles) might be
something to consider.</p><p>2 0.97441113 <a title="1378-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-15-Scaling_Ambition_at_StackOverflow.html">777 high scalability-2010-02-15-Scaling Ambition at StackOverflow</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joel Spolsky and JeffAtwood areraising VC moneyforStackOverflow.This is
interesting for three reasons: 1) Joel has always seemed like a keep it small
and grow organically type of guy, so this is a big step in a different
direction. 2) It means they think there's a very big market in the Q&A; space
and they mean to capture as much as the market as possible. 3) Most
importantly for this blog, Joel gives some good advice on when to stay fresh
and local and when it's time to jump for the brass ring, scale up your
ambition, and go for VC money. Please seeJoel's blogpost for the details, but
here's when to go VC:There's a land grab going on.There is a provable concept
that's repeatable.The business itself could benefit from the publicity.The
investor will add substantial value to the business.The business can
potentially have a big exit or become a large, publically traded company.The
founders are not in it for their own personal aggrandizement.Joel thinks

<p>Introduction: How do we scale datacenters? Should we build a few mammoth million machine
datacenters or many smaller micro datacenters? Intuitively we usually go with
a bigger is better economies of scale type argument, but it may not be so.
What works for Walmart may not work for White Box World. Mega datacenters may
actually exhibit diseconomies of scale. It may be better to run applications
over many distributed micro datacenters instead of one large one.This paper by
Ken Church, Albert Greenberg, and James Hamilton, all from Microsoft, takes a
look at the different issues and concludes:Putting it all together, the micro
model offers a design point with attractive performance, reliability, scale
and cost. Given how much the industry is currently investing in the mega
model, the industry would do well to consider the micro alternative. break

<p>Introduction: Jim Starkey, founder ofNuoDB, in thisthread on the Cloud Computing group,
delivers a masterful post on why he thinks the relational model is the best
overall compromise amongst the different options, why NewSQL can free itself
from the limitations of legacy SQL architectures, and how this creates a brave
new lock free world....I'll[Jim Starkey]go into more detail later in the post
for those who care, but the executive summary goes like this:  Network latency
is relatively high and human attention span is relatively low.  So human
facing computer systems have to perform their work in a small number of trips
between the client and the database server.  But the human condition leads
inexorably to data complexity.  There are really only two strategies to manage
this problem. One is to use coarse granularity storage, glombing together
related data into a single blob and letting intelligence on the client make
sense of it.  The other is storing fine granularity data on the server and

<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built
by a small group of people, under immense pressure, trying to get a lot of

<p>Introduction: Mobile developers have a huge scaling problem ahead: doing something useful
with massive continuous streams of telemetry data from millions and millions
of devices. This is a really good problem to have. It means smartphone sales
are finally fulfilling their destiny: slaughtering PCsin the sales arena. And
it also means mobile devices aren't just containers for simple standalone apps
anymore, they are becoming the dominant interface to giant backend
systems.While developers are now rocking mobile development on the client
side, their next challenge is how to code those tricky backend bits. A company
facing those same exact problems right now isMedialets, a mobile rich media ad
platform. What they do is help publishers create high quality interactive ads,
though for our purposes their ad stuff isn't that interesting. What I did find
really interesting about their system is how they are tackling the problem of
defeating the mobile device data deluge.Each day Medialets munches on billions</p><p>6 0.13105009 <a title="1372-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-27-42_Monster_Problems_that_Attack_as_Loads_Increase.html">1413 high scalability-2013-02-27-42 Monster Problems that Attack as Loads Increase</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Submitted for your reading pleasure on this beautiful morning:  Group Decision
Making in Honey Bee Swarms. In distributed computing systems nodes reach
aquorum when deciding what to do as a group. It turns out bees also use quorum
logic when deciding on where to nest! Bees do it a bit differently of course:
A scout bee votes for a site by spending time at it, somehow the scouts act
and interact so that their numbers rise faster at superior sites, and somehow
the bees at each site monitor their numbers there so that they know whether
they've reached the threshold number (quorum) and can proceed to initiating
the swarm's move to this site.Ants use similar mechanisms to control foraging.
Distributed systems may share common mechanisms based on their nature as being
a distributed system,  the components may not matter that much.Fire! Fire!

<p>Introduction: My name isRussell Sullivan, I am the author of AlchemyDB: a highly flexible
NoSQL/SQL/DocumentStore/GraphDB-datastore built on top of redis. I have spent
the last several years trying to find a way to sanely house multiple
datastore-genres under one roof while (almost paradoxically) pushing
performance to its limits.I recently joined the NoSQL
companyAerospike(formerly Citrusleaf) with the goal of incrementally grafting
AlchemyDB's flexible data-modeling capabilities onto Aerospike's high-velocity
horizontally-scalable key-value data-fabric. We recently completed a peak-
performanceTPS optimization project: starting at 200K TPS, pushing to the
recent community edition launch at 500K TPS, and finally arriving at our 2012
goal:1M TPS on $5K hardware.Getting to one million over-the-wire client-server
database-requests per-second on a single machine costing $5K is a balance
between trimming overhead on many axes and using a shared nothing architecture

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ron Pressler, the founder and CEO ofParallel Universe,
a Y Combinator company building advanced middleware for real-time
applications.A little over a month ago, we open-sourced a new in-memory data
grid calledGalaxy. An in-memory data grid, or IMDG, is a clustered data
storage and processing middleware that uses RAM as the authoritative and
primary storage, and distributes data over a cluster for purposes of data and
processing scalability and high-availability. A common feature of IMDGs is co-
location of code and data, meaning that application code runs on all cluster
nodes, each instance processing those data items residing in the local node's
RAM.While quite a few commercial and open-source IMDGs are available (like
Terracotta, Gigaspaces, Oracle Coherence, GemFire, Websphere eXtreme Scale,
Infinispan and Hazelcast), Galaxy has adopted a completely different
architecture from all other IMDGs, to service some usage scenarios ill-fitted
to the other solutions.</p><p>5 0.90065324 <a title="1372-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-25-Product%3A_Condor__-_Compute_Intensive_Workload_Management.html">326 high scalability-2008-05-25-Product: Condor  - Compute Intensive Workload Management</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From their website:Condoris a specialized workload management system for
compute-intensive jobs. Like other full-featured batch systems, Condor
provides a job queueing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme,
resource monitoring, and resource management. Users submit their serial or
parallel jobs to Condor, Condor places them into a queue, chooses when and
where to run the jobs based upon a policy, carefully monitors their progress,
and ultimately informs the user upon completion.While providing functionality
similar to that of a more traditional batch queueing system, Condor's novel
architecture allows it to succeed in areas where traditional scheduling
systems fail. Condor can be used to manage a cluster of dedicated compute
nodes (such as a "Beowulf" cluster). In addition, unique mechanisms enable
Condor to effectively harness wasted CPU power from otherwise idle desktop
workstations. For instance, Condor can be configured to only use desktop
machines where the keyboard and mo</p><p>6 0.87714493 <a title="1372-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-23-Hire_Facebook%2C_Ning%2C_and_Salesforce_to_Scale_for_You.html">129 high scalability-2007-10-23-Hire Facebook, Ning, and Salesforce to Scale for You</a></p>

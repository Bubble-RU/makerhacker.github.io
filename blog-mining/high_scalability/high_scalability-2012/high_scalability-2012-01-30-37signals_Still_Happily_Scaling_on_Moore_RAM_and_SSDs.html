<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.   Let's take a short trip down web architecture lane:
  It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl scripts and a SQL database   It's 1995: Scale-up the database.   It's 1998: LAMP   It's 1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SAN   It's 2001: In-memory data-grid.   It's 2003: Add a caching layer.   It's 2004: Add scale-out and partitioning.   It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a distributed file system.   It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.   It's 2008: C</p><p>3 0.16727105 <a title="1183-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-27-A_Metric_A%24%24-Ton_of_Joe_Stump%3A_The_Cloud_is_Cheaper_than_Bare_Metal.html">865 high scalability-2010-07-27-A Metric A$$-Ton of Joe Stump: The Cloud is Cheaper than Bare Metal</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Should you pay more in the cloud or pay less for bare metal in the datacenter? This is a crucial decision point facing startups today. Which way should you go? In this  Webpulp.tv interview   , Joe Stump, always a go-to guy when you need a metric ass-ton (a favorite expression of Joe’s) of good advice on cutting edge practices for the modern startup, laughs at conventional wisdom by saying  the cloud is really not more expensive than bare metal. 
 
The argument for a cheaper cloud has a three main points:
  
   Raw Hardware Costs are Close . Buying hardware is cheaper than renting hardware from Amazon, but it’s close when you consider  reserved instances . A reserved instance costs about $250 a year and a new server costs about $1500.  Let’s say Amazon is 30% slower. That means for a cluster of 20 machines you would need a another 7 servers. This takes 10 minutes and 4 button clicks to provision on the cloud (the advantage of a scale-out architecture + automation + cloud aware tools).</p><p>4 0.15050274 <a title="1183-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-28-Amazon%27s_EC2%3A_Pay_as_You_Grow_Could_Cut_Your_Costs_in_Half.html">195 high scalability-2007-12-28-Amazon's EC2: Pay as You Grow Could Cut Your Costs in Half</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2: Summize  Computes Computing Resources for a Startup . Lots of nice graphs showing Amazon is hard to beat for small machines and become less cost efficient for well used larger machines.  Long term storage costs may eat your saving away. And out of cloud bandwidth costs are high.     Update: via  ProductionScale , a nice Digital Web article on  how to setup S3 to store media files  and how Blue Origin was able to handle 3.5 million requests and 758 GBs in bandwidth in a single day for very little $$$. Also a Right Scale article on  Network performance within Amazon EC2 and to Amazon S3 . 75MB/s between EC2 instances, 10.2MB/s between EC2 and S3 for download, 6.9MB/s upload.       Now that Amazon's S3 (storage service) is   out of beta   and EC2 (elastic compute cloud) has added new   instance types   (the class of machine you can rent) with more CPU and more RAM, I thought it would be interesting to take a look out how their pricing stacks up.      The quick conclusion:  the m</p><p>5 0.14647095 <a title="1183-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles_with_Sharding_-_What_can_we_learn_from_the_Foursquare_Incident%3F.html">920 high scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles with Sharding - What can we learn from the Foursquare Incident?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great scalability solution, but caching also  comes with problems .  Sharding  is a great scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in a  post-mortem  about their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database Foursquare uses, also contributed their  post-mortem  of what went wrong too.
 
Now that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?
 
First, like for  Facebook , huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in a pretty cool industry.
 
Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built by a small group of people, under immense pressure</p><p>6 0.14325847 <a title="1183-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-06-An_Unorthodox_Approach_to_Database_Design_%3A_The_Coming_of_the_Shard.html">672 high scalability-2009-08-06-An Unorthodox Approach to Database Design : The Coming of the Shard</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Planning your next buildout and thinking SSDs are still far in the future? Still too expensive, too low density. Hard disks are cheap, familiar, and store lots of stuff. In this short and entertaining video Wikia's  Artur Bergman  wants to change your mind about SSDs. SSDs are for today, get with the math already.
 
Here's Artur's logic:
  
 Wikia is all SSD in production. The new Wikia file servers have a theoretical read rate of ~10GB/sec sequential, 6GB/sec random and 1.2 million IOPs. If you can't do math or love the past, you love spinning rust. If you are awesome you love SSDs. 
 SSDs are cheaper than drives using the most relevant metric: $/GB/IOPS. 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS and one hard drive is 180 IOPS. Need 1 SSD instead of 50 hard drives. 
 With 8 million files there's a 9 minute fsck. Full backup in 12 minutes (X-25M based). 
 4 GB/sec random read average latency 1 msec. 
 2.2 GB/sec random write average latency 1 msec.

Now. Or you're doing it wrong.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by   Brian  Bulkowski  , CTO and co-founder of   Aerospike  , a leading clustered NoSQL  database, has worked in the area of high performance commodity systems  since 1989. 
   Why flash rules for databases     The economics of flash memory are staggering.    If you’re not using SSD, you are doing it wrong.   
   Not quite true, but close. Some small applications fit entirely in memory – less than 100GB – great for in-memory solutions. There’s a place for rotational drives (HDD) in massive streaming analytics and petabytes of data. But for the vast space between, flash has become the only sensible option.  
   For example, the Samsung 840 costs $180 for 250GB. The speed rating for this drive is rated by the manufacturer at 96,000 random 4K read IOPS, and 61,000 random 4K write IOPS. The Samsung 840 is not alone at this price performance. A 300GB Intel 320 is $450. An OCZ Vertex 4 256GB is $235, with the Intel being rated as slowest, but our internal testing showing</p><p>4 0.72869903 <a title="1183-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-25-Vertical_Scaling_Ascendant_-_How_are_SSDs_Changing__Architectures%3F.html">1291 high scalability-2012-07-25-Vertical Scaling Ascendant - How are SSDs Changing  Architectures?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With Amazon     announcing new High I/O 2TB SSD instances    the age of SSD has almost arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on demand rate the   price per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:   27 cents ($27K/100K IOPS) per vs    $1.25 for disk   .     With the obvious benefits of giant SSD machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it’s interesting to consider: what architecture decisions might you make differently in the future? 
   More Headroom for Vertical Scaling Simplifies Everything   
 The beauty of higher hardware performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This has always been the allure of    vertical scaling    and is well realized by SSDs through a combination of high throughput, low latencies, and just as important, high densities.    We have a few earl</p><p>5 0.71834034 <a title="1183-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-05-Strategy%3A__In_Cloud_Computing_Systematically_Drive_Load_to_the_CPU.html">526 high scalability-2009-03-05-Strategy:  In Cloud Computing Systematically Drive Load to the CPU</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2:     Linear Bloom Filters   by Edward Kmett. A Bloom filter is a novel data structure for approximating membership in a set. A Bloom join  conserves network bandwith  by exchanging cheaper, more plentiful local CPU utilization and disk IO.    Update:     What are Amazon EC2 Compute Units?  . Cloud providers charge for CPU time in voodoo units like "compute units" and "core hours."  Geva Perry takes on the quest of figuring out what these mean in real life.       I attended Sebastian Stadil's   AWS Training Camp   Saturday and during the class Sebastian brought up a wonderfully counter-intuitive idea:   CPU (EC2) costs a lot less than storage (S3, SDB) so you should systematically move as much work as you can to the CPU  . This is said to be the   Client-Cloud Paradigm  . It leverages the well pummeled trend that CPU power follows Moore's Law while storage follows   The Great Plains' Law   (flat). And what sane computing professional would do battle with Sir Moore and his   tru</p><p>6 0.70763528 <a title="1183-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-05-Strategy%3A_Diagonal_Scaling_-_Don%27t_Forget_to_Scale_Out_AND_Up.html">142 high scalability-2007-11-05-Strategy: Diagonal Scaling - Don't Forget to Scale Out AND Up</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you are a normal human being and find the  Paxos protocol  confusing, then this paper,  Paxos Made Moderately Complex , is a great find. Robbert van Renesse from Cornell University has written a clear and well written paper with excellent explanations.
 
The Abstract:
  For anybody who has ever tried to implement it, Paxos is by no means a simple protocol, even though it is based on relatively simple invariants. This paper provides imperative pseudo-code for the full Paxos (or Multi-Paxos) protocol without shying away from discussing various implementation details. The initial description avoids optimizations that complicate comprehension. Next we discuss liveness, and list various optimizations that make the protocol practical.   Related Articles

<p>Introduction: There are so many architectural ideas swirling in the bit wind these days. Two of the biggest battles are cloud vs. bare metal and RAM vs. disk vs. SSD. 37signals has published two solid articles that are counter hype cycle in their message:
  

Technologists who grew up when RAM cost $1,000 per megabyte can have a hard time dealing with the luxury of RAM being virtually free.


The progress of technology is throwing an ever greater number of optimizations into the “premature evil” bucket never to be seen again.

  
37signals made quite a stir with their money shot of the  864GB of RAM they bought for a mere $12K  as part of their caching layer for Basecamp. That's a lot of memory for not a lot of money. There's nothing like actually seeing it in the flesh to bring the point home. Does that make  Memory Based Architectures  a little more appealing?
 
37signals then followed up with another provocative article:  Three years later, Mr. Moore is still letting us punt on database sharding</p><p>3 0.82523084 <a title="1183-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-08-Product%3A_FAI_-_Fully_Automatic_Installation.html">272 high scalability-2008-03-08-Product: FAI - Fully Automatic Installation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From their website:    FAI  is an automated installation tool to install or deploy Debian GNU/Linux and other distributions on a bunch of different hosts or a Cluster. It's more flexible than other tools like kickstart for Red Hat, autoyast and alice for SuSE or Jumpstart for SUN Solaris. FAI can also be used for configuration management of a running system.  You can take one or more virgin PCs, turn on the power and after a few minutes Linux is installed, configured and running on all your machines, without any interaction necessary. FAI it's a scalable method for installing and updating all your computers unattended with little effort involved. It's a centralized management system for your Linux deployment.  
   
  FAI's target group are system administrators who have to install Linux onto one or even hundreds of computers. It's not only a tool for doing a Cluster installation but a general purpose installation tool. It can be used for installing a Beowulf cluster, a rendering farm,</p><p>4 0.8202427 <a title="1183-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-15-Video%3A_Dryad%3A_A_general-purpose_distributed_execution_platform.html">155 high scalability-2007-11-15-Video: Dryad: A general-purpose distributed execution platform</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dryad is Microsoft's answer to Google's  map-reduce . What's the question: How do you process really large amounts of data? My initial impression of Dryad is it's like a giant Unix command line filter on steroids. There are lots of inputs, outputs, tees, queues, and merge sorts all connected together by a master exec program.  What else does Dryad have to offer the scalable infrastructure wars?
 
Dryad models programs as the execution of a directed acyclic graph. Each vertex is a program and edges are typed communication channels (files, TCP pipes, and shared memory channels within a process). Map-reduce uses a different model. It's more like a large distributed sort where the programmer defines functions for mapping, partitioning, and reducing.  Each approach seems to borrow from the spirit of its creating organization. The graph approach seems a bit too complicated and map-reduce seems a bit too simple. How ironic, in the Alanis Morissette sense.   Dryad is a middleware layer that ex</p><p>5 0.82008564 <a title="1183-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-13-un-article%3A_the_setup_behind_microsoft.com.html">186 high scalability-2007-12-13-un-article: the setup behind microsoft.com</a></p>

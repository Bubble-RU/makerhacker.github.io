<p>Introduction: Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of Technology at Facebook gave a great
presentation at UC San Diego on our favorite subject: "High Performance at
Massive Scale -  Lessons learned at Facebook". The abstract for the talk
is:Facebook has grown into one of the largest sites on the Internet today
serving over 200 billion pages per month. The nature of social data makes
engineering a site for this level of scale a particularly challenging
proposition. In this presentation, I will discuss the aspects of social data
that present challenges for scalability and will describe the the core
architectural components and design principles that Facebook has used to
address these challenges. In addition, I will discuss emerging technologies
that offer new opportunities for building cost-effective high performance web
architectures.There's a lot of interesting about this talk that we'll get into
later, but I thought you might want a head start on learning how Facebook
handles 30K+ machines, 300 million</p><p>5 0.10047895 <a title="1323-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-26-Oculus_Causes_a_Rift%2C_but_the_Facebook_Deal_Will_Avoid_a_Scaling_Crisis_for_Virtual_Reality.html">1619 high scalability-2014-03-26-Oculus Causes a Rift, but the Facebook Deal Will Avoid a Scaling Crisis for Virtual Reality</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Facebook has been teasing us. While many of their recentacquisitionshave been
surprising, shocking is the only word adequately describing Facebook's5 day
whirlwind acquisitionofOculus, immersive virtual reality visionaries, for a
now paltry sounding $2 billion.Thebacklashis a pandemic, jumping acrosssocial
networkswith the speed only a meme powered by the directly unaffected can
generate.For more than 30 years VR has been the dream burning in the heart of
every science fiction fan. Now that this future might finally be here,
Facebook's ownage makes it seem like a wonderful and hopeful timeline has been
choked off, killing the Metaverse before it even had a chance to begin.For the
many who voted for an open future with theirKickstarter dollars, there's a
deep and personal sense of betrayal, despite Facebook's promise to leave
Oculus alone. The intensity of the reaction is because Oculus matters to
people. It's new, it's different, it creates a better future. It's important

onHow to Pass a Silicon Valley Software Engineering Interview. My eyes
immediately latched on to one of his key example scenarios, which involves
scaling Facebook:breakFacebook● What was Facebook day 1?– A database with a
PHP front-end● In PHP, Java, C#, whatever– How long would it take you to
reproduce Facebook's first incarnation?● A single MySQL instance with some
simple queries probably used to happily query the whole userbase.Facebook●
What is it today?● Its not about “that stuff you learned in school”– Its about
what a company with thousands of (possibly conflicting) queries per second
operatingon a directed-graph with 50 million nodes● And of course a few
Petabytes of data● And 99.99% uptime● Design decision? A Facebook user is (or
recently was) currently limited to 5000 friends.If you've been reading all the
wisdom contributed to and referenced by this website you might just rock this

<p>Introduction: Facebook made quite a splash when they released theirnative iOS app, not
because of their app per se, but because of their conclusion that theirbiggest
mistake was betting on HTML5, so they had to go native.As you might imagine
this was a bit like telling a Great White Shark that its bark is worse than
its bite.  Acommon refrainwas Facebook simply had made a bad HTML5 site, not
that HTML5 itself is bad, as plenty of other vendors have made slick well
performing mobile sites.An interesting and relevant conversation given the
rising butt kickery of mobile. But we were lacking details. Now we aren't. If
you were wondering just why Facebook ditched HTML5, Tobie Langel inPerf
Feedback - What's slowing down Mobile Facebook, lists out the reasons:Tooling
/ Developer APIs. Most importantly, the lack of tooling to track down memory
problems. Scrolling performance.Scrolling must be fast and smooth and full
featured. It's not.GPU.A clunky API and black box approach make it an
unreliable accelerat</p><p>2 0.80462676 <a title="1323-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-20-8_Ways_Stardog_Made_its_Database_Insanely_Scalable.html">1582 high scalability-2014-01-20-8 Ways Stardog Made its Database Insanely Scalable</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stardog makes a commercial graph database that is a great example of what can
be accomplished with a scale-up strategy on BigIron. In a recent article
StarDog described how they made their new 2.1 release insanely scalable,
improving query scalability by about 3 orders of magnitude and it can now
handle 50 billion triples on a $10,000 server with 32 cores and 256 GB RAM. It
can also load 20B datasets at 300,000 triples per second. What did they do
that you can also do?Avoid locks by using non-blocking algorithms and data
structures. For example, moving from BitSet to ConcurrentLinkedQueue.Use
ThreadLocal aggressively to reduce thread contention and avoid
synchronization.Batch LRU evictions in a single thread. Triggered by several
LRU caches becoming problematic when evictions were being swamped by
additions. Downside is batching increases memory pressure and GC times.Move to
SHA1 for hashing URIs, bnodes, and literal values. Making hash collisions
nearly impossible enable significant s</p><p>3 0.8016153 <a title="1323-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-30-Dramatically_Improving_Performance_by_Debugging_Brutally_Complex_Prolems.html">1314 high scalability-2012-08-30-Dramatically Improving Performance by Debugging Brutally Complex Prolems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Debugging complex problems is 90% persistence and 50% cool tools. Brendan
Gregg in10 Performance Wins tells a fascinating story of how a team at Joyent
solved some weird and challenging performance issues deep in the OS. It took
lots of effort,DTrace, Flame Graphs,USE Method, and writing custom tools when
necessary. Here's a quick summary of the solved cases:Monitoring. 1000x
improvement. An application blocked while paging anonymous memory back in. It
was also blocked during file system fsync() calls. The application was
misconfigured and sometimes briefly exceeded available memory, getting page
out.Riak. 2x improvement. The Erlang VM used half the CPU count it was
supposed to, so CPUs remained unused.  Fix was a configuration change.MySQL.
380x improvement. Reads were slow. Cause was correlated writes. Fix was to
tune the cache flush interval on the storage controller.Various. 2800x
improvement. Large systems calls to getvmusage() could take a few seconds.
Cause was a priority invers</p><p>4 0.7988047 <a title="1323-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-11-13_Screencasts_on_How_to_Scale_Rails.html">530 high scalability-2009-03-11-13 Screencasts on How to Scale Rails</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This question comes from Ulysses on aninteresting threadfrom the Mechanical
Sympathy news group, especially given how multiple processors are now the
norm:Ulysses:On an 8xCPU Linux instance,  is it at all advantageous to use the
Linux taskset command to pin an 8xJVM process set (co-ordinated as a
www.infinispan.org distributed cache/data grid) to a specific CPU affinity set
(i.e. pin JVM0 process to CPU 0, JVM1 process to CPU1, ...., JVM7process to
CPU 7) vs. just letting the Linux OS use its default mechanism for
provisioning the 8xJVM process set to the available CPUs?In effrort to seek an
optimal point (in the full event space), what are the conceptual trade-offs in
considering "searching" each permutation of provisioning an 8xJVM process set
to an 8xCPU set via taskset?Giventaskset is they key to the question, it would
help to have a definition:Used to set or retrieve the CPU affinity of a
running process given its PID or to launch a new COMMAND with a given CPU
affinity.  CPU affi</p><p>6 0.7846278 <a title="1323-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-16-Scalable_Web_Architectures_and_Application_State.html">656 high scalability-2009-07-16-Scalable Web Architectures and Application State</a></p>

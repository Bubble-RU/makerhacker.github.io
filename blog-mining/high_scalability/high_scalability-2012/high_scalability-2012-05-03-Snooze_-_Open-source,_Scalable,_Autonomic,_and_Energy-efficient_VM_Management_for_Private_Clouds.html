<p>Introduction: In Algorithm Design for Performance Aware VM Consolidation we learn some
shocking facts (gambling in Casablanca?):Average server utilization in many
data centers is low, estimated between 5% and 15%. This is wasteful because an
idle server often consumes more than 50% of peak power.Surely that's just for
old style datacenters? Nope. In Google data centers, workloads that are
consolidated use only 50% of the processor cores. Every other processor core
is left unused simply to ensure that performance does not degrade.It's a VM
wasteland. The goal is to reduce waste by packing VMs onto machines without
hurting performance or wasting resources. The idea is to select VMs that
interfere the least with each other and places them together on the same
server.It's a NP-Complete problem, but this paper describes a practical method
that performs provably close to the optimal. Interestingly they can optimize
for performance or power efficiency, so you can use different algorithms for
different work</p><p>3 0.15842347 <a title="1238-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-21-Machine_VM_%2B_Cloud_API_-_Rewriting_the_Cloud_from_Scratch.html">923 high scalability-2010-10-21-Machine VM + Cloud API - Rewriting the Cloud from Scratch</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Write a little "Hello World" program these days and it runs inside a
bewildering Russian Doll of nested environments, each layer adding its own
special performance and complexity tax. First, a language executes in its own
environment of data structure libraries, memory management, and so on. That,
more often than not, will run inside a language VM like the JVM, CLR, or V8.
The language VM will in-turn run inside a process that runs inside an OS. An
application will run in one or more threads inside a process. And the whole
thing will run inside a machine sharing VM layer like Xen. And across all of
that are frameworks for monitoring, elasticity, storage, and so on. That's a
lot of overhead for a such a little program.What if we could remove all these
taxes and run directly on the new bare metal, which some consider to be a
combination of Machine VM + Cloud API? That's exactly what a system

<p>Introduction: In the more cool stuff I've never heard of before department is something
calledSelf Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance(SCIT).Botnetsare created when
vulnerable computers live long enough to become infected with the will to do
the evil bidding of their evil masters. Security is almost always about
removing vulnerabilities (a process which to outside observers often looks
like adog chasing its tail). SCIT takes a different approach, it works on the
availability angle. Something I never thought of before, but which makes a
great deal of sense once I thought about it.With SCIT you stop and restart VM
instances every minute (or whatever depending in your desired window
vulnerability)....breakThis short exposure window means worms and viri do not
have long enough to fully infect a machine and carry out a coordinated attack.
A machine is up for a while. Does work. And then is torn down again only to be
reborn as a clean VM with no possibility of infection (unless of course the VM
mechanisms becom</p><p>5 0.13265087 <a title="1238-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-02-C_is_for_Compute_-_Google_Compute_Engine_%28GCE%29.html">1275 high scalability-2012-07-02-C is for Compute - Google Compute Engine (GCE)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After poking around theGoogle Compute Engine(GCE) documentation I had some
trouble creating a mental model of how GCE works. Is it like AWS, GAE,
Rackspace, just what is it? After watchingGoogle I/O 2012 - Introducing Google
Compute EngineandGoogle Compute Engine -- Technical Details, it turns out my
initial impression, that GCE is disarmingly straightforward, turns out to be
the point.The focus of GCE is on the C, which stands for Compute, and that's
what GCE is all about: deploying lots of servers to solve computationally hard
problems. What you get with GCE is a Super Datacenter on Google Steroids.If
you are wondering how you will run the next Instagram on GCE then that would
be missing the point. GAE is targeted at applications. GCE is targeted
at:Delivering a proven, pure, high performance, high scale compute
infrastructure using a utility pricing model, on top of an open, secure,
extensible Infrastructure-as-a-Service.Delivering an experience that feels

<p>Introduction: Update:GIGAOM onrPath Burns EC2 Appliances in a Web Portal. rBuilder adds a
portal that lets users turn software into virtual appliances.rPathdemoed their
virtual appliance management system at Monday'sAWS Meetup. What they do is
help you build a generic virtual machine image deployable on Amazon, VMWare,
Xen and other targets. The idea is to build your software application
independent of the underlying operating system and deploy it in your own or
someone else's datacenter without worrying about all the details.To put their
service in context think of rPath as how you build, deploy, and upgrade images
and someone likeRight Scalehas how you can run and managed a cluster of
deployed images.breakTo build a Virtual Appliance you pull together all your
packages through their web interface or through a Python based "recipe"
system, select a VM target, and "cook" it all into a VM image you can
immediately deploy and run.To make this magic happen they use theConary

<p>Introduction: Mind the Gap: Reconnecting Architecture and OS Research is a paper presented
atHotOS XIII, the place where researchers talk about making potential futures
happen. For a great overview of the conference take a look at this article by
Matt Welsh: Conference report: HotOS 2011 in Napa.In the VM/cloud age I
question the need of having an OS at all, programs can compile directly
against "raw" hardware, but the paper does a good job of trying to figure out
the new roll operating systems can play in the future. We've been in a long OS
holding pattern, so long that we've seen the rise of PaaS vendors skipping the
OS level abstraction completely, but there's room for a middle ground between
legacy time sharing systems of the past and service level APIs that are but
one possible future.Introduction:For too long, operating systems researchers
and developers have pretty much taken whatever computer architects have dished
out.

<p>Introduction: One of the cool things we are seeing is more tools and tool chains for
performing very high level operations quite simply.Vagrantis such a tool
forbuilding and distributing virtualized development environments.Web
developers use virtual environments every day with their web applications.
From EC2 and Rackspace Cloud to specialized solutions such as EngineYard and
Heroku, virtualization is the tool of choice for easy deployment and
infrastructure management. Vagrant aims to take those very same principles and
put them to work in the heart of the application lifecycle. By providing easy
to configure, lightweight, reproducible, and portable virtual machines
targeted at development environments, Vagrant helps maximize your productivity
and flexibility.If you've created a build and deployment system before Vagrant

<p>Introduction: Wikipedia andWikimediahave some of the best, most complete real-world
documentation on how to build highly scalable systems. This paper by Domas
Mituzas covers a lot of details about how Wikipedia works, including: an
overview of the different packages used (Linux, PowerDNS, LVS, Squid,
lighttpd, Apache, PHP5, Lucene, Mono, Memcached), how they use their CDN, how
caching works, how they profile their code, how they store their media, how
they structure their database access, how they handle search, how they handle
load balancing and administration. All with real code examples and examples of
configuration files. This is a really useful resource.Related

<p>Introduction: Snoozeis an open-source, scalable, autonomic, and energy-efficient virtual
machine (VM) management framework for private clouds. Similarly to other VM
management frameworks such as Nimbus, OpenNebula, Eucalyptus, and OpenStack it
allows to build compute infrastructures from virtualized resources.
Particularly, once installed and configured users can submit and control the
life-cycle of a large number of VMs. However, contrary to existing frameworks
for scalability and fault tolerance, Snooze employs a self-organizing and
healing (based on Apache ZooKeeper) hierarchical architecture. Moreover, it
performs distributed VM management and is designed to be energy efficient.
Therefore, it implements features to monitor and estimate VM resource (CPU,
memory, network Rx, network Tx) demands, detect and resolve overload/underload
situations, perform dynamic VM consolidation through live migration, and
finally power management to save energy. Last but not least, it integrates a
generic scheduler</p><p>3 0.8958078 <a title="1238-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-08-Stuff_to_Watch_from_Google_IO_2011.html">1055 high scalability-2011-06-08-Stuff to Watch from Google IO 2011</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With theGoogle IO Developer Conferencecompleted there aredozens and dozensof
information packed videos now available. While you won't get any of the nifty
free swag the attendees rake in, it's great of Google to make these videos
available so quickly after the conference. Let's say you don't want to watch
all the videos on the pretense you have a life, here are just a dozen
scalability and architecture related videos you might find interesting:App
Engine Backends by Justin Haugh, Greg Darke. One of this biggest complaints
about GAE are the request deadlines. Those are now gone when you rent a new
Backend node.Scaling App Engine Applicationsby Justin Haugh, Guido van Rossum.
Two parts: how App Engine scales internally and how you as a programmer make
it scale using the tools. Good discussion of scaling and why it's hard; 10,000
queries per second is a large app that needs good architecting; a good
discussion of GAE's predictive scaling formula of how it decides when to spawn
instances;</p><p>4 0.87287843 <a title="1238-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-04-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_February_4%2C_2010.html">771 high scalability-2010-02-04-Hot Scalability Links for February 4, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lots of cool stuff happening this week...Voldemort gets rebalancing.It's one
thing to shard data to scale, it's a completely different level of
functionality to manage those shards intelligently. Voldemort has stepped up
by adding advanced rebalancing functionality: Dynamic addition of new nodes to
the cluster; Deletion of nodes from cluster; Load balancing of data inside a
cluster.Microsoft Finally Opens Azure for Business.Out of the blue Microsoft
opens up their platform as a service service. Good to have more competition

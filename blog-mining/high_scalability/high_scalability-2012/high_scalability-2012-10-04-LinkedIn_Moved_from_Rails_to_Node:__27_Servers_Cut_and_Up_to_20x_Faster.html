employees presented two sessions about their server architecture at JavaOne
2008.This postcontains a summary of these presentations.Key topics include:Up-
to-date statistics about the LinkedIn user base and activity levelThe

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Jamie Hall, Co-founder & CTO ofMocoSpace, describing
the architecture for their mobile social network. This is a timely
architecture to learn from as it combines several hot trends: it is very
large, mobile, and social. What they think is especially cool about their
system is: how it optimizes for device/browser fragmentation on the mobile
Web; their multi-tiered, read/write, local/distributed caching system;
selecting PostgreSQL over MySQL as a relational DB that can scale.MocoSpace is
a mobile social network, with 12 million members and 3 billion page views a
month, which makes it one of the most highly trafficked mobile Websites in the
US. Members access the site mainly from their mobile phone Web browser,
ranging from high end smartphones to lower end devices, as well as the Web.
Activities on the site include customizing profiles, chat, instant messaging,
music, sharing photos & videos, games, eCards and blogs. The monetization

<p>Introduction: Update:Jake inDoes Django really scale better than Rails?thinks apps like FFS
shouldn't need so much hardware to scale.In a short three months Friends for
Sale (think Hot-or-Not with a market economy) grew to become a top 10 Facebook
application handling 200 gorgeous requests per second and a stunning 300
million page views a month. They did all this using Ruby on Rails, two part
time developers, a cluster of a dozen machines, and a fairly standard
architecture. How did Friends for Sale scale to sell all those beautiful
people? And how much do you think your friends are worth on the open market?

<p>Introduction: In the articleThe Onion Uses Django, And Why It Matters To Us, a lot of
interesting points are made about their ambitious infrastructure move from
Drupal/PHP to Django/Python: the move wasn't that hard, it just took time and
work because of their previous experience moving the A.V. Club website; churn
in core framework APIs make it more attractive to move than stay; supporting
the structure of older versions of the site is an unsolved problem; the built-
in Django admin saved a lot of work; group development is easier with "fewer
specialized or hacked together pieces"; they use IRC for distributed
development; sphinx for full-text search; nginx is the media server and
reverse proxy; haproxy made the launch process a 5 second procedure;
capistrano for deployment; clean component separation makes moving easier; Git
for version control; ORM with complicated querysets is a performance problem;
memcached for caching rendered pages; the CDN checks for updates every 10
minutes; videos, articl</p><p>4 0.7112332 <a title="1333-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-04-ESPN%27s_Architecture_at_Scale_-_Operating_at_100%2C000_Duh_Nuh_Nuhs_Per_Second.html">1542 high scalability-2013-11-04-ESPN's Architecture at Scale - Operating at 100,000 Duh Nuh Nuhs Per Second</a></p>
<p>Introduction: ESPN went on airin 1978. In those 30+ years think of the wonders we've seen!
When I think of ESPN I think of a world wide brand that is the very definition
of prime time. And it shows in their stats. ESPN.com peaks at 100,000 requests
per second. Their peak event is, not surprisingly, the World Cup. But would
you be surprised to learn ESPN is powered by only a few hundred servers and a
couple of dozen engineers? I was.And would you be surprised to learn ESPN is
undergoing a fundamental transition from an Enterprise architecture to one
capable of handling web scale loads driven by increasing mobile usage,
personalization, and a service orientation? Again, thinking ESPN was just
about watching sports on TV, I was surprised. ESPN is becoming much more than
that. ESPN is becoming a sports platform. How does ESPN handle all of this
complexity, responsibility, change, and load? Unlike most every other profile
on HighScalability. The fascinating story of ESPN's architecture is told

<p>Introduction: Ilya Grigorik has written another wonderful article lavishly detailing the
extraordinary tactics Chrome employs to hide network latency from users:
Chrome Networking: DNS Prefetch & TCP Preconnect. Ilya springs some surpising
factoids on us, revealing how the web has slowed and super sized:The size of
an average page has grown to 1059kB and is now composed of over80 subresource
requests.An average DNS lookup takes between 60 and 120ms. This creates a
100-200ms of latency before a request can be sent because of th full round-
trip (RTT) to perform the TCP handshake.Slow mobile experiences are largely
due to the much higher RTT's (200-1000ms) on wireless networks. Reducing the
number of outbound connections and the total byte size of your pages is the
single best optimization you can make for mobile today. Chrome reduces
apparent latency using a host of clever anticipatory mechanisms:Learns the
network topology as you use it via a Predictor object that anticipates user
behavior and futur</p><p>6 0.70388198 <a title="1333-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-04-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_October_5%2C_2012.html">1334 high scalability-2012-10-04-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For October 5, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update: How-To Minimize Load Time for Fast User Experiences. Shows how to
analyze the bottlenecks preventing websites and blogs from loading quickly and
how to resolve them.80-90% of the end-user response time is spent on the
frontend, so it makes sense to concentrate efforts there before heroically
rewriting the backend. Take a shower before buying a Porsche, if you know what
I mean. Steve Souders, author ofHigh Performance WebsitesandYslow, hasten more
best practices to speed up your website:Split the initial payloadLoad scripts
without blockingDon't scatter scriptsSplit dominant content domainsMake static
content cookie-freeReduce cookie weightMinify CSSOptimize imagesUse iframes
sparinglyTo www or not to wwwSadly, according to String Theory, there are only
26.7 rules left, so get them while they're still in our dimension.Here

<p>Introduction: When you have a large population of servers you have both the opportunity and
the incentive to perform interesting studies. Authors from Google and the
University of California in Optimizing Google's Warehouse Scale Computers: The
NUMA Experience conducted such a study, taking a look at how jobs run on
clusters of machines using a NUMA architecture. Since NUMA is common on server
class machines it's a topic of general interest for those looking to maximize
machine utilization across clusters.Some of the results are surprising:The
methodology of how to attribute such fine performance variations to NUMA
effects within such a complex system is perhaps more interesting than the
results themselves. Well worth reading just for that story.The performance
swing due to NUMA is up to 15% on AMD Barcelona for Gmail backend and 20% on
Intel Westmere for Web-search frontend. Memory locality is not always King.
Because of the interaction between NUMA and cache sharing/contention it turns
out differe</p><p>3 0.92783582 <a title="1333-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-22-How_would_you_build_the_next_Internet%3F_Loons%2C_Drones%2C_Copters%2C_Satellites%2C_or_Something_Else%3F.html">1584 high scalability-2014-01-22-How would you build the next Internet?

<p>Introduction: If you were going to design a next generation Internet at the physical layer
that routes around the current Internet, what would it look like? What should
it do? How should it work? Who should own it? How should it be paid for? How
would you access it?It has long been said the Internet routes around
obstacles. Snowden has revealed some major obstacles. The beauty of the
current current app and web system is the physical network doesn't matter. We
can just replace it with something else. Something that doesn't flow through
choke points like backhaul networks,under sea cables, andcell towers. What
might that something else look like?Google's Loon ProjectProject Loonwas so
named because the idea was thought to be loony. Maybe not.The idea is to float
high-altitude balloons 20 miles in the air to create an aerial wireless
network with up to 3G-like speeds. Signals travel through the balloon network
from balloon to balloon, then to a ground-based station connected to an

<p>Introduction: Update: More background by Ikai Lan, who worked on the mobile server team at
LinkedIn, sayssome facts were left out: the app made "a cross data center
request, guys. Running on single-threaded Rails servers (every request blocked
the entire process), running Mongrel, leaking memory like a sieve." Which
explains why any non-blocking approach would be a win. And Ikai, I hope as you
do that nobody reads HS and just does what somebody else does without
thinking. The goal here is information that you can use to make your own
decisions. Ryan Paul has written an excellent behind-the-scenes look at
LinkedIn's mobile engineering. While the mobile part of the story--23% mobile
usage; focus on simplicity, ease of use, and reliability; using a room
metaphor; 30% native, 80% HTML; embedded lightweight HTTP server; single
client-app connection--could help guide your mobile strategy, the backend
effects of moving from Rails to Node.js may also prove interesting. After
evaluation, some of the advantag</p><p>5 0.92576724 <a title="1333-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-09-Why_My_Slime_Mold_is_Better_than_Your_Hadoop_Cluster.html">1225 high scalability-2012-04-09-Why My Slime Mold is Better than Your Hadoop Cluster</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: Organism without a brain creates external memories for navigationshows
slime mold is even cooler than originally thought, storing a record of where
it's been using slime: The authors conclude, the slime isn't just the mold's
calling card. Instead, it's a way of marking the environment so that the
organism can sense where it's been, and not expend effort on searches that
won't pay off. Although the situation isn't an exact parallel, the authors
make a comparison to the pheromone trails used by ants.  InAfter Life: The
Strange Science Of Decaythere's a truly incredible sequence of gorgeously shot
video showing howcreeping slime moldsolves mazes and performs other other
amazing feats of computation. Take a look at what simple one celled organisms
can do:The whole video is really well done and shockingly revelatory. It's the
story of decay, how atoms created during the Big Bang and through countless
supernova explosions are continually rearranged and reused by the complex

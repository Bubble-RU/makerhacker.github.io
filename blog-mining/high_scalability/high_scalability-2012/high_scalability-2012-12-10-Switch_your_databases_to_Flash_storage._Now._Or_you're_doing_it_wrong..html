This blog post will tell you exactly how to build a multi-terabyte high throughput datacenter server. A fast, reliable multi-terrabyte data tier can be used for recent behavior (messages, tweets, plays, actions), or anywhere that today you use Redis or Memcache.
 
You need to know:
  
  Which SSDs work  
  Which chassis work  
  How to configure your RAID cards  
  
Intel’s SATA solutions – combined with a high capacity storage server like the Dell R720xd and a host bus adapter based on the LSI 2208, and a Flash optimized database like  Aerospike , enables high throughput and low latency.
 
In a wide configuration, with 12 to 20 drives per 2U server, individual servers can cost-effectively serve at high throughput with 16T at $2.50 per GB with the s3700, or $1.25 with the s3500.

<p>Introduction: Likewise the current belief that, in the case of artificial machines the very large and the very small are equally feasible and lasting is a manifest error. Thus, for example, a small obelisk or column or other solid figure can certainly be laid down or set up without danger of breaking, while the large ones will go to pieces under the slightest provocation, and that purely on account of their own weight. -- Galileo  
Galileo observed how things broke if they were naively scaled up. Interestingly, Google noticed a similar pattern when building larger software systems using the same techniques used to build smaller systems. 
 
 Luiz André Barroso , Distinguished Engineer at Google, talks about this fundamental property of scaling systems in his fascinating talk,  Warehouse-Scale Computing: Entering the Teenage Decade . Google found the larger the scale the greater the impact of latency variability. When a request is implemented by work done in parallel, as is common with today's service</p><p>4 0.19987449 <a title="1369-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Are_Cloud_Based_Memory_Architectures_the_Next_Big_Thing%3F.html">538 high scalability-2009-03-16-Are Cloud Based Memory Architectures the Next Big Thing?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.   Let's take a short trip down web architecture lane:
  It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl scripts and a SQL database   It's 1995: Scale-up the database.   It's 1998: LAMP   It's 1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SAN   It's 2001: In-memory data-grid.   It's 2003: Add a caching layer.   It's 2004: Add scale-out and partitioning.   It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a distributed file system.   It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.

<p>Introduction: Hi all, a     I run a site that after a complete redesign have gotten a lot more traffic. The site provides free flash games, so the biggest traffic share goes to serving flash files (from about 100K and up to several megabytes in size each.)     I currently host the entire site on a hosting provider that have no traffic limits. But since they are very cheap (yet have served me very well all the time with at least 99,9% uptime), I don't trust them in allowing me to continue consuming more and more bandwidth. I just guess I'm going to reach some internal limit they have on day, so I'm looking into moving all the flash content over to a content delivery network of some sort.     Some recent traffic stats:   August: 12 GB   September: 22 GB   October: 55 GB   November: Currently 2,3 GB pr day on average, but it's rising..     I've been looking into Amazon S3, but have not decided on anything yet. So therefor I'm asking if there are any other provides I should consider, that operates withi</p><p>6 0.17812876 <a title="1369-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-02-The_Data-Scope_Project_-_6PB_storage%2C_500GBytes-sec_sequential_IO%2C_20M_IOPS%2C_130TFlops.html">1186 high scalability-2012-02-02-The Data-Scope Project - 6PB storage, 500GBytes-sec sequential IO, 20M IOPS, 130TFlops</a></p>

Not scalable, not maintainable. ”  –Alex Szalay    While Galileo played life and death doctrinal games over the mysteries revealed by the telescope, another revolution went unnoticed, the microscope gave up mystery after mystery and nobody yet understood how subversive would be what it revealed. For the first time these new tools of perceptual augmentation allowed humans to peek behind the veil of appearance. A new new eye driving human invention and discovery for hundreds of years.     Data is another    material    that hides, revealing itself only when we look at different scales and investigate its underlying patterns. If the universe is truly    made of information   , then we are looking into truly primal stuff. A new eye is needed for Data and an ambitious project called    Data-scope    aims to be the lens.     A detailed    paper    on the Data-Scope tells more about what it is:

<p>Introduction: Most every programmer who gets sucked into deep performance analysis for long running processes eventually realizes memory allocation is the heart of evil at the center of many of their problems. So you replace malloc with something less worse. Or you tune your garbage collector like a fineÂ ukulele. But there's a smarter approach brought to you from the folks at  RAMCloud , a Stanford University production, which is a large scale, distributed, in-memory key-value database.
 
What they've found is that typical memory management approaches don't work and using a log structured approach yields massive benefits:
  

Performance measurements of log-structured memory in RAMCloud show that it enables high client through- put at 80-90% memory utilization, even with artificially stressful workloads. In the most stressful workload, a single RAMCloud server can support 270,000-410,000 durable 100-byte writes per second at 90% memory utilization. The two-level approach to cleaning improves perform</p><p>5 0.80502975 <a title="1369-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-25-Vertical_Scaling_Ascendant_-_How_are_SSDs_Changing__Architectures%3F.html">1291 high scalability-2012-07-25-Vertical Scaling Ascendant - How are SSDs Changing  Architectures?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With Amazon     announcing new High I/O 2TB SSD instances    the age of SSD has almost arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on demand rate the   price per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:   27 cents ($27K/100K IOPS) per vs    $1.25 for disk   .     With the obvious benefits of giant SSD machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it’s interesting to consider: what architecture decisions might you make differently in the future? 
   More Headroom for Vertical Scaling Simplifies Everything   
 The beauty of higher hardware performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This has always been the allure of    vertical scaling    and is well realized by SSDs through a combination of high throughput, low latencies, and just as important, high densities.

   Why flash rules for databases     The economics of flash memory are staggering.    If you’re not using SSD, you are doing it wrong.   
   Not quite true, but close. Some small applications fit entirely in memory – less than 100GB – great for in-memory solutions. There’s a place for rotational drives (HDD) in massive streaming analytics and petabytes of data. But for the vast space between, flash has become the only sensible option.  
   For example, the Samsung 840 costs $180 for 250GB. The speed rating for this drive is rated by the manufacturer at 96,000 random 4K read IOPS, and 61,000 random 4K write IOPS. The Samsung 840 is not alone at this price performance. A 300GB Intel 320 is $450. An OCZ Vertex 4 256GB is $235, with the Intel being rated as slowest, but our internal testing showing</p><p>3 0.93660545 <a title="1369-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-24-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_24th%2C_2014.html">1585 high scalability-2014-01-24-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 24th, 2014</a></p>

They were content factories, slave to an artificial transmission schedule. Because they didn't take time to be creative, then ended up sounding like a tape machine. They were run by a computer algorithm. Not a human soul. There was never room for a creative pause. Routine was the solution. And that's creativities biggest enemy.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Shawn Hsiao ,  Luke Massa , and  Victor Luu . Shawn runs  TripAdvisor ’s Technical Operations team, Luke and Victor interned on his team this past summer. This post is introduced by  Andy Gelfond , TripAdvisor’s head of engineering.   It's been a little over a year since our last post about the  TripAdvisor architecture . It has been an exciting year. Our business and team continues to grow, we are now an independent public company, and we have continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown - we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:
  
 56M visitors per month 
 350M+ pages requests a day 
 120TB+ of warehouse data running on a large Hadoop cluster, and quickly growing 
  
We also had a very successful college intern program that brought on over 60 interns this past summer, all who were quickly on boarded and doing the same kind of work a</p><p>5 0.92937863 <a title="1369-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-01-Cost_Analysis%3A_TripAdvisor_and_Pinterest_costs_on_the_AWS_cloud.html">1353 high scalability-2012-11-01-Cost Analysis: TripAdvisor and Pinterest costs on the AWS cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Ali Khajeh-Hosseini , Technical Lead at PlanForCloud.com.   
 
 I read a recent blog post about   TripAdvisor's experiment with AWS   where they attempted to process 700K HTTP requests per minute on a replica of their live site. There was also an interesting blog post on   Pinterest's massive growth on AWS  . These blogs highlighted exactly the types of questions we're interested in, mainly: 
    
  How much would it cost to deploy System X on Cloud Y?   e.g. how much would it cost to host TripAdvisor on the AWS US-East cloud?  
  Would it be cheaper to use deployment option X or Y?   e.g. would it be cheaper to use reserved instances, different types of instances, different cloud providers...  
  What happens to costs when the system grows?   e.g. Pinterest has around 410TB of data on S3, what if that keeps growing at a rate of 25% every month, like it has been in the last 10 months?

<p>Introduction: There has been an update on Pinterest:  Pinterest growth driven by Amazon cloud scalability  since our last post:  A Short on the Pinterest Stack for Handling 3+ Million Users .
 
With Pinterest we see a story very similar to that of  Instagram . Huge growth, lots of users, lots of data, with remarkably few employees, all on the cloud.
 
While it's true that both Pinterest and Instagram are not making great advances in  science and technology , that is more indicator of the easy power of today's commodity environments rather than a sign of Silicon Valley's lack of innovation. The numbers are so huge and the valuations are so high we naturally want some sort of fundamental technological revolution to underlie their growth. The revolution is more subtle. It really is just that easy to attain such growth these days, if you can execute on the right idea. Get used to it. This is the new normal.

<p>Introduction: I love it when a somewhat older article like  Pinterest Cut Costs From $54 To $20 Per Hour By Automatically Shutting Down Systems  hits Hacker News and generates a  good conversation . One of the common sentiments about the cloud was raised: why doesn't Pinterest save a lot of money by running their own hardware instead of using the cloud?
 
 Ryan Park , Operations Engineer at Pinterest, responds in what I think is the perfect  modern response  to that ultimate existential design dilemma:
  

Our #1 requirement has been to keep up with the growth in traffic on the site. We've been growing so fast that there's literally no way we could have ordered and racked equipment fast enough. We were also a very small team -- a year ago there were only about a dozen people in the whole company. At this point we're much larger, which gives us room to consider more options like colo or multiple cloud providers.


 AWS certainly feels pretty costly when you compare colo prices to the list price for o</p><p>4 0.20488493 <a title="1371-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-09-20-How_Vimeo_Saves_50%25_on_EC2_by_Playing_a_Smarter_Game.html">1326 high scalability-2012-09-20-How Vimeo Saves 50% on EC2 by Playing a Smarter Game</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nothing shows how much software architectures have changed than the intelligent scheduling of computation over differently priced compute resources. This isn't just a false economy either. Vimeo saves up to 50% on their video transcoding bill by intelligently playing the spot, reserved, and on-demand markets. If you are ready for some advanced reindeer games then take a look at   Vimeo EC2 transcoding  where they explain their thinking. Even if you don't like their rules, it's the strategy that matters. This presentation was from 2011, so it would be interesting to see if the new reserved instance market has made a difference in their strategy. 
 
Here's Vimeo's approach for minimizing costs using spot, reserved, and on-demand instances:
  
 Never bid more than threshold. It is currently set to 80% of on-demand price. 
 Not more than 10 open spot requests at any time. 
 Bid 10% more than the average price over last hour 
 Buy reserve instance capacity to meet non-peak hour loads.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Ali Khajeh-Hosseini , Technical Lead at PlanForCloud.com.   
 
 I read a recent blog post about   TripAdvisor's experiment with AWS   where they attempted to process 700K HTTP requests per minute on a replica of their live site. There was also an interesting blog post on   Pinterest's massive growth on AWS  . These blogs highlighted exactly the types of questions we're interested in, mainly: 
    
  How much would it cost to deploy System X on Cloud Y?   e.g. how much would it cost to host TripAdvisor on the AWS US-East cloud?  
  Would it be cheaper to use deployment option X or Y?   e.g. would it be cheaper to use reserved instances, different types of instances, different cloud providers...  
  What happens to costs when the system grows?   e.g. Pinterest has around 410TB of data on S3, what if that keeps growing at a rate of 25% every month, like it has been in the last 10 months?

<p>Introduction: Vaibhav Puranik  in  Web  serving in the cloud – our experiences with nginx and instance sizes  describes their experience trying to maximum traffic and minimum their web serving costs on EC2. Initially they tested with two m1.small instance types and then they the switched to two c1.mediums instance types. The m1s are the standard instance types and the c1s are the high CPU instance types. Obviously the mediums have greater capability, but the cost difference was interesting:
  
 In the long term they will save money using the larger instances and not autoscaling. With the small instances, traffic bursts caused autoscaling to kick in. New instances were started in response to load. The instances woud be up for a short period of time and then spin down again. This constant churn costs a lot of money. Selecting the larger instance sizes, which are capable of handling the load without autoscaling, turn out to save money even though they are more expensive.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Ali Khajeh-Hosseini , Technical Lead at  PlanForCloud . The original article was published  on their site . With 29 cloud price reductions I thought it would be interesting to see how the bottom line would change compared to an article  we published last year . The result is surprisingly little for TripAdvisor because prices for On Demand instances have  not dropped as fast  as for other other instances types. 
 
Over the last year and a half,  we counted 29 price reductions  in cloud services provided by AWS, Google Compute Engine, Windows Azure, and Rackspace Cloud. Price reductions have a direct effect on cloud users, but given the usual tiny reductions, how significant is that effect on the bottom line?

<p>Introduction: We've long known one of the virtues of the cloud is, through the magic of services and automation, that systems can be shut or tuned down when not in use. What may be surprising is how much money can be saved. 
 
This aspect of cloudiness got a lot of pub at  AWS re:Invent  and is being rebranded under the term  Cost-Aware Architecture . An  interesting example  was given by Ryan Park, Pinterest’s technical operations lead:
  
 20% of their systems are shutdown after hours in response to traffic loads 
 Reserved instances are used for standard traffic  
 On-demand and spot instances are used to handle the elastic load throughout the day. When more servers are needed for an auto-scaled service,  spot requests are opened and on-demand instances are started at the same time. Most services are targeted to run at about 50% on-demand and 50% spot. 
 Watchdog processes continually check what's running. More instances are launched when needed and terminated when not needed. If spot prices spik</p><p>2 0.86886102 <a title="1371-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-24-A_Scalable%2C_Commodity_Data_Center_Network_Architecture.html">371 high scalability-2008-08-24-A Scalable, Commodity Data Center Network Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Looks interesting...  Abstract: Todayâ&euro;&trade;s data centers may contain tens of thousands of computers with significant aggregate bandwidth requirements. The network architecture typically consists of a tree of routing and switching elements with progressively more specialized and expensive equipment moving up the network hierarchy. Unfortunately, even when deploying the highest-end IP switches/routers, resulting topologies may only support 50% of the aggregate bandwidth available at the edge of the network, while still incurring tremendous cost. Nonuniform bandwidth among data center nodes complicates application design and limits overall system performance. In this paper, we show how to leverage largely commodity Ethernet switches to support the full aggregate bandwidth of clusters consisting of tens of thousands of elements. Similar to how clusters of commodity computers have largely replaced more specialized SMPs and MPPs, we argue that appropriately architected and interconnected commodi</p><p>3 0.85456294 <a title="1371-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-01-Cost_Analysis%3A_TripAdvisor_and_Pinterest_costs_on_the_AWS_cloud.html">1353 high scalability-2012-11-01-Cost Analysis: TripAdvisor and Pinterest costs on the AWS cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Ali Khajeh-Hosseini , Technical Lead at PlanForCloud.com.   
 
 I read a recent blog post about   TripAdvisor's experiment with AWS   where they attempted to process 700K HTTP requests per minute on a replica of their live site. There was also an interesting blog post on   Pinterest's massive growth on AWS  . These blogs highlighted exactly the types of questions we're interested in, mainly: 
    
  How much would it cost to deploy System X on Cloud Y?   e.g. how much would it cost to host TripAdvisor on the AWS US-East cloud?  
  Would it be cheaper to use deployment option X or Y?   e.g. would it be cheaper to use reserved instances, different types of instances, different cloud providers...  
  What happens to costs when the system grows?   e.g. Pinterest has around 410TB of data on S3, what if that keeps growing at a rate of 25% every month, like it has been in the last 10 months?

<p>Introduction: The Clustered Storage Revolution 
 
If the clustered file system, clustered storage system, storage virtualization movement is new to you then this is a good intro paper. It's a both vendor puff piece and informative, so it might be worth your time.
  A Quick Hit of What's Inside  
Clustered storage architectures have the ability to pull together two or more storage devices to behave as a single entity. Clustered storage can be broken down into three types:
  
 2-way simple failover clustering 
 Namespace aggregation

<p>Introduction: Let's play a quick game of truth or sacrilage: are SQL and NoSQL are really just two sides of the same coin? That's what  Erik Meijer  and Gavin Bierman would have us believe in their "we can all get along and make a lot of money" article in the Communications of the ACM,  A Co-Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks . You don't believe it? It's math, so it must be true :-) Some key points:
  

In this article we present a mathematical data model for the most common noSQL databases—namely, key/value relationships—and demonstrate that this data model is the mathematical dual of SQL's relational data model of foreign-/primary-key relationships


...we believe that our categorical data-model formalization and monadic query language will allow the same economic growth to occur for coSQL key-value stores.

 ...In contrast to common belief, the question of big versus small data is orthogonal to the question of SQL versus coSQL. While the coSQL model naturally supports extreme sh</p><p>6 0.84548593 <a title="1371-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-05-10_Things_You_Should_Know_About_AWS.html">1543 high scalability-2013-11-05-10 Things You Should Know About AWS</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Salvatore Sanfilippowrote a response to Michel Martens' An Open Minded Reader.
There's nothing in the post or response that's controversial. I was just
struck at what a clear explication the conversation was on all the effort that
goes into optimizing read paths. We optimize reads through denormalisation, a
crazy quilt of caching layers, key-value databases, clustering of related
tables, SSD/RAM, DHTs, moving functions to storage, secondary indexes,
separating OLAP from OLTP, etc etc. We often focus so much on specific
techniques that we can forget the bigger picture of what's going on. This
little exchange made me look again at the forest, not just the trees.Michel
Martens:What does it mean to use Redis as a traditional database? If it means
to save all your data and expect to retrieve it later in new and creative
ways, then we have to agree that better tools are available. It is one of
Redis tradeoffs: you have to think in advance how you will want to get your
data back. Another trad</p><p>4 0.18289351 <a title="1303-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-19-Product%3A_Redis_-_Not_Just_Another_Key-Value_Store.html">545 high scalability-2009-03-19-Product: Redis - Not Just Another Key-Value Store</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ben Lowry, CEO ofPlaytomic. Playtomic is a game
analytics service implemented in about 8000 mobile, web and downloadable games
played by approximately 20 million people daily.Here's a good summary quote by
Ben Lowry on Hacker News:Just over 20,000,000 people hit my API yesterday
700,749,252 times, playing the ~8,000 games my analytics platform is
integrated in for a bit under 600 years in total play time. That's just
yesterday. There are lots of different bottlenecks waiting for people
operating at scale. Heroku and NodeJS, for my use case, eventually alleviated
a whole bunch of them very cheaply.Playtomic began with an almost exclusively
Microsoft.NET and Windows architecture which held up for 3 years before being
replaced with a complete rewrite using NodeJS.  During its lifetime the entire
platform grew from shared space on a single server to a full dedicated, then
spread to second dedicated, then the API server was offloaded to a VPS
provider and 4 - 6 fairl</p><p>6 0.17711756 <a title="1303-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-06-11_Common_Web_Use_Cases_Solved_in_Redis.html">1074 high scalability-2011-07-06-11 Common Web Use Cases Solved in Redis</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In How to take advantage of Redis just adding it to your stack Salvatore
'antirez' Sanfilippo shows how to solve some common problems in Redis by
taking advantage of its unique data structure handling capabilities. Common
Redis primitives like LPUSH, and LTRIM, and LREM are used to accomplish tasks
programmers need to get done, but that can be hard or slow in more traditional
stores. A very useful and practical article. How would you accomplish these
tasks in your framework?Show latest items listings in your home page. This is
a live in-memory cache and is very fast.LPUSHis used to insert a content ID at
the head of the list stored at a key.LTRIMis used to limit the number of items
in the list to 5000. If the user needs to page beyond this cache only then are
they sent to the database.Deletion and filtering. If a cached article is

<p>Introduction: A common problem of the application designers is to predict when they need to
start worrying about the Architectural/System improvements on their
application. Do I need to add more resources? If yes, then how long before I
am compelled to do so? The question is not only when but also what. Should I
plan to implement a true caching layer on top of my application or do I need
to shard my database. Do I need to move to a distributed search infrastructure
and if yes when ! Essentially we try to find out the functionalities of the
application that will become critical over time.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.99650198 <a title="1303-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-13-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Facing_scaling_issues_with_news_feeds_on_Redis.__Any_advice%3F.html">1303 high scalability-2012-08-13-Ask HighScalability: Facing scaling issues with news feeds on Redis.  Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are
already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.We're basically using
a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and
topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on
Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store
to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget).
Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text,
author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.I'm wondering if
we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store
the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback
here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to
retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just
post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to get the r</p><p>3 0.98999768 <a title="1303-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-28-DR-BC_for_web-DB_servers.html">226 high scalability-2008-01-28-DR-BC for web-DB servers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: All,I'm looking for a faster/reliable solution for DR/BC as well as for
sclability for my web/db servers. I came across VMWare Infrastructure and
other products. The I/O performance concerns me to go with virtual servers.
I'm also looking into imaging software such as Acrnois.Could anyone share
their thoughts on how it's being done with bigger names such as google/youtube
etc..?Thank you,Regards,Janakan Rajendran.</p><p>4 0.98508275 <a title="1303-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-29-Strategy%3A_Put_Mobile_Video_Into_Cold_Storage_After_30_Days.html">1201 high scalability-2012-02-29-Strategy: Put Mobile Video Into Cold Storage After 30 Days</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Limelight says 95% of Mobile Video Views Take Place in First 90 Days and 88.8
percent of views take place in the first 30 days.Since a lot of people are
working with video, which is expensive to store and serve, the implication:
there's little need to keep your video close to the user or on a CDN after 30
days.</p><p>5 0.98435831 <a title="1303-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-19-UK_Based_CDN.html">324 high scalability-2008-05-19-UK Based CDN</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,I was wondering if I could borrow the collective minds of you all to draw
up a list to the CDN's that you'd use/do use in the UK. If they're outside the
UK but have decent support then also include. The service must be cheap and
not require a huge setup fee, it's really only for a small time business; it
shares video & high-res pics so mass cheap storage is a must and wondered
whether you guys had any ideas, also costs?Mass storage isn't cheap in the UK
compared to the states, for example, unless I go colo but as I say, it's a
small setup but happens to require a fair bit of space. Would S3 be a good
starting point? What is the service like? I hear mixed reviews about it.Many
thanks,Jim</p><p>6 0.98287988 <a title="1303-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine_Snippet_Search_New_Indexing_Technology.html">746 high scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine Snippet Search New Indexing Technology</a></p>

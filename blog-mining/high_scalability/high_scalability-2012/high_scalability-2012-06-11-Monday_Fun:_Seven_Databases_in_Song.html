<p>Introduction: Cosmin Lehene ďťżwrote two excellent articles on Adobe's experiences with
HBase:Why we're using HBase: Part 1andWhy we're using HBase: Part 2. Adobe
needed ageneric,real-time, structured data storage and processing system that
could handle any data volume, with access times under 50ms, with no downtime
andno data loss. The article goes into great detail about their experiences
with HBase and their evaluation process, providing a "well reasoned impartial
use case from a commercial user". It talks about failure handling,
availability, write performance, read performance, random reads, sequential
scans, and consistency. One of the knocks against HBase has been it's
complexity, as it has many parts that need installation and configuration. All
is not lost according to the Adobe team:HBase is more complex than other
systems (you need Hadoop, Zookeeper, cluster machines have multiple roles). We
believe that for HBase, this is not accidental complexity and that the
argument that "HBase is not a</p><p>4 0.10671939 <a title="1262-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-16-Facebook%27s_New_Real-time_Messaging_System%3A_HBase_to_Store_135%2B_Billion_Messages_a_Month.html">943 high scalability-2010-11-16-Facebook's New Real-time Messaging System: HBase to Store 135+ Billion Messages a Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You may have read somewhere that Facebook has introduced a newSocial Inbox
integrating email, IM, SMS,  text messages, on-site Facebook messages. All-in-
all they need to store over 135 billion messages a month. Where do they store
all that stuff? Facebook's Kannan Muthukkaruppan gives the surprise answer
inThe Underlying Technology of Messages:HBase. HBase beat out MySQL,
Cassandra, and a few others.Why a surprise? Facebook created Cassandra and it
was purpose built for an inbox type application, but they found Cassandra's
eventual consistency model wasn't a good match for their new real-time
Messages product. Facebook also has an extensiveMySQL infrastructure, but they
found performance suffered as data set and indexes grew larger. And they could
have built their own, but they chose HBase.HBase is ascaleout table store
supporting very high rates of row-level updates over massive amounts of data.
Exactly what is needed for a Messaging system. HBase is also a column based

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byDoug Judd, original creator of Hypertable and the CEO
of Hypertable, Inc.Hypertable delivers 2X better throughput in most tests --
HBase fails 41 and 167 billion record insert tests, overwhelmed by garbage
collection -- Both systems deliver similar results for random read uniform
testWe recently conducted a test comparing the performance of Hypertable
(@hypertable) version 0.9.5.5 to that of HBase (@HBase) version 0.90.4
(CDH3u2) running Zookeeper 3.3.4.  In this post, we summarize the results and
offer explanations for the discrepancies. For the full test report,
seeHypertable vs. HBase II.IntroductionHypertable and HBase are both open
source, scalable databases modeled after Google's proprietary Bigtable
database.  The primary difference between the two systems is that Hypertable
is written in C++, while HBase is written in Java.  We modeled this test after
the one described in section 7 of theBigtable paperand tuned both systems for
maximum performance.  The t</p><p>6 0.10027988 <a title="1262-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-09-10_NoSQL_Systems_Reviewed.html">739 high scalability-2009-11-09-10 NoSQL Systems Reviewed</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Ellis reviews in theNoSQL Ecosystem the origin of the NoSQL movement
and 10 different NoSQL products and how their 1) support for multiple
datacenters,  2) the ability to add new machines to a live cluster
transparently to the your applications, 3) Data Model, 4) Query API, 5)
Persistence Design. The 10 systems reviewed are: Cassandra, CouchDB, HBase,
MongoDB, Neo4J, Redis, Riak, Scalaris, Tokyo Cabinet, Voldemort.A very
thorough and thoughtful article on the entire NoSQL space. It's clear from the
article that NoSQL is not monolithic, there is a very wide variety of
approaches to not being a relational database.Related ArticlesNOSQL = Not Only

<p>Introduction: In the "should I or shouldn't I" debate around deploying SSD, it always helps
to have real-world data. Fiesta! with alive-blog summary of a presentation by
Kenny Gorman onShutterfly on MongoDB Performance Tuning.What if you still need
more performance after doing all of this tuning? One option is to use SSDs.
Shutterfly usesFacebook's flashcache: kernel module to cache data on SSD.
Designed for MySQL/InnoDB. SSD in front of a disk, but exposed as a single
mount point. This only makes sense when you have lots of physical I/O.
Shutterfly saw a speedup of 500% w/ flashcache. A benefit is that you can
delay sharding: less complexity.The wholeseries of posts has a lot of great
information and is worth a longer look, especially if you are considering
using MongoDB. Related ArticlesSlides forMongoSF 2011 slides: MongoDB

<p>Introduction: If you understand things best when they're formatted as a musical, this video
is for you. It teaches the essentials of PostgreSQL, Riak, HBase, MongoDB,
CouchDB, Neo4J and Redis in the style of My Fair Lady. And for a change, it's
very SFW.</p><p>2 0.6090703 <a title="1262-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-10-Let%27s_Play_a_Game_of_Take_It_or_Leave_It__-_Game_1.html">1608 high scalability-2014-03-10-Let's Play a Game of Take It or Leave It  - Game 1</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The way this game is played is you read a few statements on some hot topics
below. If you agree with a statement then you "take it"; if you disagree then
you "leave it." And if you are so moved please write a convincing comment as
to why. Got it?Snowden vs. the State.Snowden represents true the spirit of
freedom and is not a threat to all we hold dear.Walled Garden vs. Federated
Freedom.The Walled Garden has won the last decade. The cycle of life will
return the balance and federated services will once again win the day.Mobile +
messaging vs. Le Web.Mobile + messaging is eating search and the web, changing
the way things are found, discovered, and bought.Fiat vs.
Cryptocurrency.BitCoin has had its 400 million dollars of fame, it's on the
way out, a tulip gone out of bloom.True Detective vs. The Field.True Detective
is the best show on TV, ever. Wired and Breaking Bad need not apply.</p><p>3 0.60014945 <a title="1262-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-19-UK_Based_CDN.html">324 high scalability-2008-05-19-UK Based CDN</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,I was wondering if I could borrow the collective minds of you all to draw
up a list to the CDN's that you'd use/do use in the UK. If they're outside the
UK but have decent support then also include. The service must be cheap and
not require a huge setup fee, it's really only for a small time business; it
shares video & high-res pics so mass cheap storage is a must and wondered
whether you guys had any ideas, also costs?Mass storage isn't cheap in the UK
compared to the states, for example, unless I go colo but as I say, it's a
small setup but happens to require a fair bit of space. Would S3 be a good
starting point? What is the service like? I hear mixed reviews about it.Many
thanks,Jim</p><p>4 0.59278268 <a title="1262-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-06-Announce%3A_First_Meeting_of_Boston_Scalability_User_Group.html">268 high scalability-2008-03-06-Announce: First Meeting of Boston Scalability User Group</a></p>

<p>Introduction: All,I'm looking for a faster/reliable solution for DR/BC as well as for
sclability for my web/db servers. I came across VMWare Infrastructure and
other products. The I/O performance concerns me to go with virtual servers.
I'm also looking into imaging software such as Acrnois.Could anyone share
their thoughts on how it's being done with bigger names such as google/youtube
etc..?Thank you,Regards,Janakan Rajendran.</p><p>6 0.58827901 <a title="1262-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine_Snippet_Search_New_Indexing_Technology.html">746 high scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine Snippet Search New Indexing Technology</a></p>

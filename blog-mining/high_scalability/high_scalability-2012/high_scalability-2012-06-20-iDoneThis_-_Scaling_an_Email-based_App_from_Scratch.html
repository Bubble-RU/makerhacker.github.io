</p><p>7 To process incoming email, we started with a 200-line script we called “getmail” to access our Gmail inbox over IMAP. [sent-22, score-0.487]
</p><p>8 We built an incoming parser using the standard library that made our getmail process much more reliable. [sent-25, score-0.709]
</p><p>9 We moved from getmail to SendGrid's incoming parse API, which basically turns incoming email into HTTP POST requests, so that we only had to worry about writing a web app. [sent-27, score-1.035]
</p><p>10 We switched because getmail could not process the incoming email fast enough due to rate-limiting from Google. [sent-28, score-0.861]

<p>Introduction: hi,   the website i work for is looking to build a email system that can handle a fair few emails (up to a hundred thousand a day).     These comprise emails like registration emails, newsletters, lots of user triggered emails and overnight emails.     At present we queue them in SQL and feed them into an smtp server on one of our web servers when the queue drops below a certain level.     this has caused our mail system to crash as well as hammer our DB server (shared!!!).     We have got an architecture of what we want to build but thought there might be something we could buy off the shelf that allowed us to keep templated emails, lists of recipients, schedule sends etc and report on it. We can't find anything     What do big websites like amazon etc use or people a little smaller but who still send loads of mail (flickr, ebuyer, or other ecommerce sites)     Cheers     tarqs</p><p>3 0.28806248 <a title="1269-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-24-Mailinator_Architecture.html">221 high scalability-2008-01-24-Mailinator Architecture</a></p>

If you don't give web sites you real email address they can't spam you. They spam Mailinator instead :-)   I love design with a point-of-view and Mailinator has a big giant harry one: performance first, second, and last. Why? Because Mailinator is free and that allows Paul to showcase his different perspective on design.

<p>Introduction: You know your product is doing well when most of your  early blog posts  deal with the status of the waiting list of hundreds of thousands of users eagerly waiting to download your product. That's the enviable position  Mailbox , a free mobile email management app, found themselves early in their release cycle. 
 
Hasn't email been done already? Apparently not. Mailbox scaled to one million users in a paltry six weeks with a team of  about 14 people . As of April they were delivering over  100 million messages per day .
 
How did they do it? Mailbox engineering lead,  Sean Beausoleil , gave an  informative interview on readwrite.com  on how Mailbox planned to scale... 
  
  Gather signals early . A pre-release launch video helped generate interest, but it also allowed them to gauge early interest before even releasing. From the overwhelming response they knew they would need to have to scale and scale quickly.

<p>Introduction: Ladar Levison of Lavabit has written an  incredible article on how  they took a centralized off-the-shelf email server that could handle only few thousand users and built their own custom distributed infrastructure for handling hundreds of thousands of email users.  Lavabit processes 70 gigabytes of data per day, is made up of 26 servers, hosts 260,000 email addresses, and processes 600,000 emails a day. That's a lot of email.   Lavabit's mission has a little edge to it too:
   Lavabit was founded as a direct reaction to the larger free e-mail services available. We felt it was possible to create an e-mail service that was fast, reliable, feature rich and didn't achieve profitability by prostituting its user base to marketers.   
What I really like about this article is that Lavabit has some challenging elements in dealing with different email protocols while being able to scale to a lot of users. There's more going on than just trying to scale out a database.

<p>Introduction: Here's an  Update On Disqus: It's Still About Realtime, But Go Demolishes Python . 
 
How do you add realtime functionality to a web scale application? That's what  Adam Hitchcock , a Software Engineer at Disqus talks about in an excellent talk:  Making DISQUS Realtime  ( slides ).
 
Disqus had to take their commenting system and add realtime capabilities to it. Not something that's easy to do when at the time of the talk (2013) they had had just hit a billion unique visitors a month.
 
What Disqus developed is a realtime commenting system called “realertime” that was tested to handle 1.5 million concurrently connected users, 45,000 new connections per second, 165,000 messages/second, with less than .2 seconds latency end-to-end.
 
The nature of a commenting system is that it is IO bound and has a high fanout, that is a comment comes in and must be sent out to a lot of readers. It's a problem very similar to what  Twitter must solve . 
 
Disqus' solution was quite interesting as was th</p><p>5 0.79746646 <a title="1269-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-24-Mailinator_Architecture.html">221 high scalability-2008-01-24-Mailinator Architecture</a></p>

They spam Mailinator instead :-)   I love design with a point-of-view and Mailinator has a big giant harry one: performance first, second, and last. Why? Because Mailinator is free and that allows Paul to showcase his different perspective on design. While competitors buy big Iron to handle load, Paul uses a big idea instead: pick the right problem and create a</p><p>6 0.78439879 <a title="1269-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-21-This_is_why_Microsoft_won._And_why_they_lost..html">1635 high scalability-2014-04-21-This is why Microsoft won.

<p>Introduction: When two titans of the early computing industry, Apple co-founder  Steve Wozniak  and Atari founder  Nolan Bushnell , had a chance to sit down for a chat at the  C2SV  conference last Friday, we learned how a little foresight and luck can decide futures.  
  Steve Wozniak's Success - Expandability       
 
 
Steve talked about how the Apple II was the primary source of revenue for Apple's first 10 years of life. The reason the Apple II could last so long was that it was expandable. It had  eight expansion slots  and the RAM was also expandable (starting at 4K). No computer at the time had this kind of flexibility or  expansion capabilities . Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs argued over keeping the Apple II open. Jobs wanted closed, Wozniak wanted open and fortunately Wozniak won.  In fact, the Apple II was completely open (those were the days). They published the complete specs before there was anything like a developer community. 
 
So even though the Apple III, Lisa, and the Macintosh al</p><p>2 0.94559026 <a title="1269-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-13-A_Note_on_How_to_Create_Teasers_When_Posting_.html">210 high scalability-2008-01-13-A Note on How to Create Teasers When Posting </a></p>
<p>Introduction: I fully and enthusiastically encourage anyone who wants to share a relevant topic  to register and post. People have added a lot of good and useful content.  Don't be shy. It's been asked how a  teaser is created when posting so the full article doesn't display on the front page. A teaser is a paragraph interesting enough to convince readers to click on the "read more" link to get the full article.        Creating a teaser in Drupal is accomplished by inserting < ! -- break -- > on a separate line directly after the text you want to be the teaser. Only DO NOT include the spaces.  So your post looks like:   Teaser Content   < ! -- break -- > (no spaces in real life)   Rest of Content     It's a bit kludgey, but it works.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.92811537 <a title="1269-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-20-iDoneThis_-_Scaling_an_Email-based_App_from_Scratch.html">1269 high scalability-2012-06-20-iDoneThis - Scaling an Email-based App from Scratch</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Rodrigo Guzman, CTO of  iDoneThis , which makes status reporting happen at your company with the lightest possible touch. 
 
 iDoneThis  is a simple management application that emails your team at the end of every day to ask, "What'd you get done today?"  Just reply with a few lines of what you got done. The following morning everyone on your team gets a digest with what the team accomplished the previous day to keep everyone in the loop and kickstart another awesome day.
 
Before we launched, we built iDoneThis over a weekend in the most rudimentary way possible.  I kid you not, we sent the first few batches of daily emails using the BCC field of a Gmail inbox.  The upshot is that we’ve had users on the site from Day 3 of its existence on.
 
We’ve gone from launch in January 2011 when we sent hundreds of emails out per day by hand to sending out over 1 million emails and handling over 200,000 incoming emails per month.  In total, customers have recorded over 1.</p><p>4 0.92172462 <a title="1269-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-12-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_October_12%2C_2012.html">1339 high scalability-2012-10-12-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For October 12, 2012</a></p>

  @adron : #ricon2012 OH "it isn't cloud, nosql or whatever, it's distributed systems... That is the change!" Smartest thing stated at a conf in ages. 
  @justinesherry : First lesson watching @eric_brewer's keynote at #ricon2012 -- distributed systems make you go bald. (Both audience and speaker!)  
  @adron : OH "What's the hello world of distributed systems?" "Twitter." 
  Mikael Ronstrom : A long career on distributed systems has learnt me that it is extremely important to do proper partitioning of data sets to achieve scalability on network level. But it is still extremely important to make each node in the distributed system as large as possible.

<p>Introduction: Hey, it's HighScalability time: 
  
 The Herokulypse. A cautionary tale of what can happen when scalability is left for later. Rap Genius created quite a stir ( reddit ,  Hacker News )  when they documented  high costs ($20K/month for 15 million monthly uniques) and poor performance (6 second average response times) using Heroku's  random routing mesh . The cause was tracked to queuing at the dyno level when the expectation was requests are routed to free dynos. Heroku admits  this is a problem . So poor load balancing combined with RoR single threading = poor performance, one that adding more dynos and spending more money won't necessarily help. While it seems clear Heroku didn't make this aspect of their system crystal clear, the incident has generated a lot of teaching moments, if you slog through it all. This is a developing story.

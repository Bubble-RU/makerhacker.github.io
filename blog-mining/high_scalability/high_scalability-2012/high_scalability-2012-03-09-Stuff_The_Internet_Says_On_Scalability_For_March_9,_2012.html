<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear?

<p>Introduction: My impression of DynamoDB before attending a   Amazon DynamoDB for Developers    talk is that it’s the usual quality service produced by Amazon: simple, fast, scalable, geographically redundant, expensive enough to make you think twice about using it, and delightfully NoOp.     After the talk my impression has become more nuanced. The quality impression still stands. Look at the    forums    and you’ll see the typical issues every product has, but no real surprises. And as a SimpleDB++, DynamoDB seems to have avoided second system syndrome and produced a more elegant design.     What was surprising is how un-cloudy DynamoDB appears to be. The cloud pillars of pay for what you use and quick elastic response to bursty traffic have been abandoned, for some understandable reasons, but the result is you really have to consider your use cases before making DynamoDB the default choice.    Here are some of my impressions from the talk...

  Built to win : 4Gb/s, 10k requests per second, 2,000 nodes, 3 datacenters, 180TB and 8.5 billion requests. Design, deploy, dismantle in 583 days to elect the President.

  @randybias : "Software-defined" is the new "cloud." Sprinkle it on your products along with an API and you *are* the future. 
 
 
 How can you resist a story about  Lady Gaga and BigData ? BigData magic helps convert her more than 31 million Twitter followers and over 51 million Facebook followers into sales by creating more intimate communities of little monsters. While Twitter, Google, Apple, and Facebook are all concentrating on eviscerating the middleman, Lady Gaga wants to cut them all out of the action too. Reap and sow. Reap and sow.

  1 trillion bits per second : IBM’s Holey Optochip;  Scale of the Universe : 2;  Infinite wireless : Vortex radio waves;  105,000 Servers : Akamai.

  @CodingFabian : IaaS = Ops without Hardware; PaaS = Devs without Ops; SaaS = Business without Devs

  @jessiekeck : Looks like my local bar takes the same approach to scalability with their paper towels as I do w/ software. http://pic.twitter.com/DTL2W1eC 
  @neil_conway : Weird: network locality is no longer important within a DC and yet communication predicted to dominate computation cost in manycore CPUs

<p>Introduction: The main thrust of the Packet Pushers  Show 41  episode was to reveal and ruminate over the horrors of a successful  attack on RSA , which puts the whole world security complex at risk. Near the end, at about 46 minutes in, there was an excellent section on how to go about building out a low cost datacenter.
 
Who cares? Well, someone emailed me this exact same question awhile back and I had a pretty useless response. So here's making up for that by summarizing the recommendations from the elite Packet Pushers cabal:
 
 
  
 Look at Arista and Juniper.  
 Juniper           
 
 Has a range of stackable switches, which includes some 10 gig. 
 If your budget can stretch for it they might make a good deal on their new QFX proto-fabric product. You can't get a full sized fabric solution, but you can get a few switches together to make a two port fabric. Good solution if you are running 10 gig and only need 30 or 40 10 gig ports.

<p>Introduction: Teams from  Princeton  and CMU are  working together  to solve one of the most difficult problems in the repertoire: scalable geo-distributed data stores. Major companies like Google and Facebook have been working on multiple datacenter database functionality for some time, but there's still a general lack of available systems that work for complex data scenarios.
 
The ideas in this paper-- Don’t Settle for Eventual: Scalable Causal Consistency for Wide-Area Storage with COPS --are different. It's not another eventually consistent system, or a traditional transaction oriented system, or a replication based system, or a system that punts on the issue. It's something new, a causally consistent system that achieves  ALPS  system properties. Move over CAP, NoSQL, etc, we have another acronym: ALPS - Available (operations always complete successfully), Low-latency (operations complete quickly (single digit milliseconds)), Partition-tolerant (operates with a partition), and Scalable (just a</p><p>4 0.82297403 <a title="1206-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-16-How_Scalable_are_Single_Page_Ajax_Apps%3F.html">124 high scalability-2007-10-16-How Scalable are Single Page Ajax Apps?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've been using GWT for an application and I get the same feeling using it that I first got using html. I've always sucked at building UIs. Starting with programming HP terminals, moving on to the Apple Lisa, then X Windows, and Microsoft Windows, I just never had IT, whatever IT is. On the Beauty and the Geek scale my interfaces are definitely horned-rimmed and pocket protector friendly. Html helped free me from all that to just build stuff that worked, but didn't have to look all that great. Expectations were pretty low and I eagerly fulfilled them. With Ajax expectations have risen again and I find myself once more easily identifiable as a styless geek. Using GWT I have some hopes I can suck a little less.     In working with GWT I was so focussed on its tasty easily digestible Ajaxy goodness, I didn't stop to think about the topic of this site: scalability. When I finally brought my distracted mind around to consider the scalability of the single page webs site I was building, I be</p><p>5 0.81411487 <a title="1206-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-16-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_September_16%2C_2011.html">1117 high scalability-2011-09-16-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For September 16, 2011</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Between love and madness lies  HighScalability : 
  
  Google now 10x better : MapReduce sorts 1 petabyte of data using 8000 computers in 33 minutes;  1 Billion on Social Networks ;  Tumblr at 10 Billion Posts ;  Twitter at 100 Million Users ;  Testing at Google Scale : 1800 builds, 120 million test suites, 60 million tests run daily. 
 From the  Dash Memo  on Google's Plan:  Go is a very promising systems-programming language in the vein of C++. We fully hope and expect that Go becomes the standard back-end language at Google over the next few years.  On GAE  Go can load from  a cold start in 100ms and the typical instance size is 4MB. Is it any wonder Go is a go? Should we expect to see Java and Python deprecated because Go is so much cheaper to run at scale?

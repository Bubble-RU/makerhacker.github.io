warehouse at 400 terabytes. Facebookprobably generatesthat every 4 days Should
your database failover automatically or wait for the guiding hands of a
helpful human? Jeremy Zawodny in Handling Database Failover at Craigslist says
Craigslist and Yahoo! handle failovers manually. Knowing when a failure has
happened is so error prone it's better to put in a human breaker in the loop.
Others think this could be a SLA buster as write requests can't be processed
while the decision is being made. Main issue is knowing anything is true in a
distributed system is hard.Review of a paper about scalable things, MPI, and

<p>Introduction: Stanford Info Lab is taking pains to document a direction we've been moving
for a while now, using RAM not just as a cache, but as the primary storage
medium. Manyquality products have built on this model. Even if the vision
isn't radical, the paper does produce a lot of data backing up the transition,
which is in itself helpful. From the The Abstract:Disk-oriented approaches to
online storage are becoming increasingly problematic: they do not scale grace-
fully to meet the needs of large-scale Web applications, and improvements in
disk capacity have far out-stripped improvements in access latency and
bandwidth. This paper argues for a new approach to datacenter storage called
RAMCloud, where information is kept entirely in DRAM and large-scale systems
are created by aggregating the main memories of thousands of commodity
servers. We believe that RAMClouds can provide durable and available storage
with 100-1000x the throughput of disk-based systems and 100-1000x lower access
latency.

<p>Introduction: Ivan Pepelnjak, in his short and information packed REDUNDANT DATA CENTER
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY video, shows why networking as played at the highest
levels is something you want to leave to professionals, like alarge animal
country vetenariandelivering a stuck foal at 2AM on a dark and stormy night.
There are always a lot questions about the black art of building redundant
datacenter networks and there's a shortage of accessible explanations. What I
liked about Ivan's video is how effortlessly he explains the issues and
tradeoffs you can expect in designing your own solution, as well as giving
creative solutions to those problems. A lot of years of experience are boiled
down to a 17 minute video.Ivan begins by showing what a canonical fully
redundant datacenter would look like:It's like an ark where everything goes
two by two. You have two datacenters, each datacenter has redundant core
switches, redundant servers, redundant disk arrays, redundant links between
datacenters (for synchro</p><p>5 0.63759005 <a title="1338-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-25-Paper%3A_Designing_Disaster_Tolerant_High_Availability_Clusters.html">25 high scalability-2007-07-25-Paper: Designing Disaster Tolerant High Availability Clusters</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hey we're moving up in the world, jumping from 19th place to 3rd place. In
case you aren't sure what I'm talking about, Jurgen Appelo goes through this
massive effort ofranking blogsaccording to Google PageRank, Technorati
Authority, Alexa Rank, Google links, and Twitter Grader Rank.Through some
obviously mistaken calculations HighScalability comes out #3. Given all the
superb competition I'm not exactly sure how that can be. Well, thanks for all
the excellent people who contribute and all the even more excellent people
that read. Now at least I have something worthy to put on my tombstone :-)</p><p>2 0.92048001 <a title="1338-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-01-Moving_Beyond_End-to-End_Path_Information_to_Optimize_CDN_Performance.html">712 high scalability-2009-10-01-Moving Beyond End-to-End Path Information to Optimize CDN Performance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You go through the expense of installing CDNs all over the globe to make sure
users always have a node close by and you notice something curious and
furious: clients still experience poor latencies. What's up with that? What do
you do to find the problem? If you are Google you build a tool (WhyHigh) to
figure out what's up. This paper is about the tool and the unexpected problem
ofhigh latencieson CDNs. The main problems they found: inefficient routing to
nearby nodes and packet queuing. But more useful is the architecture of
WhyHigh and how it goes about identifying bottle necks. And even more useful
is the general belief in creating sophisticated tools to understand and
improve your service. That's what professionals do. From the
abstract:Replicating content across a geographically distributed set of
servers and redirecting clients to the closest server in terms of latency has
emerged as a common paradigm for improving client performance. In this paper,
we analyze latencies measured</p><p>same-blog 3 0.90713388 <a title="1338-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-11-RAMCube%3A_Exploiting_Network_Proximity_for_RAM-Based_Key-Value_Store.html">1338 high scalability-2012-10-11-RAMCube: Exploiting Network Proximity for RAM-Based Key-Value Store</a></p>
<p>Introduction: RAMCube is a datacenter oriented design for RAM-based key-value store that
supports thousands or tens of thousands of servers to offer up to hundreds of
terabytes of RAM storage. Here's thePDF Paper describing the system and here's
avideo of the presentationgiven atHotCloud.The big idea is: RAMCube exploits
the proximity of a BCube network to construct a symmetric MultiRing structure,
restricting all failure detection and recovery trafﬁc within a one-hop
neighborhood, which addresses problems including false failure detection and
recovery trafﬁc congestion. In addition, RAMCube leverages BCube's multiple
paths between any pairs of servers to handle switch failures.A few notes:75%
of Facebook data is stored in memcache.RAM is 1000 time faster than diskRAM is
used in caches, but this increases application complexity as applications are
responsible for cache consistency.Under a high work load a 1% cache miss rate
can lead to a 10x performance penalty.So store data directly in RAM instead</p><p>4 0.89243144 <a title="1338-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-12-The_Rise_of_the_Virtual_Cellular_Machines.html">826 high scalability-2010-05-12-The Rise of the Virtual Cellular Machines</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My apologies if you were looking for a post about cell phones. This post is
about high density nanodevices. It's a follow up toHow will memristors change
everything? for those wishing to pursue these revolutionary ideas in more
depth. This is one of those areas where if you are in the space then there's a
lot of available information and if you are on the outside then it doesn't
even seem to exist. Fortunately, Ben Chandler from The SyNAPSE Project, was
kind enough to point me to a great set of presentations given at the12th IEEE
CNNA - International Workshop on Cellular Nanoscale Networks and their
Applications- Towards Megaprocessor Computing. WARNING: these papers contain
extreme technical content. If you are like me and you aren't an electrical
engineer, much of it may make a sort of surface sense, but the deep and twisty
details will fly over head. For the more software minded there are a couple
more accessible presentations:Intelligent Machines built with Memristive

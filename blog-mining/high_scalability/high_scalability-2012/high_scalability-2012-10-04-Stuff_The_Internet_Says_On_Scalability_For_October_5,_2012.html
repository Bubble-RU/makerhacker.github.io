<p>Introduction: Update:Digg on their choice and use of Puppet. They chose puppet over
cfengine, and bcfg2 because they liked Puppet's resource abstraction layer
(RAL), the ability to implement configuration management incrementally,
support for bundles, and the overall design philosophy.Puppetimplements a
declarative (what not how) configuration language for automating common
administration tasks. It's the system every large site writes for themselves
and it's already made for you! Ilike was able to "easily" scale from0 to
hundreds of serversusing Puppet. I can't believe I've never seen this before.
It looks really cool. What is Puppet and how can it help you scale your
website operations?breakFrom the Puppet website:Puppet has been developed to
help the sysadmin community move to building and sharing mature tools that
avoid the duplication of everyone solving the same problem. It does so in two
ways:* It provides a powerful framework to simplify the majority of the
technical tasks that sysadmins need</p><p>5 0.14971545 <a title="1334-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-07-Scale_Indefinitely_on_S3_With_These_Secrets_of_the_S3_Masters.html">1205 high scalability-2012-03-07-Scale Indefinitely on S3 With These Secrets of the S3 Masters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a great article, Amazon S3 Performance Tips & Tricks, Doug Grismore,
Director of Storage Operations for AWS, has outed the secret arcana normally
reserved for Premium Developer Support customers on how to really use S3:Size
matters. Workloads with less than 50-100 total requests per second don't
require any special effort. Customers that routinely perform thousands of
requests per second need a plan.Automated partitioning. Automated systems
scale S3 horizontally by continuously splitting data into partitions based on
high request rates and the number of keys in a partition (which leads to slow
lookups). Lessons you've learned with sharding may also apply to S3.   Avoid
hot spots. Like most sharding schemes, you want to avoid hot spots by the
smart selection of key names. S3 objects are stored inbuckets.  Each object is
identified using a key. Keys are kept in sorted order. Keys in S3 are
partitioned by prefix. Objects that sort together are stored together, so you
want to select key</p><p>6 0.14700098 <a title="1334-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-19-Puppet_monitoring%3A_how_to_monitor_the_success_or_failure_of_Puppet_runs__.html">1408 high scalability-2013-02-19-Puppet monitoring: how to monitor the success or failure of Puppet runs  </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hey, it's HighScalability time: The Herokulypse. A cautionary tale of what can
happen when scalability is left for later. Rap Genius created quite a stir
(reddit,Hacker News) when they documentedhigh costs ($20K/month for 15 million
monthly uniques) and poor performance (6 second average response times) using
Heroku'srandom routing mesh. The cause was tracked to queuing at the dyno
level when the expectation was requests are routed to free dynos. Heroku
admitsthis is a problem. So poor load balancing combined with RoR single
threading = poor performance, one that adding more dynos and spending more
money won't necessarily help. While it seems clear Heroku didn't make this
aspect of their system crystal clear, the incident has generated a lot of
teaching moments, if you slog through it all. This is a developing story.You
need money to feed the beast. Fred Wilson has somerevenue ideas for you: Paid

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Rodrigo Guzman, CTO ofiDoneThis, which makes status
reporting happen at your company with the lightest possible touch.iDoneThisis
a simple management application that emails your team at the end of every day
to ask, "What'd you get done today?" Just reply with a few lines of what you
got done. The following morning everyone on your team gets a digest with what
the team accomplished the previous day to keep everyone in the loop and
kickstart another awesome day.Before we launched, we built iDoneThis over a
weekend in the most rudimentary way possible. I kid you not, we sent the first
few batches of daily emails using the BCC field of a Gmail inbox. The upshot
is that we've had users on the site from Day 3 of its existence on.We've gone
from launch in January 2011 when we sent hundreds of emails out per day by
hand to sending out over 1 million emails and handling over 200,000 incoming
emails per month. In total, customers have recorded over 1.7 million
dones.Stat</p><p>5 0.94431311 <a title="1334-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-30-Expandability%3A_Steve_Wozniak%27s_Biggest_Success_and_Nolan_Bushnell%27s_Biggest_Regret.html">1524 high scalability-2013-09-30-Expandability: Steve Wozniak's Biggest Success and Nolan Bushnell's Biggest Regret</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When two titans of the early computing industry, Apple co-founder Steve
Wozniakand Atari founderNolan Bushnell, had a chance to sit down for a chat at
the C2SVconference last Friday, we learned how a little foresight and luck can
decide futures.  Steve Wozniak's Success - Expandability  Steve talked about
how the Apple II was the primary source of revenue for Apple's first 10 years
of life. The reason the Apple II could last so long was that it was
expandable. It hadeight expansion slotsand the RAM was also expandable
(starting at 4K). No computer at the time had this kind of flexibility
orexpansion capabilities. Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs argued over keeping the
Apple II open. Jobs wanted closed, Wozniak wanted open and fortunately Wozniak
won.  In fact, the Apple II was completely open (those were the days). They
published the complete specs before there was anything like a developer
community. So even though the Apple III, Lisa, and the Macintosh all failed,
the Apple II kept roll</p><p>6 0.94141668 <a title="1334-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-24-The_State_of_NoSQL_in_2012.html">1180 high scalability-2012-01-24-The State of NoSQL in 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: With the introduction ofRedisyour options in the key-value space just grew and
your choice of which to pick just got a lot harder. But when you think about
it, that's not a bad position to be in at all.Redis (REmote DIctionary Server)
-a key-value database. It's similar to memcached but the dataset is not
volatile, and values can be strings, exactly like in memcached, but also lists
and sets with atomic operations to push/pop elements.The key points are: open
source; speed (benchmarked performing 110,000 SET operations, and 81,000 GETs,
per second); persistence, but in an asynchronous way taking everything in
memory; support for higher level data structures and atomic operations.The

<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are
already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.We're basically using
a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and
topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on
Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store
to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget).
Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text,
author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.I'm wondering if
we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store
the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback
here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to
retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just

Redis based and will soon be revealing more about their architecture at
theConFoo conference. Some stunning, but not surprising numbers were
revealed:100 million page views per dayA cluster of Redis slaves are handling
over 300k queries per second.Some additional nuggets:Additional Redis nodes
were added because the network cards couldn't keep up with Redis.Impressed
with Redis' performance.All reads come from Redis;  we are maintaining MySQL
just to allow us to build new sorted sets as our requirement changeMost data
is found in hashes with ordered sets used to know what data to show.   A
typical lookup would be an zInterStore on: videos:filters:released,

<p>Introduction: Michael Nygard talks aboutTwo Ways To Boost Your Flagging Web Site. The idea
behind cache farms is to move memory devoted to the various caching layers
into one large farm of caches, as with memcached. The idea behind read pools
is to allocate your database read requests to a pool of dedicated read
servers, thus offloading the write server. Using a combination of the
strategies you aren't forced to scale up the database tier to scale your

without doing some degree of Performance Testing and Capacity planning.Static
vs. Dynamic Content splitting / CDN- Reverse Proxy, Splitting Static and

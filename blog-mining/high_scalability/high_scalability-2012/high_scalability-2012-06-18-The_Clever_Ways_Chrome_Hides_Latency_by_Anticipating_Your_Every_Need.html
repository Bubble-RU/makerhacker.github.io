<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by    Nick Burling , VP of Product Management of  Bluestripe . 
   Readers of High Scalability know are well versed in performance optimization techniques. Reverse proxies, Varnish, Redis — you hear about them daily. But what you may not realize is that one of the oldest technologies in your stack can be one of your biggest bottlenecks: DNS. 
   People don't spend a lot of time thinking about DNS. It's not sexy. It's an infrastructure service, and it's just supposed to work. 
  At BlueStripe, we work with many teams running applications that support millions of web requests a day. We keep seeing DNS delays and errors that the platform operations team never knows about. It's so common we've start calling it the  Hidden DNS Tax .
   What is the Hidden DNS Tax?     The Hidden DNS Tax is a hard-to-see performance hit your users take from DNS timeouts and errors in your back-end architecture. We've seen it bring down the main web application for a Fortune 10 company.</p><p>3 0.14251351 <a title="1267-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-16-Interview_With_Google%27s_Ilya_Grigorik_On_His_New_Book%3A_High_Performance_Browser_Networking.html">1533 high scalability-2013-10-16-Interview With Google's Ilya Grigorik On His New Book: High Performance Browser Networking</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are Google you don't just complain about performance on the web, you do something about it. Doing something about web performance is the job of one  Ilya Grigorik , Developer Advocate,  Make the Web Fast  at Google, and author of a great new book:  High Performance Browser Networking: What every web developer should know about networking and web performance . 
 
That's a big topic you might be saying to yourself. And it is. The book is 400 plus information packed pages. But never fear. Ilya writes in a very straightforward style. It’s like a man page for the web. Which is a good thing.
 
In case you are not familiar with Ilya, he's the perfect choice for writing such an ambitious book. For years Ilya has been producing excellent content on  his blog  and if you  search YouTube  you'll find presentation after presentation on the topics found in the book. Authority established.

 Update 7:   How do you know when you need more memcache servers? . Dathan Pattishall talks about using memcache not to scale, but to reduce latency and reduce I/O spikes, and how to use stats to know when more servers are needed.  Update 6:   Stock Traders Find Speed Pays, in Milliseconds . Goldman Sachs is making record profits off a  500 millisecond  trading advantage. Yes, latency matters. As an interesting aside, Libet found 500 msecs is about the time it takes the brain to weave together an experience of consciousness from all our sensor inputs.

<p>Introduction: Low Cost, High Performance, Strong Security: Pick Any Three  by Chris Palmer has a funny and informative presentation where the main message is:  reduce the size and frequency of network communications, which will make your pages load faster, which will improve performance enough that you can use HTTPS all the time, which will make you safe and secure on-line, which is a good thing .
  The benefits of HTTPS for security are overwhelming, but people are afraid of the performance hit. The argument is successfully made that the overhead of HTTPS is low enough that you can afford the cost if you do some basic optimization. Reducing the number of HTTP requests is a good source of low hanging fruit.
   From the Yahoo UI Blog :
  
 Reducing the number of HTTP requests has the biggest impact on reducing response time and is often the easiest performance improvement to make.

    From the Experience of Gmail : 
  
 …we found that there were between fourteen and twenty-four HTTP requests require</p><p>6 0.6544742 <a title="1267-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-22-Paper%3A_Revisiting_Network_I-O_APIs%3A_The_netmap_Framework.html">1213 high scalability-2012-03-22-Paper: Revisiting Network I-O APIs: The netmap Framework</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ilya Grigorik has written another wonderful article lavishly detailing the extraordinary tactics Chrome employs to hide network latency from users:  Chrome Networking: DNS Prefetch & TCP Preconnect . Ilya springs some surpising factoids on us, revealing how the web has slowed and super sized:
  
 The size of an average page has grown to 1059kB and is now composed of over  80 subresource requests . 
 An average DNS lookup takes between 60 and 120ms. This creates a 100-200ms of latency before a request can be sent because of th full round-trip (RTT) to perform the TCP handshake. 
 Slow mobile experiences are largely due to the much higher RTT's (200-1000ms) on wireless networks. Reducing the number of outbound connections and the total byte size of your pages is the single best optimization you can make for mobile today.  
  
Chrome reduces apparent latency using a host of clever anticipatory mechanisms:

<p>Introduction: This is an email interview with   Viktor Klang   , Director of Engineering at    Typesafe   , on the    Scala Futures    model &    Akka,    both topics on which is he is immensely passionate and knowledgeable.  
 
How do you structure your application? That’s the question I explored in the article  Beyond Threads And Callbacks . An option I did not talk about, mostly because of my own ignorance, is a powerful stack you may not be all that familiar with: Scala and Akka.
   To remedy my oversight is our acting tour guide, Typesafe’s Viktor Klang, long time Scala hacker and Java enterprise systems architect. Viktor was very patient in answering my questions and was enthusiastic about sharing his knowledge. He’s a guy who definitely knows what he is talking about. 
   I’ve implemented several Actor systems along with the messaging infrastructure, threading, async IO, service orchestration, failover, etc, so I’m innately skeptical about frameworks that remove control from the programmer at</p><p>3 0.85236293 <a title="1267-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-28-A_Practical_Guide_to_Varnish_-_Why_Varnish_Matters.html">996 high scalability-2011-02-28-A Practical Guide to Varnish - Why Varnish Matters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Jeff Su  from Factual. 
 
 
  What is Varnish?  
 Varnish  is an open source, high performance http accelerator that sits in front of a web stack and caches pages.  This caching layer is very configurable and can be used for both static and dynamic content.
 
One great thing about Varnish is that it can improve the performance of your website without requiring any code changes.  If you haven’t heard of Varnish (or have heard of it, but haven’t used it), please read on.  Adding Varnish to your stack can be completely noninvasive, but if you tweak your stack to play along with some of varnish’s more advanced features, you’ll be able to increase performance by orders of magnitude.
 
Some of the high profile companies using Varnish include:  Twitter ,  Facebook ,  Heroku  and  LinkedIn .
  Our Use Case

 The cloud is falling. Or at least shared networked storage as Reddit has a couple of long periods of downtime.  Good write up at Why reddit was down for 6 of the last 24 hours.  Upshot: Reddit is moving off EBS to local disks.

<p>Introduction: TypePad is considered the largest paid blogging service in the world.  After experience problems because of their meteoric growth, they eventually transitioned to an architecture patterned after their sister company, LiveJournal.
 
Site: http://www.typepad.com/
  The Platform    MySQL    Memcached    Perl    MogileFS    Apache    Linux 
 The Stats 
    As of 2005 TypePad sends 250mbps of traffic using multiple network pipes for 3TB of traffic a day. They were growing by 10-20% each month. I was unable to find more recent statistics. 
 The Architecture 
    Original Architecture: - Single server running Linux, Apache, Postgres, Perl, mod_perl - Storage was NFS on a filer.    A Devastating Crash Caused a New Direction - A RAID controller failed and spewed data across all RAID disks. - The database was corrupted and the backups were corrupted. - Their redundant filers suffered from "split brain" syndrome.    They move to  LiveJournal Architecture  type architecture which isn't surprising</p><p>6 0.83559924 <a title="1267-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-01-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_1%2C_2013.html">1397 high scalability-2013-02-01-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 1, 2013</a></p>

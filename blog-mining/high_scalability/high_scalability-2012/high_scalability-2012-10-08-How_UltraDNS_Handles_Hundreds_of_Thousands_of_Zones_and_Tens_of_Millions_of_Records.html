</p><p>5 We began with the code base, stabilizing our flagship proprietary C++ DNS server, instituting common best practices and automation. [sent-7, score-0.155]
</p><p>6 These environments lacked any kind of homogeneity; dozens of flavors and versions of Linux were actively in use. [sent-11, score-0.145]
</p><p>7 TLDs typically contain millions of records and change infrequently, usually daily, but the changes can be a large percentage of the records. [sent-17, score-0.27]
</p><p>8 Whereas the SLDs are smaller zones with records in the tens to hundreds of thousands, but with a higher change rate consisting of a smaller percentage of the records. [sent-18, score-0.44]
</p><p>9 DNSSEC adds an extra wrinkle in that the signed record sets along with the keys that signed them must be available at the edge together. [sent-20, score-0.238]
</p><p>10 This led us to build a DNSSEC zone signing service to address our speed and extended feature requirements. [sent-21, score-0.145]
</p><p>11 But we still needed to ensure that the proper state of a zone was presented to our DNS servers and transported in an efficient way, so we created a specialized data feeder service in Java. [sent-22, score-0.491]
</p><p>12 This yielded significant performance improvement that resulted in a >7x QPS processing capacity on a per DNS server basis. [sent-25, score-0.148]
</p><p>13 Rather than relying on database replication, our data propagation is now more predictable and stable since we only transported the data needed to the edge. [sent-26, score-0.187]
</p><p>14 Both of these enhancements have allowed us to nearly double our number of nodes and improve our DDoS mitigation as we must constantly deal with tens of gigabits per second of attack traffic. [sent-27, score-0.394]
</p><p>15 People   Technology was only one facet that was attacked, we also moved to using scrum from a waterfall model; this change has taken significant time and is still evolving today, however it has already paid great dividends. [sent-28, score-0.29]
</p><p>16 Another important change was to tighten our hiring process ensuring that the people we brought on were inline with our process and technology goals. [sent-29, score-0.227]
</p><p>17 We've taken some lessons from other great companies and refined our hiring process to address both technical as well as non-technical aspects of a candidate. [sent-30, score-0.08]
</p><p>18 Our release schedule is now approximately every 2 weeks near the end of a sprint, however there are usually interim changes that are rolled out all the time. [sent-33, score-0.17]
</p><p>19 To track ourselves, we now aim to collect metrics on everything, including our software, hardware, network, support issues, and our deliveries so that we can constantly improve. [sent-34, score-0.15]

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by    Nick Burling , VP of Product Management of  Bluestripe . 
   Readers of High Scalability know are well versed in performance optimization techniques. Reverse proxies, Varnish, Redis — you hear about them daily. But what you may not realize is that one of the oldest technologies in your stack can be one of your biggest bottlenecks: DNS. 
   People don't spend a lot of time thinking about DNS. It's not sexy. It's an infrastructure service, and it's just supposed to work. 
  At BlueStripe, we work with many teams running applications that support millions of web requests a day. We keep seeing DNS delays and errors that the platform operations team never knows about. It's so common we've start calling it the  Hidden DNS Tax .
   What is the Hidden DNS Tax?     The Hidden DNS Tax is a hard-to-see performance hit your users take from DNS timeouts and errors in your back-end architecture. We've seen it bring down the main web application for a Fortune 10 company.</p><p>3 0.14929067 <a title="1335-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-03-The_%E2%80%9CFour_Hamiltons%E2%80%9D_Framework_for_Mitigating_Faults_in_the_Cloud%3A_Avoid_it%2C_Mask_it%2C_Bound_it%2C_Fix_it_Fast.html">1604 high scalability-2014-03-03-The “Four Hamiltons” Framework for Mitigating Faults in the Cloud: Avoid it, Mask it, Bound it, Fix it Fast</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Patrick Eaton , Software Engineer and Distributed Systems Architect at Stackdriver. 
 
Stackdriver provides intelligent monitoring-as-a-service for cloud hosted applications.  Behind this easy-to-use service is a large distributed system for collecting and storing metrics and events, monitoring and alerting on them, analyzing them, and serving up all the results in a web UI.  Because we ourselves run in the cloud (mostly on AWS), we spend a lot of time thinking about how to deal with faults in the cloud.  We have developed a framework for thinking about fault mitigation for large, cloud-hosted systems.  We endearingly call this framework the “Four Hamiltons” because it is inspired by an article from James Hamilton, the Vice President and Distinguished Engineer at Amazon Web Services.
   The article that led to this framework is called “   The Power Failure Seen Around the World   ”  .  Hamilton analyzes the causes of the power outage that affected Super Bowl XL</p><p>4 0.12214489 <a title="1335-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-17-How_the_AOL.com_Architecture_Evolved_to_99.999%25_Availability%2C_8_Million_Visitors_Per_Day%2C_and_200%2C000_Requests_Per_Second.html">1597 high scalability-2014-02-17-How the AOL.com Architecture Evolved to 99.999% Availability, 8 Million Visitors Per Day, and 200,000 Requests Per Second</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Dave Hagler  Systems Architect at AOL. 
  The AOL homepages receive more than  8 million visitors per day .  That’s more daily viewers than Good Morning America or the Today Show on television.  Over a billion page views are served each month.  AOL.com has been a major internet destination since 1996, and still has a strong following of loyal users.
   The architecture for AOL.com is in it’s 5th generation .  It has essentially been rebuilt from scratch 5 times over two decades.  The current architecture was designed 6 years ago.  Pieces have been upgraded and new components have been added along the way, but the overall design remains largely intact.  The code, tools, development and deployment processes are highly tuned over 6 years of continual improvement, making the AOL.com architecture battle tested and very stable.
  The engineering team is made up of developers, testers, and operations and  totals around 25 people .  The majority are in Dulles, Virginia</p><p>5 0.11866606 <a title="1335-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-27-TripAdvisor_Architecture_-_40M_Visitors%2C_200M_Dynamic_Page_Views%2C_30TB_Data.html">1068 high scalability-2011-06-27-TripAdvisor Architecture - 40M Visitors, 200M Dynamic Page Views, 30TB Data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Andy Gelfond , VP of Engineering for TripAdvisor. Andy has been with TripAdvisor for six and a half years, wrote a lot of code in the earlier days, and has been building and running a first class engineering and operations team that is responsible for the worlds largest travel site.

For  TripAdvisor , scalability is woven into our organization on many levels - data center, software architecture, development/deployment/operations, and, most importantly, within the culture and organization. It is not enough to have a scalable data center, or a scalable software architecture. The process of designing, coding, testing, and deploying code also needs to be scalable. All of this starts with hiring and a culture and an organization that values and supports a distributed, fast, and effective development and operation of a complex and highly scalable co</p><p>6 0.11050048 <a title="1335-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-07-Startups_are_Creating_a_New_System_of_the_World_for_IT.html">1240 high scalability-2012-05-07-Startups are Creating a New System of the World for IT</a></p>

All of this starts with hiring and a culture and an organization that values and supports a distributed, fast, and effective development and operation of a complex and highly scalable co</p><p>3 0.77860284 <a title="1335-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-17-How_the_AOL.com_Architecture_Evolved_to_99.999%25_Availability%2C_8_Million_Visitors_Per_Day%2C_and_200%2C000_Requests_Per_Second.html">1597 high scalability-2014-02-17-How the AOL.com Architecture Evolved to 99.999% Availability, 8 Million Visitors Per Day, and 200,000 Requests Per Second</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Dave Hagler  Systems Architect at AOL. 
  The AOL homepages receive more than  8 million visitors per day .  That’s more daily viewers than Good Morning America or the Today Show on television.  Over a billion page views are served each month.  AOL.com has been a major internet destination since 1996, and still has a strong following of loyal users.
   The architecture for AOL.com is in it’s 5th generation .  It has essentially been rebuilt from scratch 5 times over two decades.  The current architecture was designed 6 years ago.  Pieces have been upgraded and new components have been added along the way, but the overall design remains largely intact.  The code, tools, development and deployment processes are highly tuned over 6 years of continual improvement, making the AOL.com architecture battle tested and very stable.
  The engineering team is made up of developers, testers, and operations and  totals around 25 people .  The majority are in Dulles, Virginia</p><p>4 0.7661072 <a title="1335-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-11-ATMCash_Exploits_Virtualization_for_Security_-_Immutability_and_Reversion.html">1077 high scalability-2011-07-11-ATMCash Exploits Virtualization for Security - Immutability and Reversion</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Ran Grushkowsky , Head of Technology at ATMCash. 
 
Virtualization and cloud-based systems are very hype in the industry; however, most financial companies stray from those solutions. At ATMCash, we’ve approached virtualization not for the usual reason of scalability, but for the usually missed value of security.
 
In this article, I will introduce the concept of security added value in the utilization of virtualization and why people should consider deploying mini-clouds for those use-cases. 
  How do virtual machines help mitigate risk?  
I am sure most of you have heard of the recent  hacking in the financial sector . Financial companies are under constant hacking attempts and security is of the utmost importance. One of the bigger risks in system deployment is a breach in one of the stack components. Regular system patches and maintenance fix known exploits and issues, however, sometimes it may be too late and the component has already been breached.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by    Nick Burling , VP of Product Management of  Bluestripe . 
   Readers of High Scalability know are well versed in performance optimization techniques. Reverse proxies, Varnish, Redis — you hear about them daily. But what you may not realize is that one of the oldest technologies in your stack can be one of your biggest bottlenecks: DNS. 
   People don't spend a lot of time thinking about DNS. It's not sexy. It's an infrastructure service, and it's just supposed to work. 
  At BlueStripe, we work with many teams running applications that support millions of web requests a day. We keep seeing DNS delays and errors that the platform operations team never knows about. It's so common we've start calling it the  Hidden DNS Tax .
   What is the Hidden DNS Tax?     The Hidden DNS Tax is a hard-to-see performance hit your users take from DNS timeouts and errors in your back-end architecture. We've seen it bring down the main web application for a Fortune 10 company.</p><p>6 0.74632514 <a title="1335-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-13-AIDA%3A_Badoo%E2%80%99s_journey_into_Continuous_Integration.html">1531 high scalability-2013-10-13-AIDA: Badoo’s journey into Continuous Integration</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Jeffrey Damick , Principal Software Engineer for  Neustar .   Jeffrey has overseen the software architecture for  UltraDNS  for last two and half years as it went through substantial revitalization.  
 
UltraDNS is one the top the DNS providers, serving many  top-level domains (TLDs)  as well as  second-level domains (SLDs) .  This requires handling of several hundreds of thousands of zones with many containing millions of records each.  Even with all of its success UltraDNS had fallen into a rut several years ago, its release schedule had become haphazard at best and the team was struggling to keep up with feature requests in a waterfall development style.
  Development  
Realizing that something had to be done the team came together and identified the most important areas to attack first.  We began with the code base, stabilizing our flagship proprietary C++ DNS server, instituting common best practices and automation.   Testing was very manual and not easily</p><p>3 0.8779242 <a title="1335-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-25-Great_Open_Source_Solution_for_Boring_HA_and_Scalability_Problems.html">1522 high scalability-2013-09-25-Great Open Source Solution for Boring HA and Scalability Problems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post about how boring and repetitive HA and scalability problems can be solved via Open Source so you can focus on the interesting tasks. The post was written by  Maarten Ectors , responsible for Cloud Strategy and  Frank Mueller , a Juju Core developer, at  Ubuntu / Canonical . 
 
High-availability and scalability are exciting in general but there are certain problems that experts see over and over again. The list is long but examples are setting up MySQL clustering, sharding Mongo, adding data nodes to a Hadoop cluster, monitoring with Ganglia, building continuous deployment solutions, integrating Memcached / Varnish / Nginx,… Why are we reinventing the wheel?
 
At Ubuntu we made it our goal to have the community solve these repetitive and often boring tasks. How often have you had to set-up MySQL replication and scale it? What if the next time you just simply do:

 juju deploy mysql mysql-slave

Instagram uses a pastiche of different technologies and strategies.

<p>Introduction: It's been a well kept secret, but you may have heard  Facebook will Buy Photo-Sharing Service Instagram for $1 Billion . Just what is Facebook buying? Here's a quick gloss I did a little over a year ago on a presentation Instagram gave on their architecture. In that article I called Instagram's architecture the " canonical description of an early stage startup in this era." Little did we know how true that would turn out to be. If you want to learn how they did it then don't take a picture, just keep on reading...

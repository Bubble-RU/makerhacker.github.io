<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byNick Burling, VP of Product Management
ofBluestripe.Readers of High Scalability know are well versed in performance
optimization techniques. Reverse proxies, Varnish, Redis -- you hear about
them daily. But what you may not realize is that one of the oldest
technologies in your stack can be one of your biggest bottlenecks: DNS.People
don't spend a lot of time thinking about DNS. It's not sexy. It's an
infrastructure service, and it's just supposed to work.At BlueStripe, we work
with many teams running applications that support millions of web requests a
day. We keep seeing DNS delays and errors that the platform operations team
never knows about. It's so common we've start calling it theHidden DNS
Tax.What is the Hidden DNS Tax?The Hidden DNS Tax is a hard-to-see performance
hit your users take from DNS timeouts and errors in your back-end
architecture. We've seen it bring down the main web application for a Fortune

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byPatrick Eaton, Software Engineer and Distributed
Systems Architect at Stackdriver.Stackdriver provides intelligent monitoring-
as-a-service for cloud hosted applications.  Behind this easy-to-use service
is a large distributed system for collecting and storing metrics and events,
monitoring and alerting on them, analyzing them, and serving up all the
results in a web UI.  Because we ourselves run in the cloud (mostly on AWS),
we spend a lot of time thinking about how to deal with faults in the cloud.
We have developed a framework for thinking about fault mitigation for large,
cloud-hosted systems.  We endearingly call this framework the "Four Hamiltons"
because it is inspired by an article from James Hamilton, the Vice President
and Distinguished Engineer at Amazon Web Services.The article that led to this
framework is called "The Power Failure Seen Around the World".  Hamilton
analyzes the causes of the power outage that affected Super Bowl XLVII in
early 2013.</p><p>4 0.12214489 <a title="1335-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-17-How_the_AOL.com_Architecture_Evolved_to_99.999%25_Availability%2C_8_Million_Visitors_Per_Day%2C_and_200%2C000_Requests_Per_Second.html">1597 high scalability-2014-02-17-How the AOL.com Architecture Evolved to 99.999% Availability, 8 Million Visitors Per Day, and 200,000 Requests Per Second</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byDave HaglerSystems Architect at AOL.The AOL homepages
receive more than8 million visitors per day.  That's more daily viewers than
Good Morning America or the Today Show on television.  Over a billion page
views are served each month.  AOL.com has been a major internet destination
since 1996, and still has a strong following of loyal users.The architecture
for AOL.com is in it's 5th generation.  It has essentially been rebuilt from
scratch 5 times over two decades.  The current architecture was designed 6
years ago.  Pieces have been upgraded and new components have been added along
the way, but the overall design remains largely intact.  The code, tools,
development and deployment processes are highly tuned over 6 years of
continual improvement, making the AOL.com architecture battle tested and very
stable.The engineering team is made up of developers, testers, and operations

our organization on many levels - data center, software architecture,
development/deployment/operations, and, most importantly, within the culture
and organization. It is not enough to have a scalable data center, or a
scalable software architecture. The process of designing, coding, testing, and
deploying code also needs to be scalable. All of this starts with hiring and a

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byRan Grushkowsky, Head of Technology at
ATMCash.Virtualization and cloud-based systems are very hype in the industry;
however, most financial companies stray from those solutions. At ATMCash,
we've approached virtualization not for the usual reason of scalability, but
for the usually missed value of security.In this article, I will introduce the
concept of security added value in the utilization of virtualization and why
people should consider deploying mini-clouds for those use-cases. How do
virtual machines help mitigate risk?I am sure most of you have heard of the
recenthacking in the financial sector. Financial companies are under constant
hacking attempts and security is of the utmost importance. One of the bigger
risks in system deployment is a breach in one of the stack components. Regular
system patches and maintenance fix known exploits and issues, however,
sometimes it may be too late and the component has already been breached. If

<p>Introduction: John Zachman (Father of enterprise architecture)Given this renascent interest,
who better to explain the principles behind Enterprise Architecture than the
man himself, John Zachman, the originator of the " Zachman Framework for
Enterprise Architecture" Join this workshop in Johannesburg 25th Mar 09 and
Cape town in 27th March 09 and Mr.Zachman will explain how and why Enterprise
Architecture provides measure, such an implementation is a daunting task with
opportunities to fail lurking in many places.For more details visit

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byJeffrey Damick, Principal Software Engineer forNeustar.
Jeffrey has overseen the software architecture forUltraDNSfor last two and
half years as it went through substantial revitalization.UltraDNS is one the
top the DNS providers, serving manytop-level domains (TLDs)as well assecond-
level domains (SLDs). This requires handling of several hundreds of thousands
of zones with many containing millions of records each. Even with all of its
success UltraDNS had fallen into a rut several years ago, its release schedule
had become haphazard at best and the team was struggling to keep up with
feature requests in a waterfall development style.DevelopmentRealizing that
something had to be done the team came together and identified the most
important areas to attack first. We began with the code base, stabilizing our
flagship proprietary C++ DNS server, instituting common best practices and
automation. Testing was very manual and not easily reproducible, so we brought

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post about how boring and repetitive HA and scalability
problems can be solved via Open Source so you can focus on the interesting
tasks. The post was written byMaarten Ectors, responsible for Cloud Strategy
andFrank Mueller, a Juju Core developer, at Ubuntu/Canonical.High-availability
and scalability are exciting in general but there are certain problems that
experts see over and over again. The list is long but examples are setting up
MySQL clustering, sharding Mongo, adding data nodes to a Hadoop cluster,
monitoring with Ganglia, building continuous deployment solutions, integrating
Memcached / Varnish / Nginx,â&euro;Ś Why are we reinventing the wheel?At Ubuntu we
made it our goal to have the community solve these repetitive and often boring
tasks. How often have you had to set-up MySQL replication and scale it? What
if the next time you just simply do:juju deploy mysqljuju deploy mysql mysql-

<p>Introduction: Instagram is a free photo sharing and social networking service for your

over a year, they reached 150 million photos in August while amassing several

it uses a hybrid of SQL and NoSQL, it uses a ton of open source projects, they

<p>Introduction: It's been a well kept secret, but you may have heard Facebook will Buy Photo-
Sharing Service Instagram for $1 Billion. Just what is Facebook buying? Here's
a quick gloss I did a little over a year ago on a presentation Instagram gave
on their architecture. In that article I called Instagram's architecture the
"canonical description of an early stage startup in this era." Little did we
know how true that would turn out to be. If you want to learn how they did it
then don't take a picture, just keep on reading...  Instagram is a free photo

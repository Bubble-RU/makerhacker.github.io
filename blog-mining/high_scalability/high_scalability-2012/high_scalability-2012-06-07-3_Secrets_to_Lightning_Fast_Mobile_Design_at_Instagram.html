<p>Introduction: It's been a well kept secret, but you may have heard Facebook will Buy Photo-
Sharing Service Instagram for $1 Billion. Just what is Facebook buying? Here's
a quick gloss I did a little over a year ago on a presentation Instagram gave
on their architecture. In that article I called Instagram's architecture the
"canonical description of an early stage startup in this era." Little did we
know how true that would turn out to be. If you want to learn how they did it
then don't take a picture, just keep on reading...  Instagram is a free photo
sharing and social networking service for your iPhone that has been an instant
success. Growing to14 million usersin just over a year (now 30 million users),
they reached 150 million photos in August while amassing several terabytes of
photos, and they did this with just 3 Instaneers, all on the Amazon stack.The
Instagram team has written up what can be considered the canonical description
of an early stage startup in this era: What Powers Instagram:</p><p>4 0.14626461 <a title="1259-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-03-MocoSpace_Architecture_-_3_Billion_Mobile_Page_Views_a_Month.html">821 high scalability-2010-05-03-MocoSpace Architecture - 3 Billion Mobile Page Views a Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Jamie Hall, Co-founder & CTO ofMocoSpace, describing
the architecture for their mobile social network. This is a timely
architecture to learn from as it combines several hot trends: it is very
large, mobile, and social. What they think is especially cool about their
system is: how it optimizes for device/browser fragmentation on the mobile
Web; their multi-tiered, read/write, local/distributed caching system;
selecting PostgreSQL over MySQL as a relational DB that can scale.MocoSpace is
a mobile social network, with 12 million members and 3 billion page views a
month, which makes it one of the most highly trafficked mobile Websites in the
US. Members access the site mainly from their mobile phone Web browser,
ranging from high end smartphones to lower end devices, as well as the Web.
Activities on the site include customizing profiles, chat, instant messaging,
music, sharing photos & videos, games, eCards and blogs. The monetization
strategy is focused on advert</p><p>5 0.11944253 <a title="1259-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-29-20_New_Rules_for_Faster_Web_Pages.html">291 high scalability-2008-03-29-20 New Rules for Faster Web Pages</a></p>

WidSets widget that lets you better read HighScalability from your mobile
phone. I thought untethered readers might like to give it a try. Thanks to
Jean-Paul for making it available!WidSets is:a simple service that brings you
information normally accessed via the Internet by sending it directly to your
mobile phone . Using mini-applications called widgets, it sends you the latest
updates to your favorite websites. The system uses RSS feeds to push

<p>Introduction: Ilya Grigorik has written another wonderful article lavishly detailing the
extraordinary tactics Chrome employs to hide network latency from users:
Chrome Networking: DNS Prefetch & TCP Preconnect. Ilya springs some surpising
factoids on us, revealing how the web has slowed and super sized:The size of
an average page has grown to 1059kB and is now composed of over80 subresource
requests.An average DNS lookup takes between 60 and 120ms. This creates a
100-200ms of latency before a request can be sent because of th full round-
trip (RTT) to perform the TCP handshake.Slow mobile experiences are largely
due to the much higher RTT's (200-1000ms) on wireless networks. Reducing the
number of outbound connections and the total byte size of your pages is the
single best optimization you can make for mobile today. Chrome reduces
apparent latency using a host of clever anticipatory mechanisms:Learns the
network topology as you use it via a Predictor object that anticipates user
behavior and futur</p><p>5 0.59085751 <a title="1259-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-29-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_29%2C_2012_-_The_Velocity_Edition.html">1274 high scalability-2012-06-29-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 29, 2012 - The Velocity Edition</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Judging from the tweet flow, Velocitylooked like a riotous good time. In this
video on themain themes at Velocity, after a little microphone enhanced
violence, John Allspaw and Steve Souders identifyresilienceandautomationas two
of the big ideas behind building a faster and stronger web.John says
resiliency is the idea that we we don't live in a perfect world so trying to
build perfect systems is counter productive. We have to accept failure as a
baseline and think in terms of degrees of availability. All abstraction layers
leak so every part of a system must be monitorable and open to introspection.A
focus on resilience means the web is growing up. Resilience has long been a
requirement for "real" systems, it's great to see the web thinking in terms of
the complex systems they've always been. For the Alpha and Omega on resilience
you'll want to watchDr. Richard Cook'sinspiring talk on How Complex Systems
Fail. Here are some of the most enjoyable Quotable Quotes from

<p>Introduction: InSecrets to Lightning Fast Mobile Design, Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger
shares three strategies Instagram uses to outsmart high latency mobile
networks and make mobile apps feel faster than they really are, which helped
Instagram reach 12 million users in 12 months:The motivation:"mobile
experiences fill gaps while we wait. no one wants to wait while they
wait"Perform actions optimistically. Make the user feel productive. Likes,
comments, and follows are registered on screen while the like operation is
being sent in the background. Adaptively preload content. Load content before
it's needed. Don't images according to time, it will take too long, instead
re-prioritize based on interest. Show what the social network things is the
most popular. Listen to what your user's flicks and taps are telling you.Move
bits when no-one is watching.Picture uploading startsbeforeyou share them,
most apps wait until after the share screen. The rule is send data as soon as
it's ready, then match it</p><p>3 0.82404339 <a title="1259-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-17-Tachyon__-_Fault_Tolerant_Distributed_File_System_with_300_Times_Higher_Throughput_than_HDFS.html">1442 high scalability-2013-04-17-Tachyon  - Fault Tolerant Distributed File System with 300 Times Higher Throughput than HDFS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tachyon  (github) is interesting new filesystem brought to by the folks at
theUC Berkeley AMP Lab:Tachyon is a fault tolerant distributed ďŹ le system
enabling reliable file sharing at memory-speed across cluster frameworks, such
as Spark and MapReduce.It offers up to 300 times higher throughput than HDFS,
by leveraging lineage information and using memory aggressively. Tachyon
caches working set files in memory, and enables different jobs/queries and
frameworks to access cached files at memory speed. Thus, Tachyon avoids going
to disk to load datasets that is frequently read.It has a Java-like File API,
native support for raw tables, a pluggable file system, and it works with
Hadoop with no modifications. It might work well for streaming media too as
you wouldn't have to wait for the complete file to hit the disk before
rendering.Discuss on Hacker News</p><p>4 0.80448276 <a title="1259-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-10-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_10%2C_2011.html">1057 high scalability-2011-06-10-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 10, 2011</a></p>

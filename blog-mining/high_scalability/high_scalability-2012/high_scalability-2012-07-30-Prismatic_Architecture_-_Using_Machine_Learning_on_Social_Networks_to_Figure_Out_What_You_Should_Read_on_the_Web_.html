to Figure Out What You Should Read on the Web, Jason Wolfe, even in the face
of deadening fatigue from long nights spent getting their iPhone app out, has
gallantly agreed to talk a little more about Primatic's approach to Machine
Learning.Documents and users are two areas where Prismatic applies ML (machine

text of the page (rather than the sidebar, footer, comments, etc), its title,
author, best images, etcdetermine features for relevance (e.g., what the
article is about, topics, etc.)The setup for most of these tasks is pretty
typical. Models are trained using big batch jobs on other machines that read
data from s3, save the learned parameter files to s3, and then read (and

<p>Introduction: At some point as a programmer you might have the insight/fear that all
programming is just doing stuff to other stuff.Then you may observe after
coding the same stuff over again that stuff in a program often takes the form
of interacting patterns of flows.Then you may think hey, a program isn't only
useful for coding datastructures, but a program is a kind of datastructure and
that with a meta level jump you could program a program in terms of flows over
data and flow over other flows.That's the kind of stuff Prismatic is making
available in the Graph extension to their plumbing package (code examples),
which is described in an excellent post:Graph: Abstractions for Structured
Computation.You may remember Prismatic from previous profile we did on
HighScalability: Prismatic Architecture - Using Machine Learning On Social
Networks To Figure Out What You Should Read On The Web. We learned how
Prismatic, an interest driven content suggestion service, builds programs in
terms of graph stuff</p><p>4 0.17756839 <a title="1293-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-22-Facebook%27s_New_Realtime_Analytics_System%3A_HBase_to_Process_20_Billion_Events_Per_Day.html">1008 high scalability-2011-03-22-Facebook's New Realtime Analytics System: HBase to Process 20 Billion Events Per Day</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Facebook did it again. They've built another system capable of doing something
useful with ginormous streams of realtime data. Last time we saw Facebook
release their New Real-Time Messaging System: HBase To Store 135+ Billion
Messages A Month. This time it's a realtime analytics system handlingover 20
billion events per day (200,000 events per second) with a lag of less than 30
seconds. Alex Himel, Engineering Manager at Facebook, explains what they've
built (video) and the scale required:Social plugins have become an important
and growing source of traffic for millions of websites over the past year. We
released a new version of Insights for Websites last week to give site owners
better analytics on how people interact with their content and to help them
optimize their websites in real time. To accomplish this, we had to engineer a
system that could process over 20 billion events per day (200,000 events per
second) with a lag of less than 30 seconds. Alex does an excellent job with

<p>Introduction: On the surface nothing appears more different than soft data and hard raw
materials like iron. Then isn't itironic, in theAlanis Morissettesense, that
in this Age of Information, great wealth still lies hidden deep beneath piles
of stuff? It's so strange how directly digging for dollars in data parallels
the great wealth producing models of the Industrial Revolution.The piles of
stuff is the Internet. It takes lots of prospecting to find the right stuff.
Mighty web crawling machines tirelessly collect stuff, bringing it into their
huge maws, then depositing load after load into rack after rack of distributed
file system machines. Then armies of still other machines take this stuff and
strip out the valuable raw materials, which in the Information Age, are
endless bytes of raw data. Link clicks, likes, page views, content, head
lines, searches, inbound links, outbound links, search clicks, hashtags,
friends, purchases: anything and everything you do on the Internet is a
valuable raw mat</p><p>6 0.16317932 <a title="1293-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-13-Why_are_Facebook%2C_Digg%2C_and_Twitter_so_hard_to_scale%3F.html">721 high scalability-2009-10-13-Why are Facebook, Digg, and Twitter so hard to scale?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post onPrismatic's Architecture is adapted from an email conversation
with Prismatic programmerJason Wolfe.What should you read on the web today?
Any thoroughly modern person must solve this dilemma every day, usually using
some occult process to divine what's important in their many feeds: Twitter,
RSS, Facebook, Pinterest, G+, email, Techmeme, and an uncountable numbers of
other information sources.Jason Wolfe from Prismatic has generously agreed to
describe their thoroughly modern solution for answering the "what to read
question" using lots of sexy words like Machine Learning, Social Graphs,
BigData, functional programming, and in-memory real-time feed processing. The
result is possibly even more occult, but this or something very much like it
will be how we meet the challenge of finding interesting topics and stories
hidden inside infinitely deep pools of information.A couple of things stand
out about Prismatic. They want you to know that Prismatic is being built by a

<p>Introduction: Between love and madness lies HighScalability:Google now 10x better: MapReduce
sorts 1 petabyte of data using 8000 computers in 33 minutes; 1 Billion on
Social Networks;Tumblr at 10 Billion Posts;Twitter at 100 Million
Users;Testing at Google Scale: 1800 builds, 120 million test suites, 60
million tests run daily.From theDash Memoon Google's Plan:Go is a very
promising systems-programming language in the vein of C++. We fully hope and
expect that Go becomes the standard back-end language at Google over the next
few years.On GAE Go can load from a cold start in 100ms and the typical
instance size is 4MB. Is it any wonder Go is a go? Should we expect to see
Java and Python deprecated because Go is so much cheaper to run at
scale?Potent Quotables:@caciufo: 30x more scalability w/ many-core. So perf

Quotes:Thad Starner: the longer accessing a device exceeds 2s, the more its
actually usage would decrease exponentially. Thus, he made a claim that wrist

successful than mobile phones which have to pulled out of the pocket.
@joedevon: We came for scalability but we stayed for agility #NoSQL@jahmailay:

you do.smacktoward: The problem with relying on donations is that people don't
make donations.@toddhoffious: Programming is a tool built by logical
positivists to solve the problems of idealists and pragmatists. We have a
fundamental mismatch here.@etherealmind: Me: "Weird, my phone data isn't

<p>Introduction: OK, thisinterview is with meon Java scalability issues. I sound like a bigger
idiot than I would like, but I suppose it could have been worse. The Java
World folks were very nice and did a good job, so there's no blame on them
:-)The interview went an interesting direction, but there's more I'd like add
and I will do so here. Two major rules regarding Java and scalability have
popped out at me:Java - It's the platform stupid. Java the language isn't the
big win. What is the big win is the ecosystem building up around the JVM,
libraries, and toolsets.Java - It's the community stupid. A lot of creativity
is being expended on leveraging the Java platform to meet scalability
challenges. The amazing community that has built up around Java is pushing
Java to the next level in almost every direction imaginable.The fecundity of
the Java ecosystem can most readily be seen with the efforts to tame our
multi-core future. There's a multi-core crisis going in case you haven't

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Greg Luck Founder and CTO,EhcacheTerracotta Inc.Note:
this article contains a bit too much of a product pitch, but the points are
still generally valid and useful.The legendary Moore's Law, which states that
the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on an integrated
circuit doubles approximately every two years, has held true since 1965. It
follows that integrated circuits will continue to get smaller, with chip
fabrication currently at a minuscule 22nm process (1). Users of big iron
hardware, or servers that are dense in terms of CPU power and memory capacity,
benefit from this trend as their hardware becomes cheaper and more powerful
over time. At some point soon, however, density limits imposed by quantum
mechanics will preclude further density increases.At the same time, low-cost
commodity hardware influences enterprise architects to scale their
applications horizontally, where processing is spread across clusters of low-
cost commodity serv</p><p>6 0.14116517 <a title="1237-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-29-Strategy%3A_Exploit_Processor_Affinity_for_High_and_Predictable_Performance.html">1218 high scalability-2012-03-29-Strategy: Exploit Processor Affinity for High and Predictable Performance</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Martin Thompson wrote a really interestingarticleon the beneficial performance
impact of taking advantage of Processor Affinity:The interesting thing I've
observed is that the unpinned test will follow a step function of
unpredictable performance.  Across many runs I've seen different patterns but
all similar in this step function nature.  For the pinned tests I get
consistent throughput with no step pattern and always the greatest
throughput.The idea is by assigning a thread to a particular CPU that when a
thread is rescheduled to run on the same CPU, it can take advantage of the
"accumulated  state in the processor, including instructions and data in the
cache."  With multi-core chips the norm now, you may want to decide for
yourself how to assign work to cores and not let the OS do it for you. The
results are surprisingly strong.</p><p>3 0.82957911 <a title="1237-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-23-Strategy%3A_Use_Linux_Taskset_to_Pin_Processes_or_Let_the_OS_Schedule_It%3F.html">1536 high scalability-2013-10-23-Strategy: Use Linux Taskset to Pin Processes or Let the OS Schedule It?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This question comes from Ulysses on aninteresting threadfrom the Mechanical
Sympathy news group, especially given how multiple processors are now the
norm:Ulysses:On an 8xCPU Linux instance,  is it at all advantageous to use the
Linux taskset command to pin an 8xJVM process set (co-ordinated as a
www.infinispan.org distributed cache/data grid) to a specific CPU affinity set
(i.e. pin JVM0 process to CPU 0, JVM1 process to CPU1, ...., JVM7process to
CPU 7) vs. just letting the Linux OS use its default mechanism for
provisioning the 8xJVM process set to the available CPUs?In effrort to seek an
optimal point (in the full event space), what are the conceptual trade-offs in
considering "searching" each permutation of provisioning an 8xJVM process set
to an 8xCPU set via taskset?Giventaskset is they key to the question, it would

<p>Introduction: It's not often you get so enthusiastic a recommendation for a paper as Sergio
Bossa gives Memory Barriers: a Hardware View for Software Hackers: If you only
want to read one piece about CPUs architecture, cache coherency and memory
barriers, make it this one.It is a clear and well written article. It even has
a quiz. What's it about?So what possessed CPU designers to cause them to
inﬂict memory barriers on poor unsuspecting SMP software designers?In short,
because reordering memory references allows much better performance, and so
memory barriers are needed to force ordering in things like synchronization
primitives whose correct operation depends on ordered memory
references.Getting a more detailed answer to this question requires a good
understanding of how CPU caches work, and especially what is required to make
caches really work well. The following sections:present the structure of a
cache,describe how cache-coherency protocols ensure that CPUs agree on the
value of each location</p><p>5 0.81111985 <a title="1237-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-09-10-Russ%E2%80%99_10_Ingredient_Recipe_for_Making_1_Million_TPS_on_%245K_Hardware.html">1319 high scalability-2012-09-10-Russ’ 10 Ingredient Recipe for Making 1 Million TPS on $5K Hardware</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My name isRussell Sullivan, I am the author of AlchemyDB: a highly flexible
NoSQL/SQL/DocumentStore/GraphDB-datastore built on top of redis. I have spent
the last several years trying to find a way to sanely house multiple
datastore-genres under one roof while (almost paradoxically) pushing
performance to its limits.I recently joined the NoSQL
companyAerospike(formerly Citrusleaf) with the goal of incrementally grafting
AlchemyDB's flexible data-modeling capabilities onto Aerospike's high-velocity
horizontally-scalable key-value data-fabric. We recently completed a peak-
performanceTPS optimization project: starting at 200K TPS, pushing to the
recent community edition launch at 500K TPS, and finally arriving at our 2012
goal:1M TPS on $5K hardware.Getting to one million over-the-wire client-server
database-requests per-second on a single machine costing $5K is a balance
between trimming overhead on many axes and using a shared nothing architecture

<p>Introduction: Martin Thompson, a high-performance technology geek, has written an awesome
post,Fun with my-Channels Nirvana and Azul Zing. In it Martin shows the
process and techniques he used to take an existing messaging product, written
in Java, and increase throughput by 32X and reduce latency by  20X. The
article is very well written with lots of interesting details that make it
well worth reading.The TechniquesThe techniques are a good mix of Java
independent approaches, things you may have heard of before, things you
probably haven't heard of  before, and Java specific heroics. The obvious
winning technique is to create a lock free flow through the system. This
shouldn't be surprising as Martin teaches what sounds like a really goodlock-
free concurrency course.Do not use locks in the main transaction flow because
they cause context switches, and therefore latency and unpredictable
jitter.Never have more threads that need to run than you have cores
available.Set affinity of threads to cores,</p><p>2 0.94445008 <a title="1237-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-10-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_10%2C_2013.html">1455 high scalability-2013-05-10-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 10, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update: More background by Ikai Lan, who worked on the mobile server team at
LinkedIn, sayssome facts were left out: the app made "a cross data center
request, guys. Running on single-threaded Rails servers (every request blocked
the entire process), running Mongrel, leaking memory like a sieve." Which
explains why any non-blocking approach would be a win. And Ikai, I hope as you
do that nobody reads HS and just does what somebody else does without
thinking. The goal here is information that you can use to make your own
decisions. Ryan Paul has written an excellent behind-the-scenes look at
LinkedIn's mobile engineering. While the mobile part of the story--23% mobile
usage; focus on simplicity, ease of use, and reliability; using a room
metaphor; 30% native, 80% HTML; embedded lightweight HTTP server; single
client-app connection--could help guide your mobile strategy, the backend
effects of moving from Rails to Node.js may also prove interesting. After

<p>Introduction: We talked about 42 Monster Problems That Attack As Loads Increase. And inThe
Aggregation Collection we talked about the value of prioritizing work and
making smart queues as a way of absorbing and not reflecting traffic
spikes.Now we move on to our next batch of strategies where the theme
isconditioning, which is the idea of shaping and controlling flows of work
within your application...Use Resources Proportional To a Fixed LimitThis is
probably the most important rule for achieving scalability within an
application. What it means:Find the resource that has a fixed limit that you
know you can support. For example, a guarantee to handle a certain number of
objects in memory. So if we always use resources proportional to the number of
objects it is likely we can prevent resource exhaustion.Devise ways of tying
what you need to do to the individual resources.Some examples:Keep a list of
purchase orders with line items over $20 (or whatever). Do not keep a list of
the line items because t</p><p>5 0.93618608 <a title="1237-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-03-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_3%2C_2012.html">1297 high scalability-2012-08-03-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 3, 2012</a></p>

was needed for scale. Now, scalability and flexibility (variability) can
coexist. #FOL2012@adrianco: Compared to vanilla EBS many times better for

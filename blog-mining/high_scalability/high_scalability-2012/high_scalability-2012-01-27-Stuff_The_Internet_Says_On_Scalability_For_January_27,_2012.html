<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.   Let's take a short trip down web architecture lane:
  It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl scripts and a SQL database   It's 1995: Scale-up the database.   It's 1998: LAMP   It's 1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SAN   It's 2001: In-memory data-grid.   It's 2003: Add a caching layer.   It's 2004: Add scale-out and partitioning.   It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a distributed file system.   It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.

 The cloud isn't for closers.  Another gaming startup pulls back from the cloud  by Derrick Harris. Digital Chocolate is following the Zynga strategy of moving games into higher performing datacenter infrastructure once it becomes popular enough in the cloud to justify the primo stuff. We talked about this strategy in  Zynga's Z Cloud - Scale Fast Or Fail Fast By Merging Private And Public Clouds . An architectural approach made all the more sensible with Amazon's new  AWS Direct Connect  service, which enables lower latency and higher bandwidth services by skipping the Internet and connecting directly to the AWS network.  AWS Direct Connect FAQs .  Amazon Virtual Private Cloud .

  The unbearable cost of the cloud?   @marcoarment : My experiment with Amazon CloudSearch was going very well until I imported half of subscribers' bookmarks and saw it would cost $10k/month. 
  @JBossMike : Serious question: Do the Node.js hipsters enjoy not knowing WTF they're talking about when they talk about software scalability? 
  @timoelliott : The #Fashion industry doesn't have #bigdata -- they call it size XXL data instead...

<p>Introduction: Yes, I just got through watching the Superbowl so chips and salsa are on my mind and in my stomach. In recreational eating more chips requires downing more salsa. With mulitcore chips it turns out as cores go up salsa goes down, salsa obviously being a metaphor for speed.     Sandia National Laboratories found in their simulations:   a significant increase in speed going from two to four multicores, but an insignificant increase from four to eight multicores. Exceeding eight multicores causes a decrease in speed. Sixteen multicores perform barely as well as two, and after that, a steep decline is registered as more cores are added. The problem is the lack of memory bandwidth as well as contention between processors over the memory bus available to each processor.      The implication for those following a diagonal scaling strategy is to work like heck to make your system fit within eight multicores. After that you'll need to consider some sort of partitioning strategy.

<p>Introduction: This post is by  Hasan Ceylan , an Open Source software enthusiast from Istanbul. 
 
I loved the JPA 1.0 back in early 2000s. I started using it together with EJB 3.0 even before the stable releases. I loved it so much that I contributed bits and parts for JBoss 3.x implementations.
  Those were the days our company was considerably still small in size. Creating new features and applications were more priority than the performance, because there were a lot of ideas that we have and we needed to develop and market those as fast as we can. Now, we no longer needed to write tedious and error prone xml descriptions for the data model and deployment descriptors. Nor we needed to use the curse called “XDoclet”.  On the other side, our company grew steadily, our web site has become the top portal in the country for live events and ticketing. We now had the performance problems! Although the company grew considerably, due to the economics in the industry, we did not make a lot of money.

<p>Introduction: Stanford Info Lab is taking pains to document a direction we've been moving for a while now, using RAM not just as a cache, but as the primary storage medium. Many  quality products  have built on this model. Even if the vision isn't radical, the paper does produce a lot of data backing up the transition, which is in itself helpful. From the The Abstract:   
 Disk-oriented approaches to online storage are becoming increasingly problematic: they do not scale grace-fully to meet the needs of large-scale Web applications, and improvements in disk capacity have far out-stripped improvements in access latency and bandwidth. This paper argues for a new approach to datacenter storage called RAMCloud, where information is kept entirely in DRAM and large-scale systems are created by aggregating the main memories of thousands of commodity servers. We believe that RAMClouds can provide durable and available storage with 100-1000x the throughput of disk-based systems and 100-1000x lower access lat</p><p>6 0.82034421 <a title="1182-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-18-Risk_Analysis_on_the_Cloud_%28Using_Excel_and_GigaSpaces%29.html">470 high scalability-2008-12-18-Risk Analysis on the Cloud (Using Excel and GigaSpaces)</a></p>

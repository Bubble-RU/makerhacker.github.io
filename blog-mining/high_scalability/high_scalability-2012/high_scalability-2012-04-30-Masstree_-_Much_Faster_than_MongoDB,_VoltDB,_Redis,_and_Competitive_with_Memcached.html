</p><p>2 Some data is protected by other nodes' locks, however. [sent-12, score-0.114]
</p><p>3 A node's parent pointer is protected by its parent's lock, and a border node's prev pointer is protected by its previous sibling's lock. [sent-13, score-0.559]
</p><p>4 This minimizes the simultaneous locks required by split operations; when an interior node splits, for example, it can assign its children's parent pointers without obtaining their locks. [sent-14, score-0.416]
</p><p>5 Should support range queries, skewed key popularity, small K-V pairs, many puts, and arbitrary keys. [sent-17, score-0.173]
</p><p>6 Their first attempt was a fast binary tree, achieving 3. [sent-18, score-0.061]
</p><p>7 In fact, when looking at local performance (without network/disk bottlenecks), cache craftiness results in a 1. [sent-24, score-0.239]
</p><p>8 To reduce DRAM latency, they constructed a lock-free, unbalanced 4-way tree with the same concurrency properties as a binary tree, but is only half as deep for the same amount of data -- plus each node fits into a cache line. [sent-28, score-0.798]
</p><p>9 It turns out, however, that the B+tree is 11% slower than the 4-way tree (because of cache line optimization, and since all nodes are full, while for their B+tree, only ~75% are)! [sent-31, score-0.489]
</p><p>10 However, there are consistency issues with concurrent inserts in the B+tree (not with 4-way, as keys don't move), so pre-pend a "permuter" (index list array) to each node, so we can atomically swap keys around. [sent-33, score-0.468]
</p><p>11 But there is an issue with long keys -- they require multiple memory accesses, and throughput drops rapidly as keys get longer. [sent-34, score-0.398]
</p><p>12 So they use a Trie of B+trees, with each level (B+tree) responsible for 8 bytes of key length. [sent-35, score-0.058]
</p><p>13 "Masstree" is the union of all these optimizations (I think), and despite having a trie of B+trees in it, it is 8% more efficient than a single B+tree with all the other optimizations. [sent-37, score-0.159]
</p><p>14 Masstree uses a single, shared key that is accessed by all cores (presumably using the OCC+versioning techniques they alluded to). [sent-41, score-0.196]
</p><p>15 They also find that they scale fairly well to 16 cores (about ⅕ drop in performance over perfect scalability). [sent-43, score-0.086]
</p><p>16 Its design pays particular attention to concurrency and to efﬁciency for short and simple queries. [sent-45, score-0.106]
</p><p>17 Masstree keeps all data in memory in a tree, with fanout chosen to minimize total DRAM delay when descending the tree with prefetching. [sent-46, score-0.437]
</p><p>18 The tree is shared among all cores to preserve load balance when key popularities are skewed. [sent-47, score-0.582]
</p><p>19 It maintains high concurrency using optimistic concurrency control for lookup and local locking for updates. [sent-48, score-0.275]
</p><p>20 For good performance for keys with long shared preﬁxes, a Masstree consists of a trie-like concatenation of B+ trees, each of the latter supporting only ﬁxed-length keys for efﬁciency. [sent-49, score-0.501]

<p>Introduction: If a large number of leaf node machines send requests to a central root node
then that root node can become overwhelmed:The CPU becomes a bottleneck, for
either processing requests or sending replies, because it can't possibly deal
with the flood of requests.The network interface becomes a bottleneck because
a wide fan-in causes TCP drops and retransmissions, which causes latency. Then
clients start retrying requests which quickly causes a spiral of death in an
undisciplined system.One solution to this problem is a strategy given by Dr.
Jeff Dean, Head of Google's School of Infrastructure Wizardry, in this
Stanford video presentation:Tree Distribution of Requests and
Responses.Instead of having a root node connected to leaves in a flat
topology, the idea is to create a tree of nodes. So a root node talks to a
number of parent nodes and the parent nodes talk to a number of leaf nodes.
Requests are pushed down the tree through the parents and only hit a subset of
the leaf nodes.With this</p><p>3 0.18285078 <a title="1236-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-20-The_Performance_of_Distributed_Data-Structures_Running_on_a_%22Cache-Coherent%22_In-Memory_Data_Grid.html">1307 high scalability-2012-08-20-The Performance of Distributed Data-Structures Running on a "Cache-Coherent" In-Memory Data Grid</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ron Pressler, the founder and CEO ofParallel Universe,
a Y Combinator company building advanced middleware for real-time
applications.A little over a month ago, we open-sourced a new in-memory data
grid calledGalaxy. An in-memory data grid, or IMDG, is a clustered data
storage and processing middleware that uses RAM as the authoritative and
primary storage, and distributes data over a cluster for purposes of data and
processing scalability and high-availability. A common feature of IMDGs is co-
location of code and data, meaning that application code runs on all cluster
nodes, each instance processing those data items residing in the local node's
RAM.While quite a few commercial and open-source IMDGs are available (like
Terracotta, Gigaspaces, Oracle Coherence, GemFire, Websphere eXtreme Scale,
Infinispan and Hazelcast), Galaxy has adopted a completely different
architecture from all other IMDGs, to service some usage scenarios ill-fitted
to the other solutions.</p><p>4 0.13152705 <a title="1236-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-07-Scale_Indefinitely_on_S3_With_These_Secrets_of_the_S3_Masters.html">1205 high scalability-2012-03-07-Scale Indefinitely on S3 With These Secrets of the S3 Masters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a great article, Amazon S3 Performance Tips & Tricks, Doug Grismore,
Director of Storage Operations for AWS, has outed the secret arcana normally
reserved for Premium Developer Support customers on how to really use S3:Size
matters. Workloads with less than 50-100 total requests per second don't
require any special effort. Customers that routinely perform thousands of
requests per second need a plan.Automated partitioning. Automated systems
scale S3 horizontally by continuously splitting data into partitions based on
high request rates and the number of keys in a partition (which leads to slow
lookups). Lessons you've learned with sharding may also apply to S3.   Avoid
hot spots. Like most sharding schemes, you want to avoid hot spots by the
smart selection of key names. S3 objects are stored inbuckets.  Each object is
identified using a key. Keys are kept in sorted order. Keys in S3 are
partitioned by prefix. Objects that sort together are stored together, so you
want to select key</p><p>5 0.12142841 <a title="1236-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-04-Top_Features_of_a_Scalable_Database.html">1276 high scalability-2012-07-04-Top Features of a Scalable Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Douglas Wilson, EMEA Field Application Engineer at
Raima, based on insights from biulding theirRaima Database Manager.Scalability
and HardwareScalability is the ability to maintain performance as demands on
the system increase, by adding further resources. Normally those resources
will be in the form of hardware. Since processor speeds are no longer
increasing much, scaling up the hardware normally means adding extra
processors or cores, and more memory.Scalability and SoftwareHowever,
scalability requires software that can utilize the extra hardware effectively.
The software must be designed to allow parallel processing. In the context of
a database engine this means that the server component must be multi-threaded,
to allow the operating system to schedule parallel tasks on all the cores that
are available. Not only that, but the database engine must provide an
efficient way to break its workload into as many parallel tasks as there are
cores.

<p>Introduction: If you stayed up all night watching the life reaffirmingCuriosity landing on
Mars, then this paper,High-Performance Concurrency Control Mechanisms for
Main-Memory Databases, has nothing to do with that at all, but it is an
excellent look at how to use optimistic MVCC schemes to reduce lock overhead
on in-memory datastructures:A database system optimized for in-memory storage
can support much higher transaction rates than current systems. However,
standard concurrency control methods used today do not scale to the high
transaction rates achievable by such systems. In this paper we introduce two
efficient concurrency control methods specifically designed for main-memory
databases. Both use multiversioning to isolate read-only transactions from
updates but differ in how atomicity is ensured: one is optimistic and one is
pessimistic. To avoid expensive context switching, transactions never block
during normal processing but they may have to wait before commit to ensure
correct serializatio</p><p>3 0.74831271 <a title="1236-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-29-Performance_data_for_LevelDB%2C_Berkley_DB_and_BangDB_for_Random_Operations.html">1364 high scalability-2012-11-29-Performance data for LevelDB, Berkley DB and BangDB for Random Operations</a></p>

following embedded databases under various scenarios for random operations
such as write and read. The data is presented in graphical manner to make the

storage library written at Google that provides an ordered mapping from string
keys to string values. Leveldb is based on LSM (Log-Structured Merge-Tree) and
uses SSTable and MemTable for the database implementation. It's written in C++
and availabe under BSD license. LevelDB treats key and value as arbitrary byte
arrays and stores keys in ordered fashion. It uses snappy compression for the
data compression. Write and Read are concurrent for the db, but write performs
best with single thread whereas Read scales with number of

<p>Introduction: We are not yet at the End of History for database theory asPeter Bailisand
theDatabase Groupat UC Berkeley continue to prove with a greatcompanion blog
post to their new paper: Scalable Atomic Visibility with RAMP Transactions. I
like the approach of pairing a blog post with a paper. A paper almost by
definition is formal, but a blog post can help put a paper in context and give
it some heart.From the abstract:Databases can provide scalability by
partitioning data across several servers. However, multi-partition, multi-
operation transactional access is often expensive, employing coordination-
intensive locking, validation, or scheduling mechanisms. Accordingly, many
real-world systems avoid mechanisms that provide useful semantics formulti-
partition operations. This leads to incorrect behavior for a large class of

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ron Pressler, the founder and CEO ofParallel Universe,
a Y Combinator company building advanced middleware for real-time
applications.A little over a month ago, we open-sourced a new in-memory data
grid calledGalaxy. An in-memory data grid, or IMDG, is a clustered data
storage and processing middleware that uses RAM as the authoritative and
primary storage, and distributes data over a cluster for purposes of data and
processing scalability and high-availability. A common feature of IMDGs is co-
location of code and data, meaning that application code runs on all cluster
nodes, each instance processing those data items residing in the local node's
RAM.While quite a few commercial and open-source IMDGs are available (like
Terracotta, Gigaspaces, Oracle Coherence, GemFire, Websphere eXtreme Scale,
Infinispan and Hazelcast), Galaxy has adopted a completely different
architecture from all other IMDGs, to service some usage scenarios ill-fitted
to the other solutions.</p><p>6 0.71992987 <a title="1236-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-31-Paper%3A_Everything_You_Always_Wanted_to_Know_About_Synchronization_but_Were_Afraid_to_Ask.html">1541 high scalability-2013-10-31-Paper: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Synchronization but Were Afraid to Ask</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Sun FireTM X4540 Server as Backup Server for Zmanda's Amanda Enterprise 2.6
Softwareby Thomas Hanvey (Sun Microsystems) and Dmitri Joukovski and Ken
Crandall (Zmanda)September, 2008Explosive data growth, combined with demanding
requirements for data availability, has placed a tremendous burden on IT
operations staff at businesses of all sizes. Yet, many organizations do not
have the staff or budget to purchase and manage complex and expensive backup
and recovery software products.The Sun FireTM X4540 server can deliver massive
storage capacity and remarkable throughput so it is well-suited as a nearline
storage platform for backup and restore applications. Combining the power of
the SolarisTM 10 Operating System with the data integrity and simplified
administration of ZFS, the Sun Fire X4540 server can be an ideal candidate for
streamlining and improving backup and restore operations.Amanda Enterprise
Edition from Zmanda was designed to address these challenges, providing a

<p>Introduction: Snoozeis an open-source, scalable, autonomic, and energy-efficient virtual
machine (VM) management framework for private clouds. Similarly to other VM
management frameworks such as Nimbus, OpenNebula, Eucalyptus, and OpenStack it
allows to build compute infrastructures from virtualized resources.
Particularly, once installed and configured users can submit and control the
life-cycle of a large number of VMs. However, contrary to existing frameworks
for scalability and fault tolerance, Snooze employs a self-organizing and
healing (based on Apache ZooKeeper) hierarchical architecture. Moreover, it
performs distributed VM management and is designed to be energy efficient.
Therefore, it implements features to monitor and estimate VM resource (CPU,
memory, network Rx, network Tx) demands, detect and resolve overload/underload
situations, perform dynamic VM consolidation through live migration, and
finally power management to save energy. Last but not least, it integrates a
generic scheduler</p><p>5 0.86851078 <a title="1236-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-26-Paper%3A_Wikipedia%27s_Site_Internals%2C_Configuration%2C_Code_Examples_and_Management_Issues.html">134 high scalability-2007-10-26-Paper: Wikipedia's Site Internals, Configuration, Code Examples and Management Issues</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wikipedia andWikimediahave some of the best, most complete real-world
documentation on how to build highly scalable systems. This paper by Domas
Mituzas covers a lot of details about how Wikipedia works, including: an
overview of the different packages used (Linux, PowerDNS, LVS, Squid,
lighttpd, Apache, PHP5, Lucene, Mono, Memcached), how they use their CDN, how
caching works, how they profile their code, how they store their media, how
they structure their database access, how they handle search, how they handle
load balancing and administration. All with real code examples and examples of
configuration files. This is a really useful resource.Related

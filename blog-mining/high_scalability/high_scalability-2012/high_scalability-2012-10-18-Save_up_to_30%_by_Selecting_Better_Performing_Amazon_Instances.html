<p>Introduction: Vaibhav PuranikinWeb serving in the cloud - our experiences with nginx and
instance sizesdescribes their experience trying to maximum traffic and minimum
their web serving costs on EC2. Initially they tested with two m1.small
instance types and then they the switched to two c1.mediums instance types.
The m1s are the standard instance types and the c1s are the high CPU instance
types. Obviously the mediums have greater capability, but the cost difference
was interesting:In the long term they will save money using the larger
instances and not autoscaling. With the small instances, traffic bursts caused
autoscaling to kick in. New instances were started in response to load. The
instances woud be up for a short period of time and then spin down again. This
constant churn costs a lot of money. Selecting the larger instance sizes,
which are capable of handling the load without autoscaling, turn out to save
money even though they are more expensive. Starting new instances also takes a

<p>Introduction: Nothing shows how much software architectures have changed than the
intelligent scheduling of computation over differently priced compute
resources. This isn't just a false economy either. Vimeo saves up to 50% on
their video transcoding bill by intelligently playing the spot, reserved, and
on-demand markets. If you are ready for some advanced reindeer games then take
a look at  Vimeo EC2 transcoding where they explain their thinking. Even if
you don't like their rules, it's the strategy that matters. This presentation
was from 2011, so it would be interesting to see if the new reserved instance
market has made a difference in their strategy. Here's Vimeo's approach for
minimizing costs using spot, reserved, and on-demand instances:Never bid more
than threshold. It is currently set to 80% of on-demand price.Not more than 10
open spot requests at any time.Bid 10% more than the average price over last

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byShawn Hsiao,Luke Massa, andVictor Luu. Shawn
runsTripAdvisor's Technical Operations team, Luke and Victor interned on his
team this past summer. This post is introduced byAndy Gelfond, TripAdvisor's
head of engineering.It's been a little over a year since our last post about
theTripAdvisor architecture. It has been an exciting year. Our business and
team continues to grow, we are now an independent public company, and we have
continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown -
we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work
across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:56M visitors per
month350M+ pages requests a day120TB+ of warehouse data running on a large
Hadoop cluster, and quickly growingWe also had a very successful college
intern program that brought on over 60 interns this past summer, all who were

<p>Introduction: Are all instances created equal? Perhaps because under multi-tenancy multiple
virtual machines run on the same physical host, not all applications will run
equally well on every instance. In that case it makes sense to measure and
move to a better performing instance. That's the interesting idea
from@botchagalupe:Imagine something like a "performance monkey" where an
infrastructure is so bound that it can kill lower performing instances
automatically.@adriancosays Netflix has throught of doing the same: We've

Certified Solution Architect and Purveyor of fluxcapacitor.com.Ahead of the
upcoming 2nd annual re:Invent conference, inspired by Simone Brunozzi's
recentpresentationat an AWS Meetup in San Francisco, and collected from a few
of my recentFluxcapacitor.com consulting engagements, I've compiled a list of
10 useful time and clock-tick saving tips about AWS.1) Query AWS resource
metadata Can't remember the EBS-Optimized IO throughput of your c1.xlarge
cluster?  How about the size limit of an S3 object on a single PUT?
awsnow.infois the answer to all of your AWS-resource metadata questions.
Interested in integrating awsnow.info with your application?  You're in luck.
There's now aREST API, as well!Note:  These are default soft limits and will
vary by account.2) Tame your S3 buckets Delete an entire S3 bucket with a

<p>Introduction: If you like the idea of exploiting market inconsistencies to lower your costs
then you will love thispaperand video from the Hot Cloud '12
conference:Exploiting Hardware Heterogeneity within the Same Instance Type of
Amazon EC2.The conclusion is interesting and is a source of good
guidance:Amazon EC2 uses diversified hardware to host the same type of
instance.  The hardware diversity results in performance variation.In general,
the variation between the fast instances and slow  instances can reach 40%. In
some applications, the variation can even approach up to 60%.  By selecting
fast instances within the same instance type,  Amazon EC2 users can acquire up
to 30% of cost saving, if the fast instances have a relatively low
probability.The abstract:Cloud computing providers might start with near-
homogeneous hardware environment. Over time, the homogeneous environment will
most likely evolve into heterogeneous one because of possible upgrades and
replacement of outdated hardware. In tur</p><p>2 0.86232942 <a title="1343-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-18-Database_War_Stories_%233%3A_Flickr.html">282 high scalability-2008-03-18-Database War Stories #3: Flickr</a></p>

<p>Introduction: TheIsilon IQfamily of clustered storage systems was designed from the ground
up to meet the needs of data-intensive enterprises and high-performance
computing environments. By combining Isilon's OneFS® operating system software
with the latest advances in industry-standard hardware, Isilon delivers
modular, pay-as-you-grow, enterprise-class clustered storage systems. OneFS,
with TrueScale™ technology, powers the industry's first and only storage
system that enables linear or independent scaling of performance and capacity.
This new flexible and tunable system, featuring a robust suite of clustered
storage software applications, provides customers with an "out of the box"
solution that is fully optimized for the widest range of applications and
workflow needs.* Scales from 4 TB ti 1 PB* Throughput of up to 10 GB per
seond* Linear scaling* Easy to manageRelated Articles Inside Skinny On

<p>Introduction: It's called "east-west" networking, which when compared to its predecessor,
"north-south" networking, evinces images of maelstroms and hurricane winds and
tsunamis for some reason. It could be the subtle correlation between the
transformative shift this change in networking patterns has on the data center
with that of El Ni単o's transformative power upon the weather patterns across
the globe.Traditionally, data center networks have focused on North-South
network traffic. The assumption is that clients on the edge would mainly
communicate with servers at the core, rather than across the network to other
clients.But server virtualization changes all this, with servers, virtual
appliances and even virtual desktops scattered across the same physical
infrastructure. These environments are also highly dynamic, with workloads
moving to different physical locations on the network as virtual servers are
migrated (in the case of data center networks) and clients move about the
building (in the ca</p><p>6 0.78047478 <a title="1343-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-23-Behind_The_Scenes_of_Google_Scalability.html">309 high scalability-2008-04-23-Behind The Scenes of Google Scalability</a></p>

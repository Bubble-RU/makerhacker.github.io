</p><p>5 OPERATIONAL CONSISTENCYOne of the biggest negatives to a hybrid architectural approach to cloud computing is the lack ofoperational consistency. [sent-10, score-0.545]
</p><p>6 While enterprise systems may be unified and managed via a common platform, resources and delivery services in the cloud are managed using very different systems and interfaces. [sent-11, score-0.428]
</p><p>7 This poses a challenge for all of IT, but is particularly an impediment to those responsible for devops - for integrating and automating provisioning of the application delivery services required to support applications. [sent-12, score-0.389]
</p><p>8 It requires diverse sets of skills - often those peculiar to developers such as programming and standards knowledge (SOAP, XML) - as well as those traditionally found in the data center. [sent-13, score-0.157]
</p><p>9 " - Allan Leinwand, Zynga's Infrastructure CTO Other bottlenecks were found in the networks to storage systems, Internet traffic moving through Web servers, firewalls' ability to process the streams of traffic, and load balancers' ability to keep up with constantly shifting demand. [sent-17, score-0.234]
</p><p>10 Zynga uses Citrix SystemsCloudStack as its virtual machine management interface superimposed on all zCloud VMs, regardless of whether they're in the public cloud or private cloud. [sent-18, score-0.689]
</p><p>11 Amazon security groups are not easily codified in enterprise-class systems, and vice-versa. [sent-20, score-0.08]
</p><p>12 Thus if hybrid cloud is to become the architectural model of choice, it becomes necessary to unify operations across all environments - whether public or enterprise. [sent-22, score-1.053]
</p><p>13 UNIFIED OPERATIONSWe are seeing this demand more and more, as enterprise organizations seek out ways to integrate cloud-based resources into existing architectures to support a variety of business needs - disaster recover, business continuity, and spikes in application demand. [sent-23, score-0.377]
</p><p>14 What customers are demanding is a unified approach to integrating those resources, which means infrastructure providers must be able to offer solutions that can be deployed both in a traditional enterprise-class model as well as a public cloud environment. [sent-24, score-1.056]
</p><p>15 This is also true for organizations that may have started in the cloud but are now moving to a hybrid model in order to seize control of the infrastructure as a means to address performance bottlenecks that simply cannot be addressed by cloud providers due to the innate nature of a shared model. [sent-25, score-1.182]
</p><p>16 This ability to invoke and coordinate both private and public clouds is "the hidden jewel" of Zynga's success, says Allan Leinwand, CTO of infrastructure engineering at the company. [sent-26, score-0.487]
</p><p>17 --Lessons From FarmVille: How Zynga Uses The Cloud While much is made of Zynga's "reverse cloud-bursting" business model, what seems to be grossly overlooked is the conspecificity of infrastructure required in order to move seamlessly between the two worlds. [sent-27, score-0.386]
</p><p>18 Whether at the virtualization layer or at the delivery infrastructure layer, a consistent model of operations is a must to transparently take advantage of the business benefits inherent in a cross-environment, aka hybrid, cloud model of deployment. [sent-28, score-0.886]

<p>Introduction: Release early and often. A/B testing. Creating a landing page and buying ads
on AdSense. All are ways of providing quick feedback in order to validate an
idea. If you are like Zynga, with 250 million active users a month, how do you
cost effectively prove out a game that could flop or get 90 million users
(like CityVille) in an instant?Zynga handles this problem inlle an innovative
way, by inverting the typical cloud burst scenario that has excess traffic
flowing from a datacenter to a cloud, to having a game start in the cloud and
then moving to the datacenter once the game has proved popular enough to
keep.This process is nicely described by Charles Babcock in Lessons From
FarmVille: How Zynga Uses The Cloud, in an interview with Allan Leinwand, CTO
of infrastructure engineering at Zynga.When paired down to its essence,
Zynga's strategy goes something like this:Games are risky.  Even with all
their experience, Zynga can't know how many people will play a game or how

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byFrederic Faure(architect atYsance)on the differences
between using a cloud infrastructure and building your own. Frederic was kind
enough to translate the original French version of this article into
English.I've been noticing many questions about the differences inherent in
choosing between a Cloud infrastructure such asAWS(Amazon Web Services) and a
traditional physical infrastructure. Firstly, there are a certain number of
preconceived notions on this subject that I will attempt to decode for you.
Then, it must be understood that each infrastructure has its advantages and
disadvantages: a Cloud-type infrastructure does not necessarily fulfill your
requirements in every case, however, it can satisfy some of them by optimizing
or facilitating the features offered by a traditional physical infrastructure.
I will therefore demonstrate the differences between the two that I have
noticed, in order to help you make up your own mind.The FrameworkCloudThere

<p>Introduction: With all the attention being paid these days to VDI (virtual desktop
infrastructure) and application virtualization and server virtualization andvirtualization it's easy to forget about network-based
application virtualization. But it's the one virtualization technique
youshouldn'tforget because it is a foundational technology upon which myriad
other solutions will be enabled.WHAT IS NETWORK-BASED APPLICATION
VIRTUALIZATION?This term may not be familiar to you but that's because since
its inception oh, more than a decade ago, it's always just been called "server
virtualization". After the turn of the century (I love saying that, by the
way) it was always referred to asservice virtualizationinSOAand XML circles.
With the rise of the likes of VMware and Citrix and Microsoft server
virtualization solutions, it's become impossible to just use the term "server
virtualization" and "service virtualization" is just as ambiguous so it seems
appropriate to give it a few more modif</p><p>6 0.15736756 <a title="1212-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-14-Private-Public_Cloud.html">444 high scalability-2008-11-14-Private-Public Cloud</a></p>

sh%# - now I have ten thousand servers and I need to consolidate server and
datacenter operations!Is Cloud Computing going to follow the same path?As a
technology strategist I have the benefit of frequently speaking with other
CIO's on the topic of Cloud Computing. Often those discussions are in context
to how they can leverage SpringCM' s easy, fast and affordable cloud
Enterprise Content Management (ECM) services. But those conversations are done
in context to the overall strategy and reality that the modern CIO will use a
combination of cloud offerings to solve business problems today. Some of those
services will be internally provided (Private Cloud), and many more will be
outside the traditional corporate domain, also known as Public Cloud
services.What options do I have?In a recent conversation with a CIO

<p>Introduction: Data centers are reshaping themselves by taking ideas from public cloud
providers, such as Amazon and Google. The idea is to make the data center more
cost-effective by enabling on-demand utility-based computing rather than
dedicated machines. At the same time, it is clear that to make IT operations
more effective, it doesn't make sense to run all the applications that are
currently hosted in a company's data center in the private cloud. This calls
for an integration between private and public cloud. In this post i discuss
some of the challenges involved in making that happen:1. How do we design
applications to be cloud-agnostic?2. How do we enable seamless fail-over to a
public cloud?3. Future-proofing: There are many cases in which we can't make a
clear decision as to where our application should be running at the time of

<p>Introduction: One of the benefits of web applications is that they are generally
transported via TCP, which is a connection-oriented protocol designed to
assure delivery. TCP has a variety of native mechanisms through which delivery
issues can be addressed - from window sizes to selective acks to idle time
specification to ramp up parameters. All these technical knobs and buttons
serve as a way for operators and administrators to tweak the protocol, often
at run time, to ensure the exchange of requests and responses upon which web
applications rely. This is unlike UDP, which is more of a "fire and forget"
protocol in which the server doesn't really care if you receive the data or
not.Now, voice and streaming video and audio over the web has always leveraged
UDP and thus it has always been highly sensitive to jitter. Jitter is, without
getting into layer one (physical) jargon, an undesirable delay in the
otherwise consistent delivery of packets. It causes the delay of and sometimes
outright loss of p</p><p>5 0.79788446 <a title="1212-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-16-The_VeriScale_Architecture_-_Elasticity_and_efficiency_for_private_clouds.html">706 high scalability-2009-09-16-The VeriScale Architecture - Elasticity and efficiency for private clouds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The modern datacenter is evolving into the network centric datacenter model,
which is applied to both public and private cloud computing. In this model,
networking, platform, storage, and software infrastructure are provided as
services that scale up or down on demand. The network centric model allows the
datacenter to be viewed as a collection of automatically deployed and managed
application services that utilize underlying virtualized services. Providing
sufficient elasticity and scalability for the rapidly growing needs of the
datacenter requires these collections of automatically-managed services to
scale efficiently and with essentially no limits, letting services adapt
easily to changing requirements and workloads. Sun's VeriScale architecture
provides the architectural platform that can deliver these capabilities. Sun
Microsystems has been developing open and modular infrastructure architectures
for more than a decade. The features of these architectures, such as
elasticity, ar</p><p>6 0.79341084 <a title="1212-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-15-Cloud_Bursting_between_AWS_and_Rackspace.html">1264 high scalability-2012-06-15-Cloud Bursting between AWS and Rackspace</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I am working on the design for my database and can't seem to come up with a
firm schema. I am torn between normalizing the data and dealing with the
overhead of joins and denormalizing it for easy sharding. The data is
essentially music information per user: UserID, Artist, Album, Song. This
lends itself nicely to be normalized and have separate User, Artist, Album and
Song databases with a table full of INTs to tie them together. This will be in
a mostly read based environment and with about 80% being searches of data by
artist album or song. By the time I begin the query for artist, album or song
I will already have a list of UserID's to limit the search by. The problem is
that the tables can get unmanageably large pretty quickly and my plan was to
shard off users once it got too big. Given this simple data relationship what
are the pros and cons of normalizing the data vs denormalizing it? Should I go
with 4 separate, normalized tables or one 4 column table? Perhaps it might be
best</p><p>2 0.92188567 <a title="1212-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-15-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_November_15th%2C_2013.html">1549 high scalability-2013-11-15-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For November 15th, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This question was asked over email and I thought a larger audience might want
to take a whack at it.I have a problem I'd like to have your view on. I've
looked around a lot, and I haven't found a definite answer. The question is
this:Is it true that for a scalable web-based system targeting millions of
users (hopefully), using Microsoft technology(.Net/SQL Server) over open
source technologies like python/ruby/php and mysql (mariadb) / postgresql will
cost you more? Is there any justification for paying up for Microsoft
licenses(OS, SQL Server, â&euro;Ś)?I am in charge of selecting the technology toolbox
for a startup which is going to build a scalable public web platform. I've
worked as a developer and database developer/admin (mainly as a DBA) using
different platforms and technologies, but my main focus is on Microsoft
technology. I've considered all other important factors for this decision, and
at the end, I always come back to the question of money. When I finish

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-
grid.It's 2003: Add a caching layer.It's 2004: Add scale-out and
partitioning.It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a
distributed file system.It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.It's 2008: Cloud

<p>Introduction: Arvid Norbergon thelibtorrent bloghas put together an excellent list
ofprinciples of high performance programs, obviously derived from hard won
experience programming on bittorrent:Two fundamental causes of performance
problems:Memory Latency. A big performance problem on modern computers is the
latency of SDRAM. The CPU waits idle for a read from memory to come
back.Context Switching. When a CPU switches context "the memory it will access
is most likely unrelated to the memory the previous context was accessing.
This often results in significant eviction of the previous cache, and requires
the switched-to context to load much of its data from RAM, which is
slow."Rules to help balance the forces of evil:Batch work. Avoid context
switching by batching work. For example, there are vector versions of system
calls like writev() and readv() that operate on more than one item per call.
An implication is that you want to merge as many writes as possible.Avoid
Magic Numbers. They don't scale.</p><p>6 0.13118289 <a title="1187-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-13-In_Memoriam%3A_Lavabit_Architecture_-_Creating_a_Scalable_Email_Service.html">1501 high scalability-2013-08-13-In Memoriam: Lavabit Architecture - Creating a Scalable Email Service</a></p>

<p>Introduction: At the heart of every software adventure exists a journey in service of a
quest. Melodramatic much? Sorry, but while wandering dazzled throughRace to
the End of the Earth, a fantastic exhibit at theRoyal BC Museumon the
1911-1912race to the South Polebetween Norwegian explorerRoald Amundsenand
British naval officerRobert Scott, I couldn't help but think of the two
radically different approaches each team took to the race and it shocked me to
see that some of the same principles that lead to success or failure in
software development also seem to lead to success or failure in exploration.I
wish I could reproduce the experience ofwalking through the exhibit. Plaque
after plaque I remember wondering out loud at Scott's choices and then nod in
agreement with Amundsen's approach. The core conflict was straight out of any
ancient Agile (Amundsen) vs Waterfall (Scott) thread you can find on Usenet.
And Waterfall lost.As background here are some sources you may want to read to

<p>Introduction: eAcceleratoris a free open-source PHP accelerator, optimizer, and dynamic
content cache. It increases the performance of PHP scripts by caching them in
their compiled state, so that the overhead of compiling is almost completely
eliminated. It also optimizes scripts to speed up their execution.
eAccelerator typically reduces server load and increases the speed of your PHP
code by 1-10 times.</p><p>4 0.88631123 <a title="1187-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-16-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_16%2C_2012.html">1210 high scalability-2012-03-16-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 16, 2012</a></p>

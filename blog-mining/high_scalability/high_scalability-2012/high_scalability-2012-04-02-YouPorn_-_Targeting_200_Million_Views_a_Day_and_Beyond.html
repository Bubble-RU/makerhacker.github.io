<p>Introduction: With the introduction of  Redis  your options in the key-value space just grew and your choice of which to pick just got a lot harder. But when you think about it, that's not a bad position to be in at all.  Redis (REmote DIctionary Server) -  a key-value database. It's similar to memcached but the dataset is not volatile, and values can be strings, exactly like in memcached, but also lists and sets with atomic operations to push/pop elements.   The key points are: open source; speed (benchmarked performing 110,000 SET operations, and 81,000 GETs, per second); persistence, but in an asynchronous way taking everything in memory; support for higher level data structures and atomic operations.  The home page is well organized so I'll spare the excessive-copying-to-make-this-post-longer. For a good overview of Redis take a look at Antonio Cangiano's article:  Introducing Redis: a fast key-value database .  If you are looking at a way to understand how Redis is different than something like</p><p>4 0.19802274 <a title="1220-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-06-11_Common_Web_Use_Cases_Solved_in_Redis.html">1074 high scalability-2011-07-06-11 Common Web Use Cases Solved in Redis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  How to take advantage of Redis just adding it to your stack  Salvatore 'antirez' Sanfilippo shows how to solve some common problems in Redis by taking advantage of its unique data structure handling capabilities. Common Redis primitives like LPUSH, and LTRIM, and LREM are used to accomplish tasks programmers need to get done, but that can be hard or slow in more traditional stores. A very useful and practical article. How would you accomplish these tasks in your framework?
  
  Show latest items listings in your home page . This is a live in-memory cache and is very fast.  LPUSH  is used to insert a content ID at the head of the list stored at a key.  LTRIM  is used to limit the number of items in the list to 5000. If the user needs to page beyond this cache only then are they sent to the database. 
  Deletion and filtering . If a cached article is deleted it can be removed from the cache using  LREM .

Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.    We're basically using a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget). Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text, author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.    I'm wondering if we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to g</p><p>6 0.15694107 <a title="1220-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-15-Simpler%2C_Cheaper%2C_Faster%3A_Playtomic%27s_Move_from_.NET_to_Node_and_Heroku.html">1340 high scalability-2012-10-15-Simpler, Cheaper, Faster: Playtomic's Move from .NET to Node and Heroku</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ben Lowry, CEO of  Playtomic . Playtomic is a game analytics service implemented in about 8000 mobile, web and downloadable games played by approximately 20 million people daily. 
 
 Here's a good summary quote by  Ben Lowry on Hacker News : 
  
 Just over 20,000,000 people hit my API yesterday 700,749,252 times, playing the ~8,000 games my analytics platform is integrated in for a bit under 600 years in total play time. That's just yesterday. There are lots of different bottlenecks waiting for people operating at scale. Heroku and NodeJS, for my use case, eventually alleviated a whole bunch of them very cheaply. 
  
Playtomic began with an almost exclusively Microsoft.NET and Windows architecture which held up for 3 years before being replaced with a complete rewrite using NodeJS.  During its lifetime the entire platform grew from shared space on a single server to a full dedicated, then spread to second dedicated, then the API server was offloaded to a VPS pro</p><p>4 0.70541942 <a title="1220-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-06-11_Common_Web_Use_Cases_Solved_in_Redis.html">1074 high scalability-2011-07-06-11 Common Web Use Cases Solved in Redis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  How to take advantage of Redis just adding it to your stack  Salvatore 'antirez' Sanfilippo shows how to solve some common problems in Redis by taking advantage of its unique data structure handling capabilities. Common Redis primitives like LPUSH, and LTRIM, and LREM are used to accomplish tasks programmers need to get done, but that can be hard or slow in more traditional stores. A very useful and practical article. How would you accomplish these tasks in your framework?
  
  Show latest items listings in your home page . This is a live in-memory cache and is very fast.  LPUSH  is used to insert a content ID at the head of the list stored at a key.  LTRIM  is used to limit the number of items in the list to 5000. If the user needs to page beyond this cache only then are they sent to the database. 
  Deletion and filtering . If a cached article is deleted it can be removed from the cache using  LREM . 
  Leaderboards and related problems . A leader board is a set sorted by score.</p><p>5 0.67384773 <a title="1220-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-19-Product%3A_Redis_-_Not_Just_Another_Key-Value_Store.html">545 high scalability-2009-03-19-Product: Redis - Not Just Another Key-Value Store</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With the introduction of  Redis  your options in the key-value space just grew and your choice of which to pick just got a lot harder. But when you think about it, that's not a bad position to be in at all.  Redis (REmote DIctionary Server) -  a key-value database. It's similar to memcached but the dataset is not volatile, and values can be strings, exactly like in memcached, but also lists and sets with atomic operations to push/pop elements.   The key points are: open source; speed (benchmarked performing 110,000 SET operations, and 81,000 GETs, per second); persistence, but in an asynchronous way taking everything in memory; support for higher level data structures and atomic operations.  The home page is well organized so I'll spare the excessive-copying-to-make-this-post-longer. For a good overview of Redis take a look at Antonio Cangiano's article:  Introducing Redis: a fast key-value database .

<p>Introduction: With the  Chapultepec aqueduct , also named  the great aqueduct , the  Aztecs  built a novel uninterruptible water supply for providing fresh water to  Tenochtitlan , their fast growing jewel of a capital city. A section of the aqueduct is still around today: 
 
     
 
It's fun to think about how even 600 years ago how it was built with high availability in mind. We find  engineers being engineers , no matter the age:
  

It consisted of a twin pipe distribution system made in part of compacted soil and in part of wood for the crossings of the aqueduct over the bridges built to allow the passage of the canoes. It was finished around 1466 AD, and the main purpose was to supply fresh water to Mexico-Tenochtitlan, to mitigate its thirst.


The main source for the aqueduct was the spring of Chapultepec and the purpose of the twin pipes was to ease the maintenance of the system, because the water was conveyed through one pipe, and when it got dirty, the water was diverted to the other pipe</p><p>2 0.91752416 <a title="1220-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-10-MONO_ASP.NET._Will_it_make_the_web%3F%3F%3F.html">206 high scalability-2008-01-10-MONO ASP.NET.

<p>Introduction: Update : Here's the  video of the talk .
 
  Erick Pickup  , lead developer at YouPorn.com, presented their architecture in a talk titled   Building a Website To Scale   given at the   ConFoo   conference.  As you might expect, YouPorn is a beast, streaming three full DVDs of video every second, handing 300K queries every second, and generating up to 15GBs of log data per hour.  Unfortunately, all we have are the slides of the talk, so this article isn’t as technical as I might like, there’s no visibility at all on the video handling for example, but we do get some interesting details.  The most interesting takeway is that YouPorn is a pretty conventional LAMP stack, with a NoSQL twist as Redis now replaces MySQL in the live datapath. Reminds me a little of   YouTube   in its simplicity.   The second most interesting takeaway was the  great switchover . Common wisdom says never rewrite, but in 2011 YouPorn rewrote their entire site to use PHP + Redis instead of a complex Perl + MySQL b</p><p>4 0.90014327 <a title="1220-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-17-IBM_WebSphere_eXtreme_Scale_%28IMDG%29.html">542 high scalability-2009-03-17-IBM WebSphere eXtreme Scale (IMDG)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: IBM WebSphere eXtreme Scale is IBMs in memory data grid product (IMDG). It can be used as a key-value store which partitions the keys (using a form of consistent hashing) over a set of servers such that each server is responsible for a subset of the keys. It automatically handles replication which can be either synchronous of asynchronous and handles advanced placement so that replicas can be placed in different physical zones when compared to the placement of the primary. Think buildings, racks, floor, data centers.     It is fully elastic in that servers can be added and removed and it automatically redistributes the partition primaries and backups. It can be scaled from one server to hundreds if not thousands of JVMs in a single grid. Each additional server provides more CPU, memory capacity and network and it scales linearly with grid growth.     It also has a key-graph mode where a graph of objects can be associated with a single key and it allows fine grained modification of that</p><p>5 0.89998513 <a title="1220-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-29-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_29%2C_2012_-_The_Velocity_Edition.html">1274 high scalability-2012-06-29-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 29, 2012 - The Velocity Edition</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Judging from the tweet flow,  Velocity  looked like a riotous good time. In this video on the  main themes  at Velocity, after a little microphone enhanced violence, John Allspaw and Steve Souders identify  resilience  and  automation  as two of the big ideas behind building a faster and stronger web.
 
John says resiliency is the idea that we we don't live in a perfect world so trying to build perfect systems is counter productive. We have to accept failure as a baseline and think in terms of degrees of availability. All abstraction layers leak so every part of a system must be monitorable and open to introspection.
 
A focus on resilience means the web is growing up. Resilience has long been a requirement for "real" systems, it's great to see the web thinking in terms of the complex systems they've always been. For the Alpha and Omega on resilience you'll want to watch  Dr. Richard Cook's  inspiring talk on  How Complex Systems Fail .

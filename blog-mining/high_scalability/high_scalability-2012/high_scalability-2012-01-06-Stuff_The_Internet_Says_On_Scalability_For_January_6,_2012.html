<p>Introduction: We are serving dynamic (PHP) websites and their assets
(JS/CSS/images/videos/binary downloads) via the same apache hosts. The static
files are only being used as origins for CDN services used to distribute those
files. Yet, in the current development-deploy pipeline, these files are
checked into the same version control repositories as the code is. This is
what we would like to change, for several reasons (decouple asset deployment
from development & developers, lessen size of code repositories, etc.)My idea
is to do the following: Set up a media server (cluster) which serves as an API
(REST e.g.). You can PUT files to it, and get back the URL the file is
available through from the public. In between input and output, the media
service deals with everything that's necessary to serve the files: Upload them
to the CDN, create the public URL, write the meta data to a (relational?)
database, assign a version number... This API can be used by a) the
application/website directly to provide C</p><p>5 0.1355336 <a title="1170-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_Akamai.html">39 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: Akamai</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Akamaitransparently mirrors content (usually media objects such as audio,
graphics, animation, video) stored on customer servers. Though the domain name
is the same, the IP address points to an Akamai server rather than the
customer's server.In addition to image caching, Akamai provides services which
accelerate dynamic and personalized content, J2EE-compliant applications, and

<p>Introduction: My apologies if you were looking for a post about cell phones. This post is
about high density nanodevices. It's a follow up toHow will memristors change
everything? for those wishing to pursue these revolutionary ideas in more
depth. This is one of those areas where if you are in the space then there's a
lot of available information and if you are on the outside then it doesn't
even seem to exist. Fortunately, Ben Chandler from The SyNAPSE Project, was
kind enough to point me to a great set of presentations given at the12th IEEE
CNNA - International Workshop on Cellular Nanoscale Networks and their
Applications- Towards Megaprocessor Computing. WARNING: these papers contain
extreme technical content. If you are like me and you aren't an electrical
engineer, much of it may make a sort of surface sense, but the deep and twisty
details will fly over head. For the more software minded there are a couple
more accessible presentations:Intelligent Machines built with Memristive

<p>Introduction: With the Chapultepec aqueduct, also namedthe great aqueduct, theAztecsbuilt a
novel uninterruptible water supply for providing fresh water to Tenochtitlan,
their fast growing jewel of a capital city. A section of the aqueduct is still
around today: It's fun to think about how even 600 years ago how it was built
with high availability in mind. We findengineers being engineers, no matter
the age:It consisted of a twin pipe distribution system made in part of
compacted soil and in part of wood for the crossings of the aqueduct over the
bridges built to allow the passage of the canoes. It was finished around 1466
AD, and the main purpose was to supply fresh water to Mexico-Tenochtitlan, to
mitigate its thirst.The main source for the aqueduct was the spring of
Chapultepec and the purpose of the twin pipes was to ease the maintenance of
the system, because the water was conveyed through one pipe, and when it got
dirty, the water was diverted to the other pipe while the dirty pipe was
cleaned</p><p>same-blog 2 0.86813295 <a title="1170-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-06-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_6%2C_2012.html">1170 high scalability-2012-01-06-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 6, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Judging from the tweet flow, Velocitylooked like a riotous good time. In this
video on themain themes at Velocity, after a little microphone enhanced
violence, John Allspaw and Steve Souders identifyresilienceandautomationas two
of the big ideas behind building a faster and stronger web.John says
resiliency is the idea that we we don't live in a perfect world so trying to
build perfect systems is counter productive. We have to accept failure as a
baseline and think in terms of degrees of availability. All abstraction layers
leak so every part of a system must be monitorable and open to introspection.A
focus on resilience means the web is growing up. Resilience has long been a
requirement for "real" systems, it's great to see the web thinking in terms of
the complex systems they've always been. For the Alpha and Omega on resilience
you'll want to watchDr. Richard Cook'sinspiring talk on How Complex Systems
Fail. Here are some of the most enjoyable Quotable Quotes from

<p>Introduction: A thoughtful reader recently suggested creating a series of posts based on
real-life problems people have experienced and the solutions they've created
to slay the little beasties. It's a great idea. Often we learn best from great
trials and tribulations. I'll start off the new "Problem Report"feature with a
diabolical little problem I dubbed the "Mobbing the Least Used Resource
Error." Please post your own. And if you know someone with an interesting
problem report, please tag them too. It could be a lot of fun. Of course, feel
free to scrub your posts of all embarrassing details, but be sure to keep the
heroic parts in :-)The ProblemThere's an unexpected and frequently fatal type
of error that can happen when new resources are added to a horizontally scaled
architecture. Because the new resource has the least of something, load or
connections or whatever, a load balancer configured with a least metric will
instantaneously direct all new traffic to that new resource. And bam! Your

This totally requires a scale-up strategy.Facebook at60,000 serversand
counting.Deepak Singh has collected some impressivemassive datastats on
extreme Hadoop usage: Facebook: 36 PB of uncompressed data, 2250 machines,
23,000 cores, 32 GB of RAM per machine, processing 80-90TB/day; Yahoo: 70 PB
of data in HDFS, 170 PB spread across the globe, 34000 servers, Processing 3
PB per day, 120 TB flow through Hadoop every day;Twitter: 7 TB/day into HDFS;
LinkedIn: 120 Billion relationships; 82 Hadoop jobs daily (IIRC); 16 TB of
intermedia data.Who knew DevOps could be so funny? Adam Jacob, CTO of Opscode,
gave ahilarious talkat the Velocity conference on the true nature of DevOps.

belly may ache from laughing so much.Pig at LinkedIn. Not your average

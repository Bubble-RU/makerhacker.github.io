<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve?

<p>Introduction: There's a deep similarity between how long running systems like our brains and
computers accumulate errors and repair themselves. Reboot it. Isn't that the
common treatment for most computer ailments? And you may have noticed now that
your iPhone supports background processing it reboots a lot more often? Your
DVR, phone, computer, router, car, and an untold number of long running
computer systems all suffer from a nasty problem: over time they accumulate
flaws and die or go crazy.Now think about your brain. It's a long running
program running on very complex and error prone hardware. How does your brain
keep itself sane over time? The answer may be found in something we spend a
third of our lives doing. Sleep.There's new research out on how our brains are
cleansed during sleep that has some interesting parallels to how we keep long
running hardware-software systems up and running properly. This is a fun
topic. Let's explore it a little more.One of the most frustrating system tests

<p>Introduction: Although the problem of scaling human genome sequencing is not exactly about
building bigger, faster and more reliable websites it is most interesting in
terms of scalability. Thepaperdescribes a new technology by the startup
company Complete Genomics to sequence the full human genome for the fraction
of the cost of earlier possibilities.Complete Genomics is building the world's
largest commercial human genome sequencing center to provide turnkey,
outsourced complete human genome sequencing to customers worldwide.By 2010,
their data center will contain approximately 60,000 processors with 30
petabytes of storage running their sequencing software on Linux clusters.Do

<p>Introduction: InNoSQL: Past, Present, FutureEric Brewerhas a particularly fine section on
explaining the often hard to understand ideas ofBASE(Basically Available, Soft
State, Eventually Consistent),ACID(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation,
Durability),CAP(Consistency Availability, Partition Tolerance), in terms of a
pernicious long standing myth about the sanctity of consistency in
banking.Myth: Money is important, so banksmustuse transactions to keep money
safe and consistent, right?Reality: Banking transactions are inconsistent,
particularly for ATMs. ATMs are designed to have a normal case behaviour and a
partition mode behaviour. In partition mode Availability is chosen over
Consistency.Why?1)Availability correlates with revenue and consistency
generally does not.2)Historically there was never an idea of perfect
communication so everything was partitioned.Your ATM transaction must go
through so Availability is more important than consistency. If the ATM is down
then you aren't making money.

<p>Introduction: It's HighScalability Time:Quotable Quotes:@dbasch: The world is full of
"scalability engineers" who would die from an orgasm if their software ever
saw 10,000 requests in a day.@mtnygard: "Scaling issues are always expressed
as a queue backing up somewhere." --@moonpolysoft #strangeloop@rbranson: If
your data fits in main memory, you're doing it wrong. #strangeloop@peakscale:
Using schemaless DBs an "overreaction" & "confuses the poor impl. of schemas
with the value that schemas provide"@adrianco: GM: Performance analysis is
complicated by your brain thinking LINEARLY about a computer system that is
NONLINEAR. @littleidea: it's better to have infinite scalability and not need
it, than to need infinite scalability and not have itLooks like Google is on
the right track with their language understanding efforts. How hierarchical is

nanometer Tri-Gate transistors)Quotable Quotes:@pbailis: Big ups to AWS folks
for following up re: all of my questions on cr1 provisioning. We saw a huge
win moving from m1.xl to cr1.8xl@rob_carlson: Packet switching via containers

I now have no idea what you're talking about@KentBeck: If you can't make
engineering decisions based on data, then make engineering decisions that
result in data.@cassandralondon: Cassandra on AWS SSDs - a perfect fit because
you don't get write amplification If you think about it, a cloud as a rule
driven, capability rich environment, accessible over a large surfaced API,
plays the same role as physics in biology. Software must specify every little

<p>Introduction: A lot of apps need to map IP addresses to locations. Jeremy Cole inOn
efficiently geo-referencing IPs with MaxMind GeoIP and MySQL GISsuccinctly
explains the many uses for such a feature:Geo-referencing IPs is, in a
nutshell, converting an IP address, perhaps from an incoming web visitor, a
log file, a data file, or some other place, into the name of some entity
owning that IP address. There are a lot of reasons you may want to geo-
reference IP addresses to country, city, etc., such as in simple ad targeting
systems, geographic load balancing, web analytics, and many more
applications.This is difficult to do efficiently, at least it gives me a bit
of brain freeze. In the same post Jeremy nicely explains where to get the geo-
rereferncing data, how to load data, and the performance of different
approaches for IP address searching. It's a great practical introduction to
the subject.</p><p>6 0.91627765 <a title="1330-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-17-Some_Services_are_More_Equal_than_Others.html">944 high scalability-2010-11-17-Some Services are More Equal than Others</a></p>

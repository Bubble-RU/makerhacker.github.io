<p>Introduction: Google recently released apaper on Spanner, their planet enveloping tool for
organizing the world's monetizable information. Reading the Spanner paper I
felt it had that chiseled in stone feel that all of Google's best papers have.
An instant classic. Jeff Dean foreshadowed Spanner's humungousness as early
as2009.  Now Spanner seems fully online, just waiting to handle "millions of
machines across hundreds of datacenters and trillions of database rows."
Wow.The Wise have yet to weigh in on Spanner en masse. I look forward to more
insightful commentary. There's a lot to make sense of. What struck me most in
the paper was a deeply buried section essentially describing Google's
motivation for shifting away from NoSQL and toNewSQL. The money quote:We
believe it is better to have application programmers deal with performance
problems due to overuse of transactions as bottlenecks arise, rather than
always coding around the lack of transactions.This reads as ironic given

<p>Introduction: I've been getting asked about this a lot lately so I figured I'd just blog
about it. Products like WebSphere eXtreme Scale work by taking a dataset,
partitioning it using a key and then assigning those partitions to a number of
JVMs. Each partition usually has a primary and a replica. These 'shards' are
assigned to JVMs. A transactional application typically interacts with the
data on a single partition at a time. This means the transaction is executed
in a single JVM. A server box will be able to do M of those transactions per
second and it scales because N boxes does MN (M multiplied by N) transactions
per second. Increase N, you get more transactions per second. Availability is
very good because a transaction only depends on 1 of the N servers that are
currently online. Any of the other (N-1) servers can go down or fail with no
impact on the transaction. So, single partition transactions can scale
indefinitely from a throughput point of view, offer very consistent response
times and</p><p>6 0.18394049 <a title="1345-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Are_Cloud_Based_Memory_Architectures_the_Next_Big_Thing%3F.html">538 high scalability-2009-03-16-Are Cloud Based Memory Architectures the Next Big Thing?</a></p>

many the strong guarantees of standard RDBMSdistributed transactionsare too

which hopes to serve up a heaping bowl ofrich database functionality and low

system for Yahoo!'s web applications. PNUTS provides data storage organized as
hashed or ordered tables, low latency for large numbers of con-current

<p>Introduction: Teams fromPrincetonand CMU areworking togetherto solve one of the most
difficult problems in the repertoire: scalable geo-distributed data stores.
Major companies like Google and Facebook have been working on multiple
datacenter database functionality for some time, but there's still a general
lack of available systems that work for complex data scenarios.The ideas in
this paper--Don't Settle for Eventual: Scalable Causal Consistency for Wide-
Area Storage with COPS--are different. It's not another eventually consistent
system, or a traditional transaction oriented system, or a replication based
system, or a system that punts on the issue. It's something new, a causally
consistent system that achievesALPSsystem properties. Move over CAP, NoSQL,
etc, we have another acronym: ALPS - Available (operations always complete
successfully), Low-latency (operations complete quickly (single digit
milliseconds)), Partition-tolerant (operates with a partition), and Scalable

<p>Introduction: Can you have your ACID cake and eat your distributed database too? Yes
explains Daniel Abadi, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Yale
University, in an epic post,The problems with ACID, and how to fix them
without going NoSQL, coauthored with Alexander Thomson, on their paperThe Case
for Determinism in Database Systems. We've already seenVoltDBoffer the best of
both worlds, this sounds like a completely different approach.The solution,
they propose, is: ...an architecture and execution model that avoids deadlock,
copes with failures without aborting transactions, and achieves high
concurrency. The paper contains full details, but the basic idea is to use
ordered locking coupled with optimistic lock location prediction, while
exploiting deterministic systems' nice replication properties in the case of
failures.The problem they are trying to solve is:In our opinion, the NoSQL
decision to give up on ACID is the lazy solution to these scalability and
replication issues.

<p>Introduction: What do you get when you take a SQL database and start a new implementation
from scratch, taking advantage of the latest research and modern hardware?
Mike Stonebraker, the sword wielding Johnny Appleseed of the database world,
hopes you get something like his new database,VoltDB: a pure SQL, pure ACID,
pure OLTP, shared nothing, sharded, scalable, lockless, open source, in-memory
DBMS, purpose-built for running hundreds of thousands of transactions a
second. VoltDBclaims to be100 times faster than MySQL, up to 13 times faster
thanCassandra, and 45 times faster than Oracle, with near-linear scaling.Will
VoltDB kill off the new NoSQL upstarts? Will VoltDB cause a mass extinction of
ancient databases? Probably no and no to both questions, but it's a product
with a definite point-of-view and is worth a look as the transaction component
in your system. But will it be right for you? Let's see...I first heard the
details about VoltDB at Gluecon, where Mr. Stonebraker presented his highly

<p>Introduction: A lot of people seem to passionately dislike the termNewSQL, or pretty much
any newly coined term for that matter, but after watching Alex Lloyd, Senior
Staff Software Engineer Google, give a great talkon Building Spanner, that's
the term that fits Spanner best.Spanner wraps the SQL + transaction model of
OldSQL around the reworked bones of a globally distributed NoSQL system. That
seems NewSQL to me.As Spanner is a not so distant cousin of BigTable, the
NoSQL component should be no surprise. Spanner is charged with spanning
millions of machines inside any number of geographically distributed
datacenters. What is surprising is how OldSQL has been embraced. In anearlier
2011 talkgiven by Alex at the HotStorage conference, the reason for embracing
OldSQL was the desire to make it easier and faster for programmers to build
applications. The main ideas will seem quite familiar:There's a false
dichotomy between little complicated databases and huge, scalable, simple
ones. We can have featur</p><p>3 0.96264911 <a title="1345-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-21-Google_AppEngine_-_A_Second_Look.html">517 high scalability-2009-02-21-Google AppEngine - A Second Look</a></p>

what Google must do to fix itby Aral Balkan.We don't care that it can scale.
We care that it does scale. And that it scales when you need it the
most.Issues: 1MB limit on data structures; 1MB limit on data structures; the
short-term high CPU quota; quotas in general; Admin? What's that?Update 3:
BigTableBlues. Catherine Devlin couldn't port an application to GAE because it
can't do basic filtering and can't search 5,000 records without timing out:
"Querying from 5000 records - too much for the mighty BigTable, apparently."

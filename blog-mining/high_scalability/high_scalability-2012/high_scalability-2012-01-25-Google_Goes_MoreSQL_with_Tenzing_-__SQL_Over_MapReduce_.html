<p>Introduction: Update:   MapReduce and PageRank Notes from Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau's Fall 2008 class  . Collects interesting facts about MapReduce and PageRank. For example, the history of the solution to searching for the term "flu" is traced through multiple generations of technology.   With Google entering the cloud space with  Google AppEngine  and a maturing  Hadoop  product, the MapReduce scaling approach might finally become a standard programmer practice. This is the best paper on the subject and is an excellent primer on a content-addressable memory future.  Some interesting stats from the paper: Google executes 100k MapReduce jobs each day; more than 20 petabytes of data are processed per day; more than 10k MapReduce programs have been implemented; machines are dual processor with gigabit ethernet and 4-8 GB of memory.  One common criticism ex-Googlers have is that it takes months to get up and be productive in the Google environment.

Data storage has always been one of the most difficult problems to address, especially as the quantity of stored data is constantly increasing. This is not simply due to the growing numbers of people regularly using the Internet, particularly with all the social networks, games and gizmos now available. Companies are also amassing more and more meticulous information relevant to their business, in order to optimize productivity and ROI (Return On Investment). I find the positioning of SQL and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) as opposites rather a shame: it’s true that the marketing wave of NoSQL has enabled the renewed promotion of a system that’s been around for quite a while, but which was only rarely considered in most cases, as after all, everything could be fitted into the « good old SQL model ». The reverse trend of wanting to make everything fit the NoSQL model is not very p</p><p>4 0.091866165 <a title="1181-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-24-Strategy%3A_Eliminate_Unnecessary_SQL.html">995 high scalability-2011-02-24-Strategy: Eliminate Unnecessary SQL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: MySQL Expert Ronald Bradford explains how one key way to improve the scalability of a MySQL server, and undoubtedly nearly every other server, is to  eliminate unnecessary SQL , saying  the most efficient way to improve an SQL statement is to eliminate it :
  

The MySQL kernel can only physically process a certain number of SQL statements for a given time period (e.g. per second). Regardless of the type of machine you have, there is a physical limit. If you eliminate SQL statements that are unwarranted and unnecessary, you automatically enable more important SQL statements to run. There are numerous other downstream affects, however this is the simple math. To run more SQL, reduce the number of SQL you need to run.

  
Ronald shows how to use  mk-query-digest  to look at query execution times and determine which ones can be profitably whacked.

<p>Introduction: The NoSQL movement faults the SQL query language as the source of  many of the scalability issues that we face today with traditional  database approach.
 
I think that the main reason so many people  have come to see SQL as the source of all evil is the fact that,  traditionally, the query language was burned into the database  implementation. So by saying NoSQL you basically say "No" to the  traditional non-scalable RDBMS implementations.
 
This view has  brought on a flood of alternative query languages, each aiming to solve a  different aspect that is missing in the traditional SQL query approach,  such as a document model, or that provides a simpler approach, such as  Key/Value query.
 
Most of the people I speak with seem fairly confused on this subject,  and tend to use query semantics and architecture interchangeably. In  Part I  of this post i tried to provide quick overview of what  each query term stands for in the context of the NoSQL world .  Part II  illustrates those ide</p><p>3 0.70038152 <a title="1181-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-13-Paper%3A_NoSQL_Databases_-_NoSQL_Introduction_and_Overview.html">1022 high scalability-2011-04-13-Paper: NoSQL Databases - NoSQL Introduction and Overview</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Christof Strauch, from Stuttgart Media University, has written an incredible 120+ page paper titled  NoSQL Databases  as an introduction and overview to NoSQL databases . The paper was written between 2010-06 and 2011-02, so it may be a bit out of date, but if you are looking to take in the NoSQL world in one big gulp, this is your chance. I asked Christof to give us a  short taste of what he was trying to accomplish in his paper:
  

The paper aims at giving a systematic and thorough introduction and overview of the NoSQL field by assembling information dispersed among blogs, wikis and scientific papers. It firstly discusses reasons, rationales and motives for the development and usage of nonrelational database systems. These can be summarized by the need for high scalability, the processing of large amounts of data, the ability to distribute data among many (often commodity) servers, consequently a distribution-aware design of DBMSs.


The paper then introduces fundamental concepts,</p><p>4 0.6777637 <a title="1181-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-09-24-Google_Spanner%27s_Most_Surprising_Revelation%3A_NoSQL_is_Out_and_NewSQL_is_In.html">1328 high scalability-2012-09-24-Google Spanner's Most Surprising Revelation: NoSQL is Out and NewSQL is In</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Google recently released a   paper on Spanner   , their planet enveloping tool for organizing the world’s monetizable information. Reading the Spanner paper I felt it had that chiseled in stone feel that all of Google’s best papers have. An instant classic. Jeff Dean foreshadowed Spanner’s humungousness as early as    2009   .  Now Spanner seems fully online, just waiting to handle “millions of machines across hundreds of datacenters and trillions of database rows.” Wow.    The Wise have yet to weigh in on Spanner en masse. I look forward to more insightful commentary. There’s a lot to make sense of. What struck me most in the paper was a deeply buried section essentially describing Google’s motivation for shifting away from NoSQL and to    NewSQL   . The money quote: 
  
   We believe it is better to have application programmers deal with performance problems due to overuse of transactions as bottlenecks arise, rather than always coding around the lack of transactions.

<p>Introduction: If Google was a boxer then MapReduce would be a probing right hand that sets up the massive left hook that is  Dremel , Google's—scalable (thousands of CPUs, petabytes of data, trillions of rows), SQL based, columnar, interactive (results returned in seconds), ad-hoc—analytics system. If Google was a magician then MapReduce would be the shiny thing that distracts the mind while the trick goes unnoticed. I say that because even though Dremel has been around internally at Google since 2006, we have not heard a whisper about it. All we've heard about is MapReduce, clones of which have inspired entire new industries.  Tricky .
 
Dremel, according to Brian Bershad, Director of Engineering at Google, is targeted at solving  BigData class problems :

<p>Introduction: MoreSQL is a cheeky idea Alex Tatiyants invented in  NoSQL No More: Let’s double down with MoreSQL  advocating that the cure for NoSQL is not less SQL, but even more SQL. Use SQL everywhere, for everything. This is of course creates yet another  NewSQL . Hopefully we've exhausted all tasteful variants of the SQL motif. 
 
While the post is ironic (I think), Google may be into MoreSQL in a big way, as described in a well written and exceptionally detailed paper:  Tenzing - A SQL Implementation On The MapReduce Framework . If you are looking for the secrets of how to get back to the good old days of joins and aggregate operators using a SQL syntax, while enjoying the scalability of NoSQL, this paper is a must read.
 
Abstract:
  

Tenzing is a query engine built on top of MapReduce for ad hoc analysis of Google data. Tenzing supports a mostly complete SQL implementation (with several extensions) combined with several key characteristics such as heterogeneity, high performance, scalabilit</p><p>2 0.70495033 <a title="1181-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-06-Instagram_Architecture%3A_14_Million_users%2C_Terabytes_of_Photos%2C_100s_of_Instances%2C_Dozens_of_Technologies.html">1152 high scalability-2011-12-06-Instagram Architecture: 14 Million users, Terabytes of Photos, 100s of Instances, Dozens of Technologies</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hibernate and iBATIS and other similar tools have documentation with recommendations for avoiding the "N+1 select" problem.  The problem being that if you wanted to retrieve a set of widgets from a table, one query would be used to to retrieve all the ids of the matching widgets (select widget_id from widget where ...) and then for each id, another select is used to retrieve the details of that widget (select * from widget where widget_id = ?).  If you have 100 widgets, it requires 101 queries to get the details of them all.     I can see why this is bad, but what if you're doing entity caching?  i.e. If you run the first query to get your list of ids, and then for each widget you retrive it from the cache.  Surely in that case, N+1(+caching) is good?  Assuming of course that there is a high probability of all of the matching entities being in the cache.     I may be asking a daft question here - one whose answer is obviously implied by the large scalable mechanisms for storing data th</p><p>4 0.67857862 <a title="1181-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-09-The_Instagram_Architecture_Facebook_Bought_for_a_Cool_Billion_Dollars.html">1224 high scalability-2012-04-09-The Instagram Architecture Facebook Bought for a Cool Billion Dollars</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's been a well kept secret, but you may have heard  Facebook will Buy Photo-Sharing Service Instagram for $1 Billion . Just what is Facebook buying? Here's a quick gloss I did a little over a year ago on a presentation Instagram gave on their architecture. In that article I called Instagram's architecture the " canonical description of an early stage startup in this era." Little did we know how true that would turn out to be.

 Instagram  is a free photo sharing and social networking service for your iPhone that has been an  instant success . Growing to  14 million users  in just over a year (now 30 million users), they reached 150 million photos in August while amassing several terabytes of photos, and they did this with just 3 Instaneers, all on the Amazon stack.

<p>Introduction: Update  :  as of the end of Q2 2011,  Akamai had 95,811  servers deployed globally.     
 
Akamai is the CDN to the stars. It claims to deliver between 15 and 30 percent of all Web traffic, with major customers like Facebook, Twitter, Apple, and the US military. Traditionally quite secretive, we get a peek behind the curtain in this paper:  The Akamai Network: A Platform for High-Performance Internet Applications  by Erik Nygren, Ramesh Sitaraman, and Jennifer Sun. 
  Abstract:
 Comprising more than 61,000 servers located across nearly 1,000 networks in 70 countries worldwide, the Akamai platform delivers hundreds of billions of Internet interactions daily, helping thousands of enterprises boost the performance and reliability of their Internet applications. In this paper, we give an overview of the components and capabilities of this large-scale distributed computing platform, and offer some insight into its architecture, design principles, operation, and management.

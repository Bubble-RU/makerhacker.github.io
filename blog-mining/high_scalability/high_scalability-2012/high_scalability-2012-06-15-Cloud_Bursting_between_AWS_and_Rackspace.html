<p>Introduction: Many organizations are facing the challenge of migrating their IT to the
cloud. But not many know how to actually approach this undertaking. In my
previous post I took a hands-on example of SpringSource's PetClinic reference
application with a Tomcat web server front-end and a Cassandra NoSQL database
backend and showed how to onboard it to the cloudin a manageable fashion. But
many think this methodology is only good for modern applications that were
built with some dynamic/cloud orientation in mind. For example, how different
would the cloud on-boarding process be if I modify my PetClinic example to use
a MySQL relational database instead of the modern Cassandra NoSQL clustered
database? In this blog post I intend to show that cloud on-boarding of
brownfield applications doesn't have to be a huge monolithic migration project
with high risk. Cloud on-boarding can take the pragmatic approach and can be
performed in a gradual process that both mitigates the risk and enables you to

runsTripAdvisor's Technical Operations team, Luke and Victor interned on his
team this past summer. This post is introduced byAndy Gelfond, TripAdvisor's
head of engineering.It's been a little over a year since our last post about
theTripAdvisor architecture. It has been an exciting year. Our business and
team continues to grow, we are now an independent public company, and we have
continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown -
we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work
across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:56M visitors per
month350M+ pages requests a day120TB+ of warehouse data running on a large
Hadoop cluster, and quickly growingWe also had a very successful college
intern program that brought on over 60 interns this past summer, all who were

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: The Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Group had a meetup Wednesday onOpenStack,
whose tag line isthe open source, open standards cloud. I was shocked at the
large turnout. 287 people registered and it looked like a large percentage of
them actually showed up. I wonder, was it the gourmet pizza, the free
t-shirts, or are people really that interested in OpenStack? And if they are
really interested, why are they that interested? On the surface an open cloud
doesn't seem all that sexy a topic, but with contributions from NASA, from
Rackspace, and from a very avid user community, a lot of interest there seems
to be. The brief intro blurb to OpenStack is:OpenStack allows any organization
to create and offer cloud computing capabilities using open source software
running on standard hardware. OpenStack Compute is software for automatically
creating and managing large groups of virtual private servers. OpenStack
Storage is software for creating redundant, scalable object storage using

<p>Introduction: Loved those mainframe days - you only needed one, but then came along the
AS400's and soon you had ten - but wait, you needed client server and SOA, oh
sh%# - now I have ten thousand servers and I need to consolidate server and
datacenter operations!Is Cloud Computing going to follow the same path?As a
technology strategist I have the benefit of frequently speaking with other
CIO's on the topic of Cloud Computing. Often those discussions are in context
to how they can leverage SpringCM' s easy, fast and affordable cloud
Enterprise Content Management (ECM) services. But those conversations are done
in context to the overall strategy and reality that the modern CIO will use a
combination of cloud offerings to solve business problems today. Some of those
services will be internally provided (Private Cloud), and many more will be

<p>Introduction: This question comes from Ulysses on aninteresting threadfrom the Mechanical
Sympathy news group, especially given how multiple processors are now the
norm:Ulysses:On an 8xCPU Linux instance,  is it at all advantageous to use the
Linux taskset command to pin an 8xJVM process set (co-ordinated as a
www.infinispan.org distributed cache/data grid) to a specific CPU affinity set
(i.e. pin JVM0 process to CPU 0, JVM1 process to CPU1, ...., JVM7process to
CPU 7) vs. just letting the Linux OS use its default mechanism for
provisioning the 8xJVM process set to the available CPUs?In effrort to seek an
optimal point (in the full event space), what are the conceptual trade-offs in
considering "searching" each permutation of provisioning an 8xJVM process set
to an 8xCPU set via taskset?Giventaskset is they key to the question, it would
help to have a definition:Used to set or retrieve the CPU affinity of a

<p>Introduction: Cloud bursting is an application deployment model in which an application runs
in a private cloud or data center and bursts into a public cloud when the
demand for computing capacity spikes. The advantage of such a hybrid cloud
deployment is that an organization only pays for extra compute resources when
they are needed. (Source: SearchCloudComputing)Neal Sample the former CTO -
X.commerce at eBay gave an interesting talk last year on the economic benefit
of Cloud Bursting. Neal pointed out eBay traffic statistics and showed some
real numbers of the business impact of bursting peak load activities using on-
demand cloud resources as presented in the diagram from his talk.In order to
use cloud bursting effectively we need to address the following set of
challenges:Workload migration- specifically the ability to clone our
application environment in a consistent way across sites in an on demand
fashion.Data Synchronization- The ability to maintain real time copy of the

<p>Introduction: In the never ending quest to figure out how to do something useful with never
ending streams of data, GraphLab: A New Framework For Parallel Machine
Learning wants to go beyond low-level programming, MapReduce, and dataflow
languages with a new parallel framework for ML (machine learning) which
exploits the sparse structure and common computational patterns of ML
algorithms. GraphLab enables ML experts to easily design and implement
efﬁcient scalable parallel algorithms by composing problem speciﬁc
computation, data-dependencies, and scheduling.  Our main contributions
include: A graph-based data model which simultaneously represents data and
computational dependencies. A set of concurrent access models which provide a
range of sequential-consistency guarantees. A sophisticated modular scheduling
mechanism. An aggregation framework to manage global state. From the
abstract:Designing and implementing efﬁcient, provably correct parallel
machine learning (ML) algorithms is challenging.

<p>Introduction: FictionPress operates both FictionPress.com and FanFiction.net and is home to
over 6 million works of fiction, with millions of writers/readers
participating from around the world in over 30 languages.Issues
addressed:Support complex and efficient indexes at 100+ million
rows.Predicable and consistent performance regardless of data size growth.Fast

offers a number of interactive features to its large user base. These include
discussion forums, in-site messaging and user reviews. FictionPress made the
decision to build its own discussion forums to meet its strict security and
performance requirements. Xing Li, CTO of FictionPress, noted that the site
"needs to host hundreds of thousands of forums. Existing forum software
doesn't do this while meeting our performance and security targets."To ensure
the real-time responsiveness of the forums, FictionPress needs the ability to

<p>Introduction: Martin Thompson wrote a really interestingarticleon the beneficial performance
impact of taking advantage of Processor Affinity:The interesting thing I've
observed is that the unpinned test will follow a step function of
unpredictable performance.  Across many runs I've seen different patterns but
all similar in this step function nature.  For the pinned tests I get
consistent throughput with no step pattern and always the greatest
throughput.The idea is by assigning a thread to a particular CPU that when a
thread is rescheduled to run on the same CPU, it can take advantage of the
"accumulated  state in the processor, including instructions and data in the
cache."  With multi-core chips the norm now, you may want to decide for
yourself how to assign work to cores and not let the OS do it for you. The
results are surprisingly strong.</p><p>6 0.91368794 <a title="1264-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-30-Dramatically_Improving_Performance_by_Debugging_Brutally_Complex_Prolems.html">1314 high scalability-2012-08-30-Dramatically Improving Performance by Debugging Brutally Complex Prolems</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ali Khajeh-Hosseini, Technical Lead at
PlanForCloud.com.  I read a recent blog post about TripAdvisor's experiment
with AWS where they attempted to process 700K HTTP requests per minute on a
replica of their live site. There was also an interesting blog post on
Pinterest's massive growth on AWS. These blogs highlighted exactly the types
of questions we're interested in, mainly:How much would it cost to deploy
System X on Cloud Y? e.g. how much would it cost to host TripAdvisor on the
AWS US-East cloud?Would it be cheaper to use deployment option X or Y? e.g.
would it be cheaper to use reserved instances, different types of instances,
different cloud providers...What happens to costs when the system grows? e.g.
Pinterest has around 410TB of data on S3, what if that keeps growing at a rate
of 25% every month, like it has been in the last 10 months?I created a couple
of deployments in PlanForCloud to explore these questions and the results are
very interesting - th</p><p>3 0.12600458 <a title="1244-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-20-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_20%2C_2012.html">1231 high scalability-2012-04-20-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 20, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve?

<p>Introduction: This article is from an interview withZuhaib Siddique, a production engineer
atHipChat, makers ofgroup chat and IM for teams.HipChat started in an unusual
space, one you might not think would have much promise, enterprise group
messaging, but as we are learning there is gold in them thereenterprise hills.
Which is why Atlassian, makers of well thought of tools like JIRA and
Confluence,acquired HipChat in 2012.And in a tale not often heard, the
resources and connections of a larger parent have actually helped HipChat
enter anexponential growth cycle. Having reached the 1.2 billion message
storage mark they are now doubling the number of messages sent, stored, and
indexed every few months.That kind of growth puts a lot of pressure on a once
adequate infrastructure. HipChat exhibited a common scaling pattern. Start
simple, experience traffic spikes, and then think what do we do now? Using
bigger computers is usually the first and best answer. And they did that. That

<p>Introduction: With Amazonannouncing new High I/O 2TB SSD instancesthe age of SSD has almost
arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on
demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on
demand rate theprice per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:27 cents
($27K/100K IOPS) per vs$1.25 for disk.With the obvious benefits of giant SSD
machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it's interesting to consider: what
architecture decisions might you make differently in the future?More Headroom
for Vertical Scaling Simplifies EverythingThe beauty of higher hardware
performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows
developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This
has always been the allure ofvertical scalingand is well realized by SSDs
through a combination of high throughput, low latencies, and just as
important, high densities.We have a few early examples showing the performance

<p>Introduction: I love it when a somewhat older article like Pinterest Cut Costs From $54 To
$20 Per Hour By Automatically Shutting Down Systems hits Hacker News and
generates agood conversation. One of the common sentiments about the cloud was
raised: why doesn't Pinterest save a lot of money by running their own
hardware instead of using the cloud?Ryan Park, Operations Engineer at
Pinterest, responds in what I think is the perfectmodern responseto that
ultimate existential design dilemma:Our #1 requirement has been to keep up
with the growth in traffic on the site. We've been growing so fast that
there's literally no way we could have ordered and racked equipment fast
enough. We were also a very small team -- a year ago there were only about a
dozen people in the whole company. At this point we're much larger, which
gives us room to consider more options like colo or multiple cloud
providers.AWS certainly feels pretty costly when you compare colo prices to
the list price for on-demand instances.

<p>Introduction: Hey, it's HighScalability time: The Herokulypse. A cautionary tale of what can
happen when scalability is left for later. Rap Genius created quite a stir
(reddit,Hacker News) when they documentedhigh costs ($20K/month for 15 million
monthly uniques) and poor performance (6 second average response times) using
Heroku'srandom routing mesh. The cause was tracked to queuing at the dyno
level when the expectation was requests are routed to free dynos. Heroku
admitsthis is a problem. So poor load balancing combined with RoR single
threading = poor performance, one that adding more dynos and spending more
money won't necessarily help. While it seems clear Heroku didn't make this
aspect of their system crystal clear, the incident has generated a lot of
teaching moments, if you slog through it all. This is a developing story.You
need money to feed the beast. Fred Wilson has somerevenue ideas for you: Paid

<p>Introduction: A user named Apathyon how Reddit scales some of their features, shares some
advice he learned while working at Google and other major companies.To be
fair, I [Apathy] was working at Google at the time, and every job I held
between 1995 and 2005 involved at least one of the largest websites on the
planet. I didn't come up with any of these ideas, just watched other smart
people I worked with who knew what they were doing and found (or wrote) tools
that did the same things. But the theme is always the same:Cache everything
you can and store the rest in some sort of database (not necessarily
relational and not necessarily centralized).Cache everything that doesn't
change rapidly. Most of the time you don't have to hit the database for
anything other than checking whether the users' new message count has
transitioned from 0 to (1 or more).Cache everything--templates, user message
status, the front page components--and hit the database once a minute or so to
update the front page, forums, e</p><p>4 0.88819414 <a title="1244-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-13-Must_see%3A_5_Steps_to_Scaling_MongoDB_%28Or_Any_DB%29_in_8_Minutes.html">1114 high scalability-2011-09-13-Must see: 5 Steps to Scaling MongoDB (Or Any DB) in 8 Minutes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jared Rosoffconcisely, effectively, entertainingly, and convincingly gives an
8 minute MongoDB tutorialon scaling MongoDB at Scale Out Camp. The ideas
aren't just limited to MongoDB, they work for most any database: Optimize your
queries; Know your working set size; Tune your file system; Choose the right
disks; Shard. Here's an explanation of all 5 strategies:Optimize your queries.
Computer science works. Complexity analysis works. A btree search is faster
than a table scan. So analyze your queries. Use explain to see what your query
is doing. If it is saying it's using a cursor then it's doing a table scan.
That's slow. Look at the number of documents it looks at to satisfy a query.
Look at how long it takes. Fix: add indexes. It doesn't matter if you are
running on 1 or 100 servers.Know your working set size. Sticking memcache in
front of your database is silly. You have lots of RAM, use it. Embed your
cache in the database, which is how MongoDB works. Working set = Active

<p>Introduction: You may have read somewhere that Facebook has introduced a newSocial Inbox
integrating email, IM, SMS,  text messages, on-site Facebook messages. All-in-
all they need to store over 135 billion messages a month. Where do they store
all that stuff? Facebook's Kannan Muthukkaruppan gives the surprise answer
inThe Underlying Technology of Messages:HBase. HBase beat out MySQL,
Cassandra, and a few others.Why a surprise? Facebook created Cassandra and it
was purpose built for an inbox type application, but they found Cassandra's
eventual consistency model wasn't a good match for their new real-time
Messages product. Facebook also has an extensiveMySQL infrastructure, but they
found performance suffered as data set and indexes grew larger. And they could
have built their own, but they chose HBase.HBase is ascaleout table store
supporting very high rates of row-level updates over massive amounts of data.
Exactly what is needed for a Messaging system. HBase is also a column based

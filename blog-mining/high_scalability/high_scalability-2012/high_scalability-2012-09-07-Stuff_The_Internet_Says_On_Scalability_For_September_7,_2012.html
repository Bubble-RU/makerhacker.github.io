<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by    Frédéric Faure    (architect at    Ysance   ), you can follow him on    twitter   . 
 
How do you scale an  AWS  (Amazon Web Services) infrastructure? This article will give you a detailed reply in two parts: the tools you can use to make the most of Amazon’s dynamic approach, and the architectural model you should adopt for a scalable infrastructure.
 
I base my report on my experience gained in several AWS production projects in casual gaming (Facebook), e-commerce infrastructures and within the mainstream GIS (Geographic Information System). It’s true that my experience in gaming ( IsCool, The Game ) is currently the most representative in terms of scalability, due to the number of users (over 800 thousand DAU – daily active users – at peak usage and over 20 million page views every day), however my experiences in e-commerce and GIS (currently underway) provide a different view of scalability, taking into account the various problems of availability and da</p><p>3 0.11440939 <a title="1318-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

 The cloud isn't for closers.  Another gaming startup pulls back from the cloud  by Derrick Harris. Digital Chocolate is following the Zynga strategy of moving games into higher performing datacenter infrastructure once it becomes popular enough in the cloud to justify the primo stuff. We talked about this strategy in  Zynga's Z Cloud - Scale Fast Or Fail Fast By Merging Private And Public Clouds . An architectural approach made all the more sensible with Amazon's new  AWS Direct Connect  service, which enables lower latency and higher bandwidth services by skipping the Internet and connecting directly to the AWS network.  AWS Direct Connect FAQs .  Amazon Virtual Private Cloud .

<p>Introduction: Hey, it's HighScalability time: 
  
 The Herokulypse. A cautionary tale of what can happen when scalability is left for later. Rap Genius created quite a stir ( reddit ,  Hacker News )  when they documented  high costs ($20K/month for 15 million monthly uniques) and poor performance (6 second average response times) using Heroku's  random routing mesh . The cause was tracked to queuing at the dyno level when the expectation was requests are routed to free dynos. Heroku admits  this is a problem . So poor load balancing combined with RoR single threading = poor performance, one that adding more dynos and spending more money won't necessarily help. While it seems clear Heroku didn't make this aspect of their system crystal clear, the incident has generated a lot of teaching moments, if you slog through it all. This is a developing story.

  The great mobile money drain . Mobile: high resource costs, low revenue. Mobile traffic on Plenty of Fish is  growing at 3% a month , rising to 3 Billion pageviews a month, 40% of signups are mobile, and all traffic will soon be 60-70% mobile. The problem: how do you make money on mobile?

We believe that there is a need for a network model, where nodes are by design below the computation and communication capabilities of Turing machines.

  @jimplush : Google spent 2.3 billion on infrastructure in Q1. Remember that when you say you want to be "the Google of something" 
 Clay Shirky: I think one of the things that happened to the P2P market for infrastructure is that users preference for predictable pricing vs resource-sensitive pricing is so overwhelming that they will overpay to anyone who can promise flat prices. And because the logic of centralization vs decentralization is so price sensitive, I don't think there is any logical reason to assume a broadly stable class of apps, separate from c</p><p>6 0.79667884 <a title="1318-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-02-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_2%2C_2012.html">1203 high scalability-2012-03-02-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 2, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the most popular and effective scalability strategies is to impose limits (  GAE Quotas  ,   Fotolog  ,   Facebook  ) as a means of protecting a website against service destroying   traffic spikes  . Twitter will reportedly   limit the number followers   to 2,000 in order to thwart follow spam. This may also allow Twitter to make some bank by   going freemium   and charging for adding more followers.     Agree or disagree with Twitter's strategies, the more interesting aspect for me is how do you introduce new policies into an already established ecosystem?      One approach is the big bang. Introduce all changes at once and let everyone adjust. If users don't like it they can move on. The hope is, however, most users won't be impacted by the changes and that those who are will understand it's all for the greater good of their beloved service. Casualties are assumed, but the damage will probably be minor.      Now in Twitter's case the people with the most followers tend to be o</p><p>3 0.90784216 <a title="1318-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-18-Paper%3A_Relational_Cloud%3A_A_Database-as-a-Service_for_the_Cloud.html">974 high scalability-2011-01-18-Paper: Relational Cloud: A Database-as-a-Service for the Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  Relational Cloud Project  is an effort by a group of researchers at MIT to  investigate technologies and challenges related to Database-as-a-Service within cloud-computing . They are trying to figure out how the advantages of the DaaS (Database-as-a-Service) model, that we've seen arise in other areas like OLAP and NoSQL, can be applied to relational databases. The DaaS advantages as they see them are: 1) predictable costs, proportional to the quality of service and actual workloads, 2) lower technical complexity, thanks to a unified and simplified service access interface, and 3) virtually infinite resources ready at hand. An interesting description of their approach is explained in the paper  Relational Cloud: A Database-as-a-Service for the Cloud . From the abstract:
  
 This paper introduces a new transactional “database-as-a-service” (DBaaS) called Relational Cloud. A DBaaS promises to move much of the operational burden of provisioning, conﬁguration, scaling, performance tun</p><p>4 0.8968876 <a title="1318-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-18-How_to_deal_with_an_I-O_bottleneck_to_disk%3F.html">251 high scalability-2008-02-18-How to deal with an I-O bottleneck to disk?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A site I'm working with has an I/O bottleneck.     They're using a static server to deliver all of the pictures/video content/zip downloads ecetera but now that the bandwith out of that server is approaching 50Mbit/second the latency on serving small files has increased to become unacceptable.     I'm curious how other people have dealt with this situation.     Seperating into two different servers would require a significant change to the sites architecutre (because the premise is that all uploads go into one server, all subdirectorie are created in one directory, etc.) and may not really solve the problem.</p><p>5 0.89536297 <a title="1318-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-29-20_New_Rules_for_Faster_Web_Pages.html">291 high scalability-2008-03-29-20 New Rules for Faster Web Pages</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:  Nice explanation in  The importance of bandwidth versus latency  of how long latencies cause cascading delays in resource loading.  Doloto  tries to optimize how resources are loaded.   Twenty new rules  have been added to the  original 14 rules  for sizzling web performance. Part of scalability is worrying about performance too. The front-end is where 80-90% of end-user response time is spent and following these best practices improved the performance of Yahoo! properties by 25-50%. The rules are divided into server, content, cookie, JavaScript, CSS, images, and mobile categories. The new rules are:
  Flush the buffer early  	[server]    Use GET for AJAX requests 	[server]    Post-load components 	[content]    Preload components 	[content]    Reduce the number of DOM elements 	[content]    Split components across domains 	[content]    Minimize the number of iframes 	[content]    No 404s 	[content]    Reduce cookie size 	[cookie]    Use cookie-free domains for components 	[coo</p><p>6 0.89319462 <a title="1318-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-16-Scaling_an_AWS_infrastructure_-_Tools_and_Patterns.html">881 high scalability-2010-08-16-Scaling an AWS infrastructure - Tools and Patterns</a></p>

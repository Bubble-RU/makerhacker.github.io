<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: Does anyone have any advice or suggestions on how to store millions of images?
Currently images are stored in a MS SQL database which performance wise isn't
ideal. We'd like to migrate the images over to a file system structure but I'd
assume we don't just want to dump millions of images into a single directory.
Besides having to contend with naming collisions, the windows filesystem might
not perform optimally with that many files.I'm assuming one approach may be to
assign each user a unique CSLID, create a folder based on the CSLID and then
place one users files in that particular folder. Even so, this could result in
hundreds of thousands of folders. Whats the best organizational
scheme/heirachy for doing this?</p><p>2 0.91764706 <a title="1252-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-01-8_Commonly_Used_Scalable_System_Design_Patterns.html">951 high scalability-2010-12-01-8 Commonly Used Scalable System Design Patterns</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ricky HoinScalable System Design Patternshas created a great list of
scalability patterns along with very well done explanatory graphics. A summary
of the patterns are:Load Balancer- a dispatcher determines which worker
instance will handle a request based on different policies.Scatter and Gather-
a dispatcher multicasts requests to all workers in a pool. Each worker will
compute a local result and send it back to the dispatcher, who will
consolidate them into a single response and then send back to the
client.Result Cache- a dispatcher will first lookup if the request has been
made before and try to find the previous result to return, in order to save
the actual execution.Shared Space- all workers monitors information from the
shared space and contributes partial knowledge back to the blackboard. The
information is continuously enriched until a solution is reached.Pipe and
Filter- all workers connected by pipes across which data flows.MapReduce-
targets batch jobs where disk I/O is th</p><p>3 0.90744215 <a title="1252-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-16-Do_you_have_any_questions_for_the_Elastra_CEO%3F.html">277 high scalability-2008-03-16-Do you have any questions for the Elastra CEO?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It looks like in the near future I'll have a chance to interview the Elastra
CEO. Elastra provides standarddatabases--MySQL, EnterpriseDB and PostgreSQL--
on top of EC2 and S3. They are selling aggressive pricing, expandable and
contactable database resource usage in response to demand, and a simple
management and operations interface to well known databases deployed in a
cloud. Elastra could be an important option for developers looking for a more
traditional cloudy database.I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions
for questions you would like answered? What would you like to know about their
service? What are you looking for in a cloudy database? What would stop you
from adopting it or what would make you decide to adopt it? Any ideas you have
would help a lot and will probably be better than anything I have.</p><p>4 0.90422451 <a title="1252-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-21-Using_Google_AppEngine_for_a_Little_Micro-Scalability.html">307 high scalability-2008-04-21-Using Google AppEngine for a Little Micro-Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Over the years I've accumulated quite a rag tag collection of personal systems
scattered wide across a galaxy of different servers. For the past month I've
been on a quest to rationalize this conglomeration by moving everything to a
managed service of one kind or another. The goal: lift a load of worry from my
mind. I like to do my own stuff my self so I learn something and have control.
Control always comes with headaches and it was time for a little aspirin. As
part of the process GAE came in handy as a host for a few Twitter related
scripts I couldn't manage to run anywhere else. I recoded my simple little
scripts into Python/GAE and learned a lot in the process.breakIn the move I
exported HighScalability from a VPS and imported it into a shared hosting
service. I could never quite configure Apache and MySQL well enough that they
wouldn't spike memory periodically and crash the VPS. And since a memory crash
did not automatically restarted it was unacceptable. I also wrote a script t</p><p>same-blog 5 0.89942694 <a title="1252-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-25-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_25%2C_2012.html">1252 high scalability-2012-05-25-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 25, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post bySiddharth Anand, a senior member of LinkedIn's
Distributed Data Systems team. Preamble RambleIf you've been working in the
online (e.g. internet) space over the past 3 years, you are no stranger to
terms like "the cloud" and "NoSQL".In 2007, Amazon published a paper onDynamo.
The paper detailed how Dynamo, employing a collection of techniques to solve
several problems in fault-tolerance, provided a resilient solution to the on-
line shopping cart problem. A few years go by while engineers at AWS toil in
relative obscurity at standing up their public cloud.It's December 2008 and I
am a member of Netflix's Software Infrastructure team. We've just been told
that there is something called the "CAP theorem" and because of it, we are to
abandon our datacenter in hopes of leveraging Cloud Computing.Huh?A month into
the investigation, we start wondering about our Oracle database. How are we
are going to move it into the cloud? That's when we are told that we are to

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post written byVictor Trac, Cloud Architect
atBazaarvoice.Bazaarvoice is a company that people interact with on a regular
basis but have probably never heard of. If you read customer reviews on sites
like bestbuy.com, nike.com, or walmart.com, you are using Bazaarvoice
services. These sites, along with thousands of others, rely on Bazaarvoice to
supply the software and technology to collect and display user conversations
about products and services. All of this means that Bazaarvoice processes a
lot of sentiment data on most of the products we all use daily.Bazaarvoice
helps our clients make better products by using a combination of machine
learning and natural language processing to extract useful information and
user sentiments from the millions of free-text reviews that go through our
platform. This data gets boiled down into reports that clients can use to
improve their products and services. We are also starting to look at how to
show personalized sortings of revie</p><p>4 0.11024888 <a title="1211-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve?

website out of the comfort of their own datacenter and into the wilds of the
Amazon cloud. This paper by Netflix's Siddharth "Sid" Anand,Netflix's

transition and does a deep dive on SimpleDB best practices, focussing
especially on techniques useful to those who are making the move from a

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>4 0.75790757 <a title="1211-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-14-DynamoDB_Talk_Notes_and_the_SSD_Hot_S3_Cold_Pattern.html">1245 high scalability-2012-05-14-DynamoDB Talk Notes and the SSD Hot S3 Cold Pattern</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My impression of DynamoDB before attending aAmazon DynamoDB for Developerstalk
is that it's the usual quality service produced by Amazon: simple, fast,
scalable, geographically redundant, expensive enough to make you think twice
about using it, and delightfully NoOp.After the talk my impression has become
more nuanced. The quality impression still stands. Look at theforumsand you'll
see the typical issues every product has, but no real surprises. And as a
SimpleDB++, DynamoDB seems to have avoided second system syndrome and produced
a more elegant design.What was surprising is how un-cloudy DynamoDB appears to
be. The cloud pillars of pay for what you use and quick elastic response to
bursty traffic have been abandoned, for some understandable reasons, but the
result is you really have to consider your use cases before making DynamoDB
the default choice.Here are some of my impressions from the talk...DynamoDB is
a clean well lighted place for key-value data. The interface is simple,

<p>Introduction: We have written agents deployed/distributed across the network. Agents sends
data every 15 Secs may be even 5 secs. Working on a service/system to which
all agent can post data/tuples with marginal payload. Upto 5% drop rate is
acceptable. Ultimately the data will be segregated and stored into DBMS System
(currently we are using MSQL).Question(s) I am looking for answer1.
Client/Server Communication: Agent(s) can post data. Status of sending data is
not that important. But there is a remote where Agent(s) to be notified if the
server side system generates an event based on the data sent.- Lot of advices
from internet suggests using Message Bus (ActiveMQ) for async communication.
Multicast and UDP are the alternatives.2. Persistence: After some evaluation
data to be stored in DBMS System.- End of processing data is an aggregated
record for which MySql looks scalable. But on the volume of data is
exponential. Considering HBase as an option.Looking if there are any
alternatives for above</p><p>6 0.73880559 <a title="1211-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-24-The_State_of_NoSQL_in_2012.html">1180 high scalability-2012-01-24-The State of NoSQL in 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The term "cloud portability" is often considered a synonym for
"CloudAPIportability," which implies a series of misconceptions.If we break
away from dogma, we can find that what we really looking for in cloud
portability is Application portability between clouds which can be a vastly
simpler requirement, as we can achieve application portability without
settling on a common CloudAPI.In this post i'll be covering five common
misconceptions people haveWRTto cloud portability.Cloud portability = Cloud
API portability. API portability is easy; cloud API portability is not.The
main incentive for Cloud Portability is - Avoiding Vendor lock-in.Cloud
portability is more about business agility than it is about vendor lock-
in.Cloud portability isn't for startups. Every startup that is expecting rapid
growth should re-examine their deployments and plan for cloud portability
rather than wait to be forced to make the switch when you are least prepared
to do so.Cloud portability = Compromising on t</p><p>3 0.85818619 <a title="1211-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-04-Map-Reduce_With_Ruby_Using_Hadoop.html">968 high scalability-2011-01-04-Map-Reduce With Ruby Using Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A demonstration, with repeatable steps, of how to quickly fire-up a Hadoop
cluster on Amazon EC2, load data onto the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File-
System), write map-reduce scripts in Ruby and use them to run a map-reduce job
on your Hadoop cluster. You willnotneed to ssh into the cluster, as all tasks
are run from your local machine. Below I am using my MacBook Pro as my local
machine, but the steps I have provided should be reproducible on other
platforms running bash and Java.Fire-Up Your Hadoop ClusterI choose
theCloudera distribution of Hadoopwhich is still 100% Apache licensed, but has
some additional benefits. One of these benefits is that it is released byDoug
Cutting, who started Hadoop and drove itâ€™s development at Yahoo! He also
startedLucene, which is another of my favourite Apache Projects, so I have
good faith that he knows what he is doing. Another benefit, as you will see,
is that it is simple to fire-up a Hadoop cluster.I am going to use

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post bySiddharth Anand, a senior member of LinkedIn's
Distributed Data Systems team.Over the past 3 years, I've had the good fortune
to work with many emerging NoSQL products in the context of supporting the
needs of a high-traffic, customer facing web site.In 2010, I helped Netflix to
successfullytransition its web scale use-cases from Oracle to SimpleDB, AWS'
hosted database service. On completion of that migration, we started a second
migration, this time from SimpleDB to Cassandra. The first transition was key
to our move from our own data center to AWS' cloud. The second was key to our
expansion from one AWS Region to multiple geographically-distributed Regions
-- today Netflix serves traffic out of two AWS Regions, one in Virginia, the
other in Ireland (F1). Both of these transitions have been successful, but
have involved integration pain points such as the creation of database
replication technology.In December 2011, I moved to LinkedIn's Distributed

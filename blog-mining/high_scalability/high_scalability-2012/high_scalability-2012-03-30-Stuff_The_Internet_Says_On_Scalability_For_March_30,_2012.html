<p>Introduction: Update:Jake inDoes Django really scale better than Rails?thinks apps like FFS
shouldn't need so much hardware to scale.In a short three months Friends for
Sale (think Hot-or-Not with a market economy) grew to become a top 10 Facebook
application handling 200 gorgeous requests per second and a stunning 300
million page views a month. They did all this using Ruby on Rails, two part
time developers, a cluster of a dozen machines, and a fairly standard
architecture. How did Friends for Sale scale to sell all those beautiful
people? And how much do you think your friends are worth on the open market?

<p>Introduction: Georeplication is one of the standard techniques for dealing when bad things--
failure and latency--happen to good systems. The problem is always: how do you
do that? Murat Demirbas, Associate Professor at SUNY Buffalo, has a couple of
really good posts that can help:MDCC: Multi-Data Center Consistency andMaking
Geo-Replicated Systems Fast as Possible, Consistent when Necessary. In MDCC:
Multi-Data Center Consistency Murat discusses a paper that says synchronous
wide-area replication can be feasible. There's a quick and clear explanation
of Paxos and various optimizations that is worth the price of admission. We
find that strong consistency doesn't have to be lost across a WAN:The good
thing about using Paxos over the WAN is you /almost/ get the full CAP  (all
three properties: consistency, availability, and partition-freedom). As we
discussed earlier (Paxos taught), Paxos is CP, that is, in the presence of a
partition, Paxos keeps consistency over availability. But, Paxos can still

<p>Introduction: Chris Dixonunearthed agreat quotefrom Douglas Adams on the nature of
technological adoption that unsurprisingly hits the mark in our ever changing
and evolving world:Anything that is in the world when you're born is normal
and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.Anything
that's invented between when you're fifteen and thirty-five is new and
exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.Anything
invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of thingsSome
that come to mind: horse to car, index card to online search, PC to mobile,
web to app, portal to messaging, Newton to Einstein, oil to electric, rock to
rap, Aquinas to Bacon, buying to renting, files to streaming, network TV to
cordkilling, broadcast to social, programming CPUs to programming biology,

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.We tend to think compute
of resources as residing primarily in datacenters. Given the fast pace of
innovation we will likely see compute resources become pervasive. Some will
reside in datacenters, but compute resources can be anywhere, not just in the
datacenter, we'll actually see the bulk of compute resources live outside of
datacenters in the future.Given the diversity of compute resources it's
reasonable to assume they won't be homogeneous or conform to a standard API.
They will specialize by service. Programmers will have to use those
specialized service interfaces to build applications that are adaptive enough
to take advantage of whatever leverage they can find, whenever and wherever
they can find it. Once found the application will have to reorganize on the
fly to use whatever new resources it has found and let go of whatever
resources it doesn't have</p><p>4 0.79727817 <a title="1219-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-04-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_October_4th%2C_2013.html">1527 high scalability-2013-10-04-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For October 4th, 2013</a></p>

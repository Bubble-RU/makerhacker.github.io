<p>Introduction: My impression of DynamoDB before attending aAmazon DynamoDB for Developerstalk
is that it's the usual quality service produced by Amazon: simple, fast,
scalable, geographically redundant, expensive enough to make you think twice
about using it, and delightfully NoOp.After the talk my impression has become
more nuanced. The quality impression still stands. Look at theforumsand you'll
see the typical issues every product has, but no real surprises. And as a
SimpleDB++, DynamoDB seems to have avoided second system syndrome and produced
a more elegant design.What was surprising is how un-cloudy DynamoDB appears to
be. The cloud pillars of pay for what you use and quick elastic response to
bursty traffic have been abandoned, for some understandable reasons, but the
result is you really have to consider your use cases before making DynamoDB
the default choice.Here are some of my impressions from the talk...DynamoDB is
a clean well lighted place for key-value data. The interface is simple,

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

Scaling to the next level at WhatsAppreveals some eye
poppingWhatsAppstats:What has hundreds of nodes, thousands of cores, hundreds
of terabytes of RAM, and hopes to serve the billions of smartphones that will
soon be a reality around the globe? The Erlang/FreeBSD-based server
infrastructure at WhatsApp. We've faced many challenges in meeting the ever-
growing demand for our messaging services, but as we continue to push the
envelope on size (>8000 cores) and speed (>70M Erlang messages per second) of
our serving system.But since we don't have that talk yet, let's take a look at
a talk Rick Reed gave two years ago on WhatsApp:Scaling to Millions of
Simultaneous Connections.Having built a high performance messaging bus in C++
while at Yahoo, Rick Reed is not new to the world of high scalability
architectures. The founders are also ex-Yahoo guys with not a little
experience scaling systems.

<p>Introduction: It's being reportedYahoo bought Tumblr for $1.1 billion. You may
recallInstagram was profiled on HighScalabilityand they were also bought by
Facebook for a ton of money. A coincidence? You be the judge.Just what is
Yahoo buying? The business acumen of the deal is not something I can judge,
but if you are doing due diligence on the technology then Tumblr would
probably get a big thumbs up. To see why, please keep on reading...With over
15 billion page views a month Tumblr has become an insanely popular blogging
platform. Users may like Tumblr for its simplicity, its beauty, its strong
focus on user experience, or its friendly and engaged community, but like it
they do.Growing at over 30% a month has not been without challenges. Some
reliability problems among them. It helps to realize that Tumblr operates at
surprisingly huge scales: 500 million page views a day, a peak rate of ~40k
requests per second, ~3TB of new data to store a day, all running on 1000+
servers.One of the common patt</p><p>6 0.1109772 <a title="1311-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-03-5_Steps_to_Benchmarking_Managed_NoSQL_-_DynamoDB_vs_Cassandra.html">1434 high scalability-2013-04-03-5 Steps to Benchmarking Managed NoSQL - DynamoDB vs Cassandra</a></p>

Quotes:@jimplush: Google spent 2.3 billion on infrastructure in Q1. Remember
that when you say you want to be "the Google of something"Clay Shirky: I think
one of the things that happened to the P2P market for infrastructure is that
users preference for predictable pricing vs resource-sensitive pricing is so
overwhelming that they will overpay to anyone who can promise flat prices. And
because the logic of centralization vs decentralization is so price sensitive,
I don't think there is any logical reason to assume a broadly stable class of

<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting
system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by
advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide
guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see
how!Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed
in a format calledAlexandrian form which draws on constructs used by
Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:The pattern
nameThe problem the pattern is trying to solveContextSolutionExamplesDesign
rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why
experts use itPatterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context,
and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new
context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next
‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied. A pattern language is a structured

<p>Introduction: In many posts, such as: The Future of the Parallelism and its Challenges I
mentioned that synchronization the access to the shared resource is the major
challenge to write parallel code.The synchronization and coordination take
long time from the overall execution time, which reduce the benefits of the
parallelism; the synchronization and coordination also reduce the
scalability.There are many forms of synchronization and coordination, such
as:Create Task object in frameworks such as: Microsoft TPL, Intel TDD, and
Parallel Runtime Library. Create and enqueue task objects require
synchronization that it's takes long time especially if we create it into
recursive work such as: Quick Sort algorithm.Synchronization the access to
shared data.But there are a few techniques to avoid these issues, such as:
Shared-Nothing, Actor Model, and Hyper Object (A.K.A. Combinable Object).
Simply if we reduce the shared data by re-architect our code this will gives
us a huge benefits in performance and s</p><p>5 0.90869367 <a title="1311-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-17-WebSphere_Commerce_High_Availability_and_Performance_Configurations.html">321 high scalability-2008-05-17-WebSphere Commerce High Availability and Performance Configurations</a></p>

all know about usopen.org so here's the story:breakWhile the re-emergence of
35-year-old Andre Agassi and the continued dominance of wunderkind Maria
Sharapova have highlighted the on-court headlines at this year's U.S. Open
Tennis Championships in Flushing Meadows, N.Y., IBM is hoping its new Power5
chip-based IT support for USOpen.org can make news among those more interested
in .NET than tennis nets.Big Blue has partnered with the U.S. Tennis
Association and the U.S. Open -- the most prestigious tennis tournament in the
U.S. -- since 1992. Together, they launched USOpen.org in 1995 so racket heads
could follow the matches online.The iSeries' role this year is in powering a

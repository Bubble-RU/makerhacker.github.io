What if you still need more performance after doing all of this tuning? One option is to use SSDs. Shutterfly uses  Facebook’s flashcache : kernel module to cache data on SSD. Designed for MySQL/InnoDB. SSD in front of a disk, but exposed as a single mount point. This only makes sense when you have lots of physical I/O. Shutterfly saw a speedup of 500% w/ flashcache. A benefit is that you can delay sharding: less complexity.

<p>Introduction: Guest post by  Asya Kamsky , Principal Solutions Architect at MongoDB. 
 
This post outlines ten things you need to know for operating MongoDB at scale based on my experience working with MongoDB customers and open source users:
  
  MongoDB requires DevOps, too.  MongoDB is a database. Like any other data store, it requires capacity planning, tuning, monitoring, and maintenance. Just because it's easy to install and get started and it fits the developer paradigm more naturally than a relational database, don't assume that MongoDB doesn't need proper care and feeding.  And just because it performs super-fast on a small sample dataset in development doesn't mean you can get away without having a good schema and indexing strategy, as well as the right hardware resources in production! But if you prepare well and understand the best practices, operating large MongoDB clusters can be boring instead of nerve-wracking. 
  Successful MongoDB users monitor everything and prepare for growth.</p><p>4 0.10689625 <a title="1169-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-15-Wordnik_-_10_million_API_Requests_a_Day_on_MongoDB_and_Scala.html">990 high scalability-2011-02-15-Wordnik - 10 million API Requests a Day on MongoDB and Scala</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wordnik  is an online dictionary and language resource that has both a website and an API component. Their goal is to  show you as much information as possible, as fast as we can find it, for every word in English, and to give you a place where you can make your own opinions about words known.  As cool as that is, what is really cool is the information they share in their  blog  about their experiences building a web service. They've written an excellent series of articles and presentations you may find useful:   
 
  What has technology do  Save & Close ne for words lately?    
 
  Eventual consistency . Using an eventually consistent model they can do work in parallel and  we count as many words as possible when we can, and add them all up when there’s a lag. The count’s always in the ballpark, and we never have to stop .D 
  Document-oriented storage .

The ideas aren't just limited to MongoDB, they work for most any database: Optimize your queries; Know your working set size; Tune your file system; Choose the right disks; Shard. Here's an explanation of all 5 strategies:
  
  Optimize your queries . Computer science works. Complexity analysis works. A btree search is faster than a table scan. So analyze your queries. Use explain to see what your query is doing. If it is saying it's using a cursor then it's doing a table scan. That's slow. Look at the number of documents it looks at to satisfy a query. Look at how long it takes. Fix: add indexes. It doesn't matter if you are running on 1 or 100 servers. 
  Know your working set size . Sticking memcache in front of your database is silly. You have lots of RAM, use it. Embed your cache in the database, which is how MongoDB works.

Learn How to Read-write Scale Without a Complete Re-write</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lately I've been reading more cases were different people have started to realize the limitations of the NoSQL promise to database scalability. Note the references below:
     
  Why does Quora use MySQL as the data store instead of NoSQLs such as Cassandra, MongoDB, CouchDB etc?  
  Why did Diaspora abandon MongoDB for MySQL?  
  How scalable is CouchDB in practice, not just in theory?  
   

Take MongoDB for example. It's damn fast, but it doesn't really know how to save data reliably to disk. I've had it set up in a replica pair to mitigate that risk. Guess what - both servers in the pair failed and corrupted their data files at the same day.

  
It appears that for many, the switch to NoSQL can be rather painful. IMO that doesn't necessarily mean that NoSQL is wrong in general, but it's a combination of 1) lack of maturity 2) not the right tool for the job.
 
That brings the question of what's the alternative solution?

 Update 6:   NoSQL : If Only it Was that Easy . BJ Clark lays down the law on which databases are scalable: Tokyo - NO, Redis - NO, Voldemort - YES, MongoDB - Not Yet, Cassandra - Probably, Amazon S3 - YES * 2, MySQL - NO.  The real thing to point out is that if you are being held back from making something super awesome because you can’t choose a database, you are doing it wrong.   Update 5:   Exciting stuff happening in Japan at this Key-Value Storage meeting in Tokyo . Presentations on Groonga, Senna, Lux IO, Tokyo-Cabinet, Tx, repcached, Kai, Cagra, kumofs, ROMA, and Flare.
 
 Update 4:   NoSQL and the Relational Model: don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater  by Matthew Willson.  So my key point is, this kind of modelling is WORTH DOING, regardless of which database tool you end up using for physical storage.   Update 3:   Choosing a non-relational database</p><p>6 0.62803471 <a title="1169-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-12-Stuff_the_Internet_Says_on_Scalability_For_November_12th%2C_2010.html">940 high scalability-2010-11-12-Stuff the Internet Says on Scalability For November 12th, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Yahoo has developed a new language called Pig Latin that fit in a sweet spot between high-level declarative querying in the spirit of SQL, and low-level, procedural programming `a la map-reduce and combines best of both worlds.  The accompanying system, Pig, is fully implemented, and compiles Pig Latin into physical plans that are executed over Hadoop, an open-source, map-reduce implementation. Pig has just graduated from the Apache Incubator and joined Hadoop as a subproject.  The paper has a few examples of how engineers at Yahoo! are using Pig to dramatically reduce the time required for the development and execution of their data analysis tasks, compared to using Hadoop directly.

<p>Introduction: Why migrate your database? Efficiency and availability problems are harming your business – reports are out of date, your batch processing window is nearing its limits, outages (unplanned/planned) frequently halt work. Database consolidation – remove the costs that result from a heterogeneous database environment (DBAs time, database vendor pricing, database versions, hardware, OSs, patches, upgrades etc.). OK, so the driving forces for migration are clear,  what now?﻿

<p>Introduction: If you are a startup you may find useful Guy Kawasaki's post   Financial Models for Underachievers: Two Years of the Real Numbers of a Startup  . Part of any business plan are the projected guestimates. They are guestimates because everyone keeps these numbers hidden like a Swiss bank account.  But not   Redfin  . They've bravely shared their initial cost projections, their actual numbers from real life, and the lessons they've learned from the discrepancy between the two...           You can find their model estimates and actuals for Rent, Per Employee, Per Month (model: $250, actual: $336); Initial Per-Employee Equipment Cost; Monthly Benefits, Per-Employee; Annual Payroll Tax; Quarterly Bonus Payout, as a % of the Total Possible; Annual Payroll Increase for Existing Employees; All-Company Meeting Cost, Per-Meeting, Per-Employee; Annual Accounting Costs, and a few more.      There is also a great lessons section: Focus on headcount; Plan slow, run fast; Run top-down sanity-checks; Fo</p><p>5 0.9830898 <a title="1169-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-23-Big_Data_on_Grids_or_on_Clouds%3F_.html">743 high scalability-2009-11-23-Big Data on Grids or on Clouds? </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Contributed by Wolfgang Gentzsch:
 
Now that we have a new computing paradigm, Cloud Computing, how can Clouds help our data? Replace our internal data vaults as we hoped Grids would? Are Grids dead now that we have Clouds? Despite all the promising developments in the Grid and Cloud computing space, and the avalanche of publications and talks on this subject, many people still seem to be confused about internal data and compute resources, versus Grids versus Clouds, and they are hesitant to take the next step. I think there are a number of issues driving this uncertainty.

</p><p>5 While the same  root causes of delay – network congestion, routing changes, time out  intervals – have an impact on TCP, it generally only  delays  the  communication and other than an uncomfortable wait for the user, does  not negatively impact the content itself. [sent-8, score-0.612]
</p><p>6 However,  this does not mean that there are no negative impacts (other than trying  the patience of users) from the performance issues that may plague web  applications and particularly those that are more and more often out  there, in the nebulous “cloud”. [sent-10, score-0.438]
</p><p>7 Delays are effectively business jitter  and have a real impact on the ability of the business to perform its  critical functions – and that includes generating revenue. [sent-11, score-0.975]
</p><p>8 BUSINESS JITTER and the CLOUD     David  Linthicum summed up the issue with performance of cloud-based  applications well and actually used the terminology “jitter” to describe  the unpredictable pattern of delay:            Are  cloud services slow? [sent-12, score-0.409]
</p><p>9 In fact, they appear to have the pattern of a very  jittery process. [sent-16, score-0.134]
</p><p>10 Clearly, the program or system is struggling to obtain  virtual resources that, in turn, struggle to obtain physical resources. [sent-17, score-0.204]
</p><p>11 -- David Linthicum, “ Face the facts: Cloud performance isn't always stable ”     But  what the multitude of articles coming out over the past year or so with  respect to performance of cloud services has largely ignored is the  very real and often measurable impact on business processes. [sent-19, score-0.721]
</p><p>12 That jitter  that occurs at the protocol and application layers trickles up to  become jitter in the business process; a process that may be critical to  servicing customers (and thus impacts satisfaction and brand) as well  as on the bottom line. [sent-20, score-1.623]
</p><p>13 Business jitter can also manifest as decreased business productivity measures, which it  turns out can be measured mathematically if you put your mind to it . [sent-22, score-0.815]
</p><p>14 Understanding the variability of cloud performance is important for two reasons:     You  need to understand the impact on the business and quantify it before  embarking on any cloud initiative so it can be factored in to the  overall cost-benefit analysis. [sent-23, score-0.912]
</p><p>15 It may be that the cost savings from  public cloud are much greater than the potential loss of revenue and/or  productivity, and thus the benefits of a cloud-based solution outweigh  the risks. [sent-24, score-0.357]
</p><p>16 Understanding the variability and from where it  comes will have an impact and help guide you to choosing not only the  right provider, but the right solutions that may be able to normalize or  mitigate the variability. [sent-25, score-0.473]
</p><p>17 If the primary source of business jitter is  your WAN, for example, then it may be that choosing a provider that  supports your ability to deploy WAN optimization solutions would be an  appropriate strategy. [sent-26, score-0.988]
</p><p>18 Similarly   , if the variability in performance stems from capacity issues, then choosing a provider that allows greater latitude in  load balancing  algorithms or the deployment of a virtual (soft) ADC would likely be the best strategy. [sent-27, score-0.459]
</p><p>19 It  seems clear from testing and empirical (as well as anecdotal) evidence  that cloud performance is highly variable and, as David puts it,  unstable. [sent-28, score-0.194]

<p>Introduction: The adding   jitter    strategy was one of the most commented on techniques from    7 Years Of YouTube Scalability Lessons In 30 Minutes    on    HackerNews   . Probably because it’s one of the emergent phenomena that you really can’t predict and is shocking when you see it in real life. Here’s the technique: 
   Add Entropy Back into Your System    
  If your system doesn’t jitter then you get    thundering herds   . Distributed applications are really weather systems. Debugging them is as deterministic as predicting the weather. Jitter introduces more randomness because surprisingly, things tend to stack up.  
  For example, cache expirations. For a popular video they cache things as best they can. The most popular video they might cache for 24 hours. If everything expires at one time then every machine will calculate the expiration at the same time. This creates a thundering herd.  
  By jittering you are saying  randomly expire between 18-30 hours. That prevents things from stackin</p><p>3 0.15622133 <a title="1184-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-30-Hot_New_Trend%3A_Linking_Clouds_Through_Cheap_IP_VPNs_Instead_of_Private_Lines_.html">645 high scalability-2009-06-30-Hot New Trend: Linking Clouds Through Cheap IP VPNs Instead of Private Lines </a></p>
<p>Introduction: You might think major Internet companies have a latency, availability, and bandwidth advantage because they can afford expensive dedicated point-to-point private line networks between their data centers. And you would be right. It's a great advantage. Or it at least it was a great advantage. Cost is the great equalizer and companies are now scrambling for ways to cut costs. Many of the most recognizable Internet companies are moving to IP VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) as a much cheaper alternative to private lines. This is a strategy you can effectively use too.  This trend has historical precedent in the data center. In the same way leading edge companies moved early to virtualize their data centers, leading edge companies are now virtualizing their networks using IP VPNs to build inexpensive private networks over a shared public network. In kindergarten we learned sharing was polite, it turns out sharing can also save a lot of money in both the data center and on the network.

<p>Introduction: Loved those mainframe days – you only needed one, but then came along the AS400’s and soon you had ten – but wait, you needed client server and SOA, oh sh%# – now I have ten thousand servers and I need to consolidate server and datacenter operations!
 
 Is Cloud Computing going to follow the same path? 
 
As a technology strategist I have the benefit of frequently speaking with other CIO’s on the topic of Cloud Computing. Often those discussions are in context to how they can leverage SpringCM’ s easy, fast and affordable cloud Enterprise Content Management (ECM) services. But those conversations are done in context to the overall strategy and reality that the modern CIO will use a combination of cloud offerings to solve business problems today. Some of those services will be internally provided (Private Cloud), and many more will be outside the traditional corporate domain, also known as Public Cloud services.
 
 What options do I have?

<p>Introduction: Today, most banks have migrated their internal software development from C/C++ to the Java language because of well-known advantages in development productivity (Java Platform), robustness & reliability (Garbage Collector) and platform independence (Java Bytecode). They may even have gotten better throughput performance through the use of standard architectures and application servers (Java Enterprise Edition). Among the few banking applications that have not been able to benefit yet from the Java revolution, you find the latency-critical applications connected to the trading floor. Why? Because of the unpredictable pauses introduced by the garbage collector which result in significant jitter (variance of execution time).

<p>Introduction: Cloud-based services for all things digital will either drive – or die by – bandwidth
 
   Consumers, by definition, consume. In the realm of the Internet, they consume far more than they produce. Or so it’s been in the past. Broadband connectivity across all providers have long offered asymmetric network feeds because it mirrored reality: an HTTP request is significantly smaller than its corresponding response, and in general web-based activity is heavily biased toward fat download and thin upload speeds. The term “broadband” is really a misnomer, as it focuses only on the download speed and ignores the very narrowband of a typical consumer’s upload speed.
 
 cloud computing  , or to be more accurate, cloud-hosted services aimed at consumers may very well change the status quo by necessity. As providers continue to push the notion of storing all things digital “in the cloud”, network providers must consider the impact on them – and the satisfaction of their customer base with performa</p><p>4 0.73878992 <a title="1184-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-21-The_Conspecific_Hybrid_Cloud.html">1212 high scalability-2012-03-21-The Conspecific Hybrid Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When you’re looking to add new tank mates to an existing aquarium  ecosystem, one of the concerns you must have is whether a particular  breed of fish is amenable to conspecific cohabitants. Many species are  not, which means if you put them together in a confined space, they’re  going to fight. Viciously. To the death. Responsible aquarists try to  avoid such situations, so careful attention to the  conspecificity  of animals is a must.
 
Now,  while in many respects the data center ecosystem correlates well to an  aquarium ecosystem, in this case it does not. It’s what you usually get,  today, but its not actually the best model. That’s because what you  want in the data center ecosystem – particularly when it extends to  include public  cloud computing   resources – is conspecificity in infrastructure.
 
This  desire and practice is being seen both in enterprise data center  decision making as well as in startups suddenly dealing with massive  growth and increasingly encountering pe</p><p>5 0.71300679 <a title="1184-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-14-Private-Public_Cloud.html">444 high scalability-2008-11-14-Private-Public Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Data centers are reshaping themselves by taking ideas from public cloud providers, such as Amazon and Google. The idea is to make the data center more cost-effective by enabling on-demand utility-based computing rather than dedicated machines. At the same time, it is clear that to make IT operations more effective, it doesn't make sense to run all the applications that are currently hosted in a company's data center in the private cloud. This calls for an integration between private and public cloud. In this post i discuss some of the challenges involved in making that happen:    1. How do we design applications to be cloud-agnostic?    2. How do we enable seamless fail-over to a public cloud?    3. Future-proofing: There are many cases in which we can't make a clear decision as to where our application should be running at the time of writing or developing the application. We would like to be in a position to change the decision as to where our application will be running even after o</p><p>6 0.70043617 <a title="1184-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-01-Why_is_your_network_so_slow%3F_Your_switch_should_tell_you..html">1051 high scalability-2011-06-01-Why is your network so slow?

<p>Introduction: If you've wondered why I haven't been posting lately it's because I've been on an amazing  Beach's motorcycle tour  of the  Alps  ( and ,  and ,  and ,  and ,  and ,  and ,  and ,  and ). My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.   The trip was more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system, listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of fellow riders. Magical.  They say you'll ride more</p><p>2 0.98333675 <a title="1184-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-28-NoSQL_Took_Away_the_Relational_Model_and_Gave_Nothing_Back.html">930 high scalability-2010-10-28-NoSQL Took Away the Relational Model and Gave Nothing Back</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update : Benjamin Black said he was the source of the quote and also said I was wrong about what he meant. His real point:  The meaning of the statement was that NoSQL systems (really the various map-reduce systems) are lacking a standard model for describing and querying and that developing one should be a high priority task for them. 
 
At the  A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto , an audience member, sorry, I couldn't tell who, said something I found really interesting:  NoSQL took away the relational model and gave nothing back.  
 
  The idea being that   NoSQL has focussed on ease of use, scalability, performance, etc, but it has lost the idea of how data relates to other data. True to its name, the relational model is very good at capturing a managing relationships. With NoSQL all relationships have been pushed back onto the poor programmer to implement in code rather than the database managing it. We've sacrificed usability. NoSQL is about concurrency, latency, and scalability, but it</p><p>3 0.9818328 <a title="1184-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-10-Saying_Yes_to_NoSQL%3B_Going_Steady_with_Cassandra_at_Digg.html">793 high scalability-2010-03-10-Saying Yes to NoSQL; Going Steady with Cassandra at Digg</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The last six months have been exciting for Digg's engineering team. We're working on a soup-to-nuts rewrite. Not only are we rewriting all our application code, but we're also rolling out a new client and server architecture. And if that doesn't sound like a big enough challenge, we're replacing most of our infrastructure components and moving away from LAMP.
 
Perhaps our most significant infrastructure change is abandoning MySQL in favor of a NoSQL alternative. To someone like me who's been building systems almost exclusively on relational databases for almost 20 years, this feels like a bold move.
  What's Wrong with MySQL?  
Our primary motivation for moving away from MySQL is the increasing difficulty of building a high performance, write intensive, application on a data set that is growing quickly, with no end in sight. This growth has forced us into horizontal and vertical partitioning strategies that have eliminated most of the value of a relational database, while still incurr</p><p>4 0.98054218 <a title="1184-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-16-Just-In-Time_Scalability%3A_Agile_Methods_to_Support_Massive_Growth_%28IMVU_case_study%29.html">493 high scalability-2009-01-16-Just-In-Time Scalability: Agile Methods to Support Massive Growth (IMVU case study)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Before      We started with a small site, a mess of open source, and a small team that didn't know much about scaling.          After      We ended with a large site, a medium sized team, and an architecture that has scaled.         We never stopped. We used a roadmap and a compass, made weekly changes in direction, regularly shipped code on Wednesday to handle the next weekend's capacity constraints, and shipped new features the whole time.           These are excerpts from the IMVU PDF presentation of their architecture which can be viewed or downloaded  here    .         IMVU    is an online destination where adults and teens meet new people in 3D. IMVU won the 2008 Virtual Worlds Innovation Award and was also named a Rising Star in the 2008 Silicon Valley Technology Fast 50 program.</p><p>5 0.97918791 <a title="1184-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-24-INFOSCALE_2009_in_June_in_Hong_Kong.html">580 high scalability-2009-04-24-INFOSCALE 2009 in June in Hong Kong</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In case you are interested here's the info:     INFOSCALE 2009: The 4th International ICST Conference on Scalable Information Systems. 10-12 June 2009, Hong Kong, China.     In the last few years, we have seen the proliferation of the use of heterogeneous distributed systems, ranging from simple Networks of Workstations, to highly complex grid computing environments. Such computational paradigms have been preferred due to their reduced costs and inherent scalability, which pose many challenges to scalable systems and applications in terms of information access, storage and retrieval.     Grid computing, P2P technology, data and knowledge bases, distributed information retrieval technology and networking technology should all converge to address the scalability concern. Furthermore, with the advent of emerging computing architectures - e.g. SMTs, GPUs, Multicores. - the importance of designing techniques explicitly targeting these systems is becoming more and more important.

<p>Introduction: Hi,      Can someone teach me how you implement network switch fail over since we are paranoid for single point of failure.     For example, you have:     a dozen web servers -> switch -> DB cluster     that switch is a SPOF.  How does one implement dual switch in a fail over fashion?</p><p>4 0.098190747 <a title="1367-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-22-SLAs_in_the_SaaS_space.html">475 high scalability-2008-12-22-SLAs in the SaaS space</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This may be a bit higher level then the general discussion here, but I think this is an important issue in how it relates to reliability and uptime. What kind of SLAs should we be expecting from SaaS services and platforms (e.g. AWS, Google App Engine, Google Premium Apps, salesforce.com, etc.)? Up to today, most SaaS services either have no SLAs or offer very weak penalties. What will it take to get these services up to the point where they can offer the SLAs that users (and more importantly, businesses) require? I presume most of the members here want to see more movement into the cloud and to SaaS services, and I'm thinking that until we see more substantial SLA guarantees, most businesses will continue to shy away as long as they can.     Would love to hear what others think. Or am I totally off base?</p><p>5 0.096019551 <a title="1367-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-08-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_8%2C_2013.html">1420 high scalability-2013-03-08-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 8, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A lot of sites hosted in San Francisco are down because of at least 6 back-to-back power outages power outages. More details at  laughingsquid .
   
Sites like SecondLife, Craigstlist, Technorati, Yelp and all Six Apart properties, TypePad, LiveJournal and Vox are all down. The cause was an underground explosion in a transformer vault under a manhole at 560 Mission Street. Flames shot 6 feet out from the manhole cover. Over PG&E; 30,000 customers are without power.  What's perplexing is the UPS backup and diesel generators didn't kick in to bring the datacenter back on line. I've never toured that datacenter, but they usually have massive backup systems. It's probably one of those multiple simultaneous failure situations that you hope never happen in real life, but too often do. Or maybe the infrastructure wasn't rolled out completely.  Update: the cause was a cascade of failures in a tightly couples system that could never happen :-) Details at  Failure Happens: A summary of the power</p><p>3 0.73904574 <a title="1367-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-20-Netflix%3A_Harden_Systems_Using_a_Barrel_of_Problem_Causing_Monkeys_-_Latency%2C_Conformity%2C_Doctor%2C_Janitor%2C_Security%2C_Internationalization%2C_Chaos.html">1083 high scalability-2011-07-20-Netflix: Harden Systems Using a Barrel of Problem Causing Monkeys - Latency, Conformity, Doctor, Janitor, Security, Internationalization, Chaos</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With a new Planet of the Apes coming out, this may be a touchy subject with our new overlords, but Netflix is using a whole lot more trouble injecting monkeys to test and iteratively harden their systems. We learned previously how Netflix used  Chaos Monkey , a tool to test failover handling by continuously failing EC2 nodes. That was just a start. More monkeys have been added to the barrel. Node failure is just one problem in a system. Imagine a problem and you can imagine creating a monkey to test if your system is handling that problem properly. Yury Izrailevsky talks about just this approach in this very interesting post:  The Netflix Simian Army .
 
I know what you are thinking, if monkeys are so great then why has Netflix been down lately.  Dmuino addressed  this potential embarrassment, putting all fears of cloud inferiority to rest:
  

Unfortunately we're not running 100% on the cloud today. We're working on it, and we could use more help. The latest outage was caused by a com</p><p>4 0.70851135 <a title="1367-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-28-Elasticity_for_the_Enterprise_--_Ensuring_Continuous_High_Availability_in_a_Disaster_Failure_Scenario.html">816 high scalability-2010-04-28-Elasticity for the Enterprise -- Ensuring Continuous High Availability in a Disaster Failure Scenario</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many enterprises' high-availability architecture is based on the assumption that you can prevent failure from happening by putting all your critical data in a centralized database, back it up with expensive storage, and replicate it somehow between the sites. As I argued in one of my previous posts ( Why Existing Databases (RAC) are So Breakable! ) many of those assumptions are broken at their core, as storage is doomed to failure just like any other device, expensive hardware doesn’t make things any better and database replication is often not enough.
 
One of the main lessons that we can take from the likes of Amazon and Google is that the right way to ensure continuous high availability is by designing our system to cope with failure. We need to assume that what we tend to think of as unthinkable will probably happen, as that’s the nature of failure. So rather than trying to prevent failures, we need to build a system that will tolerate them.
 
As we can learn from a  recent outage</p><p>5 0.69779873 <a title="1367-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-29-Second_Hand_Seizure_%3A_A_New_Cause_of_Site_Death.html">1070 high scalability-2011-06-29-Second Hand Seizure : A New Cause of Site Death</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Like a digital SWAT team that implodes the wrong door on a raid, the FBI  seized multiple racks of computers  from DigitalOne, these  racks  host websites from many clients that just happened to be in the same racks as whomever they are investigating. Downed sites include Instapaper, Curbed Network, and  Pinboard . With the  density of servers  these days many 1000s of sites could easily have been effected.
 
Sites like Pinboard were victims by association, they did not inhale. This is an association sites have no control over. On a shared hosting service, you have no control over your fellow VM mates. In a cloud or a managed service, you have no control over which racks your servers are in. So like second hand smoke, you get the disease by random association. There's something inherently unfair about that.

<p>Introduction: I found the discussion of the available bandwidth of tree vs higher dimensional virtual networks topologies quite, to quote Spock,  fascinating :   A mathematical analysis by Ritter (2002) (one of the original developers of Napster) presented a detailed numerical argument demonstrating that the Gnutella network could not scale to the capacity of its competitor,  the Napster network. Essentially, that model showed that the Gnutella network is severely bandwidth-limited long before the P2P population reaches a million peers.  In each of these previous studies, the conclusions have overlooked the intrinsic bandwidth limits of the underlying topology in the Gnutella network: a Cayley tree (Rains and Sloane 1999) (see Sect. 9.4 for the definition).  Trees are known to have lower aggregate bandwidth than higher dimensional topologies, e.g., hypercubes and hypertori. Studies of interconnection topologies in the literature have tended to focus on hardware implementations (see, e.g., Culler et</p><p>same-blog 5 0.82374692 <a title="1367-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-05-5_Ways_to_Make_Cloud_Failure_Not_an_Option.html">1367 high scalability-2012-12-05-5 Ways to Make Cloud Failure Not an Option</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With cloud SLAs generally being worth what you don't pay for them, what can you do to protect yourself? Sean Hull in  AirBNB didn’t have to fail   has some solid advice on how to deal with outages:
  
  Use Redundancy . Make database and webserver tiers redundant using multi-az or alternately read-replicas.  
  Have a browsing only mode . Give users a read-only version of your site. Users may not even notice failures as they will only see problems when they need to perform a write operation. 
  Web Applications need Feature Flags . Build in the ability to turn off and on major parts of your site and flip the switch when problems arise. 
  Consider Netflix’s Simian . By randomly causing outages in your application you can continually test your failover and redundancy infrastructure. 
  Use multiple clouds . Use Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Clouds as a way of surviving outages in any one particular cloud. 
  
None of these are easy and it's worth considering that your application may</p><p>6 0.77910256 <a title="1367-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-29-Paper%3A_Spamalytics%3A_An_Empirical_Analysisof_Spam_Marketing_Conversion.html">478 high scalability-2008-12-29-Paper: Spamalytics: An Empirical Analysisof Spam Marketing Conversion</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is the third guest post (part 1,part 2) of a series by Greg Lindahl, CTO
of blekko, the spam free search engine. Previously, Greg was Founder and
Distinguished Engineer at PathScale, at which he was the architect of the
InfiniPath low-latency InfiniBand HCA, used to build tightly-coupled
supercomputing clusters.blekko's home-grown NoSQL database was designed from
the start to support a web-scale search engine, with 1,000s of servers and
petabytes of disk. Data replication is a very important part of keeping the
database up and serving queries. Like many NoSQL database authors, we decided
to keep R=3 copies of each piece of data in the database, and not use RAID to
improve reliability. The key goal we were shooting for was a database which
degrades gracefully when there are many small failures over time, without
needing human intervention.Why don't we like RAID for big NoSQL databases?Most
big storage systems use RAID levels like 3, 4, 5, or 10 to improve
reliability. A conservativ</p><p>3 0.17905477 <a title="1186-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-04-Wide_Fast_SATA%3A_the_Recipe_for_Hot_Performance.html">1511 high scalability-2013-09-04-Wide Fast SATA: the Recipe for Hot Performance</a></p>

flash memory are staggering.If you're not using SSD, you are doing it wrong.
Not quite true, but close. Some small applications fit entirely in memory -
less than 100GB - great for in-memory solutions. There's a place for
rotational drives (HDD) in massive streaming analytics and petabytes of data.
But for the vast space between, flash has become the only sensible option. For
example, the Samsung 840 costs $180 for 250GB. The speed rating for this drive
is rated by the manufacturer at 96,000 random 4K read IOPS, and 61,000 random
4K write IOPS. The Samsung 840 is not alone at this price performance. A 300GB
Intel 320 is $450. An OCZ Vertex 4 256GB is $235, with the Intel being rated
as slowest, but our internal testing showing solid performance. Most

<p>Introduction: Jared Rosoffconcisely, effectively, entertainingly, and convincingly gives an
8 minute MongoDB tutorialon scaling MongoDB at Scale Out Camp. The ideas
aren't just limited to MongoDB, they work for most any database: Optimize your
queries; Know your working set size; Tune your file system; Choose the right
disks; Shard. Here's an explanation of all 5 strategies:Optimize your queries.
Computer science works. Complexity analysis works. A btree search is faster
than a table scan. So analyze your queries. Use explain to see what your query
is doing. If it is saying it's using a cursor then it's doing a table scan.
That's slow. Look at the number of documents it looks at to satisfy a query.
Look at how long it takes. Fix: add indexes. It doesn't matter if you are
running on 1 or 100 servers.Know your working set size. Sticking memcache in
front of your database is silly. You have lots of RAM, use it. Embed your
cache in the database, which is how MongoDB works. Working set = Active

<p>Introduction: Stanford Info Lab is taking pains to document a direction we've been moving
for a while now, using RAM not just as a cache, but as the primary storage
medium. Manyquality products have built on this model. Even if the vision
isn't radical, the paper does produce a lot of data backing up the transition,
which is in itself helpful. From the The Abstract:Disk-oriented approaches to
online storage are becoming increasingly problematic: they do not scale grace-
fully to meet the needs of large-scale Web applications, and improvements in
disk capacity have far out-stripped improvements in access latency and
bandwidth. This paper argues for a new approach to datacenter storage called
RAMCloud, where information is kept entirely in DRAM and large-scale systems
are created by aggregating the main memories of thousands of commodity
servers. We believe that RAMClouds can provide durable and available storage
with 100-1000x the throughput of disk-based systems and 100-1000x lower access
latency. T</p><p>5 0.80648863 <a title="1186-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-05-Paper%3A_A_Study_of_Practical_Deduplication.html">1035 high scalability-2011-05-05-Paper: A Study of Practical Deduplication</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With BigData comes BigStorage costs. One way to store less is simplynot to
store the same data twice. That's the radically simple and powerful notion
behind data deduplication. If you are one of those who got a good laugh out of
the idea of eliminating SQL queries as a rather obvious scalability strategy,
you'll love this one, but it is a powerful feature and one I don't hear talked
about outside the enterprise. A parallel idea in programming is the once-and-
only-once principle of never duplicating code.Using deduplication technology,
for some upfront CPU usage, which is a plentiful resource in many systems that
are IO bound anyway, it's possible to reduce storage requirements by upto
20:1, depending on your data, which saves both money and disk write overhead.
This comes up because of really good article Robin Harris of StorageMojo
wrote, All de-dup works, on a paper,  A Study of Practical Deduplication by

<p>Introduction: "Data is everywhere, never be at a single location. Not scalable, not
maintainable."-Alex SzalayWhile Galileo played life and death doctrinal games
over the mysteries revealed by the telescope, another revolution went
unnoticed, the microscope gave up mystery after mystery and nobody yet
understood how subversive would be what it revealed. For the first time these
new tools of perceptual augmentation allowed humans to peek behind the veil of
appearance. A new new eye driving human invention and discovery for hundreds
of years.Data is anothermaterialthat hides, revealing itself only when we look
at different scales and investigate its underlying patterns. If the universe
is trulymade of information, then we are looking into truly primal stuff. A
new eye is needed for Data and an ambitious project calledData-scopeaims to be
the lens.A detailedpaperon the Data-Scope tells more about what it is:The

<p>Introduction: Twitter Sees Its 20 Billionth Tweet writes  Marshall Kirkpatrick of
ReadWriteWeb.Startups die for not having customers, so STOP thinking about how
to scale. Alessandro Orsi saysfocusing on the architecture and scaling
possibilities of your app for millions of users is just plain
dumb...concentrate on marketing...concentrate on user experience. Alessandro
is perfectly correct, but this isn't the year the 2000 when the default
architecture that is easy is also not scalable and when sites were built from
scratch one painful user at a time.  Today neither is tue. In the era of
social networks, where Facebook has 500 million users, successful applications
can and often do spike to millions of users seemingly overnight. And you have
to have some architecture. With today's tool-chains you don't have to choose
easy and non-scalable. There are other options. Of course, it's all pointless
without customers and that is what you need to worry about, but it's a false
choice in this era to think tha</p><p>3 0.9092195 <a title="1186-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-14-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_14th%2C_2014.html">1612 high scalability-2014-03-14-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 14th, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 35:How and Why Glue is Using Amazon SimpleDB instead of a Relational
Database. Discusses a key design decision that required duplicating data in
order to mimic RDBMS joins:Given the trade off between potential
inconsistencies and scalability, social services have to choose the
latter.Update 34: Apparently Amazon pulled this article. I'm not sure what
that means. Maybe time went backwards or something?Amazon dramatically drops
SimpleDB pricing to $0.25 per GB per month from $1.50 per GB. This puts
SimpleDB on par withGoogle App Engine. They also announced a few new
features:a SQL-like SELECT API as well as a Batch Put operation to streamline
uploading of multiple items or attributes. One of the complaints against
SimpleDB is that programmers end up writing too much code to do simple things.
These features and a much cheaper price should help considerably. And you can
store lots of data now. GAE is still capped.Update 33: Amazon announcesElastic

<p>Introduction: Update::Eucalyptus Goes Commercial with $5.5M Funding Round. This removes my
objection that it's an academic project only. Go team go!Rich Wolski,
professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara,
gave a spirited talk onEucalyptusto a large group of very interested
cloudsters at theEucalyptus Cloud Meetup. If Rich could teach computer science
at every school the state of the computer science industry would be
stratospheric. Rich is dynamic, smart, passionate, and visionary. It's that
vision that prompted him to create Eucalyptus in the first place. Rich and his
group are experts in grid and distributed computing, having a long and
glorious history in that space. When he saw cloud computing on the rise he
decided the best way to explore it was to implement what everyone accepted as
a real cloud, Amazon's API. In a remarkably short time they implement
Eucalyptus and have been improving it and tracking Amazon's changes ever
since.The question I had going into t</p><p>6 0.89916408 <a title="1186-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-06-Building_a_Unique_Data_Warehouse.html">716 high scalability-2009-10-06-Building a Unique Data Warehouse</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 2: YouTube Reaches One Billion Views Per Day.That's at least 11,574
views per second, 694,444 views per minute, and 41,666,667 views per
hour.Update:YouTube: The Platform. YouTube adds a new rich set of APIs in
order to become your video platform leader--all for free. Upload, edit, watch,
search, and comment on video from your own site without visiting YouTube.
Compose your site internally from APIs because you'll need to expose them
later anyway.YouTube grew incredibly fast, to over 100 million video views per
day, with only a handful of people responsible for scaling the site. How did
they manage to deliver all that video to all those users? And how have they
evolved since being acquired by Google?Information SourcesGoogle

Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming, which talks
in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai
use to serve video over on an inherently video unfriendly medium like the
Internet. For Akamai they found:Each video is encoded in five versions at
different bit rates and stored in separate files.The client sends commands to
the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control
algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds. Akamai uses only the video
level to adapt the video source to the available bandwidth, whereas the frame
rate of the video is kept constant.When a sudden drop in the available
bandwidth occurs, short interruptions of the video playback can occur due to

<p>Introduction: The future is live. The future is real-time. The future is now. That's the
hype anyway. And as it has a habit of doing, the hype is slowly becoming
reality. We are seeing live searches, live tweets, live location, live reality
augmentation, live crab (fresh and local), and live event publishing. One of
the most challenging of all live technologies is that of live video
broadcasting. Imagine a world in which everyone becomes a broadcaster and a
consumer of video streams, all in real-time (< 250 msec latency), all so you
can talk and interact directly without feeling like you are in the middle of a
time shift war. The resources and the engineering needed to make this happened
must be substantial. How do you do that?To find out I talked to Kyle Vogt,
Justin.tv Founder and VP of Engineering. Justin.tv certainly has the numbers.
Their 30 million unique monthly visitors even outshine YouTube in the video
upload game, reportedly uploading nearly 30 hours per minute of video compared
to YouTub</p><p>5 0.23470676 <a title="1201-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-15-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Justin.Tv%27s_Live_Video_Broadcasting_Architecture.html">1359 high scalability-2012-11-15-Gone Fishin': Justin.Tv's Live Video Broadcasting Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: All,I'm just new to this and have a basic understanding how CDN works? My
questions are:1. How does CDN sync data with web servers for video/images? If
I have a user to upload a video to my site, will it get stored directly in CDN
or it comes to my webserver first and then sync-ed with cache server?2. How to
have only the dynamic video/image delivered through CDN while the rest is
served by a webserver?3. How sync happens and who pays for the bandwidth for
sync?I'd appreciate if someone could explain this.Regards,Janakan Rajendran</p><p>4 0.74921769 <a title="1201-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-19-High_Definition_Video_Delivery_on_the_Web%3F.html">447 high scalability-2008-11-19-High Definition Video Delivery on the Web?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How would you architect and implement an SD and HD internet video delivery
system such as the BBC iPlayer orRecast Digital's RDV1. What do you need to
consider on top of the Lessons Learned section in theYouTube

Google? Can you just use a CDN and scale efficiently? Would Amazon's cloud

<p>Introduction: Hi,I am building a video-sharing site and I'm looking for an efficient way to
update video views count.The easiest way would be to perform an SQL update to
increase the "views" counter every time a video is viewed, but naturally I
want to avoid DB write access as much as possible.I am looking for an
efficient temporary storage to which I could connect and say "increment views
of video X". Every so often I would save the changes to my main database, and
remove the counter from this temporary storage.I am having a hard time finding
such temporary storage, however. My first thought was memcache, but it's not
ideal as I wouldn't like to lose the data if memcache goes down. Also,
memcache's increment command requires that the key is already present - that
means that every time a video is viewed, I would have to check if the key
already exists in memcache, before I can actually send the increment
command.What do people use to solve this kind of issues?Kind regards,Tomasz</p><p>6 0.74327487 <a title="1201-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-21-What_CDN_would_you_recommend%3F.html">576 high scalability-2009-04-21-What CDN would you recommend?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Limelight says 95% of Mobile Video Views Take Place in First 90 Days and 88.8
percent of views take place in the first 30 days.Since a lot of people are
working with video, which is expensive to store and serve, the implication:
there's little need to keep your video close to the user or on a CDN after 30
days.</p><p>2 0.92799842 <a title="1201-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine_Snippet_Search_New_Indexing_Technology.html">746 high scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine Snippet Search New Indexing Technology</a></p>

take you in small trip in Snippet Search research project at Kngine. What is
Kngine?Kngine is startup company working in Searching technologies, We in
Kngine aims to organize the human beingsSystematic KnowledgeandExperiencesand
make it accessible to everyone. We aim to collect and organize all objective
data, and make it possible and easy to access. Our goal is to buildWeb 3.0 Web
Search Engineon the advances of Web Search Engine, Semantic Web, Data
Representation technologies a new form of Web Search Engine that will unleash
a revolution of new possibilities. Introduction to Snippet SearchToday, The
Web Search Engine's is the Web getaway, especially to get specific
information. But unfortunately the search engines didn't changed mush as the
Web changed from 90's.Since the 90's the Web search engine still provide the
same kind of results: Links to documents. We in Kngine think that it's the
time to rethink abo</p><p>3 0.92533624 <a title="1201-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-26-Performance_-_When_do_I_start_worrying%3F.html">549 high scalability-2009-03-26-Performance - When do I start worrying?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A common problem of the application designers is to predict when they need to
start worrying about the Architectural/System improvements on their
application. Do I need to add more resources? If yes, then how long before I
am compelled to do so? The question is not only when but also what. Should I
plan to implement a true caching layer on top of my application or do I need
to shard my database. Do I need to move to a distributed search infrastructure
and if yes when ! Essentially we try to find out the functionalities of the
application that will become critical over time.</p><p>4 0.92230487 <a title="1201-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-13-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Facing_scaling_issues_with_news_feeds_on_Redis.__Any_advice%3F.html">1303 high scalability-2012-08-13-Ask HighScalability: Facing scaling issues with news feeds on Redis.  Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are
already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.We're basically using
a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and
topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on
Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store
to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget).
Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text,
author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.I'm wondering if
we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store
the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback
here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to
retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just
post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to get the r</p><p>5 0.91302979 <a title="1201-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-28-DR-BC_for_web-DB_servers.html">226 high scalability-2008-01-28-DR-BC for web-DB servers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: All,I'm looking for a faster/reliable solution for DR/BC as well as for
sclability for my web/db servers. I came across VMWare Infrastructure and
other products. The I/O performance concerns me to go with virtual servers.
I'm also looking into imaging software such as Acrnois.Could anyone share
their thoughts on how it's being done with bigger names such as google/youtube
etc..?Thank you,Regards,Janakan Rajendran.</p><p>6 0.90707552 <a title="1201-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-19-UK_Based_CDN.html">324 high scalability-2008-05-19-UK Based CDN</a></p>

</p><p>9 What's a smart way of handling the materialization problem? [sent-11, score-0.145]
</p><p>10 , who found:The best policy is to decide whether to push or pull events on a per producer/consumer basis. [sent-13, score-0.112]
</p><p>11 This technique minimizes system cost both for workloads with a high query rate and those with a high event rate. [sent-14, score-0.413]
</p><p>12 I learned about this paper from Tumblr's Blake Matheny, in an interview with him for a forthcoming post. [sent-16, score-0.154]
</p><p>13 This is broadly how they handle the inbox problem at Tumblr. [sent-17, score-0.477]
</p><p>14 Abstract from the paper:Near real-time event streams are becoming a key feature of many popular web applications. [sent-19, score-0.461]
</p><p>15 Many web sites allow users to create a personalized feed by selecting one or more event streams they wish to follow. [sent-20, score-0.873]
</p><p>16 Examples include Twitter and Facebook, which allow a user to follow other users' activity, and iGoogle and My Yahoo, which allow users to follow selected RSS streams. [sent-21, score-0.425]
</p><p>17 Constructing such a feed must be fast so the page loads quickly, yet reflects recent updates to the underlying event streams. [sent-23, score-0.523]
</p><p>18 The wide fanout of popular streams (those with many followers) and high skew (fanout and update rates vary widely) make it difficult to scale such applications. [sent-24, score-0.4]
</p><p>19 We associate feeds with consumers and event streams with producers. [sent-25, score-0.683]
</p><p>20 We demonstrate that the best performance results from selectively materializing each consumer's feed: events from high-rate producers are retrieved at query time, while events from lower-rate producers are materialized in advance. [sent-26, score-1.155]

which we built on the side. We had absolutely no idea it would grow into one
of the largest online fashion communities. The entire first version took about
two weeks to develop and our feed implementation was dead simple. We've come a
long way since then and I'd like to share our experience with scaling feed
systems.Feeds are a core component of many large startups such as Pinterest,
Instagram, Wanelo and Fashiolista. At Fashiolista the feed system powers
theflat feed,aggregated feedand thenotification system. This article will
explain the troubles we ran into when scaling our feeds and the design

of how these feed systems work is essential as more and more applications rely

chasm crossing from startup to wildly successful startup. Finding people,
evolving infrastructures, servicing old infrastructures, while handling huge
month over month increases in traffic, all with only four engineers, means you
have to make difficult choices about what to work on. This was Tumblr's
situation. Now with twenty engineers there's enough energy to work on issues

<p>Introduction: Toy solutions solving Twitter's "problems" are a favorite scalability trope.
Everybody has this idea that Twitter is easy. With a little architectural hand
waving we have a scalable Twitter, just that simple. Well, it's not that
simple asRaffi Krikorian, VP of Engineering at Twitter, describes in his
superb and very detailed presentation onTimelines at Scale. If you want to
know how Twitter works - then start here.It happened gradually so you may have
missed it, but Twitter has grown up. It started as a strugglingthree-tierish
Ruby on Railswebsite to become a beautifully service driven core that we
actually go to now to see if other services are down. Quite a change.Twitter
now has 150M world wide active users, handles 300K QPS to generate timelines,
and a firehose that churns out 22 MB/sec. 400 million tweets a day flow
through the system and it can take up to 5 minutes for a tweet to flow from
Lady Gaga's fingers to her 31 million followers.A couple of points stood
out:Twitter no lon</p><p>6 0.69270104 <a title="1175-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-28-Design_Decisions_for_Scaling_Your_High_Traffic_Feeds.html">1538 high scalability-2013-10-28-Design Decisions for Scaling Your High Traffic Feeds</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Today, most banks have migrated their internal software development from C/C++
to the Java language because of well-known advantages in development
productivity (Java Platform), robustness & reliability (Garbage Collector) and
platform independence (Java Bytecode). They may even have gotten better
throughput performance through the use of standard architectures and
application servers (Java Enterprise Edition). Among the few banking
applications that have not been able to benefit yet from the Java revolution,
you find the latency-critical applications connected to the trading floor.
Why? Because of the unpredictable pauses introduced by the garbage collector
which result in significant jitter (variance of execution time).In this post
Frederic Pariente Engineering Manager at Sun Microsystems posted a summary of
a case study on how the use of Sun Real Time JVM and GigaSpaces was used in
the context of of a customer proof-of-concept this summer to ensureguaranteed

<p>Introduction: How do you scale an inbox that has multiple highly volatile feeds? That's a
problem faced by social networks like Tumblr, Facebook, and Twitter. Follow a
few hundred event sources and it's hard to scalably order an inbox so that you
see a correct view as event sources continually publish new events.This can be
considered like aview materializationproblem in a database. In a database a
view is a virtual table defined by a query that can be accessed like a table.
Materialization refers to when the data behind the view is created. If a view
is a join on several tables and that join is performed when the view is
accessed, then performance will be slow. If the view is precomputed access to
the view will be fast, but more resources are used, especially considering
that the view may never be accessed.Your wall/inbox/stream is a view on all
the people/things you follow. If you never look at your inbox then
materializing the view in your inbox is a waste of resources, yet you'll be
mad if displ</p><p>5 0.89934546 <a title="1175-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-29-10_Things_Bitly_Should_Have_Monitored.html">1587 high scalability-2014-01-29-10 Things Bitly Should Have Monitored</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Monitor, monitor, monitor. That's the advice every startup gives once they
reach a certain size. But can you ever monitor enough? If you are Bitly and
everyone will complain when you are down, probably not.Here are 10 Things We
Forgot to Monitor from Bitly, along with good stories and copious amounts of
code snippets. Well worth reading, especially after you've already started
monitoring the lower hanging fruit.An interesting revelation from the article
is that:We run bitly split across two data centers, one is a managed
environment with DELL hardware, and the second is Amazon EC2.  Fork Rate. A
strange configuration issue caused processes to be created at a rate of
several hundred a second rather than the expected 1-10/second. Flow control
packets.  A network configuration that honors flow control packets and isn't
configured to disable them, can temporarily cause dropped traffic.Swap In/Out

<p>Introduction: Toy solutions solving Twitter's "problems" are a favorite scalability trope.
Everybody has this idea that Twitter is easy. With a little architectural hand
waving we have a scalable Twitter, just that simple. Well, it's not that
simple asRaffi Krikorian, VP of Engineering at Twitter, describes in his
superb and very detailed presentation onTimelines at Scale. If you want to
know how Twitter works - then start here.It happened gradually so you may have
missed it, but Twitter has grown up. It started as a strugglingthree-tierish
Ruby on Railswebsite to become a beautifully service driven core that we
actually go to now to see if other services are down. Quite a change.Twitter
now has 150M world wide active users, handles 300K QPS to generate timelines,
and a firehose that churns out 22 MB/sec. 400 million tweets a day flow
through the system and it can take up to 5 minutes for a tweet to flow from
Lady Gaga's fingers to her 31 million followers.A couple of points stood

<p>Introduction: Twitter has a big hairy audacious goal of reaching one billion users by 2013.
Three forces stand against Twitter. The world will end in2012. But let's be
optimistic and assume we'll make it. Next is Facebook. Currently Facebook is
the user leader with over 400 million users. Will Facebook stumble or will
they rocket to one billion users before Twitter? And lastly, there's Twitter's
"low" starting point and "slow" growth rate. Twitter currently has106
millionregistered users and adds about 300,000 new users a day. That doesn't
add up to a billion in three years. Twitter needs to triple the number of
registered users they add per day. How will Twitter reach its goal of over one
billion users served?From recent infrastructure announcements and information
gleaned atChirp (videos) and other talks, it has become a little clearer how
they hope to reach their billion user goal: 1) Make a Big Hairy Audacious Goal

<p>Introduction: Jeremy Cole, a DBA Team Lead/Database Architect at Twitter, gave a really good
talk at the O'Reilly MySQL conference:Big and Small Data at @Twitter, where
the topic was thinking of Twitter from the data perspective.One of the
interesting stories he told was of the transition from Twitter's old way of
storing tweets using temporalsharding, to a more distributed approach using a
new tweet store called T-bird, which is built on top ofGizzard, which is built
using MySQL.Twitter's original tweet store:Temporally sharded tweets was a
good-idea-at-the-time architecture. Temporal sharding simply means tweets from
the same date range are stored together on the same shard.The problem is
tweets filled up one machine, then a second, and then a third. You end up
filling up one machine after another.This is a pretty common approach and one
that has some real flaws:Load balancing. Most of the old machines didn't get
any traffic because people are interested in what is happening now, especially
with T</p><p>5 0.16853659 <a title="1251-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-11-So%2C_Why_is_Twitter_Really_Not_Using_Cassandra_to_Store_Tweets%3F.html">855 high scalability-2010-07-11-So, Why is Twitter Really Not Using Cassandra to Store Tweets?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A firestorm of accusations circled around recently saying that Cassandra, the
elected-by-major-adopters emperor of the NoSQL movement, has no clothes. It
was said Twitter was dumping Cassandra; Reddit outages were linked to
Cassandra; and even Facebook, Cassandra's cradle of birth, was said to have
abandoned Cassandra. Shouts of NoSQL Fail! were heard in the streets. Much
gloating followed. Is the emperor really naked? Casually dressed maybe, but
not naked.(Note: after this point the article contains a flow chart that is
NSFW. Some people are very sensitive about cussing, so if that's you, please
go back, don't read on. Danger! There are no nude pictures or anything, just
some strong language. But this is my most favorite flow chart of all time, so
it's worth it :-)Is Twitter really abandoning Cassandra? Not according to
Twitter, which came out with a post,Cassandra at Twitter Today, explaining
that they are using Cassandra in production for geolocation and analytics.

<p>Introduction: If Twitter is the "nervous system of the web" as some people think, then what
is the brain that makes sense of all those signals (tweets) from the nervous
system? That brain is the Twitter Analytics System and Kevin Weil, as
Analytics Lead at Twitter, is the homunculus within in charge of figuring out
what those over 100 billion tweets (approximately the number of neurons in the
human brain) mean.Twitter has only 10% of the expected 100 billion tweets now,
but a good brain always plans ahead. Kevin gave a talk,Hadoop and Protocol
Buffers at Twitter, at theHadoop Meetup, explaining how Twitter plans to use
all that data to an answer key business questions.What type of questions is
Twitter interested in answering? Questions that help them better understand
Twitter. Questions like:How many requests do we serve in a day?What is the
average latency?How many searches happen in day?How many unique queries, how
many unique users, what is their geographic distribution?What can we tell

<p>Introduction: Jim Starkey, founder ofNuoDB, in thisthread on the Cloud Computing group,
delivers a masterful post on why he thinks the relational model is the best
overall compromise amongst the different options, why NewSQL can free itself
from the limitations of legacy SQL architectures, and how this creates a brave
new lock free world....I'll[Jim Starkey]go into more detail later in the post
for those who care, but the executive summary goes like this:  Network latency
is relatively high and human attention span is relatively low.  So human
facing computer systems have to perform their work in a small number of trips
between the client and the database server.  But the human condition leads
inexorably to data complexity.  There are really only two strategies to manage
this problem. One is to use coarse granularity storage, glombing together
related data into a single blob and letting intelligence on the client make
sense of it.  The other is storing fine granularity data on the server and
using i</p><p>same-blog 2 0.96016306 <a title="1251-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-24-Build_your_own_twitter_like_real_time_analytics_-_a_step_by_step_guide.html">1251 high scalability-2012-05-24-Build your own twitter like real time analytics - a step by step guide</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Major social networking platforms like Facebook and Twitter have developed
their own architectures for handling the need for real-time analytics on huge
amounts of data. However, not every company has the need or resources to build
their own Twitter-like solution.In this example we have taken the same Twitter
/Facebook-like blueprint, and made it simple enough for developers to
implement. We have taken the following approach in our implementation: Use In
Memory Data Grid (XAP) for handling the real time stream data-
processing.BigData data-base (Cassandra) for storing the historical data and
manage the trend analytics Use Cloudify (cloudifysource.org)  for managing and
automating the deployment on private or public cloudThe example demonstrate a
simple case of word count analytics. It uses Spring Social to plug-in to real
twitter feeds. The solution is designed to efficiently cope with getting and
processing the large volume of tweets. First, we partition the tweets so that
we can proc</p><p>3 0.95262861 <a title="1251-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-10-Switch_your_databases_to_Flash_storage._Now._Or_you%27re_doing_it_wrong..html">1369 high scalability-2012-12-10-Switch your databases to Flash storage.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byBrian Bulkowski, CTO and co-founder ofAerospike, a
leading clustered NoSQL database, has worked in the area of high performance
commodity systems since 1989.Why flash rules for databasesThe economics of
flash memory are staggering.If you're not using SSD, you are doing it wrong.
Not quite true, but close. Some small applications fit entirely in memory -
less than 100GB - great for in-memory solutions. There's a place for
rotational drives (HDD) in massive streaming analytics and petabytes of data.
But for the vast space between, flash has become the only sensible option. For
example, the Samsung 840 costs $180 for 250GB. The speed rating for this drive
is rated by the manufacturer at 96,000 random 4K read IOPS, and 61,000 random
4K write IOPS. The Samsung 840 is not alone at this price performance. A 300GB
Intel 320 is $450. An OCZ Vertex 4 256GB is $235, with the Intel being rated
as slowest, but our internal testing showing solid performance. Most

<p>Introduction: With Amazonannouncing new High I/O 2TB SSD instancesthe age of SSD has almost
arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on
demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on
demand rate theprice per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:27 cents
($27K/100K IOPS) per vs$1.25 for disk.With the obvious benefits of giant SSD
machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it's interesting to consider: what
architecture decisions might you make differently in the future?More Headroom
for Vertical Scaling Simplifies EverythingThe beauty of higher hardware
performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows
developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This
has always been the allure ofvertical scalingand is well realized by SSDs
through a combination of high throughput, low latencies, and just as
important, high densities.We have a few early examples showing the performance
punch of the n</p><p>5 0.94897634 <a title="1251-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-05-HotPads_Shows_the_True_Cost_of_Hosting_on_Amazon.html">619 high scalability-2009-06-05-HotPads Shows the True Cost of Hosting on Amazon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mather Corgan, president of HotPads,gave a great talkon how HotPads uses AWS
to run their real estate search engine. I loved the presentation for a few
reasons:It gives real costs on on their servers, how many servers they have,
what they are used for, and exactly how they use S2, EBS, CloudFront and other
AWS services. This is great information for anybody trying to architect a
system and wondering where to run it.HotPads is a "real" application. It's a
small company and at 4.5 million page-views/month it's large but not super
large. It has custom server side components like indexing engines, image
processing, and background database update engines for syncing new real estate
data. And it also stores a lot of images and has low latency requirements.This
a really good example mix of where many companies are or would like to be with
their applications.Their total costs are about $11K/month, which is about what
they were paying at their previous provider. I found this is a little

<p>Introduction: Perhaps it is because the whole world feels as if it’s riding on the edge of a jagged knife that the idea of   resilience    is becoming a dominant theme across so many domains. Resilience in beings first developed when cells evolved a way of    maintaining inner order    through homeostatic (stability through constancy) mechanisms. After homeostasis was mastered,    allostasis    (stability through change) developed as a way of responding to a dynamic world of challenge. In economics we have the idea of    Transition Towns   , which emphasizes developing local economies as a way of being resilient to global failures. In agriculture we have the idea of    permaculture   , building a permanent agriculture by embracing diversity, sustainability, perennial systems, avoiding monocultures, and using    edge thinking   . There are many more examples, including    psychological resilience    and the legendary    resilience of ecosystems   .

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear?

<p>Introduction: Someone reading my now ancient  C++ coding standard  recommendation for using doxygen to automatically generate documentation from source code, asked a great question:      I've often considered using doxygen, I always ask myself - is this really useful? Would I use it if I were new to a project? Would programmers working on the project use it?  
I'll rephrase their question to more conveniently express a point I've thought a lot about:  Why do companies put so little effort into automating their own development process to make development easier? 
 
It's like the hair stylist whose own hair looks like someone cut it using a late night infomercial vacuum cleaner attachment. Or it's like the interior decorator whose own house looks like a monk's cell.
 
Software organizations rarely build software to make developing software easier. Why is that?
        Because there are three ways changes are made in an organization:

It consisted of a twin pipe distribution system made in part of compacted soil and in part of wood for the crossings of the aqueduct over the bridges built to allow the passage of the canoes. It was finished around 1466 AD, and the main purpose was to supply fresh water to Mexico-Tenochtitlan, to mitigate its thirst.


The main source for the aqueduct was the spring of Chapultepec and the purpose of the twin pipes was to ease the maintenance of the system, because the water was conveyed through one pipe, and when it got dirty, the water was diverted to the other pipe</p><p>5 0.81896967 <a title="1379-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-16-Scaling_Traffic%3A_People_Pod_Pool_of_On_Demand_Self_Driving_Robotic_Cars_who_Automatically_Refuel_from_Cheap_Solar.html">657 high scalability-2009-07-16-Scaling Traffic: People Pod Pool of On Demand Self Driving Robotic Cars who Automatically Refuel from Cheap Solar</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Since  The Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage  was published we've a had few updates that people might not have seen. Amazon of course released their  Summary of the Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS Service Disruption in the US East Region . Netlix shared their  Lessons Learned from the AWS Outage  as did Heroku ( How Heroku Survived the Amazon Outage ), Smug Mug ( How SmugMug survived the Amazonpocalypse ), and SimpleGeo ( How SimpleGeo Stayed Up During the AWS Downtime ). 
 
The curious thing from my perspective is the general lack of response to Amazon's explanation. I expected more discussion. There's been almost none that I've seen. My guess is very few people understand what Amazon was talking about enough to comment whereas almost everyone feels qualified to talk about the event itself.
 
 Lesson for crisis handlers : deep dive post-mortems that are timely, long, honestish, and highly technical are the most effective means of staunching the downward spiral of media attention.</p><p>2 0.93182886 <a title="1379-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-25-The_Big_List_of_Articles_on_the_Amazon_Outage.html">1029 high scalability-2011-04-25-The Big List of Articles on the Amazon Outage</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Please see  The Updated Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage  for a new improved list. 
 
So many great articles have been written on the Amazon Outage. Some aim at being helpful, some chastise developers for being so stupid, some chastise Amazon for being so incompetent, some talk about the pain they and their companies have experienced, and some even predict the downfall of the cloud. Still others say we have seen a sea change in future of the cloud, a prediction that's hard to disagree with, though the shape of the change remains...cloudy.
 
I'll try to keep this list update as more information comes out. There will be a lot for developers to consider going forward. If there's a resource you think should be added, just let me know.

<p>Introduction: Update:   Arjen  links to video  Supporting Scalable Online Statistical Processing  which shows "rather than doing complete aggregates, use statistical sampling to provide a reasonable estimate (unbiased guess) of the result."  When you have a lot of data,  sampling  allows you to draw conclusions from a much smaller amount of data. That's why sampling is a scalability solution. If you don't have to process all your data to get the information you need then you've made the problem smaller and you'll need fewer resources and you'll get more timely results.
   
 Sampling is not useful when you need a complete list that matches a specific criteria. If you need to know the exact set of people who bought a car in the last week then sampling won't help.  But, if you want to know many people bought a car then you could take a sample and then create estimate of the full data-set. The difference is you won't really know the exact car count. You'll have a confidence interval saying how confident</p><p>4 0.8919968 <a title="1379-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-29-Pinboard.in_Architecture_-_Pay_to_Play_to_Keep_a_System_Small__.html">965 high scalability-2010-12-29-Pinboard.in Architecture - Pay to Play to Keep a System Small  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you keep a system small enough, while still being successful, that a simple scale-up strategy becomes the preferred architecture?  StackOverflow , for example, could stick with a tool chain they were comfortable with because they had a natural brake on how fast they could grow: there are only so many programmers in the world. If this doesn't work for you, here's another natural braking strategy to consider:  charge for your service .  Paul Houle  summarized this nicely as:  avoid scaling problems by building a service that's profitable at a small scale .
 
This interesting point, one I hadn't properly considered before, was brought up by Maciej Ceglowski, co-founder of  Pinboard.in , in an interview with Leo Laporte and Amber MacArthur on their their  net@night  show.
 
Pinboard is a lean, mean, pay for bookmarking machine, a timely replacement for the nearly departed Delicious.

<p>Introduction: There's a new clustered file system on the spindle:   Kosmos File System (KFS)  .  Thanks to Rich Skrenta for turning me on to KFS and I think his blog   post   says it all.  KFS is an open source project written in C++ by search startup   Kosmix  . The team members have a good   pedigree   so there's a better than average chance this software will be worth considering.     After you stop trying to turn KFS into "Kentucky Fried File System" in your mind,  take a look at KFS' intriguing feature set:           Incremental scalability: New chunkserver nodes can be added as storage needs increase; the system automatically adapts to the new nodes.  Availability: Replication is used to provide availability due to chunk server failures. Typically, files are replicated 3-way.   Per file degree of replication: The degree of replication is configurable on a per file basis, with a max. limit of 64.   Re-replication: Whenever the degree of replication for a file drops below the configured amount (</p><p>6 0.88596773 <a title="1379-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-01-Scale-out_vs_Scale-up.html">891 high scalability-2010-09-01-Scale-out vs Scale-up</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is an interview with   MemSQL    cofounder’s    Eric Frenkiel    and    Nikita Shamgunov   , in which they try to answer critics by going into more depth about their technology.     MemSQL ruffled a few feathers with their claim of being the fastest database in the world. According to their benchmarks MemSQL can execute 200K TPS on an EC2   Quadruple   Extra Large   and on a 64 core machine they can push 1.2 million transactions a second.     Benchmarks are always a dark mirror, so make of them what you will, but the target market for MemSQL is clear: projects looking for something both fast and familiar. Fast as in a novel design using a combination of technologies like    MVCC   , code generation,    lock-free data structures   ,    skip lists   , and    in-memory execution   . Familiar as in SQL and nothing but SQL. The only interface to MemSQL is SQL.    It’s right to point out MemSQL gets a boost by being a first release. Only a limited subset of SQL is supported, neither rep</p><p>3 0.25867635 <a title="1298-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-02-Ask_DuckDuckGo%3A_Is_there_Anything_you_Want_to_Know_About_DDG%3F.html">1295 high scalability-2012-08-02-Ask DuckDuckGo: Is there Anything you Want to Know About DDG?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In  MemSQL Architecture  we learned one of the core strategies MemSQL uses to achieve their need for speed is lock-free skip lists. Skip lists are used to efficiently handle range queries. Making the skip-lists lock-free helps eliminate contention and make writes fast. 
 
If this all sounds a little pie-in-the-sky then here's a very good paper on the subject that might help make it clearer:  A Provably Correct Scalable Concurrent Skip List .
 
From the abstract:
  We propose a new concurrent skip list algorithm distinguished by a combination of simplicity and scalability. The algorithm employs optimistic synchronization, searching without acquiring locks, followed by short lock-based validation before adding or removing nodes. It also logically removes an item before physically unlinking it. Unlike some other concurrent skip list algorithms, this algorithm preserves the skiplist properties at all times, which facilitates reasoning about its correctness. Experimental evidence shows that</p><p>5 0.070921697 <a title="1298-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-03-Read_This_Site_and_Ace_Your_Next_Interview%21.html">264 high scalability-2008-03-03-Read This Site and Ace Your Next Interview!</a></p>

My eyes immediately latched on to one of his key example scenarios, which involves scaling Facebook:           Facebook     ● What was Facebook day 1?   – A database with a PHP front-end   ● In PHP, Java, C#, whatever   – How long would it take you to reproduce Facebook's first incarnation?   ● A single MySQL instance with some simple queries probably used to happily query the whole userbase.       Facebook     ● What is it today?   ● Its not about “that stuff you learned in school”   – Its about what a company with thousands of (possibly conflicting) queries per second operating   on a directed-graph with 50 million nodes   ● And of course a few Petabytes of data   ● And 99.99% uptime   ● Design decision? A Facebook user is (or recently was) currently limited to 5000 friends.

<p>Introduction: It looks like in the near future I'll have a chance to interview the Elastra CEO. Elastra provides standard   databases--MySQL, EnterpriseDB and PostgreSQL-- on top of EC2 and S3. They are selling aggressive pricing, expandable and contactable database resource usage in response to demand, and a simple management and operations interface to well known databases deployed in a cloud. Elastra could be an important option for developers looking for a more traditional cloudy database.      I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions for questions you would like answered? What would you like to know about their service? What are you looking for in a cloudy database? What would stop you from adopting it or what would make you decide to adopt it? Any ideas you have would help a lot and will probably be better than anything I have.</p><p>4 0.5103488 <a title="1298-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-25-Application_Database_and_DAL_Architecture.html">222 high scalability-2008-01-25-Application Database and DAL Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi gurus, I'm totally new to this high scalability thing. I'm trying to create a website with scalability in mind (personal project). In my application I'll have forums for different groups of people (each group will have their own forums, members of groups can still post in other groups' forums but each group will mainly be using their forums most of the time). Now, I'm going to start with about 2000 groups with the potential of reaching up to 10000 groups (this is the maximum due to the nature of my application). I was thinking that having all posts in one table will be way too much for one table (esp. that some groups are expected to post hundreds or even thousands times per day, let's say about 500 of the groups, the rest of the groups won't be that active though) as I'll have to index the PostID, ParentPostID, GroupID and PostDate which can produce large indexes (consequentially causing slow inserts) if having everything in one table. So, I'm thinking of a way to divide the posts</p><p>5 0.50764912 <a title="1298-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-15-Does_Sun_Buying_MySQL_Change_Your_Scaling_Strategy%3F.html">213 high scalability-2008-01-15-Does Sun Buying MySQL Change Your Scaling Strategy?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sun is buying MySQL for $1 billion. The MySQL team has worked long and hard so I don't begrudge them their pay day. Strike while the iron is offering a lot of cash I say. And I have nothing against Sun. Yet I can't help but think this changes the mental calculation of what database to use. When Oracle acquired Innobase  a new independent storage engine was needed for MySQL. How is this different? Does this change your thinking any? Would Martha say it's a good thing? Like Luke I've searched my feelings, but the force is not with me and I don't really know how I feel about it.</p><p>6 0.46537071 <a title="1298-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-08-1dbase_vs._many_and_cloud_hosting_vs._dedicated_server%28s%29%3F.html">675 high scalability-2009-08-08-1dbase vs. many and cloud hosting vs. dedicated server(s)?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a repost of the blog entry written by NuoDB's  Tommy Reilly  .  
 
We at  NuoDB  were recently given the opportunity to kick the tires on the  Google Compute Engine  by our friends over at Google. You can watch the entire Google Developer Live Session by clicking  here .  In order to access the capabilities of GCE we decided to run the same  YCSB  based benchmark we ran at our  General Availability Launch  back in January. For those of you who missed it we demonstrated running the YCSB benchmark on a 24 machine cluster running on our private cloud in the NuoDB datacenter. The salient results were 1.7 million transactions per second with sub-millisecond latencies.
 
Public cloud environments typically mean virtualization, inconsistent network performance and potentially slow or low bandwidth disk access. It just so happens that NuoDB was designed to work well in such harsh environments (we don’t call it a cloud database for nothing). Still, the faster the CPU, network and disk t</p><p>5 0.51623142 <a title="1298-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-08-file_synchronization_solutions.html">488 high scalability-2009-01-08-file synchronization solutions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have two servers connected via Internet (NOT IN THE SAME LAN) serving the same website (http://www.ourexample.com).The problem is files uploaded on serverA and serverB cannot see each other immediately,thus rsync with certain intervals is not a good solution.   Can anybody give me some advice on the following options?     1.NFS over Internet for file sharing   2.sshfs   3.inotify(our system's kernel does not support this and we donot want to risk upgrading our kernel as well)    4.drbd in active-active mode   5 or any other solutions     Any suggestions will be welcomed.   Thank you in advance.</p><p>6 0.51551002 <a title="1298-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-26-Product%3A_Symfony_a_Web_Framework.html">31 high scalability-2007-07-26-Product: Symfony a Web Framework</a></p>

<p>Introduction: SinceThe Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage was published we've a had
few updates that people might not have seen. Amazon of course released their
Summary of the Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS Service Disruption in the US East
Region. Netlix shared theirLessons Learned from the AWS Outage as did Heroku
(How Heroku Survived the Amazon Outage), Smug Mug (How SmugMug survived the
Amazonpocalypse), and SimpleGeo (How SimpleGeo Stayed Up During the AWS
Downtime). The curious thing from my perspective is the general lack of
response to Amazon's explanation. I expected more discussion. There's been
almost none that I've seen. My guess is very few people understand what Amazon
was talking about enough to comment whereas almost everyone feels qualified to
talk about the event itself.Lesson for crisis handlers: deep dive post-mortems
that are timely, long, honestish, and highly technical are the most effective
means of staunching the downward spiral of media attention. Amazon's

<p>Introduction: Please seeThe Updated Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage for a new
improved list.So many great articles have been written on the Amazon Outage.
Some aim at being helpful, some chastise developers for being so stupid, some
chastise Amazon for being so incompetent, some talk about the pain they and
their companies have experienced, and some even predict the downfall of the
cloud. Still others say we have seen a sea change in future of the cloud, a
prediction that's hard to disagree with, though the shape of the change
remains...cloudy.I'll try to keep this list update as more information comes
out. There will be a lot for developers to consider going forward. If there's
a resource you think should be added, just let me know.Amazon's Explanation of

<p>Introduction: Raymond Blumleads a team of Site Reliability Engineers charged with keeping
Google's data secret and keeping it safe. Of course Google would never say how
much data this actually is, but from comments it seems that it is not yet
ayottabyte, but is manyexabytesin size. GMail alone is approaching low
exabytes of data.Mr. Blum, in the video How Google Backs Up the Internet,
explained common backup strategies don't work for Google for a very googly
sounding reason: typically theyscale effort with capacity. If backing up twice
as much data requires twice as much stuff to do it, where stuff is time,
energy, space, etc., it won't work, it doesn't scale.  You have to find
efficiencies so that capacity can scale faster than the effort needed to
support that capacity. A different plan is needed when making the jump from
backing up one exabyte to backing up two exabytes. And the talk is largely
about how Google makes that happen.Some major themes of the talk:No data loss,
ever. Even the infamous</p><p>6 0.11145694 <a title="1209-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-21-This_is_why_Microsoft_won._And_why_they_lost..html">1635 high scalability-2014-04-21-This is why Microsoft won. And why they lost.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Steve Newman, co-founder of Writely (Google Docs),
tech lead on the Paxos-based synchronous replication in Megastore, and founder
of cloud service providerScalyr.com.Microsoft's Azure service suffered a

<p>Introduction: With a new Planet of the Apes coming out, this may be a touchy subject with
our new overlords, but Netflix is using a whole lot more trouble injecting
monkeys to test and iteratively harden their systems. We learned previously
how Netflix used Chaos Monkey, a tool to test failover handling by
continuously failing EC2 nodes. That was just a start. More monkeys have been
added to the barrel. Node failure is just one problem in a system. Imagine a
problem and you can imagine creating a monkey to test if your system is
handling that problem properly. Yury Izrailevsky talks about just this
approach in this very interesting post: The Netflix Simian Army.I know what
you are thinking, if monkeys are so great then why has Netflix been down
lately. Dmuino addressedthis potential embarrassment, putting all fears of
cloud inferiority to rest:Unfortunately we're not running 100% on the cloud
today. We're working on it, and we could use more help. The latest outage was
caused by a component that sti</p><p>3 0.80691689 <a title="1209-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-27-Heroku_Emergency_Strategy%3A_Incident_Command_System_and_8_Hour_Ops_Rotations_for_Fresh_Minds.html">1030 high scalability-2011-04-27-Heroku Emergency Strategy: Incident Command System and 8 Hour Ops Rotations for Fresh Minds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In Resolved: Widespread Application Outage, Herokutells their story of how
they dealt with theAmazon outage. While taking 100% responsibility for the
downtime, they also shared a number of the strategies they used to bring their
service back to full working order.One ofHeroku'smost interesting strategies
wasn't a technical hack at all, but how they consciously went about deploying
their Ops personnel in response to the emergency. An outline of their strategy
is: Monitoring systems immediately alerted Ops to the problem. An on-call
engineer applied triage logic to the problem and classified it as serious,
which caused the on-callIncident Commanderto be woken out of restful slumber.

<p>Introduction: We can all learn from problems. The Google App Engine team has created a
teachable moment through a remarkably honest and forthcomingpost-mortem for
February 24th, 2010 outagepost, chronicling in elaborate detail a power outage
that took down Google App Engine for a few hours.The world is ending! The
cloud is unreliable! Jump ship! Not. This is not evidence that the cloud is a
beautiful, powerful and unsinkable ship that goes down on its maiden voyage.
Stuff happens, no matter how well you prepare. If you think private
datacenters don't go down, well, then I have some rearangeable deck chairs to
sell you. The goal is to keep improving and minimizing those failure windows.
From that perspective there is a lot to learn from the problems the Google App
Engine team encountered and how they plan to fix them.Please read the article
for all the juicy details, but here's what struck me as key:Power fails. Plan
for it. This seems to happen with unexpected frequency for such expensive and

<p>Introduction: In 5 Lessons We've Learned Using AWS, Netflix's John Ciancutti says the best
way to avoid failure is to fail constantly. In the cloud it's expected
instances can fail at any time, so you always have to be prepared. In the real
world we prepare by running drills. Remember all those exciting fire drills?
It's not just fire drills of course. The military, football teams, fire
fighters, beach rescue, virtually any entity that must react quickly and
efficiently to disaster hones their responsiveness by running drills.Netflix
aggressively moves this strategy into the cloud by randomly failing servers
using a tool they built called Chaos Monkey. The idea is:If we aren't
constantly testing our ability to succeed despite failure, then it isn't
likely to work when it matters most - in the event of an unexpected
outage.They respond to failures bydegrading service, but they always
respond:If the recommendations system is down they'll show popular titles
instead.If the search system is slow then th</p><p>6 0.73491168 <a title="1209-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-19-What_can_the_Amazing_Race_to_the_South_Pole_Teach_us_About_Startups%3F.html">1503 high scalability-2013-08-19-What can the Amazing Race to the South Pole Teach us About Startups?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: My apologies if you were looking for a post about cell phones. This post is
about high density nanodevices. It's a follow up toHow will memristors change
everything? for those wishing to pursue these revolutionary ideas in more
depth. This is one of those areas where if you are in the space then there's a
lot of available information and if you are on the outside then it doesn't
even seem to exist. Fortunately, Ben Chandler from The SyNAPSE Project, was
kind enough to point me to a great set of presentations given at the12th IEEE
CNNA - International Workshop on Cellular Nanoscale Networks and their
Applications- Towards Megaprocessor Computing. WARNING: these papers contain
extreme technical content. If you are like me and you aren't an electrical
engineer, much of it may make a sort of surface sense, but the deep and twisty
details will fly over head. For the more software minded there are a couple
more accessible presentations:Intelligent Machines built with Memristive

<p>Introduction: You go through the expense of installing CDNs all over the globe to make sure
users always have a node close by and you notice something curious and
furious: clients still experience poor latencies. What's up with that? What do
you do to find the problem? If you are Google you build a tool (WhyHigh) to
figure out what's up. This paper is about the tool and the unexpected problem
ofhigh latencieson CDNs. The main problems they found: inefficient routing to
nearby nodes and packet queuing. But more useful is the architecture of
WhyHigh and how it goes about identifying bottle necks. And even more useful
is the general belief in creating sophisticated tools to understand and
improve your service. That's what professionals do. From the
abstract:Replicating content across a geographically distributed set of
servers and redirecting clients to the closest server in terms of latency has
emerged as a common paradigm for improving client performance. In this paper,
we analyze latencies measured</p><p>3 0.95663893 <a title="1209-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-15-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_Oct_15_2009_.html">722 high scalability-2009-10-15-Hot Scalability Links for Oct 15 2009 </a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Steve Newman, co-founder of Writely (Google Docs),
tech lead on the Paxos-based synchronous replication in Megastore, and founder
of cloud service providerScalyr.com.Microsoft's Azure service suffered a
widely publicized outage on February 28th / 29th. Microsoft recently published
an excellentpostmortem. For anyone trying to run a high-availability service,
this incident can teach several important lessons.The central lesson is that,
no matter how much work you put into redundancy, problems will arise. Murphy
is strong and, I might say, creative; things go wrong. So preventative
measures are important, but how you react to problems is just as important.
It's interesting to review the Azure incident in this light.The postmortem is
worth reading in its entirety, but here's a quick summary: each time Azure
launches a new VM, it creates a "transfer certificate" to secure
communications with that VM. There was a bug in the code that determines the
certificate expirat</p><p>5 0.94662845 <a title="1209-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-11-RAMCube%3A_Exploiting_Network_Proximity_for_RAM-Based_Key-Value_Store.html">1338 high scalability-2012-10-11-RAMCube: Exploiting Network Proximity for RAM-Based Key-Value Store</a></p>
<p>Introduction: RAMCube is a datacenter oriented design for RAM-based key-value store that
supports thousands or tens of thousands of servers to offer up to hundreds of
terabytes of RAM storage. Here's thePDF Paper describing the system and here's
avideo of the presentationgiven atHotCloud.The big idea is: RAMCube exploits
the proximity of a BCube network to construct a symmetric MultiRing structure,
restricting all failure detection and recovery trafﬁc within a one-hop
neighborhood, which addresses problems including false failure detection and
recovery trafﬁc congestion. In addition, RAMCube leverages BCube's multiple
paths between any pairs of servers to handle switch failures.A few notes:75%
of Facebook data is stored in memcache.RAM is 1000 time faster than diskRAM is
used in caches, but this increases application complexity as applications are
responsible for cache consistency.Under a high work load a 1% cache miss rate
can lead to a 10x performance penalty.So store data directly in RAM instead</p><p>6 0.93492377 <a title="1209-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-17-10_eBay_Secrets_for_Planet_Wide_Scaling.html">742 high scalability-2009-11-17-10 eBay Secrets for Planet Wide Scaling</a></p>

<p>Introduction: What should the architecture of your scalable, real-time, highly available service look like? There are as many options as there are developers, but if you are looking for a general template, this architecture as described by Prashant Malik, Facebook's lead for the  Messages  back end team, in  Scaling the Messages Application Back End , is a very good example to consider. 
 
Although Messages is tasked with handling 135+ billion messages a month, from email, IM, SMS,  text messages, and Facebook messages, you may think this is an example of BigArchitecture and doesn't apply to smaller sites. Not so. It's a good, well thought out example of a non-cloud architecture exhibiting many qualities any mom would be proud of:
  
  Layered  - components are independent and isolated.  
  Service/API Driven  - each layer is connected via well defined interface that is the sole entry point for accessing that service. This prevents nasty complicated interdependencies.

Not so. It's a good, well thought out example of a non-cloud architecture exhibiting many qualities any mom would be proud of:
  
  Layered  - components are independent and isolated.  
  Service/API Driven  - each layer is connected via well defined interface that is the sole entry point for accessing that service. This prevents nasty complicated interdependencies.

<p>Introduction: A consequence of Service Oriented Architectures is the burning need to provide services at scale. The architecture that has evolved to satisfy these requirements is a little known technique called the Cell Architecture.  A Cell Architecture is based on the idea that massive scale requires parallelization and parallelization requires components be isolated from each other. These islands of isolation are called cells. A cell is a self-contained installation that can satisfy all the operations for a  shard . A shard is a subset of a much larger dataset, typically a range of users, for example.   Cell Architectures have several advantages:
  
 Cells provide a unit of parallelization that can be adjusted to any size as the user base grows. 
 Cell are added in an incremental fashion as more capacity is required. 
 Cells isolate failures. One cell failure does not impact other cells. 
 Cells provide isolation as the storage and application horsepower to process requests is independent of othe</p><p>2 0.91497684 <a title="1242-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-01-Google_Paper%3A_Large-scale_Incremental_Processing_Using_Distributed_Transactions_and_Notifications.html">912 high scalability-2010-10-01-Google Paper: Large-scale Incremental Processing Using Distributed Transactions and Notifications</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This paper,  Large-scale Incremental Processing Using Distributed Transactions and Notifications  by Daniel Peng and Frank Dabek, is Google's much anticipated description of Percolator, their new  real-time indexing  system.
 
The abstract:
  
 Updating an index of the web as documents are crawled requires continuously transforming a large repository of existing documents as new documents arrive. This task is one example of a class of data processing tasks that transform a large repository of data via small, independent mutations. These tasks lie in a gap between the capabilities of existing infrastructure. Databases do not meet the storage or throughput requirements of these tasks: Google’s indexing system stores tens of petabytes of data and processes billions of updates per day on thousands of machines. MapReduce and other batch-processing systems cannot process small updates individually as they rely on creating large batches for efﬁciency.

<p>Introduction: When building a system on top of a set of wildly uncooperative and unruly computers you have knowledge problems: knowing when other nodes are dead; knowing when nodes become alive; getting information about other nodes so you can make local decisions, like knowing which node should handle a request based on a scheme for assigning nodes to a certain range of users; learning about new configuration data; agreeing on data values; and so on.
 
How do you solve these problems? 
 
A common centralized approach is to use a database and all nodes query it for information. Obvious availability and performance issues for large distributed clusters. Another approach is to use  Paxos , a protocol for solving consensus in a network to maintain strict consistency requirements for small groups of unreliable processes. Not practical when larger number of nodes are involved.
 
So what's the super cool decentralized way to bring order to large clusters?

<p>Introduction: Salvatore Sanfilippo  wrote a response  to Michel Martens'  An Open Minded Reader . There's nothing in the post or response that's controversial. I was just struck at what a clear explication the conversation was on all the effort that goes into optimizing read paths. We optimize reads through denormalisation, a crazy quilt of caching layers, key-value databases, clustering of related tables, SSD/RAM, DHTs, moving functions to storage, secondary indexes, separating OLAP from OLTP, etc etc. We often focus so much on specific techniques that we can forget the bigger picture of what's going on. This little exchange made me look again at the forest, not just the trees.
 
Michel Martens:
  

What does it mean to use Redis as a traditional database? If it means to save all your data and expect to retrieve it later in new and creative ways, then we have to agree that better tools are available. It is one of Redis tradeoffs: you have to think in advance how you will want to get your data back.</p><p>5 0.90039706 <a title="1242-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-08-Update_on_Scalable_Causal_Consistency_For_Wide-Area_Storage_With_COPS.html">1153 high scalability-2011-12-08-Update on Scalable Causal Consistency For Wide-Area Storage With COPS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here are a few updates on the article  Paper: Don’t Settle For Eventual: Scalable Causal Consistency For Wide-Area Storage With COPS  from Mike Freedman and Wyatt Lloyd.
 
 Q: How software architectures could change in response to casual+ consistency? 
 
 A : I don't really think they would much. Somebody would still run a two-tier architecture in their datacenter:  a front-tier of webservers running both (say) PHP and our client library, and a back tier of storage nodes running COPS.  (I'm not sure if it was obvious given the discussion of our "thick" client -- you should think of the COPS client dropping in where a memcache client library does...albeit ours has per-session state.)
 
 
 
 Q: Why not just use vector clocks? 
 
 A : The problem with vector clocks and scalability has always been that the size of vector clocks in O(N), where N is the number of nodes.  So if we want to scale to a datacenter with 10K nodes, each piece of metadata must have size O(10K).  And in fact, vector</p><p>6 0.89264345 <a title="1242-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-21-Google%27s_Sanjay_Ghemawat_on_What_Made_Google_Google_and_Great_Big_Data_Career_Advice.html">1535 high scalability-2013-10-21-Google's Sanjay Ghemawat on What Made Google Google and Great Big Data Career Advice</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add
cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case.
Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we
don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL
hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to
deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is
Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on
Fotolog inSecrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success, which was one of my personal
favorites.Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site
nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog
has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G
available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding
performance and scaling requirements. To meet those requirements they've
developed a soph</p><p>3 0.14258049 <a title="1346-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-10-Shard_servers_--_go_big_or_small%3F.html">383 high scalability-2008-09-10-Shard servers -- go big or small?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hello everyone,I'm designing a website/widget that my business partner and I
expect to serve millions of hits daily. As such we must shard our database
(and we're designing with shards in mind right from the beginning). However,
the one thing I haven't been able to figure out from Googling is the best
hardware to go with for shards. I'm using exclusively InnoDB tables.We'll
(eventually) be running 3 groups of database servers:a) Session servers for
php sessions. These will have a very high write volume.b) ID servers. These
will match a couple primary indices (such as user ID) to a given shard. These
will have an intense read load, plus a moderate amount of writes.c) Shard
servers. These will hold the bulk of the data. These will have a high read
load and a lowish write load.Group A is done as a database instead of using
memcached so users aren't logged out if a memcached server goes down. As the
write load is high, a pair of high performance master-master servers seems
obvious. What's</p><p>4 0.14040482 <a title="1346-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-02-Strategy%3A_How_to_Manage_Sessions_Using_Memcached.html">436 high scalability-2008-11-02-Strategy: How to Manage Sessions Using Memcached</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dormandoshows an enlightened middle wayfor storing sessions in cache and the
database. Sessions are a perfect cache candidate because they are transient,
smallish, and since they are usually accessed on every page access removing
all that load from the database is a good thing. But as Dormando points out
session caches have problems. If you remove expiration times from the cache
and you run out of memory then no more logins. If a cache server fails or
needs to be upgrade then you just logged out a bunch of potentially angry
users.The middle ground Dormando proposes is using both the cache and the
database:Reads: read from the cache first, then the database. Typical cache
logic.Writes: write to memcached every time, write to the database every N
seconds (assuming the data has changed).There's a small chance of data loss,
but you've still greatly reduced the database load while providing
reliability. Nice solution.</p><p>5 0.13602544 <a title="1346-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-27-Handle_700_Percent_More_Requests_Using_Squid_and_APC_Cache.html">662 high scalability-2009-07-27-Handle 700 Percent More Requests Using Squid and APC Cache</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thisposton www.ilovebonnie.net documents some impressive system performance
improvements by the addition ofSquid Cache(a caching proxy) andAPC
Cache(opcode cache for PHP).Apache is able to deliver roughly 700% more
requests per second with Squid when serving 1KB and 100KB images.Server load
is reduced using Squid because the server does not have to create a bunch of
Apache processes to handle the requests.APC Cache took a system that could
barely handle 10-20 requests per second to handling 50-60 requests per second.
A 400% increase.APC allowed the load times to remain under 5 seconds even with
200 concurrent threads slamming on the server.These two caches are easy to
setup and install and allow you to get a lot more performance out of them.The
post has an in-depth discussion and a number of supporting charts. The primary
point is how simple it can be to improve performance and scalability by adding
caching.</p><p>6 0.13260953 <a title="1346-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-16-%5BANN%5D_New_Open_Source_Cache_System.html">467 high scalability-2008-12-16-[ANN] New Open Source Cache System</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:AsynchronousHTTP cache validations. A proposed HTTP caching
extension:if your application can afford to show slightly out of date content,
then stale-while-revalidate can guarantee that the user will always be served
directly from the cache, hence guaranteeing a consistent response-time user-
experience.Caching is like aspirin for headaches. Head hurts: pop a 'sprin.
Slow site: add caching.Facebookmust have a lot of headaches because they
popped 805 memcached servers between 10,000 web servers and 1,800 MySQL
servers and they reportedly have a 99% cache hit rate. But what's the best way
for you to cache for your application? It's a remarkably complex and rich
topic. Alexey Kovyrin talks about one common caching problem called theDog

<p>Introduction: Ehcacheis a pure Java cache with the following features: fast, simple, small
foot print, minimal dependencies, provides memory and disk stores for
scalability into gigabytes, scalable to hundreds of cachesis a pluggable cache
for Hibernate, tuned for high concurrent load on large multi-cpu servers,
provides LRU, LFU and FIFO cache eviction policies, and is production tested.
Ehcache is used byLinkedInto cache member profiles. The user guide says it's
possible to get at 2.5 times system speedup for persistent Object Relational
Caching, a 1000 times system speedup for Web Page Caching, and a 1.6 times
system speedup Web Page Fragment Caching.From the
website:breakIntroductionEhcache is a cache library. Before getting into
ehcache, it is worth stepping back and thinking about caching generally.About
CachesWiktionary defines a cache as A store of things that will be required in

<p>Introduction: Tugela Cacheis a cache system like memecached, but instead of storing data
just in RAM, it stores data in the file system using a b-tree. You trade
latency in order to have a very large cache. It's useful for sites that have
caching requirements that exceed their available memory. It uses the same wire
protocol asmemcachedso it can be dropped in without a hassle. From the
website:As large MediaWiki deployments may gain performance using Memcached,
at some level cost of RAM to store all objects becomes too high. In order to
balance resource usage and make more use of our Apache server disks, Tugela,
the distributed cached on-disk hash database, has arrived.Tugela Cache is
derived from Memcached. Much of the code remains the same, but notably, these
changes:Internal slab allocator replaced by BerkeleyDB B-Tree database.Expiry
policy management moved to external program tugela-expireMuch statistics code

<p>Introduction: This is aguest repost bySriram Devadas, Engineer at Vistaprint, Web platform
group. A fun and well written analogy of how to scale web applications using a
familiar coffee shop as an example. No coffee was harmed during the making of
this post.I own a small coffee shop.My expense is proportional to resources100
square feet of built up area with utilities, 1 barista, 1 cup coffee maker.My
shop's capacityServes 1 customer at a time, takes 3 minutes to brew a cup of
coffee, a total of 5 minutes to serve a customer.Since my barista works
without breaks and the German made coffee maker never breaks down,my shop's
maximum throughput = 12 customers per hour. Web serverCustomers walk away
during peak hours. We only serve one customer at a time. There is no space to
wait.I upgrade shop. My new setup is better!ExpensesSame area and utilities, 3
baristas, 2 cup coffee maker, 2 chairsCapacity3 minutes to brew 2 cups of

<p>Introduction: Hi...I have this idea to start a really great and scalable website, and I am
building it! So far I'm doing everything myself - coding, networking,
architecture planning, everything. I haven't even gotten into the legal
aspects yet.......It would be MUCH easier if I had a technical person to
handle that end of the operation. I'm a good coder, but like Bill Gates at
Harvard for Math, I'm not the very best. I'd like to FIND that very best
person available, to handle the technical aspects. For worse or better, I
don't presently know somebody who fits this bill.I've posted a bazillion ads
on Craig's List, with no really qualified responses. I've put out feelers
among my own network, same result. Not sure what else I can do. Shoestring
budget, so it's sweat equity in the beginning. That can actually be a plus, as
it forces people to focus.Any ideas about what else I can do, to attract the
right person?ThanksJason</p><p>same-blog 4 0.92267162 <a title="1346-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-24-Saving_Cash_Using_Less_Cache_-__90%25_Savings_in_the_Caching_Tier.html">1346 high scalability-2012-10-24-Saving Cash Using Less Cache -  90% Savings in the Caching Tier</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a paper delivered at HotCloud '12 by a group from CMU and Intel Labs,
Saving Cash by Using Less Cache (slides,  pdf), they show it may be possible
to use less DRAM under low load conditions to save on operational costs. There
are some issues with this idea, but in a give me more cache era, it could be
an interesting source of cost savings for your product. Caching is used
to:Reduce load on the database.Reduce latency.Problem:RAM in the cloud is
quite expensive. A third of costs can come from the caching tier.Solution:
Shrink your cache when the load is lower. Their work shows when the load drops
below a certain point you can throw away 50% of your cache while still
maintaining performance.A few popular items often account for most of your
hits, implying can remove the cache for the long tail. Use two tiers of
servers, the Retiring Group, which is the group of servers you want to get rid
of. The Primary Group is the group of servers you are keeping. A cache request
goes to both serve</p><p>5 0.91861784 <a title="1346-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-16-Big_List_of_20_Common_Bottlenecks.html">1246 high scalability-2012-05-16-Big List of 20 Common Bottlenecks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: InZen And The Art Of Scaling - A Koan And Epigram Approach,Russell
Sullivanoffered an interesting conjecture: there are 20 classic bottlenecks.
This sounds suspiciously like the idea that there only20 basic story plots.
And depending on how you chunkify things, it may be true, but in practice we
all know bottlenecks come in infinite flavors, all tasting of sour and ash.One
dayAurelien Broszniowskifrom Terracotta emailed me his list of bottlenecks, we
cc'ed Russell in on the conversation, he gave me his list, I have a list, and
here's the resulting stone soup.Russell said this is his "I wish I knew when I
was younger" list and I think that's an enriching way to look at it. The more
experience you have, the more different types of projects you tackle, the more
lessons you'll be able add to a list like this. So when you read this list,
and when you make your own, you are stepping through years of accumulated
experience and more than a little frustration, but in each there is a story

<p>Introduction: We need to measure the number of queries-per-second our site gets for capacity
planning purposes.Obviously, we need to provision the site based on the peak
QPS, not average QPS. There will always be some spikes in traffic, though,
where for one particular second we get a really huge number of queries. It's
ok if site performance slightly degrades during that time. So what I'd really
like to do is estimate the *near* peak QPS based on average or median QPS.
Near peak might be defined as the QPS that I get at the 95th percentile of the
busiest seconds during the day.My guess is that this is similar to what ISPs
do when they measure your bandwidth usage and then charge for usage over the
95th percentile.What we've done is analyzed our logs, counted the queries
executed during each second during the day, sorted from the busiest seconds to
the least busy ones, and graphed it. What you get is a histogram that steeply
declines and flattens out near zero.Does anyone know if there is a

<p>Introduction: Here's a common situation and question from themechanical-sympathyGoogle group
by Avinash Agrawal on the black art of capacity planning:How to get started
with sizing and capacity planning, assuming we don't know the software
behavior and its completely new product to deal with?Gil Tene, Vice President
of Technology and CTO & Co-Founder, wrote a very understandable and useful
answer that is worth highlighting:Start with requirements. I see way too many
"capacity planning" exercises that go off spending weeks measuring some
irrelevant metrics about a system (like how many widgets per hour can this
thing do) without knowing what they actually need it to do.There are two key
sets of metrics to state here: the "how much" set and the "how bad" set:In the
"How Much" part, you need to establish, based on expected business needs,

<p>Introduction: There's some amount of debate whether Facebookreallycrossed over the one
trillion page view per month threshold. While one report says it did,another
respected firm says it did not; that its monthly page views are a mere 467
billion per month.In the big scheme of things, the discrepancy is somewhat
irrelevant, as neither show thetrueload on Facebook's infrastructure - which
is far more impressive a set of numbers than its externally measured "page
view" metric.  Mashable reported in "Facebook Surpasses 1 Trillion Pageviews
per Month" that the social networking giant saw "approximately 870 million
unique visitors in June and 860 million in July" and followed up with some per
visitor statistics, indicating "each visitor averaged approximately 1,160 page
views in July and 40 per visit -- enormous by any standard. Time spent on the
site was around 25 minutes per user."From an architectural standpoint it's
notjustabout the page views. It's about requests and responses, many of which

<p>Introduction: Web Log Stormingis an interactive, desktop-based Web Log Analyzer for Windows.
The whole new concept of log analysis makes it clearly different from any
other web log analyzer. Browse through statistics to get into details - down
to individual visitor's session. Check individual visitor behavior pattern and
how it fits into your desired scenario.Web Log Storming does far more than
just generate common reports - it displays detailed web site statistics with
interactive graphs and reports. Very complete detailed log analysis of
activity from every visitor to your web site is only a mouse-click away.In
other words, analyze your web logs like never before!It's easy to track
sessions, hits, page views, downloads, or whatever metric is most important to
each user. You can look at referring pages and see which search engines and
keywords were used to bring visitors to the site. Web site behavior, from the
top entry and exit pages, to the paths that users follow, can be analyzed. You

<p>Introduction: Fromhttp://directory.fsf.org/project/collectd/:'collectd' is a small daemon
which collects system information every 10 seconds and writes the results in
an RRD-file. The statistics gathered include: CPU and memory usage, system
load, network latency (ping), network interface traffic, and system
temperatures (using lm-sensors), and disk usage. 'collectd' is not a script;
it is written in C for performance and portability. It stays in the memory so
there is no need to start up a heavy interpreter every time new values should
be logged.From the collectd website:Collectd gathers information about the
system it is running on and stores this information. The information can then
be used to do find current performance bottlenecks (i. e. performance
analysis) and predict future system load (i. e. capacity planning). Or if you
just want pretty graphs of your private server and are fed up with some
homegrown solution you're at the right place, too ;).While collectd can do a

<p>Introduction: Release It!authorMichael Nygard tells a tale of two web sites, both brought
low by unexpectedly huge unbounded results sets that slowed down their sites
to the speed of a Christmas checkout line.I've committed this error more than
a few times. During testing the results sets are often small, so you don't see
problems. Or when a product is new you don't have a lot of data so everything
is fine, until some magic line is crossed and you get that dreaded 2AM fix it
call.breakMy most embarrassing bug of this type caused a rather spectacular
failure at a customer site as the variance in response times was out of spec
and this kicked in penalty clauses. What happened was the customer had a
larger network than we could even test (customers always get the good stuff).
I took a lock and went to get all the data. Because the result set was so much
larger in their larger system I took the lock for many more milliseconds than
I should have.

you gotta figure advertisers are ready for the traffic bursts generated by
their expensive ads? Not exactly...Yottaareports an amazing 13 advertiser

asking viewers to vote for the ending of a commercial, but load times went to
62 seconds. SodaStream, Calvin Klein, Axe, Got Milk? The Walking Dead, many
movie sites, and many car sites, all were flagged with delay of fame
penalties.Lots of time, money, and creative energy is spent lovingly
perfecting every detail of these commercials. It won't be a surprise to any
programmer that this can't usually be said of the follow through on the
backend.So what can you do? Yottaa has some good tips and Michael Hamrah has a

<p>Introduction: This guest post is written byJosh Fraser, co-founder and CEO ofTorbit. Torbit
creates tools for measuring, analyzing and optimizing web performance.  Did
you know that 5% of the pageviews on Walmart.com take over 20 seconds to load?
Walmart discovered this recently after adding real user measurement (RUM) to
analyze their web performance for every single visitor to their site. Walmart
used JavaScript to measure their median load time as well as key metrics like
their 95th percentile. While 20 seconds is a long time to wait for a website
to load,the Walmart storyis actually not that uncommon. Remember, this is the
worst 5% of their pageviews, not the typical experience.Walmart's median load
time was reported at around 4 seconds, meaning half of their visitors loaded
Walmart.com faster than 4 seconds and the other half took longer than 4
seconds to load. Using this knowledge, Walmart was prepared to act. By
reducing page load times by even one second, Walmart found that they would

Java VMs. It provides up to a terabyte of virtual heap for Java applications
that spans hundreds of connected JVMs.NAM is best suited for storing what they
call scratch data. Scratch data is defined as object oriented data that is
critical to the execution of a series of Java operations inside the JVM, but
may not be critical once a business transaction is complete.The Terracotta
Architecture has three components:Client Nodes - Each client node corresponds
to a client node in the cluster which runs on a standard JVMServer Cluster -

<p>Introduction: This is an interview with Gabriel Weinberg, founder of Duck Duck Go and
general all around startup guru, on what DDG's architecture looks like in
2012.Innovative search engine upstart DuckDuckGo had30 million searchesin
February 2012 and averages over 1 million searches a day. It's being
positioned bysuper investor Fred Wilsonas a clean, private, impartial and fast
search engine. After talking with Gabriel I like what Fred Wilson said
earlier, it seems closer to the heart of the matter:We invested in DuckDuckGo
for the Reddit, Hacker News anarchists.                  Choosing DuckDuckGo
can be thought of as not just a technical choice, but a vote for revolution.
In an age when knowing your essence is not about about love or friendship, but
about more effectively selling you to advertisers, DDG is positioning
themselves as thedo not track alternative, keepers of theprivacy flame. You
will still be monetized of course, but in a more civilized and anonymous way.

<p>Introduction: Hi,I want to implement a search engine with lucene.To be scalable, I would
like to execute search jobs asynchronously (with a job queuing system).But i
don't know if it is a good design... Why ?Search results can be large ! (eg:
100+ pages with 25 documents per page)With asynchronous sytem, I need to store
results for each search job.I can set a short expiration time (~5 min) for
each search result, but it's still large.What do you think about it ?Which
design would you use for that ?ThanksMat</p><p>5 0.059129231 <a title="1295-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-11-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_11%2C_2013.html">1385 high scalability-2013-01-11-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 11, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Inspired by axkcd comic,Peter Norvig,Director of Research at Google and all
around interesting and nice guy, has created an above par code kata involving
a regex program that demonstrates the core inner loop of many successful
systems profiled on HighScalability.The original code is atxkcd 1313: Regex
Golf, which comes up with an algorithm to find a short regex that matches the
winners and not the losers from two arbitrary lists. The Python code is
readable, the process is TDDish, and the problem, which sounds simple, but
soon explodes into regex weirdness, as does most regex code. If you find
regular expressions confusing you'll definitely benefit from Peter's
deliberate strategy for finding a regex.The post demonstrating the iterated
improvement of the program is atxkcd 1313: Regex Golf (Part 2: Infinite
Problems). As with most first solutions it wasn't optimal. To improve the
program Peter recommends the following steps: Profiling: Figure out where the
program spends its time. Speed</p><p>4 0.61743164 <a title="1295-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-05-Ask_MemSQL%3A_Anything_you_want_to_know_about_MemSQL%3F.html">1298 high scalability-2012-08-05-Ask MemSQL: Anything you want to know about MemSQL?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Guys,At one of my jobs I have to administer a CISCO ACE (application control
engine) hardware load-balancer.I don't particularly love this beast, but it's
very very powerful.There appears to be little real-world info out there, so it
could be interesting writing an article on that.But I don't have other HW LB's
to compare it to and I don't want to rehash the product page.What would
interest you in a 'product review' of a loadbalancer?No replies means it's not
an interesting topic, so no article then ;-)</p><p>3 0.47164559 <a title="1295-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-22-Exploring_the_software_behind_Facebook%2C_the_world%E2%80%99s_largest_site.html">845 high scalability-2010-06-22-Exploring the software behind Facebook, the world’s largest site</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Peter Alguacil at Pingdom wrote a HighScalability worthy article on Facebook's
architecture: Exploring the software behind Facebook, the world's largest
site. It covers the challenges Facebook faces, the software Facebook uses, and
the techniques Facebook uses to keep on scaling. Definitely worth a look.</p><p>4 0.39464724 <a title="1295-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-28-Product%3A_ISPMan_Centralized_ISP_Management_System_.html">228 high scalability-2008-01-28-Product: ISPMan Centralized ISP Management System </a></p>
<p>Introduction: FromFRESH Portsand their website:ISPmanis an ISP management software written
in perl, using an LDAPbackend to manage virtual hosts for an ISP. It can be
used to manage,DNS, virtual hosts for apache config, postfix configuration,
cyrusmail boxes, proftpd etc.ISPMan was written as a management tool for the
network at 4unet wherebetween 30 to 50 domains are hosted and the number is
crazily growing.Managing these domains and their users was a little time
consuming,and needed an Administrator who knows linux and these
daemonsfluently. Now the help-desk can easily manage the domains and
users.LDAP data can be easily replicated site wide, and mail box server canbe
scaled from 1 to n as required. An LDAP entry called maildroptells the SMTP
server (postfix) where to deliver the mail. The SMTPservers can be
loadbalanced with one of many load balancingtechniques. The program is written
with scalability and Highavailability in mind.This may not be the right
software for you if you want to run a sm</p><p>5 0.39304066 <a title="1295-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-28-Product%3A_Web_Log_Expert.html">36 high scalability-2007-07-28-Product: Web Log Expert</a></p>
<p>Introduction: WebLog Expertis a fast and powerful access log analyzer. It will give you
information about your site's visitors: activity statistics, accessed files,
paths through the site, information about referring pages, search engines,
browsers, operating systems, and more. The program produces easy-to-read HTML
reports that include both text information (tables) and charts. View the
WebLog Expert sample report to get the general idea of the variety of
information about your site's usage it can provide.WebLog Expert can analyze
logs of Apache and IIS web servers. It can even read GZ and ZIP compressed
logs so you won't need to unpack them manually.The log analyzer features
intuitive interface. Built-in wizards will help you quickly and easily create
a profile for your site and analyze it.</p><p>6 0.34968227 <a title="1295-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-15-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_15%2C_2012.html">1265 high scalability-2012-06-15-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 15, 2012</a></p>

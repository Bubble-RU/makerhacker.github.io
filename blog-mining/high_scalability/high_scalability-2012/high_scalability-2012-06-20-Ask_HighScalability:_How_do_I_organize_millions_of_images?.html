<p>Introduction: Hi,First of all I want to to say that this is an extremely interesting and
informative website. i have enjoyed reading the various posts on how the big
sites scale to meet the needs of their customers.The service we are developing
is a webcam service. The client application sends images to the server via
HTTP POST and they are saved in folder specified by the users id. When a new
image is sent to the server it will overwrite the current image.Users can then
view the images via our web server.Ideally we want the images to upload as
quickly as possible and allow users to view them as quickly as possible.Would
I be correct to assume that when the number of uploading clients exceeds the
capability of the server the only way to scale is to add more hardware.Also I
assume that to use HTTP accelerator caches will not speed up viewing the
images as the new images will invalidate the cache.I appreciate any input on
the subject.</p><p>3 0.15079604 <a title="1268-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-10-mixi.jp__Architecture.html">5 high scalability-2007-07-10-mixi.jp  Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is whatMike Peters says he can do: make your site run 10 times faster.
His test bed is "half a dozen servers parsing 200,000 pages per hour over 40
IP addresses, 24 hours a day." Before optimization CPU spiked to 90% with 50
concurrent connections. After optimization each machine "was effectively
handling 500 concurrent connections per second with CPU at 8% and no
degradation in performance."Mike identifies six major bottlenecks:Database
write access (read is cheaper)Database read accessPHP, ASP, JSP and any other
server side scriptingClient side JavaScriptMultiple/Fat Images, scripts or css
files from different domains on your pageSlow keep-alive client connections,
clogging your available socketsMike's solutions:breakSwitch all database
writes to offline processingMinimize number of database read access to the
bare minimum. No more than two queries per page.Denormalize your database and

<p>Introduction: Our company offers a web service that is provided to users from several
different hosting centers across the globe.The content and functionality at
each of the servers is almost exactly the same, and we could have based them
all in a single location. However, we chose to distribute the servers
geographically to offer our users the best performance, regardless where they
might be.Up until now, the only content on the servers that has had to be
synchronized is the server software itself. The features and functionality of
our service are being updated regularly, so every week or two we push updates
out to all the servers at basically the same time. We use a relatively manual
approach to do the updating, but it works fine.Sometime soon, however, our
synchronization needs are going to get a bit more complex.In particular, we'll
soon start offering a feature at our site that will involve a database with
content that will change on an almost second-by-second basis, based on user
input and act</p><p>4 0.68749684 <a title="1268-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-19-A_Short_On_How_the_Wayback_Machine_Stores_More_Pages_than_Stars_in_the_Milky_Way.html">1650 high scalability-2014-05-19-A Short On How the Wayback Machine Stores More Pages than Stars in the Milky Way</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How does the Wayback Machinework? Now with over 400 billion webpages indexed,
allowing the Internet to be browsed all the way back to 1996, it's an even
more compelling question. I've looked several times but I've never found a
really good answer.Here's some information from a thread on Hacker News. It
starts with mmagin, a former Archive employee:I can't speak to their current
infrastructure (though more of it is open source now - http://archive-
access.sourceforge.net/projects/wayback/ ), but as far as the wayback machine,
there was no SQL database anywhere in it.For the purposes of making the
wayback machine go:Archived data was in ARC file format (predecessor to
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_ARChive) which is essentially a concatenation
of separately gzipped records. That is, you can seek to a particular offset
and start decompressing a record. Thus you could get at any archived web page
with a triple (server, filename, file-offset) Thus it was spread across a lot

<p>Introduction: Does anyone have any advice or suggestions on how to store millions of images?
Currently images are stored in a MS SQL database which performance wise isn't
ideal. We'd like to migrate the images over to a file system structure but I'd
assume we don't just want to dump millions of images into a single directory.
Besides having to contend with naming collisions, the windows filesystem might
not perform optimally with that many files.I'm assuming one approach may be to
assign each user a unique CSLID, create a folder based on the CSLID and then
place one users files in that particular folder. Even so, this could result in
hundreds of thousands of folders. Whats the best organizational
scheme/heirachy for doing this?</p><p>3 0.63399714 <a title="1268-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-01-8_Commonly_Used_Scalable_System_Design_Patterns.html">951 high scalability-2010-12-01-8 Commonly Used Scalable System Design Patterns</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ricky HoinScalable System Design Patternshas created a great list of
scalability patterns along with very well done explanatory graphics. A summary
of the patterns are:Load Balancer- a dispatcher determines which worker
instance will handle a request based on different policies.Scatter and Gather-
a dispatcher multicasts requests to all workers in a pool. Each worker will
compute a local result and send it back to the dispatcher, who will
consolidate them into a single response and then send back to the
client.Result Cache- a dispatcher will first lookup if the request has been
made before and try to find the previous result to return, in order to save
the actual execution.Shared Space- all workers monitors information from the
shared space and contributes partial knowledge back to the blackboard. The
information is continuously enriched until a solution is reached.Pipe and
Filter- all workers connected by pipes across which data flows.MapReduce-
targets batch jobs where disk I/O is th</p><p>4 0.58805847 <a title="1268-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-11-Classifying_XTP_systems_and_how_cloud_changes_which_type_startups_will_use.html">531 high scalability-2009-03-11-Classifying XTP systems and how cloud changes which type startups will use</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It looks like in the near future I'll have a chance to interview the Elastra
CEO. Elastra provides standarddatabases--MySQL, EnterpriseDB and PostgreSQL--
on top of EC2 and S3. They are selling aggressive pricing, expandable and
contactable database resource usage in response to demand, and a simple
management and operations interface to well known databases deployed in a
cloud. Elastra could be an important option for developers looking for a more
traditional cloudy database.I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions
for questions you would like answered? What would you like to know about their
service? What are you looking for in a cloudy database? What would stop you
from adopting it or what would make you decide to adopt it? Any ideas you have
would help a lot and will probably be better than anything I have.</p><p>6 0.54087842 <a title="1268-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-19-High_Definition_Video_Delivery_on_the_Web%3F.html">447 high scalability-2008-11-19-High Definition Video Delivery on the Web?</a></p>

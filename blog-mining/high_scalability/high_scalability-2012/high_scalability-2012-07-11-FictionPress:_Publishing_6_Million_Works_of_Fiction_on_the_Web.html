</p><p>5 In addition, it needs the ability to index them with minimal impact to resource costs and performance. [sent-13, score-0.15]
</p><p>6 "The only way to make this all work and provide a good customer experience is to guarantee that we can deliver a flat predictable performance with our database back-end even as the number of rows crosses the 100 million mark," according to Li. [sent-14, score-0.497]
</p><p>7 FictionPress considered InnoDB, the default storage engine for MySQL, but it did not offer predictable performance at scale. [sent-15, score-0.211]
</p><p>8 Indexes became dramatically slower as the number of rows increased, causing a reduction of both read and write performance. [sent-16, score-0.123]
</p><p>9 InnoDB also did not offer the performance-enhancing feature of multiple clustering indexes. [sent-17, score-0.13]

<p>Introduction: We're implementing a website which should be oriented to content and with
massive access by public and we would need a search engine to index and
execute queries on the indexes of contents (stored in a database, most likely
MySQL InnoDB or Oracle).The solution we found is to implement a separate
service to make index constantly the contents of the database at regular
intervals. Anyway, this is a complex and not optimal solution, since we would
like it to index in real time and make it searchable.Could you point me to
some examples or articles I could review to design asolution for such this

which they try to answer critics by going into more depth about their
technology.MemSQL ruffled a few feathers with their claim of being the fastest
database in the world. According to their benchmarks MemSQL can execute 200K

million transactions a second.Benchmarks are always a dark mirror, so make of
them what you will, but the target market for MemSQL is clear: projects
looking for something both fast and familiar. Fast as in a novel design using
a combination of technologies likeMVCC, code generation,lock-free data
structures,skip lists, andin-memory execution. Familiar as in SQL and nothing
but SQL. The only interface to MemSQL is SQL.It's right to point out MemSQL
gets a boost by being a first release. Only a limited subset of SQL is

<p>Introduction: Wordnik is an online dictionary and language resource that has both a website
and an API component. Their goal is toshow you as much information as
possible, as fast as we can find it, for every word in English, and to give
you a place where you can make your own opinions about words known.As cool as
that is, what is really cool is the information they share in theirblogabout
their experiences building a web service. They've written an excellent series
of articles and presentations you may find useful:What has technology doSave &

model they can do work in parallel andwe count as many words as possible when
we can, and add them all up when there's a lag. The count's always in the

<p>Introduction: Data mining and fast queries are always in that bin of hard to do things where
doing something smarter can yield big results. Bloom Filters are one such do
it smarter strategy, compressed bitmap indexes are another. In one application
"FastBit outruns other search indexes by a factor of 10 to 100 and doesn't
require much more room than the original data size." The data size is an
interesting metric. Our old standard b-trees can be two to four times larger
than the original data. In a test searching an Enron email database FastBit
outran MySQL by 10 to 1,000 times.FastBit is a software tool for searching
large read-only datasets. It organizes user data in a column-oriented
structure which is efficient for on-line analytical processing (OLAP), and
utilizes compressed bitmap indices to further speed up query processing.
Analyses have proven the compressed bitmap index used in FastBit to be
theoretically optimal for one-dimensional queries. Compared with other optimal
indexing methods, bit</p><p>5 0.73613614 <a title="1281-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-28-Sean_Hull%27s_20_Biggest_Bottlenecks_that_Reduce_and_Slow_Down_Scalability.html">1508 high scalability-2013-08-28-Sean Hull's 20 Biggest Bottlenecks that Reduce and Slow Down Scalability</a></p>

cached in memory, the database still has to write it to disk. MySQL binary
logs or Oracle redo logs fit the bill.With a MySQL cluster or distributed file
system such as DRBD (Distributed Replicated Block Device) or Amazon Multi-AZ
(Multi-Availability Zone), a commit occurs not only locally, but also at the
remote end. A two-phase commit means waiting for an acknowledgment from the
far end. Because of network and other latency, those commits can be slowed
down by milliseconds, as though all the cars on a highway were slowed down by
heavy loa</p><p>6 0.72860724 <a title="1281-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-25-The_Anatomy_of_Search_Technology%3A_blekko%E2%80%99s_NoSQL_database.html">1233 high scalability-2012-04-25-The Anatomy of Search Technology: blekko’s NoSQL database</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This question comes from Ulysses on aninteresting threadfrom the Mechanical
Sympathy news group, especially given how multiple processors are now the
norm:Ulysses:On an 8xCPU Linux instance,  is it at all advantageous to use the
Linux taskset command to pin an 8xJVM process set (co-ordinated as a
www.infinispan.org distributed cache/data grid) to a specific CPU affinity set
(i.e. pin JVM0 process to CPU 0, JVM1 process to CPU1, ...., JVM7process to
CPU 7) vs. just letting the Linux OS use its default mechanism for
provisioning the 8xJVM process set to the available CPUs?In effrort to seek an
optimal point (in the full event space), what are the conceptual trade-offs in
considering "searching" each permutation of provisioning an 8xJVM process set
to an 8xCPU set via taskset?Giventaskset is they key to the question, it would
help to have a definition:Used to set or retrieve the CPU affinity of a
running process given its PID or to launch a new COMMAND with a given CPU
affinity.

<p>Introduction: Debugging complex problems is 90% persistence and 50% cool tools. Brendan
Gregg in10 Performance Wins tells a fascinating story of how a team at Joyent
solved some weird and challenging performance issues deep in the OS. It took
lots of effort,DTrace, Flame Graphs,USE Method, and writing custom tools when
necessary. Here's a quick summary of the solved cases:Monitoring. 1000x
improvement. An application blocked while paging anonymous memory back in. It
was also blocked during file system fsync() calls. The application was
misconfigured and sometimes briefly exceeded available memory, getting page
out.Riak. 2x improvement. The Erlang VM used half the CPU count it was
supposed to, so CPUs remained unused.  Fix was a configuration change.MySQL.
380x improvement. Reads were slow. Cause was correlated writes. Fix was to
tune the cache flush interval on the storage controller.Various. 2800x
improvement. Large systems calls to getvmusage() could take a few seconds.

<p>Introduction: Stardog makes a commercial graph database that is a great example of what can
be accomplished with a scale-up strategy on BigIron. In a recent article
StarDog described how they made their new 2.1 release insanely scalable,
improving query scalability by about 3 orders of magnitude and it can now
handle 50 billion triples on a $10,000 server with 32 cores and 256 GB RAM. It
can also load 20B datasets at 300,000 triples per second. What did they do
that you can also do?Avoid locks by using non-blocking algorithms and data
structures. For example, moving from BitSet to ConcurrentLinkedQueue.Use
ThreadLocal aggressively to reduce thread contention and avoid
synchronization.Batch LRU evictions in a single thread. Triggered by several
LRU caches becoming problematic when evictions were being swamped by
additions. Downside is batching increases memory pressure and GC times.Move to
SHA1 for hashing URIs, bnodes, and literal values. Making hash collisions
nearly impossible enable significant s</p><p>same-blog 4 0.91366625 <a title="1281-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-11-FictionPress%3A_Publishing_6_Million_Works_of_Fiction_on_the_Web.html">1281 high scalability-2012-07-11-FictionPress: Publishing 6 Million Works of Fiction on the Web</a></p>
<p>Introduction: FictionPress operates both FictionPress.com and FanFiction.net and is home to
over 6 million works of fiction, with millions of writers/readers
participating from around the world in over 30 languages.Issues
addressed:Support complex and efficient indexes at 100+ million
rows.Predicable and consistent performance regardless of data size growth.Fast
recovery.Ensuring Predictable Performance at ScaleThe Challenge:FictionPress
offers a number of interactive features to its large user base. These include
discussion forums, in-site messaging and user reviews. FictionPress made the
decision to build its own discussion forums to meet its strict security and
performance requirements. Xing Li, CTO of FictionPress, noted that the site
"needs to host hundreds of thousands of forums. Existing forum software
doesn't do this while meeting our performance and security targets."To ensure
the real-time responsiveness of the forums, FictionPress needs the ability to

<p>Introduction: Martin Thompson wrote a really interestingarticleon the beneficial performance
impact of taking advantage of Processor Affinity:The interesting thing I've
observed is that the unpinned test will follow a step function of
unpredictable performance.  Across many runs I've seen different patterns but
all similar in this step function nature.  For the pinned tests I get
consistent throughput with no step pattern and always the greatest
throughput.The idea is by assigning a thread to a particular CPU that when a
thread is rescheduled to run on the same CPU, it can take advantage of the
"accumulated  state in the processor, including instructions and data in the
cache."  With multi-core chips the norm now, you may want to decide for
yourself how to assign work to cores and not let the OS do it for you. The
results are surprisingly strong.</p><p>6 0.90861917 <a title="1281-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-16-Scalable_Web_Architectures_and_Application_State.html">656 high scalability-2009-07-16-Scalable Web Architectures and Application State</a></p>

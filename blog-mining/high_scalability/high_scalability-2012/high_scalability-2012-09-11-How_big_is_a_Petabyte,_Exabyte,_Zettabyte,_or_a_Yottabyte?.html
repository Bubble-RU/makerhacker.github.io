<p>Introduction: A software-based distributed caching system such as memcached is an important
piece of today's largest Internet sites that support millions of concurrent
users and deliver user-friendly response times. The distributed nature of
memcached design transforms 1000s of servers into one large caching pool with
gigabytes of memory per node. This blog entry explores single-instance
memcached scalability for a few usage patterns.Table below shows out-of-the-

<p>Introduction: How Big is a Yottabyte? Not so big that the NSA can't hope to store it
saysCrunchGear: There are a thousand gigabytes in a terabyte, a thousand
terabytes in a petabyte, a thousand petabytes in an exabyte, a thousand
exabytes in a zettabyte, and a thousand zettabytes in a yottabyte. In other
words, a yottabyte is 1,000,000,000,000,000GB.The CMS data aggregation system.
The Large Hadron Collider project is usingMongoDB as a cache.Here we discuss a
new data aggregation system which consumes, indexes and delivers information
from different relational and non-relational data sources to answer cross
data-service queries and explore meta-data associated with petabytes of
experimental data.Google I/O 2010 Videosare up available (many of them

<p>Introduction: Raymond Blumleads a team of Site Reliability Engineers charged with keeping
Google's data secret and keeping it safe. Of course Google would never say how
much data this actually is, but from comments it seems that it is not yet
ayottabyte, but is manyexabytesin size. GMail alone is approaching low
exabytes of data.Mr. Blum, in the video How Google Backs Up the Internet,
explained common backup strategies don't work for Google for a very googly
sounding reason: typically theyscale effort with capacity. If backing up twice
as much data requires twice as much stuff to do it, where stuff is time,
energy, space, etc., it won't work, it doesn't scale.  You have to find
efficiencies so that capacity can scale faster than the effort needed to
support that capacity. A different plan is needed when making the jump from
backing up one exabyte to backing up two exabytes. And the talk is largely
about how Google makes that happen.Some major themes of the talk:No data loss,
ever. Even the infamous</p><p>5 0.088941462 <a title="1320-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-18-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_18%2C_2011.html">992 high scalability-2011-02-18-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 18, 2011</a></p>

compute the answer.Answer Engine vs Search EngineWhenWolfram|Alphalaunches
later today, it will beone of the most computationally intensive websites on
the internet. TheWolfram|Alpha computational knowledge engineis an "answer

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectivesis a series of posts that highlights the ideas that
will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires
an open mind. Warning #2: this post is wild.Kevin KellyKevin Kelly is Senior
Maverick at Wired magazine. He helped launch Wired in 1993, and served as its
Executive Editor until January 1999. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers'
Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online
service started in 1985. He authored the best-sellingNew Rules for the New
Economyand the classic book on decentralized emergent systems,Out of

<p>Introduction: Although the problem of scaling human genome sequencing is not exactly about
building bigger, faster and more reliable websites it is most interesting in
terms of scalability. Thepaperdescribes a new technology by the startup
company Complete Genomics to sequence the full human genome for the fraction
of the cost of earlier possibilities.Complete Genomics is building the world's
largest commercial human genome sequencing center to provide turnkey,
outsourced complete human genome sequencing to customers worldwide.By 2010,
their data center will contain approximately 60,000 processors with 30
petabytes of storage running their sequencing software on Linux clusters.Do
you find this interesting and relevant to HighScalability.com?</p><p>5 0.63786465 <a title="1320-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-01-PRISM%3A_The_Amazingly_Low_Cost_of_%C2%ADUsing_BigData_to_Know_More_About_You_in_Under_a_Minute.html">1485 high scalability-2013-07-01-PRISM: The Amazingly Low Cost of ­Using BigData to Know More About You in Under a Minute</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by BugSense Founder/CTO Jon Vlachogiannisand Head of
Infrastructure at BugSensePanagiotis Papadomitsos.There has been a lot of
speculation and assumptions around whetherPRISMexists and if it is cost
effective. I don't know whether it exists or not, but I can tell you if it
could be built.Short answer: It can.If you believe it would be impossible for
someone with access to a social "datapool" to find out more about you (if they
really want to track you down) in the tsunami of data, you need to think
again.Devices, apps and websites are transmitting data. Lots of data. The
questions are could the data compiled and searched and how costly would it be
to search for your targeted data. (hint: It is not $4.56 trillion).Let's
experiment and try to build PRISM by ourselves with a few
assumptions:Assumption 1: We have all the appropriate "data connectors" that
will provide us with data.Assumption 2: These connectors provide direct access
to social networks, emails, mobile t</p><p>6 0.63706857 <a title="1320-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-03-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_3rd%2C_2014.html">1572 high scalability-2014-01-03-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 3rd, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's trendy today to say "I don't read blogs anymore, I just let the random
chance of my social network guide me to new and interesting content." #fail.
While someone says this I imagine them flicking their hair back in a "I can't
be bothered with true understanding" disdain. And where does random chance get
its content? From people like these. So:support your local blog!If you would
like to be a part of random chance, here are a few new podcasts/blogs/vidcasts
that you may not know about and that I've found interesting:DevOps Cafe. With

<p>Introduction: Lustre速is a scalable, secure, robust, highly-available cluster file system. It
is designed, developed and maintained by Cluster File Systems, Inc.The central
goal is the development of a next-generation cluster file system which can
serve clusters with 10,000's of nodes, provide petabytes of storage, and move
100's of GB/sec with state-of-the-art security and management
infrastructure.Lustre runs on many of the largest Linux clusters in the world,
and is included by CFS's partners as a core component of their cluster
offering (examples include HP StorageWorks SFS, and the Cray XT3 and XD1
supercomputers). Today's users have also demonstrated that Lustre scales down
as well as it scales up, and runs in production on clusters as small as 4 and
as large as 25,000 nodes.The latest version of Lustre is always available from
Cluster File Systems, Inc. Public Open Source releases of Lustre are available
under the GNU General Public License. These releases are found here, and are

<p>Introduction: An interesting and different implementation approach: Tempest: Scalable Time-
Critical Web Services Platform: Tempest is a new framework for developing
time-critical web services. Tempest enables developers to build scalable,
fault-tolerant services that can then be automatically replicated and deployed
across clusters of computing nodes. The platform automatically adapts to load
ďŹ&sbquo;uctuations, reacts when components fail, and ensures consistency between
replicas by repairing when inconsistencies do occur. Tempest relies on a
family of epidemic protocols and on Ricochet, a reliable time critical
multicast protocol with probabilistic guarantees.Tempest is built around a
novel storage abstraction called the TempestCollection in which application
developers store the state of a service. Our platform handles the replication
of this state across clones of the service, persistence, and failure handling.

developer, th</p><p>6 0.53285849 <a title="1320-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-10-The_technology_behind_Tornado%2C_FriendFeed%27s_web_server.html">700 high scalability-2009-09-10-The technology behind Tornado, FriendFeed's web server</a></p>

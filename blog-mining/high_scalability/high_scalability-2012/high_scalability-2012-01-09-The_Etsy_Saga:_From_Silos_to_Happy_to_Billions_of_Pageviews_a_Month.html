</p><p>3 Conway's Law: When a team makes a product the product ends up resembling the team that made it. [sent-19, score-0.132]
</p><p>4 To fix their scalability problems they created middleware layer called Sprouter - Stored procedure router. [sent-23, score-0.177]
</p><p>5 Sprouter was still a silo architecture, which resembled the team that they had. [sent-30, score-0.215]
</p><p>6 Created a lot of developer friction as DBAs were on the hook for all database work which is a huge schedule dependency. [sent-31, score-0.125]
</p><p>7 Made deploys worse because Sprouter cached stored procedure identifiers, which were invalid during an upgrade. [sent-36, score-0.353]

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: Aditya Agarwal, Director of Engineering at Facebook, gave an excellent Scale
at Facebooktalk that covers their architecture, but the talk is really more
about how to scale an organization by preserving the best parts of its
culture. The key take home of the talk is: You can get the code right, you can
get the products right, but you need to get the culture right first. If you
don't get the culture right then your company won't scale.This leads into the
four meta secrets of scaling at Facebook:Scaling takes IterationDon't Over
DesignChoose the right tool for the job, but realize that your choice comes
with overhead.Get the culture right. Move Fast \- break things. Huge Impact \-
small teams. Be bold \- innovate.Some Background Facebook is big: 400 million
active users; users spend an average of 20 minutes a day; 5 billion pieces of
content (status updates, comments, likes, photo uploads, video uploads, chat

<p>Introduction: We can all learn from problems. The Google App Engine team has created a
teachable moment through a remarkably honest and forthcomingpost-mortem for
February 24th, 2010 outagepost, chronicling in elaborate detail a power outage
that took down Google App Engine for a few hours.The world is ending! The
cloud is unreliable! Jump ship! Not. This is not evidence that the cloud is a
beautiful, powerful and unsinkable ship that goes down on its maiden voyage.
Stuff happens, no matter how well you prepare. If you think private
datacenters don't go down, well, then I have some rearangeable deck chairs to
sell you. The goal is to keep improving and minimizing those failure windows.
From that perspective there is a lot to learn from the problems the Google App
Engine team encountered and how they plan to fix them.Please read the article
for all the juicy details, but here's what struck me as key:Power fails. Plan
for it. This seems to happen with unexpected frequency for such expensive and

<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble wrote a fascinating case study,MySpace's death spiral: insiders
say it's due to bets on Los Angeles and Microsoft, where he reports MySpace
insiders blame the Microsoft stack on why theylost the great social network
raceto Facebook.  Does anyone know if this is true? What's the real story?I
was wondering because it doesn't seem to track with theMySpace Architecture
post that I did in 2009, where they seem happy with their choices and had
stats to back up their improvements. Why this matters is it's a fascinating
model for startups to learn from. What does it really take to succeed? Is it
the people or the stack? Is it the organization or the technology? Is it the
process or the competition? Is the quality of the site or the love of the
users? So much to consider and learn from.Some conjectures from the
article:Myspace didn't have programming talent capable of scaling the site to
compete with Facebook.Choosing the Microsoft stack made it difficult to hire

<p>Introduction: Recently I had to help users on one of my opensource project ISPMan.
http://ispman.netThis project started in 2001 as I was too unwilling to take
care of the DNS and VitualHosting stuff as it was a side-thing to the company
I worked for (so i wrote a software that took care of all these little
details)Summary: A large project that needs a rewrite can be done in a matter
of day.I will not give you a full case study about a project that went through
a re-write but a case study about how easy it is to re-write
something.breakDetails:My boss was cool enough to let me open-source the
project and obviously, I got a lot of cool-cred out of it.Later on I also did
some support and implementation and earned quiet some money with it.Eventually
I had to let the project go out of my hand to the community as I only did it
to facilitate a job that wasnt williing to do. (Setup DNS zones of multiple

<p>Introduction: The fascination over Instagram continues and fortunately we have several new
streams of information to feed the insanity. So consider this article an
update toThe Instagram Architecture Facebook Bought For A Cool Billion
Dollars, based primarily onScaling Instagram, a slide deck for an AirBnB tech
talk given by Instagram co-founder, Mike Krieger. Several other information
sources, listed at the bottom of the article, were also used.Unfortunately we
just have a slide deck, so the connective tissue of the talk is missing, but
it's still very interesting, in the same spirit of wisdom presentations we

disappointed. That magic can be found in the emotional investment in the

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Rodrigo Guzman, CTO ofiDoneThis, which makes status
reporting happen at your company with the lightest possible touch.iDoneThisis
a simple management application that emails your team at the end of every day
to ask, "What'd you get done today?" Just reply with a few lines of what you
got done. The following morning everyone on your team gets a digest with what
the team accomplished the previous day to keep everyone in the loop and
kickstart another awesome day.Before we launched, we built iDoneThis over a
weekend in the most rudimentary way possible. I kid you not, we sent the first
few batches of daily emails using the BCC field of a Gmail inbox. The upshot
is that we've had users on the site from Day 3 of its existence on.We've gone
from launch in January 2011 when we sent hundreds of emails out per day by
hand to sending out over 1 million emails and handling over 200,000 incoming
emails per month. In total, customers have recorded over 1.7 million

<p>Introduction: Under the philosophy thatthe best method to analyse spam is to become a
spammer, this absolutely fascinating paper recounts how a team of UC Berkely
researchers went under cover to infiltrate a spam network. Part CSI, part
Mission Impossible, and part MacGyver, the team hijacked the botnet so that
their code was actually part of the dark network itself. Once inside they
figured out the architecture and protocols of the botnet and how many sales
they were able to tally. Truly elegant work.Two different spam campaigns were
run on aStormbotnet network of 75,800 zombie computers. Storm is a peer-to-
peer botnet that uses spam to creep its tentacles through the world wide
computer network. One of the campains distributed viruses in order to recruit
new bots into the network. This is normally accomplished by enticing people to
download email attachments. An astonishing one in ten people downloaded the
executable and ran it, which means we won't run out of zombies soon. The

<p>Introduction: Seldom do we get to hear stories of the bumps and bruses earned by a popular
website during its formative years. Ross Snyder, a Sr. Software Engineer at
Etsy, changes that with an engaging talk he gave at Surge 2011:Scaling Etsy:
What Went Wrong, What Went Right.Ross gives a detailed and honest account of
how Etsy went from a raw startup in 2005, to a startup struggling with their
success in 2007, to the mean, handmade, super scaling, ops driven machine
they've become in 2011.There's lots to learn from this illuminating story of

<p>Introduction: Update :  A very nice JavaWorld podcast interview with  Google engineer Max Ross on Hibernate Shards . Max defines Hibernate Shards (horizontal partitioning), how it works (pretty well), virtual shards (don't ask), what they need to do in the future (query, replication, operational tools), and how it relates to Google AppEngine (not much).   To scale you are supposed to partition your data. Sounds good, but how do you do it? When you actually sit down to work out all the details it’s not that easy. Hibernate Shards to the rescue! Hibernate shards is: an extension to the core Hibernate product that adds facilities for horizontal partitioning. If you know the core Hibernate API you know the shards API. No learning curve at all. Here is what a few members of the core group had to say about the Hibernate Shards open source project. Although there are some limitations, from the sound of it they are doing useful stuff in the right way and it’s very much worth looking at, especially if you us</p><p>3 0.066738956 <a title="1336-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-24-Product%3A__Hibernate_Shards.html">24 high scalability-2007-07-24-Product:  Hibernate Shards</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you want to adopt a shard architecture, but don't want to start from scratch, you may want to consider Hibernate's sharding system.
 
Hibernate Shards is a framework that is designed to encapsulate and minimize this complexity by adding support for horizontal partitioning to Hibernate Core.   Hibernate Shards  key features:
  
  Standard Hibernate programming model - Hibernate Shards allows you to continue using the Hibernate APIs you know and love: SessionFactory, Session, Criteria, Query. If you already know how to use Hibernate, you already know how to use Hibernate Shards. 
  Flexible sharding strategies - Distribute data across your shards any way you want. Use one of the default strategies we provide or plug in your own application-specific logic. 
  Support for virtual shards - Think your sharding strategy is never going to change? Think again. Adding new shards and redistributing your data is one of the toughest operational challenges you will face once you've deployed your</p><p>4 0.054642685 <a title="1336-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-07-Startups_are_Creating_a_New_System_of_the_World_for_IT.html">1240 high scalability-2012-05-07-Startups are Creating a New System of the World for IT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear? For years startups, like the frenetically inventive</p><p>5 0.054406803 <a title="1336-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.

<p>Introduction: Let me begin by saying that I have used and continue to use various ORM frameworks such as hibernate, ibatis, propel and activerecord in applications and websites that have a user base ranging from a couple hundred to 500k users.  Especially for projects that have to be up and running in a short duration of time, ORM frameworks significantly reduce the effort required to manipulate and persist OOP objects by providing time saving facilities such as automatically generated model objects, integrated unit testing,  secure variable substitution, etc. Hibernate even supports horizontal  data partitioning via Hibernate Shards.      However, the lay of the land is significantly different in the rarefied space occupied by applications needing to support millions of users. Profiling an application at this level and paying particular attention to the operations needed to move data to and from the database, it becomes evident that a significant portion of the operations are API related, whereby t</p><p>4 0.71629256 <a title="1336-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-27-TripAdvisor_Architecture_-_40M_Visitors%2C_200M_Dynamic_Page_Views%2C_30TB_Data.html">1068 high scalability-2011-06-27-TripAdvisor Architecture - 40M Visitors, 200M Dynamic Page Views, 30TB Data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Andy Gelfond , VP of Engineering for TripAdvisor. Andy has been with TripAdvisor for six and a half years, wrote a lot of code in the earlier days, and has been building and running a first class engineering and operations team that is responsible for the worlds largest travel site. There's an update for this article at  An Epic TripAdvisor Update: Why Not Run On The Cloud? The Grand Experiment .  
 
For  TripAdvisor , scalability is woven into our organization on many levels - data center, software architecture, development/deployment/operations, and, most importantly, within the culture and organization. It is not enough to have a scalable data center, or a scalable software architecture. The process of designing, coding, testing, and deploying code also needs to be scalable. All of this starts with hiring and a culture and an organization that values and supports a distributed, fast, and effective development and operation of a complex and highly scalable co</p><p>5 0.7084986 <a title="1336-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-11-Troubleshooting_response_time_problems_%E2%80%93_why_you_cannot_trust_your_system_metrics.html">1038 high scalability-2011-05-11-Troubleshooting response time problems – why you cannot trust your system metrics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Production Monitoring  is about ensuring the stability and health of our system, that also  includes the application. A lot of times we encounter production systems  that concentrate on System Monitoring, under the assumption that a  stable system leads to stable and healthy applications. So let’s see  what System Monitoring can tell us about our  Application .
 
Let’s take a very simple two tier Web Application:
        
This is a simple multi-tier eCommerce solution. Users are concerned  about bad performance when they do a search. Let's see what we can find  out about it if performance is not satisfactory. We start by looking at a  couple of simple metrics.
  CPU Utilization  
The best known operating system metric is CPU utilization, but it is  also the most misunderstood. This metric tells us how much time the CPU  spent executing code in the last interval and how much more it could  execute theoretically. Like all other utilization measures it tells us  something about the capaci</p><p>6 0.70675093 <a title="1336-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-28-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_28th%2C_2014.html">1621 high scalability-2014-03-28-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 28th, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Yes, I just got through watching the Superbowl so chips and salsa are on my mind and in my stomach. In recreational eating more chips requires downing more salsa. With mulitcore chips it turns out as cores go up salsa goes down, salsa obviously being a metaphor for speed.     Sandia National Laboratories found in their simulations:   a significant increase in speed going from two to four multicores, but an insignificant increase from four to eight multicores. Exceeding eight multicores causes a decrease in speed. Sixteen multicores perform barely as well as two, and after that, a steep decline is registered as more cores are added. The problem is the lack of memory bandwidth as well as contention between processors over the memory bus available to each processor.      The implication for those following a diagonal scaling strategy is to work like heck to make your system fit within eight multicores. After that you'll need to consider some sort of partitioning strategy.

I loved the JPA 1.0 back in early 2000s. I started using it together with EJB 3.0 even before the stable releases. I loved it so much that I contributed bits and parts for JBoss 3.x implementations.
  Those were the days our company was considerably still small in size. Creating new features and applications were more priority than the performance, because there were a lot of ideas that we have and we needed to develop and market those as fast as we can. Now, we no longer needed to write tedious and error prone xml descriptions for the data model and deployment descriptors. Nor we needed to use the curse called “XDoclet”.  On the other side, our company grew steadily, our web site has become the top portal in the country for live events and ticketing. We now had the performance problems! Although the company grew considerably, due to the economics in the industry, we did not make a lot of money.

<p>Introduction: Stanford Info Lab is taking pains to document a direction we've been moving for a while now, using RAM not just as a cache, but as the primary storage medium. Many  quality products  have built on this model. Even if the vision isn't radical, the paper does produce a lot of data backing up the transition, which is in itself helpful. From the The Abstract:   
 Disk-oriented approaches to online storage are becoming increasingly problematic: they do not scale grace-fully to meet the needs of large-scale Web applications, and improvements in disk capacity have far out-stripped improvements in access latency and bandwidth. This paper argues for a new approach to datacenter storage called RAMCloud, where information is kept entirely in DRAM and large-scale systems are created by aggregating the main memories of thousands of commodity servers. We believe that RAMClouds can provide durable and available storage with 100-1000x the throughput of disk-based systems and 100-1000x lower access lat</p><p>6 0.84104985 <a title="1336-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-18-Risk_Analysis_on_the_Cloud_%28Using_Excel_and_GigaSpaces%29.html">470 high scalability-2008-12-18-Risk Analysis on the Cloud (Using Excel and GigaSpaces)</a></p>

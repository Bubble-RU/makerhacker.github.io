<p>Introduction: Teams fromPrincetonand CMU areworking togetherto solve one of the most
difficult problems in the repertoire: scalable geo-distributed data stores.
Major companies like Google and Facebook have been working on multiple
datacenter database functionality for some time, but there's still a general
lack of available systems that work for complex data scenarios.The ideas in
this paper--Don't Settle for Eventual: Scalable Causal Consistency for Wide-
Area Storage with COPS--are different. It's not another eventually consistent
system, or a traditional transaction oriented system, or a replication based
system, or a system that punts on the issue. It's something new, a causally
consistent system that achievesALPSsystem properties. Move over CAP, NoSQL,
etc, we have another acronym: ALPS - Available (operations always complete
successfully), Low-latency (operations complete quickly (single digit
milliseconds)), Partition-tolerant (operates with a partition), and Scalable

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

that when you say you want to be "the Google of something"Clay Shirky: I think
one of the things that happened to the P2P market for infrastructure is that
users preference for predictable pricing vs resource-sensitive pricing is so
overwhelming that they will overpay to anyone who can promise flat prices. And
because the logic of centralization vs decentralization is so price sensitive,
I don't think there is any logical reason to assume a broadly stable class of
apps, separate from current pricing data for energy, cycles, and
storage.@chipchilders: Stop freaking making new projects just for the sake of

<p>Introduction: Someone is killing the Internet. Since you probably use the Internet everyday
you might find this surprising. It almost sounds silly, and the reason is
technical, but our crack team of networking experts has examined the patient
and made the diagnosis. What did they find?Diagnostic team: the Packet Pushers
gang (Greg Ferro,Jan Zorz,Ivan Pepelnjak) in the podcast How We Are Killing
the Internet.Diagnosis: invasive tunnelation. (tubes anyone?)Prognosis: even
Dr. House might not be able to help.Cure: go back to what the Internet was;
kill the tunnels; route IPv4 and IPv6; have public addresses on everything;
disrupt the telcos.This is a classic story in a strange setting--the network--
but the themes are universal: centralization vs. decentralization (that's
where the telcos obviously come in), good vs. evil, order vs. disorder,
tyranny vs. freedom, change vs. stasis, simplicity vs. complexity. And it's
all being carried out on battlefield few get to see: the infrastructure of

<p>Introduction: It's HighScalability Time:@davilagrau: Youtube, GitHub,..., Are cloud services
facing a entropic limit to scalability?Async all the way down? The Tyranny of
the Clock: The cost of logic and memory dominated Turing's thinking, but
today, communication rather than logic should dominate our thinking. Clock-
free design uses less than half, about 40%, as much energy per addition as its
clocked counterpart. We can regain the efficiency of local decision making by
revolting against the pervasive beat of an external clock. Why Google Compute
Engine for OpenStack. Smart move. Having OpenStack work inside a super charged
cloud, in private clouds, and as a bridge between the two ought to be quite
attractive to developers looking for some sort of ally for independence. All
it will take are a few victories to cement new alliances.3 Lessons That

<p>Introduction: This may be a bit higher level then the general discussion here, but I think
this is an important issue in how it relates to reliability and uptime. What
kind of SLAs should we be expecting from SaaS services and platforms (e.g.
AWS, Google App Engine, Google Premium Apps, salesforce.com, etc.)? Up to
today, most SaaS services either have no SLAs or offer very weak penalties.
What will it take to get these services up to the point where they can offer
the SLAs that users (and more importantly, businesses) require? I presume most
of the members here want to see more movement into the cloud and to SaaS
services, and I'm thinking that until we see more substantial SLA guarantees,
most businesses will continue to shy away as long as they can.Would love to
hear what others think. Or am I totally off base?</p><p>4 0.8461746 <a title="1344-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-30-Paper%3A_Dynamo%3A_Amazon%E2%80%99s_Highly_Available_Key-value_Store.html">139 high scalability-2007-10-30-Paper: Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2: Read/WriteWeb has a good article talking about the scalability
issues of relational databases and how Dynamo solves them:Amazon Dynamo: The
Next Generation Of Virtual Distributed Storage. But since Dynamo is just
another frustrating walled garden protected by barbed wire and guard dogs, its
relevance is somewhat overstated.Update:Greg Lindenhas a take on the paper
where he questions some of Amazon's design choices: emphasizing write
availability over fast reads, a lack of indexing support, use of random
distribution for load balancing, and punting on some scalability issues.Werner
Vogels, Amazon's avuncular CTO, just announced a newpaperon the internal
database technology Amazon uses to handle tens of millions customers. I'll
dive into more details later, but I thought you'd want to read it hot off the
blog. The bad news is it won't be a service. They are keeping this tech not so
secret, but very safe. Happily, it's another real-life example to learn from.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byGordon Worley, a Software Engineer atKorrelate, where
they correlate (see what they did there) online purchases to offline
purchases.Several weeks ago, we came into the office one morning to find every
server alarm going off. Pixel log processing was behind by 8 hours and not
making headway. Checking the logs, we discovered that a big client had come
online during the night and was giving us 10 times more traffic than we were
originally told to expect. I wouldn't say we panicked, but the office was
certainly more jittery than usual. Over the next several hours, though, thanks
both to foresight and quick thinking, we were able to scale up to handle the
added load and clear the backlog to return log processing to a steady state.At
Korrelate, we deploytracking pixels, also known beacons or web bugs, that our
partners use to send us information about their users. These tiny web objects
contain no visible content, but may include transparent 1 by 1 gifs or

<p>Introduction: This post on  Prismatic ’s Architecture is adapted from an email conversation with Prismatic programmer  Jason Wolfe  .  What should you read on the web today? Any thoroughly modern person must solve this dilemma every day, usually using some occult process to divine what’s important in their many feeds: Twitter, RSS, Facebook, Pinterest, G+, email, Techmeme, and an uncountable numbers of other information sources.  Jason Wolfe from Prismatic has generously agreed to describe their thoroughly modern solution for answering the “what to read question” using lots of sexy words like Machine Learning, Social Graphs, BigData, functional programming, and in-memory real-time feed processing. The result is possibly even more occult, but this or something very much like it will be how we meet the challenge of finding interesting topics and stories hidden inside infinitely deep pools of information.

<p>Introduction: In the never ending quest to figure out how to do something useful with never ending streams of data,  GraphLab: A New Framework For Parallel Machine Learning  wants to go beyond low-level programming, MapReduce, and dataflow languages with  a new parallel framework for ML (machine learning) which exploits the sparse structure and common computational patterns of ML algorithms. GraphLab enables ML experts to easily design and implement efﬁcient scalable parallel algorithms by composing problem speciﬁc computation, data-dependencies, and scheduling .   Our main contributions include:  
  
  A graph-based data model which simultaneously represents data and computational dependencies.   
  A set of concurrent access models which provide a range of sequential-consistency guarantees.   
  A sophisticated modular scheduling mechanism.   
  An aggregation framework to manage global state.

<p>Introduction: At some point as a programmer you might have the insight/fear that all programming is just doing stuff to other stuff.
 
Then you may observe after coding the same stuff over again that stuff in a program often takes the form of interacting patterns of flows.
 
Then you may think hey, a program isn't only useful for coding datastructures, but a program is a kind of datastructure and that with a meta level jump you could program a program in terms of flows over data and flow over other flows.
 
That's the kind of stuff Prismatic is making available in the Graph extension to their  plumbing  package ( code examples ), which is described in an excellent post:  Graph: Abstractions for Structured Computation .

<p>Introduction: This is a  guest repost  by  Rotem Hermon , former Chief Architect for  serendip.me , on the architecture and scaling considerations behind making a startup music service. 
 
 serendip.me  is a social music service that helps people discover great music shared by their friends, and also introduces them to their “music soulmates” - people outside their immediate social circle that shares a similar taste in music.
 
Serendip is running on AWS and is built on the following stack:  scala  (and some Java),  akka  (for handling concurrency),  Play framework  (for the web and API front-ends),  MongoDB  and  Elasticsearch .
  Choosing the stack  
One of the challenges of building serendip was the need to handle a large amount of data from day one, since a main feature of serendip is that it collects  every piece of music being shared on Twitter  from public music services. So when we approached the question of choosing the language and technologies to use, an important consideration was the ab</p><p>5 0.6325779 <a title="1294-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-16-Instagram_Architecture_Update%3A_What%E2%80%99s_new_with_Instagram%3F.html">1228 high scalability-2012-04-16-Instagram Architecture Update: What’s new with Instagram?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The fascination over Instagram continues and fortunately we have several new streams of information to feed the insanity. So consider this article an update to   The Instagram Architecture Facebook Bought For A Cool Billion Dollars   , based primarily on    Scaling Instagram   , a slide deck for an AirBnB tech talk given by Instagram co-founder, Mike Krieger. Several other information sources, listed at the bottom of the article, were also used.    Unfortunately we just have a slide deck, so the connective tissue of the talk is missing, but it’s still very interesting, in the same spirit of wisdom presentations we often see after developers come up for air after spending significant time spent in the trenches.     If you expect to dive deep into the technological details and find a billion reasons why Instagram was acquired, you will be disappointed. That magic can be found in the emotional investment in the relationship between all of the users and the product, not in the bits about h</p><p>6 0.63024926 <a title="1294-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-12-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_12%2C_2013.html">1490 high scalability-2013-07-12-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 12, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In update to  Prismatic Architecture - Using Machine Learning on Social Networks to Figure Out What You Should Read on the Web , Jason Wolfe, even in the face of deadening fatigue from long nights spent getting their iPhone app out, has gallantly agreed to talk a little more about Primatic's approach to Machine Learning.
 
Documents and users are two areas where Prismatic applies ML (machine learning):
  ML on Documents   
 Given an HTML document:Â         
 
 learn how to extract the main text of the page (rather than the sidebar, footer, comments, etc), its title, author, best images, etc 
 determine features for relevance (e.g., what the article is about, topics, etc.) 
 
 
 The setup for most of these tasks is pretty typical. Models are trained using big batch jobs on other machines that read data from s3, save the learned parameter files to s3, and then read (and periodically refresh) the models from s3 in the ingest pipeline.  
 All of the data that flows out of the system can be</p><p>3 0.84416699 <a title="1294-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-25-non-sequential%2C_unique_identifier%2C_strategy_question.html">606 high scalability-2009-05-25-non-sequential, unique identifier, strategy question</a></p>
<p>Introduction: (Please bare with me, I'm a new, passionate, confident and terrified programmer :D )     Background:   I'm pre-launch and 1 year into the development of my application.  My target is to be able to eventually handle millions of registered users with 5-10% of them concurrent.  Up to this point I've used auto-increment to assign unique identifiers to rows.  I am now considering switching to a non-sequential strategy.  Oh, I'm using the LAMP configuration.     My reasons for avoiding auto-increment:   1.  Complicates replication when scaling horizontally.  Risk of collision is significant (when running multiple masters).  Note: I've read the other entries in this forum that relate to ID generation and there have been some great suggestions -- including a strategy that uses auto-increment in a way that avoids this pitfall... That said, I'm still nervous about it.   2.  Potential bottleneck when retrieving/assigning IDs -- IDs assigned at the database.     My reasons for being nervous about</p><p>4 0.79291999 <a title="1294-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-14-kngine_%27Knowledge_Engine%27_milestone_2.html">630 high scalability-2009-06-14-kngine 'Knowledge Engine' milestone 2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kngine is Knowledge Web search engine designed to provide meaningful search results, such as: semantic information about the keywords/concepts, answer the user’s questions, discover the relations between the keywords/concepts, and link the different kind of data together, such as: Movies, Subtitles, Photos, Price at sale store, User reviews, and Influenced story    Goals  
Kngine long-term goal is to make all human beings systematic knowledge and experience accessible to everyone. I aim to collect and organize all objective data, and make it possible and easy to access. Our goal is to build on the advances of Web search engine, semantic web, data representation technologies a new form of Web search engine that will unleash a revolution of new possibilities.  Kngine tries to combine the power of Web search engines with the power of Semantic search and the data representation to provide meaningful search results compromising user needs.

<p>Introduction: In  Resolved: Widespread Application Outage  ,  Heroku  tells their story of how they dealt with the   Amazon outage . While taking 100% responsibility for the downtime, they also shared a number of the strategies they used to bring their service back to full working order.
 
 One of  Heroku's  most interesting strategies wasn't a technical hack at all, but how they consciously went about deploying their Ops personnel in response to the emergency. An outline of their strategy is: 
 
 
  
 Monitoring systems immediately alerted Ops to the problem.  
 An on-call engineer applied triage logic to the problem and classified it as serious, which caused the on-call  Incident Commander  to be woken out of restful slumber.  
  The  IC  contacted  AWS . They were in constant contact with their  AWS  representative and worked closely with  AWS  to solve problems.  
  The  IC  alerted  Heroku  engineers.

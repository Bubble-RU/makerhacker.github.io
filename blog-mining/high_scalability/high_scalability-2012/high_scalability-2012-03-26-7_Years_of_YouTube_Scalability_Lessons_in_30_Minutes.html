views per second, 694,444 views per minute, and 41,666,667 views per
hour.Update:YouTube: The Platform. YouTube adds a new rich set of APIs in
order to become your video platform leader--all for free. Upload, edit, watch,
search, and comment on video from your own site without visiting YouTube.
Compose your site internally from APIs because you'll need to expose them
later anyway.YouTube grew incredibly fast, to over 100 million video views per
day, with only a handful of people responsible for scaling the site. How did
they manage to deliver all that video to all those users? And how have they
evolved since being acquired by Google?Information SourcesGoogle

<p>Introduction: The addingjitterstrategy was one of the most commented on techniques from7
Years Of YouTube Scalability Lessons In 30 MinutesonHackerNews. Probably
because it's one of the emergent phenomena that you really can't predict and
is shocking when you see it in real life. Here's the technique:Add Entropy
Back into Your SystemIf your system doesn't jitter then you getthundering
herds. Distributed applications are really weather systems. Debugging them is
as deterministic as predicting the weather. Jitter introduces more randomness
because surprisingly, things tend to stack up.For example, cache expirations.
For a popular video they cache things as best they can. The most popular video
they might cache for 24 hours. If everything expires at one time then every
machine will calculate the expiration at the same time. This creates a
thundering herd.By jittering you are saying  randomly expire between 18-30
hours. That prevents things from stacking up. They use this all over the
place.

<p>Introduction: Hi,I am building a video-sharing site and I'm looking for an efficient way to
update video views count.The easiest way would be to perform an SQL update to
increase the "views" counter every time a video is viewed, but naturally I
want to avoid DB write access as much as possible.I am looking for an
efficient temporary storage to which I could connect and say "increment views
of video X". Every so often I would save the changes to my main database, and
remove the counter from this temporary storage.I am having a hard time finding
such temporary storage, however. My first thought was memcache, but it's not
ideal as I wouldn't like to lose the data if memcache goes down. Also,
memcache's increment command requires that the key is already present - that
means that every time a video is viewed, I would have to check if the key
already exists in memcache, before I can actually send the increment

<p>Introduction: Viddler is in the high quality Video as a Service business for a customer who
wants to pay a fixed cost, be done with it, and just have it work. Similar to
Blip and Ooyala, more focussed on business than YouTube. They serve thousands
of business customers, including high traffic websites like FailBlog,
Engadget, and Gawker.Viddler is a good case to learn from because they are a
small company trying to provide a challenging service in a crowded field. We
are catching them just as they transitioning from a startup that began in one
direction, as a YouTube competitor, and pivoted into a slightly larger company
focussed on paying business customers.Transition is the key word for Viddler:
transitioning from a free YouTube clone to a high quality paid service.
Transitioning from a few colo sites that didn't work well to a new higher
quality datacenter. Transitioning from an architecture that was typical of a
startup to one that features redundancy, high availability, and automation.

<p>Introduction: Ever feel like the blogosphere is 500 million channels with nothing on?
Tailrank finds the internet's hottest channels by indexing over 24M weblogs
and feeds per hour. That's 52TB of raw blog content (no, not sewage) a month
and requires continuously processing 160Mbits of IO. How do they do that?This
is an email interview with Kevin Burton, founder and CEO of Tailrank.com.
Kevin was kind enough to take the time to explain how they scale to index the
entire blogosphere.SitesTailrank- We track the hottest news in the

<p>Introduction: A lot has happened since my first article on the Stack Overflow Architecture.
Contrary to the theme of that last article, which lavished attention on Stack
Overflow's dedication to a scale-up strategy, Stack Overflow has both grown up
and out in the last few years.Stack Overflow has grown up by more then
doubling in size to over 16 million users and multiplying its number of page
views nearly 6 times to 95 million page views a month.  Stack Overflow has
grown out by expanding into theStack Exchange Network, which includes Stack
Overflow, Server Fault, and Super User for a grand total of 43 different
sites. That's a lot of fruitful multiplying going on.What hasn't changed is
Stack Overflow's openness about what they are doing. And that's what prompted
this update. A recent series of posts talks a lot about how they've been
handling their growth: Stack Exchange's Architecture in Bullet Points, Stack
Overflow's New York Data Center, Designing For Scalability of Management and

<p>Introduction: Update 35:How and Why Glue is Using Amazon SimpleDB instead of a Relational
Database. Discusses a key design decision that required duplicating data in
order to mimic RDBMS joins:Given the trade off between potential
inconsistencies and scalability, social services have to choose the
latter.Update 34: Apparently Amazon pulled this article. I'm not sure what
that means. Maybe time went backwards or something?Amazon dramatically drops
SimpleDB pricing to $0.25 per GB per month from $1.50 per GB. This puts
SimpleDB on par withGoogle App Engine. They also announced a few new
features:a SQL-like SELECT API as well as a Batch Put operation to streamline
uploading of multiple items or attributes. One of the complaints against
SimpleDB is that programmers end up writing too much code to do simple things.
These features and a much cheaper price should help considerably. And you can
store lots of data now. GAE is still capped.Update 33: Amazon announcesElastic

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Alberto Lopez Toledo, PHD, CTO of Pixable, and Julio
Viera, VP of Engineering at Pixable.Pixableaggregates photos from across your
different social networks and finds the best ones so you never miss an
important moment. That means currently processing the metadata of more than 20
million new photos per day: crawling, analyzing, ranking, and sorting them
along with the other 5+ billion that are already stored in our database.
Making sense of all that data has challenges, but two in particular rise above
the rest:How to access millions of photos per day from Facebook, Twitter,
Instagram, and other services in the most efficient manner.How to process,
organize, index, and store all the meta-data related to those photos.Sure,
Pixable's infrastructure is changing continuously, but there are some things
that we have learned over the last year. As a result, we have been able to
build a scalable infrastructure that takes advantage of today's tools,

Sharing Service Instagram for $1 Billion. Just what is Facebook buying? Here's
a quick gloss I did a little over a year ago on a presentation Instagram gave
on their architecture. In that article I called Instagram's architecture the
"canonical description of an early stage startup in this era." Little did we
know how true that would turn out to be. If you want to learn how they did it
then don't take a picture, just keep on reading...  Instagram is a free photo
sharing and social networking service for your iPhone that has been an instant
success. Growing to14 million usersin just over a year (now 30 million users),

<p>Introduction: InSecrets to Lightning Fast Mobile Design, Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger
shares three strategies Instagram uses to outsmart high latency mobile
networks and make mobile apps feel faster than they really are, which helped
Instagram reach 12 million users in 12 months:The motivation:"mobile
experiences fill gaps while we wait. no one wants to wait while they
wait"Perform actions optimistically. Make the user feel productive. Likes,
comments, and follows are registered on screen while the like operation is
being sent in the background. Adaptively preload content. Load content before
it's needed. Don't images according to time, it will take too long, instead
re-prioritize based on interest. Show what the social network things is the
most popular. Listen to what your user's flicks and taps are telling you.Move
bits when no-one is watching.Picture uploading startsbeforeyou share them,
most apps wait until after the share screen. The rule is send data as soon as
it's ready, then match it</p><p>5 0.19462043 <a title="1228-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-15-Scaling_Pinterest_-_From_0_to_10s_of_Billions_of_Page_Views_a_Month_in_Two_Years.html">1440 high scalability-2013-04-15-Scaling Pinterest - From 0 to 10s of Billions of Page Views a Month in Two Years</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pinterest has been riding an exponential growth curve, doubling every month
and half. They've gone from 0 to 10s of billions of page views a month in two
years, from 2 founders and one engineer to over 40 engineers, from one little
MySQL server to 180 Web Engines, 240 API Engines, 88 MySQL DBs (cc2.8xlarge) +
1 slave each, 110 Redis Instances, and 200 Memcache Instances.Stunning growth.
So what's Pinterest's story? To tell their story we have our bards,
Pinterest'sYashwanth NelapatiandMarty Weiner, who tell the dramatic story of
Pinterest's architecture evolution in a talk titledScaling Pinterest. This is
the talk they would have liked to hear a year and half ago when they were
scaling fast and there were a lot of options to choose from. And they made a
lot of incorrect choices.This is a great talk. It's full of amazing details.
It's also very practical, down to earth, and it contains strategies adoptable
by nearly anyone. Highly recommended.Two of my favorite lessons from the

<p>Introduction: The fascination over Instagram continues and fortunately we have several new
streams of information to feed the insanity. So consider this article an
update toThe Instagram Architecture Facebook Bought For A Cool Billion
Dollars, based primarily onScaling Instagram, a slide deck for an AirBnB tech
talk given by Instagram co-founder, Mike Krieger. Several other information
sources, listed at the bottom of the article, were also used.Unfortunately we
just have a slide deck, so the connective tissue of the talk is missing, but
it's still very interesting, in the same spirit of wisdom presentations we
often see after developers come up for air after spending significant time
spent in the trenches.If you expect to dive deep into the technological
details and find a billion reasons why Instagram was acquired, you will be
disappointed. That magic can be found in the emotional investment in the
relationship between all of the users and the product, not in the bits about
how they bytes are mana</p><p>3 0.95026791 <a title="1228-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-03-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_3%2C_2011.html">1052 high scalability-2011-06-03-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 3, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: With BigData comes BigStorage costs. One way to store less is simplynot to
store the same data twice. That's the radically simple and powerful notion
behind data deduplication. If you are one of those who got a good laugh out of
the idea of eliminating SQL queries as a rather obvious scalability strategy,
you'll love this one, but it is a powerful feature and one I don't hear talked
about outside the enterprise. A parallel idea in programming is the once-and-
only-once principle of never duplicating code.Using deduplication technology,
for some upfront CPU usage, which is a plentiful resource in many systems that
are IO bound anyway, it's possible to reduce storage requirements by upto
20:1, depending on your data, which saves both money and disk write overhead.
This comes up because of really good article Robin Harris of StorageMojo
wrote, All de-dup works, on a paper,  A Study of Practical Deduplication by
Dutch Meyer and William Bolosky, For a great explanation of deduplication we

<p>Introduction: When you're looking to add new tank mates to an existing aquarium ecosystem,
one of the concerns you must have is whether a particular breed of fish is
amenable to conspecific cohabitants. Many species are not, which means if you
put them together in a confined space, they're going to fight. Viciously. To
the death. Responsible aquarists try to avoid such situations, so careful
attention to theconspecificityof animals is a must.Now, while in many respects
the data center ecosystem correlates well to an aquarium ecosystem, in this
case it does not. It's what you usually get, today, but its not actually the
best model. That's because what you want in the data center ecosystem -
particularly when it extends to include publiccloud computingresources - is
conspecificity in infrastructure.This desire and practice is being seen both
in enterprise data center decision making as well as in startups suddenly
dealing with massive growth and increasingly encountering performance
bottlenecks over w</p><p>6 0.93863446 <a title="1228-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-30-The_case_for_functional_decomposition.html">435 high scalability-2008-10-30-The case for functional decomposition</a></p>

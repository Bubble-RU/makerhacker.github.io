<p>Introduction: Update 2:Velocity 09: John Allspaw, 10+ Deploys Per Day: Dev and Ops
Cooperation at Flickr. Insightful talk. Some highlights: Change is good if you
can build tools and culture to lower the risk of change. Operations and
developers need to become of one mind and respect each other. An automated
infrastructure is the one tool you need most. Common source control. One step
build. One step deploy. Don't be a pussy, deploy. Always ship trunk. Feature
flags - don't branch code, make features runtime configurable in code. Dark
launch - release data paths early without UI component. Shared metrics.
Adaptive feedback to prioritize important features. IRC for communication for
human context. Best solutions occur when dev and op work together and trust
each other. Trust is earned by helping each other solve their problems. Look
at what new features imply for operations, what can go wrong, and how to
recover. Provide knobs and levers to help operations. Devs should have access
to production machin</p><p>3 0.12503141 <a title="1288-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-12-Poppen.de_Architecture.html">808 high scalability-2010-04-12-Poppen.de Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest a post by Alvaro Videla describing their architecture
forPoppen.de, a popular German dating site. This site is very much NSFW, so be
careful before clicking on the link. What I found most interesting is how they
manage to sucessfully blend a little of the old with a little of the new,
using technologies like Nginx, MySQL, CouchDB, and Erlang, Memcached,
RabbitMQ, PHP, Graphite, Red5, and Tsung.What is Poppen.de?Poppen.de (NSFW) is
the top dating website in Germany, and while it may be a small site compared
to giants like Flickr or Facebook, we believe it's a nice architecture to
learn from if you are starting to get some scaling problems.The Stats2.000.000

<p>Introduction: We are serving dynamic (PHP) websites and their assets
(JS/CSS/images/videos/binary downloads) via the same apache hosts. The static
files are only being used as origins for CDN services used to distribute those
files. Yet, in the current development-deploy pipeline, these files are
checked into the same version control repositories as the code is. This is
what we would like to change, for several reasons (decouple asset deployment
from development & developers, lessen size of code repositories, etc.)My idea
is to do the following: Set up a media server (cluster) which serves as an API
(REST e.g.). You can PUT files to it, and get back the URL the file is
available through from the public. In between input and output, the media
service deals with everything that's necessary to serve the files: Upload them
to the CDN, create the public URL, write the meta data to a (relational?)
database, assign a version number... This API can be used by a) the
application/website directly to provide C</p><p>5 0.12041451 <a title="1288-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-29-Building_scalable_storage_into_application_-_Instead_of_MogileFS_OpenAFS_etc..html">229 high scalability-2008-01-29-Building scalable storage into application - Instead of MogileFS OpenAFS etc.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi, if you were to design your own highly scalable website from scratch, what
technologies would you use?Based on Web 2.0 popularity, LAMP seems to be high
in the running. But would you tack on CakePHP? Drupal? or build your
framework/CMS from scratch?What version of Linux runs best for a scalable
website?Would you consider Windows and .NET? Java? Or do you want to throw a
brick at me for even suggesting such heresies?Would you prefer Postgres,
Tomcat, Perl, Python, or any of that other *NIX fancy stuff...why or why
not?Please forget for the moment, "use what you know" argument. I am pretty
versatile, and can look for an expert in whatever platform I choose. So all
skills being equal, I'm looking for the best community support, the fastest
development time and most importantly, the best scaling approach.Let's say,
for fun, that I'm planning for the website to have as many messages going back
& forth as an eBay.Definitely building this on a budget..Jason</p><p>3 0.74487227 <a title="1288-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-30-Creating_a_high-performing_online_database_.html">451 high scalability-2008-11-30-Creating a high-performing online database </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi there,I have an idea for an online database that services a large number of
people. I've been studying it for a while and it seems feasible to me to
create it and get people to populate it. It will need time to grow but
eventually it will get there.The model I'm looking at is IMDB, the depth of
information is fascinating, yet it's fast, not so easy to use though, but it's
pretty usable!What do you think I need to create a database an online database
like IMDB. I know that IMDB power comes from it's information, not the design
of the site. This is something I kind of figured out.But what I need to know
is the best tools to publish database contents on the web, retrieve it in that
fast way like IMDB. I'm sure that I will need to create data entry logs for my
users to populate the database.What programming languages you suggest?
development environment? approaches?your contribution is highly
appreciated.Regards,Jalil</p><p>4 0.73055607 <a title="1288-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-29-Building_scalable_storage_into_application_-_Instead_of_MogileFS_OpenAFS_etc..html">229 high scalability-2008-01-29-Building scalable storage into application - Instead of MogileFS OpenAFS etc.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi,I was wondering if anyone has found any information on how to architect a
system to support high availability file uploads. My scenario: I have an
Apache server proxying requests to a bunch of Tomcat Java application servers.
When I need to upgrade my site, I stop and upgrade each of the Tomcat servers
one at a time. This seems to work well as Apache automatically routes
subsequent requests for the stopped app server to the remaining app servers
that are up. The problem is that if a user is uploading a file when the app
server is stopped, the upload fails and the user has to upload the file again.
This is problematic as uploading files is an integral feature of the site and
it's frustrating for the users to have to restart their uploads every time I
upgrade the site (which I want to be able to do frequently).Has anyone seen
any information on how this can be done or have ideas on how this can be
architected? I imagine sites like Flickr must have a solution to this problem
as I have</p><p>6 0.72504115 <a title="1288-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-07-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Web_asset_server_concept_-_3rd_party_software_available%3F.html">1402 high scalability-2013-02-07-Ask HighScalability: Web asset server concept - 3rd party software available?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This question was sent in by Val, who asking for a little help in creating the
next big thing. Any ideas?I'm planning to run my own, first startup website
and have been surfing the webs for relevant info to plan the technology I will
use for it (the frontend and the backend, including the software and the
hardware). The website will be something like a combination of:MegaUpload
(users will upload their files)iTunes (users will be paid for their
uploads)and YouTube (in the future I'm planning to let users watch/listen to
the content online, without downloading).I don't have any investors yet, nor
the budget - I'm still preparing the idea and I'm going to create first
implementation (an "alpha version") before I show it to potential investors.
Hence the initial technologies have to be extremely cheap *but* also highly
scalable in the future so that I don't have to redo anything when the website
grows.Unfortunately I don't have much experience in running big wesites but,

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byBrian Bulkowski, CTO and co-founder ofAerospike, a
leading clustered NoSQL database, has worked in the area of high performance
commodity systems since 1989.This blog post will tell you exactly how to build
a multi-terabyte high throughput datacenter server. A fast, reliable multi-
terrabyte data tier can be used for recent behavior (messages, tweets, plays,
actions), or anywhere that today you use Redis or Memcache.You need to
know:Which SSDs workWhich chassis workHow to configure your RAID cardsIntel's
SATA solutions - combined with a high capacity storage server like the Dell
R720xd and a host bus adapter based on the LSI 2208, and a Flash optimized
database likeAerospike, enables high throughput and low latency.In a wide
configuration, with 12 to 20 drives per 2U server, individual servers can
cost-effectively serve at high throughput with 16T at $2.50 per GB with the
s3700, or $1.25 with the s3500. Other SSD offerings - from Crucial (Micron)

<p>Introduction: "For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing
them." -- AristotleA really nice Internet moment happened in the HackerNews
thread Disqus: Scaling the World's Largest Django Application, when David
Kitchen crafted an awesome responseto a questionabout how you learn to build
scalable systems. It's so good I thought I would reproduce it
here.Question:asked by grovulent:Not like this is a problem I have to worry
about. But where on earth does one learn this stuff? The talk is useful - as
an overview of what they use - but I know nothing of how to implement a single
step.Answer: answered by David Kitchenofburo9:It's called experience. Which
perhaps sounds rude, but it's not meant to be.This stuff isn't taught per se,
you learn it bit by bit as you solve each problem that you face.I learned
about HAProxy when my site load exceeded that which a single web server could
manage.I learned about heartbeat when I had to update my HAProxy and it
knocked the site offline.I</p><p>4 0.86564076 <a title="1288-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-07-Myth%3A_Google_Uses_Server_Farms_So_You_Should_Too_-_Resurrection_of_the_Big-Ass_Machines.html">1075 high scalability-2011-07-07-Myth: Google Uses Server Farms So You Should Too - Resurrection of the Big-Ass Machines</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For a long epoch there was a strategy of scaling up by making ever bigger
super computers. I had the pleasure of programming on a few large massively
multi-processor machines from SGI and DEC. Beautiful, highly specialized
machines that were very expensive. These met the double-tap extinction event
of Moore's law and a Google inspired era of commodity machine based clusters
and extreme software parallelism. Has the tide turned? Does it now make more
sense to use big machines instead of clusters?InBig-Ass Serversâ&bdquo;˘ and the myths
of clusters in bioinformatics, Jerm makes the case that for bionformatics,
it's more cost effective to buy a Big-Ass Server instead of using a cluster of
machines and a lot of specialized parallel programming techniques. It's a
classic scale-up argument that has been made more attractive by the recent
development of relatively inexpensive large machines.SeaMicrohas developed a
512 core machine. Dell has a new96 core server. Supermicro has48 coremachines.

<p>Introduction: Sean Hullwith two helpful posts:5 Things That are Toxic to Scalability:Object
Relational Mappers.Create complex queries that hard to optimize and
tweak.Synchronous, Serial, Coupled or Locking Processes.Locks are like stop
signs, traffic circles keep the traffic flowing. Row level locking is better
than table level locking. Use async replication. Use eventual consistency for
clusters.One Copy of Your Database.A single database server is a choke point.
Create parallel databases and let a driver select between them.Having No
Metrics.Visualize what's happening to your system using one of the many
monitoring packages.Lack of Feature Flags.Be able to turn off features via a
flag so when a spike hits features can be turned off to reduce load.3 Ways to
Boost Cloud Scalability:Use Auto-scaling.Spin-up new instances when a
threshold is passed and back down again when traffic drops.Horizontally Scale

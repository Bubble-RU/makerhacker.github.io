<p>Introduction: Write a little "Hello World" program these days and it runs inside a bewildering Russian Doll of nested environments, each layer adding its own special performance and complexity tax. First, a language executes in its own environment of data structure libraries, memory management, and so on. That, more often than not, will run inside a language VM like the JVM, CLR, or V8. The language VM will in-turn run inside a process that runs inside an OS. An application will run in one or more threads inside a process. And the whole thing will run inside a machine sharing VM layer like Xen. And across all of that are frameworks for monitoring, elasticity, storage, and so on. That's a lot of overhead for a such a little program.
 
What if we could remove all these taxes and run directly on the new bare metal, which some consider to be a combination of M achine VM + Cloud API ?

 Update 7:   How do you know when you need more memcache servers? . Dathan Pattishall talks about using memcache not to scale, but to reduce latency and reduce I/O spikes, and how to use stats to know when more servers are needed.  Update 6:   Stock Traders Find Speed Pays, in Milliseconds . Goldman Sachs is making record profits off a  500 millisecond  trading advantage. Yes, latency matters. As an interesting aside, Libet found 500 msecs is about the time it takes the brain to weave together an experience of consciousness from all our sensor inputs.

<p>Introduction: Mind the Gap: Reconnecting Architecture and OS Research  is a paper presented at  HotOS XIII , the place where researchers talk about making potential futures happen. For a great overview of the conference take a look at this article by Matt Welsh:  Conference report: HotOS 2011 in Napa .
 
In the VM/cloud age I question the need of having an OS at all, programs can compile directly against "raw" hardware, but the paper does a good job of trying to figure out the new roll operating systems can play in the future. We've been in a long OS holding pattern, so long that we've seen the rise of PaaS vendors skipping the OS level abstraction completely, but there's room for a middle ground between legacy time sharing systems of the past and service level APIs that are but one possible future.
 
Introduction:
  For too long, operating systems researchers and developers have pretty much taken whatever computer architects have dished out. With occasional exceptions (e.g., virtualization support)</p><p>4 0.77044773 <a title="1177-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-12-Paper%3A_Network_Stack_Specialization_for_Performance_.html">1594 high scalability-2014-02-12-Paper: Network Stack Specialization for Performance </a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the scalability is specialization department here is an interesting paper presented at  HotNets '13  on high performance networking:  Network Stack Specialization for Performance .
 
The idea is generalizing a service so it fits in the kernel comes at a high performance cost. So move TCP into user space.  The result is a web server with ~3.5x the throughput of Nginx "while experiencing low CPU utilization, linear scaling on multicore systems, and saturating current NIC hardware."
 
Here's a good description of the paper published  on Layer 9 :
  Traditionally, servers and OSes have been built to be general purpose. However now we have a high degree of specialization. In fact, in a big web service, you might have thousands of machines dedicated to one function. Therefore, there's scope for specialization. This paper looks at a specific opportunity in that space. Network stacks today are good for high throughput with large transfers, but not small files (which are common in web browsi</p><p>5 0.76857555 <a title="1177-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-03-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_3rd%2C_2014.html">1572 high scalability-2014-01-03-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 3rd, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There have been reports that  software engineering is dead . Maybe, like the future, software engineering is simply not evenly distributed? When you read this paper I think you'll agree there is some real engineering going on, it's just that most of the things we need to build do not require real engineering. Much like my old childhood tree fort could be patched together and was "good enough." This brings to mind the old joke: If a software tree falls in the woods would anyone hear it fall? Only if it tweeted on the way down...  What this paper really showed me is we need not only to change programming practices and constructs, but we also need to design solutions that allow for deep parallelism to begin with. Grafting parallelism on later is difficult. Parallel execution requires knowing precisely how components are dependent on each other and that level of precision tends to go far beyond the human attention span.  In particular this paper deals with how to parallelize the browser on</p><p>same-blog 2 0.94847435 <a title="1177-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-19-Is_it_time_to_get_rid_of_the_Linux_OS_model_in_the_cloud%3F.html">1177 high scalability-2012-01-19-Is it time to get rid of the Linux OS model in the cloud?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You program in a dynamic language, that runs on a JVM, that runs on a OS designed  40 years ago  for a completely different purpose, that runs on virtualized hardware. Does this make sense? We've talked about this idea before in  Machine VM + Cloud API - Rewriting The Cloud From Scratch , where the vision is to treat  cloud virtual hardware as a compiler target, and converting high-level language source code directly into kernels that run on it. 
 
As new technologies evolve the friction created by our old tool chains and architecture models becomes ever more obvious. Take, for example, what a  team  at  UCSD  is releasing: a  phase-change memory prototype   -  a   solid state storage device that provides performance thousands of times faster than a conventional hard drive and up to seven times faster than current state-of-the-art solid-state drives (SSDs).  However, PCM has access latencies several times slower than DRAM.
 
This technology has obvious mind blowing implications, but an</p><p>3 0.93895727 <a title="1177-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-29-Product%3A_SciDB_-_A_Science-Oriented_DBMS_at_100_Petabytes.html">817 high scalability-2010-04-29-Product: SciDB - A Science-Oriented DBMS at 100 Petabytes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Scientists are doing it for themselves. Doing what? Databases. The idea is that most databases are designed to meet the needs of businesses, not science, so scientists are banding together at  scidb.org  to create their own Domain Specific Database, for science. The goal is to be able to handle datasets in the 100PB range and larger.
  

SciDB, Inc. is building an open source database  technology product designed specifically to satisfy the demands of  data-intensive scientific problems.  With the advice of the world's  leading  scientists across a variety of disciplines including astronomy, biology,   physics, oceanography, atmospheric sciences, and climatology, our  computer  scientists are currently designing and prototyping this technology


The scientists that are participating in our open source project  believe that the SciDB database — when completed — will dramatically  impact their ability to conduct their experiments faster and more  efficiently  and further improve the qual</p><p>4 0.93620652 <a title="1177-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-08-Product%3A_DRBD_-_Distributed_Replicated_Block_Device.html">271 high scalability-2008-03-08-Product: DRBD - Distributed Replicated Block Device</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From their website:   DRBD  is a block device which is designed to build high availability clusters. This is done by mirroring a whole block device via (a dedicated) network. You could see it as a network raid-1.  DRBD takes over the data, writes it to the local disk and sends it to the other host. On the other host, it takes it to the disk there.  
   
  The other components needed are a cluster membership service, which is supposed to be heartbeat, and some kind of application that works on top of a block device.  Examples: A filesystem & fsck. A journaling FS. A database with recovery capabilities.  Each device (DRBD provides more than one of these devices) has a state, which can be 'primary' or 'secondary'. On the node with the primary device the application is supposed to run and to access the device (/dev/drbdX). Every write is sent to the local 'lower level block device' and to the node with the device in 'secondary' state. The secondary device simply writes the data to its lowe</p><p>5 0.93182451 <a title="1177-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-13-DbShards_Part_Deux_-_The_Internals.html">857 high scalability-2010-07-13-DbShards Part Deux - The Internals</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a follow up article by   Cory Isaacson  to the first article on DbShards,   Product: dbShards - Share Nothing. Shard Everything   , describing some of the details about how DbShards works on the inside. 
 
The dbShards architecture is a true “shared nothing” implementation of Database Sharding. The high-level view of dbShards is shown here:    The above diagram shows how dbShards works for achieving massive database scalability across multiple database servers, using native DBMS engines and our dbShards components. The important components are:
  
  dbS/Client : A design goal of dbShards is to make database sharding as seamless as possible to an application, so that application developers can write the same type of code they always have. A key component to making this possible is the dbShards Client. The dbShards Client is our intelligent driver that is an exact API emulation of a given vendor’s database driver.

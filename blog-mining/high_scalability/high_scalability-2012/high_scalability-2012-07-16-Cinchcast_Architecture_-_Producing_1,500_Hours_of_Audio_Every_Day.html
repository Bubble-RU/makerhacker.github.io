<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byDave HaglerSystems Architect at AOL.The AOL homepages
receive more than8 million visitors per day.  That's more daily viewers than
Good Morning America or the Today Show on television.  Over a billion page
views are served each month.  AOL.com has been a major internet destination
since 1996, and still has a strong following of loyal users.The architecture
for AOL.com is in it's 5th generation.  It has essentially been rebuilt from
scratch 5 times over two decades.  The current architecture was designed 6
years ago.  Pieces have been upgraded and new components have been added along
the way, but the overall design remains largely intact.  The code, tools,
development and deployment processes are highly tuned over 6 years of
continual improvement, making the AOL.com architecture battle tested and very
stable.The engineering team is made up of developers, testers, and operations

of scale-up architectures working for what your average sane person would
consider a large system. It doesn't hurt that it's also a sexy story.Update

MonthUpdate 4:Jeff Atwoodcosts out Markus' scale up approach against a scale
out approach and finds scale up wanting. The discussion in the comments is as
interesting as the article. My guess is Markus doesn't want to rewrite his
software to work across a scale out cluster so even if it's more expensive
scale up works better for his needs.Update 3:POF now has 200 million imagesand
serves 10,000 images served per second. They'll be moving to a 250,000 IOPS

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve?

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Jamie Hall, Co-founder & CTO ofMocoSpace, describing
the architecture for their mobile social network. This is a timely
architecture to learn from as it combines several hot trends: it is very
large, mobile, and social. What they think is especially cool about their
system is: how it optimizes for device/browser fragmentation on the mobile
Web; their multi-tiered, read/write, local/distributed caching system;
selecting PostgreSQL over MySQL as a relational DB that can scale.MocoSpace is
a mobile social network, with 12 million members and 3 billion page views a
month, which makes it one of the most highly trafficked mobile Websites in the
US. Members access the site mainly from their mobile phone Web browser,
ranging from high end smartphones to lower end devices, as well as the Web.
Activities on the site include customizing profiles, chat, instant messaging,
music, sharing photos & videos, games, eCards and blogs. The monetization
strategy is focused on advert</p><p>3 0.81002802 <a title="1284-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-17-How_the_AOL.com_Architecture_Evolved_to_99.999%25_Availability%2C_8_Million_Visitors_Per_Day%2C_and_200%2C000_Requests_Per_Second.html">1597 high scalability-2014-02-17-How the AOL.com Architecture Evolved to 99.999% Availability, 8 Million Visitors Per Day, and 200,000 Requests Per Second</a></p>

<p>Introduction: ESPN went on airin 1978. In those 30+ years think of the wonders we've seen!
When I think of ESPN I think of a world wide brand that is the very definition
of prime time. And it shows in their stats. ESPN.com peaks at 100,000 requests
per second. Their peak event is, not surprisingly, the World Cup. But would
you be surprised to learn ESPN is powered by only a few hundred servers and a
couple of dozen engineers? I was.And would you be surprised to learn ESPN is
undergoing a fundamental transition from an Enterprise architecture to one
capable of handling web scale loads driven by increasing mobile usage,
personalization, and a service orientation? Again, thinking ESPN was just
about watching sports on TV, I was surprised. ESPN is becoming much more than
that. ESPN is becoming a sports platform. How does ESPN handle all of this
complexity, responsibility, change, and load? Unlike most every other profile

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byAndy Gelfond, VP of Engineering for TripAdvisor. Andy
has been with TripAdvisor for six and a half years, wrote a lot of code in the
earlier days, and has been building and running a first class engineering and
operations team that is responsible for the worlds largest travel site.
There's an update for this article atAn Epic TripAdvisor Update: Why Not Run
On The Cloud? The Grand Experiment. For TripAdvisor, scalability is woven into
our organization on many levels - data center, software architecture,
development/deployment/operations, and, most importantly, within the culture
and organization. It is not enough to have a scalable data center, or a
scalable software architecture. The process of designing, coding, testing, and
deploying code also needs to be scalable. All of this starts with hiring and a

<p>Introduction: Video is hot on the Internet and people are really interested in knowing how
to make it work. Dan Rayburnhas a post pointing to a fascinating paper: An
Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming, which talks
in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai
use to serve video over on an inherently video unfriendly medium like the
Internet. For Akamai they found:Each video is encoded in five versions at
different bit rates and stored in separate files.The client sends commands to
the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control
algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds. Akamai uses only the video
level to adapt the video source to the available bandwidth, whereas the frame
rate of the video is kept constant.When a sudden drop in the available
bandwidth occurs, short interruptions of the video playback can occur due to
the a large actuation delay.For a sudden increase of the available bandwidth,

<p>Introduction: Looks like an interesting take on "a completely asynchronous, low-latency
transaction management protocol, in line with the fully distributed NoSQL
architecture."Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores
overview:Implementing ACID transactions has been a longstanding challenge for
NoSQL systems. Because these systems are based on a sharded architecture,
transactions necessarily require coordination across multiple servers. Past
work in this space has relied either on heavyweight protocols such as Paxos or
clock synchronization for this coordination.This paper presents a novel
protocol for coordinating distributed transactions with ACID semantics on top
of a sharded data store. Called linear transactions, this protocol achieves
scalability by distributing the coordination task to only those servers that
hold relevant data for each transaction. It achieves high performance by
serializing only those transactions whose concurrent execution could
potentially yield a violation of ACI</p><p>3 0.96906567 <a title="1284-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-16-Book%3A_High_Performance_MySQL.html">16 high scalability-2007-07-16-Book: High Performance MySQL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As users come to depend on MySQL, they find that they have to deal with issues
of reliability, scalability, and performance--issues that are not well
documented but are critical to a smoothly functioning site. This book is an
insider's guide to these little understood topics. Author Jeremy Zawodny has
managed large numbers of MySQL servers for mission-critical work at Yahoo!,
maintained years of contacts with the MySQL AB team, and presents regularly at
conferences. Jeremy and Derek have spent months experimenting, interviewing
major users of MySQL, talking to MySQL AB, benchmarking, and writing some of
their own tools in order to produce the information in this book. In High
Performance MySQL you will learn about MySQL indexing and optimization in
depth so you can make better use of these key features. You will learn
practical replication, backup, and load-balancing strategies with information
that goes beyond available tools to discuss their effects in real-life
environments. And you</p><p>4 0.95866323 <a title="1284-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-04-Scaling_Social_Ecommerce_Architecture_Case_study.html">1016 high scalability-2011-04-04-Scaling Social Ecommerce Architecture Case study</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A recent study showed that over 92 percent of executives from leading
retailers are focusing their marketing efforts on Facebook and subsequent
applications. Furthermore, over 71 percent of users have confirmed they are
more likely to make a purchase after "liking" a brand they find online.

<p>Introduction: I've been trying to find a high availability file storage solution without
success. I tried GlusterFS which looks very promising but experienced problems
with stability and don't want something I can't easily control and rely on.
Other solutions are too complicated or have a SPOF.So I'm thinking of the
following setup:Two NFS servers, a primary and a warm backup. The primary
server will be rsynced with the warm backup every minute or two. I can do it
so frequently as a PHP script will know which directories have changed
recently from a database and only rsync those. Both servers will be NFS
mounted on a cluster of web servers as /mnt/nfs-primary (sym linked as
/home/websites) and /mnt/nfs-backup.I'll then use Ucarp
(http://www.ucarp.org/project/ucarp) to monitor both NFS servers availability
every couple of seconds and when one goes down, the Ucarp up script will be
set to change the symbolic link on all web servers for the /home/websites dir
from /mnt/nfs-primary to /mnt/nfs-backupThe</p><p>6 0.926054 <a title="1284-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-12-Oracle_Can_Do_Read-Write_Splitting_Too.html">182 high scalability-2007-12-12-Oracle Can Do Read-Write Splitting Too</a></p>

[sent-1, score-0.24]
</p><p>2 Ansible is a configuration management tool, deployment tool, and ad- hoc task execution tool all in one. [sent-11, score-0.463]
</p><p>3 It requires no daemons or any other software to start managing remote machines -- it works using SSHd (using paramiko, to make it smoother), which is something nearly everyone is running already. [sent-12, score-0.294]
</p><p>4 Ansibledoeshave a host file, which defines what hosts are in what "groups", and you target hosts either by globs "*. [sent-25, score-0.501]
</p><p>5 If a host isn't listed in the host file, ansible won't manage it. [sent-29, score-0.85]
</p><p>6 A host file, which defaults to /etc/ansible/hosts, looks like this:[dbservers]alpha. [sent-30, score-0.183]
</p><p>7 comWhat's perhaps more interesting is that no software needs to be installed on the remote machines. [sent-38, score-0.183]
</p><p>8 This lack of needing installed software on the remote machines makes it very useful for places where you have a large number of (perhaps legacy) nodes, but no good way to bootstrap them. [sent-40, score-0.276]
</p><p>9 Using Playbooks For ConfigurationAnsible has a powerful but simple configuration management and multinode orchestration format called a "Playbook". [sent-43, score-0.216]
</p><p>10 I've used CentOS-6 as the basis for this example, so users using other operating systems can at least get the idea of what a playbook looks like. [sent-48, score-0.288]
</p><p>11 A playbook can contain more than one play and each play can select a different group of hosts to work with. [sent-50, score-0.56]
</p><p>12 ymlIn the playbook above, we target all nodes in the group "nodes" and in addition to that, explicitly, also add the server named "ganglia. [sent-58, score-0.366]
</p><p>13 yml # this file defines behavior for the 'monitored_server' class of nodes \- name: install gmond action: yum pkg =ganglia-gmond state=installed \- name: configure gmond action: template src=templates/etc/ganglia/gmond. [sent-66, score-0.632]
</p><p>14 conf owner=root group=root notify: \- restart gmond \- name: ensure ganglia is running action: service name=gmond state=runningAs you can see, playbooks are relatively free of programming-language like syntax. [sent-68, score-0.493]
</p><p>15 Well, playbooks are ordered and push-based, so you can address one group of hosts and then another. [sent-74, score-0.529]
</p><p>16 Just include multiple plays in the same playbook file, all in order. [sent-76, score-0.245]
</p><p>17 Ad Hoc TasksA need that comes up frequently when managing a large number of systems is that of running ad-hoc tasks or making things happen via scripts on several machines at once. [sent-79, score-0.162]
</p><p>18 Configuration management and deployment tools are obviously the wrong tools to address this because you don't want to describe the desired steady state of the system, or even a process, you just want to run some commands. [sent-81, score-0.188]
</p><p>19 Ansible allows these kinds of steps to be done using the same management path from which playbooks are applied using the /usr/bin/ansible command line. [sent-83, score-0.465]
</p><p>20 If ansible isn't right for your environment, I at least hope it provides some interesting insight into ways of managing software systems. [sent-86, score-0.812]

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.How do you scale anAWS(Amazon Web Services) infrastructure?
This article will give you a detailed reply in two parts: the tools you can
use to make the most of Amazon's dynamic approach, and the architectural model
you should adopt for a scalable infrastructure.I base my report on my
experience gained in several AWS production projects in casual gaming
(Facebook), e-commerce infrastructures and within the mainstream GIS
(Geographic Information System). It's true that my experience in gaming
(IsCool, The Game) is currently the most representative in terms of
scalability, due to the number of users (over 800 thousand DAU - daily active
users - at peak usage and over 20 million page views every day), however my
experiences in e-commerce and GIS (currently underway) provide a different
view of scalability, taking into account the various problems of availability
and data management. I will therefore</p><p>4 0.11031287 <a title="1230-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-16-Product%3A_Func_-_Fedora_Unified_Network_Controller.html">385 high scalability-2008-09-16-Product: Func - Fedora Unified Network Controller</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Funcis used to manage a large network using bash or Python scripts. It targets
easy and simple remote scripting and one-off tasks over SSH by creating a
secure (SSL certifications) XMLRPC API for communication. Any kind of
application can be written on top of it. Other configuration management tools
specialize in mass configuration. They say here's what the machine should look
like and keep it that way. Func allows you to program your cluster. If you've
ever tried to securely remote script a gang of machines using SSH keys you
know what a total nightmare that can be.Some example commands:Using the

<p>Introduction: At37 SignalsJoshua Sierles describes how 37 Signals usesSprinkleto configure
their servers within EC2. Sprinkledefines a domain specific meta-language for
describing and processing the installation of software. You can find an
interesting discussion of Sprinkle's creation story by the creator himself,
Marcus Crafter, inSprinkle Some Powder!.Marcus divides provisioning tools into
two categories:Task Based- the tool issues a list of commands to run on the
remote system, either remotely via a network connection or smart
client.Policy/state Based- the tool determines what needs to be run on the
remote system by examining its current and final state.Sprinkle combines both
models together in a chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter approach using normal Ruby
code as the DSL (domain specific language) to declaratively describe remote
system configurations. 37 Signals likes the use of Ruby as the DSL because it
makes learning a separate syntax unnecessary. I've successfully done similar
things in Perl.</p><p>4 0.86038202 <a title="1230-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-21-Product%3A_Capistrano_-_Automate_Remote_Tasks_Via_SSH.html">255 high scalability-2008-02-21-Product: Capistrano - Automate Remote Tasks Via SSH</a></p>

declarative (what not how) configuration language for automating common
administration tasks. It's the system every large site writes for themselves
and it's already made for you! Ilike was able to "easily" scale from0 to
hundreds of serversusing Puppet. I can't believe I've never seen this before.
It looks really cool. What is Puppet and how can it help you scale your
website operations?breakFrom the Puppet website:Puppet has been developed to
help the sysadmin community move to building and sharing mature tools that
avoid the duplication of everyone solving the same problem. It does so in two
ways:* It provides a powerful framework to simplify the majority of the
technical tasks that sysadmins need</p><p>6 0.80017292 <a title="1230-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-13-AIDA%3A_Badoo%E2%80%99s_journey_into_Continuous_Integration.html">1531 high scalability-2013-10-13-AIDA: Badoo’s journey into Continuous Integration</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We've seen a lot ofNoSQLaction lately built around distributed hash tables.
Btrees are getting jealous. Btrees, once the king of the database world, want
their throne back.Paul Buchheitsurfaced a paper:A practical scalable
distributed B-treeby Marcos K. Aguilera and Wojciech Golab, that might help
spark a revolution.From the Abstract:We propose a new algorithm for a
practical, fault tolerant, and scalable B-tree distributed over a set of
servers. Our algorithm supports practical features not present in prior work:
transactions that allow atomic execution of multiple operations over multiple
B-trees, online migration of B-tree nodes between servers, and dynamic
addition and removal of servers. Moreover, our algorithm is conceptually
simple: we use transactions to manipulate B-tree nodes so that clients need
not use complicated concurrency and locking protocols used in prior work. To
execute these transactions quickly, we rely on three techniques: (1) We use
optimistic concurrency contro</p><p>5 0.87304968 <a title="1230-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-25-Product%3A_NetApp_MetroCluster_Software.html">28 high scalability-2007-07-25-Product: NetApp MetroCluster Software</a></p>
<p>Introduction: NetApp MetroCluster SoftwareCost-effective is an integrated high-availability
storage cluster and site failover capability.NetApp MetroCluster is an
integrated high-availability and disaster recovery solution that can reduce
system complexity and simplify management while ensuring greater return on
investment. MetroCluster uses clustered server technology to replicate data
synchronously between sites located miles apart, eliminating data loss in case
of a disruption. Simple and powerful recovery process minimizes downtime, with
little or no user action required.At one company I worked at they used the
NetApp snap mirror feature to replicate data across long distances to multiple
datacenters. They had a very fast backbone and it worked well. The issue with
NetApp is always one of cost, but if you can afford it, it's a good option.</p><p>6 0.87207693 <a title="1230-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-11-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_November_11%2C_2011.html">1141 high scalability-2011-11-11-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For November 11, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great scalability solution, but caching also  comes with problems .  Sharding  is a great scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in a  post-mortem  about their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database Foursquare uses, also contributed their  post-mortem  of what went wrong too.
 
Now that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?
 
First, like for  Facebook , huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in a pretty cool industry.
 
Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built by a small group of people, under immense pressure</p><p>3 0.13889101 <a title="1297-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-16-Facebook%27s_New_Real-time_Messaging_System%3A_HBase_to_Store_135%2B_Billion_Messages_a_Month.html">943 high scalability-2010-11-16-Facebook's New Real-time Messaging System: HBase to Store 135+ Billion Messages a Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You may have read somewhere that Facebook has introduced a new  Social Inbox  integrating email, IM, SMS,  text messages, on-site Facebook messages. All-in-all they need to store over 135 billion messages a month. Where do they store all that stuff? Facebook's Kannan Muthukkaruppan gives the surprise answer in  The Underlying Technology of Messages :  HBase . HBase beat out MySQL, Cassandra, and a few others.
 
Why a surprise? Facebook created Cassandra and it was purpose built for an inbox type application, but they found Cassandra's eventual consistency model wasn't a good match for their new real-time Messages product. Facebook also has an extensive  MySQL infrastructure , but they found performance suffered as data set and indexes grew larger. And they could have built their own, but they chose HBase.
 
HBase is a   scaleout table store supporting very high rates of row-level updates over massive amounts of data  . Exactly what is needed for a Messaging system. HBase is also a colu</p><p>4 0.13216044 <a title="1297-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.

<p>Introduction: Mobile developers have a huge scaling problem ahead: doing something useful with massive continuous streams of telemetry data from millions and millions of devices. This is a really good problem to have. It means smartphone sales are finally fulfilling their destiny:  slaughtering PCs  in the sales arena. And it also means mobile devices aren't just containers for simple standalone apps anymore, they are becoming the dominant interface to giant backend systems.
    
While developers are now rocking mobile development on the client side, their next challenge is how to code those tricky backend bits. A company facing those same exact problems right now is  Medialets , a mobile rich media ad platform. What they do is help publishers create high quality interactive ads, though for our purposes their ad stuff isn't that interesting. What I did find really interesting about their system is how they are tackling the problem of defeating the mobile device data deluge.

  Create your own trust nobody point-to-point private cloud. Dan Brown shows how step-by-step in  How I Created My Own Personal Cloud Using BitTorrent Sync, Owncloud, and Raspberry Pi . BitTorrent Sync is used to copy large files around. Raspberry Pi is a cheap low power always on device with BitTorrent Sync installed. Owncloud is an open source cloud that provides a web interface for file access files from anywhere. 
 
 This is different. Funding a  startup using Airbnb  as a source of start-up capital. It beats getting a part-time job and one of your guests might even be a VC. 
 
 This is not different. Old industries clawing and digging in, using the tools of power to beat back competition.

<p>Introduction: Ever wonder what powers Google's world spirit sensing  Zeitgeist service ? No, it's not a homunculus of  Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel  sitting in each browser. It's actually a stream processing (think streaming MapReduce on steroids) system called MillWheel, described in this very well written paper:  MillWheel: Fault-Tolerant Stream Processing at Internet Scale . MillWheel isn't just used for Zeitgeist at Google, it's also used for streaming joins for a variety of Ads customers, generalized anomaly-detection service, and network switch and cluster health monitoring.
 
Abstract:
  MillWheel is a framework for building low-latency data-processing applications that is widely used at Google. Users specify a directed computation graph and application code for individual nodes, and the system manages persistent state and the continuous ﬂow of records, all within the envelope of the framework’s fault-tolerance guarantees.

<p>Introduction: Write a little "Hello World" program these days and it runs inside a bewildering Russian Doll of nested environments, each layer adding its own special performance and complexity tax. First, a language executes in its own environment of data structure libraries, memory management, and so on. That, more often than not, will run inside a language VM like the JVM, CLR, or V8. The language VM will in-turn run inside a process that runs inside an OS. An application will run in one or more threads inside a process. And the whole thing will run inside a machine sharing VM layer like Xen. And across all of that are frameworks for monitoring, elasticity, storage, and so on. That's a lot of overhead for a such a little program.
 
What if we could remove all these taxes and run directly on the new bare metal, which some consider to be a combination of M achine VM + Cloud API ? That's exactly what a system called  Mirage , described in the paper  Turning down the LAMP: Software Specialisation for</p><p>6 0.90629691 <a title="1297-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-16-ThePort__Network__Architecture.html">682 high scalability-2009-08-16-ThePort  Network  Architecture</a></p>

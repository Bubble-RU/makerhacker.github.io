<p>Introduction: A consequence of Service Oriented Architectures is the burning need to provide services at scale. The architecture that has evolved to satisfy these requirements is a little known technique called the Cell Architecture.  A Cell Architecture is based on the idea that massive scale requires parallelization and parallelization requires components be isolated from each other. These islands of isolation are called cells. A cell is a self-contained installation that can satisfy all the operations for a  shard . A shard is a subset of a much larger dataset, typically a range of users, for example.   Cell Architectures have several advantages:
  
 Cells provide a unit of parallelization that can be adjusted to any size as the user base grows. 
 Cell are added in an incremental fashion as more capacity is required. 
 Cells isolate failures. One cell failure does not impact other cells. 
 Cells provide isolation as the storage and application horsepower to process requests is independent of othe</p><p>3 0.35844985 <a title="1240-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-20-The_Tumblr_Architecture_Yahoo_Bought_for_a_Cool_Billion_Dollars.html">1461 high scalability-2013-05-20-The Tumblr Architecture Yahoo Bought for a Cool Billion Dollars</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Benjamin Wootton , CTO of  Contino , a London based consultancy specialising in applying DevOps and Continuous Delivery to software delivery projects.  
 
Microservices are a style of software architecture that involves delivering systems as a set of very small, granular, independent  collaborating services.
 
Though they aren't a particularly new idea, Microservices seem to have exploded in popularity this year, with articles, conference tracks, and Twitter streams waxing lyrical about the benefits of building software systems in this style.
 
This popularity is partly off the back of trends such as Cloud, DevOps and Continuous Delivery coming together as enablers for this kind of approach, and partly off the back of great work at companies such as Netflix who have very visibly applied the pattern to great effect.
 
Let me say up front that I am a fan of the approach.  Microservices architectures have lots of very real and significant benefits:

<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the ACM Queue article have also been included.   Amazon grew from a tiny online bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden shared is version of Amazon's birth pangs in a series of blog articles

<p>Introduction: How is it possible that a wooden Shinto shrine built in the 7th century is still standing? The answer depends on how you answer this philosophical head scratcher: With nearly every cell in your body continually being replaced, are you still the same person?
 
The  Ise Grand Shrine  has been in continuous existence for over 1300 years because every twenty years an exact replica has been rebuilt on an adjacent footprint. The former temple is then dismantled.
 
Now that's resilience. If you want something to last make it a living part of a culture. It's not so much the building that is remade, what is rebuilt and passed down from generation to generation is the meme that the shrine is important and worth preserving. The rest is an unfolding of that imperative.
 
You can see echoes of this same process in Open Source projects like Linux and the libraries and frameworks that get themselves reconstructed in each new environment.
 
The patterns of recurrence in software are the result of Darw</p><p>5 0.7739628 <a title="1240-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-25-Great_Open_Source_Solution_for_Boring_HA_and_Scalability_Problems.html">1522 high scalability-2013-09-25-Great Open Source Solution for Boring HA and Scalability Problems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post about how boring and repetitive HA and scalability problems can be solved via Open Source so you can focus on the interesting tasks. The post was written by  Maarten Ectors , responsible for Cloud Strategy and  Frank Mueller , a Juju Core developer, at  Ubuntu / Canonical . 
 
High-availability and scalability are exciting in general but there are certain problems that experts see over and over again. The list is long but examples are setting up MySQL clustering, sharding Mongo, adding data nodes to a Hadoop cluster, monitoring with Ganglia, building continuous deployment solutions, integrating Memcached / Varnish / Nginx,… Why are we reinventing the wheel?
 
At Ubuntu we made it our goal to have the community solve these repetitive and often boring tasks. How often have you had to set-up MySQL replication and scale it? What if the next time you just simply do:

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my article  Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.   
 
The future looks many, big, complex, and adaptive:
  
 Many clouds.  
 Many servers.  
 Many operating systems.  
 Many languages.  
 Many storage services.  
 Many database services.  
 Many software services.  
 Many adjunct human networks (like Mechanical Turk).  
 Many fast interconnects.  
 Many CDNs.  
 Many cache memory pools.  
 Many application profiles (simple request-response, live streaming, computationally complex, sensor driven, memory intensive, storage intensive, monolithic, decomposable, etc).  
 Many legal jurisdictions. Don't want to perform a function on Patriot Act "protected" systems then move the function elsewhere.  
 Many SLAs.  
 Many data driven pricing policies that like airplane pricing algorithms will price "seats" to maximize profit using multi-variate time sensitive pricing models.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  BugSense  Founder/CTO  Jon Vlachogiannis  and Head of Infrastructure at BugSense  Panagiotis Papadomitsos .         
There has been a lot of speculation and assumptions around whether  PRISM  exists and if it is cost effective. I don't know whether it exists or not, but I can tell you if it could be built.
 
Short answer: It can.
 
If you believe it would be impossible for someone with access to a social "datapool" to find out more about you (if they really want to track you down) in the tsunami of data, you need to think again.
 
Devices, apps and websites are transmitting data. Lots of data. The questions are could the data compiled and searched and how costly would it be to search for your targeted data. (hint: It is not $4.56 trillion).
 
Let's experiment and try to build PRISM by ourselves with a few assumptions:
  
  Assumption 1 : We have all the appropriate "data connectors" that will provide us with data.

<p>Introduction: How do you scale a viral Facebook app that has skyrocketed to a mind boggling 65 million installs (the population of France)? That's the fortunate problem  BuddyPoke  co-founder Dave Westwood has and he talked about his solution at Wednesday's  Facebook Meetup . Slides for the complete talk are  here .  For those not quite sure what BuddyPoke is, it's a social network application that lets users show their mood, hug, kiss, and poke their friends through on-line avatars.
 
In many ways BuddyPoke is the quintessentially modern web application. It thrives off the energy of social network driven ecosystems. Game play mechanics, viral loops, and creative monetization strategies are all part of if its everyday conceptualization. It mashes together different technologies, not in a dark Frankensteining sort of way,  but in a smart way that gets the most bang for the buck. Part of it runs on Facebook servers (free). Part of it runs on flash in a browser (free). Part of it runs on a storage clou</p><p>6 0.98315132 <a title="1240-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-19-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_19%2C_2013.html">1494 high scalability-2013-07-19-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 19, 2013</a></p>

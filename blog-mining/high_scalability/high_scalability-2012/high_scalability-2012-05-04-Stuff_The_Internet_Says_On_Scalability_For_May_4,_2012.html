<p>Introduction: Combining GPU power with PostgreSQL      PostgreSQL is one of the world's leading Open Source databases and it provides enormous flexibility as well as extensibility. One of the key features of PostgreSQL is that users can define their own procedures and functions in basically any known programming language. With the means of functions it is possible to write basically any server side codes easily.     Now, all this extensibility is basically not new. What does it all have to do with scaling and then? Well, imagine a world where the data in your database and enormous computing power are tightly integrated. Imagine a world where data inside your database has direct access to hundreds of FPUs. Welcome to the world of CUDA, NVIDIA's way of making the power of graphics cards available to normal, high-performance applications.     When it comes to complex computations databases might very well turn out to be a bottleneck. Depending on your application it might easily happen that adding more</p><p>3 0.11455098 <a title="1239-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-15-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_15%2C_2011.html">1024 high scalability-2011-04-15-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 15, 2011</a></p>

 We have a Qutoable Quote machine for you today:    
 
  @kevinweil : Twitter monthly signups have increased more than 50% since December, and we're now doing well over 150 million Tweets per day. 
  @ChrisShain : Prediction: Black art of query optimization will become black art of #nosql data modeling, for same reasons. Minimize IOs, query time. 
  @ui_matters : Infrastructure as a Service = no hardware headaches. Platform as a Svc = no scalability headaches. SaaS = common dev platform #amchamtech

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.
 
Let's change that.

<p>Introduction: On the surface nothing appears more different than soft data and hard raw materials like iron. Then isn’t it  ironic , in the  Alanis Morissette  sense,  that in this Age of Information, great wealth still lies hidden deep beneath piles of stuff?  It's so strange how directly digging for dollars in data parallels the great wealth producing models of the Industrial Revolution.
 
The piles of stuff is the Internet. It takes lots of prospecting to find the right stuff. Mighty web crawling machines tirelessly collect stuff, bringing it into their huge maws, then depositing load after load into rack after rack of distributed file system machines. Then armies of still other machines take this stuff and strip out the valuable raw materials, which in the Information Age, are endless bytes of raw data. Link clicks, likes, page views, content, head lines, searches, inbound links, outbound links, search clicks, hashtags, friends, purchases: anything and everything you do on the Internet is a valu</p><p>6 0.10735849 <a title="1239-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

  Tesla : When wireless is perfectly applied the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain, which in fact it is, all things being particles of a real and rhythmic whole. We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance. Not only this, but through television and telephony we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of miles; and the instruments through which we shall be able to do this will be amazingly simple compared with our present telephone. A man will be able to carry one in his vest pocket.

<p>Introduction: As part of  Dr. Indranil Gupta 's  CS 525 Spring 2011 Advanced Distributed Systems  class, he has collected an incredible  list of resources on distributed systems . His  research group  is also doing some interesting work.
 
The  various topics  include: Before there Were Clouds, Cloud Computing, P2P Systems, Basic Distributed Computing Concepts, Sensor Networks, Overlays and DHTs, Cloud Programming, Cloud Scheduling, Key-Value Stores, Storage, Sensor Net Routing, Geo-Distribution, P2P Apps, In-network processing, Epidemics, Probabilistic Membership Protocols, Distributed Monitoring and  Management, Publish-Subscribe/CDNs, Measurement Studies, Old Wine: Stale or Vintage?, In Byzantium, Cloud Pricing, Other Industrial Systems, Structure of Networks, Completing the Circle, Green Clouds, Distributed Debugging, Flash!, The Middle or the End?, Availability-Aware Systems, Design Methodologies, Handling Stress, Sources of unreliability in networks, Handling Stress, Selfish algorithms, Securi</p><p>2 0.96330363 <a title="1239-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-04-Try_Squid_as_a_Reverse_Proxy.html">59 high scalability-2007-08-04-Try Squid as a Reverse Proxy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This scalability strategy is brought to you by Erik Osterman:   My recommendations for anyone dealing with explosive growth on a limited budget with lots of cachable content (e.g. content capable of returning valid expiration headers) is employ a    reverse proxy    as mentioned in this article.   In the last week, we had a site get AP'd, triggering 100K unique visitors to a single IIS server in under 5 hours. It took out the IIS server. Placing a single squid infront of the server handled the entire onslaught with a max server load of 0.10 on a modest Intel IV 3Ghz.  It's trivial to implement for anyone interested...</p><p>3 0.94828629 <a title="1239-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-06-Product%3A_ChironFS.html">143 high scalability-2007-11-06-Product: ChironFS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are trying to create highly available file systems, especially across data centers,  then ChironFS is one potential solution. It's relatively new, so there aren't lots of experience reports, but it looks worth considering. What is  ChironFS  and how does it work?
 
Adapted from the ChironFS website:   The Chiron Filesystem is a Fuse based filesystem that frees you from single points of failure. It's main purpose is to guarantee filesystem availability using replication. But it isn't a RAID implementation. RAID replicates DEVICES not FILESYSTEMS.  Why not just use RAID over some network block device? Because it is a block device and if one server mounts that device in RW mode, no other server will be able to mount it in RW mode. Any real network may have many servers and offer a variety of services. Keeping everything running can become a real nightmare!</p><p>4 0.94445688 <a title="1239-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-23-Synchronizing_Memcached_application.html">191 high scalability-2007-12-23-Synchronizing Memcached application</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Mind the Gap: Reconnecting Architecture and OS Research  is a paper presented at  HotOS XIII , the place where researchers talk about making potential futures happen. For a great overview of the conference take a look at this article by Matt Welsh:  Conference report: HotOS 2011 in Napa .
 
In the VM/cloud age I question the need of having an OS at all, programs can compile directly against "raw" hardware, but the paper does a good job of trying to figure out the new roll operating systems can play in the future. We've been in a long OS holding pattern, so long that we've seen the rise of PaaS vendors skipping the OS level abstraction completely, but there's room for a middle ground between legacy time sharing systems of the past and service level APIs that are but one possible future.

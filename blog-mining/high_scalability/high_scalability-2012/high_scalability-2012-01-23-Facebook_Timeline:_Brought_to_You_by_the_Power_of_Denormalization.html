<p>Introduction: Toy solutions solving Twitter's "problems" are a favorite scalability trope.
Everybody has this idea that Twitter is easy. With a little architectural hand
waving we have a scalable Twitter, just that simple. Well, it's not that
simple asRaffi Krikorian, VP of Engineering at Twitter, describes in his
superb and very detailed presentation onTimelines at Scale. If you want to
know how Twitter works - then start here.It happened gradually so you may have
missed it, but Twitter has grown up. It started as a strugglingthree-tierish
Ruby on Railswebsite to become a beautifully service driven core that we
actually go to now to see if other services are down. Quite a change.Twitter
now has 150M world wide active users, handles 300K QPS to generate timelines,
and a firehose that churns out 22 MB/sec. 400 million tweets a day flow
through the system and it can take up to 5 minutes for a tweet to flow from
Lady Gaga's fingers to her 31 million followers.A couple of points stood

<p>Introduction: Real-time social graphs (connectivity between people, places, and things).
That's why scaling Facebook is hardsays Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of
Technology at Facebook. Social networking sites like Facebook, Digg, and
Twitter are simply harder than traditional websites to scale. Why is that? Why
would social networking sites be any more difficult to scale than traditional
web sites? Let's find out.Traditional websites are easier to scale than social
networking sites for two reasons:They usually access only their own data and
common cached data.Only 1-2% of users are active on the site at one
time.Imagine a huge site like Yahoo. When you come to Yahoo they can get your
profile record with one get and that's enough to build your view of the
website for you. It's relatively straightforward to scale systems based around
single records usingdistributed hashing schemes. And since only a few percent
of the people are on the site at once it takes comparatively little RAM cache
to handle a</p><p>4 0.12526891 <a title="1179-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-08-Yahoo%21%27s_PNUTS_Database%3A_Too_Hot%2C_Too_Cold_or_Just_Right%3F.html">676 high scalability-2009-08-08-Yahoo!'s PNUTS Database: Too Hot, Too Cold or Just Right?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: So far every massively scalable database is a bundle of compromises. For some
the weak guarantees of Amazon'seventual consistencymodel are too cold. For
many the strong guarantees of standard RDBMSdistributed transactionsare too
hot. Google App Engine tries to get it just right withentity groups. Yahoo! is
also trying to get is just right by offering per-record timeline consistency,
which hopes to serve up a heaping bowl ofrich database functionality and low
latency at massive scale:We describe PNUTS [Platform for Nimble Universal
Table Storage], a massively parallel and geographically distributed database
system for Yahoo!'s web applications. PNUTS provides data storage organized as
hashed or ordered tables, low latency for large numbers of con-current
requests including updates and queries, and novel per-record consistency
guarantees. It is a hosted, centrally managed, and geographically distributed
service, and utilizes automated load-balancing and failover to reduce

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Alberto Lopez Toledo, PHD, CTO of Pixable, and Julio
Viera, VP of Engineering at Pixable.Pixableaggregates photos from across your
different social networks and finds the best ones so you never miss an
important moment. That means currently processing the metadata of more than 20
million new photos per day: crawling, analyzing, ranking, and sorting them
along with the other 5+ billion that are already stored in our database.
Making sense of all that data has challenges, but two in particular rise above
the rest:How to access millions of photos per day from Facebook, Twitter,
Instagram, and other services in the most efficient manner.How to process,
organize, index, and store all the meta-data related to those photos.Sure,
Pixable's infrastructure is changing continuously, but there are some things
that we have learned over the last year. As a result, we have been able to
build a scalable infrastructure that takes advantage of today's tools,
languages and cloud s</p><p>6 0.10334875 <a title="1179-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-08-Medialets_Architecture_-__Defeating_the_Daunting_Mobile_Device_Data_Deluge.html">1000 high scalability-2011-03-08-Medialets Architecture -  Defeating the Daunting Mobile Device Data Deluge</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Facebook did it again. They've built another system capable of doing something
useful with ginormous streams of realtime data. Last time we saw Facebook
release their New Real-Time Messaging System: HBase To Store 135+ Billion
Messages A Month. This time it's a realtime analytics system handlingover 20
billion events per day (200,000 events per second) with a lag of less than 30
seconds. Alex Himel, Engineering Manager at Facebook, explains what they've
built (video) and the scale required:Social plugins have become an important
and growing source of traffic for millions of websites over the past year. We
released a new version of Insights for Websites last week to give site owners
better analytics on how people interact with their content and to help them
optimize their websites in real time. To accomplish this, we had to engineer a
system that could process over 20 billion events per day (200,000 events per

<p>Introduction: Aditya Agarwal, Director of Engineering at Facebook, gave an excellent Scale
at Facebooktalk that covers their architecture, but the talk is really more
about how to scale an organization by preserving the best parts of its
culture. The key take home of the talk is: You can get the code right, you can
get the products right, but you need to get the culture right first. If you
don't get the culture right then your company won't scale.This leads into the
four meta secrets of scaling at Facebook:Scaling takes IterationDon't Over
DesignChoose the right tool for the job, but realize that your choice comes
with overhead.Get the culture right. Move Fast \- break things. Huge Impact \-
small teams. Be bold \- innovate.Some Background Facebook is big: 400 million

<p>Introduction: nginx is a high performance smtp/pop/imap proxy that lets you do custom
authorization and lookups and is very scalable. (just add nodes)Nginx by
default is a reverse proxy and this is what it is doing here for pop/imap
connections. It is also an excellelent reverse proxy for web
servers.Advantage: You dont have to have a speacial database or ldap schema.
Just an url to do auth and lookup with.A url that may be accessed by a unix or
a tcp socket. Write your own auth handler - according to your own policy.For
example:A user called atif tries to login with the pass testxyz.You pass this
infomation to a URL such assocket:/var/tmp/xyz.sockorhttp://auth.corp.mailserv
er.net:someport/someurlThe auth server replies with either a FAILURE such
asAuth-Status: Invalid Login or passwordor with a success such asAuth-Status:

<p>Introduction: Facebook Timeline is audacious in scope. It wants to compile a complete
scrollable version of your life story from photos, locations, videos, status
updates, and everything you do. That could be many decades of data (hopefully)
that must stored and made quickly available at any point in time. A huge
technical challenge, even for Facebook, which we know are experts inhanding
big data. And they built it all in 6 months.Facebook's Ryan Mack shares quite
a bit of Timeline's own implementation story in his excellent article:Building
Timeline: Scaling up to hold your life story. Five big takeaways from the
article are:Leverage infrastructure rather than build something new. You might
expect that they would pioneer a new infrastructure for Timeline, but given
the short schedule, they decided to go with proven technologies inside
Facebook: MySQL,Multifeed (a custom distributed system which takes the tens of
thousands of updates from friends and picks the most relevant), Thrift,

<p>Introduction: Constructing a scalablerisk analysis solution is a fascinating architectural
challenge. If you come from Financial Services you are sure to appreciate
that. But even architects from other domains are bound to find the challenges
fascinating, and the architectural patterns of my suggested solution highly
useful in other domains.Recently I held an interesting webinar around
architecting solutions for scalable and near-real-time risk analysis solutions
based on experience gathered with Financial Services customers. Seeing the
vast interest in the webinar, I would like to share the highlights with you
here.From an architectural point of view, risk analysis is a data-intensive
and a compute-intensive process, which also has an elaborate orchestration
logic. volumes in this domain are massive and ever-increasing, together with
an ever-increasing demand to reduce response time. These trends are aggravated
by global financial regulatory reforms set following the late-2000s financial
crisis, wh</p><p>5 0.85921913 <a title="1179-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-16-Scaling_Secret_%232%3A_Denormalizing_Your_Way_to_Speed_and_Profit.html">65 high scalability-2007-08-16-Scaling Secret #2: Denormalizing Your Way to Speed and Profit</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alan Watts once observed how after we accepted Descartes' separation of the
mind and body we've been trying to smash them back together again ever since
when really they were never separate to begin with.The database normalization-
denormalization dualism has the same mobius shaped reverberations as
Descartes' error. We separate data into a million jagged little pieces and
then spend all our time stooping over, picking them and up, and joining them
back together again.Normalization has been standard practice now for decades.
But times are changing. Many mega-website architects are concluding Watts was
right: the data was never separate to begin with. And even more radical, we
may even need to store multiple copies of data.breakInformation

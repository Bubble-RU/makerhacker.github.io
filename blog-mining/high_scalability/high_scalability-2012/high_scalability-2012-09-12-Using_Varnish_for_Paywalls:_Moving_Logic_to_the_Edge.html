</p><p>6 In a traditional environment the caching layer only serves up pieces of content without giving any thought to who gets access to it. [sent-11, score-0.533]
</p><p>7 Since the rules governing access control can be rather complex these rules have traditionally been implemented in the application server, which is slow. [sent-12, score-0.625]
</p><p>8 We’ve seen companies struggle with performance as they suddenly have to revert to serving content from their application layer again. [sent-13, score-0.379]
</p><p>9 With a bit of effort and some open source magic you can have your lunch and eat it too: serve access controlled content from the caching edge layer. [sent-14, score-0.833]
</p><p>10 One would be a  header  coming from the origin server indicating that this piece of information is under access control, maybe X-Access-Control. [sent-17, score-0.415]
</p><p>11 If the header is present Varnish would then check whether the user is logged in or not, using a cookie. [sent-18, score-0.179]
</p><p>12 This cookie would be set by an authentication service, and if you are worried about users cheating you could secure it by signing the cookie cryptographically. [sent-19, score-0.804]
</p><p>13 It’s possible, but not recommended to implement the actual authentication in Varnish itself using modules to access data in a database or another data source. [sent-20, score-0.321]
</p><p>14 Authenticated access is not the only option, you might also want to limit access to say 5 articles per user per week. [sent-22, score-0.358]
</p><p>15 If so, you would store the read article count in a signed cookie or a NoSQL database like Redis or MemcacheDB. [sent-23, score-0.353]
</p><p>16 To do this you extend Varnish through the use of a Varnish Module as VCL itself lacks flow control structures such as for loops. [sent-24, score-0.145]
</p><p>17 You could just check for the presence of a certain value in a cookie and you’ve proven the concept. [sent-28, score-0.285]

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Block , CTO at  RockThePost.com , a crowdfunding company, has  written a nice set of tips  for smaller sites on how to scale a service on EC2 using a small two person development team. 
 
Their service has a typical small scale structure:
  
 PHP's Zend Framework 2 
 Two m1.medium for web servers 
 ELB to split the load 
 master/slave MySQL database 
 Siege for load testing 
  
The very sensible tips that can handle 30,000 concurrent users per web server: 
  
  Use PHP's APC feature . APC is opcode cache that is " really a requirement in order for a website to have a chance at performing well."  
  Put everything that's not a .php request on a CDN . Don't serve static files from your web server. They put everything on S3 and use CloudFront as their CDN. Recent CloudFront problems have caused them to serve directly from S3. 
  Don't make connections to other servers in your PHP code . Making connections to other servers blocks the server and slows down processing. Use the APC k</p><p>4 0.16850686 <a title="1321-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-13-What%27s_your_scalability_plan%3F.html">248 high scalability-2008-02-13-What's your scalability plan?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you plan to scale your system as you reach predictable milestones? This topic came up in another venue and it reminded me about a great comment an Anonymous wrote a while ago and I wanted to make sure that comment didn't get lost.      The Anonymous scaling plan was relatively simple and direct:    My two cents on what I'm using to start a website from scratch using a single server for now. Later, I'll scale out horizontally when the need arises.   Phase 1            Single Server, Dual Quad-Core 2.66, 8gb RAM, 500gb Disk Raid 10   OS: Fedora 8. You could go with pretty much any Linux though. I like Fedora 8 best for servers.   Proxy Cache: Varnish - it is way faster than Squid per my own benchmarks. Squid chokes bigtime.   Web Server: Lighttpd - faster than Apache 2 and easier to configure for me.   Object Cache: Memcached. Very scalable.   PHP Cache: APC. Easy to configure and seems to work fine.   Language: PHP 5 - no bloated frameworks, waste of time for me. You spend too mu</p><p>5 0.16380179 <a title="1321-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-28-6_Strategies_for_Scaling_BBC_iPlayer.html">908 high scalability-2010-09-28-6 Strategies for Scaling BBC iPlayer</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The BBC's iPlayer site averages 8 million page views a day for 1.3 million users. Technical Architect Simon Frost describes how they scaled their site in   Scaling the BBC iPlayer to handle demand :
  
  Use frameworks . Frameworks support component based development which makes it convenient for team development, but can introduce delays that have to be minimized. Zend/PHP is used because it supports components and is easy to recruit for.Â  MySQL is used for program metadata. CouchDB is used for key-value access for fast read/write of user-focused data. 
  Prove architecture before building it . Eliminate guesswork by coming up with alternate architectures and create prototypes to determine which option works best. Balance performance with factors like ease of development.  
  Cache a lot . Data is cached in memcached for a few seconds to minutes. Short cache invalidation periods keep the data up to date for the users, but even these short periods make a huge difference in performance.</p><p>6 0.15694256 <a title="1321-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-16-A_Short_on_the_Pinterest_Stack_for_Handling_3%2B_Million_Users.html">1193 high scalability-2012-02-16-A Short on the Pinterest Stack for Handling 3+ Million Users</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Performance guru  Steve Souders  gave his keynote presentation,  Cache is King!  ( slides ), at the HTML5DevCon, besides being an extremely clear explanation of how caching works on the Internet and how to optimize your use of HTTP to get the best performance, Steve ran experiments that found some surprising results on what gave the best web site performance improvements.
 
In his base line test, page loads took 7.65 seconds (median of three runs). What change--Fast Network, No Javascript, or Primed Cache--would make the biggest performance improvement? It was Primed Cache.
  
 Fast Network - Using a fast FIOS network the load time was 4.13 seconds. Steve was surprised how big a difference this made, given how much work must happen in the browser.  
 No JavaScript - 4.74 seconds after disabling JavaScript. Both reduces transfers and skips parsing by the browser. Steve thought the effect would have been larger.

<p>Introduction: Update:  Asynchronous  HTTP cache validations . A proposed HTTP caching extension:  if your application can afford to show slightly out of date content, then stale-while-revalidate can guarantee that the user will always be served directly from the cache, hence guaranteeing a consistent response-time user-experience.   Caching is like aspirin for headaches. Head hurts: pop a 'sprin. Slow site: add caching.  Facebook  must have a lot of headaches because they popped 805 memcached servers between 10,000 web servers and 1,800 MySQL servers and they reportedly have a 99% cache hit rate. But what's the best way for you to cache for your application? It's a remarkably complex and rich topic. Alexey Kovyrin talks about one common caching problem called the   Dog Pile  Effect  in  Dog-pile Effect and How to Avoid it with Ruby on Rails .

<p>Introduction: Isn't the secret to fast, scalable websites to  cache everything ? Caching, if not the  secret sauce  of many a website, is it at least a popular condiment. But not so fast says Peter Zaitsev in  Beyond great cache hit ratio . The point Peter makes is that we read about websites like  Amazon  and  Facebook  that can literally make hundreds of calls to satisfy a user request. Even if you have an awesome cache hit ratio, pages can still be slow because making and processing all those requests takes time. The solution is to  remove requests all together . You do this by  caching larger blocks  so you have to make fewer requests. 
 
The post has a lot of good advice worth reading: 1) Make non cacheable blocks as small as possible, 2) Maximize amount of uses of the cache item, 3) Control invalidation, 4) Multi-Get.</p><p>6 0.71985614 <a title="1321-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-20-Strategy%3A_Front_S3_with_a_Caching_Proxy.html">353 high scalability-2008-07-20-Strategy: Front S3 with a Caching Proxy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Under the philosophy that  the best method to analyse spam is to become a spammer , this absolutely fascinating paper recounts how a team of UC Berkely researchers went under cover to infiltrate a spam network. Part CSI, part Mission Impossible, and part MacGyver, the team hijacked the botnet so that their code was actually part of the dark network itself. Once inside they figured out the architecture and protocols of the botnet and how many sales they were able to tally. Truly elegant work.   Two different spam campaigns were run on a  Storm  botnet network of 75,800 zombie computers. Storm is a peer-to-peer botnet that uses spam to creep its tentacles through the world wide computer network. One of the campains distributed viruses in order to recruit new bots into the network. This is normally accomplished by enticing people to download email attachments. An astonishing one in ten people downloaded the executable and ran it, which means we won't run out of zombies soon.

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my blogpost  Working With Large Data Sets ...
 
For the past 18 months I’ve moved from working on the SMTP proxy to working on our other systems, all of which make use of the data we collect from each connection. It’s a fair amount of data and it can be up to 2Kb in size for each connection. Our servers receive approximately 1000 of these pieces of data per second, which is fairly sustained due to our global distribution of customers. If you compare that to  Twitter’s peak of 3,283 tweets per second  (maximum of 140 characters), you can see it’s not a small amount of data that we are dealing with here.
 
I recently set out to scientifically prove the benefits of throttling, which is our technology for slowing down connections in order to detect spambots, who are kind enough to disconnect quite quickly when they see a slow connection. Due to the nature of the data we had, I needed to work with a long range of data to show evidence that an IP that appeared on Spam</p><p>3 0.92032814 <a title="1321-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-30-Paper%3A_GargantuanComputing%E2%80%94GRIDs_and_P2P.html">374 high scalability-2008-08-30-Paper: GargantuanComputing—GRIDs and P2P</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I found the discussion of the available bandwidth of tree vs higher dimensional virtual networks topologies quite, to quote Spock,  fascinating :   A mathematical analysis by Ritter (2002) (one of the original developers of Napster) presented a detailed numerical argument demonstrating that the Gnutella network could not scale to the capacity of its competitor,  the Napster network. Essentially, that model showed that the Gnutella network is severely bandwidth-limited long before the P2P population reaches a million peers.  In each of these previous studies, the conclusions have overlooked the intrinsic bandwidth limits of the underlying topology in the Gnutella network: a Cayley tree (Rains and Sloane 1999) (see Sect. 9.4 for the definition).  Trees are known to have lower aggregate bandwidth than higher dimensional topologies, e.g., hypercubes and hypertori. Studies of interconnection topologies in the literature have tended to focus on hardware implementations (see, e.g., Culler et</p><p>4 0.90330601 <a title="1321-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-23-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_December_23%2C_2011.html">1163 high scalability-2011-12-23-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For December 23, 2011</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A merry HighScalability to all and to all a good night:
  
 Santa: 3.7 million appointments; iPad2 ==  1986 Cray 2 6 processor super computer ; Watson:  200 million pages  of natural language content  
 Funny:  a cautionary tale about storage and backup .  Where is my data? I’m kinda big deal after all! I should have listened to my postdoc, he can build cheaper storage than you can.  
 Nothing stirs up more energy than when someone says they are abandoning and old beloved framework for a newer sexier model. Feelings of betrayal and abandonment leak over everything, which is always a good draw for reality social networking. Here Paul Querna tells why  The Switch: Python to Node.js . And here we see the response on  Hacker News . Python got the job done for cloudkick, they were acquired, but they wanted something more going forward, a trophy wife if you will, after the first wife put them through law school.

<p>Introduction: Update 2:  A  HSCALE benchmark  finds HSCALE "adds a maximum overhead of about 0.24 ms per query (against a partitioned table)."  Future releases  promise much improved results.  Update:  A new presentation at  An Introduction to HSCALE .   After writing  Skype Plans for PostgreSQL to Scale to 1 Billion Users , which shows how Skype smartly uses a proxy architecture for scaling, I'm now seeing MySQL Proxy articles all over the place. It's like those "get rich quick" books that say all you have to do is visualize a giraffe with a big yellow dot superimposed over it and by sympathetic magic giraffes will suddenly stampede into your life. Without realizing it I must have visualized transparent proxies smothered in yellow dots.  One of the brightest images is a wonderful series of articles by Peter Romianowski describing the evolution of their proxy architecture. Their application is an OLTP system executing 200 million transaction per month, tables with more than 1.5 billion rows, and a 6</p><p>6 0.89665234 <a title="1321-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-05-5_Ways_to_Make_Cloud_Failure_Not_an_Option.html">1367 high scalability-2012-12-05-5 Ways to Make Cloud Failure Not an Option</a></p>

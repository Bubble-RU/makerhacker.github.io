<p>Introduction: The transport-level server load balancing architectures described inthe first
half of this articleare more than adequate for many Web sites, but more
complex and dynamic sites can't depend on them. Applications that rely on
cache or session data must be able to handle a sequence of requests from the
same client accurately and efficiently, without failing. In this follow up to
his introduction to server load balancing, Gregor Roth discusses various
application-level load balancing architectures, helping you decide which one
will best meet the business requirements of your Web site.The first half of
this articledescribes transport-level server load balancing solutions, such as
TCP/IP-based load balancers, and analyzes their benefits and disadvantages.
Load balancing on the TCP/IP level spreads incoming TCP connections over the
real servers in a server farm. It is sufficient in most cases, especially for
static Web sites. However, support for dynamic Web sites often requires

<p>Introduction: Jesper Soderlund put together an excellent list of four general scalability
patterns and four subpatterns in his postScalability patterns and an
interesting story:Load distribution- Spread the system load across multiple
processing unitsLoad balancing / load sharing- Spreading the load across many
components with equal properties for handling the requestPartitioning-
Spreading the load across many components by routing an individual request to
a component that owns that data specificVertical partitioning- Spreading the
load across the functional boundaries of a problem space, separate functions
being handled by different processing unitsHorizontal partitioning- Spreading
a single type of data element across many instances, according to some
partitioning key, e.g. hashing the player id and doing a modulus operation,
etc. Quite often referred to as sharding.Queuing and batch \- Achieve
efficiencies of scale by processing batches of data, usually because the
overhead of an operation is am</p><p>4 0.17340839 <a title="1325-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-22-Applying_Scalability_Patterns_to_Infrastructure_Architecture.html">906 high scalability-2010-09-22-Applying Scalability Patterns to Infrastructure Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Too often software design patterns are overlooked by network and application
delivery network architects but these patterns are often equally applicable to
addressing a broad range of architectural challenges in the application
delivery tier of the data center. By Lori Mac Vittie, F5 Networks The "High
Scalability" blog is fast becoming one of my favorite reads. Last week did not
disappoint with a posthighlighting a set of scalability design patternsthat
was, apparently, inspired by yet another High Scalability post on "6 Ways to
Kill Your Servers: Learning to Scale the Hard Way." Credit:Michael
Chow/azcentral.com  This particular post caught my attention primarily because
although I've touched on many of these patterns in the past, I've never
thought to call them what they are: scalability patterns. That's probably a
side-effect of forgetting thatbuilding an architecture of any kind is at its
core computer scienceand thus algorithms and design patterns are applicable to

<p>Introduction: InClient Side Load Balancing for Web 2.0 Applicationsauthor Lei Zhu suggests a
very interesting approach to load balancing: forget DNS round robbin, toss
your expensive load balancer, and make your client do the load balancing for
you. Your client maintains a list of possible servers and cycles through them.
All the details are explained in the article, but it's an intriguing idea,

<p>Introduction: A superb explanation by Theo Schlossnagle of how to deploy a high availability
load balanced system using mod backhand andWackamole. The idea is you don't
need to buy expensive redundant hardware load balancers, you can make use of
the hosts you already have to the same effect. The discussion of using peer-
based HA solutions versus a single front-end HA device is well worth the read.
Another interesting perspective in the document is to view load balancing as a
resource allocation problem. There's also a nice discussion of the negative of
effect of keep-alives on performance.</p><p>5 0.79185438 <a title="1325-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-05-Product%3A_HAProxy_-_The_Reliable%2C_High_Performance_TCP-HTTP_Load_Balancer.html">509 high scalability-2009-02-05-Product: HAProxy - The Reliable, High Performance TCP-HTTP Load Balancer</a></p>

for TCP and HTTP-based applications. It is particularly suited for web sites
crawling under very high loads while needing persistence or Layer7 processing.
Supporting tens of thousands of connections is clearly realistic with todays
hardware. Its mode of operation makes its integration into existing
architectures very easy and riskless, while still offering the possibility not
to expose fragile web servers to the Net.Currently, two major versions are

<p>Introduction: If you are looking for an excellent overview of general architecture
principles then take a look at Will Larson's Introduction to Architecting
Systems for Scale. Based on his experiences at Yahoo! and Digg, Will covers
key concepts in some depth. A quick gloss on the building blocks:Load
Balancing: Scalability & Redundancy.Horizontal scalability and redundancy are
usually achieved via load balancing, the spreading of requests across multiple
resources.Smart Clients.The client has a list of hosts and load balances
across that list of hosts. Upside is simple for programmers. Downside is it's
hard to update and change.Hardware Load Balancers.Targeted at larger
companies, this is dedicated load balancing hardware. Upside is performance.
Downside is cost and complexity.Software Load Balancers.The recommended
approach, it's  software that handles load balancing, health checks,
etc.Caching.Make better use of resources you already have. Precalculate
results for later use.

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Block, CTO atRockThePost.com, a crowdfunding company, haswritten a
nice set of tipsfor smaller sites on how to scale a service on EC2 using a
small two person development team. Their service has a typical small scale
structure:PHP's Zend Framework 2Two m1.medium for web serversELB to split the
loadmaster/slave MySQL databaseSiege for load testingThe very sensible tips
that can handle 30,000 concurrent users per web server: Use PHP's APC feature.
APC is opcode cache that is "really a requirement in order for a website to
have a chance at performing well."Put everything that's not a .php request on
a CDN. Don't serve static files from your web server. They put everything on
S3 and use CloudFront as their CDN. Recent CloudFront problems have caused
them to serve directly from S3.Don't make connections to other servers in your
PHP code. Making connections to other servers blocks the server and slows down
processing. Use the APC key/value store for data storage and Varnish for

<p>Introduction: With the introduction ofRedisyour options in the key-value space just grew and
your choice of which to pick just got a lot harder. But when you think about
it, that's not a bad position to be in at all.Redis (REmote DIctionary Server)
-a key-value database. It's similar to memcached but the dataset is not
volatile, and values can be strings, exactly like in memcached, but also lists
and sets with atomic operations to push/pop elements.The key points are: open
source; speed (benchmarked performing 110,000 SET operations, and 81,000 GETs,
per second); persistence, but in an asynchronous way taking everything in
memory; support for higher level data structures and atomic operations.The
home page is well organized so I'll spare the excessive-copying-to-make-this-
post-longer. For a good overview of Redis take a look at Antonio Cangiano's
article:Introducing Redis: a fast key-value database.If you are looking at a
way to understand how Redis is different than something like Tokyo

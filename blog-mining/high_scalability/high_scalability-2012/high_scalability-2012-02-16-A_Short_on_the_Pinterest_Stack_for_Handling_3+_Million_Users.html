<p>Introduction: Film buffs will recognize Django as a classic 1966 spaghetti western that
spawned hundreds of imitators. Web heads will certainly first think of Django
as the classic Python based Web framework that has also spawned hundreds of
imitators and has become the gold standard framework for the web.Mike Malone,
who worked on Pownce, a blogging tool now owned by Six Apart, tells in this
very informative EuroDjangoCon presentation how Pownce scaled using Django in
the real world.I was surprised to learn how large Pounce was: hundreds of
requests/sec, thousands of DB operations/sec, millions of user relationships,
millions of notes, and terabytes of static data. Django has a lot of
functionality in the box to help you scale, but if you want to scale large it
turns out Django has some limitations and Mike tells you what these are and
also provides some code to get around them.Mike's talk-although Django
specific--will really help anyone creating applications on the web. There's a
lot of useful Dj</p><p>3 0.15694256 <a title="1193-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-09-12-Using_Varnish_for_Paywalls%3A_Moving_Logic_to_the_Edge.html">1321 high scalability-2012-09-12-Using Varnish for Paywalls: Moving Logic to the Edge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post fromPer Buer, founder and CEO of Varnish Software,
provider of Varnish Cache, an open source web application accelerator freely
available at varnish-cache.org. Varnish powers a lot of really big websites
worldwide.We at Varnish Software are all about speed. Varnish Cache is built
for speed. It executes its policy code more or less a thousand times faster
than your typical Java or PHP based application servers, mostly due to the
fact that the configuration is compiled into system call free machine
code.System calls require expensive context switches, stall the CPU and wreck
havoc in the CPU cache so avoiding them makes the code fly. There are strong
limitations on what kind of logic you can move into Varnish Cache, but the
logic that you do move there will run very fast.An example is using Varnish
for access control to serve access controlled content from the caching edge
layer.The Varnish PaywallWho gets to access your content? In a traditional
environment the cach</p><p>4 0.15017609 <a title="1193-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-21-Pinterest_Architecture_Update_-_18_Million_Visitors%2C_10x_Growth%2C12_Employees%2C_410_TB_of_Data.html">1248 high scalability-2012-05-21-Pinterest Architecture Update - 18 Million Visitors, 10x Growth,12 Employees, 410 TB of Data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There has been an update on Pinterest: Pinterest growth driven by Amazon cloud
scalability since our last post: A Short on the Pinterest Stack for Handling
3+ Million Users.With Pinterest we see a story very similar to that
ofInstagram. Huge growth, lots of users, lots of data, with remarkably few
employees, all on the cloud.While it's true that both Pinterest and Instagram
are not making great advances inscience and technology, that is more indicator
of the easy power of today's commodity environments rather than a sign of
Silicon Valley's lack of innovation. The numbers are so huge and the
valuations are so high we naturally want some sort of fundamental
technological revolution to underlie their growth. The revolution is more
subtle. It really is just that easy to attain such growth these days, if you
can execute on the right idea. Get used to it. This is the new normal.Here's
what Pinterest looks like today: 80 million objects stored in S3 with 410
terabytes of user data, 10x what</p><p>5 0.13492143 <a title="1193-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-03-Product%3A_nginx.html">314 high scalability-2008-05-03-Product: nginx</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Instagram is a free photo sharing and social networking service for your

over a year, they reached 150 million photos in August while amassing several

pastiche of different technologies and strategies. The team is small yet has
experience rapid growth riding the crest of a rising social and mobile wave,
it uses a hybrid of SQL and NoSQL, it uses a ton of open source projects, they

<p>Introduction: We've long known one of the virtues of the cloud is, through the magic of
services and automation, that systems can be shut or tuned down when not in
use. What may be surprising is how much money can be saved. This aspect of
cloudiness got a lot of pub atAWS re:Invent and is being rebranded under the
term Cost-Aware Architecture. Aninteresting examplewas given by Ryan Park,
Pinterest's technical operations lead:20% of their systems are shutdown after
hours in response to traffic loadsReserved instances are used for standard
traffic On-demand and spot instances are used to handle the elastic load
throughout the day. When more servers are needed for an auto-scaled service,
spot requests are opened and on-demand instances are started at the same time.
Most services are targeted to run at about 50% on-demand and 50% spot.Watchdog
processes continually check what's running. More instances are launched when
needed and terminated when not needed. If spot prices spike and spot instances

Sharing Service Instagram for $1 Billion. Just what is Facebook buying? Here's
a quick gloss I did a little over a year ago on a presentation Instagram gave
on their architecture. In that article I called Instagram's architecture the
"canonical description of an early stage startup in this era." Little did we
know how true that would turn out to be. If you want to learn how they did it
then don't take a picture, just keep on reading...  Instagram is a free photo

+ heavily-modified Django at the application layerTornado and (very
selectively) node.js as web-servers.  Memcached and membase / redis for
object- and logical-caching, respectively.  RabbitMQ as a message queue.
Nginx, HAproxy and Varnish for static-delivery and load-balancing.Persistent
data storage using MySQL.  MrJob on EMR for map-reduce.Git.Alex Popescu

<p>Introduction: One of the most popular and effective scalability strategies is to impose
limits (GAE Quotas,Fotolog,Facebook) as a means of protecting a website
against service destroyingtraffic spikes. Twitter will reportedlylimit the
number followersto 2,000 in order to thwart follow spam. This may also allow
Twitter to make some bank bygoing freemiumand charging for adding more
followers.Agree or disagree with Twitter's strategies, the more interesting
aspect for me is how do you introduce new policies into an already established
ecosystem?One approach is the big bang. Introduce all changes at once and let
everyone adjust. If users don't like it they can move on. The hope is,
however, most users won't be impacted by the changes and that those who are
will understand it's all for the greater good of their beloved service.
Casualties are assumed, but the damage will probably be minor.Now in Twitter's
case the people with the most followers tend to be opinion leaderswho shape
much of the blognet echo</p><p>3 0.67007643 <a title="1193-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-25-Relating_business%2C_systems_%26_technology_during_turbulent_time_-By_John_Zachman_.html">523 high scalability-2009-02-25-Relating business, systems & technology during turbulent time -By John Zachman </a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's hard to be a relational database lately. After years of faithful service
everywhere you look the world is turning against you:Recently at theNoSQL
conference150 revolutionaries met with their new anti-RDBMS arms suppliers.
And you know what happens when revolutionaries are motivated, educated,
funded, and well armed.The revolution has gone mainstream when Computerworld
writesNo to SQL? Anti-database movement gains steam. It's not just whispers
anymore, it's everywhere.And perennial revolutionary Michael Stonebraker runs
from blog to blog shouting theThe End of a DBMS Era (Might be Upon Us).
Relational vendors are selling legacy software, are 50x slower than other
alternatives, and that can not stand.The Greek Chorus onHacker Newssings of
anger and lies.Certainly some say stick with the past. It's your fault, you
aren't doing it right, give us another chance and all will be as it ever was.

was King.But i</p><p>5 0.64261293 <a title="1193-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-18-How_to_deal_with_an_I-O_bottleneck_to_disk%3F.html">251 high scalability-2008-02-18-How to deal with an I-O bottleneck to disk?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A site I'm working with has an I/O bottleneck.They're using a static server to
deliver all of the pictures/video content/zip downloads ecetera but now that
the bandwith out of that server is approaching 50Mbit/second the latency on
serving small files has increased to become unacceptable.I'm curious how other
people have dealt with this situation.Seperating into two different servers
would require a significant change to the sites architecutre (because the
premise is that all uploads go into one server, all subdirectorie are created
in one directory, etc.) and may not really solve the problem.</p><p>6 0.62771076 <a title="1193-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-24-Advertise.html">287 high scalability-2008-03-24-Advertise</a></p>

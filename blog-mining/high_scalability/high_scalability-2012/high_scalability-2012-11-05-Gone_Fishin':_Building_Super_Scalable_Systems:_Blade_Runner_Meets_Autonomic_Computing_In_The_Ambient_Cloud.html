now, but c</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 The basic argument that we'll be exploring in this article goes like this:As more of the world of people and things come on-line and become interconnected, the driving force for applications will be the need to acquire the expertise and resources necessary to planet-scale at an affordable cost. [sent-65, score-0.519]
</p><p>2 To make the diverse and the continuously changing set of compute resources in the Ambient Cloud available to applications in real-time, compute resources will be traded in ways similar to how automated trading works in financial markets. [sent-73, score-0.715]
</p><p>3 Creating planet-scaling applications is so resource intensive, and web applications provide such a low profit margin, that applications will be forced to be opportunistic and make use of resources from wherever they can be found. [sent-76, score-0.56]
</p><p>4 By applications becoming black boxes that operate in a global Ambient Cloud composed of wildly different legal and political situations, applications begin to form a separate class of entity, with their own need for economic and political representation. [sent-77, score-0.519]
</p><p>5 Some will reside in datacenters, but compute resources can be anywhere, not just in the datacenter, we'll actually see the bulk of compute resources live outside of datacenters in the future. [sent-170, score-0.569]
</p><p>6 Once found the application will have to reorganize on the fly to use whatever new resources it has found and let go of whatever resources it doesn't have access to anymore. [sent-174, score-0.41]
</p><p>7 In the past applications were designed to make use of fixed cost resources (racks, servers, SANs, switches, energy etc) that were incrementally increased in largish allotments acquired through an onerous management processes. [sent-194, score-0.365]
</p><p>8 Opportunities for Loss in Algorithm ChoicesThis quaint and anachronistic static view of the world changes completely under cloud computing because of one innovation: variable cost usage-based pricing. [sent-198, score-0.345]
</p><p>9 We are, however, starting to see multiple cloud options, we are starting to see multiple SaaS offerings for services like cloud storage, and we are still in just the very earliest stages of the Ambient Cloud. [sent-230, score-0.357]
</p><p>10 A rich and varied supply of compute resources on which to base a market is still in the future, but it is under construction. [sent-231, score-0.348]
</p><p>11 Each of us will have a surprisingly large pool of resources to put into the market: smart phones, smart houses, smart appliances, smart cars, smart prosthetics, PCs, laptops, energy, and so on. [sent-242, score-0.627]
</p><p>12 Step up a level and companies will have smart buildings, smart fleets, smart networks, smart sensors, datacenters, and so on to contribute into the pool. [sent-243, score-0.396]
</p><p>13 The muscular forces of globalization and the proliferation of things and people into dense social networks will only drive a few specialized applications into the arms of a few dominant platform vendors. [sent-471, score-0.356]
</p><p>14 Let's compare the collective power of PCs + smartphones + smart grid + smart everything + BANs with the traditional cloud: it's trillions against many 10s of millions. [sent-648, score-0.391]
</p><p>15 Plura is an excellent example of how these resources can be used as a compute grid, the next step is think of all these resources can be used as an application runtime. [sent-676, score-0.375]
</p><p>16 The wide variety of different clouds and different compute resources will make it difficult to come up with a true standardization layer. [sent-765, score-0.356]
</p><p>17 Gordon is asystem architecture for data-centric applications that combines low-power processors, flash memory, and datacentric programming systems to improve performance for data-centric applications while reducing power consumption. [sent-884, score-0.391]
</p><p>18 The reason why I think a market is so critical to the Ambient Cloud is because I think it's the only way to make the dynamic pool of exponentially growing compute resources available to applications. [sent-1029, score-0.404]
</p><p>19 Since the resources are dynamic there needs to be some sort of exchange set up to allow applications to know when new resources become available and search for existing resources. [sent-1031, score-0.513]
</p><p>20 As crazy as this may sound, I think this is also the direction applications will need follow to survive in a complex world of billions of compute devices. [sent-1041, score-0.358]

big, complex, and adaptive:Many clouds.Many servers.Many operating
systems.Many languages.Many storage services.Many database services.Many
software services.Many adjunct human networks (like Mechanical Turk).Many fast

(simple request-response, live streaming, computationally complex, sensor
driven, memory intensive, storage intensive, monolithic, decomposable,
etc).Many legal jurisdictions. Don't want to perform a function on Patriot Act
"protected" systems then move the function elsewhere.Many SLAs.Many data

"seats" to maximize profit using multi-variate time sensitive pricing
models.Many competitive products. The need to defend your territory never

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade

of resources as residing primarily in datacenters. Given the fast pace of
innovation we will likely see compute resources become pervasive. Some will

datacenters in the future.Given the diversity of compute resources it's
reasonable to assume they won't be homogeneous or conform to a standard API.

specialized service interfaces to build applications that are adaptive enough

<p>Introduction: And now for something completely different, brought to you by David Ackley and
Daniel Cannon in their playfully thought provoking paper: Pursue robust
indefinite scalability, wherein they try to take a fresh look at neural
networks, starting from scratch.What is this strange thing calledindefinite
scalability? They sound like words that don't really go together:Indefinite
scalability is the property that the design can support open-ended
computational growth without substantial re-engineering, in as strict as sense
as can be managed. By comparison, many computer, algorithm, and network
designs -- even those that address scalability -- are only finitely scalable
because their scalability occurs within some finite space. For example, an in-
core sorting algorithm for a 32 bit machine can only scale to billions of
numbers before address space is exhausted and then that algorithm must be re-
engineered.Our idea is to expose indefinitely scalable computational power to
programmers using rei</p><p>same-blog 2 0.96047121 <a title="1355-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: InA Brief History of the Internetit was revealed that the Internet wasbased on
the idea that there would be multiple independent networks of rather arbitrary
design. The Internet as we now know it embodies a key underlying technical
idea, namely that of open architecture networking. In this approach, the
choice of any individual network technology was not dictated by a particular
network architecture but rather could be selected freely by a provider and
made to interwork with the other networks through a meta-level
"Internetworking Architecture".  With the cloud we are in the same situation
today, just a layer or two higher up the stack. We have independent clouds
that we would like to connect and work seamlessly together, preferably with
the ease at which we currently connect nodes to a network and networks to the
Internet. This technology seems to be called theIntercloud: an interconnected
global "cloud ofclouds" as apposed to theInternetwhich is a "network of
networks."Vinton Cerf,p</p><p>6 0.95052874 <a title="1355-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-01-PRISM%3A_The_Amazingly_Low_Cost_of_%C2%ADUsing_BigData_to_Know_More_About_You_in_Under_a_Minute.html">1485 high scalability-2013-07-01-PRISM: The Amazingly Low Cost of ­Using BigData to Know More About You in Under a Minute</a></p>

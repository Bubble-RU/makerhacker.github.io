<p>Introduction: Martin Thompson , a high-performance technology geek, has written an awesome post,   Fun with my-Channels Nirvana and Azul Zing . In it Martin   shows the process and techniques he used to take an existing messaging product, written in Java, and increase throughput by 32X and reduce latency by  20X. The article is very well written with lots of interesting details that make it well worth reading.  
   The Techniques   
 The techniques are a good mix of Java independent approaches, things you may have heard of before, things you probably haven’t heard of  before, and Java specific heroics. The obvious winning technique is to create a lock free flow through the system. This shouldn’t be surprising as Martin teaches what sounds like a really good    lock-free concurrency course   .  
  
  Do not use locks in the main transaction flow because they cause context switches, and therefore latency and unpredictable jitter.

<p>Introduction: If you are interested in future foward OS designs then you might find  Akaros  worth a look. It's an operating system designed for many-core architectures and large-scale SMP systems, with the goals of:
  
 Providing better support for parallel and high-performance applications 
 Scaling the operating system to a large number of cores  
  
A more indepth explanation of the motiviation behind Akaros can be found in  Improving Per-Node Efﬁciency in the Datacenter with NewOS Abstractions  by Barret Rhoden, Kevin Klues, David Zhu, and Eric Brewer.
 
The abstract:
  We believe datacenters can beneﬁt from more focus on per-node efﬁciency, performance, and predictability, versus the more common focus so far on scalability to a large number of nodes. Improving per-node efﬁciency decreases costs and fault recovery because fewer nodes are required for the same amount of work. We believe that the use of complex, general-purpose operating systems is a key contributing factor to these inefﬁciencies</p><p>4 0.15242957 <a title="1231-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-16-Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_in_the_Ambient_Cloud.html">750 high scalability-2009-12-16-Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud</a></p>

     Amazing microscope image of a carnivorous bladderwort    
  How many drones would it take to replace Santa?  With a fleet of some 80 million or so F-16 drones the entire worldwide delivery could be completed in just over eight hours. Impressive, but a world without Rudolf is not a world I wish to contemplate.

  Gideon Lewis-Kraus :Â As the engineer and writer Alex Payne put it, these startups represent â&euro;&oelig;the field offices of a large distributed workforce assembled by venture capitalists and their associate institutions,â&euro;? doing low-overhead, low-risk R&D; for five corporate giants. In such a system, the real disillusionment isnâ&euro;&trade;t the discovery that youâ&euro;&trade;re unlikely to become aÂ billionaire; itâ&euro;&trade;s the realization that your feeling of autonomy is a fantasy, and that the vast majority of you have been set up to fail by design.

  @etherealmind : You can dramatically improve blog performance by blocking Amazon IP address ranges. Tells you how much information mining is occurring. 
  Randy Bias : Choice is possible only when there’s architectural consistency between public and private cloud infrastructure. Those who focus only on API compatibility are either confused or intentionally misleading people. There is NO API COMPATIBILITY without architectural compatibility. 
  Nassim Nicholas Taleb : Everything that is fragile and still in existence (that is, unbroken), will be harmed more by a certain stressor of intensity X than by k times a stressor of intensity X/k, up to the point of breaking.</p><p>6 0.81813073 <a title="1231-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-12-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_October_12%2C_2012.html">1339 high scalability-2012-10-12-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For October 12, 2012</a></p>

 Google+:  90 million users ;  Internet 2011 : 2.1 billion Internet users, 1 trillion YouTube views, 5.9 billion mobile subscriptions; Fusion-io:  One Billion IOPS ; 12 atoms:  size of IBM's new memory bit ; 32 Million:  Stack monthly visitors ; Gmail:  350 Million Users ; TimTebow:  1.5 million Tweets  
 Quotable Quotes:           
 
  Similarity  : There is no canonical schema anymore. Instead you should ask: What high-volume queries will I need to serve with my data? Then work backwards from there. 
  @kvirjee  : Dis/Agree? -- "there is no problem but scalability, and architecture is its solution" 
  @robpegoraro  : Eternal vigilance can be crowdsourced.

 Quotable quotes:            
 
  Markus Frind :   Scaling is not very fun these days.  
  Mike Krieger : Scaling is like replacing all components on a car while driving it at 100 mph.  
  @jaykreps : We built servers that could handle 100k connections by building servers that could handle 10k connections and waiting a decade. 
  @RichExperiences : Twitter alone generates more than 7 terabytes of data every day, Facebook 10 TB...

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my article  Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.   
 
As I was writing  an article  on the architecture of the  Storm Botnet , I couldn't help but notice the deep similarity of how Storm works and changes we're seeing in the evolution of political systems. In particular, the rise of the  virtual-state . As crazy as this may sound, I think this is also the direction applications will need follow to survive in a complex world of billions of compute devices.
 
You may have already heard of  virtual corporations .  Virtual corporations are companies with limited office space, a distributed workforce, and production facilities located wherever it is profitable to locate them. The idea is to stay lean and compete using the  rapid development and introduction of new products into high value-added markets . If you spot a market opportunity with a small time window, building your own factories and hiring and engine</p><p>5 0.94073641 <a title="1231-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-24-11_Secrets_of_a_Cloud_Scale_Consultant_That_They_Dont%27_Want_You_to_Know.html">428 high scalability-2008-10-24-11 Secrets of a Cloud Scale Consultant That They Dont' Want You to Know</a></p>
<p>Introduction: OK, there is no "they" and "they" wouldn't care if you knew anyway. After all, this isn't a blog about really important stuff like investing, acne cures, or cheap natural cleansing products.   But the secrets are real. Super cloud scaling consultant Kent Langley has  put together a comprehensive checklist  to consider when developing for the cloud:

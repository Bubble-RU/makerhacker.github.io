<p>Introduction: The ever amazingslime moldis not the only way to solve complex compute
problems without performing calculations. There is another:soap film.
Unfortunately for soap film it isn't nearly as photogenic as slime mold, all
we get are boring looking pictures, but the underlying idea is still
fascinating and ten times less spooky.As a quick introduction we'll lean on
Long Ouyang, who has really straightforward  explanation of how soap film
works inApproaching P=NP: Can Soap Bubbles Solve The Steiner Tree Problem In
Polynomial.It's computers, so playing the role of the motivating graph problem
we have theSteiner tree problem, which Ouyang explains as:Find the minimum
spanning tree for a bunch of vertices, given that you can add additional
points.Soap helps solve this problem because:Soap, in water, acts a
surfactant, which decreases the surface tension in water.This acts to minimize
the surface energy of the liquid.This should minimize surface area (graph
weight), and solve the problem.Dip two</p><p>6 0.084076792 <a title="1225-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-05-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_5%2C_2013.html">1436 high scalability-2013-04-05-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 5, 2013</a></p>

the story of how it also foreshadowed changes to come as an early version of

being laid atranscontental telegraphsystem was also being constructed.
Telegraph lines were installed parallel to the tracks making instant
communication available across the continent, faster than any horse could
ride.With the transalantic cable system information could quickly span
continents in minutes:The miles of American telegraph grew from 40 in 1846 to

analyze the bottlenecks preventing websites and blogs from loading quickly and
how to resolve them.80-90% of the end-user response time is spent on the
frontend, so it makes sense to concentrate efforts there before heroically
rewriting the backend. Take a shower before buying a Porsche, if you know what
I mean. Steve Souders, author ofHigh Performance WebsitesandYslow, hasten more

<p>Introduction: Update: Organism without a brain creates external memories for navigationshows
slime mold is even cooler than originally thought, storing a record of where
it's been using slime: The authors conclude, the slime isn't just the mold's
calling card. Instead, it's a way of marking the environment so that the
organism can sense where it's been, and not expend effort on searches that
won't pay off. Although the situation isn't an exact parallel, the authors
make a comparison to the pheromone trails used by ants.  InAfter Life: The
Strange Science Of Decaythere's a truly incredible sequence of gorgeously shot
video showing howcreeping slime moldsolves mazes and performs other other
amazing feats of computation. Take a look at what simple one celled organisms
can do:The whole video is really well done and shockingly revelatory. It's the
story of decay, how atoms created during the Big Bang and through countless
supernova explosions are continually rearranged and reused by the complex

<p>Introduction: To continue the graph theme Google has got into the act and released
information onPregel. Pregel does not appear to be a new type of potato chip.
Pregel is instead a scalable infrastructure......to mine a wide range of
graphs. In Pregel, programs are expressed as a sequence of iterations. In each
iteration, a vertex can, independently of other vertices, receive messages
sent to it in the previous iteration, send messages to other vertices, modify
its own and its outgoing edges' states, and mutate the graph's
topology.Currently, Pregel scales to billions of vertices and edges, but this
limit will keep expanding. Pregel's applicability is harder to quantify, but
so far we haven't come across a type of graph or a practical graph computing
problem which is not solvable with Pregel. It computes over large graphs much
faster than alternatives, and the application programming interface is easy to
use. Implementing PageRank, for example, takes only about 15 lines of code.

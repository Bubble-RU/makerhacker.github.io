<p>Introduction: In  MemSQL Architecture  we learned one of the core strategies MemSQL uses to achieve their need for speed is lock-free skip lists. Skip lists are used to efficiently handle range queries. Making the skip-lists lock-free helps eliminate contention and make writes fast. 
 
If this all sounds a little pie-in-the-sky then here's a very good paper on the subject that might help make it clearer:  A Provably Correct Scalable Concurrent Skip List .
 
From the abstract:
  We propose a new concurrent skip list algorithm distinguished by a combination of simplicity and scalability. The algorithm employs optimistic synchronization, searching without acquiring locks, followed by short lock-based validation before adding or removing nodes. It also logically removes an item before physically unlinking it. Unlike some other concurrent skip list algorithms, this algorithm preserves the skiplist properties at all times, which facilitates reasoning about its correctness. Experimental evidence shows that</p><p>3 0.15619281 <a title="1302-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-30-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_30%2C_2013.html">1509 high scalability-2013-08-30-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 30, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The abstract for the talk given by Bob Ippolito, co-founder and CTO of Mochi Media, Inc:
   Building large systems on top of a traditional single-master RDBMS data storage layer is no longer good enough. This talk explores the landscape of new technologies available today to augment your data layer to improve performance and reliability. Is your application a good fit for caches, bloom filters, bitmap indexes, column stores, distributed key/value stores, or document databases? Learn how they work (in theory and practice) and decide for yourself.   
Bob does an excellent job highlighting different products and the key concepts to understand when pondering the wide variety of new database offerings. It's unlikely you'll be able to say oh, this is the database for me after watching the presentation, but you will be much better informed on your options. And I imagine slightly confused as to what to do :-)  An interesting observation in the talk is that the more robust products are internal</p><p>5 0.14812025 <a title="1302-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles_with_Sharding_-_What_can_we_learn_from_the_Foursquare_Incident%3F.html">920 high scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles with Sharding - What can we learn from the Foursquare Incident?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great scalability solution, but caching also  comes with problems .  Sharding  is a great scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in a  post-mortem  about their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database Foursquare uses, also contributed their  post-mortem  of what went wrong too.
 
Now that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?
 
First, like for  Facebook , huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in a pretty cool industry.
 
Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built by a small group of people, under immense pressure</p><p>6 0.14652306 <a title="1302-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Are_Cloud_Based_Memory_Architectures_the_Next_Big_Thing%3F.html">538 high scalability-2009-03-16-Are Cloud Based Memory Architectures the Next Big Thing?</a></p>

 Quotable Quotes:                                            
 
  Seymour Cray : A supercomputer is a device for turning compute-bound problems into IO-bound problems. 
  Robert Sapolsky : And why is self-organization so beautiful to my atheistic self? Because if complex, adaptive systems don’t require a blue print, they don’t require a blue print maker. If they don’t require lightning bolts, they don’t require Someone hurtling lightning bolts. 
  @swardley : Asked for a history of PaaS? From memory, public launch - Zimki ('06), BungeeLabs ('06), Heroku ('07), GAE ('08), CloudFoundry ('11) ... 
  @neil_conway : If you're designing scalable systems, you should understand backpressure and build mechanisms to support it.

  David Krakauer : We fail to make intelligent machines because engineering is about putting together stupid components to make smart objects. Evolution is about putting together smart components into intelligent aggregates. Your brain is like an ecosystem of organisms. It's not like a circuit of gates. 
  @spyced : At this point if you depend on EBS for critical services you're living in denial and I can't help you.  
  @skilpat : TIL Friedrich Engels, not Leslie Lamport, invented logical clocks in a 1844 letter to Karl Marx

  Randy Bias : Choice is possible only when there’s architectural consistency between public and private cloud infrastructure. Those who focus only on API compatibility are either confused or intentionally misleading people. There is NO API COMPATIBILITY without architectural compatibility. 
  Nassim Nicholas Taleb : Everything that is fragile and still in existence (that is, unbroken), will be harmed more by a certain stressor of intensity X than by k times a stressor of intensity X/k, up to the point of breaking.</p><p>6 0.82080144 <a title="1302-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-06-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_December_6th%2C_2013.html">1559 high scalability-2013-12-06-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For December 6th, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A conjunction of a few new technologies may trigger disruptive changes in the future. This observation was prompted by a talk  Steve Perlman  gave at the Columbia Engineering School:  Benjamin Button, Cloud Everything and Why Shannon's Law Isn't . In it he covers a set of technologies that at first may seem unrelated, but turn out to be deeply related after all, culminating in a realization of the long talked about vision of an application utility, where all applications are hosted and run out of the cloud. 
 
First Perlman talks about the realistic human rendering technology developed at Rearden, his research incubator company. This technology was developed over many years and is the secret behind the wonderful effects found in movies like  Benjamin Button . It is now being used in many other films, and promises to revolutionize film making, possibly even replacing actors with computers, in real-time.
 
The next invention at Rearden is  OnLive , a cloud based gaming technology for pla</p><p>2 0.95233691 <a title="1302-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-07-Can_you_profit_from_the_coming_Content_Delivery_Network_wars%3F.html">60 high scalability-2007-08-07-Can you profit from the coming Content Delivery Network wars?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Playing like the big boys may be getting cheaper. The big boys, like  YouTube , farm the serving of their most popular videos to a third party CDN. A lot of people were surprised YouTube didn't serve all their content themselves, but it makes sense. It allows them to keep up with demand without a large hit for infrastructure build out, much like leasing computers instead of buying them.
   
 The problem has been CDNs are expensive.  Om Malik reports in  Akamai & the CDN Price Wars  that may be changing. CDN service could be becoming affordable enough that you might consider using them as part of your scaling strategy.    Akamai , once the clear leader in the CDN field, is facing strong competition from the likes of Limelight Networks, Level 3, Internap, CDNetworks, Panther Express and EdgeCast Networks.  This  commoditization  may be bad for their stock prices, but it's good for website builders looking for new scaling strategies. EdgeCast, for example, passes on the cost savings when</p><p>3 0.94199961 <a title="1302-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-13-Automation_on_AWS_with_Ruby_and_Puppet.html">1058 high scalability-2011-06-13-Automation on AWS with Ruby and Puppet</a></p>

 Urbandive  is an immersive view service launched by the  French YellowPages  which allows you to travel in cities in France thanks to a 360° view. Urbandive focuses on providing high definition pictures and accurate professional and social content. One of the biggest jobs was to enable a fast scalable architecture, because it was really difficult to forecast the traffic load at production time. Traffic load may be influenced if the service receives attention from users as a result of advertising.

 Quotable Quotes:                                        
 
  @tapbot_paul : The 2 computers on the Curiosity rover are RAD750 based, they are approximately 1/10th the speed of an iPhone 4s and “only” cost $200k each. 
  @merv : #cassandra12 Why @adrianco loves what he's doing: "You are no longer IO-bound, you’re CPU bound, like you’re supposed to be." 
  @maxtaco : Garbage collection solves a minuscule %age of bugs, that are non-critical (memleaks? big deal!) and easy to find and fix. At a HUGE expense. 
 
 
  @merv : #cassandra12 @eddie_satterly describing $1M savings in first year migrating from MS SQL Server with SAN to Cassandra solution - w more data.

 Quotable Quotes:       
 
  @zateriosystems : thinking about scalability?, are you OK to double your capacity in one week?, a startup should be ready...ready to jump. 
  @sklacy : Maybe what I should have said is "Design for scalability, deploy without it." 
  @MikeHale : Scalability is customer 2000 having the same experience as customer 1 #sqlsat67 
  @LusciousPear : The meaning of #NoSQL is shut up 
  @deobrat : The biggest bottleneck to scalability are ignorant developers. Most don't even try saving extra CPU cycles or memory bytes :( 
  @w_westendorp : . @ijansch : Cloud computing is like outsourcing your scalability problems 
  @edyavno : Billy Newport essentially just affirmed the theme I've been propagating: "Distributed Caching is the enterprise NoSQL" #strangeloop #nosql 
  @monkchips : HP CEO Leo Apotheker says "relational databases are becoming less and less relevant to the future stack"

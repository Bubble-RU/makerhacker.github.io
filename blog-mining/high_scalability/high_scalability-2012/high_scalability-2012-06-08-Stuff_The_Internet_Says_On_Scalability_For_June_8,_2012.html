<p>Introduction: With Amazon     announcing new High I/O 2TB SSD instances    the age of SSD has almost arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on demand rate the   price per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:   27 cents ($27K/100K IOPS) per vs    $1.25 for disk   .     With the obvious benefits of giant SSD machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it’s interesting to consider: what architecture decisions might you make differently in the future? 
   More Headroom for Vertical Scaling Simplifies Everything   
 The beauty of higher hardware performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This has always been the allure of    vertical scaling    and is well realized by SSDs through a combination of high throughput, low latencies, and just as important, high densities.    We have a few earl</p><p>3 0.15056016 <a title="1261-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-12-YouTube_Architecture.html">274 high scalability-2008-03-12-YouTube Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2:   YouTube Reaches One Billion Views Per Day .  That’s at least 11,574 views per second, 694,444 views per minute, and 41,666,667 views per hour.     Update:   YouTube: The Platform . YouTube adds a new rich set of APIs in order to become your video platform leader--all for free. Upload, edit, watch, search, and comment on video from your own site without visiting YouTube. Compose your site internally from APIs because you'll need to expose them later anyway.   YouTube grew incredibly fast, to over 100 million video views per day, with only a handful of people responsible for scaling the site. How did they manage to deliver all that video to all those users? And how have they evolved since being acquired by Google?

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.

  @jimplush : Google spent 2.3 billion on infrastructure in Q1. Remember that when you say you want to be "the Google of something" 
 Clay Shirky: I think one of the things that happened to the P2P market for infrastructure is that users preference for predictable pricing vs resource-sensitive pricing is so overwhelming that they will overpay to anyone who can promise flat prices. And because the logic of centralization vs decentralization is so price sensitive, I don't think there is any logical reason to assume a broadly stable class of apps, separate from c</p><p>5 0.82108706 <a title="1261-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-10-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_10%2C_2012.html">1190 high scalability-2012-02-10-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 10, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In update to  Prismatic Architecture - Using Machine Learning on Social Networks to Figure Out What You Should Read on the Web , Jason Wolfe, even in the face of deadening fatigue from long nights spent getting their iPhone app out, has gallantly agreed to talk a little more about Primatic's approach to Machine Learning.
 
Documents and users are two areas where Prismatic applies ML (machine learning):
  ML on Documents   
 Given an HTML document:Â         
 
 learn how to extract the main text of the page (rather than the sidebar, footer, comments, etc), its title, author, best images, etc 
 determine features for relevance (e.g., what the article is about, topics, etc.) 
 
 
 The setup for most of these tasks is pretty typical. Models are trained using big batch jobs on other machines that read data from s3, save the learned parameter files to s3, and then read (and periodically refresh) the models from s3 in the ingest pipeline.  
 All of the data that flows out of the system can be</p><p>2 0.94051027 <a title="1261-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-27-Heroku_Emergency_Strategy%3A_Incident_Command_System_and_8_Hour_Ops_Rotations_for_Fresh_Minds.html">1030 high scalability-2011-04-27-Heroku Emergency Strategy: Incident Command System and 8 Hour Ops Rotations for Fresh Minds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  Resolved: Widespread Application Outage  ,  Heroku  tells their story of how they dealt with the   Amazon outage . While taking 100% responsibility for the downtime, they also shared a number of the strategies they used to bring their service back to full working order.
 
 One of  Heroku's  most interesting strategies wasn't a technical hack at all, but how they consciously went about deploying their Ops personnel in response to the emergency. An outline of their strategy is: 
 
 
  
 Monitoring systems immediately alerted Ops to the problem.  
 An on-call engineer applied triage logic to the problem and classified it as serious, which caused the on-call  Incident Commander  to be woken out of restful slumber.  
  The  IC  contacted  AWS . They were in constant contact with their  AWS  representative and worked closely with  AWS  to solve problems.

<p>Introduction: (Please bare with me, I'm a new, passionate, confident and terrified programmer :D )     Background:   I'm pre-launch and 1 year into the development of my application.  My target is to be able to eventually handle millions of registered users with 5-10% of them concurrent.  Up to this point I've used auto-increment to assign unique identifiers to rows.  I am now considering switching to a non-sequential strategy.  Oh, I'm using the LAMP configuration.     My reasons for avoiding auto-increment:   1.  Complicates replication when scaling horizontally.  Risk of collision is significant (when running multiple masters).  Note: I've read the other entries in this forum that relate to ID generation and there have been some great suggestions -- including a strategy that uses auto-increment in a way that avoids this pitfall... That said, I'm still nervous about it.   2.  Potential bottleneck when retrieving/assigning IDs -- IDs assigned at the database.     My reasons for being nervous about</p><p>4 0.93668485 <a title="1261-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-23-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_23%2C_2013.html">1506 high scalability-2013-08-23-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 23, 2013</a></p>

 Quotable Quotes:                                              
 
  @chaliy : Today I learned that I do not understand how #azure scaling works, instance scale does not affect requests/sec I can load. 
  @Lariar : Note how crazy this is. An international launch would have been a huge deal. Now it's just another thing you do. 
  smacktoward : The problem with relying on donations is that people don't make donations. 
  @toddhoffious : Programming is a tool built by logical positivists to solve the problems of idealists and pragmatists. We have a fundamental mismatch here.

<p>Introduction: Disqus - Scaling the Worlds Largest Django App.  Interesting overview of a commenting system with 75 million comments and 250 million visitors. Lots of good details on how they partition their database, testing, continuous integration, feature switches, caching, delayed signals, and more. 
 
  Things I learnt tracking a billion events in 24 hours : Know your host, Scaling isn't just servers, My servers need to talk to me more, Kill switches for users, What you don't know is the problem, Don't mix server roles, Know your most important users outside of your site.

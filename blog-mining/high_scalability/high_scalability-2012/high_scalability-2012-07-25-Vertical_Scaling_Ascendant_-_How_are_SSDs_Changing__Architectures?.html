<p>Introduction: Planning your next buildout and thinking SSDs are still far in the future?
Still too expensive, too low density. Hard disks are cheap, familiar, and
store lots of stuff. In this short and entertaining video Wikia's Artur
Bergmanwants to change your mind about SSDs. SSDs are for today, get with the
math already.Here's Artur's logic:Wikia is all SSD in production. The new
Wikia file servers have a theoretical read rate of ~10GB/sec sequential,
6GB/sec random and 1.2 million IOPs. If you can't do math or love the past,
you love spinning rust. If you are awesome you love SSDs.SSDs are cheaper than
drives using the most relevant metric: $/GB/IOPS. 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS and one
hard drive is 180 IOPS. Need 1 SSD instead of 50 hard drives.With 8 million
files there's a 9 minute fsck. Full backup in 12 minutes (X-25M based).4

<p>Introduction: Update:Final Thoughts on SSD and MySQL AKA Battleship Spinn3r. Tips on how to
make your database 10x faster using solid state drives. Potential exists for
100x speedup.Solid-state drives(SSDs) are the holy grail of storage. The
promise of RAM speeds and hard disk like persistence have for years driven us
crazy with power user lust, but they've stayed tantalizingly just out of
reach. Always too expensive, too small, and oddly too slow. Has that changed?
Can you now miraculously have your cake and eat it too? Can you now have it
both ways? Is balancing work with family life now as easy as tripping over a
terabyte drive?In a pioneering series of blog articles Kevin Burton conducts
original research on next generation SSD drives in real world configurations.

runsTripAdvisor's Technical Operations team, Luke and Victor interned on his
team this past summer. This post is introduced byAndy Gelfond, TripAdvisor's
head of engineering.It's been a little over a year since our last post about
theTripAdvisor architecture. It has been an exciting year. Our business and
team continues to grow, we are now an independent public company, and we have
continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown -
we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work
across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:56M visitors per
month350M+ pages requests a day120TB+ of warehouse data running on a large
Hadoop cluster, and quickly growingWe also had a very successful college
intern program that brought on over 60 interns this past summer, all who were

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byBrian Bulkowski, CTO and co-founder ofAerospike, a
leading clustered NoSQL database, has worked in the area of high performance
commodity systems since 1989.This blog post will tell you exactly how to build
a multi-terabyte high throughput datacenter server. A fast, reliable multi-
terrabyte data tier can be used for recent behavior (messages, tweets, plays,
actions), or anywhere that today you use Redis or Memcache.You need to
know:Which SSDs workWhich chassis workHow to configure your RAID cardsIntel's
SATA solutions - combined with a high capacity storage server like the Dell
R720xd and a host bus adapter based on the LSI 2208, and a Flash optimized
database likeAerospike, enables high throughput and low latency.In a wide
configuration, with 12 to 20 drives per 2U server, individual servers can

Yes, it Delivers More Consistent and Higher Performance IO</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Amazon created a whole new class of service with theirProvisioned IOPSfor RDS,
EBS, and DynamoDB. The idea is simple. If you want more performance, you turn
a dial up. If you want less, you turn a dial down. A beautifully simple model.
You pay for the performance you want, which is different than their previous
cloud model, where performance varied, but you paid only for what you used.
The question: Do these higher priced services really work better?Rodrigo
Campos put this question to the test (only for EBS) by running a benchmark he
describes inIOMelt Provisioned IOPS EBS Benchmark Results - December 2012.The
result?Yes, AWS Provisioned IOPS Volumes Really Deliver More Consistent and
Higher Performance IO:It is clear that the provisioned IOPS EBS volumes offer
a huge performance upgrade when compared to the non-optimized EBS volumes, but
as data has to be spread among more underlying disks or systems, it seems that
the volume is increasingly more susceptible to performance

one can achieve higher performance by creating read-only and write-only
databases where possible.I have read the comments and tried unsuccessfully to
find more information on the net about this. I still do not understand the
concept. Can someone explain it in more detail, as well as recommend resources
for further investigation? (Are there books written specifically about this
technique?) I think it is a very important issue, because databases are
oftentimes the bottleneck.</p><p>2 0.94866794 <a title="1291-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-30-Rather_small_site_architecture..html">312 high scalability-2008-04-30-Rather small site architecture.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: With Amazonannouncing new High I/O 2TB SSD instancesthe age of SSD has almost
arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on
demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on
demand rate theprice per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:27 cents
($27K/100K IOPS) per vs$1.25 for disk.With the obvious benefits of giant SSD
machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it's interesting to consider: what
architecture decisions might you make differently in the future?More Headroom
for Vertical Scaling Simplifies EverythingThe beauty of higher hardware
performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows
developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This
has always been the allure ofvertical scalingand is well realized by SSDs
through a combination of high throughput, low latencies, and just as
important, high densities.We have a few early examples showing the performance

<p>Introduction: Cloud computing promises a number of advantages for the deployment of data-
intensive applications. Most prominently, these include reducing cost with a
pay-as-you-go pricing model and (virtually) unlimited throughput by adding
servers if the workload increases. At theSystems Group, ETH Zurich, we did an
extensiveend-to-end performance studyto compare the major cloud offerings
regarding their ability to fulfill these promises and their implied cost.The
focus of the work is on transaction processing (i.e., read and update work-
loads), rather than analytics workloads. We used theTPC-W, a standardized
benchmark simulating a Web-shop, as the baseline for our comparison. The TPC-W
defines that users are simulated through emulated browsers (EB) and issue page
requests, called web-interactions (WI), against the system. As a major
modification to the benchmark, we constantly increase the load from 1 to 9000
simultaneous users to measure the scalability and cost variance of the system.

up with an interesting checklist of general themes from what he was seeing.

He uses this framework to think about the larger picture and where PostgreSQL
stands in its progression.Make use of the academic literature.Inventing your
own way to do something is fine, but at least consider the possibility that
someone smarter than you has thought about this problem before.Failures are
inevitable, so plan for them.  Try to minimize the possibility of cascading
failures, and plan in advance how you can operate in degraded mode if disaster
(or the Slashdot effect) strikes.Disk technology matters.Drive firmware bugs
are common and nightmarish, and you can expect very limited help from the
manufacturer, especially if the drive is billed as consumer-grade rather than
enterprise-grade. SSDs can save you a lot of money, both because a given

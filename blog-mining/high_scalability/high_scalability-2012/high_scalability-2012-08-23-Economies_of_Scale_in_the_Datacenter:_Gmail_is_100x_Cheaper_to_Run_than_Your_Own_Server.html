<p>Introduction: After Google  cut prices  on their Google Cloud Platform Amazon quickly followed with their own  price cuts . Even more interesting is what the future holds for pricing. The near future looks great. After that? We'll see.
 
Adrian Cockcroft highlights that Google thinks  prices should follow  Moore’s law, which means we should expect prices to halve every 18-24 months.
 
That's good news. Greater cost certainty means you can make much more aggressive build out plans. With the savings you can hire more people, handle more customers, and add those media rich features you thought you couldn't afford. Design is directly related to costs.
 
Without Google competing with Amazon there's little doubt the price reduction curve would be much less favorable.
 
As a late cloud entrant Google is now in a customer acquisition phase, so they are willing to pay for customers, which means lower prices are an acceptable cost of doing business.

<p>Introduction: In  Stack Overflow Architecture Update - Now At 95 Million Page Views A Month , a commenter expressed surprise about Stack Overflow's backup strategy: 
  

Backup is to disk for fast retrieval and to tape for historical archiving.

  
The comment was:
  

Really? People still do this? I know some organizations invested a tremendous amount in automated, robotic tape backup, but seriously, a site founded in 2008 is backing up to tape?

   The Case of the Missing Gmail Accounts  
I admit that I was surprised at this strategy too. In this age of copying data to disk three times for safety, I also wondered if tape backups were still necessary? Then, like in a movie, an event happened that made sense of everything, Google suffered the quintessential  #firstworldproblem , gmail accounts went missing! Queue emphatic music. And what's more they were taking a long time to come back. There was a palpable fear in the land that email accounts might never be restored. Think about that.

<p>Introduction: One consequence of IT   standardization and commodification    has been Google’s    datacenter is the computer    view of the world. In that view all compute resources (memory, CPU, storage) are fungible. They are interchangeable and location independent, individual computers lose identity and become just a part of a service.     Thwarting that nirvana has been the abysmal performance of commodity datacenter networks which have caused the preference of architectures that favor the collocation of state and behaviour on the same box. MapReduce famously    ships code over to storage nodes    for just this reason.    Change the network and you change the fundamental assumption driving collocation based software architectures. You are then free to store data anywhere and move compute anywhere you wish. The datacenter becomes the computer.     On the host side with an x8 slot running at    PCI-Express 3.0    speeds able to push 8GB/sec (that’s bytes) of bandwidth in both directions, we have</p><p>5 0.1133379 <a title="1310-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-16-Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_in_the_Ambient_Cloud.html">750 high scalability-2009-12-16-Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Google has released an epic second edition of their ground breaking  The Datacenter as a Computer  book. It's called an introduction, but at 156 pages I would love to see what the Advanced version would look like!
 
John Fries in a  G+ comment  has what I think is a perfect summary of the ultimate sense of the book:
  

It's funny, when I was at Google I was initially quite intimidated by interacting with an enormous datacenter, and then I started imagining the entire datacenter was shrunk down into a small box sitting on my desk, and realized it was just another machine and the physical size didn't matter anymore

  
It's such a far ranging book that it's impossible to characterize simply. It covers an amazing diversity of topics, from an introduction to warehouse-scale computing; workloads and software infrastructure; hardware; datacenter architecture; energy and power efficiency; cost structures; how to deal with failures and repairs; and it closes with a discussion of key challenge</p><p>3 0.7209065 <a title="1310-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-14-Google_Says_Cloud_Prices_Will_Follow_Moore%E2%80%99s_Law%3A_Are_We_All_Renters_Now%3F.html">1647 high scalability-2014-05-14-Google Says Cloud Prices Will Follow Moore’s Law: Are We All Renters Now?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The RAD Lab (Reliable Adaptive Distributed Systems Laboratory) wants to leapfrog the Big Switch and create The Next Big Switch, skipping the cloud/utility evolutionary stage altogether.

By doing so we hope to enable an Internet "Fortune 1 million".        How?

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my article  Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.  
 
There's a pattern, already begun, that has accelerated by the need for applications to scale and increase complexity, the end result of which will be that applications give up their independence and enter a kind of  feudal relationship  with their platform provider.
 
To understand how this process works, like a glacier slowly and inevitably carving out a deep river valley, here's the type of question I get quite a lot:
  I've learned PHP and MySQL and I've built a web app that I HOPE will receive traffic comparable to eBay's with a similar database structure. I see all these different opinions and different techniques and languages being recommended and it's so confusing. All I want is perhaps one book or one website that focuses on PHP and MySQL and building a large database web app like eBay's. Does something like this exist?

<p>Introduction: The Future of the Parallelism and its Challenges    Research and education in Parallel computing technologies is more important than ever. Here I present a perspective on the past contributions, current status, and future direction of the parallelism technologies.     While machine power will grow impressively, increased parallelism, rather than clock rate, will be driving force in computing in the foreseeable future. This ongoing shift toward parallel architectural paradigms is one of the greatest challenges for the microprocessor and software industries. In 2005, Justin Ratter, chief technology officer of Intel Corporation, said ‘We are at the cusp of a transition to multicore, multithreaded architectures, and we still have not demonstrated the ease of programming the move will require…’      Key points:       A Little history   Parallelism Challenges   Under the hood, Parallelism Challenges    Synchronization problems   CAS problems       The future of the parallelism</p><p>same-blog 3 0.86933005 <a title="1310-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-23-Economies_of_Scale_in_the_Datacenter%3A_Gmail_is_100x_Cheaper_to_Run_than_Your_Own_Server.html">1310 high scalability-2012-08-23-Economies of Scale in the Datacenter: Gmail is 100x Cheaper to Run than Your Own Server</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Urs Hoelzle , infrastructure guru and SVP at Google, made a  really interesting statement  about the economics of scale in the datacenter:
  

Weâ&euro;&trade;ve shown that when you run a large application in the datacenter, like Gmail, you can, compared to a small organization running their own email server, you can save nearly a factor of 100 in terms of compute and energy, when you run it at scale.

  
My first thought was shock at the magnitude of the difference. 100x is a chasm crosser. Then I thought about Gmail, it's horizontally scalable using technologies that are following Moore's Law (storage and compute), latency requirements are lax, a commodity network is sufficient, and it can be highly automated so management costs scale slower than users. After that it's a simple matter of software :-) Oh, and developing a market where it's "cheaper to run a large thing than a small thing."</p><p>4 0.84936923 <a title="1310-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-30-Strategy%3A_Get_Servers_for_Free_and_Make_Users_Happy_by_Turning_on_Compression.html">1254 high scalability-2012-05-30-Strategy: Get Servers for Free and Make Users Happy by Turning on Compression</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Edward Capriolo has a really interesting article on his dramatic performance expanding experience of   turning on compression for Cassandra   .   The idea: 
  
  Enabling compression shrunk 71GB of data down to  31GB, which caused more data to fit in RAM, which reduced disk IO to nearly nothing.  
  Compression means more data can be stored, which is like buying more machines without having to spend more money.  
  Compression means serving more data out of RAM, which means clients are happier because of the performance improvements.  
  The cost is higher CPU usage to perform the encrypt/decrypt. But disk IO is orders of magnitude slower than decompression and most servers have CPU to burn.  
  
 Edward's article is well written, has the specifics on how to turn on compression for Cassandra, pretty graphs, and lots more details.</p><p>5 0.84854645 <a title="1310-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-30-Strategy%3A_Use_Your_Quantum_Computer_Lab_to_Tell_Intentional_Blinks_from_Involuntary_Blinks.html">1540 high scalability-2013-10-30-Strategy: Use Your Quantum Computer Lab to Tell Intentional Blinks from Involuntary Blinks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Oh, you don't have a Quantum Computer Lab staffed with researchers? Well, Google does. Here they are  on G+ . To learn what they are up to the Verge has  A first look inside Google's futuristic quantum lab . The lab is partnership between NASA, Google, and a 512-qubit D-Wave Two quantum computer.  
 
One result from the lab is:
  

The first practical application has been on Google Glass, as engineers put the quantum chips to work on Glass's blink detector, helping it to better distinguish between intentional winks and involuntary blinks. For engineering reasons, the quantum processor can never be installed in Glass, but together with Google's conventional server centers, it can point the way to a better blink-detecting algorithm. That would allow the Glass processor to detect blinks with better accuracy and using significantly less power. If successful, it could be an important breakthrough for wink-triggered apps, which have struggled with the task so far.

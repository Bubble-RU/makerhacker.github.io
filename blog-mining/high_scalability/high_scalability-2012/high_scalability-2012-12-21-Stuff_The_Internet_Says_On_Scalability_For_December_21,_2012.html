<p>Introduction: It's a little known fact that Santa Clause was an early queue innovator. Faced
with the problem of delivering a planet full of presents in one night, Santa,
in his hacker's workshop, created a Present Distribution System using
thousands of region based priority present queues for continuous delivery by
the Rudolphs. Rudolphs? You didn't think there was only one Rudolph did you?
Presents are delivered in parallel by a cluster of sleighs, each with
redundant reindeer in a master-master configuration. Each Rudolph is a cluster
leader and they coordinate work using an early and more magical version of the
ZooKeeper protocol.Programmers have followed Santa's lead and you can find
amessage queue in nearly every major architecture profile onHighScalability.
Historically they may have been introduced after a first generation
architecture needed to scale up from their two tier system into something a
little more capable (asynchronicity, work dispatch, load buffering, database
offloading, etc).</p><p>3 0.1549677 <a title="1375-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-07-Six_Ways_Twitter_May_Reach_its_Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal_of_One_Billion_Users.html">837 high scalability-2010-06-07-Six Ways Twitter May Reach its Big Hairy Audacious Goal of One Billion Users</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Twitter has a big hairy audacious goal of reaching one billion users by 2013.
Three forces stand against Twitter. The world will end in2012. But let's be
optimistic and assume we'll make it. Next is Facebook. Currently Facebook is
the user leader with over 400 million users. Will Facebook stumble or will
they rocket to one billion users before Twitter? And lastly, there's Twitter's
"low" starting point and "slow" growth rate. Twitter currently has106
millionregistered users and adds about 300,000 new users a day. That doesn't
add up to a billion in three years. Twitter needs to triple the number of
registered users they add per day. How will Twitter reach its goal of over one
billion users served?From recent infrastructure announcements and information
gleaned atChirp (videos) and other talks, it has become a little clearer how
they hope to reach their billion user goal: 1) Make a Big Hairy Audacious Goal
2) Hire Lots of Quality People 3) Hug Developers and Users 4) Drive the

<p>Introduction: Update 6:Some interesting changes from Twitter'sEvan Weaver: everything in RAM
now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by
average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page
cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with
Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every
external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to
load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability;
switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to
get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them
locally.Update 5:Twitter on Scala. A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex
Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners. A fascinating discussion of why
Twitter moved to the Java JVM for their server infrastructure (long lived
processes) and why they moved toScalato program against it (high level

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: CNBC, like many large web sites, relied  on a CDN for content delivery.
Recently, we started looking  to see if we could improve this model.  Our
criteria was:- improve response time- have better control over traffic (real
time reporting, change management and alerting)- better utilize internal
datacenters and their infrastructure- shield users from any troubles at the
origin infrastructure- cost outAfter researching the market, we turned to two
vendors: Dyn (Dynamic Network Services) andaiScaler. We' have had   about a
year worth of experience withaiScaler (search for "CNBC" to see my previous
post ), but Dyn was a new vendor for us.  We started building our relationship
at Velocity conference in the summer of 2009.Dyn has recently started offering
a geo-aware DNS load balancing solution, using Anycast and the distributed
nature of their DNS presence to enable a key component of what we were trying
to achieve: steer users to geographically closest origin point. The traffic

<p>Introduction: Mollomis one of those cool SaaS companies every developer dreams of creating
when they wrack their brains looking for a viable software-as-a-service
startup. Mollom profitably runs a useful service--spam filtering--with a small
group of geographically distributed developers. Mollom helps protect nearly
40,000 websites from spam, includingone of mine, which is where I first
learned about Mollom. In a desperate attempt to stop spam on a Drupal site,
where every other form of CAPTCHA had failed miserably, I installed Mollom in
about 10 minutes and it immediately started working. That's the out of the box
experience I was looking for.From the time Mollom opened its digital
inspection system they've rejected over 373 million spams and in the process
they've learned that a stunning 90% of all messages are spam. This spam
torrent is handled by only two geographically distributed machines that handle
100 requests/ second, each running a Java application server and Cassandra. So

<p>Introduction: If you have a lot of static content to store and you aren't looking forward to
setting up and maintaining your own giganto SAN, maybe you can push off a lot
of the hard lifting to a CDN?Jesse Robbins at O'Reilly Radar posts that you
have a lot more options now because the number ofContent Distribution Networks
have doubled since last year. In fact, Dan Rayburn says there are now28
CDNproviders in the market. Hopefully you can find reasonable pricing at one
of them.Other than easing your burden, why might a CDN work for you? Because
it makes your site faster and customers like that. How can a CDN so
dramatically improve your site's performance?breakSteve Saunders, author
ofHigh Performance Web Sites: Essential Knowledge for Front-End Engineers, has

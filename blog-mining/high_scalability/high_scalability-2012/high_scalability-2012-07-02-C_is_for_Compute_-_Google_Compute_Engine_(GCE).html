<p>Introduction: This is a repost of part 2 (part 1) of an interviewI did for theBoundary
blog.Boundary:  There's another battle coming down the pike between Amazon
(AWS) and Google (GCE). How should the CTO decide which one's best?Hoff: Given
that GCE is still closed to public access we have very little common
experience on which to judge. The best way to decide is as always, by running
a few experiments. Pick a few representative projects, a representative team,
implement the projects on both infrastructures, crunch some numbers, figure
out the bigger picture and then select the one you wanted in the first place
.Sebastian Stadil, founder of Scalr, recently wrote about his experiences on
both platforms and found some interesting differences: AWS has a much richer
set of services; GCE is on-demand only, so AWS can be cheaper; GCE has faster
disk and faster network IO, especially between datacenters; GCE has faster
boot times and can mount read-only partitions across multiple machines; and

transactions per second with sub-millisecond latencies.Public cloud
environments typically mean virtualization, inconsistent network performance
and potentially slow or low bandwidth disk access. It just so happens that

CorinthiansWith this new pricing, developments will be driven by the costs.I

just to make them cheaper is a waste of time.-- Sylvain onGoogle GroupsThe

Architectures will change. Customers will change. Hearts and minds will
change. But Google App Engine will survive. Google isshutting downmany of

<p>Introduction: Update 2: Rumor no more.Google Jumps Head First Into Web Services With Google
App Engine. The quick and dirty of it: developers simply upload their Python
code to Google, launch the application, and can monitor usage and other
metrics via a multi-platform desktop application. There were 10,000 developer
slots open and of course I was too late. More as the cobra strikes.Update:
TechCrunch reportsGoogle To Launch BigTable As Web Servicenext week. It
competes with Amazon's SimpleDB. Though it won't be truly comparable until
they also release an EC2 and S3 equivalent. An internet hit for each data
access is a little painful. As Jimmy says in Goodfellas, "That's the way. You
don't take no sh*t from nobody. "FirstDave Winerhallucinates a pig on the mean
streets of Walnut Creek that told him Google's long foretold cloud offering
will be free for bloggers of "modest needs." GigaOM then says a free cloud
service is how Google could eatAmazon's bacon for lunch.The reason for this

<p>Introduction: When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as
a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. --
CorinthiansWith this new pricing, developments will be driven by the costs.I
like to optimize my apps to make them better or faster, but to optimize them
just to make them cheaper is a waste of time.-- Sylvain onGoogle GroupsThe
dream is dead. Google App Engine's boldpay for what you usedream dies as it
leaves childish things behind and becomes areal product.Pricing will change.
Architectures will change. Customers will change. Hearts and minds will
change. But Google App Engine will survive. Google isshutting downmany of
itsprojects. GAE is not among them. Do we have GAE's pricing change to thank
for it surving the more wood behindmore deadly arrows push? Without a radical
and quick shift towards profitably GAE would no doubt be a historical footnote
in the long scroll of good ideas. The urgency involved is clearly reflected in

<p>Introduction: How do you scale a viral Facebook app that has skyrocketed to a mind boggling
65 million installs (the population of France)? That's the fortunate
problemBuddyPokeco-founder Dave Westwood has and he talked about his solution
at Wednesday'sFacebook Meetup. Slides for the complete talk arehere. For those
not quite sure what BuddyPoke is, it's a social network application that lets
users show their mood, hug, kiss, and poke their friends through on-line
avatars.In many ways BuddyPoke is the quintessentially modern web application.
It thrives off the energy of social network driven ecosystems. Game play
mechanics, viral loops, and creative monetization strategies are all part of
if its everyday conceptualization. It mashes together different technologies,
not in a dark Frankensteining sort of way, but in a smart way that gets the
most bang for the buck. Part of it runs on Facebook servers (free). Part of it
runs on flash in a browser (free). Part of it runs on a storage cloud (higher
cost)</p><p>same-blog 2 0.97050029 <a title="1275-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-02-C_is_for_Compute_-_Google_Compute_Engine_%28GCE%29.html">1275 high scalability-2012-07-02-C is for Compute - Google Compute Engine (GCE)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After poking around theGoogle Compute Engine(GCE) documentation I had some
trouble creating a mental model of how GCE works. Is it like AWS, GAE,
Rackspace, just what is it? After watchingGoogle I/O 2012 - Introducing Google
Compute EngineandGoogle Compute Engine -- Technical Details, it turns out my
initial impression, that GCE is disarmingly straightforward, turns out to be
the point.The focus of GCE is on the C, which stands for Compute, and that's
what GCE is all about: deploying lots of servers to solve computationally hard
problems. What you get with GCE is a Super Datacenter on Google Steroids.If
you are wondering how you will run the next Instagram on GCE then that would
be missing the point. GAE is targeted at applications. GCE is targeted
at:Delivering a proven, pure, high performance, high scale compute
infrastructure using a utility pricing model, on top of an open, secure,
extensible Infrastructure-as-a-Service.Delivering an experience that feels

<p>Introduction: You might think major Internet companies have a latency, availability, and
bandwidth advantage because they can afford expensive dedicated point-to-point
private line networks between their data centers. And you would be right. It's
a great advantage. Or it at least it was a great advantage. Cost is the great
equalizer and companies are now scrambling for ways to cut costs. Many of the
most recognizable Internet companies are moving to IP VPNs (Virtual Private
Networks) as a much cheaper alternative to private lines. This is a strategy
you can effectively use too.This trend has historical precedent in the data
center. In the same way leading edge companies moved early to virtualize their
data centers, leading edge companies are now virtualizing their networks using
IP VPNs to build inexpensive private networks over a shared public network. In
kindergarten we learned sharing was polite, it turns out sharing can also save
a lot of money in both the data center and on the network.The line</p><p>4 0.95726955 <a title="1275-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-08-NuoDB%27s_First_Experience%3A_Google_Compute_Engine_-_1.8_Million_Transactions_Per_Second.html">1437 high scalability-2013-04-08-NuoDB's First Experience: Google Compute Engine - 1.8 Million Transactions Per Second</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a repost of the blog entry written by NuoDB's Tommy Reilly.  We
atNuoDBwere recently given the opportunity to kick the tires on the Google
Compute Engine by our friends over at Google. You can watch the entire Google
Developer Live Session by clickinghere.  In order to access the capabilities
of GCE we decided to run the same YCSB based benchmark we ran at our General
Availability Launch back in January. For those of you who missed it we
demonstrated running the YCSB benchmark on a 24 machine cluster running on our
private cloud in the NuoDB datacenter. The salient results were 1.7 million
transactions per second with sub-millisecond latencies.Public cloud
environments typically mean virtualization, inconsistent network performance
and potentially slow or low bandwidth disk access. It just so happens that
NuoDB was designed to work well in such harsh environments (we don't call it a
cloud database for nothing). Still, the faster the CPU, network and disk the
faster the database</p><p>5 0.95698601 <a title="1275-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-11-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_11th%2C_2014.html">1630 high scalability-2014-04-11-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 11th, 2014</a></p>

Yes, it Delivers More Consistent and Higher Performance IO</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Amazon created a whole new class of service with their  Provisioned IOPS  for RDS, EBS, and DynamoDB. The idea is simple. If you want more performance, you turn a dial up. If you want less, you turn a dial down. A beautifully simple model. You pay for the performance you want, which is different than their previous cloud model, where performance varied, but you paid only for what you used. 
 
The question: Do these higher priced services really work better?
 
 Rodrigo Campos  put this question to the test (only for EBS) by running a benchmark he describes in  IOMelt Provisioned IOPS EBS Benchmark Results - December 2012 .
 
The result?  Yes,   AWS Provisioned IOPS Volumes Really Deliver More Consistent and Higher Performance IO :
  

It is clear that the provisioned IOPS EBS volumes offer a huge performance upgrade when compared to the non-optimized EBS volumes, but as data has to be spread among more underlying disks or systems, it seems that the volume is increasingly more susceptibl</p><p>3 0.11416669 <a title="1306-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-21-5_Scalability_Poisons_and_3_Cloud_Scalability_Antidotes.html">1121 high scalability-2011-09-21-5 Scalability Poisons and 3 Cloud Scalability Antidotes</a></p>

 5 Things That are Toxic to Scalability :
  
  Object Relational Mappers.  Create complex queries that hard to optimize and tweak. 
  Synchronous, Serial, Coupled or Locking Processes.  Locks are like stop signs, traffic circles keep the traffic flowing. Row level locking is better than table level locking. Use async replication. Use eventual consistency for clusters. 
  One Copy of Your Database.  A single database server is a choke point.   Create parallel databases and let a driver select between them. 
  Having No Metrics.  Visualize what's happening to your system using one of the many monitoring packages. 
  Lack of Feature Flags.  Be able to turn off features via a flag so when a spike hits features can be turned off to reduce load. 
  
 3 Ways to Boost Cloud Scalability :
  
  Use Auto-scaling.  Spin-up new instances when a threshold is passed and back down again when traffic drops.

<p>Introduction: Update:  A fun exploration of applied searching in  How to search for the word "pen1s" in 185 emails every second . When indexOf doesn't cut it you just trie harder.   Has a drunken friend ever inspired you to create a first of its kind internet service that is loved by millions, deemed subversive by thousands, all while handling over 1.2 billion emails a year on one  rickity  old server? That's how Paul Tyma came to build Mailinator.   Mailinator is a free no-setup web service for thwarting evil spammers by creating throw-away registration email addresses. If you don't give web sites you real email address they can't spam you. They spam Mailinator instead :-)   I love design with a point-of-view and Mailinator has a big giant harry one: performance first, second, and last. Why? Because Mailinator is free and that allows Paul to showcase his different perspective on design. While competitors buy big Iron to handle load, Paul uses a big idea instead: pick the right problem and create a</p><p>5 0.097230107 <a title="1306-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-26-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_October_26%2C_2012.html">1348 high scalability-2012-10-26-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For October 26, 2012</a></p>

  @rbranson  :  Datadog stays available  where it counts (metrics injest) by using Cassandra, combined with an RDBMS for queries. Nice.  
  @jmhodges  : Few engineers know what modern hw is capable of, in part, because the only people that see the numbers are in orgs that had to care or die. 
  @tinagroves  : Storing the brain in the cloud might cost $38/month asserts Jim Adelius at #strataconf in talk on #bigdata and thought crimes. 
 
 
 
  Why is it hard to scale a database, in layman’s terms?  on Quora. Some really good answers. My answer would involve a cookie jar filled with all different kinds of cookies and a motley crew of kindergartners all trying to get cookies at the same time while keebler elves are trying to fill up the jar, all at the same time.

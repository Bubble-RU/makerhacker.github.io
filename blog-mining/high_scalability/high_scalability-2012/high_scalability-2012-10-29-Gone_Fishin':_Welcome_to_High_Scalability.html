<p>Introduction: Love this little example of the human condition from  John Kellden Â via  Ilya Grigorik . This happens so often to me shopping at Costco or making lane changes on the highway or picking stocks. Sometimes it's just never the right line and trying to make it better only makes it worse. Stick and stay. Buy and hold. Live to queue another day.</p><p>5 0.11119998 <a title="1349-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-01-Web_Speed_Can_Push_You_Off_of_Google_Search_Rankings%21_What_Can_You_Do%3F.html">834 high scalability-2010-06-01-Web Speed Can Push You Off of Google Search Rankings! What Can You Do?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Google made a right move by adding web-speed to the search engine ranking. With this change site latency does't just impact the user experience but it will determine where you will be placed in google search results.
 
This move could be a real game changer as it bring site latency and scalability to the front stage. Sites will not only compete on content but on thier performance. It is now clear that site performance have much more direct impact on our business (as appose to indirect impact resulted in user expereince) then ever before.
 
In this post i try to provide some architecture guide line on how to control and improve site latency under scale based on a discussion with a leading eCommerce site the Netherland.

With this in mind, what would be the best approach to launch the site?

I see many website build in languages other than java so java is good choice for building high scalable website.

<p>Introduction: As a little trip down memory lane this was the first post on High Scalability, an unbelievable five years ago. The purpose of the site as laid out here has not really changed at all. The goal is to help people do their jobs better and I think more times than not that's what has happened... 
 
We started High Scalability to help you build successful scalable websites. This site tries to bring together all the lore, art, science, practice, and experience of building scalable websites into one place so you can learn how to build your system with confidence. Hopefully this site will move you further and faster along the learning curve of success. Please  Start Here

<p>Introduction: In  Secrets to Lightning Fast Mobile Design , Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger shares three strategies Instagram uses to outsmart high latency mobile networks and make mobile apps feel faster than they really are, which helped Instagram reach 12 million users in 12 months:
  
  The motivation:  "mobile experiences fill gaps while we wait. no one wants to wait while they wait" 
  Perform actions optimistically . Make the user feel productive. Likes, comments, and follows are registered on screen while the like operation is being sent in the background.  
  Adaptively preload content . Load content before it's needed. Don't images according to time, it will take too long, instead re-prioritize based on interest. Show what the social network things is the most popular. Listen to what your user's flicks and taps are telling you. 
  Move bits when no-one is watching.  Picture uploading starts  before  you share them, most apps wait until after the share screen. The rule is send data as soo</p><p>3 0.87409961 <a title="1349-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-13-How_is_Berkely_DB_fare_against_other_Key-Value_Database.html">704 high scalability-2009-09-13-How is Berkely DB fare against other Key-Value Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I want to know how is Berkeley DB compared against other key-value solution. I read it from Net that Google uses it for their Enterprise Sign-on feature. Is anyone has any experience using Berkeley DB. Backward compatibility is poor in Berkley DB but that is fine for me. How easy to scale using Berkeley DB.</p><p>4 0.87041014 <a title="1349-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-14-Ask_HS%3A_Design_and_Implementation_of_scalable_services%3F.html">1578 high scalability-2014-01-14-Ask HS: Design and Implementation of scalable services?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We have written agents deployed/distributed across the network. Agents sends data every 15 Secs may be even 5 secs. Working on a service/system to which all agent can post data/tuples with marginal payload. Upto 5% drop rate is acceptable. Ultimately the data will be segregated and stored into DBMS System (currently we are using MSQL).
 
Question(s) I am looking for answer
 
1. Client/Server Communication: Agent(s) can post data. Status of sending data is not that important. But there is a remote where Agent(s) to be notified if the server side system generates an event based on the data sent.
 
- Lot of advices from internet suggests using Message Bus (ActiveMQ) for async communication. Multicast and UDP are the alternatives.
 
2. Persistence: After some evaluation data to be stored in DBMS System.
 
- End of processing data is an aggregated record for which MySql looks scalable. But on the volume of data is exponential. Considering HBase as an option.

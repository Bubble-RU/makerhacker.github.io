<p>Introduction: GraphChiuses aParallel Sliding Windowsmethod which can: process a graph with
mutable edge values efficiently from disk, with only a small number of non-
sequential disk accesses, while supporting the asynchronous model of
computation.The result is graphs with billions of edges can be processed on
just a single machine. It uses a vertex-centric computation model similar
toPregel, which supports iterative algorithims as apposed to the batch style
of MapReduce. Streaming graph updates are supported.About GraphChi, Carlos
Guestrin, codirector of Carnegie Mellon's Select Lab,says:A Mac Mini running
GraphChi can analyze Twitter's social graph from 2010--which contains 40
million users and 1.2 billion connections--in 59 minutes. "The previous

<p>Introduction: On the surface nothing appears more different than soft data and hard raw
materials like iron. Then isn't itironic, in theAlanis Morissettesense, that
in this Age of Information, great wealth still lies hidden deep beneath piles
of stuff? It's so strange how directly digging for dollars in data parallels
the great wealth producing models of the Industrial Revolution.The piles of
stuff is the Internet. It takes lots of prospecting to find the right stuff.
Mighty web crawling machines tirelessly collect stuff, bringing it into their
huge maws, then depositing load after load into rack after rack of distributed
file system machines. Then armies of still other machines take this stuff and
strip out the valuable raw materials, which in the Information Age, are
endless bytes of raw data. Link clicks, likes, page views, content, head
lines, searches, inbound links, outbound links, search clicks, hashtags,
friends, purchases: anything and everything you do on the Internet is a
valuable raw mat</p><p>4 0.14504693 <a title="1365-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Bees have a similar problem to website servers: how to do a lot of work with
limited resources in an ever changing environment. Usually lessons from
biology are hard to apply to computer problems. Nature throws hardware at
problems. Billions and billions of cells cooperate at different levels of
organizations to find food, fight lions, and make sure your DNA is passed
on.Nature's software is "simple," but her hardware rocks. We do the opposite.
For us hardware is in short supply so we use limited hardware and leverage
"smart" software to work around our inability to throw hardware at problems.
But we might be able to borrow some load balancing techniques from bees. What
do bees do that we can learn from?Bees do a dance to indicate the quality and
location of a nectar source. When a bee finds a better source they do a better
dance and resources shift to the new location. This approach may seem
inefficient, but it turns out to be "optimal for the unpredictable nectar
world." Craig Tovey</p><p>2 0.95154589 <a title="1365-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-09-Rules_of_Thumb_in_Data_Engineering.html">463 high scalability-2008-12-09-Rules of Thumb in Data Engineering</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an interesting and still relevant research paper by Jim Gray, Prashant
Shenoy at Microsoft Research that examines the rules of thumb for the design
of data storage systems. It looks at storage, processing, and networking
costs, ratios, and trends with a particular focus on performance and
price/performance.Jim Gray has an updated presentation on this interesting
topic:Long Term Storage Trends and You. Robin Harris has a great post that
reflects on the Rules of Thumb whitepaper on his StorageMojo blog:Architecting

<p>Introduction: In the articleThe Onion Uses Django, And Why It Matters To Us, a lot of
interesting points are made about their ambitious infrastructure move from
Drupal/PHP to Django/Python: the move wasn't that hard, it just took time and
work because of their previous experience moving the A.V. Club website; churn
in core framework APIs make it more attractive to move than stay; supporting
the structure of older versions of the site is an unsolved problem; the built-
in Django admin saved a lot of work; group development is easier with "fewer
specialized or hacked together pieces"; they use IRC for distributed
development; sphinx for full-text search; nginx is the media server and
reverse proxy; haproxy made the launch process a 5 second procedure;
capistrano for deployment; clean component separation makes moving easier; Git
for version control; ORM with complicated querysets is a performance problem;
memcached for caching rendered pages; the CDN checks for updates every 10
minutes; videos, articl</p><p>same-blog 5 0.91453725 <a title="1365-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-30-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_November_30%2C_2012.html">1365 high scalability-2012-11-30-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For November 30, 2012</a></p>

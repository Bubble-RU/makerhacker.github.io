<p>Introduction: Gartner published recently an interesting paper:  Productivity vs. Control: Cloud Application Platforms Must Split to Win  . (The paper requires registration.)
 
The paper does a pretty good job covering the evolution that is taking place in the PaaS market toward a more open platform and compares between the two main categories: aPaaS (essentially a PaaS running as a service) and CEAP (Cloud Enabled Application Platform) which is the  *P* out of PaaS that gives you the platform to build your own PaaS in private or public cloud.
 
While I was reading through the paper I felt that something continued to bother me with this definition, even though I tend to agree with the overall observation. If I follow the logic of this paper than I have to give away productivity to gain control, hmm…  that’s a hard choice.

<p>Introduction: Yesterday, I had a session during the  OpenStack Summit   where I tried to present a more general view on how we should be thinking about PaaS in the context of OpenStack.
 
The key takeaway :
 
The main goal of PaaS is to drive productivity into the  process  by which we can deliver new applications.
 
Most of the existing PaaS solutions take a fairly extreme approach with their abstraction of the underlying infrastructure and therefore fit a fairly small number of extremely simple applications and thus miss the real promise of PaaS.
 
Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk took a more bottom up approach giving us better set of tradeoffs between the abstraction and control which makes it more broadly applicable to a larger set of applications.
 
 The fact that OpenStack is opensource allows us to think differently on the things we can do at the platform layer.  We can create a tighter integration between the PaaS and IaaS layers and thus come up with better set of tradeoffs into the way we drive</p><p>4 0.21751107 <a title="1216-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-06-Big_Data_Application_Platform.html">1110 high scalability-2011-09-06-Big Data Application Platform</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's time to think of the architecture and application platforms surrounding "Big Data" databases. Big Data is often centered  around new database technologies mostly from the emerging NoSQL world.  The main challenge that these databases solve is how to handle massive amount of data at a reasonable cost and without poor performanc - distributed databases emerged to address this challenge and today we're seeing  high adoption rate   and quite impressive success stories such as the  Netflix use of Cassandra/DataStax solution  .  All that indicate the speed in which this market evolves.
 
  The need for a Big Data Application Platform  
 
Application platforms provide a framework for making the development of applications simpler. They do this by carving out the generic parts of applications such as security, scalability, and reliability (which  are  attributes of a 'good' application) from the parts of the applications that are specific to our business domain.

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear?

<p>Introduction: Data centers are reshaping themselves by taking ideas from public cloud providers, such as Amazon and Google. The idea is to make the data center more cost-effective by enabling on-demand utility-based computing rather than dedicated machines. At the same time, it is clear that to make IT operations more effective, it doesn't make sense to run all the applications that are currently hosted in a company's data center in the private cloud. This calls for an integration between private and public cloud. In this post i discuss some of the challenges involved in making that happen:    1. How do we design applications to be cloud-agnostic?    2. How do we enable seamless fail-over to a public cloud?    3. Future-proofing: There are many cases in which we can't make a clear decision as to where our application should be running at the time of writing or developing the application. We would like to be in a position to change the decision as to where our application will be running even after o</p><p>3 0.79986703 <a title="1216-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-09-Productivity_vs._Control_tradeoffs_in_PaaS.html">1002 high scalability-2011-03-09-Productivity vs. Control tradeoffs in PaaS</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Oh, you don't have a Quantum Computer Lab staffed with researchers? Well, Google does. Here they are  on G+ . To learn what they are up to the Verge has  A first look inside Google's futuristic quantum lab . The lab is partnership between NASA, Google, and a 512-qubit D-Wave Two quantum computer.  
 
One result from the lab is:
  

The first practical application has been on Google Glass, as engineers put the quantum chips to work on Glass's blink detector, helping it to better distinguish between intentional winks and involuntary blinks. For engineering reasons, the quantum processor can never be installed in Glass, but together with Google's conventional server centers, it can point the way to a better blink-detecting algorithm. That would allow the Glass processor to detect blinks with better accuracy and using significantly less power. If successful, it could be an important breakthrough for wink-triggered apps, which have struggled with the task so far.

<p>Introduction: Urs Hoelzle , infrastructure guru and SVP at Google, made a  really interesting statement  about the economics of scale in the datacenter:
  

Weâ&euro;&trade;ve shown that when you run a large application in the datacenter, like Gmail, you can, compared to a small organization running their own email server, you can save nearly a factor of 100 in terms of compute and energy, when you run it at scale.

  
My first thought was shock at the magnitude of the difference. 100x is a chasm crosser. Then I thought about Gmail, it's horizontally scalable using technologies that are following Moore's Law (storage and compute), latency requirements are lax, a commodity network is sufficient, and it can be highly automated so management costs scale slower than users. After that it's a simple matter of software :-) Oh, and developing a market where it's "cheaper to run a large thing than a small thing."</p><p>same-blog 3 0.92267931 <a title="1216-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-27-Big_Data_In_the_Cloud_Using_Cloudify.html">1216 high scalability-2012-03-27-Big Data In the Cloud Using Cloudify</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Edd Dumbill  wrote an interesting article on O’Reilly Radar covering the current solutions for running  Big Data in the Cloud   
  Big data and cloud technology go hand-in-hand. Big data needs clusters of servers for processing, which clouds can readily provide.
   Big PaaS 
  Edd touched briefly on the role of PaaS for delivering Big Data applications in the cloud
  Beyond IaaS, several cloud services provide application layer support for big data work. Sometimes referred to as managed solutions, or  platform as a service   (PaaS), these services remove the need to ucale things such as databases or MapReduce, reducing your workload and maintenance burden. Additionally, PaaS providers can realize great efficiencies by hosting at the application level, and pass those savings on to the customer.
 
To put it simply, managing data clusters is one thing. Being able to process the data is yet another challenge that we need to think about when we’re dealing with application platforms, as I no</p><p>4 0.92143363 <a title="1216-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-04-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_4%2C_2011.html">984 high scalability-2011-02-04-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 4, 2011</a></p>

I'll be rooting for Green Bay, but the Pittsburgh defense will eventually win the day, beating back the fleet footed, quick tossing, and sharp shooting Aaron Rodgers. Roethlisberger will make exactly 3 plays that matter, but they'll be the right 3 plays.

<p>Introduction: The Future of the Parallelism and its Challenges    Research and education in Parallel computing technologies is more important than ever. Here I present a perspective on the past contributions, current status, and future direction of the parallelism technologies.     While machine power will grow impressively, increased parallelism, rather than clock rate, will be driving force in computing in the foreseeable future. This ongoing shift toward parallel architectural paradigms is one of the greatest challenges for the microprocessor and software industries. In 2005, Justin Ratter, chief technology officer of Intel Corporation, said ‘We are at the cusp of a transition to multicore, multithreaded architectures, and we still have not demonstrated the ease of programming the move will require…’      Key points:       A Little history   Parallelism Challenges   Under the hood, Parallelism Challenges    Synchronization problems   CAS problems       The future of the parallelism</p><p>6 0.91902566 <a title="1216-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-30-Strategy%3A_Get_Servers_for_Free_and_Make_Users_Happy_by_Turning_on_Compression.html">1254 high scalability-2012-05-30-Strategy: Get Servers for Free and Make Users Happy by Turning on Compression</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-

<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built
by a small group of people, under immense pressure, trying to get a lot of

<p>Introduction: The argument for a massively multicore future is now familiar: while clock
speeds have leveled off, device density is increasing, so the future is cheap
chips with hundreds and thousands of cores. That's the inexorable logic behind
our multicore future.The unsolved question that lurks deep in the dark part of
a programmer's mind is: how on earth are we to program these things? For
problems that aren'tembarrassingly parallel, we really have no idea. IBM
Research'sDavid Ungarhas an idea. And it's radical in the extreme...Grace
Hopperonce advised "It's easier to ask for forgiveness than it is to get
permission." I wonder if she had any idea that her strategy for dealing with
human bureaucracy would the same strategy David Ungar thinks will help us tame
the technological bureaucracy of 1000+ core systems?You may recognize David as

<p>Introduction: I had a false beliefI thought I came here to stayWe're all just visitingAll
just breaking like wavesThe oceans made me, but who came up with me?Push me,
pull me, push me, or pull me out .So true Perl Jam(Push me Pull me lyrics), so
true. I too have wondered how web clients should be notified of model changes.
Should servers push events to clients or should clients pull events from
servers? A topic worthy of its own song if ever there was one.breakTo pull
events the client simply starts a timer and makes a request to the server.
This is polling. You can either pull a complete set of fresh data or get a
list of changes. The server "knows" if anything you are interested in has
changed and makes those changes available to you. Knowing what has changed can
be relatively simple with a publish-subscribe type backend or you can get very
complex with fine grained bit maps of attributes and keeping per client state
on what I client still needs to see.Polling is heavy man. Imagine all your

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post derived from an email conversation withRussell Sullivan,
a computer architect and creator ofAlchemy Database,A Hybrid RDBMS/NOSQL-
Datastore.Russell (AKA Jak Sprats) has been pondering, considering, and
implementing distributed databases for many years. In a recent email
conversation he shared 44 of the lessons he has learned from developing the
infrastructure for high performance / highly scalable systems. Some are well
known, some are debatable, and some obviously result from a deep experience
that is worth learning from:There are maybe 20 classic bottlenecks (CPU, NIC
overload, memory fragmentation, disk seeks, swap, thread deadlock, packet
loss, etc.), have a basic understanding of them, because each is a dark
tunnel, and you need a specialised flashlight for each.The true style of
scalable architecture is rooted in the nature of bottlenecks. I always talk
aboutcommutative operationson a sharded relational model, and I figure if that

Performance and scalability anxiety makes developers want to catch the flying
butterflies@tivrfoa:"Scalability solutions aren't magic. They involve
partitioning, indexing and replication." Twitter engineerAlan Perlis: Fools
ignore complexity; pragmatists suffer it; experts avoid it; geniuses remove
it.CIO update: Post-mortem on the Skype outage. Interesting tale of a
cascading collapse in complex, distributed, interactive systems. For more
background see the highly illuminating Explaining Supernodes by Dan

exciting, it wasn't as revolutionary in 2010 as I would have liked to have

What you can do?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guestrepostby Ron Pressler, the founder and CEO ofParallel Universe,
a Y Combinator company building advanced middleware for real-time
applications. Little's Law helps us determine the maximum request rate a
server can handle. When we apply it, we find that the dominating factor
limiting a server's capacity is not the hardware but theOS.Should we buy more
hardware if software is the problem? If not, how can we remove that software
limitation in a way that does not make the code much harder to write and
understand?Many modern web applications are composed of multiple (often
many)HTTPservices (this is often called a micro-service architecture). This
architecture has many advantages in terms of code reuse and maintainability,
scalability and fault tolerance. In this post I'd like to examine one
particular bottleneck in the approach, which hinders scalability as well as
fault tolerance, and various ways to deal with it (I am using the term
"scalability" very loosely in this post</p><p>5 0.992899 <a title="1199-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-08-Eight_Best_Practices_for_Building_Scalable_Systems.html">594 high scalability-2009-05-08-Eight Best Practices for Building Scalable Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wille Faler hascreated an excellent list of best practicesfor building
scalable and high performance systems. Here's a short summary of his
points:Offload the database- Avoid hitting the database, and avoid opening
transactions or connections unless you absolutely need to use them.What a
difference a cache makes- For read heavy applications caching is the easiest
way offload the database.Cache as coarse-grained objects as possible- Coarse-
grained objects save CPU and time by requiring fewer reads to assemble
objects.Don't store transient state permanently- Is it really necessary to
store your transient data in the database?Location, Location- put things close
to where they are supposed to be delivered.Constrain concurrent access to
limited resource- it's quicker to let a single thread do work and finish
rather than flooding finite resources with 200 client threads.Staged,
asynchronous processing- separate a process using asynchronicity into separate
steps mediated by queues and execut</p><p>6 0.99149585 <a title="1199-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-16-Paper%3A_Scaling_Online_Social_Networks_without_Pains.html">723 high scalability-2009-10-16-Paper: Scaling Online Social Networks without Pains</a></p>

[sent-3, score-0.26]
</p><p>2 The forwarding tables are set up by software – the  control plane  – that is usually embedded in the same networking device. [sent-10, score-0.588]
</p><p>3 There are a few notable exceptions, including wireless access points with central controllers and data center switch clusters using  Borg architecture  (no, that’s not an official term for a cluster of devices with a single control plane). [sent-11, score-0.528]
</p><p>4 OpenFlow is a standardized protocol that can be used between control- and forwarding planes. [sent-12, score-0.237]
</p><p>5 The architecture where the control plane is centralized and separate from the physical devices is called   Software Defined Networking     according to the definition promoted by the  Open Networking Foundation . [sent-13, score-0.437]
</p><p>6 Using OpenFlow, you could buy forwarding devices from any vendor (or multiple vendors) and program their forwarding tables with open-source control plane software running on low-cost commodity x86 hardware . [sent-14, score-0.741]
</p><p>7 ”   Scalable SDN Example   Some solutions use OpenFlow to program a number of independent devices that don’t interact with each other. [sent-31, score-0.313]
</p><p>8 Each hypervisor switch is totally independent from all other switches and does not interact with them directly; user (VM) traffic is  encapsulated in IP datagrams and sent to the network , which is supposed to provide end-to-end IP transport. [sent-37, score-0.455]
</p><p>9 NVP is focused exclusively on the hypervisor switches and does not interact with the physical networking devices at all; even server NIC bonding and failover is left to the Linux kernel. [sent-38, score-0.67]
</p><p>10 In their planned solution, they would use OpenFlow to intercept initial user traffic (until the user passes authentication) and to download access policy (usually in form of Access Control List – ACL) to the edge device (wireless or Ethernet switch). [sent-45, score-0.228]
</p><p>11 The only shared object in the system Indiana University is planning to build is the central policy database, which would be accessed by a cluster of OpenFlow controllers interacting with individual networking devices. [sent-46, score-0.324]
</p><p>12 Scaling the controller cluster to cope with the growing number of controlled devices is thus a trivial exercise. [sent-47, score-0.345]
</p><p>13 For example, NEC has  implemented an OpenFlow controller  that is supposed to control the whole data center network. [sent-52, score-0.234]
</p><p>14 But even there, their implementation quickly hit real-life limits:     The number of flows a physical device can handle in hardware is limited, and the software-based devices are still too slow. [sent-53, score-0.338]
</p><p>15 A device using hardware-based packet forwarding can install only a  limited number of flows in a time period  (usually less than thousand flows per second), a fact that is  well known to manufacturers and users of high-end routers . [sent-55, score-0.409]
</p><p>16 There’s also the “slight” problem of network devices losing connectivity with the central controller if the primary uplink fails. [sent-59, score-0.427]
</p><p>17 They use traditional routing protocols (BGP+IS-IS) between sites and further influence traffic flow with proprietary traffic engineering technology similar (in functionality) to MPLS-TP. [sent-63, score-0.316]
</p><p>18 A single OpenFlow controller can control only a few dozens of top-of-rack switches without supporting “linecard protocols” like LACP or BFD, or running routing protocols or spanning tree protocol (STP) with the external devices. [sent-66, score-0.47]
</p><p>19 Some of them focused on controlling a large number of independent edge devices, others decided to use the advantages of OpenFlow while retaining the distributed nature of the system that gives large-scale IP networks (example: the Internet) their resilience. [sent-70, score-0.24]
</p><p>20 They use OpenFlow solely to control of a cluster of local devices and combine local controllers with centralized path computation and traditional time-proven technologies (routing protocols). [sent-72, score-0.485]

<p>Introduction: For years a war has been fought in the software architecture trenches between the ideal of decentralized services and the power and practicality of centralized services. Centralized architectures, at least at the  management and control plane  level, are winning. And Google not only agrees, they are enthusiastic adopters of this model, even in places you don't think it should work.
 
Here's an excerpt from  Google Lifts Veil On “Andromeda” Virtual Networking , an excellent article by Timothy Morgan, that includes a money quote from  Amin Vahdat , distinguished engineer and technical lead for networking at Google:
  Like many of the massive services that Google has created, the Andromeda network has centralized control. By the way, so did the Google File System and the MapReduce scheduler that gave rise to Hadoop when it was mimicked, so did the BigTable NoSQL data store that has spawned a number of quasi-clones, and even the B4 WAN and the Spanner distributed file system that have yet</p><p>4 0.11505842 <a title="1256-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-14-Virtualization_and_Cloud_Computing_is_Changing_the_Network_to_East-West_Routing.html">1157 high scalability-2011-12-14-Virtualization and Cloud Computing is Changing the Network to East-West Routing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It’s  called “east-west” networking, which when compared to its predecessor,  “north-south” networking, evinces images of maelstroms and hurricane  winds and tsunamis for some reason. It could be the subtle correlation  between the transformative shift this change in networking patterns has  on the data center with that of El Niño’s transformative power upon the  weather patterns across the globe.
  

    Traditionally,  data center networks have focused on North-South network traffic. The  assumption is that clients on the edge would mainly communicate with  servers at the core, rather than across the network to other clients. 


 But  server virtualization changes all this, with servers, virtual  appliances and even virtual desktops scattered across the same physical  infrastructure. These environments are also highly dynamic, with  workloads moving to different physical locations on the network as  virtual servers are migrated (in the case of data center networks) and  clients move</p><p>5 0.10187452 <a title="1256-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-06-Apple_iCloud%3A_Syncing_and_Distributed_Storage_Over_Streaming_and_Centralized_Storage.html">1053 high scalability-2011-06-06-Apple iCloud: Syncing and Distributed Storage Over Streaming and Centralized Storage</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There has been a lot of speculation over how Apple's  iCloud  would work. With the  Apple Worldwide Developers Conference  keynotes having just completed, we finally learned the truth. We can handle it. They made some interesting and cost effective architecture choices that preserved the value of their devices and the basic model of how their existing services work.
 
A lot of pundits foretold that with all the datacenters Apple was building we would get a streaming music solution. Only one copy of music would be stored and then streamed on demand to everyone. Or they could go the Google brute force method and copy up all a user's music and play it on demand.
 
Apple did neither. The chose an interesting middle path that's not Google, Amazon, or even MobileMe.
 
They key idea is you no longer need a PC. Device content is now synced over the air and is managed by the cloud, not your legacy computer.

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectives  is a series of posts that highlights the ideas that will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires an open mind.     Van Jacobson    Van Jacobson is a Research Fellow at   PARC  . Prior to that he was Chief Scientist and co-founder of Packet Design. Prior to that he was Chief Scientist at Cisco. Prior to that he was head of the Network Research group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He's been studying networking since 1969. He still hopes that someday something will start to make sense.    Scaling the Internet – Does the Net needs an upgrade?    As the Internet is being overrun with video traffic, many wonder if it can survive.

<p>Introduction: Someone is killing the Internet. Since you probably use the Internet everyday you might find this surprising. It almost sounds silly, and the reason is technical, but our crack team of networking experts has examined the patient and made the diagnosis. What did they find?
  
  Diagnostic team : the  Packet Pushers  gang ( Greg Ferro ,  Jan Zorz ,  Ivan Pepelnjak ) in the podcast  How We Are Killing the Internet .  
  Diagnosis : invasive tunnelation. ( tubes anyone? ) 
  Prognosis : even Dr. House might not be able to help. 
  Cure : go back to what the Internet was; kill the tunnels; route IPv4 and IPv6; have public addresses on everything; disrupt the telcos. 
  
This is a classic story in a strange setting--the network--but the themes are universal: centralization vs. decentralization (that's where the telcos obviously come in), good vs. evil, order vs. disorder, tyranny vs. freedom, change vs. stasis, simplicity vs. complexity. And it's all being carried out on battlefield few get</p><p>4 0.81457353 <a title="1256-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-20-It%27s_Networking._In_Space%21_Or_How_E.T._Will_Phone_Home..html">1651 high scalability-2014-05-20-It's Networking.

<p>Introduction: What will the version of the Internet that follows us to the stars look like? Yes, people are really thinking seriously about this sort of thing. Specifically the  InterPlanetary Networking Special Interest Group  (IPNSIG).
 
 
 
 Ansible-like  faster-than-light communication it isn't. There's no magical warp drive. Nor is a network of telepaths acting as a 'verse spanning telegraph system.
 
It's more mundane than that. And in many ways more interesting as it's sort of like the old Internet on steroids, the one that was based on on UUCP and dial-up connections, but over vastly longer distances and with much  longer delays :
  

The Interplanetary Internet (based on IPN, also called InterPlaNet) is a conceived computer network in space, consisting of a set of network nodes which can communicate with each other.[1][2] Communication would be greatly delayed by the great interplanetary distances, so the IPN needs a new set of protocols and technology that are tolerant to large delays and</p><p>5 0.80258399 <a title="1256-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-24-A_Scalable%2C_Commodity_Data_Center_Network_Architecture.html">371 high scalability-2008-08-24-A Scalable, Commodity Data Center Network Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Looks interesting...  Abstract: Todayâ&euro;&trade;s data centers may contain tens of thousands of computers with significant aggregate bandwidth requirements. The network architecture typically consists of a tree of routing and switching elements with progressively more specialized and expensive equipment moving up the network hierarchy. Unfortunately, even when deploying the highest-end IP switches/routers, resulting topologies may only support 50% of the aggregate bandwidth available at the edge of the network, while still incurring tremendous cost. Nonuniform bandwidth among data center nodes complicates application design and limits overall system performance. In this paper, we show how to leverage largely commodity Ethernet switches to support the full aggregate bandwidth of clusters consisting of tens of thousands of elements. Similar to how clusters of commodity computers have largely replaced more specialized SMPs and MPPs, we argue that appropriately architected and interconnected commodi</p><p>6 0.79565936 <a title="1256-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-27-Hidden_History%3A_Driving_the_Last_Spike_of_the_Transcontinental_Railroad_was_an_Early_Version_of_the_Internet_of_Things.html">1555 high scalability-2013-11-27-Hidden History: Driving the Last Spike of the Transcontinental Railroad was an Early Version of the Internet of Things</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ivan Pepelnjak  (CCIE#1354 Emeritus) is Chief Technology Advisor at  NIL Data Communications ,  author of numerous webinars  and  advanced networking books , and a  prolific blogger . He’s focusing on data center and cloud networking, network virtualization, and scalable application design. 
 
OpenFlow is an interesting emerging networking technology appearing  seemingly out of nowhere with much hype and fanfare  in March 2011. More than a year later, there are two commercial products based on OpenFlow ( NEC’s Programmable Flow  and  Nicira’s Network Virtualization Platform ) and probably less than a dozen production-grade implementations (including  Google’s G-Scale network  and  Indiana University’s campus network ). Is this an expected result for an emerging technology or another case of overhyped technology hitting limits imposed by reality?
 
OpenFlow-based solutions have to overcome numerous problems every emerging technology is facing, in OpenFlow’s case ranging from compatibili</p><p>2 0.92686588 <a title="1256-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-28-Pursue_robust_indefinite_scalability_with_the_Movable_Feast_Machine.html">1127 high scalability-2011-09-28-Pursue robust indefinite scalability with the Movable Feast Machine</a></p>
<p>Introduction: And now for something completely different, brought to you by David Ackley and Daniel Cannon in their playfully thought provoking paper:  Pursue robust indefinite scalability , wherein they try to take a fresh look at neural networks, starting from scratch.
 
What is this strange thing called  indefinite scalability ? They sound like words that don't really go together:
  

Indefinite scalability is the property that the design can support open-ended computational growth without substantial re-engineering, in as strict as sense as can be managed. By comparison, many computer, algorithm, and network designs -- even those that address scalability -- are only finitely scalable because their scalability occurs within some finite space. For example, an in-core sorting algorithm for a 32 bit machine can only scale to billions of numbers before address space is exhausted and then that algorithm must be re-engineered.


Our idea is to expose indefinitely scalable computational power to program</p><p>3 0.92086923 <a title="1256-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-31-NSFW%3A_Hilarious_Fault-Tolerance_Cartoon_.html">667 high scalability-2009-07-31-NSFW: Hilarious Fault-Tolerance Cartoon </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Another fun one...   Should I be Worried About Scaling?   What happens when the comfortable SQL world of yesterday changes out from under you? You feel like this (it uses some language picante so be advised):

A great way to communicate the dislocation one feels when technology changes. It also gets you to wonder if those changes at the user level are completely necessary for carrying out the task?  Lest you think this just an old guard reactionary sentiment, Boxed Ice chose  MongoDB over CouchDB  partly because "CouchDB requires map/reduce style queries which is much more complicated to work with."

<p>Introduction: It's a sad fact of life, but processes die. I know, it's horrible. You start them, send them out into process space, and hope for the best. Yet sometimes, despite your best coding, they core dump, seg fault, or some other calamity befalls them. Unlike our messy biological world so cruelly ruled by entropy, in the digital world processes can be given another chance. They can be restarted. A greater destiny awaits. And hopefully this time the random lottery of unforeseen killing factors will be avoided and a long productive life will be had by all.  This is fun code to write because it's a lot more complicated than you might think. And restarting processes is a highly effective high availability strategy. Most faults are transient, caused by an unexpected series of events. Rather than taking drastic action, like taking a node out of production or failing over, transients can be effectively masked by simply restarting failed processes.  Though complexity makes it a fun problem, it's also</p><p>5 0.91718549 <a title="1256-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-02-The_case_against_ORM_Frameworks_in_High_Scalability_Architectures.html">235 high scalability-2008-02-02-The case against ORM Frameworks in High Scalability Architectures</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Let me begin by saying that I have used and continue to use various ORM frameworks such as hibernate, ibatis, propel and activerecord in applications and websites that have a user base ranging from a couple hundred to 500k users.  Especially for projects that have to be up and running in a short duration of time, ORM frameworks significantly reduce the effort required to manipulate and persist OOP objects by providing time saving facilities such as automatically generated model objects, integrated unit testing,  secure variable substitution, etc. Hibernate even supports horizontal  data partitioning via Hibernate Shards.      However, the lay of the land is significantly different in the rarefied space occupied by applications needing to support millions of users. Profiling an application at this level and paying particular attention to the operations needed to move data to and from the database, it becomes evident that a significant portion of the operations are API related, whereby t</p><p>6 0.90720153 <a title="1256-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-05-Intercloud%3A_How_Will_We_Scale_Across_Multiple_Clouds%3F.html">803 high scalability-2010-04-05-Intercloud: How Will We Scale Across Multiple Clouds?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Real-time social graphs (connectivity between people, places, and things).
That's why scaling Facebook is hardsays Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of
Technology at Facebook. Social networking sites like Facebook, Digg, and
Twitter are simply harder than traditional websites to scale. Why is that? Why
would social networking sites be any more difficult to scale than traditional
web sites? Let's find out.Traditional websites are easier to scale than social
networking sites for two reasons:They usually access only their own data and
common cached data.Only 1-2% of users are active on the site at one
time.Imagine a huge site like Yahoo. When you come to Yahoo they can get your
profile record with one get and that's enough to build your view of the
website for you. It's relatively straightforward to scale systems based around
single records usingdistributed hashing schemes. And since only a few percent
of the people are on the site at once it takes comparatively little RAM cache
to handle a</p><p>5 0.16664572 <a title="1356-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-14-Scaling_Digg_and_Other_Web_Applications.html">512 high scalability-2009-02-14-Scaling Digg and Other Web Applications</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joe Stump, Lead Architect at Digg, gavethis presentationat the Web 2.0 Expo. I
couldn't find the actual presentation, but fortunatelyKris Jordantook some
great notes. That's how key moments in history are accidentally captured
forever. Joe was also kind enough to respond to my email questions with a
phone call.In this first part of the post Joe shares some timeless wisdom that
you may or may not have read before. I of course take some pains to extract
all the wit from the original presentation in favor of simple rules. What
really struck me however was how Joe thought MemcacheDBWill be the biggest new
kid on the block in scaling. MemcacheDB has been around for a little while and
I've never thought of it in that way. Well learn why Joe is so excited by
MemcacheDB at the end of the post.Impressive Stats80th-100th largest site in

<p>Introduction: Hey, this scaling stuff might just be important. Jim Scheinman, former Bebo
and Friendster exec, puts the blame squarely on Friendster's inability to
scale as why they lost the social networking race:VB: Can you tell me a bit
about what you learned in your time at Friendster? JS:For me, it basically
came down to failed execution on the technology side -- we had millions of
Friendster members begging us to get the site working faster so they could log
in and spend hours social networking with their friends. I remember coming in
to the office for months reading thousands of customer service emails telling
us that if we didn't get our site working better soon, they'd be 'forced to
join' a new social networking site that had just launched called MySpaceâ&euro;Śthe
rest is history. To be fair to Friendster's technology team at the time, they
were on the forefront of many new scaling and database issues that web sites
simply hadn't had to deal with prior to Friendster. As is often the case, the

<p>Introduction: Twitter has a big hairy audacious goal of reaching one billion users by 2013.
Three forces stand against Twitter. The world will end in2012. But let's be
optimistic and assume we'll make it. Next is Facebook. Currently Facebook is
the user leader with over 400 million users. Will Facebook stumble or will
they rocket to one billion users before Twitter? And lastly, there's Twitter's
"low" starting point and "slow" growth rate. Twitter currently has106
millionregistered users and adds about 300,000 new users a day. That doesn't
add up to a billion in three years. Twitter needs to triple the number of
registered users they add per day. How will Twitter reach its goal of over one
billion users served?From recent infrastructure announcements and information
gleaned atChirp (videos) and other talks, it has become a little clearer how
they hope to reach their billion user goal: 1) Make a Big Hairy Audacious Goal
2) Hire Lots of Quality People 3) Hug Developers and Users 4) Drive the

<p>Introduction: GridwiseTech hasdeveloped AdHoc, an advanced framework for sharing
geographically distributed data and compute resources. It simplifies the
resource management and makes cooperation secure and effective.The premise of
AdHoc is to enable each member of the associated institution to control access
to his or her resources without an IT administrator's help, and with high
security level of any exposed data or applications assured.It takes 3 easy
steps to establish cooperation within AdHoc: create a virtual organization,
add resources and share them. The application can be implemented within any
organization to exchange data and resources or between institutions to join
forces for more efficient results.AdHoc was initially created for a consortium
of hospitals and institutions to share medical data sets. As a technical
partner in that project, GridwiseTech implemented the Security Framework to
provide access to that data and designed a graphical tool to facilitate the
administration of the</p><p>4 0.91172981 <a title="1356-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-23-Postgresql_on_high_availability_websites%3F.html">73 high scalability-2007-08-23-Postgresql on high availability websites?</a></p>

(http://royal.pingdom.com/royalfiles/0702_infrastructure_matrix.pdf) and I saw
that no sites are using Postgresql, and then I searched through
highscalability.com and saw very few mentions of postgresql. Are there any
examples of high-traffic sites that use postgresql? Does anyone have any
experience with it? I'm having trouble finding good, recent studies of

<p>Introduction: Wired has awonderful interview with Clayton Christensen, author of the tech
ninja's bible, Innovator's Dilemma. Innovation is the name of the game in
Silicon Valley and if you want to understand the rules of the game this
article is a quick and clear way of learning. Everything is simply explained
with compelling examples by the man himself.Just as every empire has fallen,
every organization is open to disruption. It's the human condition to become
comfortable and discount potential dangers. It takes a great deal of
mindfulness to outwit and outlast the human condition. If you want to be the
disruptor and avoid being the disruptee, this is good stuff.He also talks
about his new book,The Capitalist's Dilemma, which addresses this puzzle: if
corporations are doing so well why are individuals doing so bad?If someone can
help you see a deep meaningful pattern in life then they haven't brought you a
fish, they've taught you how to fish. That's what Christensen does. Here's a
gloss of his wo</p><p>6 0.89667845 <a title="1356-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-06-10_Ways_to_Take_your_Site_from_One_to_One_Million_Users_by_Kevin_Rose__.html">715 high scalability-2009-10-06-10 Ways to Take your Site from One to One Million Users by Kevin Rose  </a></p>

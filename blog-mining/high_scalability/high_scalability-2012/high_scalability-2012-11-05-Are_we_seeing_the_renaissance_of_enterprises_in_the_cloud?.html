<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: When you're looking to add new tank mates to an existing aquarium ecosystem,
one of the concerns you must have is whether a particular breed of fish is
amenable to conspecific cohabitants. Many species are not, which means if you
put them together in a confined space, they're going to fight. Viciously. To
the death. Responsible aquarists try to avoid such situations, so careful
attention to theconspecificityof animals is a must.Now, while in many respects
the data center ecosystem correlates well to an aquarium ecosystem, in this
case it does not. It's what you usually get, today, but its not actually the
best model. That's because what you want in the data center ecosystem -
particularly when it extends to include publiccloud computingresources - is
conspecificity in infrastructure.This desire and practice is being seen both
in enterprise data center decision making as well as in startups suddenly
dealing with massive growth and increasingly encountering performance
bottlenecks over w</p><p>4 0.81965345 <a title="1354-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-31-Performance_in_the_Cloud%3A_Business_Jitter_is_Bad.html">1184 high scalability-2012-01-31-Performance in the Cloud: Business Jitter is Bad</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the benefits of web applications is that they are generally
transported via TCP, which is a connection-oriented protocol designed to
assure delivery. TCP has a variety of native mechanisms through which delivery
issues can be addressed - from window sizes to selective acks to idle time
specification to ramp up parameters. All these technical knobs and buttons
serve as a way for operators and administrators to tweak the protocol, often
at run time, to ensure the exchange of requests and responses upon which web
applications rely. This is unlike UDP, which is more of a "fire and forget"
protocol in which the server doesn't really care if you receive the data or
not.Now, voice and streaming video and audio over the web has always leveraged
UDP and thus it has always been highly sensitive to jitter. Jitter is, without
getting into layer one (physical) jargon, an undesirable delay in the
otherwise consistent delivery of packets. It causes the delay of and sometimes
outright loss of p</p><p>5 0.81576312 <a title="1354-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-18-The_Missing_Piece_in_the_Virtualization_Stack_%28Part_1%29.html">762 high scalability-2010-01-18-The Missing Piece in the Virtualization Stack (Part 1)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This and the next post will discuss how virtualization and cloud computing, as
we know it today, is only a small part of the solution for today's IT
inefficiencies. While new technologies and delivery models have made it much
simpler to manage the infrastructure, this is not where our core
inefficiencies lie. Virtualization principles must be extended to higher
levels of the application stack, to make it easier for all of us to manage,
tune and integrate applications. Otherwise we will continue to spend most of
our time on things that don't provide real value to the business.Read the full

<p>Introduction: Making the world's knowledge computableToday's Wolfram|Alpha is the first step
in an ambitious, long-term project to make all systematic knowledge
immediately computable by anyone. You enter your question or calculation, and
Wolfram|Alpha uses its built-in algorithms and growing collection of data to
compute the answer.Answer Engine vs Search EngineWhenWolfram|Alphalaunches
later today, it will beone of the most computationally intensive websites on
the internet. TheWolfram|Alpha computational knowledge engineis an "answer
engine" that is able to produce answers to various questions such asWhat is

<p>Introduction: A series of recent surveys on the subject seems to indicate that this is
indeed the case:Research conducted by HPfound that the majority of businesses
in the EMEA region are planning to move their mission-critical apps to the
cloud. Of the 940 respondents, 80 percent revealed plans to move mission-
critical apps at some point over the next two to five years.A more
recentsurvey, by research firm MeriTalkand sponsored by VMware and EMC
(NYSE:EMC), showed that one-third of respondents say they plan to move some
mission-critical applications to the cloud in the next year. Within two years,
the IT managers said they will move 26 percent of their mission-critical apps
to the cloud, and in five years, they expect 44 percent of their mission-
critical apps to run in the cloud.The Challenge - How to Bring Hundreds of
Enterprise Apps to the CloudThe reality is that cloud economics only start
making sense when there are true workloads that utilize the cloud
infrastructure.If the large majority of</p><p>3 0.93633902 <a title="1354-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-05-Oprah_is_the_Real_Social_Network.html">267 high scalability-2008-03-05-Oprah is the Real Social Network</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A lot of new internet TV station startups are in the wind these days and
there's a question about how they can scale their broadcasts. Today's state of
the art shows you can't yet mimic the reach of broadcast TV with internet
tech. But as Oprah proves, you can still capture a lot of eyeballs, if you are
Oprah...Oprah drew a stunning 500,000 simultaneous viewers for an Eckhart
Tolle webcast. Move Networks and Limelight Networks hosted the "broadcast"
where traffic peaked at 242Gbps. A variable bitrate scheme was used so
depending on their connection, a viewer could have seen 150Kbps or as high as
750Kbps.Dan Rayburn thinksThe big take away from this webcast is that it shows
proof that the Internet is not built to handle TV like distribution and those
who think that live TV shows will be broadcast on the Internet with millions
and millions of people watching, it's just not going to happen.breakTo handle
more users comments suggested capping the bitrate at 300K, using P2P

<p>Introduction: Sean Hallwith some really good MySQL advice: Tune those queries. Biggest bang
for your buck. Enable the slow query log and watch it. Once you've found a
heavy resource intensive query, optimize it! Tune what receives real-world
traffic. Employ Master-Master Replication. Immediately have a read-only slave
for your application to hit as well.Use Your Memory. Set
innodb_buffer_pool_size, key_buffer_size and other key options.RAID Your Disk
I/O. Use RAID 10 mirroring and striping. On EC2 striping across a number of
EBS volumes using the Linux md software raid.Tune Key Parameters. speeds up
inserts & updates with innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=2; create a tablespace
and underlying datafile for each table with innodb_file_per_table.Full details

<p>Introduction: I Want a New Data Store. Jeremy Zawodny of Craigslist wants a new database,
one that can do what it should: perform alter table operations faster, has
efficient queries when most of the data is on disk and not in RAM, and matches
their data that now looks more document oriented than relational. A lot of
people willing to help.Computer Science Unplugged. An extensive collection of
free resources that teach principles of Computer Science such asbinary
numbers,algorithmsanddata compressionthrough engaging games and puzzles that
use cards, string, crayons and lots of running around. And it's free!

<p>Introduction: A very entertaining and somewhat educational article onIBM Poopheads say LAMP
UsersNeed to "grow up". The physical three tier architecture turns out to be
the root of all evil and shared nothing architectures brings simplicity and
light.In the commentsSimon Willisonmakes an insightful comment on why fine
grained caching works for personalized pages and proxy's don't:Great post, but
I have to disagree with you on the finely grained caching part. If you look at
big LAMP deployments such as Flickr, LiveJournal and Facebook the common
technology component that enables them to scale is memcached - a tool for
finely grained caching. That's not to say that they aren't doing shared-
nothing, it's just that memcached is critical for helping the database layer
scale. LiveJournal serves around 50% of its page views "permission controlled"
(friends only) so an HTTP proxy on the front end isn't the right solution -
but memcached reduces their database hits by 90%.</p><p>4 0.11439276 <a title="1352-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-10-mixi.jp__Architecture.html">5 high scalability-2007-07-10-mixi.jp  Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mixi is a fast growing social networking site in Japan. They provide services
like: diary, community, message, review, and photo album. Having a lot in
common with LiveJournal they also developed many of the same approaches. Their
write up on how they scaled their system is easily one of the best out
there.Site: http://mixi.jpInformation Sourcesmixi.jp- scaling out with open

<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built
by a small group of people, under immense pressure, trying to get a lot of

<p>Introduction: Update:Final Thoughts on SSD and MySQL AKA Battleship Spinn3r. Tips on how to
make your database 10x faster using solid state drives. Potential exists for
100x speedup.Solid-state drives(SSDs) are the holy grail of storage. The
promise of RAM speeds and hard disk like persistence have for years driven us
crazy with power user lust, but they've stayed tantalizingly just out of
reach. Always too expensive, too small, and oddly too slow. Has that changed?
Can you now miraculously have your cake and eat it too? Can you now have it
both ways? Is balancing work with family life now as easy as tripping over a
terabyte drive?In a pioneering series of blog articles Kevin Burton conducts
original research on next generation SSD drives in real world configurations.

<p>Introduction: Adapted from their website:GlusterFSis a clustered file-system capable of
scaling to several peta-bytes. It aggregates various storage bricks over
Infiniband RDMA or TCP/IP interconnect into one large parallel network file
system. Storage bricks can be made of any commodity hardware such as x86-64
server with SATA-II RAID and Infiniband HBA).Cluster file systems are still
not mature for enterprise market. They are too complex to deploy and maintain
though they are extremely scalable and cheap. Can be entirely built out of
commodity OS and hardware. GlusterFS hopes to solves this problem.GlusterFS
achieved35 GBps read throughput. The GlusterFS Aggregated I/O Benchmark was
performed on 64 bricks clustered storage system over 10 Gbps Infiniband
interconnect. A cluster of 220 clients pounded the storage system with
multiple dd (disk-dump) instances, each reading / writing a 1 GB file with 1MB
block size. GlusterFS was configured with unify translator and round-robin
scheduler.The advantage</p><p>2 0.92365921 <a title="1352-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-06-Why_doesn%27t_anyone_use_j2ee%3F.html">82 high scalability-2007-09-06-Why doesn't anyone use j2ee?</a></p>

Java, but in a very pragmatic way. They use servlets, an application server,
the JDK, and they do the rest themselves. They skip JSP, entity beans, and
JMS.When you need to scale putting all your eggs in one basket is a risky
strategy. Why use JSP when you can do better? When use entity beans when you
can do better? Use servlets because they are a very effective way of handling
http requests. Use Java because it is fast, runs everywhere, and has a boat
load of libraries you can use to build your build your custom system.Probably
the major reason J2EE is absentee is simply LAMP. LAMP is just so incredibly
functional for most 2-tier shared nothing sites they don't need a better

<p>Introduction: This was the first architecture profile on HighScalability. IMHO LiveJournal
was really the start of the openness on how to build stuff at scale, setting
the whole industry off with an excellent role model. They wrote about their
architecture, they open sourced their tools, they showed that success wasn't
based on keeping secrets, and they set forth principles still followed by our
rather amazing industry. No other industry is so open and cooperative, with
their eyes cast so far forward, intent on building cool stuff. When all around
seems dark it would be good to keep this little bit of light in mind...A

<p>Introduction: FromWikipedia:SmartFrogis an open-source software framework, written in Java,
that manages the configuration, deployment and coordination of a software
system broken into components. These components may be distributed across
several network hosts. The configuration of components is described using a
domain-specific language, whose syntax resembles that of Java. It is a
prototype-based object-oriented language, and may thus be compared to Self.
The framework is used internally in a variety of HP products. Also, it is
being used by HP Labs partners like CERN.Related ArticlesDistributed Testing

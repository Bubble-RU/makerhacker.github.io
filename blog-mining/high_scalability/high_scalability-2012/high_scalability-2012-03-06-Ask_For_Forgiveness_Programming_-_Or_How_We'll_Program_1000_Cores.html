<p>Introduction: InfoQueue has thisexcellent talk by Brian Goetzon the new features being added
to Java SE 7 that will allow programmers to fully exploit our massively multi-
processor future. While the talk is about Java it's really more general than
that and there's a lot to learn here for everyone.Brian starts with a short,
coherent, and compelling explanation of why programmers can't expect to be
saved by ever faster CPUs and why we must learn to exploit the strengths of
multiple core computers to make our software go faster.Some techniques for
exploiting multiple cores are given in an equally short, coherent, and
compelling explanation of why divide and conquer as the secret to multi-core
bliss, fork-join, how the Java approach differs from map-reduce, and lots of
other juicy topics.The multi-core "problem" is only going to get worse. Tilera

<p>Introduction: Facebook has been so reliable that when a site outage does occur it's a
definite learning opportunity. Fortunately for us we can learn something
because in More Details on Today's Outage, Facebook'sRobert Johnson gave a
pretty candid explanation of what caused a rare 2.5 hour period of down time
for Facebook. It wasn't a simple problem. The root causes were feedback loops
and transient spikes caused ultimately by the complexity of weakly interacting
layers in modern systems. You know, the kind everyone is building these days.
Problems like this are notoriously hard to fix and finding a real solution may
send Facebook back to the whiteboard. There's a technical debt that must be
paid. The outline and my interpretation (reading between the lines) of what
happened is:Remember that Facebookcaches everything. They
have28terabytesofmemcacheddata on 800 servers. The database is the system of
record, but memory is where the action is. So when a problem happens that
involves the caching layer,</p><p>6 0.13857663 <a title="1204-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-09-Facebook_Uses_Non-Stored_Procedures_to_Update_Social_Graphs.html">936 high scalability-2010-11-09-Facebook Uses Non-Stored Procedures to Update Social Graphs</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Famous computer scientist John Backus, he's the B in BNF(Backus-Naur form) and
the creator of Fortran, gave a Turing Award Lecture titled Can programming be
liberated from the von Neumann style?: a functional style and its algebra of
programs, that has layed out a division in programming that lives long after
it was published in 1977. It's the now familiar argument for why functional
programming is superior:The assignment statement is the von Neumann bottleneck
of programming languages and keeps us thinking in word-at-a-time terms in much
the same way the computer's bottleneck does....The second world of
conventional programming languages is the world of statements. The primary
statement in that world is the assignment statement itself. All the other
statements of the language exist in order to make it possible to perform a
computation that must be based on this primitive construct: the assignment
statement.Here's a response by DijkstraA review of the 1977 Turing Award

<p>Introduction: The Declarative Imperative: Experiences and Conjectures in Distributed Logic
is written by UC Berkeley's Joseph Hellersteinfor a keynote speech he gave at
PODS. The video version of the talk is here. You may have heard about Mr.
Hellerstein through theBerkeley Orders Of Magnitude project (BOOM), whose
purpose is to help people build systems that are OOM (orders of magnitude)
bigger than are building today, with OOM less effort than traditional
programming methodologies. A noble goal which may be why BOOM was rated as a
top 10 emerging technology for 2010 byMIT Technology Review. Quite an
honor.The motivation for the talk is a familiar one: it's a dark period for
computer programming and if we don't learn how to write parallel programs the
children of Moore's law will destroy us all. We have more and more processors,
yet we are stuck on figuring out how the average programmer can exploit them.

<p>Introduction: I love it when a somewhat older article like Pinterest Cut Costs From $54 To
$20 Per Hour By Automatically Shutting Down Systems hits Hacker News and
generates agood conversation. One of the common sentiments about the cloud was
raised: why doesn't Pinterest save a lot of money by running their own
hardware instead of using the cloud?Ryan Park, Operations Engineer at
Pinterest, responds in what I think is the perfectmodern responseto that
ultimate existential design dilemma:Our #1 requirement has been to keep up
with the growth in traffic on the site. We've been growing so fast that
there's literally no way we could have ordered and racked equipment fast
enough. We were also a very small team -- a year ago there were only about a
dozen people in the whole company. At this point we're much larger, which
gives us room to consider more options like colo or multiple cloud
providers.AWS certainly feels pretty costly when you compare colo prices to
the list price for on-demand instances.

<p>Introduction: There's a popular line of thought that says don't waste time on optimization
because developing features is more important than saving money. True, you can
always add resources, but at some point, especially in a more mature part of a
product lifecycle: performance equals $$$.Two great examples of this evolution
come from Facebook and Google. The upshot is that when you spend time and
money on optimizing your tool chain you can get huge wins in performance,
control, and costs. Certainly, don't bother if you are just starting, but at
some point you may want to switch to big development efforts in improving
efficiency.Facebook and HipHopThe Facebook example is quite well known:HipHop,
a static PHP compiler released in 2010, after two years of development. PHP
because Facebook implements their web tierin PHP. They've now developed a
dynamic compiler,HipHop VM, using techniques like JIT, side exits, HipHop
bytecode, type prediction, and parallel tracelet linking.This is an incredible

<p>Introduction: The argument for a massively multicore future is now familiar: while clock
speeds have leveled off, device density is increasing, so the future is cheap
chips with hundreds and thousands of cores. That's the inexorable logic behind
our multicore future.The unsolved question that lurks deep in the dark part of
a programmer's mind is: how on earth are we to program these things? For
problems that aren'tembarrassingly parallel, we really have no idea. IBM
Research'sDavid Ungarhas an idea. And it's radical in the extreme...Grace
Hopperonce advised "It's easier to ask for forgiveness than it is to get
permission." I wonder if she had any idea that her strategy for dealing with
human bureaucracy would the same strategy David Ungar thinks will help us tame
the technological bureaucracy of 1000+ core systems?You may recognize David as
the co-creator of theSelf programminglanguage, inspiration for the HotSpot
technology in the JVM and the prototype model used by Javascript. He's also

<p>Introduction: Update:Final Thoughts on SSD and MySQL AKA Battleship Spinn3r. Tips on how to
make your database 10x faster using solid state drives. Potential exists for
100x speedup.Solid-state drives(SSDs) are the holy grail of storage. The
promise of RAM speeds and hard disk like persistence have for years driven us
crazy with power user lust, but they've stayed tantalizingly just out of
reach. Always too expensive, too small, and oddly too slow. Has that changed?
Can you now miraculously have your cake and eat it too? Can you now have it
both ways? Is balancing work with family life now as easy as tripping over a
terabyte drive?In a pioneering series of blog articles Kevin Burton conducts
original research on next generation SSD drives in real world configurations.

<p>Introduction: Lukas Biewald shares a fascinatingslam by slam recountof how
hisFaceStat(upload your picture and be judged by the masses) site was battered
by a link on Yahoo's main page that caused an almost instantaneous 650,000
page view jump on their site. Yahoo spends considerable effort making sure its
own properties can handle the truly massive flow from the main page. Turning
theGreat Eyeof the Internet towards an unsuspecting newborn site must be quite
the diaper ready experience. Theo Schlossnagle eerily prophesized about such
events inThe Implications of Punctuated Scalabilium for Website Architecture:
massive, unexpected and sudden traffic spikes will become more common as a
fickle internet seeks ever for new entertainments (my summary). Exactly
FaceStat's situation.This is also one of our first exposures to an application
written on Merb, a popular Ruby on Rails competitor. For those who think Ruby
is the problem, their architecture now serves 100 times the original load.How

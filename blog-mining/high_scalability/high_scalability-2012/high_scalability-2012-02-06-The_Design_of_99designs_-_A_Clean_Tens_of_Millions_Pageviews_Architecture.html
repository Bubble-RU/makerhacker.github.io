<p>Introduction: If you are looking for an excellent overview of general architecture
principles then take a look at Will Larson's Introduction to Architecting
Systems for Scale. Based on his experiences at Yahoo! and Digg, Will covers
key concepts in some depth. A quick gloss on the building blocks:Load
Balancing: Scalability & Redundancy.Horizontal scalability and redundancy are
usually achieved via load balancing, the spreading of requests across multiple
resources.Smart Clients.The client has a list of hosts and load balances
across that list of hosts. Upside is simple for programmers. Downside is it's
hard to update and change.Hardware Load Balancers.Targeted at larger
companies, this is dedicated load balancing hardware. Upside is performance.
Downside is cost and complexity.Software Load Balancers.The recommended
approach, it's  software that handles load balancing, health checks,
etc.Caching.Make better use of resources you already have. Precalculate
results for later use.

Facebook for a ton of money. A coincidence? You be the judge.Just what is

hardware. Its mode of operation makes its integration into existing
architectures very easy and riskless, while still offering the possibility not

than 33 million sites attracting over 339 million people and 3.4 billion pages
each month. Since April 2008, WordPress.com has experienced about 4.4 times
growth in page views. WordPress.com VIP hosts many popular sites including
CNN's Political Ticker, NFL, Time Inc's The Page, People Magazine's Style
Watch, corporate blogs for Flickr and KROQ, and many more. Automattic operates
two thousand servers in twelve, globally distributed, data centers.
WordPress.com customer data is instantly replicated between different
locations to provide an extremely reliable and fast web experience for
hundreds of millions of visitors.ProblemWordPress.com, which began in 2005,

Viera, VP of Engineering at Pixable.Pixableaggregates photos from across your
different social networks and finds the best ones so you never miss an
important moment. That means currently processing the metadata of more than 20
million new photos per day: crawling, analyzing, ranking, and sorting them
along with the other 5+ billion that are already stored in our database.
Making sense of all that data has challenges, but two in particular rise above

<p>Introduction: It's hardly news to anyone that product development and testing involve a lot
of boring routine work, which can lead to human error. To avoid complications
stemming from this, we use AIDA.AIDA(Automated Interactive Deploy Assistant)
is a utility that automatically performs many of the processes in Git,
TeamCity and JIRA.In this post, we focus on how through using AIDA we were
able to automate multiple workflows and create a scheme of continuous
integration.We'll start by looking at the version control system (VCS) we use
here at Badoo, specifically how Git is used to automate creation of release
branches, and their subsequent merging. Then we'll discuss AIDA's major
contribution to both JIRA integration and TeamCity.Git flowThe Badoo Team uses
Git as a version control system. Our model ensures each task is developed and
tested in a separate branch. The branch name consists of the ticket number in
JIRA and a description of the problem.BFG-

their own study HostedFTP.com has found: 10 to 12 MB/second when storing and

Storage Solutions. S3 isn't the only cloud storage service out there. Mosso is
saying they can save you so money while offering support. There are number of
scenarios in their paper, but For 5TB of cloud storage Mosso will save you 17%
over S3 without support and 42% with support. For their CDN on a Global test
Mosso says the average response time is 333ms for CloudFront vs. 107ms for
Cloud Files which means globally, Cloud Files is 3.1 times or 211% faster than
CloudFront.Amazon S3is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-
scale computing easier for developers.This service allows you to link directly
to files at a cost of 15 cents per GB of storage, and 20 cents per GB

Theorem: A Proposed Theorem for the Trade-offs in Horizontally Scalable Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Successful software design is all about trade-offs. In the typical (if there
is such a thing) distributed system, recognizing the importance of trade-offs
within the design of your architecture is integral to the success of your
system. Despite this reality, I see time and time again, developers choosing a
particular solution based on an ill-placed belief in their solution as a
“silver bullet”, or a solution that conquers all, despite the inevitable
occurrence of changing requirements. Regardless of the reasons behind this
phenomenon, I’d like to outline a few of the methods I use to ensure that I’m
making good scalable decisions without losing sight of the trade-offs that
accompany them. I’d also like to compile (pun intended) the issues at hand, by
formulating a simple theorem that we can use to describe this oft occurring
situation.</p><p>6 0.93612456 <a title="1188-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-17-Stuff_the_Internet_Says_on_Scalability_For_December_17th%2C_2010.html">959 high scalability-2010-12-17-Stuff the Internet Says on Scalability For December 17th, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In  MemSQL Architecture  we learned one of the core strategies MemSQL uses to achieve their need for speed is lock-free skip lists. Skip lists are used to efficiently handle range queries. Making the skip-lists lock-free helps eliminate contention and make writes fast. 
 
If this all sounds a little pie-in-the-sky then here's a very good paper on the subject that might help make it clearer:  A Provably Correct Scalable Concurrent Skip List .
 
From the abstract:
  We propose a new concurrent skip list algorithm distinguished by a combination of simplicity and scalability. The algorithm employs optimistic synchronization, searching without acquiring locks, followed by short lock-based validation before adding or removing nodes. It also logically removes an item before physically unlinking it. Unlike some other concurrent skip list algorithms, this algorithm preserves the skiplist properties at all times, which facilitates reasoning about its correctness. Experimental evidence shows that</p><p>4 0.14389315 <a title="1304-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-09-Need_Help_with_Database_Scalability%3F_Understand_I-O.html">1514 high scalability-2013-09-09-Need Help with Database Scalability?

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Zardosht Kasheff , Software Developer at  Tokutek , a storage engine company that delivers 21st-Century capabilities to the leading open source data management platforms. 
 
As software developers, we value abstraction. The simpler the API, the more attractive it becomes. Arguably, MongoDB’s greatest strengths are its elegant API and its   agility  , which let developers simply code.
 
But when  MongoDB  runs into scalability problems on  big data , developers need to peek underneath the covers to understand the underlying issues and how to fix them. Without understanding, one may end up with an inefficient solution that costs time and money. For example, one may shard prematurely, increasing hardware and management costs, when a simpler replication setup would do. Or, one may increase the size of a replica set when upgrading to SSDs would suffice.

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.   Let's take a short trip down web architecture lane:
  It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl scripts and a SQL database   It's 1995: Scale-up the database.   It's 1998: LAMP   It's 1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SAN   It's 2001: In-memory data-grid.   It's 2003: Add a caching layer.   It's 2004: Add scale-out and partitioning.   It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a distributed file system.   It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.

<p>Introduction: I recently came across a TPC-C benchmark results held on MySQL based RDS databases. You can see it  here . I think the results may bring light to many questions concerning MySQL scalability in general and RDS scalability in particular. (For disclosure, I'm working for  ScaleBase  where we run an internal scale out TPC-C benchmark these days, and will publish results soon).
  TPC-C  
TPC-C is a standard database benchmark, used to measure databases. The database vendors invest big bucks in running this test, and showing off which database is faster, and can scale better.
 
It is a write intensive test, so it doesn’t necessarily reflect the behavior of the database in your application. But it does give some very important insights on what you can expect from your database under heavy load.
  The Benchmark Process  
First of all, I have some comments for the benchmark method itself.
  
 Generally - the benchmarks were held in an orderly fashion and in a rather methodological way – which i</p><p>3 0.82058513 <a title="1304-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-10-Database_Isolation_Levels_And_Their_Effects_on_Performance_and_Scalability.html">986 high scalability-2011-02-10-Database Isolation Levels And Their Effects on Performance and Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Some of us are not aware of the tremendous job databases perform, particularly their efforts to maintain the Isolation aspect of ACID. For example, some people believe that transactions are only related to data manipulation and not to queries, which is an incorrect assumption. Transaction Isolation is all about queries, and the consistency and completeness of the data retrieved by queries. This is how it works:
 
Isolation gives the querying user the feeling that he owns the database. It does not matter that hundreds or thousands of concurrent users work with the same database and the same schema (or even the same data). These other uses can generate new data, modify existing data or perform any other action. The querying user must be able to get a complete, consistent picture of the data, unaffected by other users’ actions.
 
Let’s take the following scenario, which is based on an Orders table that has 1,000,000 rows, with a disk size of 20 GB:
  
 8:00: UserA started a query “SELECT</p><p>4 0.80243361 <a title="1304-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-10-LevelDB_-_Fast_and_Lightweight_Key-Value_Database_From_the_Authors_of_MapReduce_and_BigTable.html">1096 high scalability-2011-08-10-LevelDB - Fast and Lightweight Key-Value Database From the Authors of MapReduce and BigTable</a></p>
<p>Introduction: LevelDB  is an exciting new entrant into the pantheon of embedded databases, notable both for its pedigree, being authored by the makers of the now mythical Google MapReduce and BigTable products, and for its emphasis on efficient disk based random access using log-structured-merge (LSM) trees. 
 
The plan is to keep LevelDB fairly low-level. The intention is that it will be a useful building block for higher-level storage systems. Basho is  already investigating  using LevelDB as one if its storage engines.
 
In the past many systems were built around embedded databases, though most developers now use database servers connected to via RPCs. An embedded database is a database distributed as a library and linked directly into your application.

<p>Introduction: What do you get when you take a SQL database and start a new implementation from scratch, taking advantage of the latest research and modern hardware?  Mike Stonebraker , the sword wielding Johnny Appleseed of the database world, hopes you get something like his new database,  VoltDB : a pure SQL, pure ACID, pure OLTP, shared nothing, sharded, scalable, lockless, open source, in-memory DBMS, purpose-built for running hundreds of thousands of transactions a second. VoltDB  claims to be  100 times faster than MySQL, up to 13 times faster than  Cassandra , and 45 times faster than Oracle, with near-linear scaling.
  Will VoltDB kill off the new NoSQL upstarts? Will VoltDB cause a mass extinction of ancient databases? Probably no and no to both questions, but it's a product with a definite point-of-view and is worth a look as the transaction component in your system. But will it be right for you? Let's see...

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectives  is a series of posts that highlights the ideas that will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires an open mind. Warning #2: this post is wild.     Kevin Kelly    Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He helped launch Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor until January 1999. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers' Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985.

<p>Introduction: This is an interview with   MemSQL    cofounder’s    Eric Frenkiel    and    Nikita Shamgunov   , in which they try to answer critics by going into more depth about their technology.     MemSQL ruffled a few feathers with their claim of being the fastest database in the world. According to their benchmarks MemSQL can execute 200K TPS on an EC2   Quadruple   Extra Large   and on a 64 core machine they can push 1.2 million transactions a second.     Benchmarks are always a dark mirror, so make of them what you will, but the target market for MemSQL is clear: projects looking for something both fast and familiar. Fast as in a novel design using a combination of technologies like    MVCC   , code generation,    lock-free data structures   ,    skip lists   , and    in-memory execution   . Familiar as in SQL and nothing but SQL. The only interface to MemSQL is SQL.    It’s right to point out MemSQL gets a boost by being a first release.

We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance. Not only this, but through television and telephony we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of miles; and the instruments through which we shall be able to do this will be amazingly simple compared with our present telephone.

<p>Introduction: Update 2:  Presentation from the  NoSQL conference :  slides ,  video .  Update:   Why you won't be building your killer app on a distributed hash table  by Jonathan Ellis.  Why I think Cassandra is the most promising of the open-source distributed databases --you get a relatively rich data model and a distribution model that supports efficient range queries. These are not things that can be grafted on top of a simpler DHT foundation, so Cassandra will be useful for a wider variety of applications.    James Hamilton has published a thorough summary of Facebook's Cassandra, another scalable key-value store for your perusal. It's open source and is described as a "BigTable data model running on a Dynamo-like infrastructure." Cassandra is used in Facebook as an email search system containing 25TB and over 100m mailboxes.

<p>Introduction: In  Log Everything All the Time  I advocate applications shouldn't bother logging at all. Why waste all that time and code? No, wait, that's not right. I preach logging everything all the time. Doh. Facebook obviously feels similarly which is why they opened sourced  Scribe , their internal logging system, capable of logging 10s of billions of messages per day. These messages include access logs, performance statistics, actions that went to News Feed, and many others.   Imagine hundreds of thousands of machines across many geographical dispersed datacenters just aching to send their precious log payload to the central repository off all knowledge. Because really, when you combine all the meta data with all the events you pretty much have a complete picture of your operations. Once in the central repository logs can be scanned, indexed, summarized, aggregated, refactored, diced, data cubed, and mined for every scrap of potentially useful information.

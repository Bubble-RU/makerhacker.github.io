<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byShawn Hsiao,Luke Massa, andVictor Luu. Shawn
runsTripAdvisor's Technical Operations team, Luke and Victor interned on his
team this past summer. This post is introduced byAndy Gelfond, TripAdvisor's
head of engineering.It's been a little over a year since our last post about
theTripAdvisor architecture. It has been an exciting year. Our business and
team continues to grow, we are now an independent public company, and we have
continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown -
we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work
across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:56M visitors per
month350M+ pages requests a day120TB+ of warehouse data running on a large
Hadoop cluster, and quickly growingWe also had a very successful college
intern program that brought on over 60 interns this past summer, all who were

<p>Introduction: Hi,we've got a web application, which runs without the common standalone
application servers like tomcat or jboss, rather it runs with an embedded
jetty server. Now we are planing to run instances of this application on
multiple machines, with a load balancer serving the requests.The big question
is: is there a common scenario on how to update these applications? Lets think
of 10 instances on 10 machines (one instance per machine), where we want to
update each of these applications version. The brute force approach would be,
to stop all instances, update and then restart it. This is a lot of manual
work ;) Another problem is down-time: so someone must only shutdown one server
after another, but then there are multiple application versions around.Can
someone please provide us with a hint for this problem? Perhaps papers, tools
or something like that?Thanks a lot :)</p><p>4 0.14587678 <a title="1286-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-08-Cloud_AWS_Infrastructure_vs._Physical_Infrastructure.html">853 high scalability-2010-07-08-Cloud AWS Infrastructure vs. Physical Infrastructure</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byFrederic Faure(architect atYsance)on the differences
between using a cloud infrastructure and building your own. Frederic was kind
enough to translate the original French version of this article into
English.I've been noticing many questions about the differences inherent in
choosing between a Cloud infrastructure such asAWS(Amazon Web Services) and a
traditional physical infrastructure. Firstly, there are a certain number of
preconceived notions on this subject that I will attempt to decode for you.
Then, it must be understood that each infrastructure has its advantages and
disadvantages: a Cloud-type infrastructure does not necessarily fulfill your
requirements in every case, however, it can satisfy some of them by optimizing
or facilitating the features offered by a traditional physical infrastructure.
I will therefore demonstrate the differences between the two that I have
noticed, in order to help you make up your own mind.The FrameworkCloudThere

<p>Introduction: With a new Planet of the Apes coming out, this may be a touchy subject with
our new overlords, but Netflix is using a whole lot more trouble injecting
monkeys to test and iteratively harden their systems. We learned previously
how Netflix used Chaos Monkey, a tool to test failover handling by
continuously failing EC2 nodes. That was just a start. More monkeys have been
added to the barrel. Node failure is just one problem in a system. Imagine a
problem and you can imagine creating a monkey to test if your system is
handling that problem properly. Yury Izrailevsky talks about just this
approach in this very interesting post: The Netflix Simian Army.I know what
you are thinking, if monkeys are so great then why has Netflix been down
lately. Dmuino addressedthis potential embarrassment, putting all fears of
cloud inferiority to rest:Unfortunately we're not running 100% on the cloud
today. We're working on it, and we could use more help. The latest outage was
caused by a component that sti</p><p>6 0.13341297 <a title="1286-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-05-10_Things_You_Should_Know_About_AWS.html">1543 high scalability-2013-11-05-10 Things You Should Know About AWS</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Authored by Chris Fregly:  Former Netflix Streaming Platform Engineer, AWS
Certified Solution Architect and Purveyor of fluxcapacitor.com.Ahead of the
upcoming 2nd annual re:Invent conference, inspired by Simone Brunozzi's
recentpresentationat an AWS Meetup in San Francisco, and collected from a few
of my recentFluxcapacitor.com consulting engagements, I've compiled a list of
10 useful time and clock-tick saving tips about AWS.1) Query AWS resource
metadata Can't remember the EBS-Optimized IO throughput of your c1.xlarge
cluster?  How about the size limit of an S3 object on a single PUT?
awsnow.infois the answer to all of your AWS-resource metadata questions.
Interested in integrating awsnow.info with your application?  You're in luck.
There's now aREST API, as well!Note:  These are default soft limits and will
vary by account.2) Tame your S3 buckets Delete an entire S3 bucket with a

<p>Introduction: Vaibhav PuranikinWeb serving in the cloud - our experiences with nginx and
instance sizesdescribes their experience trying to maximum traffic and minimum
their web serving costs on EC2. Initially they tested with two m1.small
instance types and then they the switched to two c1.mediums instance types.
The m1s are the standard instance types and the c1s are the high CPU instance
types. Obviously the mediums have greater capability, but the cost difference
was interesting:In the long term they will save money using the larger
instances and not autoscaling. With the small instances, traffic bursts caused
autoscaling to kick in. New instances were started in response to load. The
instances woud be up for a short period of time and then spin down again. This
constant churn costs a lot of money. Selecting the larger instance sizes,
which are capable of handling the load without autoscaling, turn out to save
money even though they are more expensive. Starting new instances also takes a
few min</p><p>4 0.81428313 <a title="1286-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-18-Save_up_to_30%25_by_Selecting_Better_Performing_Amazon_Instances.html">1343 high scalability-2012-10-18-Save up to 30% by Selecting Better Performing Amazon Instances</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you like the idea of exploiting market inconsistencies to lower your costs
then you will love thispaperand video from the Hot Cloud '12
conference:Exploiting Hardware Heterogeneity within the Same Instance Type of
Amazon EC2.The conclusion is interesting and is a source of good
guidance:Amazon EC2 uses diversified hardware to host the same type of
instance.  The hardware diversity results in performance variation.In general,
the variation between the fast instances and slow  instances can reach 40%. In
some applications, the variation can even approach up to 60%.  By selecting
fast instances within the same instance type,  Amazon EC2 users can acquire up
to 30% of cost saving, if the fast instances have a relatively low
probability.The abstract:Cloud computing providers might start with near-
homogeneous hardware environment. Over time, the homogeneous environment will
most likely evolve into heterogeneous one because of possible upgrades and
replacement of outdated hardware.

<p>Introduction: We've long known one of the virtues of the cloud is, through the magic of
services and automation, that systems can be shut or tuned down when not in
use. What may be surprising is how much money can be saved. This aspect of
cloudiness got a lot of pub atAWS re:Invent and is being rebranded under the
term Cost-Aware Architecture. Aninteresting examplewas given by Ryan Park,
Pinterest's technical operations lead:20% of their systems are shutdown after
hours in response to traffic loadsReserved instances are used for standard
traffic On-demand and spot instances are used to handle the elastic load
throughout the day. When more servers are needed for an auto-scaled service,
spot requests are opened and on-demand instances are started at the same time.
Most services are targeted to run at about 50% on-demand and 50% spot.Watchdog
processes continually check what's running. More instances are launched when
needed and terminated when not needed. If spot prices spike and spot instances

<p>Introduction: One of the most popular and effective scalability strategies is to impose
limits (GAE Quotas,Fotolog,Facebook) as a means of protecting a website
against service destroyingtraffic spikes. Twitter will reportedlylimit the
number followersto 2,000 in order to thwart follow spam. This may also allow
Twitter to make some bank bygoing freemiumand charging for adding more
followers.Agree or disagree with Twitter's strategies, the more interesting
aspect for me is how do you introduce new policies into an already established
ecosystem?One approach is the big bang. Introduce all changes at once and let
everyone adjust. If users don't like it they can move on. The hope is,
however, most users won't be impacted by the changes and that those who are
will understand it's all for the greater good of their beloved service.
Casualties are assumed, but the damage will probably be minor.Now in Twitter's
case the people with the most followers tend to be opinion leaderswho shape
much of the blognet echo</p><p>2 0.90774524 <a title="1286-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-18-How_to_deal_with_an_I-O_bottleneck_to_disk%3F.html">251 high scalability-2008-02-18-How to deal with an I-O bottleneck to disk?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A site I'm working with has an I/O bottleneck.They're using a static server to
deliver all of the pictures/video content/zip downloads ecetera but now that
the bandwith out of that server is approaching 50Mbit/second the latency on
serving small files has increased to become unacceptable.I'm curious how other
people have dealt with this situation.Seperating into two different servers
would require a significant change to the sites architecutre (because the
premise is that all uploads go into one server, all subdirectorie are created
in one directory, etc.) and may not really solve the problem.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.89737087 <a title="1286-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-18-Strategy%3A_Kill_Off_Multi-tenant_Instances_with_High_CPU_Stolen_Time.html">1286 high scalability-2012-07-18-Strategy: Kill Off Multi-tenant Instances with High CPU Stolen Time</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Are all instances created equal? Perhaps because under multi-tenancy multiple
virtual machines run on the same physical host, not all applications will run
equally well on every instance. In that case it makes sense to measure and
move to a better performing instance. That's the interesting idea
from@botchagalupe:Imagine something like a "performance monkey" where an
infrastructure is so bound that it can kill lower performing instances
automatically.@adriancosays Netflix has throught of doing the same: We've
looked at killing off multi-tenant instances that have high CPU stolen
time...Related ArticlesHost server CPU utilization in Amazon EC2 cloud</p><p>4 0.87342203 <a title="1286-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-02-It_Must_be_Crap_on_Relational_Dabases_Week_.html">648 high scalability-2009-07-02-It Must be Crap on Relational Dabases Week </a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's hard to be a relational database lately. After years of faithful service
everywhere you look the world is turning against you:Recently at theNoSQL
conference150 revolutionaries met with their new anti-RDBMS arms suppliers.
And you know what happens when revolutionaries are motivated, educated,
funded, and well armed.The revolution has gone mainstream when Computerworld
writesNo to SQL? Anti-database movement gains steam. It's not just whispers
anymore, it's everywhere.And perennial revolutionary Michael Stonebraker runs
from blog to blog shouting theThe End of a DBMS Era (Might be Upon Us).
Relational vendors are selling legacy software, are 50x slower than other
alternatives, and that can not stand.The Greek Chorus onHacker Newssings of
anger and lies.Certainly some say stick with the past. It's your fault, you
aren't doing it right, give us another chance and all will be as it ever was.
Some smirk saying this is nothing but a return to a more ancient time when IBM
was King.But i</p><p>5 0.86684489 <a title="1286-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-24-Advertise.html">287 high scalability-2008-03-24-Advertise</a></p>

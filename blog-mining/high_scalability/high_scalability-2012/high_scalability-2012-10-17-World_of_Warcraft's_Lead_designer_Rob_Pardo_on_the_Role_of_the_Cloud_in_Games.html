hurdles for cloud gaming to overcome, one of which is having to have all these

<p>Introduction: "Everything in war is simple, but theďťż simplest thing is difficult." -- Carl
von ClausewitzGames are proving grounds for software architecture. They
combine scale, high performance, challenging problems, a rabid user base, cost
sensitivity, and the need for profit. And when games have in-game currency,
like EVE Online has, there's money at play, so you can't just get away with a
c'est la vie attitude. Engineering must be applied. InPlanning for war: how
the EVE Online servers deal with a 3,000 person battle, we learn some
techniques EVE Online uses to handle large games:7 Sensible...Do nothing.Most
games are manageable or have spikes that quickly dissipate. Run it Hot.
There's nothing to throttle as servers run at 100%. Why waste money? Use all
your CPU.Shard it. Games are sharded by solar system and multiple solar

<p>Introduction: Ashleigh Anderson from Zynga let me know that they have an opening for a
Systems Engineer working on some new games they are developing. Given the
state of the job market I thought it worth posting. Here are more
details...Zynga is looking for a strong server-side Systems Engineer to join
our growing team! You'll be responsible for owning the development, deployment
and administration of our up-and-coming games. Are you ready to put your ideas
into our games that will be viewed instantly by millions?  We are committed to
developing high quality casual and multi player games! Come join us ... we're
having a ball!  Responsibilities:  The best candidates will have solid
experience developing, deploying and administering web applications utilizing
Web 2.0 technologies. You will be joining a team who's committed to working on
high quality code in a PHP/LAMP.  You must have experience with database-

Laboratories* The computational environment for online games or virtual worlds
is close to the exact inverse of that found in most markets serviced by the
high-tech industry.* The need for a heavyweight client is, in part, an outcome
of the evolution of these games.* Latency is the enemy of fun—and therefore
the enemy of online games and virtual worlds.* The game server is used both to
discourage cheating (by making it much more difficult) and to detect cheating
(by seeing patterns of divergence between the game state reported by the
client and the game state held by the server). Peer-to-peer technologies might

<p>Introduction: Update:As expected I'm undergoing a massive spam attack for speaking truth to
dark powers. This is the time to be strong. Together we can make a change.
What change you may ask? I can't say, just change and lots more change. Let's
link arms together and bravely stand against the forces of chaos for a better
yesterday and a better tomorrow.CAPTCHA doesn't work. Even Google can't make
CAPTCHA work (Spammers Choose GMail). And even if CAPTCHA worked it wouldn't
really work because CAPTCHA solving markets (Inside India's CAPTCHA solving
economy) have evolved where for a mere $2 you can buy 1000 human broken
CAPTCHA's. And we know once the free market tackles a problem that's it. Game
over :-)Making ever more clever CAPTCHA programs won't outwit and outlast the
CAPTCHA solving markets. Until Skynet evolves the only way to defeat humans is

<p>Introduction: Cloud bursting is an application deployment model in which an application runs
in a private cloud or data center and bursts into a public cloud when the
demand for computing capacity spikes. The advantage of such a hybrid cloud
deployment is that an organization only pays for extra compute resources when
they are needed. (Source: SearchCloudComputing)Neal Sample the former CTO -
X.commerce at eBay gave an interesting talk last year on the economic benefit
of Cloud Bursting. Neal pointed out eBay traffic statistics and showed some
real numbers of the business impact of bursting peak load activities using on-
demand cloud resources as presented in the diagram from his talk.In order to
use cloud bursting effectively we need to address the following set of
challenges:Workload migration- specifically the ability to clone our

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post about how boring and repetitive HA and scalability
problems can be solved via Open Source so you can focus on the interesting
tasks. The post was written byMaarten Ectors, responsible for Cloud Strategy
andFrank Mueller, a Juju Core developer, at Ubuntu/Canonical.High-availability
and scalability are exciting in general but there are certain problems that
experts see over and over again. The list is long but examples are setting up
MySQL clustering, sharding Mongo, adding data nodes to a Hadoop cluster,
monitoring with Ganglia, building continuous deployment solutions, integrating
Memcached / Varnish / Nginx,â&euro;Ś Why are we reinventing the wheel?At Ubuntu we
made it our goal to have the community solve these repetitive and often boring
tasks. How often have you had to set-up MySQL replication and scale it? What

<p>Introduction: The Relational Cloud Project is an effort by a group of researchers at MIT to
investigate technologies and challenges related to Database-as-a-Service
within cloud-computing. They are trying to figure out how the advantages of
the DaaS (Database-as-a-Service) model, that we've seen arise in other areas
like OLAP and NoSQL, can be applied to relational databases. The DaaS
advantages as they see them are: 1) predictable costs, proportional to the
quality of service and actual workloads, 2) lower technical complexity, thanks
to a unified and simplified service access interface, and 3) virtually
infinite resources ready at hand. An interesting description of their approach
is explained in the paper Relational Cloud: A Database-as-a-Service for the
Cloud. From the abstract:This paper introduces a new transactional "database-
as-a-service" (DBaaS) called Relational Cloud. A DBaaS promises to move much

<p>Introduction: This presentation illustrates how one can scale EXISTING JEE application and
deploy it on Amazon cloud usingGigaSpaces as the scale-out application
serverwhile:* Not having to re-write your application* Preventing lock-in to
specific cloud provider* Enabling seamless portability between your local
environment to cloud environmento No code or configuration change is required
between the two environmentso Develop local - test on the cloudo Built for
iterative development</p><p>6 0.73119479 <a title="1309-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-04-Its_time_for_auto_scaling_%E2%80%93_avoid_peak_load_provisioning_for_web_applications.html">524 high scalability-2009-03-04-Its time for auto scaling – avoid peak load provisioning for web applications</a></p>

<p>Introduction: An interesting and different implementation approach: Tempest: Scalable Time-
Critical Web Services Platform: Tempest is a new framework for developing
time-critical web services. Tempest enables developers to build scalable,
fault-tolerant services that can then be automatically replicated and deployed
across clusters of computing nodes. The platform automatically adapts to load
ďŹ&sbquo;uctuations, reacts when components fail, and ensures consistency between
replicas by repairing when inconsistencies do occur. Tempest relies on a
family of epidemic protocols and on Ricochet, a reliable time critical
multicast protocol with probabilistic guarantees.Tempest is built around a
novel storage abstraction called the TempestCollection in which application
developers store the state of a service. Our platform handles the replication
of this state across clones of the service, persistence, and failure handling.
To minimize the need for specialized knowledge on the part of the application
developer, th</p><p>2 0.94459057 <a title="1309-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-24-4_New_Podcasts_for_Scalable_Summertime_Reading.html">864 high scalability-2010-07-24-4 New Podcasts for Scalable Summertime Reading</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's trendy today to say "I don't read blogs anymore, I just let the random
chance of my social network guide me to new and interesting content." #fail.
While someone says this I imagine them flicking their hair back in a "I can't
be bothered with true understanding" disdain. And where does random chance get
its content? From people like these. So:support your local blog!If you would
like to be a part of random chance, here are a few new podcasts/blogs/vidcasts
that you may not know about and that I've found interesting:DevOps Cafe. With
thisnew video series where John and Damon visit high performing companies and
record an insider's tour of the tools and processes those companies are using
to solve their DevOps problems, DevOps is a profession that finally seems to
be realizing their own value. In the first episode John Paul Ramirez takes the

<p>Introduction: Many organizations are facing the challenge of migrating their IT to the
cloud. But not many know how to actually approach this undertaking. In my
previous post I took a hands-on example of SpringSource's PetClinic reference
application with a Tomcat web server front-end and a Cassandra NoSQL database
backend and showed how to onboard it to the cloudin a manageable fashion. But
many think this methodology is only good for modern applications that were
built with some dynamic/cloud orientation in mind. For example, how different
would the cloud on-boarding process be if I modify my PetClinic example to use
a MySQL relational database instead of the modern Cassandra NoSQL clustered
database? In this blog post I intend to show that cloud on-boarding of
brownfield applications doesn't have to be a huge monolithic migration project
with high risk. Cloud on-boarding can take the pragmatic approach and can be
performed in a gradual process that both mitigates the risk and enables you to

<p>Introduction: Lustre速is a scalable, secure, robust, highly-available cluster file system. It
is designed, developed and maintained by Cluster File Systems, Inc.The central
goal is the development of a next-generation cluster file system which can
serve clusters with 10,000's of nodes, provide petabytes of storage, and move
100's of GB/sec with state-of-the-art security and management
infrastructure.Lustre runs on many of the largest Linux clusters in the world,
and is included by CFS's partners as a core component of their cluster
offering (examples include HP StorageWorks SFS, and the Cray XT3 and XD1
supercomputers). Today's users have also demonstrated that Lustre scales down
as well as it scales up, and runs in production on clusters as small as 4 and
as large as 25,000 nodes.The latest version of Lustre is always available from
Cluster File Systems, Inc. Public Open Source releases of Lustre are available
under the GNU General Public License. These releases are found here, and are

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.If datacenters are the
new castles, then what will be the new gunpowder? As soon asgunpowdercame on
the scene, castles, which are defensive structures, quickly became the
future's cold, drafty hotels. Gunpowder fueled cannon balls make short work of
castle walls.There's a long history of "gunpowder" type inventions in the tech
industry. PCs took out the timeshare model. The cloud is taking out the PC
model. There must be something that will take out the cloud.Right now it's
hard to believe the cloud will one day be no more. They seem so much the
future, but something will transcend the cloud. We even have a law that says
so:Bell's Law of Computer Classeswhich holds thatroughly every decade a new,
lower priced computer class forms based on a new programming platform,
network, and interface resulting in new usage and the establishment of a new
industry.Acomputer</p><p>5 0.15811846 <a title="1316-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Are_Cloud_Based_Memory_Architectures_the_Next_Big_Thing%3F.html">538 high scalability-2009-03-16-Are Cloud Based Memory Architectures the Next Big Thing?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-

<p>Introduction: Looks interesting...Abstract:Today's data centers may contain tens of
thousands of computers with significant aggregate bandwidth requirements. The
network architecture typically consists of a tree of routing and switching
elements with progressively more specialized and expensive equipment moving up
the network hierarchy. Unfortunately, even when deploying the highest-end IP
switches/routers, resulting topologies may only support 50% of the aggregate
bandwidth available at the edge of the network, while still incurring
tremendous cost. Nonuniform bandwidth among data center nodes complicates
application design and limits overall system performance.In this paper, we
show how to leverage largely commodity Ethernet switches to support the full
aggregate bandwidth of clusters consisting of tens of thousands of elements.
Similar to how clusters of commodity computers have largely replaced more
specialized SMPs and MPPs, we argue that appropriately architected and
interconnected commodity s</p><p>3 0.80901664 <a title="1316-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-30-Paper%3A_GargantuanComputing%E2%80%94GRIDs_and_P2P.html">374 high scalability-2008-08-30-Paper: GargantuanComputing—GRIDs and P2P</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I found the discussion of the available bandwidth of tree vs higher
dimensional virtual networks topologies quite, to quote Spock,fascinating:A
mathematical analysis by Ritter (2002) (one of the original developersof
Napster) presented a detailed numerical argument demonstrating that
theGnutella network could not scale to the capacity of its competitor,
theNapster network. Essentially, that model showed that the Gnutella network
isseverely bandwidth-limited long before the P2P population reaches a
millionpeers. In each of these previous studies, the conclusions have
overlooked theintrinsic bandwidth limits of the underlying topology in the
Gnutella network:a Cayley tree (Rains and Sloane 1999) (see Sect. 9.4 for the
definition).Trees are known to have lower aggregate bandwidth than higher
dimensionaltopologies, e.g., hypercubes and hypertori. Studies of
interconnectiontopologies in the literature have tended to focus on hardware
implementations(see, e.g., Culler et al. 1996; Buyya 1999</p><p>4 0.79088908 <a title="1316-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-22-Paper%3A_Revisiting_Network_I-O_APIs%3A_The_netmap_Framework.html">1213 high scalability-2012-03-22-Paper: Revisiting Network I-O APIs: The netmap Framework</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here's a really good article in the Communications of the ACM on reducing
network packet processing overhead by redesigning the network stack:
Revisiting Network I/O APIs: The Netmap Framework by Luigi Rizzo. As commodity
networking performance increases operating systems need to keep up or all
those CPUs will go to waste. How do they make this happen? Abstract:Today
10-gigabit interfaces are used more and more in datacenters and servers. On
these links, packets flow as fast as one every 67.2 nanoseconds, yet modern
operating systems can take 10-20 times longer just to move one packet between
the wire and the application. We can do much better, not with more powerful
hardware but by revising architectural decisions made long ago regarding the
design of device drivers and network stacks.The netmap framework is a
promising step in this direction. Thanks to a careful design and the
engineering of a new packet I/O API, netmap eliminates much unnecessary
overhead and moves traffic up to 40</p><p>5 0.78514779 <a title="1316-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-19-Is_it_time_to_get_rid_of_the_Linux_OS_model_in_the_cloud%3F.html">1177 high scalability-2012-01-19-Is it time to get rid of the Linux OS model in the cloud?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You program in a dynamic language, that runs on a JVM, that runs on a OS
designed40 years ago for a completely different purpose, that runs on
virtualized hardware. Does this make sense? We've talked about this idea
before inMachine VM + Cloud API - Rewriting The Cloud From Scratch, where the
vision is to treatcloud virtual hardware as a compiler target, and converting
high-level language source code directly into kernels that run on it.As new
technologies evolve the friction created by our old tool chains and
architecture models becomes ever more obvious. Take, for example, what
ateamatUCSD is releasing: aphase-change memory prototype  -a solid state
storage device that provides performance thousands of times faster than a
conventional hard drive and up to seven times faster than current state-of-
the-art solid-state drives (SSDs).However, PCM has access latencies several
times slower than DRAM.This technology has obvious mind blowing implications,
but an interesting not so obvious im</p><p>6 0.78468466 <a title="1316-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-04-OpenFlow-SDN_is_Not_a_Silver_Bullet_for_Network_Scalability.html">1256 high scalability-2012-06-04-OpenFlow-SDN is Not a Silver Bullet for Network Scalability</a></p>

together--has long been considered a faster, safer, and greener way of

Google'sdatacenter is the computerview of the world. In that view all compute
resources (memory, CPU, storage) are fungible. They are interchangeable and
location independent, individual computers lose identity and become just a
part of a service.Thwarting that nirvana has been the abysmal performance of
commodity datacenter networks which have caused the preference of
architectures that favor the collocation of state and behaviour on the same
box. MapReduce famouslyships code over to storage nodesfor just this
reason.Change the network and you change the fundamental assumption driving
collocation based software architectures. You are then free to store data
anywhere and move compute anywhere you wish. The datacenter becomes the

<p>Introduction: I try to keep this blog targeted and on topic. So even though I may be
thankful for thesongof the tinniestsparrowatsunrise, I'll save you from all
that. It's hard to tie scalability and thegiving of thankstogether, especially
as it sometimes occurs to me that this blog may be a self-indulgent waste of
time. But I think I found a sentiment in A New THEORY of AWESOMENESS and
MIRACLES byJames Bridlethat manages to marry the topic of this blog and giving
thanks meaningfully together:I distrust commercial definitions of innovation,
and particularly of awesomeness. It's an overused term. When I think of
awesomeness, I want something awe-inspiring, vast and mind-expanding.So I
started thinking about things that I think are awesome, or miraculous, and for
me, it kept coming back to scale and complexity.We're not actually very good
about thinking about scale and complexity in real terms, so we have to use
metaphors and examples. Douglas Adams writes somewhere about how big the

<p>Introduction: Deferred Deletesis a technique where deleted items are marked as deleted but
not garbage collected until some days or preferably weeks later. James
Hamilton talks describes this strategy in his classicOn Designing and
Deploying Internet-Scale Services:Never delete anything. Just mark it deleted.
When new data comes in, record the requests on the way. Keep a rolling two
week (or more) history of all changes to help recover from software or
administrative errors. If someone makes a mistake and forgets the where clause
on a delete statement (it has happened before and it will again), all logical
copies of the data are deleted. Neither RAID nor mirroring can protect against
this form of error. The ability to recover the data can make the difference
between a highly embarrassing issue or a minor, barely noticeable glitch. For
those systems already doing off-line backups, this additional record of data
coming into the service only needs to be since the last backup. But, being
cautious, we re</p><p>6 0.8767131 <a title="1316-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-27-Amazon_Announces_Static_IP_Addresses_and_Multiple_Datacenter_Operation.html">289 high scalability-2008-03-27-Amazon Announces Static IP Addresses and Multiple Datacenter Operation</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:   Social networks in the database: using a graph database . A nice post on representing, traversing, and performing other common social network operations using a graph database.  If you are  Digg  or  LinkedIn  you can build your own speedy graph database to represent your complex social network relationships. For those of more modest means  Neo4j , a graph database, is a good alternative.  A graph is a collection nodes (things) and edges (relationships) that connect pairs of nodes. Slap properties (key-value pairs) on nodes and relationships and you have a surprisingly powerful way to represent most anything you can think of. In a graph database "relationships are first-class citizens. They connect two nodes and both nodes and relationships can hold an arbitrary amount of key-value pairs. So you can look at a graph database as a key-value store, with full support for relationships."

<p>Introduction: On the surface nothing appears more different than soft data and hard raw materials like iron. Then isn’t it  ironic , in the  Alanis Morissette  sense,  that in this Age of Information, great wealth still lies hidden deep beneath piles of stuff?  It's so strange how directly digging for dollars in data parallels the great wealth producing models of the Industrial Revolution.
 
The piles of stuff is the Internet. It takes lots of prospecting to find the right stuff. Mighty web crawling machines tirelessly collect stuff, bringing it into their huge maws, then depositing load after load into rack after rack of distributed file system machines. Then armies of still other machines take this stuff and strip out the valuable raw materials, which in the Information Age, are endless bytes of raw data. Link clicks, likes, page views, content, head lines, searches, inbound links, outbound links, search clicks, hashtags, friends, purchases: anything and everything you do on the Internet is a valu</p><p>4 0.19188842 <a title="1285-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-10-Paper%3A_Graph_Databases_and_the_Future_of_Large-Scale_Knowledge_Management.html">626 high scalability-2009-06-10-Paper: Graph Databases and the Future of Large-Scale Knowledge Management</a></p>

<p>Introduction: At some point as a programmer you might have the insight/fear that all programming is just doing stuff to other stuff.
 
Then you may observe after coding the same stuff over again that stuff in a program often takes the form of interacting patterns of flows.
 
Then you may think hey, a program isn't only useful for coding datastructures, but a program is a kind of datastructure and that with a meta level jump you could program a program in terms of flows over data and flow over other flows.
 
That's the kind of stuff Prismatic is making available in the Graph extension to their  plumbing  package ( code examples ), which is described in an excellent post:  Graph: Abstractions for Structured Computation .

<p>Introduction: To continue the graph theme Google has got into the act and released information on  Pregel . Pregel does not appear to be a new type of potato chip. Pregel is instead a scalable infrastructure...
   ...to mine a wide range of graphs. In Pregel, programs are expressed as a sequence of iterations. In each iteration, a vertex can, independently of other vertices, receive messages sent to it in the previous iteration, send messages to other vertices, modify its own and its outgoing edges' states, and mutate the graph's topology.  Currently, Pregel scales to billions of vertices and edges, but this limit will keep expanding. Pregel's applicability is harder to quantify, but so far we haven't come across a type of graph or a practical graph computing problem which is not solvable with Pregel. It computes over large graphs much faster than alternatives, and the application programming interface is easy to use. Implementing PageRank, for example, takes only about 15 lines of code.

<p>Introduction: GraphChi  uses a  Parallel Sliding Windows  method which can: process a graph with mutable edge values efficiently from disk, with only a small number of non-sequential disk accesses, while supporting the asynchronous model of computation.
 
 
 
The result is graphs with billions of edges can be processed on just a single machine. It uses a vertex-centric computation model similar to  Pregel , which supports iterative algorithims as apposed to the batch style of MapReduce.  Streaming graph updates  are supported.
 
About GraphChi, Carlos Guestrin, codirector of Carnegie Mellon's Select Lab,  says :
  

A Mac Mini running GraphChi can analyze Twitter's social graph from 2010—which contains 40 million users and 1.2 billion connections—in 59 minutes. "The previous published result on this problem took 400 minutes using a cluster of about 1,000 computers

<p>Introduction: From  http://directory.fsf.org/project/collectd/  :   'collectd' is a small daemon which collects system information every 10 seconds and writes the results in an RRD-file. The statistics gathered include: CPU and memory usage, system load, network latency (ping), network interface traffic, and system temperatures (using lm-sensors), and disk usage. 'collectd' is not a script; it is written in C for performance and portability. It stays in the memory so there is no need to start up a heavy interpreter every time new values should be logged.     
 
From the collectd website:   Collectd gathers information about the system it is running on and stores this information. The information can then be used to do find current performance bottlenecks (i. e. performance analysis) and predict future system load (i. e. capacity planning). Or if you just want pretty graphs of your private server and are fed up with some homegrown solution you're at the right place, too ;).  While collectd can do a l</p><p>4 0.84530318 <a title="1285-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-01-Moving_Beyond_End-to-End_Path_Information_to_Optimize_CDN_Performance.html">712 high scalability-2009-10-01-Moving Beyond End-to-End Path Information to Optimize CDN Performance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You go through the expense of installing CDNs all over the globe to make sure users always have a node close by and you notice something curious and furious: clients still experience poor latencies. What's up with that? What do you do to find the problem?

If you are Google you build a tool (WhyHigh) to figure out what's up. This paper is about the tool and the unexpected problem of   high latencies   on CDNs. The main problems they found: inefficient routing to nearby nodes and packet queuing. But more useful is the architecture of WhyHigh and how it goes about identifying bottle necks. And even more useful is the general belief in creating sophisticated tools to understand and improve your service. That's what professionals do.

From the abstract:
   
Replicating content across a geographically distributed set of servers and redirecting clients to the closest server in terms of latency has emerged as a common paradigm for improving client performance.

<p>Introduction: My apologies if you were looking for a post about cell phones. This post is about high density nanodevices. It's a follow up to  How will memristors change everything?  for those wishing to pursue these revolutionary ideas in more depth. This is one of those areas where if you are in the space then there's a lot of available information and if you are on the outside then it doesn't even seem to exist. Fortunately, Ben Chandler from  The SyNAPSE Project , was kind enough to point me to a great set of presentations given at the  12th IEEE CNNA - International Workshop on Cellular Nanoscale Networks and their Applications  - Towards Megaprocessor Computing. WARNING: these papers contain extreme technical content. If you are like me and you aren't an electrical engineer, much of it may make a sort of surface sense, but the deep and twisty details will fly over head. For the more software minded there are a couple more accessible presentations:

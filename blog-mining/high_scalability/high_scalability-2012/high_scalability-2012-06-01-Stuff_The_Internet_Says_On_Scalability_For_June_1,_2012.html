<p>Introduction: Update 8 :  The Cost of Latency  by James Hamilton. James summarizing some latency info from      Steve Souder ,   Greg Linden , and   Marissa Mayer .      Speed [is] an undervalued and under-discussed asset on the web. 
 
 Update 7:   How do you know when you need more memcache servers? . Dathan Pattishall talks about using memcache not to scale, but to reduce latency and reduce I/O spikes, and how to use stats to know when more servers are needed.  Update 6:   Stock Traders Find Speed Pays, in Milliseconds . Goldman Sachs is making record profits off a  500 millisecond  trading advantage. Yes, latency matters. As an interesting aside, Libet found 500 msecs is about the time it takes the brain to weave together an experience of consciousness from all our sensor inputs.  Update 5:   Shopzilla's Site Redo - You Get What You Measure .

<p>Introduction: Update 4:   Heroku versus GAE & GAE/J 
 
   Update 3 :   Heroku has gone live! . Congratulations to the team. It's difficult right now to get a feeling for the relative cost and reliability of Heroku, but it's an impressive accomplishment and a viable option for people looking for a delivery platform.
 
 Update 2 :  Heroku Architecture . A great interactive presentation of the Heroku stack. Requests flow into Nginx used as a HTTP Reverse Proxy. Nginx routes requests into a Varnish based HTTP cache. Then requests are injected into an Erlang based routing mesh that balances requests across a grid of dynos. Dynos are your application "VMs" that implement application specific behaviors.  Dynos themselves are a stack of: POSIX, Ruby VM, App Server, Rack, Middleware, Framework, Your App. Applications can access PostgreSQL. Memcached is used as an application caching layer.
 
 Update : Aaron Worsham   Interview with James Lindenbaum, CEO of Heroku .

 Quotable Quotes:                           
 
  Jony Ive : I feel that ideas are very fragile, so you have to be tender when they are in development. I realized that if he pissed on this, it would be so sad because I know it was so important. 
  @BenedictEvans : 100m users is the new 1m users. $4bn is the new $400m. 30 staff is the new 300 staff. 
  @postwait : Knowing the latency of every I/O on every spindle in every machine in every rack... over all of time. Done & eye-opening. Thanks @circonus. 
  @mrb_bk : Things that hurt: unbounded memory growth. Things that help: concurrency control.

<p>Introduction: Submitted for your scaling pleasure: 
  
 Good idea:  Open The Index And Speed Up The Internet .  SmugMug estimates 50%  of their CPU is spent serving crawler robots. Having a common meta-data repository wouldn't prevent search engines from having their own special sauce. Then the problem becomes one of syncing data between repositories and processing change events. A generous soul could even offer a shared MapReduce service over the data. Now that would  speed up the internet . 
 Scaling Achievements:  YouTube Sees 3 Billion Views per Day ;  Twitter produces a sustained feed of 35 Mb per second ;  companies processing billions of APIs calls  (Twitter, Netflix, Amazon, NPR, Google, Facebook, eBay, Bing);  Astronomers Identify the Farthest Object Ever Observed, 13.14 Billion Light Years Away

<p>Introduction: Hey, it's HighScalability time:
    ( Giant Hurricane on Saturn , here's one  in New Orleans )  
 
  
  1,966,080 cores : Time Warp synchronization protocol using up to 7.8M MPI tasks on 1,966,080 cores of the {Sequoia} Blue Gene/Q supercomputer system. 33 trillion events processed in 65 seconds yielding a peak event-rate in excess of 504 billion events/second using 120 racks of Sequoia. 
 Quotable Quotes:                             
 
  Thad Starner : the longer accessing a device exceeds 2s, the more its actually usage would decrease exponentially. Thus, he made a claim that wrist watch interface always sitting on one's wrist ready to use should be more successful than mobile phones which have to pulled out of the pocket.  
  @joedevon : We came for scalability but we stayed for agility #NoSQL 
  @jahmailay : "Our user base is exploding. I really wish we spent more time on scalability instead of features customers don't use." - Everybody, always.

  Geoff Arnold : Arguably all interesting advances in computer science and software engineering occur when a resource that was previously scarce or expensive becomes cheap and plentiful.

  @rodos : With so much manure in the room of #BigData the must be a pony in here somewhere! 
  @adron : #ricon2012 OH "it isn't cloud, nosql or whatever, it's distributed systems... That is the change!" Smartest thing stated at a conf in ages. 
  @justinesherry : First lesson watching @eric_brewer's keynote at #ricon2012 -- distributed systems make you go bald. (Both audience and speaker!)  
  @adron : OH "What's the hello world of distributed systems?" "Twitter." 
  Mikael Ronstrom : A long career on distributed systems has learnt me that it is extremely important to do proper partitioning of data sets to achieve scalability on network level. But it is still extremely important to make each node in the distributed system as large as possible.

<p>Introduction: What will the version of the Internet that follows us to the stars look like? Yes, people are really thinking seriously about this sort of thing. Specifically the  InterPlanetary Networking Special Interest Group  (IPNSIG).
 
 
 
 Ansible-like  faster-than-light communication it isn't. There's no magical warp drive. Nor is a network of telepaths acting as a 'verse spanning telegraph system.
 
It's more mundane than that. And in many ways more interesting as it's sort of like the old Internet on steroids, the one that was based on on UUCP and dial-up connections, but over vastly longer distances and with much  longer delays :
  

The Interplanetary Internet (based on IPN, also called InterPlaNet) is a conceived computer network in space, consisting of a set of network nodes which can communicate with each other.[1][2] Communication would be greatly delayed by the great interplanetary distances, so the IPN needs a new set of protocols and technology that are tolerant to large delays and</p><p>2 0.93076468 <a title="1255-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-10-Sharding_with_Cookie-Based_Session_Storage.html">207 high scalability-2008-01-10-Sharding with Cookie-Based Session Storage</a></p>

 The death of the general purpose computer is causing strange events like Facebook making their  own smart phone .

<p>Introduction: How do you design a reliable distributed file system when the expected availability of the individual nodes are only ~1/5? That is the case for P2P systems. Dominik Grolimund, the founder of a Swiss startup Caleido will show you how! They have   launched Wuala  , the social online storage service which scales as new nodes join the P2P network.     The goal of   Wua.la   is to provide distributed online storage that is:     large   scalable   reliable   secure     by harnessing the idle resources of participating computers.     This challenge is an old dream of computer science. In fact as   Andrew Tanenbaum   wrote in 1995:    "The design of a world-wide, fully transparent distributed filesystem fot simultaneous use by millions of mobile and frequently disconnected users is left as an exercise for the reader"      After three years of research and development at at ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology on a distributed storage system, Caleido is ready to unveil the resu</p><p>6 0.88935786 <a title="1255-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-26-MySQL_and_Memcached%3A_End_of_an_Era%3F.html">785 high scalability-2010-02-26-MySQL and Memcached: End of an Era?</a></p>

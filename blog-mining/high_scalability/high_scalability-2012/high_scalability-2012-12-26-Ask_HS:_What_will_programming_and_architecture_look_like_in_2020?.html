<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear? For years startups, like the frenetically inventive age of the 17th</p><p>5 0.10089065 <a title="1377-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-09-Applications_as_Virtual_States.html">790 high scalability-2010-03-09-Applications as Virtual States</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Wired has awonderful interview with Clayton Christensen, author of the tech
ninja's bible, Innovator's Dilemma. Innovation is the name of the game in
Silicon Valley and if you want to understand the rules of the game this
article is a quick and clear way of learning. Everything is simply explained
with compelling examples by the man himself.Just as every empire has fallen,
every organization is open to disruption. It's the human condition to become
comfortable and discount potential dangers. It takes a great deal of
mindfulness to outwit and outlast the human condition. If you want to be the
disruptor and avoid being the disruptee, this is good stuff.He also talks
about his new book,The Capitalist's Dilemma, which addresses this puzzle: if
corporations are doing so well why are individuals doing so bad?If someone can
help you see a deep meaningful pattern in life then they haven't brought you a
fish, they've taught you how to fish. That's what Christensen does. Here's a

<p>Introduction: Over the years I've read a lot of research papers looking for better ways of
doing things. Sometimes I find ideas I can use, but more often than not I come
up empty. The problem is there are very few good papers. And by good I mean:
can a reasonably intelligent person read a paper and turn it into something
useful? Now, clearly I'm not an academic and clearly I'm no genius, I'm just
an everyday programmer searching for leverage, and as a common specimen of the
species I've often thought how much better our industry would be if we could
simply move research from academia into production with some sort of self-
conscious professionalism. Currently the process is horribly hit or miss. And
this problem extends equally to companies with research divisions that often
do very little to help front-line developers succeed. How many ideas break out
of academia into industry in computer science? We have many brilliant
examples: encryption, microprocessors, compression, transactions, distributed

DUGDALE.The concept of road trains--up to eight vehicles zooming down the road
together--has long been considered a faster, safer, and greener way of
traveling long distances by carUpdate 16:The first electric vehicle in the
countrypowered completely by ultracapacitors. The minibus can be fully
recharged in fifteen minutes, unlike battery vehicles, which typically takes
hours to recharge.Update 15:How to Make UAVs Fully Autonomous. The Sense-and-
Avoid system uses a four-megapixel camera on a pan tilt to detect obstacles
from the ground. It puts red boxes around planes and birds, and blue boxes
around movement that it determines is not an obstacle (e.g., dust on the
lens).Update 14:ATNMBL is a concept vehiclefor 2040 that represents the end of

Theorem: A Proposed Theorem for the Trade-offs in Horizontally Scalable Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Successful software design is all about trade-offs. In the typical (if there
is such a thing) distributed system, recognizing the importance of trade-offs
within the design of your architecture is integral to the success of your
system. Despite this reality, I see time and time again, developers choosing a
particular solution based on an ill-placed belief in their solution as a
“silver bullet”, or a solution that conquers all, despite the inevitable
occurrence of changing requirements. Regardless of the reasons behind this
phenomenon, I’d like to outline a few of the methods I use to ensure that I’m
making good scalable decisions without losing sight of the trade-offs that
accompany them. I’d also like to compile (pun intended) the issues at hand, by
formulating a simple theorem that we can use to describe this oft occurring
situation.</p><p>3 0.88578802 <a title="1377-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-21-Hot_Holiday_Scalability_Links_for_2009.html">753 high scalability-2009-12-21-Hot Holiday Scalability Links for 2009</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In It's Time for Low Latency  Stephen Rumble et al. explore the idea that it's
time to rearchitect our stack to live in the modern era of low-latency
datacenter instead of high-latency WANs. The implications for
programarchitectures will be revolutionary.  Luiz Andre Barroso, Distinguished
Engineer at Google, sees ultra low latency as a way to make computer
resources, to be as much as possible, fungible, that is they are
interchangeable and location independent, effectively turning a datacenter
into single computer. Abstract from the paper:The operating systems community
has ignored network latency for too long. In the past, speed-of-light delays
in wide area networks and unoptimized network hardware have made sub-100µs
round-trip times impossible. However, in the next few years datacenters will
be deployed with low-latency Ethernet. Without the burden of propagation
delays in the datacenter campus and network delays in the Ethernet devices, it
will be up to us to ﬁnish the job and see</p><p>6 0.87482804 <a title="1377-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-13-AIDA%3A_Badoo%E2%80%99s_journey_into_Continuous_Integration.html">1531 high scalability-2013-10-13-AIDA: Badoo’s journey into Continuous Integration</a></p>

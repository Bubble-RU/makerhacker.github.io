<p>Introduction: Think of building websites as engineeringcomposite materials. A composite
material is when two or more materials are combined to create a third material
that does something useful that the components couldn't do on their own.
Composites like reinforced concrete have revolutionized design and
construction. When building websites we usually bring different component
materials together, like creating a composite, to get the features we need
rather than building a completely new thing from scratch that does everything
we want.This approach has been seen as a hack because it leads to inelegancies
like data duplication; great gobs of component glue; consistency issues; and
messy operations. But what if the the composite approach is really a strength,
not a hack, but a messy part of the world that needs to be embraced rather
than belittled?They key is tosee data as a material. Right now we are arguing
which is the best single material to build with. Is itNoSQL, relational,
massively parallel,</p><p>5 0.10982395 <a title="1315-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-07-Startups_are_Creating_a_New_System_of_the_World_for_IT.html">1240 high scalability-2012-05-07-Startups are Creating a New System of the World for IT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: Jumping around the social mediasphere, it's not uncommon to feel the heat
generated in praise of a favorite this or that over all the clearly inferior
alternatives. Whilst human nature may never cool, I think Old Will had some
insight worth considering the next time a flame threatens to flicker forth:My
mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun (Sonnet 130)My mistress' eyes are
nothing like the sun;Coral is far more red than her lips' red ;If snow be
white, why then her breasts are dun;If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her
head.I have seen roses damask, red and white,But no such roses see I in her
cheeks;And in some perfumes is there more delightThan in the breath that from
my mistress reeks.I love to hear her speak, yet well I knowThat music hath a
far more pleasing sound;I grant I never saw a goddess go;My mistress, when she
walks, treads on the ground:And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rareAs any
she belied with false compare.-William Shakespeare</p><p>same-blog 2 0.88044071 <a title="1315-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-30-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_31%2C_2012.html">1315 high scalability-2012-08-30-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 31, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hey guys,There is a renewed push at my organization to deploy
vmware...everywhere.I am rather excited as I know we have a lot of waste when
it comes to resources.What has pricked my ears up however, is the notion of
using this technology in our very busy public facing DMZ's.Today we get lots
of spikes of traffic and we are coping very well. 40x HP blades,
apache/php/perl/tomcat/ all in HA behind HA F5's and HA Checkpoint FW's. (20
servers in 2 datacentres).The idea is, we virtualise these machines, including
the firewalls onto hosts vmware clusters that span the public interface to our
internal networks. This is something that has gone against the #1 rule I have
ever lived by while working on the inet. No airgaps from the unknown to the
known!I am interested in feedback on this scenario.From a resource
perspective, our resource requirements in the DMZ will be lowered over time
due to business change and we still have a lot of head room in our capacity.Do
you think this is change for ch</p><p>4 0.81514096 <a title="1315-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-24-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_24%2C_2011.html">1067 high scalability-2011-06-24-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 24, 2011</a></p>

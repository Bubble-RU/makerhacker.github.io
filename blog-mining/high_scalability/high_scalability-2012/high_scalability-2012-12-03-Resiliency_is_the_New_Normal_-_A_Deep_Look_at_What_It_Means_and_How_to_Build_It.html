common system. It was simply too complex and too expensive.An evolution has
been underway, making 2013 possibly the first time resiliency is truly on the

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: Over the years I've read a lot of research papers looking for better ways of
doing things. Sometimes I find ideas I can use, but more often than not I come
up empty. The problem is there are very few good papers. And by good I mean:
can a reasonably intelligent person read a paper and turn it into something
useful? Now, clearly I'm not an academic and clearly I'm no genius, I'm just
an everyday programmer searching for leverage, and as a common specimen of the
species I've often thought how much better our industry would be if we could
simply move research from academia into production with some sort of self-
conscious professionalism. Currently the process is horribly hit or miss. And
this problem extends equally to companies with research divisions that often
do very little to help front-line developers succeed. How many ideas break out
of academia into industry in computer science? We have many brilliant
examples: encryption, microprocessors, compression, transactions, distributed

<p>Introduction: With the Chapultepec aqueduct, also namedthe great aqueduct, theAztecsbuilt a
novel uninterruptible water supply for providing fresh water to Tenochtitlan,
their fast growing jewel of a capital city. A section of the aqueduct is still
around today: It's fun to think about how even 600 years ago how it was built
with high availability in mind. We findengineers being engineers, no matter
the age:It consisted of a twin pipe distribution system made in part of
compacted soil and in part of wood for the crossings of the aqueduct over the
bridges built to allow the passage of the canoes. It was finished around 1466
AD, and the main purpose was to supply fresh water to Mexico-Tenochtitlan, to
mitigate its thirst.The main source for the aqueduct was the spring of
Chapultepec and the purpose of the twin pipes was to ease the maintenance of
the system, because the water was conveyed through one pipe, and when it got
dirty, the water was diverted to the other pipe while the dirty pipe was
cleaned</p><p>6 0.82635838 <a title="1366-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-19-What_can_the_Amazing_Race_to_the_South_Pole_Teach_us_About_Startups%3F.html">1503 high scalability-2013-08-19-What can the Amazing Race to the South Pole Teach us About Startups?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Perhaps it is because the whole world feels as if it's riding on the edge of a
jagged knife that the idea ofresilienceis becoming a dominant theme across so
many domains. Resilience in beings first developed when cells evolved a way
ofmaintaining inner orderthrough homeostatic (stability through constancy)
mechanisms. After homeostasis was mastered,allostasis(stability through
change) developed as a way of responding to a dynamic world of challenge. In
economics we have the idea ofTransition Towns, which emphasizes developing
local economies as a way of being resilient to global failures. In agriculture
we have the idea ofpermaculture, building a permanent agriculture by embracing
diversity, sustainability, perennial systems, avoiding monocultures, and
usingedge thinking. There are many more examples, includingpsychological
resilienceand the legendaryresilience of ecosystems.To explore the idea of
resiliency we'll look at a few sources:Collapse Dynamics: Phase Transitions in

<p>Introduction: How do you keep a system small enough, while still being successful, that a
simple scale-up strategy becomes the preferred architecture?StackOverflow, for
example, could stick with a tool chain they were comfortable with because they
had a natural brake on how fast they could grow: there are only so many
programmers in the world. If this doesn't work for you, here's another natural
braking strategy to consider:charge for your service.Paul Houlesummarized this
nicely as:avoid scaling problems by building a service that's profitable at a
small scale.This interesting point, one I hadn't properly considered before,
was brought up by Maciej Ceglowski, co-founder ofPinboard.in, in an interview
with Leo Laporte and Amber MacArthur on their theirnet@nightshow.Pinboard is a
lean, mean, pay for bookmarking machine, a timely replacement for the nearly
departed Delicious. And as a self professed anti-social bookmarking site, it
emphasizes speed over socializing.

<p>Introduction: Judging from the tweet flow, Velocitylooked like a riotous good time. In this
video on themain themes at Velocity, after a little microphone enhanced
violence, John Allspaw and Steve Souders identifyresilienceandautomationas two
of the big ideas behind building a faster and stronger web.John says
resiliency is the idea that we we don't live in a perfect world so trying to
build perfect systems is counter productive. We have to accept failure as a
baseline and think in terms of degrees of availability. All abstraction layers
leak so every part of a system must be monitorable and open to introspection.A
focus on resilience means the web is growing up. Resilience has long been a
requirement for "real" systems, it's great to see the web thinking in terms of
the complex systems they've always been. For the Alpha and Omega on resilience
you'll want to watchDr. Richard Cook'sinspiring talk on How Complex Systems
Fail. Here are some of the most enjoyable Quotable Quotes from

This totally requires a scale-up strategy.Facebook at60,000 serversand
counting.Deepak Singh has collected some impressivemassive datastats on
extreme Hadoop usage: Facebook: 36 PB of uncompressed data, 2250 machines,
23,000 cores, 32 GB of RAM per machine, processing 80-90TB/day; Yahoo: 70 PB
of data in HDFS, 170 PB spread across the globe, 34000 servers, Processing 3
PB per day, 120 TB flow through Hadoop every day;Twitter: 7 TB/day into HDFS;
LinkedIn: 120 Billion relationships; 82 Hadoop jobs daily (IIRC); 16 TB of
intermedia data.Who knew DevOps could be so funny? Adam Jacob, CTO of Opscode,
gave ahilarious talkat the Velocity conference on the true nature of DevOps.

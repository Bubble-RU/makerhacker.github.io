<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ali Khajeh-Hosseini, Technical Lead at
PlanForCloud.com.  I read a recent blog post about TripAdvisor's experiment
with AWS where they attempted to process 700K HTTP requests per minute on a
replica of their live site. There was also an interesting blog post on
Pinterest's massive growth on AWS. These blogs highlighted exactly the types
of questions we're interested in, mainly:How much would it cost to deploy
System X on Cloud Y? e.g. how much would it cost to host TripAdvisor on the
AWS US-East cloud?Would it be cheaper to use deployment option X or Y? e.g.
would it be cheaper to use reserved instances, different types of instances,
different cloud providers...What happens to costs when the system grows? e.g.
Pinterest has around 410TB of data on S3, what if that keeps growing at a rate
of 25% every month, like it has been in the last 10 months?I created a couple
of deployments in PlanForCloud to explore these questions and the results are
very interesting - th</p><p>3 0.2954784 <a title="1248-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-12-Pinterest_Cut_Costs_from_%2454_to_%2420_Per_Hour_by_Automatically_Shutting_Down_Systems.html">1371 high scalability-2012-12-12-Pinterest Cut Costs from $54 to $20 Per Hour by Automatically Shutting Down Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We've long known one of the virtues of the cloud is, through the magic of
services and automation, that systems can be shut or tuned down when not in
use. What may be surprising is how much money can be saved. This aspect of
cloudiness got a lot of pub atAWS re:Invent and is being rebranded under the
term Cost-Aware Architecture. Aninteresting examplewas given by Ryan Park,
Pinterest's technical operations lead:20% of their systems are shutdown after
hours in response to traffic loadsReserved instances are used for standard
traffic On-demand and spot instances are used to handle the elastic load
throughout the day. When more servers are needed for an auto-scaled service,
spot requests are opened and on-demand instances are started at the same time.
Most services are targeted to run at about 50% on-demand and 50% spot.Watchdog
processes continually check what's running. More instances are launched when
needed and terminated when not needed. If spot prices spike and spot instances

<p>Introduction: I love it when a somewhat older article like Pinterest Cut Costs From $54 To
$20 Per Hour By Automatically Shutting Down Systems hits Hacker News and
generates agood conversation. One of the common sentiments about the cloud was
raised: why doesn't Pinterest save a lot of money by running their own
hardware instead of using the cloud?Ryan Park, Operations Engineer at
Pinterest, responds in what I think is the perfectmodern responseto that
ultimate existential design dilemma:Our #1 requirement has been to keep up
with the growth in traffic on the site. We've been growing so fast that
there's literally no way we could have ordered and racked equipment fast
enough. We were also a very small team -- a year ago there were only about a
dozen people in the whole company. At this point we're much larger, which
gives us room to consider more options like colo or multiple cloud
providers.AWS certainly feels pretty costly when you compare colo prices to
the list price for on-demand instances.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byAli Khajeh-Hosseini, Technical Lead atPlanForCloud. The
original article was publishedon their site. With 29 cloud price reductions I
thought it would be interesting to see how the bottom line would change
compared to an articlewe published last year. The result is surprisingly
little for TripAdvisor because prices for On Demand instances havenot dropped
as fastas for other other instances types.Over the last year and a half,we
counted 29 price reductionsin cloud services provided by AWS, Google Compute
Engine, Windows Azure, and Rackspace Cloud. Price reductions have a direct
effect on cloud users, but given the usual tiny reductions, how significant is
that effect on the bottom line?Last year I wrote aboutcloud cost forecasts for
TripAdvisor and Pinterest.TripAdvisor was experimenting with AWSand attempted
to process 700K HTTP requests per minute on a replica of its live site,

<p>Introduction: Vaibhav PuranikinWeb serving in the cloud - our experiences with nginx and
instance sizesdescribes their experience trying to maximum traffic and minimum
their web serving costs on EC2. Initially they tested with two m1.small
instance types and then they the switched to two c1.mediums instance types.
The m1s are the standard instance types and the c1s are the high CPU instance
types. Obviously the mediums have greater capability, but the cost difference
was interesting:In the long term they will save money using the larger
instances and not autoscaling. With the small instances, traffic bursts caused
autoscaling to kick in. New instances were started in response to load. The
instances woud be up for a short period of time and then spin down again. This
constant churn costs a lot of money. Selecting the larger instance sizes,
which are capable of handling the load without autoscaling, turn out to save
money even though they are more expensive. Starting new instances also takes a

<p>Introduction: There has been an update on Pinterest: Pinterest growth driven by Amazon cloud
scalability since our last post: A Short on the Pinterest Stack for Handling
3+ Million Users.With Pinterest we see a story very similar to that
ofInstagram. Huge growth, lots of users, lots of data, with remarkably few
employees, all on the cloud.While it's true that both Pinterest and Instagram
are not making great advances inscience and technology, that is more indicator
of the easy power of today's commodity environments rather than a sign of
Silicon Valley's lack of innovation. The numbers are so huge and the
valuations are so high we naturally want some sort of fundamental
technological revolution to underlie their growth. The revolution is more
subtle. It really is just that easy to attain such growth these days, if you
can execute on the right idea. Get used to it. This is the new normal.Here's
what Pinterest looks like today: 80 million objects stored in S3 with 410
terabytes of user data, 10x what</p><p>2 0.87961507 <a title="1248-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-05-Strategy%3A_Diagonal_Scaling_-_Don%27t_Forget_to_Scale_Out_AND_Up.html">142 high scalability-2007-11-05-Strategy: Diagonal Scaling - Don't Forget to Scale Out AND Up</a></p>
<p>Introduction: All the cool kids advocate scaling out as the secret sauce of scaling. And it
is, but don't forget to serve some tasty "scaling up" as a side dish. Scaling
up doesn't have to mean buying a jet propelled, liquid cooled, 128 core
monster super computer. Scaling up can just mean buying at the high end of the
commodity buffet by buying more cores, more memory and using a shared nothing
architecture to take advantage of all that power without adding complexity.
Scale out when you need to, but big beefy boxes can absorb a lot of load
before it's necessary to hit up your data center for more rack space. Here are
a few examples of scaling out and up:breakJohn Allspaw, Flickr's operations
manager, coined the termdiagonal scalingfor this strategy. InMaking a site
faster by removing machines(and a comment on this post) John told how Flickr
replaced 67 dual-cpu boxes with 18 dual quad-core machines and recovered
almost 4x rack space and reduced costs by about 50 percent.Fotolog's

<p>Introduction: One of the most important architectural decisions that must be done early on
in a scalable web site project issplitting the data flow into two streams: one
that is user specific and one that is generic. If this is done properly, the
system will be able to grow easily. On the other hand, if the data streams are
not separated from the start, then the growth options will be severely
limited. Trying to make such a web site scale will be just painting the
corpse, and this change will cost a whole lot more when you need to introduce
it later (and it is "when" in this case, not "if").</p><p>4 0.83473021 <a title="1248-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-23-Evernote_Architecture_-_9_Million_Users_and_150_Million_Requests_a_Day.html">1046 high scalability-2011-05-23-Evernote Architecture - 9 Million Users and 150 Million Requests a Day</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The folks atEvernote were kind enough to write up an overview of their
architecture in a post titled Architectural Digest. Dave Engberg describes
their approach to networking, sharding, user storage, search, and some other
custom services.Evernote is a cool application, partially realizingVannevar
Bush's amazing visionof a memex. Wikipedia describes Evernote's features
succinctly: Evernote is a suite of software and services designed for
notetaking and archiving. A "note" can be a piece of formattable text, a full
webpage or webpage excerpt, a photograph, a voice memo, or a handwritten "ink"
note. Notes can also have file attachments. Notes can then be sorted into
folders, tagged, annotated, edited, given comments, and searched. Evernote
supports a number of operating system platforms (including Android, Mac OS X,
iOS, Microsoft Windows and WebOS), and also offers online synchronization and
backup services.Key here is that Evernote stores a lot of data, that must be
searched, and synce</p><p>5 0.83250266 <a title="1248-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-22-Kevin%27s_Great_Adventures_in_SSDland.html">257 high scalability-2008-02-22-Kevin's Great Adventures in SSDland</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:Final Thoughts on SSD and MySQL AKA Battleship Spinn3r. Tips on how to
make your database 10x faster using solid state drives. Potential exists for
100x speedup.Solid-state drives(SSDs) are the holy grail of storage. The
promise of RAM speeds and hard disk like persistence have for years driven us
crazy with power user lust, but they've stayed tantalizingly just out of
reach. Always too expensive, too small, and oddly too slow. Has that changed?
Can you now miraculously have your cake and eat it too? Can you now have it
both ways? Is balancing work with family life now as easy as tripping over a
terabyte drive?In a pioneering series of blog articles Kevin Burton conducts
original research on next generation SSD drives in real world configurations.

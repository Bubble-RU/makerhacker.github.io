<p>Introduction: InfoQueue has thisexcellent talk by Brian Goetzon the new features being added
to Java SE 7 that will allow programmers to fully exploit our massively multi-
processor future. While the talk is about Java it's really more general than
that and there's a lot to learn here for everyone.Brian starts with a short,
coherent, and compelling explanation of why programmers can't expect to be
saved by ever faster CPUs and why we must learn to exploit the strengths of
multiple core computers to make our software go faster.Some techniques for
exploiting multiple cores are given in an equally short, coherent, and
compelling explanation of why divide and conquer as the secret to multi-core
bliss, fork-join, how the Java approach differs from map-reduce, and lots of
other juicy topics.The multi-core "problem" is only going to get worse. Tilera
founder Anant Agarwalestimates by 2017embedded processors could have 4,096
cores, server CPUs might have 512 cores and desktop chips could use 128 cores.

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's

<p>Introduction: This article is a lightly edited version of 20 Obstacles to Scalability bySean
Hull (with permission) from the always excellent and thought provoking ACM
Queue.1. TWO-PHASE COMMITNormally when data is changed in a database, it is
written both to memory and to disk. When a commit happens, a relational
database makes a commitment to freeze the data somewhere on real storage
media. Remember, memory doesn't survive a crash or reboot. Even if the data is
cached in memory, the database still has to write it to disk. MySQL binary
logs or Oracle redo logs fit the bill.With a MySQL cluster or distributed file
system such as DRBD (Distributed Replicated Block Device) or Amazon Multi-AZ
(Multi-Availability Zone), a commit occurs not only locally, but also at the
remote end. A two-phase commit means waiting for an acknowledgment from the
far end. Because of network and other latency, those commits can be slowed
down by milliseconds, as though all the cars on a highway were slowed down by
heavy loa</p><p>5 0.15543024 <a title="1276-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-05-Little%E2%80%99s_Law%2C_Scalability_and_Fault_Tolerance%3A_The_OS_is_your_bottleneck._What_you_can_do%3F.html">1591 high scalability-2014-02-05-Little’s Law, Scalability and Fault Tolerance: The OS is your bottleneck.

<p>Introduction: This is a guestrepostby Ron Pressler, the founder and CEO ofParallel Universe,
a Y Combinator company building advanced middleware for real-time
applications. Little's Law helps us determine the maximum request rate a
server can handle. When we apply it, we find that the dominating factor
limiting a server's capacity is not the hardware but theOS.Should we buy more
hardware if software is the problem? If not, how can we remove that software
limitation in a way that does not make the code much harder to write and
understand?Many modern web applications are composed of multiple (often
many)HTTPservices (this is often called a micro-service architecture). This
architecture has many advantages in terms of code reuse and maintainability,
scalability and fault tolerance. In this post I'd like to examine one
particular bottleneck in the approach, which hinders scalability as well as
fault tolerance, and various ways to deal with it (I am using the term
"scalability" very loosely in this post</p><p>6 0.14967911 <a title="1276-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-16-Scaling_an_AWS_infrastructure_-_Tools_and_Patterns.html">881 high scalability-2010-08-16-Scaling an AWS infrastructure - Tools and Patterns</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Mark Travis, Founder ofInfiniSQL.InfiniSQL is the
specific "Infinitely Scalable RDBMS" to which the title refers. It is free
software, and instructions for getting, building, running and testing it are
available in theguide.Benchmarkingshows that an InfiniSQL cluster can handle
over 500,000 complex transactions per second with over 100,000 simultaneous
connections, all on twelve small servers. The methods used to test are
documented, and the code is all available so that any practitioner can achieve
similar results. There are two main characteristics which make InfiniSQL
extraordinary:It performs transactions with records on multiple nodes better
than any clustered/distributed RDBMSIt is free, open source. Not just a teaser

InfiniSQL will also be the enterprise version, when it is ready.InfiniSQL is

<p>Introduction: This a guest post byRajkumar Iyer, a Member of Technical Staff at
Aerospike.About a year ago, Aerospike embarked upon a quest to increase in-
memory database performance - 1 Million TPS on a single inexpensive commodity
server. NoSQL has the reputation of speed, and we saw great benefit from
improving latency and throughput of cacheless architectures. At that time, we
took a version of Aerospike delivering about 200K TPS, improved a few things -
performance went to 500k TPS - and published the Aerospike 2.0 Community
Edition. We then used kernel tuning techniques and published therecipefor how
we achieved 1 M TPS on $5k of hardware.This year we continued the quest. Our
goal was to achieve 1 Million database transactions per second per server;
more than doubling previous performance. This compares to Cassandra's boast of
1M TPS on over 300 servers in Google Compute Engine - at a cost of $2 million
dollars per year. Weachieved thiswithout kernel tuning. This article describes

<p>Introduction: If you stayed up all night watching the life reaffirmingCuriosity landing on
Mars, then this paper,High-Performance Concurrency Control Mechanisms for
Main-Memory Databases, has nothing to do with that at all, but it is an
excellent look at how to use optimistic MVCC schemes to reduce lock overhead
on in-memory datastructures:A database system optimized for in-memory storage
can support much higher transaction rates than current systems. However,
standard concurrency control methods used today do not scale to the high
transaction rates achievable by such systems. In this paper we introduce two
efficient concurrency control methods specifically designed for main-memory
databases. Both use multiversioning to isolate read-only transactions from
updates but differ in how atomicity is ensured: one is optimistic and one is
pessimistic. To avoid expensive context switching, transactions never block
during normal processing but they may have to wait before commit to ensure
correct serializatio</p><p>5 0.77747512 <a title="1276-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-05-Lessons_Learned_at_208K%3A_Towards_Debugging_Millions_of_Cores.html">484 high scalability-2009-01-05-Lessons Learned at 208K: Towards Debugging Millions of Cores</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do we debug and profile a cloud full of processors and threads? It's a
problem more will be seeing as we code big scary programs that run on even
bigger scarier clouds. Logging gets you far, but sometimes finding the root
cause of problem requires delving deep into a program's execution. I don't
know about you, but setting up 200,000+ gdb instances doesn't sound all that
appealing. Tools like STAT (Stack Trace Analysis Tool) are being developed to
help with this huge task. STAT "gathers and merges stack traces from a
parallel application's processes." So STAT isn't a low level debugger, but it
will help you find the needle in a million haystacks.Abstract:Petascale
systems will present several new challenges to performance and correctness
tools. Such machines may contain millions of cores, requiring that tools use
scalable data structures and analysis algorithms to collect and to process
application data. In addition, at such scales, each tool itself will become a
large parallel app</p><p>6 0.76637191 <a title="1276-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-23-Learn_How_to_Exploit_Multiple_Cores_for_Better_Performance_and_Scalability.html">636 high scalability-2009-06-23-Learn How to Exploit Multiple Cores for Better Performance and Scalability</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Robert Scobleis a kind of Brothers Grimm for the digital age. Instead of
inspired romantics walking around the country side collecting the folk tales
of past ages, he is an inspired technologist documenting the current mythology
of startups.One of the developments Robert is exploring is the rise of
thecontextual age. Where every bit of information about you is continually
being prodded, pulled, and observed, shoveled into a great learning machine,
and turned into a fully actionableknowledge graphof context. A digital
identity more real to software than your physical body ever was. Sinner or
saviour, the Age of Context has interesting implications for startups. It
raises the entrance bar to dizzying heights. Much of the reason companies are
tearing down the Golden Age of the Web, one open protocol at a time, is to
create a walled garden of monopolized information.To operate in this world you
will have to somehow create a walled garden of your own. And it will be a damn
big garden. So yo</p><p>same-blog 2 0.97725689 <a title="1276-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-04-Top_Features_of_a_Scalable_Database.html">1276 high scalability-2012-07-04-Top Features of a Scalable Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Douglas Wilson, EMEA Field Application Engineer at
Raima, based on insights from biulding theirRaima Database Manager.Scalability
and HardwareScalability is the ability to maintain performance as demands on
the system increase, by adding further resources. Normally those resources
will be in the form of hardware. Since processor speeds are no longer
increasing much, scaling up the hardware normally means adding extra
processors or cores, and more memory.Scalability and SoftwareHowever,
scalability requires software that can utilize the extra hardware effectively.
The software must be designed to allow parallel processing. In the context of
a database engine this means that the server component must be multi-threaded,
to allow the operating system to schedule parallel tasks on all the cores that
are available. Not only that, but the database engine must provide an
efficient way to break its workload into as many parallel tasks as there are
cores. So, for example,</p><p>3 0.97043687 <a title="1276-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-20-Paper%3A_Log-structured_Memory_for_DRAM-based_Storage_-_High_Memory_Utilization_Plus_High_Performance.html">1616 high scalability-2014-03-20-Paper: Log-structured Memory for DRAM-based Storage - High Memory Utilization Plus High Performance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Most every programmer who gets sucked into deep performance analysis for long
running processes eventually realizes memory allocation is the heart of evil
at the center of many of their problems. So you replace malloc with something
less worse. Or you tune your garbage collector like a fine ukulele. But
there's a smarter approach brought to you from the folks atRAMCloud, a
Stanford University production, which is a large scale, distributed, in-memory
key-value database.What they've found is that typical memory management
approaches don't work and using a log structured approach yields massive
benefits:Performance measurements of log-structured memory in RAMCloud show
that it enables high client through- put at 80-90% memory utilization, even
with artificially stressful workloads. In the most stressful workload, a
single RAMCloud server can support 270,000-410,000 durable 100-byte writes per
second at 90% memory utilization. The two-level approach to cleaning improves
performance by up</p><p>4 0.97023726 <a title="1276-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-19-Big_Iron_Returns_with_BigMemory.html">1118 high scalability-2011-09-19-Big Iron Returns with BigMemory</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Greg Luck Founder and CTO,EhcacheTerracotta Inc.Note:
this article contains a bit too much of a product pitch, but the points are
still generally valid and useful.The legendary Moore's Law, which states that
the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on an integrated
circuit doubles approximately every two years, has held true since 1965. It
follows that integrated circuits will continue to get smaller, with chip
fabrication currently at a minuscule 22nm process (1). Users of big iron
hardware, or servers that are dense in terms of CPU power and memory capacity,
benefit from this trend as their hardware becomes cheaper and more powerful
over time. At some point soon, however, density limits imposed by quantum
mechanics will preclude further density increases.At the same time, low-cost
commodity hardware influences enterprise architects to scale their
applications horizontally, where processing is spread across clusters of low-
cost commodity serv</p><p>5 0.96555811 <a title="1276-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-27-How_I_Learned_to_Stop_Worrying_and_Love_Using_a_Lot_of_Disk_Space_to_Scale.html">327 high scalability-2008-05-27-How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Using a Lot of Disk Space to Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 3: ReadWriteWeb saysGoogle App Engine Announces New Pricing Plans,
APIs, Open Access. Pricing is specified but I'm not sure what to make of it
yet. An image manipulation library is added (thus the need to pay for more CPU
:-) and memcached support has been added. Memcached will help resolve the
can't write for every read problem that pops up when keeping counters.Update
2: onGWT.com threw a GAE load party and a lot of people came. The results
atLoad test : Google App Engine = 1, Community = 0. GAE handled a peak of 35
requests/second and a sustained 10 requests/second. Some think performance was
good, others not so good. My GMT watch broke and I was late to arrive. Maybe
next time. Also added a few new design rules from the post.Update: Added a few
new rules gleaned from theGAE Meetup: Design By Explicit Cost Model and Puts
are Precious.How do you structure your database using a distributed hash table

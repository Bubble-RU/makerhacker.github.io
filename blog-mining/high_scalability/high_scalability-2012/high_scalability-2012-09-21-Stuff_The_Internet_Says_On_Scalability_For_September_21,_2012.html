<p>Introduction: RAMCube is a datacenter oriented design for RAM-based key-value store that
supports thousands or tens of thousands of servers to offer up to hundreds of
terabytes of RAM storage. Here's thePDF Paper describing the system and here's
avideo of the presentationgiven atHotCloud.The big idea is: RAMCube exploits
the proximity of a BCube network to construct a symmetric MultiRing structure,
restricting all failure detection and recovery trafﬁc within a one-hop
neighborhood, which addresses problems including false failure detection and
recovery trafﬁc congestion. In addition, RAMCube leverages BCube's multiple
paths between any pairs of servers to handle switch failures.A few notes:75%
of Facebook data is stored in memcache.RAM is 1000 time faster than diskRAM is
used in caches, but this increases application complexity as applications are
responsible for cache consistency.Under a high work load a 1% cache miss rate
can lead to a 10x performance penalty.So store data directly in RAM instead</p><p>3 0.14961168 <a title="1327-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>6 0.12567081 <a title="1327-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Are_Cloud_Based_Memory_Architectures_the_Next_Big_Thing%3F.html">538 high scalability-2009-03-16-Are Cloud Based Memory Architectures the Next Big Thing?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you are trying to create highly available file systems, especially across
data centers, then ChironFS is one potential solution. It's relatively new, so
there aren't lots of experience reports, but it looks worth considering. What
isChironFSand how does it work?Adapted from the ChironFS website:The Chiron
Filesystem is a Fuse based filesystem that frees you from single points of
failure. It's main purpose is to guarantee filesystem availability using
replication. But it isn't a RAID implementation. RAID replicates DEVICES not
FILESYSTEMS.Why not just use RAID over some network block device? Because it
is a block device and if one server mounts that device in RW mode, no other
server will be able to mount it in RW mode. Any real network may have many
servers and offer a variety of services. Keeping everything running can become
a real nightmare!</p><p>2 0.95517612 <a title="1327-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome_List_of_Advanced_Distributed_Systems_Papers.html">1049 high scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome List of Advanced Distributed Systems Papers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Deploying, running and monitoring application on a big cluster is a
challenging task. RecentlyHazelcastteam deployed a demo application on Amazon
EC2 platform to show how Hazelcast p2p cluster scales and screen recorded the
entire process from deployment to monitoring.Hazelcast is open source (Apache
License), transactional, distributed caching solution for Java. It is a little
more than a cache though as it provides distributed implementation of map,
multimap, queue, topic, lock and executor service. Details of running 100 node
Hazelcast cluster on Amazon EC2 can befound here. Make sure towatch the
screencast!</p><p>4 0.94602519 <a title="1327-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-12-Paper%3A_Mind_the_Gap%3A_Reconnecting_Architecture_and_OS_Research.html">1039 high scalability-2011-05-12-Paper: Mind the Gap: Reconnecting Architecture and OS Research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mind the Gap: Reconnecting Architecture and OS Research is a paper presented
atHotOS XIII, the place where researchers talk about making potential futures
happen. For a great overview of the conference take a look at this article by
Matt Welsh: Conference report: HotOS 2011 in Napa.In the VM/cloud age I
question the need of having an OS at all, programs can compile directly
against "raw" hardware, but the paper does a good job of trying to figure out
the new roll operating systems can play in the future. We've been in a long OS
holding pattern, so long that we've seen the rise of PaaS vendors skipping the
OS level abstraction completely, but there's room for a middle ground between
legacy time sharing systems of the past and service level APIs that are but
one possible future.Introduction:For too long, operating systems researchers
and developers have pretty much taken whatever computer architects have dished
out. With occasional exceptions (e.g., virtualization support), architecture</p><p>5 0.93833625 <a title="1327-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-02-Stack_Overflow_Makes_Slow_Pages_100x_Faster_by_Simple_SQL_Tuning.html">1032 high scalability-2011-05-02-Stack Overflow Makes Slow Pages 100x Faster by Simple SQL Tuning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The most common complaint against NoSQL is that if you know how to write good
SQL queries then SQL works fine. If SQL is slow you can always tune it and
make it faster. A great example of this incremental improvement process was
written up by StackExchange's Sam Saffron, in A day in the life of a slow page
at Stack Overflow, where he shows through profiling and SQL tuning it was
possible to reduce page load times from 630ms to 40ms for some pages and for
other pages the improvement was 100x.Sam provides a lot of wonderful detail of
his tuning process, how it works, the thought process, the tools used, and the
tradeoffs involved. Here's a short summary of the steps:Using theirmini-
profiler it was shown that abadge detail pagewas taking 630.3 ms to load,
298.1 ms of that was spent on SQL queries, and then the tool listed the SQL
queries for the page and how long each took.From the historical logs, which
are stored inHAProxy on a month-by-month basis, Sam was able to determine this

<p>Introduction: RAMCube is a datacenter oriented design for RAM-based key-value store that supports thousands or tens of thousands of servers to offer up to hundreds of terabytes of RAM storage. Here's the  PDF Paper  describing the system and here's a  video of the presentation  given at  HotCloud .
 
The big idea is: RAMCube exploits the proximity of a BCube network to construct a symmetric MultiRing structure, restricting all failure detection and recovery trafﬁc within a one-hop neighborhood, which addresses problems including false failure detection and recovery trafﬁc congestion. In addition, RAMCube leverages BCube’s multiple paths between any pairs of servers to handle switch failures.
 
A few notes:
  
 75% of Facebook data is stored in memcache. 
 RAM is 1000 time faster than disk 
 RAM is used in caches, but this increases application complexity as applications are responsible for cache consistency. 
 Under a high work load a 1% cache miss rate can lead to a 10x performance penalty.

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.

  @kellabyte : XBOX Live scaling up from 15,000 servers to 300,000 servers. That's some scale right there. 
  @giuseppegurgone : [...] that could work for small projects. "why do we worry about scalability on day 1?" because tomorrow it could be too late :) 
  Max Boot : American troops found their tactics and technology, still designed to defeat an opponent like the now defunct Red Army, woefully inadequate to deal with these new threats. In this sort of war, there were no flanks to turn, few bastions to storm, no capitals to seize.

  Hendrik Volkmer : Complexity + Scale => Reduced Reliability + Increased Chance of catastrophic failures 
  @TheRealHirsty : This coffee could use some "scalability" 
  @billcurtis_ : Angular.js with Magento + S3 json file caching = wicked scalability

  Anil Dash : Terms of Service and IP trump the Constitution 
  Jeremy Zawodny : Yeah, seek time matters. A lot. 
  @joeweinman : @adrianco proves why auto scaling is better than curated capacity management. < 50% + Cost Saving 
  @ascendantlogic : Any "framework" naturally follows this progression. Something is complex so someone does something to make it easier. Everyone rushes to it but needs one or two things from the technologies they left behind so they introduce that into the "new"</p><p>6 0.83561337 <a title="1327-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-25-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_25th%2C_2014.html">1637 high scalability-2014-04-25-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 25th, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you are trying to create highly available file systems, especially across data centers,  then ChironFS is one potential solution. It's relatively new, so there aren't lots of experience reports, but it looks worth considering. What is  ChironFS  and how does it work?
 
Adapted from the ChironFS website:   The Chiron Filesystem is a Fuse based filesystem that frees you from single points of failure. It's main purpose is to guarantee filesystem availability using replication. But it isn't a RAID implementation. RAID replicates DEVICES not FILESYSTEMS.  Why not just use RAID over some network block device? Because it is a block device and if one server mounts that device in RW mode, no other server will be able to mount it in RW mode. Any real network may have many servers and offer a variety of services. Keeping everything running can become a real nightmare!</p><p>2 0.95517612 <a title="1327-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome_List_of_Advanced_Distributed_Systems_Papers.html">1049 high scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome List of Advanced Distributed Systems Papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As part of  Dr. Indranil Gupta 's  CS 525 Spring 2011 Advanced Distributed Systems  class, he has collected an incredible  list of resources on distributed systems . His  research group  is also doing some interesting work.

<p>Introduction: Deploying, running and monitoring application on a big cluster is a challenging task. Recently  Hazelcast  team deployed a demo application on Amazon EC2 platform to show how Hazelcast p2p cluster scales and screen recorded the entire process from deployment to monitoring.
 
Hazelcast is open source (Apache License), transactional, distributed caching solution for Java. It is a little more than a cache though as it provides distributed implementation of map, multimap, queue, topic, lock and executor service.Â 
 
Details of running 100 node Hazelcast cluster on Amazon EC2 can be  found here .

<p>Introduction: Mind the Gap: Reconnecting Architecture and OS Research  is a paper presented at  HotOS XIII , the place where researchers talk about making potential futures happen. For a great overview of the conference take a look at this article by Matt Welsh:  Conference report: HotOS 2011 in Napa .
 
In the VM/cloud age I question the need of having an OS at all, programs can compile directly against "raw" hardware, but the paper does a good job of trying to figure out the new roll operating systems can play in the future. We've been in a long OS holding pattern, so long that we've seen the rise of PaaS vendors skipping the OS level abstraction completely, but there's room for a middle ground between legacy time sharing systems of the past and service level APIs that are but one possible future.
 
Introduction:
  For too long, operating systems researchers and developers have pretty much taken whatever computer architects have dished out. With occasional exceptions (e.g., virtualization support)</p><p>5 0.93833625 <a title="1327-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-02-Stack_Overflow_Makes_Slow_Pages_100x_Faster_by_Simple_SQL_Tuning.html">1032 high scalability-2011-05-02-Stack Overflow Makes Slow Pages 100x Faster by Simple SQL Tuning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The most common complaint against NoSQL is that if you know how to write good SQL queries then SQL works fine. If SQL is slow you can always tune it and make it faster. A great example of this incremental improvement process was written up by StackExchange's Sam Saffron, in  A day in the life of a slow page at Stack Overflow , where he shows through profiling and SQL tuning it was possible to reduce page load times from 630ms to 40ms for some pages and for other pages the improvement was 100x.
 
Sam provides a lot of wonderful detail of his tuning process, how it works, the thought process, the tools used, and the tradeoffs involved. Here's a short summary of the steps:
  
 Using their  mini-profiler  it was shown that a  badge detail page  was taking 630.3 ms to load, 298.1 ms of that was spent on SQL queries, and then the tool listed the SQL queries for the page and how long each took. 
 From the historical logs, which are stored in  HAProxy  on a month-by-month basis, Sam was able t</p><p>6 0.93661833 <a title="1327-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-12-100_Curse_Free_Lessons_from_Gordon_Ramsay_on_Building_Great_Software.html">1500 high scalability-2013-08-12-100 Curse Free Lessons from Gordon Ramsay on Building Great Software</a></p>

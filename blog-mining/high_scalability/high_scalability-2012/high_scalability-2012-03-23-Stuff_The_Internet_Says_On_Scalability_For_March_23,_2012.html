<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

undervalued and under-discussed asset on the web.Update 7:How do you know when
you need more memcache servers?. Dathan Pattishall talks about using memcache
not to scale, but to reduce latency and reduce I/O spikes, and how to use
stats to know when more servers are needed.Update 6:Stock Traders Find Speed
Pays, in Milliseconds. Goldman Sachs is making record profits off a500
millisecondtrading advantage. Yes, latency matters. As an interesting aside,
Libet found 500 msecs is about the time it takes the brain to weave together
an experience of consciousness from all our sensor inputs.Update 5:Shopzilla's

<p>Introduction: Shanti Braforddetails how his Ruby on Railsbased website survived a 24 hour
550,000+ pageview digg attack. His post cleanly lays out all the juicy setup
details, so there's not much I can add.Hosting costs $370 a month for 1 web
server, 1 database server, and sufficient bandwidth. The site is built on RoR,
nginx, MySQL, and 7 mongrel servers. He thinks Rails 2.0 has improved
performance and credits database avoidance and fragment caching for much of
the performance boost.Keep in mind his system is relatively static, but it's a
very interesting and useful experience report.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.90287268 <a title="1214-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-23-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_23%2C_2012.html">1214 high scalability-2012-03-23-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 23, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Morgan Tocker has an awesome article and comment thread in theMySQL
Performance BlogaboutWhen should you store serialized objects in the
database?Before the NoSQL age is was very common to simulate schemalessness by
storing blobs in MySQL. Sharding was implemented by running multiple MySQL
instances and spreading writes across them. While not ideal for the purpose,
developers felt comfortable with MySQL. They knew how to install it, back it
up, replicate it, in short:  they knew how to make it work. Yet they also
needed to store objects without the penalty of joins. Searches and aggregate
queries were handled by indexes kept in separate tables, this offloaded the
fast path to objects.This all made perfect sense. Usually we just want stuff
to work and going with what you know is often the best path to that goal. And
what we have known is MySQL. All the different pros and cons of this approach
are covered wonderfully in the post.But the world has changed. With the same
goals in mind I do</p><p>6 0.86603653 <a title="1214-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-28-ID_generation_schemes.html">346 high scalability-2008-06-28-ID generation schemes</a></p>

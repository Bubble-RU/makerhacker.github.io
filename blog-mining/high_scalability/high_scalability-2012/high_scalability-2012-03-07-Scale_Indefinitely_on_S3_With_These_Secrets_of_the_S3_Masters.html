<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built
by a small group of people, under immense pressure, trying to get a lot of

<p>Introduction: I've been getting asked about this a lot lately so I figured I'd just blog
about it. Products like WebSphere eXtreme Scale work by taking a dataset,
partitioning it using a key and then assigning those partitions to a number of
JVMs. Each partition usually has a primary and a replica. These 'shards' are
assigned to JVMs. A transactional application typically interacts with the
data on a single partition at a time. This means the transaction is executed
in a single JVM. A server box will be able to do M of those transactions per
second and it scales because N boxes does MN (M multiplied by N) transactions
per second. Increase N, you get more transactions per second. Availability is
very good because a transaction only depends on 1 of the N servers that are
currently online. Any of the other (N-1) servers can go down or fail with no
impact on the transaction. So, single partition transactions can scale
indefinitely from a throughput point of view, offer very consistent response
times and</p><p>4 0.15178747 <a title="1205-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-02-Distributed_Hashing_Algorithms_by_Example%3A_Consistent_Hashing.html">892 high scalability-2010-09-02-Distributed Hashing Algorithms by Example: Consistent Hashing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Consistent Hashing is a specific implementation of hashing that is well suited
for many of today's web-scale load balancing problems. Specifically, it can be
seen in use in various caching solutions like Memcached and is applicable to
NoSQL solutions as well. Consistent Hashing is used particularly because it
provides a solution for the typical "hashcode mod n" method of distributing
keys across a series of servers. It does this by allowing servers to be added
or removed without significantly upsetting the distribution of keys, nor does
it require that all keys be rehashed to accommodate the change in the number
of servers.ďťżYou can read the full storehere.</p><p>5 0.14971545 <a title="1205-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-04-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_October_5%2C_2012.html">1334 high scalability-2012-10-04-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For October 5, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: TheEuroSys 2012system conference has an excellent live blog summary of their
talks for:Day 1,Day 2,Day 3(thanksHenry at the Paper Trail blog). Summaries
for each of the accepted papers arehere.One of the more interesting papers
from a NoSQL perspective wasCache Craftiness for Fast Multicore Key-Value
Storage, a wonderfully detailed description of the low level techniques used
to implement Masstree:A storage system specialized for key-value data in which
all data ﬁts in memory, but must persist across server restarts. It supports
arbitrary, variable-length keys. It allows range queries over those keys:
clients can traverse subsets of the database, or the whole database, in sorted
order by key. On a 16-core machine Masstree achieves six to ten million
operations per second on parts A-C of the Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark
benchmark, more than 30 as fast as VoltDB [5] or MongoDB [2].If you are
looking for innovative detailed high performance design, this paper is for
you.

which they try to answer critics by going into more depth about their

million transactions a second.Benchmarks are always a dark mirror, so make of
them what you will, but the target market for MemSQL is clear: projects
looking for something both fast and familiar. Fast as in a novel design using
a combination of technologies likeMVCC, code generation,lock-free data
structures,skip lists, andin-memory execution. Familiar as in SQL and nothing
but SQL. The only interface to MemSQL is SQL.It's right to point out MemSQL
gets a boost by being a first release. Only a limited subset of SQL is

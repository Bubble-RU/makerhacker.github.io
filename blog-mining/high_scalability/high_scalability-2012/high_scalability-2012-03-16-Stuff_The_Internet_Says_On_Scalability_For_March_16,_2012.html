<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>3 0.13023371 <a title="1210-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Are_Cloud_Based_Memory_Architectures_the_Next_Big_Thing%3F.html">538 high scalability-2009-03-16-Are Cloud Based Memory Architectures the Next Big Thing?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-
grid.It's 2003: Add a caching layer.It's 2004: Add scale-out and
partitioning.It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a

<p>Introduction: With Amazonannouncing new High I/O 2TB SSD instancesthe age of SSD has almost
arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on
demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on
demand rate theprice per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:27 cents
($27K/100K IOPS) per vs$1.25 for disk.With the obvious benefits of giant SSD
machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it's interesting to consider: what
architecture decisions might you make differently in the future?More Headroom
for Vertical Scaling Simplifies EverythingThe beauty of higher hardware
performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows
developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This
has always been the allure ofvertical scalingand is well realized by SSDs
through a combination of high throughput, low latencies, and just as
important, high densities.We have a few early examples showing the performance

vision of a future. Not everyone agrees, but I guess we'll see..."But it is
not complicated. [There's] just a lot of it." \--Richard Feynmanon how the

<p>Introduction: At the heart of every software adventure exists a journey in service of a
quest. Melodramatic much? Sorry, but while wandering dazzled throughRace to
the End of the Earth, a fantastic exhibit at theRoyal BC Museumon the
1911-1912race to the South Polebetween Norwegian explorerRoald Amundsenand
British naval officerRobert Scott, I couldn't help but think of the two
radically different approaches each team took to the race and it shocked me to
see that some of the same principles that lead to success or failure in
software development also seem to lead to success or failure in exploration.I
wish I could reproduce the experience ofwalking through the exhibit. Plaque
after plaque I remember wondering out loud at Scott's choices and then nod in
agreement with Amundsen's approach. The core conflict was straight out of any
ancient Agile (Amundsen) vs Waterfall (Scott) thread you can find on Usenet.

<p>Introduction: Brian Zimmer, architect at travel startup Yapta, highlights some worst
practices jeopardizing the growth and scalability of a system:* The Golden
Hammer. Forcing a particular technology to work in ways it was not intended is
sometimes counter-productive. Using a database to store key-value pairs is one
example. Another example is using threads to program for concurrency.*
Resource Abuse. Manage the availability of shared resources because when they
fail, by definition, their failure is experienced pervasively rather than in
isolation. For example, connection management to the database through a thread
pool.* Big Ball of Mud. Failure to manage dependencies inhibits agility and
scalability.* Everything or Something. In both code and application dependency
management, the worst practice is not understanding the relationships and
formulating a model to facilitate their management. Failure to enforce
diligent control is a contributing scalability inhibiter.* Forgetting to check
the time.

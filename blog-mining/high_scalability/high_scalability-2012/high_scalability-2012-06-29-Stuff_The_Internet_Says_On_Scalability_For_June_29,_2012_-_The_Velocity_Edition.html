<p>Introduction: A big part of engineering for a quality experience is bringing in the  long tail . An improbable severe failure can ruin your experience of a site, even if your average experience is quite good. That's where building for  resilience  comes in. Resiliency used to be outside the realm of possibility for the common system. It was simply too complex and too expensive.
 
An evolution has been underway, making 2013 possibly the first time resiliency is truly on the table as a standard part of system architectures. We are getting the clouds, we are getting the tools, and prices are almost low enough.
 
Even Netflix,  real leaders  in the resiliency architecture game, took some heat for relying completely on Amazon's ELB and not having a backup load balancing system, leading to a prolonged  Christmas Eve failure . Adrian Cockcroft, Cloud Architect at Netflix,  said they've investigated  creating their own load balancing service, but that "we try not to invest in undifferentiated heavy lifting.</p><p>5 0.07593029 <a title="1274-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-03-Resiliency_is_the_New_Normal_-_A_Deep_Look_at_What_It_Means_and_How_to_Build_It.html">1366 high scalability-2012-12-03-Resiliency is the New Normal - A Deep Look at What It Means and How to Build It</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Perhaps it is because the whole world feels as if it’s riding on the edge of a jagged knife that the idea of   resilience    is becoming a dominant theme across so many domains. Resilience in beings first developed when cells evolved a way of    maintaining inner order    through homeostatic (stability through constancy) mechanisms. After homeostasis was mastered,    allostasis    (stability through change) developed as a way of responding to a dynamic world of challenge. In economics we have the idea of    Transition Towns   , which emphasizes developing local economies as a way of being resilient to global failures. In agriculture we have the idea of    permaculture   , building a permanent agriculture by embracing diversity, sustainability, perennial systems, avoiding monocultures, and using    edge thinking   . There are many more examples, including    psychological resilience    and the legendary    resilience of ecosystems   .

  @dbasch : The world is full of "scalability engineers" who would die from an orgasm if their software ever saw 10,000 requests in a day. 
  @mtnygard : “Scaling issues are always expressed as a queue backing up somewhere.” —@moonpolysoft #strangeloop 
  @rbranson : If your data fits in main memory, you're doing it wrong. #strangeloop 
  @peakscale : Using schemaless DBs an "overreaction" & "confuses the poor impl. of schemas with the value that schemas provide" 
  @adrianco : GM: Performance analysis is complicated by your brain thinking LINEARLY about a computer system that is NONLINEAR.  
  @littleidea : it's better to have infinite scalability and not need it, than to need infinite scalability and not have it

<p>Introduction: With the  Chapultepec aqueduct , also named  the great aqueduct , the  Aztecs  built a novel uninterruptible water supply for providing fresh water to  Tenochtitlan , their fast growing jewel of a capital city. A section of the aqueduct is still around today: 
 
     
 
It's fun to think about how even 600 years ago how it was built with high availability in mind. We find  engineers being engineers , no matter the age:
  

It consisted of a twin pipe distribution system made in part of compacted soil and in part of wood for the crossings of the aqueduct over the bridges built to allow the passage of the canoes. It was finished around 1466 AD, and the main purpose was to supply fresh water to Mexico-Tenochtitlan, to mitigate its thirst.


The main source for the aqueduct was the spring of Chapultepec and the purpose of the twin pipes was to ease the maintenance of the system, because the water was conveyed through one pipe, and when it got dirty, the water was diverted to the other pipe</p><p>same-blog 2 0.91047651 <a title="1274-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-29-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_29%2C_2012_-_The_Velocity_Edition.html">1274 high scalability-2012-06-29-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 29, 2012 - The Velocity Edition</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Judging from the tweet flow,  Velocity  looked like a riotous good time. In this video on the  main themes  at Velocity, after a little microphone enhanced violence, John Allspaw and Steve Souders identify  resilience  and  automation  as two of the big ideas behind building a faster and stronger web.
 
John says resiliency is the idea that we we don't live in a perfect world so trying to build perfect systems is counter productive. We have to accept failure as a baseline and think in terms of degrees of availability. All abstraction layers leak so every part of a system must be monitorable and open to introspection.
 
A focus on resilience means the web is growing up. Resilience has long been a requirement for "real" systems, it's great to see the web thinking in terms of the complex systems they've always been. For the Alpha and Omega on resilience you'll want to watch  Dr. Richard Cook's  inspiring talk on  How Complex Systems Fail .

<p>Introduction: A thoughtful reader recently suggested creating a series of posts based on real-life problems people have experienced and the solutions they've created to slay the little beasties. It's a great idea. Often we learn best from great trials and tribulations. I'll start off the new "Problem Report"  feature with a diabolical little problem I dubbed the "Mobbing the Least Used Resource Error."  Please post your own. And if you know someone with an interesting problem report, please tag them too. It could be a lot of fun. Of course, feel free to scrub your posts of all embarrassing details, but be sure to keep the heroic parts in :-)  
  The Problem  
 There's an unexpected and frequently fatal type of error that can happen when new resources are added to a horizontally scaled architecture. Because the new resource has the least of something, load or connections or whatever, a load balancer configured with a least metric will instantaneously direct all new traffic to that new resource.  And</p><p>4 0.85219699 <a title="1274-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-10-MONO_ASP.NET._Will_it_make_the_web%3F%3F%3F.html">206 high scalability-2008-01-10-MONO ASP.NET.

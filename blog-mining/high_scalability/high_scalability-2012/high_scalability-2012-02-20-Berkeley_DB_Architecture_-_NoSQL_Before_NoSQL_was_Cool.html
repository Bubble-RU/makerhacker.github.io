<p>Introduction: breakThis JoelOnSoftwarethreadasks the age old question of what and how to
log. The usual trace/error/warning/info advice is totally useless in a large
scale distributed system. Instead, you need tolog everything all the timeso
you can solve problems that have already happened across a potentially huge
range of servers. Yes, it can be done.To see why the typical logging approach
is broken, imagine this scenario: Your site has been up and running great for
weeks. No problems. A foreshadowing beeper goes off at 2AM. It seems some
users can no longer add comments to threads. Then you hear the debugging
deathknell: it's an intermittent problem and customers are pissed. Fix it.
Now.So how are you going to debug this? The monitoring system doesn't show any
obvious problems or errors. You quickly post a comment and it works fine. This
won't be easy. So you think. Commenting involves a bunch of servers and
networks. There's the load balancer, spam filter, web server, database server,
caching s</p><p>4 0.12343079 <a title="1196-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-11-Friendster_Architecture.html">6 high scalability-2007-07-11-Friendster Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Partitioning is what differentiates scaling-out from scaling-up, isn't it? I
thought so too until I readPat Helland's blog post on Hyder, a research
database at Microsoft, in whichthe database is the log, no partitioning is
required, and the database is multi-versioned. Not much is available on Hyder.
There's the excellent summary post from Mr. Helland and these documents:
Scaling Out without Partitioning andScaling Out without Partitioning  \- Hyder
Update by Phil Bernstein and Colin Reid of Microsoft.The idea behind Hyder as
summarized by Pat Helland (see his blog for the full post):Hyder is a software
stack for transactional record management. It can offer full database
functionality and is designed to take advantage of flash in a novel way. Most
approaches to scale-out use partitioning and spread the data across multiple
machines leaving the application responsible for consistency. In Hyder, the
database is the log, no partitioning is required, and the database is multi-
versioned.</p><p>3 0.63320649 <a title="1196-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-24-Product%3A_Scribe_-_Facebook%27s_Scalable_Logging_System.html">449 high scalability-2008-11-24-Product: Scribe - Facebook's Scalable Logging System</a></p>
<p>Introduction: InLog Everything All the TimeI advocate applications shouldn't bother logging
at all. Why waste all that time and code? No, wait, that's not right. I preach
logging everything all the time. Doh. Facebook obviously feels similarly which
is why they opened sourcedScribe, their internal logging system, capable of
logging 10s of billions of messages per day. These messages include access
logs, performance statistics, actions that went to News Feed, and many
others.Imagine hundreds of thousands of machines across many geographical
dispersed datacenters just aching to send their precious log payload to the
central repository off all knowledge. Because really, when you combine all the
meta data with all the events you pretty much have a complete picture of your
operations. Once in the central repository logs can be scanned, indexed,
summarized, aggregated, refactored, diced, data cubed, and mined for every
scrap of potentially useful information.Just imagine the log stream from all
of Faceboo</p><p>4 0.63293391 <a title="1196-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-01-Statistics_Logging_Scalability.html">105 high scalability-2007-10-01-Statistics Logging Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My company is developing a centralized web platform to service our clients. We
currently use about 3Mb/s on our uplink at our ISP serving web pages for about
100 clients. We'd like to offer them statistics that mean something to their
businesses and have been contemplating writing our own statistics code to
handle the task.All statistics would be gathered at the page view level and
we're implementing a HttpModule in ASP.Net 2.0 to handle the gather of the
data. That said, I'm curious to hear comments on writing this data (~500 bytes
of log data/page request). We need to write this data somewhere and then build
a process to aggregate the data into a warehouse application used in our
reporting system. Google Analytics is out of the question because we do not
want our hosting infrastructure dependant upon a remote server. Web Trends et
al. are too expensive for our clients.I'm thinking of a couple of options.1)

<p>Introduction: AWStatsis a free powerful and featureful tool that generates advanced web,
streaming, ftp or mail server statistics, graphically. This log analyzer works
as a CGI or from command line and shows you all possible information your log
contains, in few graphical web pages. It uses a partial information file to be
able to process large log files, often and quickly. It can analyze log files
from all major server tools like Apache log files (NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log
format or common/CLF log format), WebStar, IIS (W3C log format) and a lot of
other web, proxy, wap, streaming servers, mail servers and some ftp servers.</p><p>6 0.62775505 <a title="1196-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Product%3A_Smart_Inspect.html">541 high scalability-2009-03-16-Product: Smart Inspect</a></p>

<p>Introduction: After the filesystem and simple library packages likedbm, Berkeley DBwas the
original luxury embedded database widely used by applications as their core
database engine. NoSQL before NoSQL was cool. The hidden secret making complex
applications sing. If you want to dispense with all the network overhead of a
server based system, it's still a a good choice.There's a great writeup for
the architecture behind Berkeley DB in the book The Architecture of Open
Source Applications. If you want to understand more about how a database works
or if you are pondering how to build your own, it's rich in detail,
explanations, and lessons. Here's theBerkeley DB  chapter from the book. It
covers topics like: Architectural Overview; The Access Methods: Btree, Hash,
Recno, Queue; The Library Interface Layer; The Buffer Manager: Mpool; Write-
ahead Logging; The Lock Manager: Lock; The Log Manager: Log; The Transaction
Manager: Txn. Related Articles Berkeley DB: A Retrospective by Margo SeltzerOn

<p>Introduction: Monitor, monitor, monitor. That's the advice every startup gives once they
reach a certain size. But can you ever monitor enough? If you are Bitly and
everyone will complain when you are down, probably not.Here are 10 Things We
Forgot to Monitor from Bitly, along with good stories and copious amounts of
code snippets. Well worth reading, especially after you've already started
monitoring the lower hanging fruit.An interesting revelation from the article
is that:We run bitly split across two data centers, one is a managed
environment with DELL hardware, and the second is Amazon EC2.  Fork Rate. A
strange configuration issue caused processes to be created at a rate of
several hundred a second rather than the expected 1-10/second. Flow control
packets.  A network configuration that honors flow control packets and isn't
configured to disable them, can temporarily cause dropped traffic.Swap In/Out
Rate. Measure the right thing. It's the rate memory is swapped in/out that can

<p>Introduction: It's time to do something a little different and for me that doesn't mean
cutting off my hair and joining a monastery, nor does it mean buying a cherry
red convertible (yet), it means doing a webinar!On December 14th, 2:00 PM -
3:00 PM EST, I'll be hosting What Should I Do? Choosing SQL, NoSQL or Both for
Scalable Web Applications.The webinar is sponsored by VoltDB, but it will be
completely vendor independent, as that's the only honor preserving and
technically accurate way of doing these things.The webinar will run about 60
minutes, with 40 minutes of speechifying and 20 minutes for questions.The
hashtag for the event on Twitter will beSQLNoSQL. I'll be monitoring that
hashtag if you have any suggestions for the webinar or if you would like to
ask questions during the webinar. The motivation for me to do the webinar was
a talk I had with another audience member at theNoSQL Evening in Palo Alto. He
said he came from a Java background and was confused about the future. His

<p>Introduction: Update 2:   YouTube Reaches One Billion Views Per Day .  That’s at least 11,574 views per second, 694,444 views per minute, and 41,666,667 views per hour.     Update:   YouTube: The Platform . YouTube adds a new rich set of APIs in order to become your video platform leader--all for free. Upload, edit, watch, search, and comment on video from your own site without visiting YouTube. Compose your site internally from APIs because you'll need to expose them later anyway.   YouTube grew incredibly fast, to over 100 million video views per day, with only a handful of people responsible for scaling the site. How did they manage to deliver all that video to all those users? And how have they evolved since being acquired by Google?

 Quotable Quotes:                           
 
  @jezhumble : Google does everything off trunk despite 10k devs across 40 offices.  
  @KentLangley : "in 2016. When it goes online, the SKA is expected to produce 700 terabytes of data each day"  
  Jonathan Marks : It's actually a talk about how NOT to be creative. And what he [John Cleese] describes is the way most international broadcasters operated for most of their existence. They were content factories, slave to an artificial transmission schedule. Because they didn't take time to be creative, then ended up sounding like a tape machine. They were run by a computer algorithm. Not a human soul. There was never room for a creative pause. Routine was the solution. And that's creativities biggest enemy.

  @ibogost : Disabling features of SimCity due to ineffective central infrastructure is probably the most realistic simulation of the modern city. 
  antirez : The point is simply to show how SSDs can't be considered, currently, as a bit slower version of memory. Their performance characteristics are a lot more about, simply, "faster disks". 
  @jessenoller : I only use JavaScript so I can gain maximum scalability across multiple cores. Also unicorns. Paint thinner gingerbread 
  @liammclennan : high-scalability ruby. Why bother? 
  @scomma : Problem with BitCoin is not scalability, not even usability. It's whether someone will crack the algorithm and render BTC entirely useless. 
  @webclimber : Amazing how often I find myself explaining that scalability is not magical

<p>Introduction: With Amazon     announcing new High I/O 2TB SSD instances    the age of SSD has almost arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on demand rate the   price per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:   27 cents ($27K/100K IOPS) per vs    $1.25 for disk   .     With the obvious benefits of giant SSD machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it’s interesting to consider: what architecture decisions might you make differently in the future? 
   More Headroom for Vertical Scaling Simplifies Everything   
 The beauty of higher hardware performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This has always been the allure of    vertical scaling    and is well realized by SSDs through a combination of high throughput, low latencies, and just as important, high densities.

  @al3xandr3  : scalability demands decoupling 
 
  
  @startupandrew  : "Yesterday I did some digestive system scalability testing" -- in reference to eating 140 chicken nuggets 
 
  Peter Wayner  : While the crazy dreamers can continue to craft NoSQL data stores, serious people will want to take a look at Oracle's version. 
  @weblearning  : Unitil we get scalability - or that wonderful word massification - in education, we will not get value for money 
 Embrace and extend:  @conor_omahony  : IBM is Baking NoSQL Capabilities into DB2 and Informix.

  @jreichhold : One thing working at Twitter teaches me daily is that all scale is relative. What seemed impossible last year is now the daily case.

<p>Introduction: Hey, it's HighScalability time:
     (Leandro Erlich's super cool scaling illusion )   
 Who am I? I have 50 petabytes of data stored in Hadoop and Teradata, 400 million items for sale, 250 million queries a day, 100,000 pages served per second, 112 million active users, $75 billions sold in 2012...If you  guessed eBay  then you've won the auction. 
 Quotable Quotes:                                          
 
   Controlled Experiments at Large Scale : Bing found that every 100ms faster they deliver search result pages yields 0.6% more in revenue  
  Luis Bettencourt : A city is first and foremost a social reactor. It works like a star, attracting people and accelerating social interaction and social outputs in a way that is analogous to how stars compress matter and burn brighter and faster the bigger they are. 
  @nntaleb : unless you understand that fat tails come from concentration of errors, you should not discuss probability & risk

<p>Introduction: Awesome paper on how particular synchronization mechanisms scale on multi-core architectures:  Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Synchronization but Were Afraid to Ask .
 
The goal is to pick a locking approach that doesn't degrade as the number of cores increase. Like everything else in life, that doesn't appear to be generically possible:
  
 None of the nine locking schemes we consider consistently outperforms any other one, on all target architectures or workloads. Strictly speaking, to seek optimality,  a lock algorithm should thus be selected based on the hardware platform and the expected workload .  
  
Abstract:
  

This paper presents the most exhaustive study of synchronization to date. We span multiple layers, from hardware cache-coherence protocols up to high-level concurrent software. We do so on different types architectures, from single-socket – uniform and nonuniform – to multi-socket – directory and broadcastbased – many-cores. We draw a set of observations t</p><p>2 0.87948483 <a title="1178-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-25-Designing_applications_for_cloud_deployment.html">764 high scalability-2010-01-25-Designing applications for cloud deployment</a></p>
<p>Introduction: During the last two years, I was involved in several projects deployed on the Amazon cloud. Being a relatively early adopter was a fantastic experience that provided lots of opportunities to burn my fingers and learn from mistakes. It also seriously challenged my view of scalable software architectures. I spoke about key lessons learned at CloudCamp London last week – here is the summary of that presentation.﻿

  Similarity  : There is no canonical schema anymore. Instead you should ask: What high-volume queries will I need to serve with my data? Then work backwards from there. 
  @kvirjee  : Dis/Agree? -- "there is no problem but scalability, and architecture is its solution" 
  @robpegoraro  : Eternal vigilance can be crowdsourced.

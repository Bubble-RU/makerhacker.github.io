</p><p>5 5 msecs for the database component, depending on the size of your data. [sent-22, score-0.172]
</p><p>6 A problem with the cloud is noisy neighbors can ruin the performance of other neighbors. [sent-33, score-0.147]
</p><p>7 To ensure DynamoDB can meet SLAs in a multi-tenancy environment, a maximum size restriction of 64KB is put on values. [sent-34, score-0.115]
</p><p>8 By fixing the data sizes and requiring the specification for a guaranteed throughput rate, DynamoDB has all the information it needs to schedule workloads in such a way as they can meet their SLAs with a high degree of confidence. [sent-36, score-0.263]
</p><p>9 A downside of the provisioned throughput model is you pay for the throughput you have reserved, not the traffic you have actually generated. [sent-38, score-0.361]
</p><p>10 From Amazon's perspective they are reserving the capacity so in a sense you are using the capacity, but this is the same capacity planning issue that made the elastic nature of the cloud so attractive to begin with. [sent-39, score-0.248]
</p><p>11 And if your traffic is at all bursty you technically would have to reserve the peak usage, which is fiscal insanity. [sent-43, score-0.152]
</p><p>12 You can adjust your throughput reservation, but you can't do it fast enough to meet a burst, and the drop notification mechanisms are clumsy, you get an email alert and then have to do the adjustment by hand. [sent-44, score-0.244]
</p><p>13 A lack of transactionsmeans developers have to implement idempotency, garbage collection, and pay for all the accesses needed to implement features that DynamoDB should be supporting. [sent-50, score-0.223]
</p><p>14 The provisioning model is not really automatic as hot keys are not automatically load balanced. [sent-53, score-0.145]
</p><p>15 Eventually more functionality will be built into the dashboard, but it's a powerful way to look at your data, just factor this kind of management traffic into your throughput requirements. [sent-71, score-0.181]
</p><p>16 Store Hot Data in DynamoDB, Cold Data in S3, and use Hadoop/Hive to Make them Look the SameOne of the most interesting ideas of the talk is how a new Hadoop/Hive ecosystem is being used to act as a unifying bridge between DynamoDB and S3. [sent-72, score-0.13]
</p><p>17 The idea is that data stored in DynamoDB costs 10 times as much as data in S3, so what you want to do is move historical or cold data to S3 as soon possible and just keep the hot data in DynamoDB. [sent-73, score-0.511]
</p><p>18 For example, time series data is often stored by day, week, or month, so rather than keep all that historical time series data in DynamoDB, move it to S3 and save some money. [sent-74, score-0.208]
</p><p>19 The problem is now you have two very different ways to access data. [sent-75, score-0.1]
</p><p>20 Using EMR and Hive sophisticated queries can be run against data in DynamoDB and S3, allowing a common data access layer against the cheapest storage option. [sent-78, score-0.195]

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byBen BromheadfromInstaclustrDeciding to use a managed
NoSQL datastore is a great step in ensuring you run a fast, scalable and
resilient application without needing to be an expert in highly available
architecture. How do you know which technology is the best for your
application? How do you know whether the provider's performance claims are
true? You are putting your application on someone elseâ€™s infrastructure and
that requires some hard answers about their claims.To determine the
suitability of a provider, your first port of call is to benchmark. Choosing a
service provider is often done in a number of stages. First is to shortlist
providers based on capabilities and claimed performance, ruling out those that
do not meet your application requirements. Second is to look for benchmarks
conducted by third parties, if any. The final stage is to benchmark the
service yourself.In this article we will show you how to run some preliminary

<p>Introduction: My impression of DynamoDB before attending aAmazon DynamoDB for Developerstalk
is that it's the usual quality service produced by Amazon: simple, fast,
scalable, geographically redundant, expensive enough to make you think twice
about using it, and delightfully NoOp.After the talk my impression has become
more nuanced. The quality impression still stands. Look at theforumsand you'll
see the typical issues every product has, but no real surprises. And as a
SimpleDB++, DynamoDB seems to have avoided second system syndrome and produced
a more elegant design.What was surprising is how un-cloudy DynamoDB appears to
be. The cloud pillars of pay for what you use and quick elastic response to
bursty traffic have been abandoned, for some understandable reasons, but the
result is you really have to consider your use cases before making DynamoDB
the default choice.Here are some of my impressions from the talk...DynamoDB is

creates tools for measuring, analyzing and optimizing web performance.  Did
you know that 5% of the pageviews on Walmart.com take over 20 seconds to load?
Walmart discovered this recently after adding real user measurement (RUM) to
analyze their web performance for every single visitor to their site. Walmart
used JavaScript to measure their median load time as well as key metrics like
their 95th percentile. While 20 seconds is a long time to wait for a website
to load,the Walmart storyis actually not that uncommon. Remember, this is the
worst 5% of their pageviews, not the typical experience.Walmart's median load
time was reported at around 4 seconds, meaning half of their visitors loaded
Walmart.com faster than 4 seconds and the other half took longer than 4
seconds to load. Using this knowledge, Walmart was prepared to act. By
reducing page load times by even one second, Walmart found that they would

<p>Introduction: You might think major Internet companies have a latency, availability, and
bandwidth advantage because they can afford expensive dedicated point-to-point
private line networks between their data centers. And you would be right. It's
a great advantage. Or it at least it was a great advantage. Cost is the great
equalizer and companies are now scrambling for ways to cut costs. Many of the
most recognizable Internet companies are moving to IP VPNs (Virtual Private
Networks) as a much cheaper alternative to private lines. This is a strategy
you can effectively use too.This trend has historical precedent in the data
center. In the same way leading edge companies moved early to virtualize their
data centers, leading edge companies are now virtualizing their networks using
IP VPNs to build inexpensive private networks over a shared public network. In
kindergarten we learned sharing was polite, it turns out sharing can also save
a lot of money in both the data center and on the network.The line</p><p>6 0.93053639 <a title="1245-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-15-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_15%2C_2013.html">1407 high scalability-2013-02-15-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 15, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Please see  The Updated Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage  for a new improved list. 
 
So many great articles have been written on the Amazon Outage. Some aim at being helpful, some chastise developers for being so stupid, some chastise Amazon for being so incompetent, some talk about the pain they and their companies have experienced, and some even predict the downfall of the cloud. Still others say we have seen a sea change in future of the cloud, a prediction that's hard to disagree with, though the shape of the change remains...cloudy.
 
I'll try to keep this list update as more information comes out. There will be a lot for developers to consider going forward. If there's a resource you think should be added, just let me know.

<p>Introduction: Since  The Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage  was published we've a had few updates that people might not have seen. Amazon of course released their  Summary of the Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS Service Disruption in the US East Region . Netlix shared their  Lessons Learned from the AWS Outage  as did Heroku ( How Heroku Survived the Amazon Outage ), Smug Mug ( How SmugMug survived the Amazonpocalypse ), and SimpleGeo ( How SimpleGeo Stayed Up During the AWS Downtime ). 
 
The curious thing from my perspective is the general lack of response to Amazon's explanation. I expected more discussion. There's been almost none that I've seen. My guess is very few people understand what Amazon was talking about enough to comment whereas almost everyone feels qualified to talk about the event itself.
 
 Lesson for crisis handlers : deep dive post-mortems that are timely, long, honestish, and highly technical are the most effective means of staunching the downward spiral of media attention.</p><p>4 0.15428151 <a title="1278-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-16-Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_in_the_Ambient_Cloud.html">750 high scalability-2009-12-16-Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud</a></p>

  Summary of the December 24, 2012 Amazon ELB Service Event in the US-East Region . A developer accidently caused some ELB data to be deleted. It's interesting to consider this  incident in the context of resiliency  and DevOps. Developers working on production, considered good, we should be full stack, models should be open, etc. Yet Amazon is responding by closing down production systems, just like the bad old days. Couldn't we have our cake and eat it too if the data was backed up and could have been restored quickly? Also,  Amazon's EC2 Outage: A Closer Look

 Quotable Quotes:                        
 
  @hackofalltrades : When positive change is only viewed through its scalability, bad things happen. 
  @faizanj : Is it time for #Netflix to move to a hybrid cloud architecture similar to Zynga zCloud? 
  @adrianco : we try not to invest in undifferentiated heavy lifting 
  @qui_oui : "scalability": a word that makes me think of how likely you are to have the ability to grow scales. 
  @Ninad_M : The question is, is #antifragile conceptually opposite of #bigdata 
  @pbailis : Batch your disk/network IO, kernel interrupts, customer package shipments -> delay arrival but increase efficiency

 Every day, Amazon Web Services adds enough new capacity to support all of Amazon.com’s global infrastructure through the company’s first 5 years, when it was $2.7 billion annual revenue. From  Cloud Computing Is Driving    Infrastructure Innovation  by James Hamilton. Where's is all that money be spent? Facilities, servers, power, and popcorn.  
  Evernote hits 10 million users . StackExchange hits  1 million users . No lawsuits expected in either case.  
  Neural waves of brain . The brain's waves drive computation, sort of, in a 5 million core, 9 Hz computer.

<p>Introduction: If a large number of leaf node machines send requests to a central root node then that root node can become overwhelmed:
  
 The CPU becomes a bottleneck, for either processing requests or sending replies, because it can't possibly deal with the flood of requests. 
 The network interface becomes a bottleneck because a wide fan-in causes TCP drops and retransmissions, which causes latency. Then clients start retrying requests which quickly causes a spiral of death in an undisciplined system. 
  
One solution to this problem is a strategy given by Dr.  Jeff Dean , Head of Google's School of Infrastructure Wizardry, in this  Stanford video presentation :  Tree Distribution of Requests and Responses .
 
 
 
Instead of having a root node connected to leaves in a flat topology, the idea is to create a tree of nodes. So a root node talks to a number of parent nodes and the parent nodes talk to a number of leaf nodes. Requests are pushed down the tree through the parents and only hit a subset</p><p>2 0.91419566 <a title="1278-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-28-The_Anatomy_of_Search_Technology%3A_Crawling_using_Combinators.html">1253 high scalability-2012-05-28-The Anatomy of Search Technology: Crawling using Combinators</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is the second guest post ( part 1 ,  part 3 ) of a series by Greg Lindahl, CTO of blekko, the spam free search engine.  Previously, Greg was Founder and Distinguished Engineer at PathScale, at which he was the architect of the InfiniPath low-latency InfiniBand HCA, used to build tightly-coupled supercomputing clusters.  
  What's so hard about crawling the web?  
Web crawlers have been around as long as the Web has -- and before the web, there were crawlers for gopher and ftp. You would think that 25 years of experience would render crawling a solved problem, but the vast growth of the web and new inventions in the technology of webspam and other unsavory content results in a constant supply of new challenges. The general difficulty of tightly-coupled parallel programming also rears its head, as the web has scaled from millions to 100s of billions of pages.
  Existing Open-Source Crawlers and Crawls

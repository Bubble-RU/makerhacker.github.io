<p>Introduction: Update 2:Velocity 09: John Allspaw, 10+ Deploys Per Day: Dev and Ops
Cooperation at Flickr. Insightful talk. Some highlights: Change is good if you
can build tools and culture to lower the risk of change. Operations and
developers need to become of one mind and respect each other. An automated
infrastructure is the one tool you need most. Common source control. One step
build. One step deploy. Don't be a pussy, deploy. Always ship trunk. Feature
flags - don't branch code, make features runtime configurable in code. Dark
launch - release data paths early without UI component. Shared metrics.
Adaptive feedback to prioritize important features. IRC for communication for
human context. Best solutions occur when dev and op work together and trust
each other. Trust is earned by helping each other solve their problems. Look
at what new features imply for operations, what can go wrong, and how to
recover. Provide knobs and levers to help operations. Devs should have access
to production machin</p><p>6 0.12396483 <a title="1235-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-06-Ask_For_Forgiveness_Programming_-_Or_How_We%27ll_Program_1000_Cores.html">1204 high scalability-2012-03-06-Ask For Forgiveness Programming - Or How We'll Program 1000 Cores</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The Twelve Networking Truths is one of a long series of timeless truths

true today.It's hard to pick a favorite because they are all good. But if I
had to pick, it would be:Some things in life can never be fully appreciated
nor understood unless experienced firsthand.As we grow comfortable behind
garden walls, clutching gadgets like lifelines and ideologies like shields,
empathy is the true social network. Network Working Group R.Callon, Editor

give this a try.That which doesn't kill your site makes it stronger. Or at
least that's the capacity planning strategy John Allspaw recommends (not
really, but I'm trying to make a point here) inThe Art of Capacity
Planning:Using production traffic to define your resources ceilings in a
controlled setting allows you to see firsthand what would happen when you run
out of capacity in a particular resource. Of course I'm not suggesting that
you run your site into the ground, but better to know what your real (not
simulated) loads are while you're watching, than find out the hard way. In
addition, a lot of unexpected systemic things can happen when load increases

<p>Introduction: I have put down my thoughts in the architecture discussed inthe blog. Although
I have done substantial research to understand how things should work before
deciding this architecture but I will be requiring huge amount of inputs from
everyone to come to an architecture decision. Hardware entities which were
thought while designing the entities are:1. Master Web Server which will map
different users to web servers placed in different geographical locations.
(will prefer storing a mapping table in RAM)2. Web Servers3. Application
Servers4. Master Database Servers (to implement entity wise look up
sharding)5. Slave Database Servers.Will really appreciate if some good inputs
of using Cloud Computing are given and how to go about it against or in
addition to the given architecture. Would like to in fact know people's view
on when to decide using cloud computing techniques. Looking forward for inputs
from the community.</p><p>5 0.91885996 <a title="1235-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-19-Paper%3A_MegaPipe%3A_A_New_Programming_Interface_for_Scalable_Network_I-O.html">1478 high scalability-2013-06-19-Paper: MegaPipe: A New Programming Interface for Scalable Network I-O</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The paper MegaPipe: A New Programming Interface for Scalable Network I/O
(video,slides) hits the common theme that if you want to go faster you need a
better car design, not just a better driver. So that's why the authors started
with a clean-slate and designed a network API from the ground up with support
for concurrent I/O, a requirement for achieving high performance while scaling
to large numbers of connections per thread, multiple cores, etc.  What they
created is MegaPipe, "a new network programming API for message-oriented
workloads to avoid the performance issues of BSD Socket API."The result:
MegaPipe outperforms baseline Linux between 29% (for long connections) and
582% (for short connections). MegaPipe improves the performance of a modiﬁed
version of memcached between 15% and 320%. For a workload based on real-world
HTTP traces, MegaPipe boosts the throughput of nginx by 75%.What's this most
excellent and interesting paper about?Message-oriented network workloads,

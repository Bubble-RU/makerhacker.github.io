<p>Introduction: One important high availability principle is concurrency control.  The idea is
to allow only that much traffic through to your system which your system can
handle successfully.  For example: if your system is certified to handle a
concurrency of 100 then the 101st request should either timeout, be asked to
try later  or wait until one of the previous 100 requests finish.  The 101st
request should not be allowed to negatively impact the experience of the other
100 users.  Only the 101st request should be impacted.Read more here...</p><p>4 0.14375421 <a title="1258-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-06-05-Cloud_Architecture_Revolution.html">1654 high scalability-2014-06-05-Cloud Architecture Revolution</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The introduction of cloud technologies is not a simple evolution of existing
ones, but a real revolution.  Like all revolutions, it changes the points of
views and redefines all the meanings. Nothing is as before.  This post wants
to analyze some key words and concepts, usually used in traditional
architectures, redefining them according the standpoint of the cloud.
Understanding the meaning of new words is crucial to grasp the essence of a
pure cloud architecture.<>THOMAS REID, Essays on the
Intellectual Powers of ManNowadays, it is required to challenge the limits of
traditional architectures that go beyond the normal concepts of scalability
and support millions of users (What's Up 500 Million) billions of transactions
per day (Salesforce 1.3 billion), five 9s of availability (99.999 AOL).  I
wish all of you the success of the examples cited above, but do not think that

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-

<p>Introduction: Complex applications coordinating work across a lot of machines often need a
highly performing fault tolerant message layer. Though a blast to write, it's
probably a better use of your time to use an off the shelf solution. And
that's whereSpreadcomes in. Flickr, for example, uses Spread to create real-
time event feeds from their web server logs. What exactly is Spread?breakFrom
theSpreadwebsite:Spread is an open source toolkit that provides a high
performance messaging service that is resilient to faults across local and
wide area networks. Spread functions as a unified message bus for distributed
applications, and provides highly tuned application-level multicast, group
communication, and point to point support. Spread services range from reliable
messaging to fully ordered messages with delivery guarantees.Spread can be
used in many distributed applications that require high reliability, high
performance, and robust communication among various subsets of members. The

<p>Introduction: Joe Armstrong is a co-inventor ofErlang and general all around renaissance
software tinkerer as shown by his excellent work on writing aC Compiler and
his voluminous work on GitHub.Given the success of Erlang it's probably no
surprise that he wrote his thesis on the ground breaking ideas behind Erlang:
Making reliable distributed systems in the presence of software errors.Even if
you have yet to join the cult of Erlang the principles behind Erlang are
universal and well worth exploring for your own designs. Highly
recommended.Introduction:How can we program systems which behave in a
reasonable manner in the presence of software errors? This is the central
question that I hope to answer in this thesis. Large systems will probably
always be delivered containing a number of errors in the software,
nevertheless such systems are expected to behave in a reasonable manner.To
make a reliable system from faulty components places certain requirements on
the system.

<p>Introduction: How do you layer a programmable Internet of smart things on top of the web?
That's the question addressed by Dominique Guinard in his ambitious
dissertation: A Web of Things Application Architecture - Integrating the Real-
World (slides). With the continued siloing of content, perhaps we can keep our
things open and talking to each other?In the architecture things are modeled
using REST, they will be findable via search, they will be social via a social
access controller, and they will be mashupable. Here's great graphical
overview of the entire system: Abstract:A central concern in the area of
pervasive computing has been the integration of digital artifactsts with the
physical world and vice-versa. Recent developments in the fi eld of embedded
devices have led to smart things increasingly populating our daily life. We de

<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting
system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by
advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide
guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see
how!Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed
in a format calledAlexandrian form which draws on constructs used by
Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:The pattern
nameThe problem the pattern is trying to solveContextSolutionExamplesDesign
rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why
experts use itPatterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context,
and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new
context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next
‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied. A pattern language is a structured
collection of such patterns that build o</p><p>2 0.96528316 <a title="1258-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-05-A_Yes_for_a_NoSQL_Taxonomy.html">737 high scalability-2009-11-05-A Yes for a NoSQL Taxonomy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In many posts, such as: The Future of the Parallelism and its Challenges I
mentioned that synchronization the access to the shared resource is the major
challenge to write parallel code.The synchronization and coordination take
long time from the overall execution time, which reduce the benefits of the
parallelism; the synchronization and coordination also reduce the
scalability.There are many forms of synchronization and coordination, such
as:Create Task object in frameworks such as: Microsoft TPL, Intel TDD, and
Parallel Runtime Library. Create and enqueue task objects require
synchronization that it's takes long time especially if we create it into
recursive work such as: Quick Sort algorithm.Synchronization the access to
shared data.But there are a few techniques to avoid these issues, such as:
Shared-Nothing, Actor Model, and Hyper Object (A.K.A. Combinable Object).
Simply if we reduce the shared data by re-architect our code this will gives
us a huge benefits in performance and s</p><p>5 0.92725438 <a title="1258-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-01-Why_is_your_network_so_slow%3F_Your_switch_should_tell_you..html">1051 high scalability-2011-06-01-Why is your network so slow?

<p>Introduction: Who hasn't cursed their network for being slow while waiting for that annoying
little hour glass of pain to release all its grains of sand? But what's really
going on? Is your network really slow? PacketPushers Show 45 - Arista - EOS
Network Software Architecture has a good explanation of what may be really at
fault (paraphrased):Network operators get calls from application guys saying
the network is slow, but the problem is usually dropped packets due to
congestion. It's not usually latency, it's usually packet loss. Packet loss
causes TCP to back off and retransmit, which causes applications to appear
slow.Packet loss can be caused by a flakey transceiver, but the problem is
usually network congestion. Somewhere on the network there's fan-in, a
bottleneck develops, queues build up to a certain point, and when a queue
overflows it drops packets. Often the first sign of this happening is
application slowness.Queues get deeper and deeper because the network is
getting more and more use</p><p>6 0.92243093 <a title="1258-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-12-Report_from_OpenSocial_Meetup_at_Google.html">183 high scalability-2007-12-12-Report from OpenSocial Meetup at Google</a></p>

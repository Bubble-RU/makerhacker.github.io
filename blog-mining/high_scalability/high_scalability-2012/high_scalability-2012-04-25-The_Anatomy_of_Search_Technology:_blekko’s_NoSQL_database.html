have been around as long as the Web has -- and before the web, there were
crawlers for gopher and ftp. You would think that 25 years of experience would
render crawling a solved problem, but the vast growth of the web and new
inventions in the technology of webspam and other unsavory content results in
a constant supply of new challenges. The general difficulty of tightly-coupled
parallel programming also rears its head, as the web has scaled from millions
to 100s of billions of pages.Existing Open-Source Crawlers and CrawlsThis

<p>Introduction: This is the third guest post (part 1,part 2) of a series by Greg Lindahl, CTO
of blekko, the spam free search engine. Previously, Greg was Founder and
Distinguished Engineer at PathScale, at which he was the architect of the
InfiniPath low-latency InfiniBand HCA, used to build tightly-coupled
supercomputing clusters.blekko's home-grown NoSQL database was designed from
the start to support a web-scale search engine, with 1,000s of servers and
petabytes of disk. Data replication is a very important part of keeping the
database up and serving queries. Like many NoSQL database authors, we decided
to keep R=3 copies of each piece of data in the database, and not use RAID to
improve reliability. The key goal we were shooting for was a database which
degrades gracefully when there are many small failures over time, without
needing human intervention.Why don't we like RAID for big NoSQL databases?Most
big storage systems use RAID levels like 3, 4, 5, or 10 to improve
reliability. A conservativ</p><p>4 0.16306683 <a title="1233-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-09-Cell_Architectures.html">1242 high scalability-2012-05-09-Cell Architectures</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A consequence of Service Oriented Architectures is the burning need to provide
services at scale. The architecture that has evolved to satisfy these
requirements is a little known technique called the Cell Architecture.A Cell
Architecture is based on the idea that massive scale requires parallelization
and parallelization requires components be isolated from each other. These
islands of isolation are called cells. A cell is a self-contained installation
that can satisfy all the operations for a shard. A shard is a subset of a much
larger dataset, typically a range of users, for example. Cell Architectures
have several advantages:Cells provide a unit of parallelization that can be
adjusted to any size as the user base grows.Cell are added in an incremental
fashion as more capacity is required.Cells isolate failures. One cell failure
does not impact other cells.Cells provide isolation as the storage and
application horsepower to process requests is independent of other cells.Cells

<p>Introduction: Update 2:Sorting 1 PB with MapReduce. PB is not peanut-butter-and-jelly
misspelled. It's 1 petabyte or 1000 terabytes or 1,000,000 gigabytes.It took
six hours and two minutes to sort 1PB (10 trillion 100-byte records) on 4,000
computersand the results were replicated thrice on 48,000 disks.Update:Greg
Lindenpoints to a new Google articleMapReduce: simplified data processing on
large clusters. Some interesting stats: 100k MapReduce jobs are executed each
day; more than 20 petabytes of data are processed per day; more than 10k
MapReduce programs have been implemented; machines are dual processor with
gigabit ethernet and 4-8 GB of memory.Google is the King of scalability.
Everyone knows Google for their large, sophisticated, and fast searching, but
they don't just shine in search. Their platform approach to building scalable
applications allows them to roll out internet scale applications at an
alarmingly high competition crushing rate. Their goal is always to build a

<p>Introduction: This is an interview with Gabriel Weinberg, founder of Duck Duck Go and
general all around startup guru, on what DDG's architecture looks like in
2012.Innovative search engine upstart DuckDuckGo had30 million searchesin
February 2012 and averages over 1 million searches a day. It's being
positioned bysuper investor Fred Wilsonas a clean, private, impartial and fast
search engine. After talking with Gabriel I like what Fred Wilson said
earlier, it seems closer to the heart of the matter:We invested in DuckDuckGo
for the Reddit, Hacker News anarchists.                  Choosing DuckDuckGo
can be thought of as not just a technical choice, but a vote for revolution.
In an age when knowing your essence is not about about love or friendship, but
about more effectively selling you to advertisers, DDG is positioning
themselves as thedo not track alternative, keepers of theprivacy flame. You
will still be monetized of course, but in a more civilized and anonymous way.

every column i can't determine no of results.I need to compare for each and
every column.This query is very frequent .How can i approach for this
problem.What type of architecture,tools is helpful.I just know that this can
be accomplished with distributed system but how can i make this system. I also

<p>Introduction: How does the Wayback Machinework? Now with over 400 billion webpages indexed,
allowing the Internet to be browsed all the way back to 1996, it's an even
more compelling question. I've looked several times but I've never found a
really good answer.Here's some information from a thread on Hacker News. It
starts with mmagin, a former Archive employee:I can't speak to their current
infrastructure (though more of it is open source now - http://archive-
access.sourceforge.net/projects/wayback/ ), but as far as the wayback machine,
there was no SQL database anywhere in it.For the purposes of making the
wayback machine go:Archived data was in ARC file format (predecessor to
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_ARChive) which is essentially a concatenation
of separately gzipped records. That is, you can seek to a particular offset
and start decompressing a record. Thus you could get at any archived web page
with a triple (server, filename, file-offset) Thus it was spread across a lot

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post (part 2,part 3) by Greg Lindahl, CTO of blekko, the spam
free search engine that had over 3.5 million unique visitors in March. Greg
Lindahl was Founder and Distinguished Engineer at PathScale, at which he was
the architect of the InfiniPath low-latency InfiniBand HCA, used to build
tightly-coupled supercomputing clusters.Imagine that you're crazy enough to
think about building a search engine.  It's a huge task: the minimum index
size needed to answer most queries is a few billion webpages. Crawling and
indexing a few billion webpages requires a cluster with several petabytes of
usable disk -- that's several thousand 1 terabyte disks -- and produces an
index that's about 100 terabytes in size.Serving query results quickly
involves having most of the index in RAM or on solid state (flash) disk. If
you can buy a server with 100 gigabytes of RAM for about $3,000, that's 1,000
servers at a capital cost of $3 million, plus about $1 million per year of
server co-locatio</p><p>2 0.96249431 <a title="1233-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-01-Myth%3A_Eric_Brewer_on_Why_Banks_are_BASE_Not_ACID_-_Availability_Is_Revenue_.html">1450 high scalability-2013-05-01-Myth: Eric Brewer on Why Banks are BASE Not ACID - Availability Is Revenue </a></p>
<p>Introduction: InNoSQL: Past, Present, FutureEric Brewerhas a particularly fine section on
explaining the often hard to understand ideas ofBASE(Basically Available, Soft
State, Eventually Consistent),ACID(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation,
Durability),CAP(Consistency Availability, Partition Tolerance), in terms of a
pernicious long standing myth about the sanctity of consistency in
banking.Myth: Money is important, so banksmustuse transactions to keep money
safe and consistent, right?Reality: Banking transactions are inconsistent,
particularly for ATMs. ATMs are designed to have a normal case behaviour and a
partition mode behaviour. In partition mode Availability is chosen over
Consistency.Why?1)Availability correlates with revenue and consistency
generally does not.2)Historically there was never an idea of perfect
communication so everything was partitioned.Your ATM transaction must go
through so Availability is more important than consistency. If the ATM is down
then you aren't making money.

<p>Introduction: A lot of apps need to map IP addresses to locations. Jeremy Cole inOn
efficiently geo-referencing IPs with MaxMind GeoIP and MySQL GISsuccinctly
explains the many uses for such a feature:Geo-referencing IPs is, in a
nutshell, converting an IP address, perhaps from an incoming web visitor, a
log file, a data file, or some other place, into the name of some entity
owning that IP address. There are a lot of reasons you may want to geo-
reference IP addresses to country, city, etc., such as in simple ad targeting
systems, geographic load balancing, web analytics, and many more
applications.This is difficult to do efficiently, at least it gives me a bit
of brain freeze. In the same post Jeremy nicely explains where to get the geo-
rereferncing data, how to load data, and the performance of different
approaches for IP address searching. It's a great practical introduction to
the subject.</p><p>5 0.95565057 <a title="1233-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-04-Product%3A_Cacti.html">58 high scalability-2007-08-04-Product: Cacti</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cactiis a network statistics graphing tool designed as a frontend to RRDtool's
data storage and graphing functionality. It is intended to be intuitive and
easy to use, as well as robust and scalable. It is generally used to graph
time-series data like CPU load and bandwidth use.The frontend is written in
PHP; it can handle multiple users, each with their own graph sets, so it is
sometimes used by web hosting providers (especially dedicated server, virtual
private server, and colocation providers) to display bandwidth statistics for
their customers. It can be used to configure the data collection itself,
allowing certain setups to be monitored without any manual configuration of
RRDtool.</p><p>6 0.95422852 <a title="1233-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-24-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_24%2C_2012.html">1198 high scalability-2012-02-24-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 24, 2012</a></p>

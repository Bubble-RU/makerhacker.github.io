<p>Introduction: In  Secrets to Lightning Fast Mobile Design , Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger shares three strategies Instagram uses to outsmart high latency mobile networks and make mobile apps feel faster than they really are, which helped Instagram reach 12 million users in 12 months:
  
  The motivation:  "mobile experiences fill gaps while we wait. no one wants to wait while they wait" 
  Perform actions optimistically . Make the user feel productive. Likes, comments, and follows are registered on screen while the like operation is being sent in the background.  
  Adaptively preload content . Load content before it's needed. Don't images according to time, it will take too long, instead re-prioritize based on interest. Show what the social network things is the most popular. Listen to what your user's flicks and taps are telling you. 
  Move bits when no-one is watching.  Picture uploading starts  before  you share them, most apps wait until after the share screen. The rule is send data as soo</p><p>5 0.19289829 <a title="1224-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-21-Pixable_Architecture_-_Crawling%2C_Analyzing%2C_and_Ranking_20_Million_Photos_a_Day.html">1197 high scalability-2012-02-21-Pixable Architecture - Crawling, Analyzing, and Ranking 20 Million Photos a Day</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Alberto Lopez Toledo, PHD, CTO of Pixable, and Julio Viera, VP of Engineering at Pixable. 
 
   Pixable  aggregates photos from across your different social networks and finds the best ones so you never miss an important moment. That means currently processing the metadata of more than 20 million new photos per day: crawling, analyzing, ranking, and sorting them along with the other 5+ billion that are already stored in our database. Making sense of all that data has challenges, but two in particular rise above the rest:
  
 How to access millions of photos per day from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other services in the most efficient manner. 
 How to process, organize, index, and store all the meta-data related to those photos. 
  
Sure, Pixable’s infrastructure is changing continuously, but there are some things that we have learned over the last year. As a result, we have been able to build a scalable infrastructure that takes advantage of today’s tools,</p><p>6 0.17981161 <a title="1224-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-13-Flickr_Architecture.html">152 high scalability-2007-11-13-Flickr Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There has been an update on Pinterest:  Pinterest growth driven by Amazon cloud scalability  since our last post:  A Short on the Pinterest Stack for Handling 3+ Million Users .
 
With Pinterest we see a story very similar to that of  Instagram . Huge growth, lots of users, lots of data, with remarkably few employees, all on the cloud.
 
While it's true that both Pinterest and Instagram are not making great advances in  science and technology , that is more indicator of the easy power of today's commodity environments rather than a sign of Silicon Valley's lack of innovation. The numbers are so huge and the valuations are so high we naturally want some sort of fundamental technological revolution to underlie their growth. The revolution is more subtle. It really is just that easy to attain such growth these days, if you can execute on the right idea. Get used to it. This is the new normal.
 
Here's what Pinterest looks like today:

Instagram uses a pastiche of different technologies and strategies.

<p>Introduction: It's been a well kept secret, but you may have heard  Facebook will Buy Photo-Sharing Service Instagram for $1 Billion . Just what is Facebook buying? Here's a quick gloss I did a little over a year ago on a presentation Instagram gave on their architecture. In that article I called Instagram's architecture the " canonical description of an early stage startup in this era." Little did we know how true that would turn out to be. If you want to learn how they did it then don't take a picture, just keep on reading...

<p>Introduction: Hibernate and iBATIS and other similar tools have documentation with recommendations for avoiding the "N+1 select" problem.  The problem being that if you wanted to retrieve a set of widgets from a table, one query would be used to to retrieve all the ids of the matching widgets (select widget_id from widget where ...) and then for each id, another select is used to retrieve the details of that widget (select * from widget where widget_id = ?).  If you have 100 widgets, it requires 101 queries to get the details of them all.     I can see why this is bad, but what if you're doing entity caching?  i.e. If you run the first query to get your list of ids, and then for each widget you retrive it from the cache.  Surely in that case, N+1(+caching) is good?  Assuming of course that there is a high probability of all of the matching entities being in the cache.     I may be asking a daft question here - one whose answer is obviously implied by the large scalable mechanisms for storing data th</p><p>4 0.81120735 <a title="1224-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-25-Learn_how_to_manage_change_and_complexity_by_Zachman_Live..html">522 high scalability-2009-02-25-Learn how to manage change and complexity by Zachman Live.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post about how boring and repetitive HA and scalability problems can be solved via Open Source so you can focus on the interesting tasks. The post was written by  Maarten Ectors , responsible for Cloud Strategy and  Frank Mueller , a Juju Core developer, at  Ubuntu / Canonical . 
 
High-availability and scalability are exciting in general but there are certain problems that experts see over and over again. The list is long but examples are setting up MySQL clustering, sharding Mongo, adding data nodes to a Hadoop cluster, monitoring with Ganglia, building continuous deployment solutions, integrating Memcached / Varnish / Nginx,… Why are we reinventing the wheel?
 
At Ubuntu we made it our goal to have the community solve these repetitive and often boring tasks. How often have you had to set-up MySQL replication and scale it? What if the next time you just simply do:

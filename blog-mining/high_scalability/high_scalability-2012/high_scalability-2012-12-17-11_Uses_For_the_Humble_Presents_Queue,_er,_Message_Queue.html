<p>Introduction: There's not a lot  of talk about application architectures at the process level. You have your threads, pools of threads, and you have your callback models. That's about it. Languages/frameworks making a virtue out of simple models, like Go and Erlang, do so at the price of control. It's difficult to make a low latency well conditioned application when a power full tool, like work scheduling, is taken out of the hands of the programmer.
 
But that's not all there is my friend. We'll dive into different ways an application can be composed across threads of control.
 
Your favorite language may not give you access to all the capabilities we are going to talk about, but lately there has been a sort of revival in considering performance important, especially for controlling  latency variance , so I think it's time to talk about these kind of issues.

<p>Introduction: Hidden in every computer is a hardware backplane for moving signals around. Hidden in every application are ways of moving messages around and giving code CPU time to process them. Unhiding those capabilities and making them first class facilities for the programmer to control is the idea behind AppBackplane.
 
This goes directly against the trend of hiding everything from the programmer and doing it all automagically. Which is great, until it doesn't work. Then it sucks. And the approach of giving the programmer all the power also sucks, until it's tuned to work together and performance is incredible even under increasing loads. Then it's great.
 
These are two different curves going in opposite directions. You need to decide for your application which curve you need to be on.

How do you structure your application? That’s the question I explored in the article  Beyond Threads And Callbacks . An option I did not talk about, mostly because of my own ignorance, is a powerful stack you may not be all that familiar with: Scala and Akka.
   To remedy my oversight is our acting tour guide, Typesafe’s Viktor Klang, long time Scala hacker and Java enterprise systems architect. Viktor was very patient in answering my questions and was enthusiastic about sharing his knowledge. He’s a guy who definitely knows what he is talking about. 
   I’ve implemented several Actor systems along with the messaging infrastructure, threading, async IO, service orchestration, failover, etc, so I’m innately skeptical about frameworks that remove control from the programmer at</p><p>6 0.70511544 <a title="1373-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-06-Low_Level_Scalability_Solutions_-_The_Aggregation_Collection.html">1418 high scalability-2013-03-06-Low Level Scalability Solutions - The Aggregation Collection</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In the article  The  Onion Uses Django, And Why It Matters To Us , a lot of interesting points are made about their ambitious infrastructure move from Drupal/PHP to Django/Python: the move wasn't that hard, it just took time and work because of their previous experience moving the A.V. Club website; churn in core framework APIs make it more attractive to move than stay; supporting the structure of older versions of the site is an unsolved problem; the built-in Django admin saved a lot of work; group development is easier with "fewer specialized or hacked together pieces"; they use IRC for distributed development; sphinx for full-text search; nginx is the media server and reverse proxy; haproxy made the launch process a 5  second procedure; capistrano for deployment; clean component separation makes moving easier; Git for version control; ORM with complicated querysets is a performance problem; memcached for caching rendered pages; the CDN checks for updates every 10 minutes; videos, ar</p><p>same-blog 2 0.93324292 <a title="1373-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-17-11_Uses_For_the_Humble_Presents_Queue%2C_er%2C_Message_Queue.html">1373 high scalability-2012-12-17-11 Uses For the Humble Presents Queue, er, Message Queue</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a little known fact that Santa Clause was an early queue innovator. Faced with the problem of delivering a planet full of presents in one night, Santa, in his hacker's workshop, created a Present Distribution System using thousands of region based priority present queues for continuous delivery by the Rudolphs. Rudolphs? You didn't think there was only one Rudolph did you? Presents are delivered in parallel by a cluster of sleighs, each with redundant reindeer in a master-master configuration. Each Rudolph is a cluster leader and they coordinate work using an early and more magical version of the ZooKeeper protocol.
 
Programmers have followed Santa's lead and you can find a  message queue  in nearly every major architecture profile on  HighScalability . Historically they may have been introduced after a first generation architecture needed to scale up from their two tier system into something a little more capable (asynchronicity, work dispatch, load buffering, database offloadin</p><p>3 0.93107474 <a title="1373-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-02-Strategy%3A_Use_Spare_Region_Capacity_to_Survive_Availability_Zone_Failures.html">1296 high scalability-2012-08-02-Strategy: Use Spare Region Capacity to Survive Availability Zone Failures</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the wake of the recent Amazon problems  Ryan Lackey  offers some practical first responder cloud survival advice:
  If you're a large site (particularly a PaaS) on AWS and care about availability, you need to have spare capacity in your region (using Reserve Instances, like Netflix does) to cover when a single AZ disappears, and your own external to AWS load balancing (not DNS based), with your own per-AZ subsidiary load balancers (nginx or whatever) running within EC2.   You need a robust database layer, ideally multi-region or AWS + nonAWS, but that's more site specific.     Going multiregion is the next step, and the above is an essential part of getting to that point.</p><p>4 0.92752415 <a title="1373-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-30-The_AOL_XMPP_scalability_challenge.html">234 high scalability-2008-01-30-The AOL XMPP scalability challenge</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We're back and it's HighScalability Time:
  
  1B Tweets Every 2.5 Days : Twitter.  1 billion transactions/day : Salesforce.  
 Storing  700 terabytes of data into a single gram of DNA . Downside, reading  is very slow . And any data might conflict with the messages aliens have already inserted. 
 Assuming my infonome is 1 TB, it would cost $1,338,333 to store my existence in Amazon Glacier for a long nowish 10,000 years. #notbad

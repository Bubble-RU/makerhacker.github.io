Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are
already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.We're basically using
a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and
topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on
Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store
to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget).
Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text,
author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.I'm wondering if
we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store
the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback
here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to
retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just
post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to get the r</p><p>3 0.1634842 <a title="1340-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-06-11_Common_Web_Use_Cases_Solved_in_Redis.html">1074 high scalability-2011-07-06-11 Common Web Use Cases Solved in Redis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In How to take advantage of Redis just adding it to your stack Salvatore
'antirez' Sanfilippo shows how to solve some common problems in Redis by
taking advantage of its unique data structure handling capabilities. Common
Redis primitives like LPUSH, and LTRIM, and LREM are used to accomplish tasks
programmers need to get done, but that can be hard or slow in more traditional
stores. A very useful and practical article. How would you accomplish these
tasks in your framework?Show latest items listings in your home page. This is
a live in-memory cache and is very fast.LPUSHis used to insert a content ID at
the head of the list stored at a key.LTRIMis used to limit the number of items
in the list to 5000. If the user needs to page beyond this cache only then are
they sent to the database.Deletion and filtering. If a cached article is
deleted it can be removed from the cache using LREM.Leaderboards and related
problems. A leader board is a set sorted by score. TheZADDcommands implements

<p>Introduction: Update: Here's thevideo of the talk.Erick Pickup, lead developer at
YouPorn.com, presented their architecture in a talk titledBuilding a Website
To Scalegiven at theConFooconference.  As you might expect, YouPorn is a
beast, streaming three full DVDs of video every second, handing 300K queries
every second, and generating up to 15GBs of log data per hour.Unfortunately,
all we have are the slides of the talk, so this article isn't as technical as
I might like, there's no visibility at all on the video handling for example,
but we do get some interesting details.The most interesting takeway is that
YouPorn is a pretty conventional LAMP stack, with a NoSQL twist as Redis now
replaces MySQL in the live datapath. Reminds me a little ofYouTubein its
simplicity.The second most interesting takeaway was thegreat switchover.
Common wisdom says never rewrite, but in 2011 YouPorn rewrote their entire
site to use PHP + Redis instead of a complex Perl + MySQL based architecture.

<p>Introduction: With the introduction ofRedisyour options in the key-value space just grew and
your choice of which to pick just got a lot harder. But when you think about
it, that's not a bad position to be in at all.Redis (REmote DIctionary Server)
-a key-value database. It's similar to memcached but the dataset is not
volatile, and values can be strings, exactly like in memcached, but also lists
and sets with atomic operations to push/pop elements.The key points are: open
source; speed (benchmarked performing 110,000 SET operations, and 81,000 GETs,
per second); persistence, but in an asynchronous way taking everything in
memory; support for higher level data structures and atomic operations.The
home page is well organized so I'll spare the excessive-copying-to-make-this-
post-longer. For a good overview of Redis take a look at Antonio Cangiano's
article:Introducing Redis: a fast key-value database.If you are looking at a
way to understand how Redis is different than something like Tokyo

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ben Lowry, CEO ofPlaytomic. Playtomic is a game
analytics service implemented in about 8000 mobile, web and downloadable games
played by approximately 20 million people daily.Here's a good summary quote by
Ben Lowry on Hacker News:Just over 20,000,000 people hit my API yesterday
700,749,252 times, playing the ~8,000 games my analytics platform is
integrated in for a bit under 600 years in total play time. That's just
yesterday. There are lots of different bottlenecks waiting for people
operating at scale. Heroku and NodeJS, for my use case, eventually alleviated
a whole bunch of them very cheaply.Playtomic began with an almost exclusively
Microsoft.NET and Windows architecture which held up for 3 years before being
replaced with a complete rewrite using NodeJS.  During its lifetime the entire

<p>Introduction: In How to take advantage of Redis just adding it to your stack Salvatore
'antirez' Sanfilippo shows how to solve some common problems in Redis by
taking advantage of its unique data structure handling capabilities. Common
Redis primitives like LPUSH, and LTRIM, and LREM are used to accomplish tasks
programmers need to get done, but that can be hard or slow in more traditional
stores. A very useful and practical article. How would you accomplish these
tasks in your framework?Show latest items listings in your home page. This is
a live in-memory cache and is very fast.LPUSHis used to insert a content ID at
the head of the list stored at a key.LTRIMis used to limit the number of items
in the list to 5000. If the user needs to page beyond this cache only then are
they sent to the database.Deletion and filtering. If a cached article is
deleted it can be removed from the cache using LREM.Leaderboards and related

Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are
already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.We're basically using
a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and
topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on
Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store
to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget).
Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text,
author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.I'm wondering if
we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store
the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback
here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to
retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just
post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to get the r</p><p>5 0.72832203 <a title="1340-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-28-Design_Decisions_for_Scaling_Your_High_Traffic_Feeds.html">1538 high scalability-2013-10-28-Design Decisions for Scaling Your High Traffic Feeds</a></p>

@tschellenbach on Twitter and GithubFashiolistastarted out as a hobby project
which we built on the side. We had absolutely no idea it would grow into one
of the largest online fashion communities. The entire first version took about
two weeks to develop and our feed implementation was dead simple. We've come a
long way since then and I'd like to share our experience with scaling feed
systems.Feeds are a core component of many large startups such as Pinterest,
Instagram, Wanelo and Fashiolista. At Fashiolista the feed system powers
theflat feed,aggregated feedand thenotification system. This article will
explain the troubles we ran into when scaling our feeds and the design
decisions involved with building your own solution. Understanding the basics
of how these feed systems work is essential as more and more applications rely
on them.Furthermore we've open sourcedFeedly, the Python module powering our

<p>Introduction: i didnt find a nearly good solution for this problem yet:imagine, you're
responsible for a small CDN network (static images), with two different
datacenter. the balancing for the two DC is done with a anycast nameservice (a
nameserver in every DC, user gets on nearest location). so, one of the
scenario is that one of the datacenters goes down completly. you can do a
monitoring on the nameserver and only route to the dc which is still alive, no
problem. But what about the TTL from the DNS-Records? Tiny TTLs like 2 min.
are often ignored by several ISP (e.g. AOL). so, the client doesn't get the IP
from the other Datacenter. what could be a solution in this scenario?</p><p>same-blog 2 0.84290612 <a title="1340-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-15-Simpler%2C_Cheaper%2C_Faster%3A_Playtomic%27s_Move_from_.NET_to_Node_and_Heroku.html">1340 high scalability-2012-10-15-Simpler, Cheaper, Faster: Playtomic's Move from .NET to Node and Heroku</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ben Lowry, CEO ofPlaytomic. Playtomic is a game
analytics service implemented in about 8000 mobile, web and downloadable games
played by approximately 20 million people daily.Here's a good summary quote by
Ben Lowry on Hacker News:Just over 20,000,000 people hit my API yesterday
700,749,252 times, playing the ~8,000 games my analytics platform is
integrated in for a bit under 600 years in total play time. That's just
yesterday. There are lots of different bottlenecks waiting for people
operating at scale. Heroku and NodeJS, for my use case, eventually alleviated
a whole bunch of them very cheaply.Playtomic began with an almost exclusively
Microsoft.NET and Windows architecture which held up for 3 years before being
replaced with a complete rewrite using NodeJS.  During its lifetime the entire
platform grew from shared space on a single server to a full dedicated, then

<p>Introduction: One stumbling block of the the great march towards virtualization is the
relatively poor performance of resource hungry applications like databases. We
are told to develop and test using VMs, but deploy without them. Which kind of
sucks IMHO. Maybe better virtualization technology can remove this split. This
paper talks about a different approach to virtualization called "container-
based" virtualization that can reportedly double the performance of
traditional hypervisor systems like Xen. It does this by trading isolation for
efficiency. Rather than maintaining complete isolation between VMs the
container approach shares resources between VMs and thus gives higher
performance while still guaranteeing strong fault, resource, and security
isolation. It's yet another battle in computing's endless war of creating and
destroying abstraction layers. I learned a lot from from this paper because of
how it compared and contrasted traditional hypervisor and container based
virtualization strate</p><p>5 0.75657177 <a title="1340-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-19-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_March_19%2C_2010.html">797 high scalability-2010-03-19-Hot Scalability Links for March 19, 2010</a></p>

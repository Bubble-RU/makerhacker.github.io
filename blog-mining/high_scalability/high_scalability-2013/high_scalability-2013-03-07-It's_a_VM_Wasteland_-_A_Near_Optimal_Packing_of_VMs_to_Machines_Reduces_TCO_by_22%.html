GigaSpaces XAP, Scalr, RightScale and FreedomOSS can be used to handle peak

inDissecting today's surgeshow the nature of internet traffic has evolved over

<p>Introduction: In the more cool stuff I've never heard of before department is something
calledSelf Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance(SCIT).Botnetsare created when
vulnerable computers live long enough to become infected with the will to do
the evil bidding of their evil masters. Security is almost always about
removing vulnerabilities (a process which to outside observers often looks
like adog chasing its tail). SCIT takes a different approach, it works on the
availability angle. Something I never thought of before, but which makes a
great deal of sense once I thought about it.With SCIT you stop and restart VM
instances every minute (or whatever depending in your desired window
vulnerability)....breakThis short exposure window means worms and viri do not
have long enough to fully infect a machine and carry out a coordinated attack.
A machine is up for a while. Does work. And then is torn down again only to be
reborn as a clean VM with no possibility of infection (unless of course the VM

<p>Introduction: Update 2: Rumor no more.Google Jumps Head First Into Web Services With Google
App Engine. The quick and dirty of it: developers simply upload their Python
code to Google, launch the application, and can monitor usage and other
metrics via a multi-platform desktop application. There were 10,000 developer
slots open and of course I was too late. More as the cobra strikes.Update:
TechCrunch reportsGoogle To Launch BigTable As Web Servicenext week. It
competes with Amazon's SimpleDB. Though it won't be truly comparable until
they also release an EC2 and S3 equivalent. An internet hit for each data

don't take no sh*t from nobody. "FirstDave Winerhallucinates a pig on the mean

<p>Introduction: Mind the Gap: Reconnecting Architecture and OS Research is a paper presented
atHotOS XIII, the place where researchers talk about making potential futures
happen. For a great overview of the conference take a look at this article by
Matt Welsh: Conference report: HotOS 2011 in Napa.In the VM/cloud age I
question the need of having an OS at all, programs can compile directly
against "raw" hardware, but the paper does a good job of trying to figure out
the new roll operating systems can play in the future. We've been in a long OS
holding pattern, so long that we've seen the rise of PaaS vendors skipping the
OS level abstraction completely, but there's room for a middle ground between
legacy time sharing systems of the past and service level APIs that are but
one possible future.Introduction:For too long, operating systems researchers
and developers have pretty much taken whatever computer architects have dished
out.

<p>Introduction: In the scalability is specialization department here is an interesting paper
presented atHotNets '13on high performance networking: Network Stack
Specialization for Performance.The idea is generalizing a service so it fits
in the kernel comes at a high performance cost. So move TCP into user space.
The result is a web server with ~3.5x the throughput of Nginx "while
experiencing low CPU utilization, linear scaling on multicore systems, and
saturating current NIC hardware."Here's a good description of the paper
publishedon Layer 9:Traditionally, servers and OSes have been built to be
general purpose. However now we have a high degree of specialization. In fact,
in a big web service, you might have thousands of machines dedicated to one
function. Therefore, there's scope for specialization. This paper looks at a
specific opportunity in that space. Network stacks today are good for high
throughput with large transfers, but not small files (which are common in web

<p>Introduction: After poking around theGoogle Compute Engine(GCE) documentation I had some
trouble creating a mental model of how GCE works. Is it like AWS, GAE,
Rackspace, just what is it? After watchingGoogle I/O 2012 - Introducing Google
Compute EngineandGoogle Compute Engine -- Technical Details, it turns out my
initial impression, that GCE is disarmingly straightforward, turns out to be
the point.The focus of GCE is on the C, which stands for Compute, and that's
what GCE is all about: deploying lots of servers to solve computationally hard
problems. What you get with GCE is a Super Datacenter on Google Steroids.If
you are wondering how you will run the next Instagram on GCE then that would
be missing the point. GAE is targeted at applications. GCE is targeted
at:Delivering a proven, pure, high performance, high scale compute
infrastructure using a utility pricing model, on top of an open, secure,
extensible Infrastructure-as-a-Service.Delivering an experience that feels

<p>Introduction: In Algorithm Design for Performance Aware VM Consolidation we learn some
shocking facts (gambling in Casablanca?):Average server utilization in many
data centers is low, estimated between 5% and 15%. This is wasteful because an
idle server often consumes more than 50% of peak power.Surely that's just for
old style datacenters? Nope. In Google data centers, workloads that are
consolidated use only 50% of the processor cores. Every other processor core
is left unused simply to ensure that performance does not degrade.It's a VM
wasteland. The goal is to reduce waste by packing VMs onto machines without
hurting performance or wasting resources. The idea is to select VMs that
interfere the least with each other and places them together on the same
server.It's a NP-Complete problem, but this paper describes a practical method
that performs provably close to the optimal. Interestingly they can optimize
for performance or power efficiency, so you can use different algorithms for
different work</p><p>4 0.8577897 <a title="1419-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-17-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_July_17%2C_2010.html">860 high scalability-2010-07-17-Hot Scalability Links for July 17, 2010</a></p>

Crawler Czar? Tom Foremski has the idea thatGoogle should open up their
indexso sites wouldn't have to endure the constant pounding by ravenous
crawler bots. Don MacAskill of SmugMug estimates50% of our web server CPU
resourcesare spent serving crawlers. What a waste. How this would all work
with real-time feeds, paid  feeds (Twitter, movies, ...), etc. is unknown, but
does it make sense for all that money to be spent on extracting the same data

<p>Introduction: If you don't cannibalize yourself, someone else will. --Steve Jobs  America as
the New World has a long history of inspiring Utopian communities. Early
experiments were famously religious. But there have been many others as new
waves of thought have inspired people to organize and try something
different.In the 1840s Transcendentalists, believing the true path lay in the
perfection of the individual, created intentional communities likeBrook Farm.
We've also seensocialist, anarchist,hippy, and virtually every other kind of
Utopia in-between. Psychologist B.F. Skinner wrote an infamous book,Walden
Two, with a more "scientific" take on creating a Utopian community and Ayn
Rand inAtlas Shrugged had her free market version.I believe in startup
organizations we see the modern version of Utopian energy in action. We now
call it by names like "culture hacking", but the goal is the same: to create a
new form of human community to achieve a profound goal. You may think startups
are only about m</p><p>6 0.82724196 <a title="1419-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-27-Should_Twitter_be_an_All-You-Can-Eat_Buffet_or_a_Vending_Machine%3F.html">330 high scalability-2008-05-27-Should Twitter be an All-You-Can-Eat Buffet or a Vending Machine?</a></p>

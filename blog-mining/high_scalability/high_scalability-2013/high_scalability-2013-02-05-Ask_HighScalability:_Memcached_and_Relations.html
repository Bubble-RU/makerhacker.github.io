I'm wondering what you would do: I develop a webapp using Grails, Memcached and Mysql as persistence. Now, I have following domain classes (simplified):
 
 Product : Can be in one category  Category : Can have nested children, and have multiple products.
 
I need to access all product objects by id which led me to the idea to store all products in one big Memcached-entry with a key: PRODUCTMAP and as value, all product attributes as array, like: [productId1: [title: 'title'], productId2: [title: 'title']]
 
If I browse to category 4, I simply get my map categoryMap with value [cateoryId: [productId1, productId2]] I also can list all products of a certain category by providing that id. 
 
The bad thing about this is that I always have to put back everything if I modify a single product.
 
Who can give advice how to realize that? Any help will be appreciated!

<p>Introduction: Justin.tv is looking to hire a   Scaling Engineer   to  help scale their video cluster, IRC server, web app, monitoring and search services. I've never seen this job title before. A  quick search that showed only a few previous instances of it being used. Has anyone else seen Scaling Engineer as a job title before?      It's a great idea. Scaling is certainly a worthy specialty of it's own. Why there's a difficult lingo, obscure tools, endlessly subtle concepts, a massive body of knowledge to master, and many competing religious factions. All a good start. Next I see a chain of Scalability Universities. Maybe use all those Starbucks that are closing down.

<p>Introduction: Hi all,     Has anyone got any experience with using Amazon S3 as an uploaded photo store?      I'm writing a website that I need to keep as low budget as possible, and I'm investigating solutions for storing uploaded photos from users - not too many, probably in the low thousands. The site is commercial so I'm straying away from the Flickrs of the world. S3 seems to offer a solution but I'd like to hear from those who have used it before.

<p>Introduction: Hibernate and iBATIS and other similar tools have documentation with recommendations for avoiding the "N+1 select" problem.  The problem being that if you wanted to retrieve a set of widgets from a table, one query would be used to to retrieve all the ids of the matching widgets (select widget_id from widget where ...) and then for each id, another select is used to retrieve the details of that widget (select * from widget where widget_id = ?).  If you have 100 widgets, it requires 101 queries to get the details of them all.     I can see why this is bad, but what if you're doing entity caching?  i.e. If you run the first query to get your list of ids, and then for each widget you retrive it from the cache.  Surely in that case, N+1(+caching) is good?  Assuming of course that there is a high probability of all of the matching entities being in the cache.     I may be asking a daft question here - one whose answer is obviously implied by the large scalable mechanisms for storing data th</p><p>4 0.60675395 <a title="1399-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-30-Creating_a_high-performing_online_database_.html">451 high scalability-2008-11-30-Creating a high-performing online database </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi there,      I have an idea for an online database that services a large number of people. I've been studying it for a while and it seems feasible to me to create it and get people to populate it. It will need time to grow but eventually it will get there.      The model I'm looking at is IMDB, the depth of information is fascinating, yet it's fast, not so easy to use though, but it's pretty usable!      What do you think I need to create a database an online database like IMDB. I know that IMDB power comes from it's information, not the design of the site. This is something I kind of figured out.      But what I need to know is the best tools to publish database contents on the web, retrieve it in that fast way like IMDB. I'm sure that I will need to create data entry logs for my users to populate the database.      What programming languages you suggest? development environment? approaches?      your contribution is highly appreciated.

<p>Introduction: Hi everyone, I'm researching on Scalability for a college paper, and found this site great, but it has too many tips, articles and the like, but I can't see a hierarchical organization of subjects, I would need something like a checklist of things or fields, or technologies to take into account when assesing scalability.     So far I've identified these:     - Hardware scalability:    - scale out    - scale up     - Cache    What types of cache are there? app-level, os-level, network-level, I/O-level?   - Load Balancing   - DB Clustering     Am I missing something important? (I'm sure I am)   I don't expect you to give a lecture here, but maybe point some things out, give me some useful links...

<p>Introduction: Hi Friends,  I need some help in making site access fast. On an average my site has the traffic 2500 hits per day and on 16th May it had 60,000 hits. On this day site was loading very slow even it was getting time out. I also check out the processes running by using "top" command it was indicating mysql was taking too much load.  There are around 166 tables (Including PHPBB forum) in my database. All contents on site are displayed by fetching it from database. I have also added indexing to respective tables where it is required. Plain PHP/HTML coding is used.  Technology:  PHP -- 5.2 MYSQL -- 5.0 Apache -- 2.0 Linux  Following is all the server details of my site:   CPU :  Single Socket Dual Core AMD Opteron 1212HE Memory: 2GB DDR RAM Hard Drive: 250GB SATA Ethernet: 100Mb Primary Ethernet Card  (/var/log) # uname -a Linux 2.6.9-67.0.15.ELsmp #1 SMP Tue Apr 22 13:50:33 EDT 2008 i686 athlon i386 GNU/Linux  kernel version: 2.6.9-67.0.15.ELsmp  (/var/log) # free -m  total       used</p><p>same-blog 2 0.87166512 <a title="1399-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-05-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Memcached_and_Relations.html">1399 high scalability-2013-02-05-Ask HighScalability: Memcached and Relations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi everybody
 
I'm wondering what you would do: I develop a webapp using Grails, Memcached and Mysql as persistence. Now, I have following domain classes (simplified):
 
 Product : Can be in one category  Category : Can have nested children, and have multiple products.
 
I need to access all product objects by id which led me to the idea to store all products in one big Memcached-entry with a key: PRODUCTMAP and as value, all product attributes as array, like: [productId1: [title: 'title'], productId2: [title: 'title']]
 
If I browse to category 4, I simply get my map categoryMap with value [cateoryId: [productId1, productId2]] I also can list all products of a certain category by providing that id. 
 
The bad thing about this is that I always have to put back everything if I modify a single product.
 
Who can give advice how to realize that? Any help will be appreciated! 
 
Thanks,
 
Best Sullivan</p><p>3 0.86931062 <a title="1399-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-17-Scaling_in_Games_%26_Virtual_Worlds___.html">496 high scalability-2009-01-17-Scaling in Games & Virtual Worlds   </a></p>
<p>Introduction: "Online games and virtual worlds have familiar scaling requirements, but don’t be fooled: everything you know is wrong." Jim Waldo, Sun Microsystems Laboratories     * The computational environment for online games or virtual worlds is close to the exact inverse of that found in most markets serviced by the high-tech industry.   * The need for a heavyweight client is, in part, an outcome of the evolution of these games.    * Latency is the enemy of fun—and therefore the enemy of online games and virtual worlds.    * The game server is used both to discourage cheating (by making it much more difficult) and to detect cheating (by seeing patterns of divergence between the game state reported by the client and the game state held by the server). Peer-to-peer technologies might seem a natural fit for the first role of the game server, but this second role means that few if any games or worlds trust their peers enough to avoid the server component.   * Using multiple servers is a basic mecha</p><p>4 0.86850834 <a title="1399-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-25-GridGain%3A__One_Compute_Grid%2C_Many_Data_Grids.html">393 high scalability-2008-09-25-GridGain:  One Compute Grid, Many Data Grids</a></p>
<p>Introduction: GridGain   was kind enough to present at the September 17th instance of  the   Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Group  . I've been curious about GridGain so I was glad to see them there. In short GridGain is:   an open source computational grid framework that enables Java developers to improve general performance of processing intensive applications by splitting and parallelizing the workload  . GridGain can also be thought of as a set of middleware primitives for building applications. GridGain's peer group of competitors includes GigaSpaces, Terracotta, Coherence, and Hadoop.     The speaker for GridGain was the President and Founder, Nikita Ivanov. He has a very pleasant down-to-earth way about him that contrasts nicely with a field given to religious discussions of complex taxomic definitions. Nikita first talked about cloud computing in general. He feels Java is the perfect gateway for cloud computing. Which is good because   GridGain only works with Java  .

<p>Introduction: Hi everybody :)We have a bunch of webservers (about 14 at this time) running
Apache. As application framework we're using PHP with the APC Cache installed
to improve performance. For load balancing we're using a Big F5 system with
dynamic ratio (SNMP driven)To sync new/updated sourcecode we're using
subversion to "automaticly" update these servers with our latest software
relases. After updating the new source to these production servers the load of
the mashines is raising to hell.While updating the servers, they are still in
"production", serving webpages to the users. Otherwise the process of updating
would take ages. Most of the time we're only updating in the morning hours
while less users are online, because of the above issue.My guess is, that the
load is raising that high, because APC needs to recompile a bunch of new files
each time. Before and while compiling the performance simply is "bad".My goal
would be to find a better solution. We want to "sync" code no matter how many

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post fromPer Buer, founder and CEO of Varnish Software,
provider of Varnish Cache, an open source web application accelerator freely
available at varnish-cache.org. Varnish powers a lot of really big websites
worldwide.We at Varnish Software are all about speed. Varnish Cache is built
for speed. It executes its policy code more or less a thousand times faster
than your typical Java or PHP based application servers, mostly due to the
fact that the configuration is compiled into system call free machine
code.System calls require expensive context switches, stall the CPU and wreck
havoc in the CPU cache so avoiding them makes the code fly. There are strong
limitations on what kind of logic you can move into Varnish Cache, but the
logic that you do move there will run very fast.An example is using Varnish
for access control to serve access controlled content from the caching edge
layer.The Varnish PaywallWho gets to access your content? In a traditional
environment the cach</p><p>4 0.15855245 <a title="1486-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-28-A_Practical_Guide_to_Varnish_-_Why_Varnish_Matters.html">996 high scalability-2011-02-28-A Practical Guide to Varnish - Why Varnish Matters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byJeff Sufrom Factual.What is Varnish?Varnishis an open
source, high performance http accelerator that sits in front of a web stack
and caches pages.  This caching layer is very configurable and can be used for
both static and dynamic content.One great thing about Varnish is that it can
improve the performance of your website without requiring any code changes.
If you haven't heard of Varnish (or have heard of it, but haven't used it),
please read on.  Adding Varnish to your stack can be completely noninvasive,
but if you tweak your stack to play along with some of varnish's more advanced
features, you'll be able to increase performance by orders of magnitude.Some
of the high profile companies using Varnish include: Twitter, Facebook, Heroku
and LinkedIn.Our Use CaseOne of Factual's first high profile projects was
Newsweek's "America's Best High Schools: The List". After realizing that we
had only a few weeks to increase our throughput by tenfold, we looked into a</p><p>5 0.15424171 <a title="1486-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-12-Poppen.de_Architecture.html">808 high scalability-2010-04-12-Poppen.de Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest a post by Alvaro Videla describing their architecture
forPoppen.de, a popular German dating site. This site is very much NSFW, so be
careful before clicking on the link. What I found most interesting is how they
manage to sucessfully blend a little of the old with a little of the new,
using technologies like Nginx, MySQL, CouchDB, and Erlang, Memcached,
RabbitMQ, PHP, Graphite, Red5, and Tsung.What is Poppen.de?Poppen.de (NSFW) is
the top dating website in Germany, and while it may be a small site compared
to giants like Flickr or Facebook, we believe it's a nice architecture to
learn from if you are starting to get some scaling problems.The Stats2.000.000

<p>Introduction: eAcceleratoris a free open-source PHP accelerator, optimizer, and dynamic
content cache. It increases the performance of PHP scripts by caching them in
their compiled state, so that the overhead of compiling is almost completely
eliminated. It also optimizes scripts to speed up their execution.
eAccelerator typically reduces server load and increases the speed of your PHP
code by 1-10 times.</p><p>3 0.74202394 <a title="1486-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-09-Site_Moves_from_PHP_to_Facebook%27s_HipHop%2C_Now_Pages_Load_in_.6_Seconds_Instead_of_Five.html">1561 high scalability-2013-12-09-Site Moves from PHP to Facebook's HipHop, Now Pages Load in .6 Seconds Instead of Five</a></p>

Virtual Machine for PHP? With HipHop Facebook achieved over a 9x increase in
web request throughput and over a 5x reduction in memory consumption compared
to Zend PHP 5.2 engine + APC.But will HipHop really work for you? Is it really
drop-in compatible? Is it really as fast as they say?To answer questions like
this nothing beats a good experience report and here's a great one:Adventures
in Configuring and Running Facebook's HipHopVM (hhvm) JIT Compiler for PHP by
Yermo Lamers.Yermo selected PHP to implement a number of content web sites. He
took an interesting approach, he created a forms, views, validation, and
business logic description language to remove the drudgery of creating the
same code over and over again for each page. Having done this in Perl I think
it's a great a approach. The problem is it can be slow. PHP's slow string

<p>Introduction: ThemBid provides a market where people needing work done broadcast their
request and accept bids from people competing for the job. Unlike many of the
sites profiled at HighScalability, ThemBid is not in the popular press as
often as Paris Hilton. It's not a media darling or a giant of the industry.
But what I like is they have a strategy, a point-of-view for building websites
and were gracious enough to share very detailed instructions on how to go
about building a website. They even delve into actual installation details of
the various software packages they use. Anyone can benefit by taking a look at
their work.Site: http://www.thembid.com/Information SourcesBuild Scalable Web

<p>Introduction: Hi,I would like feed back on a ID generator I just made. What positive and
negative effects do you see with this. It's programmed in Java, but could just
as easily be programmed in any other typical language. It's thread safe and
does not use any synchronization. When testing it on my laptop, I was able to
generate 10 million IDs within about 15 seconds, so it should be more than
fast enough.Take a look at the attachment.. (had to rename it from IdGen.java

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Block, CTO atRockThePost.com, a crowdfunding company, haswritten a
nice set of tipsfor smaller sites on how to scale a service on EC2 using a
small two person development team. Their service has a typical small scale
structure:PHP's Zend Framework 2Two m1.medium for web serversELB to split the
loadmaster/slave MySQL databaseSiege for load testingThe very sensible tips
that can handle 30,000 concurrent users per web server: Use PHP's APC feature.
APC is opcode cache that is "really a requirement in order for a website to
have a chance at performing well."Put everything that's not a .php request on
a CDN. Don't serve static files from your web server. They put everything on
S3 and use CloudFront as their CDN. Recent CloudFront problems have caused
them to serve directly from S3.Don't make connections to other servers in your
PHP code. Making connections to other servers blocks the server and slows down
processing. Use the APC key/value store for data storage and Varnish for

<p>Introduction: Smart Inspecthas added quite a few features specifically tailored to
highscalability and high performance environments to our tool over the
years.This includes the ability to log to memory and dump log files on
demand(when a crash occurs for example), special backlog queue features, a
logservice application for central log storage and a lot more.
Additionally,our SmartInspect Console (the viewer application) makes viewing,
filteringand inspecting large amounts of logging data a lot easier/practical.</p><p>6 0.76610726 <a title="1486-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-24-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_24%2C_2013.html">1464 high scalability-2013-05-24-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 24, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Pomegranateis a novel distributed file system built over distributed tabular
storage that acts an awful lot like a NoSQL system. It's targeted at
increasing the performance of tiny object access in order to support
applications like online photo and micro-blog services, which require high
concurrency, high throughput, and low latency. Their tests seem to indicate it
works:We have demonstrate that file system over tabular storage performs well
for highly concurrent access. In our test cluster, we observedlinearly
increased more than100,000aggregate read and write requests served per second
(RPS). Rather than sitting atop the file system like almost every other K-V
store, Pomegranate is baked into file system. The idea is that the file system
API is common to every platform so it wouldn't require a separate API to use.

<p>Introduction: Hi. I'm looking for a way to share files between EC2 nodes. Currently we are
using glusterfs to do this. It has been reliable recently, but in the past it
has crashed under high load and we've had trouble starting it up again. We've
only been able to restart it by removing the files, restarting the cluster,
and filing it up again with our files from backup. This takes ages, and will
take even longer the more files we get.What worries me is that it seems to
make each node a point of failure for the entire system. One node crashes and
soon the entire cluster has crashed. The other problem is adding another node.
It seems like you have to take down the whole thing, reconfigure to include
the new node, and restart. This kind of defeats the horizontal scaling
strategy.We are using 2 EC2 instances as web servers, 1 as a DB master, and 1
as a slave. GlusterFS is installed on the web server machines as well as the
DB slave machine (we backup files to s3 from this machine). The files are
mostly</p><p>4 0.084269747 <a title="1442-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-10-Riak%27s_Bitcask_-_A_Log-Structured_Hash_Table_for_Fast_Key-Value_Data.html">971 high scalability-2011-01-10-Riak's Bitcask - A Log-Structured Hash Table for Fast Key-Value Data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How would you implement a key-value storage system if you were starting from
scratch? The approach Basho settled on withBitcask, their new backend for
Riak, is an interesting combination of using RAM to store a hash map of file
pointers to values and a log-structured file system for efficient writes.  In
this excellent Changelog interview, some folks from Basho describe Bitcask in
more detail.The essential Bitcask:Keys are stored in memory for fast lookups.
All keys must fit in RAM.Writes are append-only, which means writes are
strictly sequential and do not require seeking. Writes are write-through.
Every time a value is updated the data file on disk is appended and the in-
memory key index is updated with the file pointer.Read queries are satisfied
with O(1) random disk seeks. Latency is very predictable if all keys fit in
memory because there's no random seeking around through a file.For reads, the
file system cache in the kernel is used instead of writing a complicated
caching sche</p><p>5 0.079812646 <a title="1442-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Are_Cloud_Based_Memory_Architectures_the_Next_Big_Thing%3F.html">538 high scalability-2009-03-16-Are Cloud Based Memory Architectures the Next Big Thing?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-
grid.It's 2003: Add a caching layer.It's 2004: Add scale-out and
partitioning.It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a
distributed file system.It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.It's 2008: Cloud

<p>Introduction: Tachyon  (github) is interesting new filesystem brought to by the folks at
theUC Berkeley AMP Lab:Tachyon is a fault tolerant distributed ďŹ le system
enabling reliable file sharing at memory-speed across cluster frameworks, such
as Spark and MapReduce.It offers up to 300 times higher throughput than HDFS,
by leveraging lineage information and using memory aggressively. Tachyon
caches working set files in memory, and enables different jobs/queries and
frameworks to access cached files at memory speed. Thus, Tachyon avoids going
to disk to load datasets that is frequently read.It has a Java-like File API,
native support for raw tables, a pluggable file system, and it works with
Hadoop with no modifications. It might work well for streaming media too as
you wouldn't have to wait for the complete file to hit the disk before
rendering.Discuss on Hacker News</p><p>2 0.85698348 <a title="1442-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-07-3_Secrets_to_Lightning_Fast_Mobile_Design_at_Instagram.html">1259 high scalability-2012-06-07-3 Secrets to Lightning Fast Mobile Design at Instagram</a></p>
<p>Introduction: InSecrets to Lightning Fast Mobile Design, Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger
shares three strategies Instagram uses to outsmart high latency mobile
networks and make mobile apps feel faster than they really are, which helped
Instagram reach 12 million users in 12 months:The motivation:"mobile
experiences fill gaps while we wait. no one wants to wait while they
wait"Perform actions optimistically. Make the user feel productive. Likes,
comments, and follows are registered on screen while the like operation is
being sent in the background. Adaptively preload content. Load content before
it's needed. Don't images according to time, it will take too long, instead
re-prioritize based on interest. Show what the social network things is the
most popular. Listen to what your user's flicks and taps are telling you.Move
bits when no-one is watching.Picture uploading startsbeforeyou share them,
most apps wait until after the share screen. The rule is send data as soon as
it's ready, then match it</p><p>3 0.83506846 <a title="1442-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-19-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_19%2C_2013.html">1443 high scalability-2013-04-19-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 19, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Film buffs will recognize Django as a classic 1966 spaghetti western that
spawned hundreds of imitators. Web heads will certainly first think of Django
as the classic Python based Web framework that has also spawned hundreds of
imitators and has become the gold standard framework for the web.Mike Malone,
who worked on Pownce, a blogging tool now owned by Six Apart, tells in this
very informative EuroDjangoCon presentation how Pownce scaled using Django in
the real world.I was surprised to learn how large Pounce was: hundreds of
requests/sec, thousands of DB operations/sec, millions of user relationships,
millions of notes, and terabytes of static data. Django has a lot of
functionality in the box to help you scale, but if you want to scale large it
turns out Django has some limitations and Mike tells you what these are and
also provides some code to get around them.Mike's talk-although Django
specific--will really help anyone creating applications on the web. There's a
lot of useful Dj</p><p>5 0.82035291 <a title="1442-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-17-Against_all_the_odds.html">658 high scalability-2009-07-17-Against all the odds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This article not about Mariah Carey, or its song. It's about Storing System,
Database.First let's describe what means by odds: In my social network, I
found 93% of the mainstream developers sanctify the database, or at least
consider it in any data persistence challenge as the ultimate, superhero, and
undefeatable solution.I think this problem come from the education,
personally, and some companies also I think it's involved in this.To start to
fix this bad thinking, we all should agree in the following points:Every
challenge have its own solutions, so whatever you want to save/persistent,
there are always many solutions. For example the Web search engines, such as:
Google, Kngine, Yahoo, Bing don't use database at all instead we use Indexes
(Index file) for better performance.The Database in general whatever the
vendor it's slow compared with other solutions such as: Key-Value storing
system, Index file, DHT.The Database currently employ Relation Data model, or
Object relational data</p><p>6 0.81537634 <a title="1442-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-18-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_October_18th%2C_2013.html">1534 high scalability-2013-10-18-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For October 18th, 2013</a></p>

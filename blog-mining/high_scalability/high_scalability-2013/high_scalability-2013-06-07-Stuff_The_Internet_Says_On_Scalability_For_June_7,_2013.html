 Quotable Quotes:                                   
 
  @PenLlawen : @spolsky In my time as a scalability engineer, I’ve seen plenty of cases where optimisation was left too late. Even harder to fix. 
  @davidlubar : Whoever said you can't fold a piece of paper in half more than 7 times probably forget to unfold it each time. I'm up to 6,000. 
  deno :  A quick comparison of App Engine vs. Compute Engine prices shows that App Engine is at best 10x more expensive per unit of RAM. 
  Fred Wilson : strategy is figuring out what part of the market the company wants to play in, how it goes to market, and how it differentiates itself in the market it is about what you are going to do and importantly what you are not going to do 
  Elon Musk : SpaceX was able to achieve orders of magnitude saving</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 Instead of looking at what other rockets cost, they looked at the material cost (which is only 1-2% of total cost) which was small; clearly people were doing silly things on how the rockets were put together; for SpaceX, the savings came from efficiently putting the rocket together! [sent-9, score-0.383]
</p><p>2 Shows how GCE may start to cannibalize GAE even though they seem to be targeted at different market segments. [sent-11, score-0.163]
</p><p>3 In this case GCE cost about a third of what GAE cost with much more performance headroom and much better latency. [sent-13, score-0.174]
</p><p>4 Murat Demirbas with his usual excellent analysis of how Facebook handles read dominated workloads (which are two orders of magnitude more frequent than writes), over 1 billion reads/second, with very high fan-out. [sent-17, score-0.132]
</p><p>5 2) Managing stateful components is operationally more complex than stateless ones. [sent-19, score-0.079]
</p><p>6 As a result keeping logic in a stateless client helps iterate on features and minimize disruption. [sent-20, score-0.079]
</p><p>7 3) Finally Facebook treats the probability of reading transient stale data as a parameter to be tuned, and is willing to expose slightly stale data in exchange for insulating a backend storage service from excessive load. [sent-21, score-0.241]
</p><p>8 Michael Bernstein says  Real-Time Garbage Collection Is Real  as long as you are willing to make the necessary tradeoffs. [sent-22, score-0.077]
</p><p>9 Bryan Talbot had a lot of useful suggestions: remove data (rows especially), add nodes, add RAM, reduce bloom filter space, reduce row and key cache sizes, increase index sample ration, reduce compaction and concurrency and throughput, update to Cassandra 1. [sent-35, score-0.069]
</p><p>10 Atomic I/O operations : for many situations, atomic I/O operations look like a good way to let the hardware help the software get better performance from solid-state drives. [sent-37, score-0.075]
</p><p>11 Like this from Elon Musk: This is a great example of how disruption gets talked about in early stages – all the focus on whether electric cars can displace gas cars using the criteria gas cars developed over all this time. [sent-44, score-0.688]
</p><p>12 Scaling the Database: Why You Shouldn’t Cluster on GUIDs : it’s pretty common for the DBA or developer to leave the primary key set as the default clustering key — that is a problem. [sent-45, score-0.138]
</p><p>13 Bryan Wagstaff with a mystical magical  Journey Through the CPU Pipeline : What goes on inside the CPU? [sent-47, score-0.067]
</p><p>14 It's good to see ants and humans finding a basis of cooperation. [sent-50, score-0.174]
</p><p>15 Majid Sarvi : used repellent to make ants flee from various structures. [sent-51, score-0.241]
</p><p>16 Time is money: How Clash of Clans earns $500,000 a day with in-app purchases : In other words, gems mean instant satisfaction. [sent-62, score-0.241]
</p><p>17 Textbook biology teaches us that DNA encodes digital data in sequences of four kinds of monomers—nucleotides—each bearing two bits of data and read in blocks of six-bit words that encode the twenty standard amino acids found in proteins. [sent-65, score-0.126]
</p><p>18 Ribosomes read this information, produce the specified proteins, and thereby build the molecular components and devices that are so central to the workings of everything else in the cell, including the ribosomes themselves. [sent-66, score-0.134]
</p><p>19 It produces joined logs that are used to derive key business metrics, including billing for advertisers. [sent-68, score-0.069]
</p><p>20 Omega: ﬂexible, scalable schedulers for large compute clusters : We present a novel approach to address these needs using parallelism, shared state, and lock-free optimistic concurrency control. [sent-70, score-0.184]

<p>Introduction: When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things . -- Corinthians
 
 With this new pricing, developments will be driven by the costs .  I like to optimize my apps to make them better or faster, but to optimize them just to make them cheaper is a waste of time.  -- Sylvain on  Google Groups 
 
The dream is dead. Google App Engine's bold  pay for what you use  dream dies as it leaves childish things behind and becomes a  real product .  Pricing will change . Architectures will change. Customers will change. Hearts and minds will change. But Google App Engine  will survive.   
 
Google is  shutting down  many of its  projects . GAE is not among them. Do we have GAE's pricing change to thank for it surving the  more wood behind  more deadly arrows push? Without a radical and quick shift towards profitably GAE would no doubt be a historical footnote in the long scroll of good ideas.

<p>Introduction: Update 6: :  Back to the Future for Data Storage .  We are in the middle of a renaissance in data storage with the application of many new ideas and techniques; there's huge potential for breaking out of thinking about data storage in just one way.   Update 5 :  Building Scalable Web Applications with Google App Engine  by Brett Slatkin.
 
 Update 4 :  Why Google App Engine is broken and what Google must do to fix it  by Aral Balkan.  We don't care that it can scale. We care that it does scale. And that it scales when you need it the most.   Issues: 1MB limit on data structures; 1MB limit on data structures; the short-term high CPU quota; quotas in general; Admin? What's that?  Update 3 : BigTable  Blues . Catherine Devlin couldn't port an application to GAE because it can't do basic filtering and can't search 5,000 records without timing out: "Querying from 5000 records - too much for the mighty BigTable, apparently."

<p>Introduction: After poking around the   Google Compute Engine    (GCE) documentation I had some trouble creating a mental model of how GCE works. Is it like AWS, GAE, Rackspace, just what is it? After watching    Google I/O 2012 - Introducing Google Compute Engine    and    Google Compute Engine -- Technical Details   , it turns out my initial impression, that GCE is disarmingly straightforward, turns out to be the point.     The focus of GCE is on the C, which stands for Compute, and that’s what GCE is all about: deploying lots of servers to solve computationally hard problems. What you get with GCE is a Super Datacenter on Google Steroids.     If you are wondering how you will run the next Instagram on GCE then that would be missing the point. GAE is targeted at applications. GCE is targeted at:

<p>Introduction: How do you scale a viral Facebook app that has skyrocketed to a mind boggling 65 million installs (the population of France)? That's the fortunate problem  BuddyPoke  co-founder Dave Westwood has and he talked about his solution at Wednesday's  Facebook Meetup . Slides for the complete talk are  here .  For those not quite sure what BuddyPoke is, it's a social network application that lets users show their mood, hug, kiss, and poke their friends through on-line avatars.
 
In many ways BuddyPoke is the quintessentially modern web application. It thrives off the energy of social network driven ecosystems. Game play mechanics, viral loops, and creative monetization strategies are all part of if its everyday conceptualization. It mashes together different technologies, not in a dark Frankensteining sort of way,  but in a smart way that gets the most bang for the buck. Part of it runs on Facebook servers (free). Part of it runs on flash in a browser (free). Part of it runs on a storage clou</p><p>6 0.83629632 <a title="1472-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-07-What_Google_App_Engine_Price_Changes_Say_About_the_Future_of_Web_Architecture.html">1112 high scalability-2011-09-07-What Google App Engine Price Changes Say About the Future of Web Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Enterprises want to protect their data.   As the appetite for data volumes grows, storage technology becomes a critical business asset on which business continuity relies.  My recent survey in the medium-size enterprise segment shows the five dominant investment directions at the level of data management architecture: disaster recovery (DR), high availability (HA), backup, data processing performance and migration to more advanced databases.﻿
   
  This suggests that corporations generally have sufficiently structured data collections but are concerned with business continuity and continuous availability of data. What infrastructures can provide these assurances? In this post I want to focus on yet another option, and that is the Real-Time Data Integration model. As an example I am going to discuss Oracle GoldenGate, which permits you to manage the data critical to your business in safety, ensuring business continuity without disruption even if the data is distributed among multiple, h</p><p>3 0.97728759 <a title="1472-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-15-Book%3A_Building_Scalable_Web_Sites.html">10 high scalability-2007-07-15-Book: Building Scalable Web Sites</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Building, scaling, and optimizing the next generation of web applications. Learn the tricks of the trade so you can build and architect applications that scale quickly--without all the high-priced headaches and service-level agreements associated with enterprise app servers and proprietary programming and database products. Culled from the experience of the Flickr.com lead developer, Building Scalable Web Sites offers techniques for creating fast sites that your visitors will find a pleasure to use.     Creating popular sites requires much more than fast hardware with lots of memory and hard drive space. It requires thinking about how to grow over time, how to make the same resources accessible to audiences with different expectations, and how to have a team of developers work on a site without creating new problems for visitors and for each other.

<p>Introduction: It's HighScalability Time:
  
 Quotable Quotes:        
 
  @rbranson : So turns out the EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes are not total shit. This injects the man with a few weeks of runway. 
  @markzohar : It is amazing to witness the efficiency & scalability of algorithms. Given the choice, build your tech company on algorithms not code. 
 
 
  Your Bottleneck is Dead. Long Live Your Bottleneck . Mailinator's Paul Tyma brings up the interesting notion that once bottlenecks have moved to the CPU because programs can nolonger hide behind IO overhead - code efficiency becomes important again. 
  Facebook Moving To The JVM : The main seismic event will be nothing less than the complete removal of interpretors from main stream general purpose programming.  
  Improved HTTPS Performance with Early SSL Termination . Filepicker.io has found early SSL termination cuts the time from 384ms to 146ms, over 200ms improvement.  ( on Hacker News )

<p>Introduction: O'Reilly Radar's James Turner conducted a  very informative interview  with Joe Stump, current CTO of  SimpleGeo  and former lead architect at  Digg , in which Joe makes some of his usually insightful comments on his experience using Cassandra vs MySQL. As Digg started out with a  MySQL oriented architecture  and has recently been  moving full speed  to Cassandra, his observations on some of their lessons learned and the motivation for the move are especially valuable. Here are some of the key takeaways you find useful:
  
  Precompute on writes, make reads fast . This is an oldie as a scaling strategy, but it's valuable to see how SimpleGeo is applying it to their problem of finding entities within a certain geographical region. Using Cassandra they've built two clusters: one for indexes and one for records. The records cluster, as you might imagine, is a simple data lookup. The index cluster has a carefully constructed key for every lookup scenario. The indexes are computed on the wr</p><p>6 0.9758808 <a title="1472-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-29-Event%3A_MySQL_Conference_%26_Expo_2009.html">504 high scalability-2009-01-29-Event: MySQL Conference & Expo 2009</a></p>

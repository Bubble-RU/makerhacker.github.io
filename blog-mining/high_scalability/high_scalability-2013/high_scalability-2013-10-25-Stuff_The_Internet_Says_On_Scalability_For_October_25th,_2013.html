<p>Introduction: Awesome paper on how particular synchronization mechanisms scale on multi-core
architectures: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Synchronization but
Were Afraid to Ask.The goal is to pick a locking approach that doesn't degrade
as the number of cores increase. Like everything else in life, that doesn't
appear to be generically possible:None of the nine locking schemes we consider
consistently outperforms any other one, on all target architectures or
workloads. Strictly speaking, to seek optimality, a lock algorithm should thus
be selected based on the hardware platform and the expected workload.
Abstract:This paper presents the most exhaustive study of synchronization to
date. We span multiple layers, from hardware cache-coherence protocols up to
high-level concurrent software. We do so on different types architectures,
from single-socket - uniform and nonuniform - to multi-socket - directory and
broadcastbased - many-cores. We draw a set of observations that, roughly

want to get going. Understanding what's going on under the hood isn't that
important. As grows, want more control and go under the hood. Managing that
balance through lifecycle is important.@rbranson: What does almost every

<p>Introduction: A conjunction of a few new technologies may trigger disruptive changes in the
future. This observation was prompted by a talkSteve Perlmangave at the
Columbia Engineering School: Benjamin Button, Cloud Everything and Why
Shannon's Law Isn't. In it he covers a set of technologies that at first may
seem unrelated, but turn out to be deeply related after all, culminating in a
realization of the long talked about vision of an application utility, where
all applications are hosted and run out of the cloud. First Perlman talks
about the realistic human rendering technology developed at Rearden, his
research incubator company. This technology was developed over many years and
is the secret behind the wonderful effects found in movies likeBenjamin
Button. It is now being used in many other films, and promises to
revolutionize film making, possibly even replacing actors with computers, in
real-time.The next invention at Rearden isOnLive, a cloud based gaming

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.Urbandiveis an immersive view service launched by theFrench
YellowPageswhich allows you to travel in cities in France thanks to a 360°
view. Urbandive focuses on providing high definition pictures and accurate
professional and social content. One of the biggest jobs was to enable a fast
scalable architecture, because it was really difficult to forecast the traffic
load at production time. Traffic load may be influenced if the service
receives attention from users as a result of advertising.Below you will find a
summary of the goals we achieve by using a Ruby scheduler built on top
ofPuppetonAWSto create a complete infrastructure.Workflow & XTR-LucidOur
scalability combo is : a home-made Ruby scheduler (XTR-Lucid) to deal with AWS
APIs + the Puppet Master to install services and configure EC2 instances and
keep them up-to-date during all the production time. This leads to full

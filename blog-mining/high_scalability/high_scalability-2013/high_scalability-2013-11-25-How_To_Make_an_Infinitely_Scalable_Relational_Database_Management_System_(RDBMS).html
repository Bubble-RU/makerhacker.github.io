  InfiniSQL is the specific "Infinitely Scalable RDBMS" to which the title refers. It is free software, and instructions for getting, building, running and testing it are available in the  guide .    Benchmarking  shows that an InfiniSQL cluster can handle over 500,000 complex transactions per second with over 100,000 simultaneous connections, all on twelve small servers. The methods used to test are documented, and the code is all available so that any practitioner can achieve similar results. There are two main characteristics which make InfiniSQL extraordinary:
  
 It performs transactions with records on multiple nodes better than any clustered/distributed RDBMS

[sent-65, score-0.258]
</p><p>2 For the sake of  Durability , traditional databases write all transactions that contain written records to the equivalent of a log file, in real time, before finishing a transaction. [sent-66, score-0.226]
</p><p>3 Actors   InfiniSQL implements a variation on the  actor model  of concurrent programming. [sent-75, score-0.336]
</p><p>4 C++ is the main language used to create InfiniSQL, and the actor model isn't natively supported in that language. [sent-76, score-0.336]
</p><p>5 The actor model solves the first two problems described above by uncoupling transaction processing logic from storage and by not locking memory regions. [sent-78, score-0.679]
</p><p>6 The actor model solves  The Problem  because processing logic is handled by one set of actors, and data storage is handled by another set. [sent-81, score-0.46]
</p><p>7 Messaging happens between actors regardless of the node that they reside upon: the actor which governs a particular transaction doesn't know or care whether the data resides locally or remotely. [sent-83, score-0.517]
</p><p>8 And the actor that manages a particular data partition responds to messages regardless of origin. [sent-84, score-0.327]
</p><p>9 In theory, the actor model allows InfiniSQL to scale without limit. [sent-85, score-0.336]
</p><p>10 Another beneficial effect of the actor model is that it solves the problem of low level locking. [sent-87, score-0.399]
</p><p>11 Since each data region only has a single actor associated, there is no need for mutexes or semaphores to restrict access. [sent-88, score-0.402]
</p><p>12 The partition's actor handles requests for data manipulation based on messages from transaction actors. [sent-89, score-0.381]
</p><p>13 The sending actor isn't held up (blocked) waiting for a response but instead is free to work on other tasks. [sent-90, score-0.261]
</p><p>14 When the partition's actor responds with data, the requesting transaction actor resumes where it left off. [sent-91, score-0.676]
</p><p>15 Here's an example that attempts to graphically illustrate the difference between the traditional shared memory model of database design and InfiniSQL's actor model:        With actors, there's no locking. [sent-93, score-0.518]
</p><p>16 As more processing is necessary, more actors are added, with each actor  roughly  optimally corresponding to a single CPU thread or core. [sent-94, score-0.5]
</p><p>17 However, the traditional locked shared memory model suffers the more that cores are added--because lock contention only increases. [sent-96, score-0.311]
</p><p>18 Another benefit of the actor model is that it supports massive concurrency. [sent-98, score-0.336]
</p><p>19 InfiniSQL implements actors slightly differently than the traditional actor model, but it still achieves a very high connection rate while maintaining high throughput. [sent-99, score-0.519]
</p><p>20 And to minimize context switching, each actor roughly corresponds to a single CPU thread, so there are fewer threads waiting for CPU. [sent-108, score-0.261]

<p>Introduction: This is an email interview with   Viktor Klang   , Director of Engineering at    Typesafe   , on the    Scala Futures    model &    Akka,    both topics on which is he is immensely passionate and knowledgeable.  
 
How do you structure your application? That’s the question I explored in the article  Beyond Threads And Callbacks . An option I did not talk about, mostly because of my own ignorance, is a powerful stack you may not be all that familiar with: Scala and Akka.
   To remedy my oversight is our acting tour guide, Typesafe’s Viktor Klang, long time Scala hacker and Java enterprise systems architect. Viktor was very patient in answering my questions and was enthusiastic about sharing his knowledge. He’s a guy who definitely knows what he is talking about. 
   I’ve implemented several Actor systems along with the messaging infrastructure, threading, async IO, service orchestration, failover, etc, so I’m innately skeptical about frameworks that remove control from the programmer at</p><p>3 0.16524732 <a title="1553-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-18-Beyond_Threads_and_Callbacks_-_Application_Architecture_Pros_and_Cons.html">1425 high scalability-2013-03-18-Beyond Threads and Callbacks - Application Architecture Pros and Cons</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There's not a lot  of talk about application architectures at the process level. You have your threads, pools of threads, and you have your callback models. That's about it. Languages/frameworks making a virtue out of simple models, like Go and Erlang, do so at the price of control. It's difficult to make a low latency well conditioned application when a power full tool, like work scheduling, is taken out of the hands of the programmer.
 
But that's not all there is my friend. We'll dive into different ways an application can be composed across threads of control.
 
Your favorite language may not give you access to all the capabilities we are going to talk about, but lately there has been a sort of revival in considering performance important, especially for controlling  latency variance , so I think it's time to talk about these kind of issues. When it was do everything in the thread of a web server thread pool none of these issues really mattered.

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.   Let's take a short trip down web architecture lane:
  It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl scripts and a SQL database   It's 1995: Scale-up the database.   It's 1998: LAMP   It's 1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SAN   It's 2001: In-memory data-grid.   It's 2003: Add a caching layer.   It's 2004: Add scale-out and partitioning.   It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a distributed file system.   It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.

<p>Introduction: The abstract for the talk given by Bob Ippolito, co-founder and CTO of Mochi Media, Inc:
   Building large systems on top of a traditional single-master RDBMS data storage layer is no longer good enough. This talk explores the landscape of new technologies available today to augment your data layer to improve performance and reliability. Is your application a good fit for caches, bloom filters, bitmap indexes, column stores, distributed key/value stores, or document databases? Learn how they work (in theory and practice) and decide for yourself.   
Bob does an excellent job highlighting different products and the key concepts to understand when pondering the wide variety of new database offerings. It's unlikely you'll be able to say oh, this is the database for me after watching the presentation, but you will be much better informed on your options. And I imagine slightly confused as to what to do :-)  An interesting observation in the talk is that the more robust products are internal</p><p>6 0.090073861 <a title="1553-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-22-Spanner_-_It%27s_About_Programmers_Building_Apps_Using_SQL_Semantics_at_NoSQL_Scale.html">1345 high scalability-2012-10-22-Spanner - It's About Programmers Building Apps Using SQL Semantics at NoSQL Scale</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you stayed up all night watching the life reaffirming  Curiosity landing on Mars , then this paper,  High-Performance Concurrency Control Mechanisms for Main-Memory Databases , has nothing to do with that at all, but it is an excellent look at how to use optimistic MVCC schemes to reduce lock overhead on in-memory datastructures:
  A database system optimized for in-memory storage can support  much higher transaction rates than current systems.  However,  standard concurrency control methods used today do not scale to  the high transaction rates achievable by such systems. In this paper we introduce two efficient concurrency control methods specifically designed for main-memory databases. Both use multiversioning to isolate read-only transactions from updates but differ in  how atomicity is ensured: one is optimistic and one is pessimistic. To avoid expensive context switching, transactions  never block  during normal processing but they may have to wait before commit to ensure corr</p><p>3 0.85712123 <a title="1553-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-04-Top_Features_of_a_Scalable_Database.html">1276 high scalability-2012-07-04-Top Features of a Scalable Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Douglas Wilson, EMEA Field Application Engineer at Raima, based on insights from biulding their  Raima Database Manager . 
   Scalability and Hardware   
 Scalability is the ability to maintain performance as demands on the system increase, by adding further resources. Normally those resources will be in the form of hardware. Since processor speeds are no longer increasing much, scaling up the hardware normally means adding extra processors or cores, and more memory. 
   Scalability and Software   
 However, scalability requires software that can utilize the extra hardware effectively. The software must be designed to allow parallel processing. In the context of a database engine this means that the server component must be   multi-threaded  , to allow the operating system to schedule parallel tasks on all the cores that are available. Not only that, but the database engine must provide an efficient way to break its workload into as many parallel tasks as there</p><p>4 0.85216171 <a title="1553-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-08-Typesafe_Interview%3A_Scala_%2B_Akka_is_an_IaaS_for_Your_Process_Architecture.html">1454 high scalability-2013-05-08-Typesafe Interview: Scala + Akka is an IaaS for Your Process Architecture</a></p>

   I’ve implemented several Actor systems along with the messaging infrastructure, threading, async IO, service orchestration, failover, etc, so I’m innately skeptical about frameworks that remove control from the programmer at</p><p>5 0.84278995 <a title="1553-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-06-The_Quest_for_Database_Scale%3A_the_1_M_TPS_challenge_-_Three_Design_Points_and_Five_common_Bottlenecks_to_avoid.html">1643 high scalability-2014-05-06-The Quest for Database Scale: the 1 M TPS challenge - Three Design Points and Five common Bottlenecks to avoid</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This a guest post by  Rajkumar Iyer , a Member of Technical Staff at Aerospike. 
 
About a year ago, Aerospike embarked upon a quest to increase in-memory database performance - 1 Million TPS on a single inexpensive commodity server. NoSQL has the reputation of speed, and we saw great benefit from improving latency and throughput of cacheless architectures. At that time, we took a version of Aerospike delivering about 200K TPS, improved a few things - performance went to 500k TPS - and published the Aerospike 2.0 Community Edition. We then used kernel tuning techniques and published the  recipe  for how we achieved 1 M TPS on $5k of hardware.
  This year we continued the quest. Our goal was to achieve 1 Million database transactions per second per server; more than doubling previous performance. This compares to Cassandra’s boast of 1M TPS on over 300 servers in Google Compute Engine - at a cost of $2 million dollars per year. We  achieved this  without kernel tuning.

<p>Introduction: SmugMug's CEO & Chief Geek Don MacAskill smugly (hard to resist) gushes over finally finding, after a long and arduous quest, their "best bang-for-the-buck storage array."  It's the   Dell MD300  . His in-depth explanation of why he prefers the MD3000 should help anyone with their own painful storage deliberations. His key points are:        The price is right; DAS via SAS, 15 spindles at 15K rpm each, 512MB of mirrored battery-backed write cache; You can disable read caching; You can disable read-ahead prefetching; The stripe sizes are configurable up to 512KB; The controller ignores host-based flush commands by default; They support an ‘Enhanced JBOD’ mode.     His reasoning for the desirability each option is astute and he even gives you the configuration options for carrying out the configuration. This is not your average CEO.     Don also speculates that a three tier system using flash (system RAM + flash storage + RAID disks) is a possible future direction.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Mark Travis , Founder of  InfiniSQL . 
 
  InfiniSQL is the specific "Infinitely Scalable RDBMS" to which the title refers. It is free software, and instructions for getting, building, running and testing it are available in the  guide .    Benchmarking  shows that an InfiniSQL cluster can handle over 500,000 complex transactions per second with over 100,000 simultaneous connections, all on twelve small servers. The methods used to test are documented, and the code is all available so that any practitioner can achieve similar results. There are two main characteristics which make InfiniSQL extraordinary:
  
 It performs transactions with records on multiple nodes better than any clustered/distributed RDBMS 
 It is free, open source. Not just a teaser "community" version with the good stuff proprietary. The community version of InfiniSQL will also be the enterprise version, when it is ready. 
  
InfiniSQL is still in early stages of development--it already has m</p><p>3 0.9199701 <a title="1553-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-06-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_6th%2C_2011.html">1036 high scalability-2011-05-06-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 6th, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Andy Gelfond , VP of Engineering for TripAdvisor. Andy has been with TripAdvisor for six and a half years, wrote a lot of code in the earlier days, and has been building and running a first class engineering and operations team that is responsible for the worlds largest travel site. There's an update for this article at  An Epic TripAdvisor Update: Why Not Run On The Cloud? The Grand Experiment .  
 
For  TripAdvisor , scalability is woven into our organization on many levels - data center, software architecture, development/deployment/operations, and, most importantly, within the culture and organization. It is not enough to have a scalable data center, or a scalable software architecture. The process of designing, coding, testing, and deploying code also needs to be scalable. All of this starts with hiring and a culture and an organization that values and supports a distributed, fast, and effective development and operation of a complex and highly scalable co</p><p>6 0.90666586 <a title="1553-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-06-Building_a_Unique_Data_Warehouse.html">716 high scalability-2009-10-06-Building a Unique Data Warehouse</a></p>

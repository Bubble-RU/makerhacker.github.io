</p><p>5 Then you must gather to yourself the people capable of running these servers, creating the applications and cutting edge devices that tease out the data, store the data, learn from the data, and create a market for the data. [sent-13, score-0.25]
</p><p>6 A curious aspect of these new contextual systems, Robert noticed, is that they need to plan on scale from the start. [sent-17, score-0.479]
</p><p>7 Not only must the infrastructure scale to gather and process context and turn it into smart data, the cost of each new customer is now huge. [sent-18, score-0.658]
</p><p>8 In the contextual age economies of scale are not your friend. [sent-23, score-0.667]
</p><p>9 So much processing power is needed to bring on a new customer and to keep customer data updated with new context, that it's hard to keep up with demand. [sent-24, score-0.672]
</p><p>10 And the cost is always increasing because the amount of data and the number of links are always growing. [sent-28, score-0.254]

</p><p>12 " Tempo  uses AI  to generate a smart calendar and infer appointment details from context. [sent-34, score-0.329]
</p><p>13 In a  GigaOM interview , Tempo CEO Raj Singh explains exactly why each new customer is so expensive:     It takes a huge amount of computing resources to bring new customer online. [sent-36, score-0.594]
</p><p>14 Once the customer is on-boarded the burden on the AI lessens, though it does reprocess all of that data on a regular basis – any time new email or contact data is added to system, Tempo can generate new semantic links between new data and old. [sent-38, score-0.896]
</p><p>15 We re-process data constantly; to be semantically relevant and contextual, we’re constantly re-processing, this is very expensive (it’s like Google constantly re-crawling). [sent-40, score-0.47]
</p><p>16 Once separate database silos must be built, constantly rebuilt, and linked together. [sent-41, score-0.228]

<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the ACM Queue article have also been included.   Amazon grew from a tiny online bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden shared is version of Amazon's birth pangs in a series of blog articles

<p>Introduction: This post on  Prismatic ’s Architecture is adapted from an email conversation with Prismatic programmer  Jason Wolfe  .  What should you read on the web today? Any thoroughly modern person must solve this dilemma every day, usually using some occult process to divine what’s important in their many feeds: Twitter, RSS, Facebook, Pinterest, G+, email, Techmeme, and an uncountable numbers of other information sources.  Jason Wolfe from Prismatic has generously agreed to describe their thoroughly modern solution for answering the “what to read question” using lots of sexy words like Machine Learning, Social Graphs, BigData, functional programming, and in-memory real-time feed processing. The result is possibly even more occult, but this or something very much like it will be how we meet the challenge of finding interesting topics and stories hidden inside infinitely deep pools of information.

<p>Introduction: I remember the excitement of when Twitter first opened up their firehose.  As an early adopter of the Twitter API I could easily imagine some of the cool things you could do with all that data. I also remember the disappointment of learning that in the land of BigData, data has a price, and that price would be too high for little fish like me. It was like learning for the first time there would be no BigData Santa Clause.
 
For a while though I had the pleasure of pondering just how I would handle all that data. It's a fascinating problem. You have to be able to reliably consume it, normalize it, merge it with other data, apply functions on it, store it, query it, distribute it, and oh yah, monetize it. Most of that in realish-time. And if you are trying to create a platform for allowing the entire Internet do to the same thing to the firehose, the challenge is exponentially harder.

<p>Introduction: Kevin Burton calculates that   Blekko  , one of the barbarian hoard storming Google's search fortress, would need to spend $5 million just to buy enough weapons, er storage.      Kevin estimates storing a deep crawl of the internet would take about 5 petabytes. At a projected $1 million per petabyte that's a paltry $5 million. Less than expected. Imagine in days of old an ambitious noble itching to raise an army to conquer a land and become its new prince. For a fine land, and the search market is one of the richest, that would be a smart investment for a VC to make.      In these situations I always ask: What would Machiavelli do?        Machiavelli taught some lands are hard to conquer and easy to keep and some are easy to conquer and hard to keep. A land like France was easy to conquer because it was filled with nobles. You can turn nobles on each other because they always hate each other for some reason or another. But it's hard to keep a land of nobles because they all think they</p><p>same-blog 2 0.88480014 <a title="1430-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-27-The_Changing_Face_of_Scale_-_The_Downside_of_Scaling_in_the_Contextual_Age_.html">1430 high scalability-2013-03-27-The Changing Face of Scale - The Downside of Scaling in the Contextual Age </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble  is a kind of Brothers Grimm for the digital age. Instead of inspired romantics walking around the country side collecting the folk tales of past ages, he is an inspired technologist documenting the current mythology of startups.
 
One of the developments Robert is exploring is the rise of the  contextual age . Where every bit of information about you is continually being prodded, pulled, and observed, shoveled into a great learning machine, and turned into a fully actionable  knowledge graph  of context. A digital identity more real to software than your physical body ever was. 
 
Sinner or saviour, the Age of Context has interesting implications for startups. It raises the entrance bar to dizzying heights. Much of the reason companies are tearing down the Golden Age of the Web, one open protocol at a time, is to create a walled garden of monopolized information.
 
To operate in this world you will have to somehow create a walled garden of your own. And it will be a damn</p><p>3 0.83460003 <a title="1430-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-04-Is_Provisioned_IOPS_Better%3F_Yes%2C_it_Delivers_More_Consistent_and_Higher_Performance_IO.html">1398 high scalability-2013-02-04-Is Provisioned IOPS Better? Yes, it Delivers More Consistent and Higher Performance IO</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Amazon created a whole new class of service with their  Provisioned IOPS  for RDS, EBS, and DynamoDB. The idea is simple. If you want more performance, you turn a dial up. If you want less, you turn a dial down. A beautifully simple model. You pay for the performance you want, which is different than their previous cloud model, where performance varied, but you paid only for what you used. 
 
The question: Do these higher priced services really work better?
 
 Rodrigo Campos  put this question to the test (only for EBS) by running a benchmark he describes in  IOMelt Provisioned IOPS EBS Benchmark Results - December 2012 .
 
The result?  Yes,   AWS Provisioned IOPS Volumes Really Deliver More Consistent and Higher Performance IO :
  

It is clear that the provisioned IOPS EBS volumes offer a huge performance upgrade when compared to the non-optimized EBS volumes, but as data has to be spread among more underlying disks or systems, it seems that the volume is increasingly more susceptibl</p><p>4 0.83225828 <a title="1430-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-28-Howto_setup_GFS-GNBD.html">227 high scalability-2008-01-28-Howto setup GFS-GNBD</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Before you proceed make sure you have physical volume(something like /dev/sda1, /dev/sda4, etc) with no data. This is going to be the gfs volume which you will export to other nodes. It should be on the node which is going to be your gnbd server. If you dont have such volume create one using fdisk.     I used mounted gfs volume as a DOCUMENT ROOT for my Apache server nodes(Load Balanced).     I tried it on FC4 64-bit. If you plan to try it on any other distribution or 32-bit arch.. still the procedure remains same. Since I built it from source but not RPMs, you may have to simply supply config options with a different CFLAGS.

<p>Introduction: Most every programmer who gets sucked into deep performance analysis for long running processes eventually realizes memory allocation is the heart of evil at the center of many of their problems. So you replace malloc with something less worse. Or you tune your garbage collector like a fineÂ ukulele. But there's a smarter approach brought to you from the folks at  RAMCloud , a Stanford University production, which is a large scale, distributed, in-memory key-value database.
 
What they've found is that typical memory management approaches don't work and using a log structured approach yields massive benefits:
  

Performance measurements of log-structured memory in RAMCloud show that it enables high client through- put at 80-90% memory utilization, even with artificially stressful workloads. In the most stressful workload, a single RAMCloud server can support 270,000-410,000 durable 100-byte writes per second at 90% memory utilization.

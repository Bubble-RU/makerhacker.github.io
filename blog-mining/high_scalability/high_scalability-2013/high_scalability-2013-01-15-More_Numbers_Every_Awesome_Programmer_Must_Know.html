Update 6:   Stock Traders Find Speed Pays, in Milliseconds . Goldman Sachs is making record profits off a  500 millisecond  trading advantage. Yes, latency matters. As an interesting aside, Libet found 500 msecs is about the time it takes the brain to weave together an experience of consciousness from all our sensor inputs.

<p>Introduction: Likewise the current belief that, in the case of artificial machines the very large and the very small are equally feasible and lasting is a manifest error. Thus, for example, a small obelisk or column or other solid figure can certainly be laid down or set up without danger of breaking, while the large ones will go to pieces under the slightest provocation, and that purely on account of their own weight. -- Galileo  
Galileo observed how things broke if they were naively scaled up. Interestingly, Google noticed a similar pattern when building larger software systems using the same techniques used to build smaller systems. 
 
 Luiz André Barroso , Distinguished Engineer at Google, talks about this fundamental property of scaling systems in his fascinating talk,  Warehouse-Scale Computing: Entering the Teenage Decade . Google found the larger the scale the greater the impact of latency variability.

  If you could harness the  power of the multiverse  you could try every possible option in the design space and see which worked best. But that's crazy impractical, isn't it?

<p>Introduction: Computing pioneer  Grace Hopper ,  inventor of the compiler , searched for a concrete way to create an intuitive understanding of just how fast is a nanosecond, a billionth of a second, which was the speed of their new computer circuits. As an illustration she settled on the length of wire that is as long as light can travel in one nanosecond. The length is a very portable  11.8 inches . A microseconds worth of wire is a still portable, but a much bulkier 984 feet. In one millisecond light travels 186 miles, which only Hercules could carry. In today's terms, at a  3.06 GHz clock speed , there's .33 nanoseconds between ticks, or 3.73 inches of light travel.
 
Understanding the profligate ways of programmers, she suggests that every programmer wear a necklace of a microseconds worth of wire so they know what they are wasting when they throw away microseconds. And if a General is busting your chops about satellite messages taking too long to send, you can bust out your piece of wire and e</p><p>6 0.15747169 <a title="1387-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-09-In_Memory%3A_Grace_Hopper_to_Programmers%3A_Mind_Your_Nanoseconds%21.html">1560 high scalability-2013-12-09-In Memory: Grace Hopper to Programmers: Mind Your Nanoseconds!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: "It’s all a numbers game – the dirty little secret of scalable systems" 
      
 Martin Thompson  is a High Performance Computing Specialist with a real mission to teach programmers how to understand the innards of modern computing systems. He has many talks and classes (listed below) on caches, buffers, memory controllers, processor architectures, cache lines, etc.
 
His thought is programmers do not put a proper value on understanding how the underpinnings of our systems work. We gravitate to the shiny and trendy. His approach is not to teach people specific programming strategies, but to teach programmers to fish so they can feed themselves. Without a real understanding strategies are easy to apply wrongly.  It's strange how programmers will put a lot of effort into understanding complicated frameworks like Hibernate, but little effort into understanding the underlying hardware on which their programs run.
 
A major tenant of Martin's approach is to "lead by experimental observation</p><p>3 0.81140149 <a title="1387-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-26-Google_Pro_Tip%3A_Use_Back-of-the-envelope-calculations_to_Choose_the_Best_Design.html">978 high scalability-2011-01-26-Google Pro Tip: Use Back-of-the-envelope-calculations to Choose the Best Design</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hey, it's HighScalability time: 
  
 The Herokulypse. A cautionary tale of what can happen when scalability is left for later. Rap Genius created quite a stir ( reddit ,  Hacker News )  when they documented  high costs ($20K/month for 15 million monthly uniques) and poor performance (6 second average response times) using Heroku's  random routing mesh . The cause was tracked to queuing at the dyno level when the expectation was requests are routed to free dynos. Heroku admits  this is a problem . So poor load balancing combined with RoR single threading = poor performance, one that adding more dynos and spending more money won't necessarily help. While it seems clear Heroku didn't make this aspect of their system crystal clear, the incident has generated a lot of teaching moments, if you slog through it all. This is a developing story.

<p>Introduction: Colin Scott   , a Berkeley researcher, updated Jeff Dean’s famous    Numbers Everyone Should Know    with his    Latency Numbers Every Programmer Should Know    interactive graphic. The interactive aspect is cool because it has a slider that let’s you see numbers back from as early as 1990 to the far far future of 2020.  
 
Colin explained his  motivation for updating the numbers :
  The other day, a friend mentioned a latency number to me, and I realized that it was an order of magnitude smaller than what I had memorized from Jeff’s talk. The problem, of course, is that hardware performance increases exponentially! After some digging, I actually found that the numbers Jeff quotes are over a decade old

<p>Introduction: Mather Corgan, president of HotPads,  gave a great talk  on how HotPads uses AWS to run their real estate search engine. I loved the presentation for a few reasons:
  It gives real costs on on their servers, how many servers they have, what they are used for, and exactly how they use S2, EBS, CloudFront and other AWS services. This is great information for anybody trying to architect a system and wondering where to run it.    HotPads is a "real" application. It's a small company and at 4.5 million page-views/month it's large but not super large. It has custom server side components like indexing engines, image processing, and background database update engines for syncing new real estate data. And it also stores a lot of images and has low latency requirements.   This a really good example mix of where many companies are or would like to be with their applications.   Their total costs are about $11K/month, which is about what they were paying at their previous provider.

<p>Introduction: Hey guys,  There is a renewed push at my organization to deploy vmware...everywhere.  I am rather excited as I know we have a lot of waste when it comes to resources.  What has pricked my ears up however, is the notion of using this technology in our very busy public facing DMZ's.  Today we get lots of spikes of traffic and we are coping very well.  40x HP blades, apache/php/perl/tomcat/ all in HA behind HA F5's and HA Checkpoint FW's.  (20 servers in 2 datacentres).  The idea is, we virtualise these machines, including the firewalls onto hosts vmware clusters that span the public interface to our internal networks.  This is something that has gone against the #1 rule I have ever lived by while working on the inet.  No airgaps from the unknown to the known!  I am interested in feedback on this scenario.  From a resource perspective, our resource requirements in the DMZ will be lowered over time due to business change and we still have a lot of head room in our capacity.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest a post by Alvaro Videla describing their architecture for  Poppen.de , a popular German dating site. This site is very much NSFW, so be careful before clicking on the link. What I found most interesting is how they manage to sucessfully blend a little of the old with a little of the new, using technologies like Nginx, MySQL, CouchDB, and Erlang, Memcached, RabbitMQ, PHP, Graphite, Red5, and Tsung.
  What is Poppen.de?  
Poppen.de (NSFW) is the top dating website in  Germany, and while it may be a small site compared to giants like Flickr  or Facebook, we believe it's a nice architecture to learn from if you  are starting to get some scaling problems.
  The  Stats   
 2.000.000 users 
 20.000  concurrent users 
 300.000 private messages per day 
 250.000  logins per day 
 We have a team  of  eleven developers, two designers and two sysadmins for this project. 
   Business Model  
The site works with a  freemium model, where users can do for free things like:

<p>Introduction: Update 6:  Some interesting changes from Twitter's  Evan Weaver : everything in RAM now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability; switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them locally.  Update 5:   Twitter on Scala . A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners.

<p>Introduction: I'm not sure what I was expecting the stack  GOV.UK used at launch  to look like. Maybe some messenger owls and lots of cobwebs? But not so at all. So much not so I thought any organization looking at their own stack for ideas could learn something from the considered choices of others.
 
The diversity of technologies used was surprising. They use "at least five different programming languages, three separate database types, two versions of an operating system." Some may think of this as a weakness, but they think it a strength:
  

The reason we operate such a diverse ecosystem is that we are focused on solving real problems. Our first task is to understand the problem or need we are solving and then to choose the best tool for the job. If we restrict ourselves to moulding the need to the tools we already have, then we risk not solving the initial problem in the best way possible for the user.

<p>Introduction: I know people are always interested in what others are using to build their systems.  Alex Payne , CTO of the new startup  BankSimple , gives us a quick hit on their toolchain choices in this  Quora thread . BankSimple positions itself as a customer-focused alternative to online banking. You may remember Alex from the  early days of Twitter . Alex was always helpful to me on Twitter's programmer support list, so I really wish them well. Alex is also a bit of an outside the box thinker, which is reflected in some of their choices:   
 
 The JVM acts as a convergence platform for these languages:           
 
  Scala  - ideal for writing performance-sensitive components that need the safety and expressiveness of the language's advanced type system. 
  Clojure  - rapidly prototype in a more dynamic language while still offering the benefits of functional programming. 
  JRuby  - makes available a bunch of great libraries and frameworks for doing frontend web development, like Rails and Pa</p><p>3 0.76028472 <a title="1469-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-21-Product%3A_Capistrano_-_Automate_Remote_Tasks_Via_SSH.html">255 high scalability-2008-02-21-Product: Capistrano - Automate Remote Tasks Via SSH</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:   Deployment with Capistrano   by Charles Max Wood.  Nice simple step-by-step for using Capistrano for deployment.
 
From their website:   Simply put,  Capistrano  is a tool for automating tasks on one or more remote servers. It executes commands in parallel on all targeted machines, and provides a mechanism for rolling back changes across multiple machines. It is ideal for anyone doing any kind of system administration, either professionally or incidentally.  *  Great for automating tasks via SSH on remote servers, like software installation, application deployment, configuration management, ad hoc server monitoring, and more. * Ideal for system administrators, whether professional or incidental. * Easy to customize. Its configuration files use the Ruby programming language syntax, but you don't need to know Ruby to do most things with Capistrano. * Easy to extend. Capistrano is written in the Ruby programming language, and may be extended easily by writing additional Ruby mod</p><p>4 0.72644329 <a title="1469-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-25-Product%3A_Puppet_the_Automated_Administration_System.html">429 high scalability-2008-10-25-Product: Puppet the Automated Administration System</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:   Digg on their choice and use of Puppet . They chose puppet over cfengine, and bcfg2 because they liked Puppet's resource abstraction layer (RAL), the ability to implement configuration management incrementally, support for bundles, and the overall design philosophy.   Puppet  implements a declarative (what not how) configuration language for automating common administration tasks. It's the system every large site writes for themselves and it's already made for you! Ilike was able to "easily" scale from  0 to hundreds of servers  using Puppet. I can't believe I've never seen this before. It looks really cool. What is Puppet and how can it help you scale your website operations?
   
 From the Puppet website:   Puppet has been developed to help the sysadmin community move to building and sharing mature tools that avoid the duplication of everyone solving the same problem. It does so in two ways: * It provides a powerful framework to simplify the majority of the technical tasks t</p><p>5 0.72441918 <a title="1469-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-21-Using_Google_AppEngine_for_a_Little_Micro-Scalability.html">307 high scalability-2008-04-21-Using Google AppEngine for a Little Micro-Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Over the years I've accumulated quite a rag tag collection of personal systems scattered wide across a galaxy of different servers. For the past month I've been on a quest to rationalize this conglomeration by moving everything to a managed service of one kind or another. The goal: lift a load of worry from my mind. I like to do my own stuff my self so I learn something and have control. Control always comes with headaches and it was time for a little aspirin. As part of the process GAE came in handy as a host for a few Twitter related scripts I couldn't manage to run  anywhere else. I recoded my simple little scripts into Python/GAE and learned a lot in the process.       In the move I exported HighScalability from a VPS and imported it into a shared hosting service. I could never quite configure Apache and MySQL well enough that they wouldn't spike memory periodically and crash the VPS. And since a memory crash did not automatically restarted it was unacceptable. I also wrote a scrip</p><p>6 0.72090858 <a title="1469-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-18-Ansible_-__A_Simple_Model-Driven_Configuration_Management_and_Command_Execution_Framework.html">1230 high scalability-2012-04-18-Ansible -  A Simple Model-Driven Configuration Management and Command Execution Framework</a></p>

<p>Introduction: An Analysis of Linux Scalability to Many Cores , by a number of MIT researchers, is a refreshingly practical paper on what it takes to scale Linux and common applications like Exim, memcached, Apache, PostgreSQL, gmake, Psearchy, and MapReduce to run on 48 core systems. A very timely paper given moderately massive multicore systems are reportedly the near future of computing.
 
This paper must have taken a lot of work. They both tracked down bottlenecks in a number of applications and the Linux kernel and they also tried to fix them. Modestly speaking the authors said they made "modest" changes to the kernel and applications, but there's nothing modest about what they did. It's excellent work.
 
After the next bit, which is the abstract, there is a list of the problems they found and how they fixed them.

You have to have complete fluidity with the storage tier, the web tier. We are running our own data centers. We are looking more at doing our own data centers with more of a private cloud.

</p><p>2 The depth of his knowledge in all phases of the restaurant business is immediately apparent as he methodically works to fix what's broken. [sent-15, score-0.536]
</p><p>3 Apparently if, you run it right, a restaurant can make a lot of money. [sent-19, score-0.536]
</p><p>4 That's what attracts people to a restaurant and keeps them coming back. [sent-25, score-0.613]
</p><p>5 It's great fun to watch Ramsay cuss and cajole his way through the entire restaurant staff putting his finger directly on problems, creating inspired solutions, and then mentoring the staff and owners through the transformations needed to become a good restaurant. [sent-32, score-0.731]
</p><p>6 While watching you have to wonder how people who invested their life savings in a restaurant could be so screwed up. [sent-33, score-0.648]
</p><p>7 Running a restaurant is hard and it's oh so easy to get in a rut. [sent-36, score-0.536]
</p><p>8 And on TV you see Ramsay slap the electroshock paddles on the restaurant and bring it back to life. [sent-43, score-0.577]
</p><p>9 It's wondrous to see both the restaurant and the people come back to life. [sent-44, score-0.654]
</p><p>10 What's fun is when Ramsay revisits the restaurant after six or so weeks to see how the restaurant is doing. [sent-45, score-1.072]
</p><p>11 Instead, Ramsay taught them the principles of running a restaurant and then they learned how to apply the principles to their own situation. [sent-49, score-0.571]
</p><p>12 Sometimes on Ramsay's reinspection tour he finds the restaurant has closed down or isn't doing as well as you might expect. [sent-50, score-0.536]
</p><p>13 One guy made a bad deal on a lease so it didn't matter in the end if the restaurant improved or not. [sent-53, score-0.639]
</p><p>14 An example of this scenario was a fancy French restaurant where the owner gave the chef total control to cook whatever he wanted. [sent-55, score-0.96]
</p><p>15 It turns out the chef was addicted to complex foods that prevented the restaurant from getting its Michelin star. [sent-56, score-0.727]
</p><p>16 Here are some of the notes I took on Ramsay's restaurant turn around strategies. [sent-60, score-0.536]

</p><p>18 The best investment a restaurant owner can make is a great head chef. [sent-68, score-0.635]

<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble in an often poignant   FriendFeed thread   commiserating PodTech's unfortunate end, shared what he learned about creating a successful startup. Here's a summary of a Robert's rules and why Machiavelli just may agree with them:       Have a story.   Have everyone on board with that story.   If anyone goes off of that story, make sure they get on board immediately or fire them.   Make sure people are judged by the revenues they bring in. Those that bring in revenues should get to run the place. People who don't bring in revenues should get fewer and fewer responsibilities, not more and more.   Work ONLY for a leader who will make the tough decisions.   Build a place where excellence is expected, allowed, and is enabled.   Fire idiots quickly.

<p>Introduction: Om proposes one solution to the   Twitter Problem   is to   limit followers   to three square meals a day. The reasonable idea being that lower limits should mean fewer scaling problems. And as a kicker raising those limits is a good way to raise much needed revenue.      Scoble thinks users should   consume without limit   and will drive to another buffet if all-you-can-eat privileges are revoked. The reasonable idea being that if an internet service can't solve internet scale problems then there's not much use for it.      Dave says   comp power users a top floor suite   and shower them with free passes to the buffet. Let the good times roll! The reasonable idea being that power users help create popular restaurants, er, services in the first place and limiting them starves users and starved users won't come back.     So, should web services like Twitter be a buffet, a fixed eight course fine dining experience, a small plate restaurant, a family style joint, or a vending machine?

My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.   The trip was more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system, listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of fellow riders.

Would I use it if I were new to a project? Would programmers working on the project use it?  
I'll rephrase their question to more conveniently express a point I've thought a lot about:  Why do companies put so little effort into automating their own development process to make development easier? 
 
It's like the hair stylist whose own hair looks like someone cut it using a late night infomercial vacuum cleaner attachment. Or it's like the interior decorator whose own house looks like a monk's cell.
 
Software organizations rarely build software to make developing software easier. Why is that?
        Because there are three ways changes are made in an organization:

<p>Introduction: Imagine if you will that car rental agencies rented cars like programmers are hired at many software companies...   Agency  : So sorry you had to wait in the reception area for an hour. Nobody knew you were coming to today. I finally found 8 people to interview before we can rent you a car. If we like you you may have to come in for another round of interviews tomorrow because our manager isn't in today. I didn't have a chance to read your application, so I'll just start with a question. What car do you drive today?  Applicant  : I drive a 2008 Subaru.  Agency  : That's a shame. We don't have a Subaru to rent you.  Applicant  : That's OK. Any car will do.  Agency  : No, we can only take on clients who know how to drive the cars we stock. We find it's safer that way. There are so many little differences between cars, we just don't want to take a chance.  Applicant  : I have a drivers license. I know how to drive. I've been driving all kinds of cars for 15 years, I am sure I can adapt.</p><p>6 0.85268396 <a title="1500-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-16-Scaling_Traffic%3A_People_Pod_Pool_of_On_Demand_Self_Driving_Robotic_Cars_who_Automatically_Refuel_from_Cheap_Solar.html">657 high scalability-2009-07-16-Scaling Traffic: People Pod Pool of On Demand Self Driving Robotic Cars who Automatically Refuel from Cheap Solar</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This scalability strategy is brought to you by Erik Osterman:   My recommendations for anyone dealing with explosive growth on a limited budget with lots of cachable content (e.g. content capable of returning valid expiration headers) is employ a    reverse proxy    as mentioned in this article.   In the last week, we had a site get AP'd, triggering 100K unique visitors to a single IIS server in under 5 hours. It took out the IIS server. Placing a single squid infront of the server handled the entire onslaught with a max server load of 0.10 on a modest Intel IV 3Ghz.  It's trivial to implement for anyone interested...</p><p>3 0.93396854 <a title="1500-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-06-Product%3A_ChironFS.html">143 high scalability-2007-11-06-Product: ChironFS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are trying to create highly available file systems, especially across data centers,  then ChironFS is one potential solution. It's relatively new, so there aren't lots of experience reports, but it looks worth considering. What is  ChironFS  and how does it work?
 
Adapted from the ChironFS website:   The Chiron Filesystem is a Fuse based filesystem that frees you from single points of failure. It's main purpose is to guarantee filesystem availability using replication. But it isn't a RAID implementation. RAID replicates DEVICES not FILESYSTEMS.  Why not just use RAID over some network block device? Because it is a block device and if one server mounts that device in RW mode, no other server will be able to mount it in RW mode. Any real network may have many servers and offer a variety of services. Keeping everything running can become a real nightmare!</p><p>4 0.93081135 <a title="1500-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-23-Synchronizing_Memcached_application.html">191 high scalability-2007-12-23-Synchronizing Memcached application</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Sequoia  is a transparent middleware solution offering clustering, load balancing and failover services for any database. Sequoia is the continuation of the C-JDBC project. The database is distributed and replicated among several nodes and Sequoia balances the queries among these nodes. Sequoia handles node and network failures with transparent failover. It also provides support for hot recovery, online maintenance operations and online upgrades.
  Features in a nutshell    No modification of existing applications or databases.    Operational with any database providing a JDBC driver.    High availability provided by advanced RAIDb technology.    Transparent failover and recovery capabilities.    Performance scalability with unique load balancing and query result caching features.    Integrated JMX-based administration and monitoring.    100% Java implementation allowing portability across platforms with a JRE 1.4 or greater.    Open source licensed under Apache v2 license.

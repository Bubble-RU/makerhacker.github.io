<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Eric Czech, Chief Architect at Next Big Sound, talks
about some unique approaches taken to solving scalability challenges in music
analytics.Tracking online activity is hardly a new idea, but doing it for the
entire music industry isn't easy. Half a billion music video streams, track
downloads, and artist page likes occur each day and measuring all of this
activity across platforms such as Spotify, iTunes, YouTube, Facebook, and
more, poses some interesting scalability challenges. Next Big Sound collects
this type of data from over a hundred sources, standardizes everything, and
offers that information to record labels, band managers, and artists through a
web-based analytics platform.While many of our applications use open-source
systems like Hadoop, HBase, Cassandra, Mongo, RabbitMQ, and MySQL, our usage
is fairly standard, but there is one aspect of what we do that is pretty
unique. We collect or receive information from 100+ sources and we struggled

<p>Introduction: Skype's 220 millions users lost service for a stunning two days. The primary
cause for Skype's nightmare (can you imagine the beeper storm that went off?)
was a massive global roll-out of aWindow's patchtriggering the simultaneous
reboot of millions of machines across the globe. The secondary cause was a bug
in Skype's software that prevented "self-healing" in the face of such attacks.
The flood of log-in requests and a lack of "peer-to-peer resources" melted
their system.breakWho's fault is it? Is Skype to blame? Is Microsoft to blame?
Or is the peer-to-peer model itself fundamentally flawed in some way?Let's be
real, how could Skype possibly test booting 220 million servers over a random
configuration of resources? Answer: they can't. Yes, it's Skype's
responsibility, but they are in a bit of a pickle on this one.The boot
scenario is one of the most basic and one of the most difficult scalability
scenarios to plan for and test. You can't simulate the viciousness of real-

<p>Introduction: If you've wondered why I haven't been posting lately it's because I've been on
an amazingBeach's motorcycle tourof theAlps(and,and,and,and,and,and,and,and).
My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.The trip was
more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after
mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent
Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling
local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the
winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system,
listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank
water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local
German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of
fellow riders. Magical.They say you'll ride more twists and turns on this trip

<p>Introduction: The story of driving thegolden spiketo symbolize the completion of
thetranscontinental railroad is famous in the US. What is not so well known is
the story of how it also foreshadowed changes to come as an early version of
both the Internet and the Internet of Things. But that was 1869, how can that
possibly be?Telegraph as InternetFirst, let's establish the telegraph and
cable systems was an early version of an Internet.As railroad tracks were
being laid atranscontental telegraphsystem was also being constructed.
Telegraph lines were installed parallel to the tracks making instant
communication available across the continent, faster than any horse could
ride.With the transalantic cable system information could quickly span
continents in minutes:The miles of American telegraph grew from 40 in 1846 to
12,000 in 1850 to 23,000 in 1852. In Europe it increased from 2,000 in 1849 to
110,000 in 1869. The cost of sending 10 words was $1.55 in 1850, $1 in 1870,

<p>Introduction: Over the years I've read a lot of research papers looking for better ways of
doing things. Sometimes I find ideas I can use, but more often than not I come
up empty. The problem is there are very few good papers. And by good I mean:
can a reasonably intelligent person read a paper and turn it into something
useful? Now, clearly I'm not an academic and clearly I'm no genius, I'm just
an everyday programmer searching for leverage, and as a common specimen of the
species I've often thought how much better our industry would be if we could
simply move research from academia into production with some sort of self-
conscious professionalism. Currently the process is horribly hit or miss. And
this problem extends equally to companies with research divisions that often
do very little to help front-line developers succeed. How many ideas break out
of academia into industry in computer science? We have many brilliant
examples: encryption, microprocessors, compression, transactions, distributed

<p>Introduction: I am in no way a music expert, but when I listen toSymphony No. 4byCharles
Ives, I imagine it's what a complex software/hardware system might sound like
if we could hear its inner workings. Ives uses a lot of riotously competing
rhythms in this work. It can sound discordant, yet the effect is deeply
layered and eventually harmonious, just like the systems we use, create, and
become part of.I was pointed to this piece by someone who said there were two
conductors. I'd never heard of such a thing! So I was intrigued. The first
version of the performance sounds and looks great, but it unfortunately does
not use two conductors. The second version uses two conductors, but is
unfortunately just a snippet.It's strikingly odd to see two conductors, but I
imagine different parts of our systems using different conductors too, running
at different rhythms, sometimes slow, sometimes fast, sometimes there are
outbursts, sometimes in vicious conflict. Yet conceptually it all stills seems
to hang tog</p><p>2 0.62059224 <a title="1422-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-09-6_Scalability_Lessons.html">898 high scalability-2010-09-09-6 Scalability Lessons</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jesper Soderlund not only put together a few interesting scalability patterns,
he also came up with a few interesting scalability lessons:Lesson #1. Put
Smarty compile and template caches on an active-active DRBD cluster with high
load and your servers will DIE!Lesson #2. Don't use out-of-the-box
configurations.Lesson #3. Single points of contention will eventually become a
bottleneck.Lesson #4. Plan in advance. Lesson #5. Offload your databases as
much as possible.Lesson #6. File systems matter and can run out of space /
inodes.For more details and explanations see the original post.</p><p>3 0.52521741 <a title="1422-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-08-Riak_-_web-shaped_data_storage_system.html">718 high scalability-2009-10-08-Riak - web-shaped data storage system</a></p>

Some of the features it offers are:Document-orientedScalable, decentralized
key-value storeStandard get, put, and delete operations. Distributed, fault-
tolerant storage solution.Configurable levels of consistency, availability,
and partition toleranceSupport for Erlang, Ruby, PHP, Javascript, Java,
Python, HTTP open source and NoSQLPluggable backendsEventing
systemMonitoringInter-cluster replicationLinks between records that can be
traversed.Map/Reduce. Functions are executed on the data node. One interesting
difference is that a list keys are required to specify which values are
operated on as apposed to running calculations on all values. Related

<p>Introduction: Discois an open-source implementation of the MapReduce framework for
distributed computing. It was started atNokia Research Centeras a lightweight
framework for rapid scripting of distributed data processing tasks. The Disco
core is written in Erlang. The MapReduce jobs in Disco are natively described
as Python programs, which makes it possible to express complex algorithmic and
data processing tasks often only in tens of lines of code.</p><p>5 0.43113995 <a title="1422-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-09-Clustering_Solution.html">86 high scalability-2007-09-09-Clustering Solution</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,I'minterested in peoples thoughts on the best choice for a database
clustering solution.I have a database that is mostly varchars and numbers that
doesn't store any binary data at all. It's used at about 70% read and 30%
writes - though we're using memcached at the moment so it's not really hit
that hard.We're currently using mysql with m/cluster, but are interested in a
new solution. Possible candidate so far are unicluster (which doesn't seem
mature yet.) or DRBD.Had anyone had a similar experience and can make any
suggestions?Thanks</p><p>6 0.40086371 <a title="1422-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-08-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_November_8th%2C_2013.html">1545 high scalability-2013-11-08-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For November 8th, 2013</a></p>

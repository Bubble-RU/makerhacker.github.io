<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-

<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's
discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon
organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable
systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the
ACM Queue article have also been included.Amazon grew from a tiny online
bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering
new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.How do you scale anAWS(Amazon Web Services) infrastructure?
This article will give you a detailed reply in two parts: the tools you can
use to make the most of Amazon's dynamic approach, and the architectural model
you should adopt for a scalable infrastructure.I base my report on my
experience gained in several AWS production projects in casual gaming
(Facebook), e-commerce infrastructures and within the mainstream GIS
(Geographic Information System). It's true that my experience in gaming
(IsCool, The Game) is currently the most representative in terms of
scalability, due to the number of users (over 800 thousand DAU - daily active
users - at peak usage and over 20 million page views every day), however my
experiences in e-commerce and GIS (currently underway) provide a different
view of scalability, taking into account the various problems of availability
and data management.

Ruby code were upgraded and virtualization was removed. The result:A 66 %
reduction in the response time while handling multiples of the traffic is

their favorite (fast, efficient, graceful configuration, queues requests when
Mongrels are busy) for spreading dynamic content between Apache web servers
and Mongrel application servers.Update 4:O'Rielly's Tim O'Brien

<p>Introduction: ThePort Network's Director of Engineering, TJ Muehleman was kind of enough to
share some of the architectural details for their white label social media
system. It currently runs about 50 social networks varying in size from less
than 1000 members to more than 300,000 members, all on a Microsoft stack. In
addition to their social networking platform, they offer Javascript APIs and
web service APIs (both REST and SOAP) which account for a significant
percentage of overall system usage.ThePort is an excellent example of a real
world in-the-trenches product offering real value to customers. One of the
most interesting problems they have to solve is multi-tenancy. How do you
provide good performance, complete customization, support, develop new
features, and provide individual search indexes for each customer? It's not an
easy problem to solve.How did they solve their problems and build a successful
system? Site: http://theport.comPlatformMicrosoft.NET 3.5C# / VB.NETSQL Server

<p>Introduction: This is a part interview part guest with Sebastian Stadil, founder ofScalr, a
cheaper open-source version of RightScale. Scalr takes care of all the web
site infrastructure bits to on Amazon (and other clouds) so you don't have
to.I first met Sebastian at one of the original Silicon Valley Cloud Computing
Group meetups, a group which he founded. The meetings started in the tiny
offices of Intalio where Sebastian was working with this new fangled Amazon
thing to create an auto-scaling server farm on EC2. I remember distinctly how
Sebastian met everyone at the door with a handshake and a smile, making us all
feel welcome. Later I took one of the classes he created on how to use AWS. I
guess he figured all this cloud stuff was going somewhere and decided to start
Scalr.My only regret about this post is that the name Amazon does not begin
with the letter 'S', that would have made for an epic title.Getting to Know

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Marcel Panse and Sander Nagtegaal from Peecho.Although
architecture descriptions are an interesting read, the problems that start-ups
face are hardly ever addressed. We would like to change that, so here is our
architecture story.Introducing a start-upThe Amsterdam-based
companyPeechooffers print-as-a-service. Our embeddableprint buttonallows you
to sell your digital content as professionally printed products, like photo

API, too.Printcloud is the system that powers the print button. It exists in
the cloud only, growing when needed and becoming smaller if it can. The system
takes in print orders, magically transforms tough data into print-ready files
and routes the orders to the production facility that is closest to the
intended recipient.To preserve the environment, Peecho's philosophy is to
facilitate global ordering, but to aim for local production only.Expensive

<p>Introduction: Several readers had follow-up questions in response to this article. Luke's
responses can be found inHow FarmVille Scales - The Follow-up.If real farming
was as comforting as it is inZynga's mega-hit Farmvillethen my family would
have probably never left those harsh North Dakota winters. None of the scary
bedtime stories my Grandma used to tell about farming are true in
FarmVille.Farmersmake money, plants grow, and animals never visit thered barn.
I guess it's just that keep-your-shoes-clean back-to-the-land charm that has
helped make FarmVille the "largest game in the world" in such an astonishingly
short time.How did FarmVille scale a web application to handle 75 million
players a month? Fortunately FarmVille's Luke Rajlich has agreed to let us in
on a few their challenges and secrets. Here's what Luke has to say...The

<p>Introduction: This article is a lightly edited version of 20 Obstacles to Scalability bySean
Hull (with permission) from the always excellent and thought provoking ACM
Queue.1. TWO-PHASE COMMITNormally when data is changed in a database, it is
written both to memory and to disk. When a commit happens, a relational
database makes a commitment to freeze the data somewhere on real storage
media. Remember, memory doesn't survive a crash or reboot. Even if the data is
cached in memory, the database still has to write it to disk. MySQL binary
logs or Oracle redo logs fit the bill.With a MySQL cluster or distributed file
system such as DRBD (Distributed Replicated Block Device) or Amazon Multi-AZ
(Multi-Availability Zone), a commit occurs not only locally, but also at the
remote end. A two-phase commit means waiting for an acknowledgment from the
far end. Because of network and other latency, those commits can be slowed
down by milliseconds, as though all the cars on a highway were slowed down by

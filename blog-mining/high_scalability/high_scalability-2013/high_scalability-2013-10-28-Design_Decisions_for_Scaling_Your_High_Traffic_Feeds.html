</p><p>6 Introduction to Feeds   The problem of scaling feed systems has been widely discussed, but let me start by clarifying the basics. [sent-12, score-0.481]
</p><p>7 The solutions are aimed at making a page like your Facebook news feed, Twitter stream or  Fashiolista  feed work under high traffic conditions. [sent-13, score-0.541]
</p><p>8 There are two strategies for building feed systems:         Pull , where the feed is gathered during reads        Push  where all the feeds are pre computed during the writes. [sent-17, score-1.145]

</p><p>11 Fashiolista currently does a full push flow for the flat feed and a combination between push and pull for the aggregated feed. [sent-45, score-0.588]
</p><p>12 When the time comes for building your own feed system (hopefully using Feedly) there are a few important design decisions to consider. [sent-50, score-0.541]
</p><p>13 The feed with the activities by people you follow either contains the ids of the activities (normalized) or the full activity (denormalized). [sent-53, score-1.092]
</p><p>14 It makes a huge difference if you are building a notification system   or a news feed system. [sent-57, score-0.619]

<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.    We're basically using a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget). Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text, author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.    I'm wondering if we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to g</p><p>3 0.22827712 <a title="1538-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-05-Quick_question_about_efficiently_implementing_Facebook_%27news_feed%27_like_functionality.html">141 high scalability-2007-11-05-Quick question about efficiently implementing Facebook 'news feed' like functionality</a></p>

So what am I m  i  ssing? How do you think Facebook is imp  l  ementing their "news feed".

<p>Introduction: How do you scale an inbox that has multiple highly volatile feeds? That's a problem faced by social networks like Tumblr, Facebook, and Twitter. Follow a few hundred event sources and it's hard to scalably order an inbox so that you see a correct view as event sources continually publish new events.
 
This can be considered like a  view materialization  problem in a database. In a database a view is a virtual table defined by a query that can be accessed like a table. Materialization refers to when the data behind the view is created. If a view is a join on several tables and that join is performed when the view is accessed, then performance will be slow. If the view is precomputed access to the view will be fast, but more resources are used, especially considering that the view may never be accessed.
 
Your wall/inbox/stream is a view on all the people/things you follow. If you never look at your inbox then materializing the view in your inbox is a waste of resources, yet you'll be ma</p><p>5 0.17354774 <a title="1538-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-11-Building_a_Social_Music_Service_Using_AWS%2C_Scala%2C_Akka%2C_Play%2C_MongoDB%2C_and_Elasticsearch.html">1609 high scalability-2014-03-11-Building a Social Music Service Using AWS, Scala, Akka, Play, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a  guest repost  by  Rotem Hermon , former Chief Architect for  serendip.me , on the architecture and scaling considerations behind making a startup music service. 
 
 serendip.me  is a social music service that helps people discover great music shared by their friends, and also introduces them to their “music soulmates” - people outside their immediate social circle that shares a similar taste in music.
 
Serendip is running on AWS and is built on the following stack:  scala  (and some Java),  akka  (for handling concurrency),  Play framework  (for the web and API front-ends),  MongoDB  and  Elasticsearch .
  Choosing the stack  
One of the challenges of building serendip was the need to handle a large amount of data from day one, since a main feature of serendip is that it collects  every piece of music being shared on Twitter  from public music services. So when we approached the question of choosing the language and technologies to use, an important consideration was the ab</p><p>6 0.15874696 <a title="1538-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-16-Instagram_Architecture_Update%3A_What%E2%80%99s_new_with_Instagram%3F.html">1228 high scalability-2012-04-16-Instagram Architecture Update: What’s new with Instagram?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In  How to take advantage of Redis just adding it to your stack  Salvatore 'antirez' Sanfilippo shows how to solve some common problems in Redis by taking advantage of its unique data structure handling capabilities. Common Redis primitives like LPUSH, and LTRIM, and LREM are used to accomplish tasks programmers need to get done, but that can be hard or slow in more traditional stores. A very useful and practical article. How would you accomplish these tasks in your framework?
  
  Show latest items listings in your home page . This is a live in-memory cache and is very fast.  LPUSH  is used to insert a content ID at the head of the list stored at a key.  LTRIM  is used to limit the number of items in the list to 5000. If the user needs to page beyond this cache only then are they sent to the database. 
  Deletion and filtering . If a cached article is deleted it can be removed from the cache using  LREM .

A leader board is a set sorted by score.</p><p>3 0.81145197 <a title="1538-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-19-Product%3A_Redis_-_Not_Just_Another_Key-Value_Store.html">545 high scalability-2009-03-19-Product: Redis - Not Just Another Key-Value Store</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With the introduction of  Redis  your options in the key-value space just grew and your choice of which to pick just got a lot harder. But when you think about it, that's not a bad position to be in at all.  Redis (REmote DIctionary Server) -  a key-value database. It's similar to memcached but the dataset is not volatile, and values can be strings, exactly like in memcached, but also lists and sets with atomic operations to push/pop elements.   The key points are: open source; speed (benchmarked performing 110,000 SET operations, and 81,000 GETs, per second); persistence, but in an asynchronous way taking everything in memory; support for higher level data structures and atomic operations.  The home page is well organized so I'll spare the excessive-copying-to-make-this-post-longer. For a good overview of Redis take a look at Antonio Cangiano's article:  Introducing Redis: a fast key-value database .

I'm wondering if we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to g</p><p>5 0.78340119 <a title="1538-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-16-A_Super_Short_on_the_Youporn_Stack_-_300K_QPS_and_100_Million_Page_Views_Per_Day.html">1194 high scalability-2012-02-16-A Super Short on the Youporn Stack - 300K QPS and 100 Million Page Views Per Day</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Eric Pickup from Youporn.com posted on a  news group  that Youporn is now 100% Redis based and will soon be revealing more about their architecture at the  ConFoo conference . Some stunning, but not surprising numbers were revealed:
  
 
 100 million page views per day 
 A cluster of Redis slaves are handling over 300k queries per second. 
 
  
Some additional nuggets:
  
 Additional Redis nodes were added because the network cards couldn't keep up with Redis. 
 Impressed with Redis' performance. 
 All reads come from Redis;  we are maintaining MySQL just to allow us to build new sorted sets as our requirement change 
 Most data is found in hashes with ordered sets used to know what data to show.   
 
 A typical lookup would be an zInterStore on: videos:filters:released, Videos:filters:orientation:straight,Videos:filters:categories:{category_id}, Videos:ordering:rating 
 Then perform a zRange to get the pages we want and get the list of video_ids back.

 Update 6:   NoSQL : If Only it Was that Easy . BJ Clark lays down the law on which databases are scalable: Tokyo - NO, Redis - NO, Voldemort - YES, MongoDB - Not Yet, Cassandra - Probably, Amazon S3 - YES * 2, MySQL - NO.  The real thing to point out is that if you are being held back from making something super awesome because you can’t choose a database, you are doing it wrong.

<p>Introduction: Guest post by Thierry Schellenbach, Founder/CTO of Fashiolista.com, follow @tschellenbach on Twitter and Github 
 
 Fashiolista  started out as a hobby project which we built on the side. We had absolutely no idea it would grow into one of the largest online fashion communities. The entire first version took about two weeks to develop and our feed implementation was dead simple. We’ve come a long way since then and I’d like to share our experience with scaling feed systems.
 
Feeds are a core component of many large startups such as Pinterest, Instagram, Wanelo and Fashiolista. At Fashiolista the feed system powers the  flat feed ,  aggregated feed  and the  notification  system. This article will explain the troubles we ran into when scaling our feeds and the design decisions involved with building your own solution. Understanding the basics of how these feed systems work is essential as more and more applications rely on them.
  
 Furthermore we’ve open sourced  Feedly , the Python m</p><p>3 0.93338972 <a title="1538-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-07-Hot_Scalability_Links_For_Oct_8%2C_2010.html">916 high scalability-2010-10-07-Hot Scalability Links For Oct 8, 2010</a></p>

</p><p>5 But before we dig into the numbers lets talk about what its like to run NuoDB in the GCE. [sent-12, score-0.055]
</p><p>6 First you authenticate with gcutil auth, and through the magic of OAuth your GMail account is used to generate a password that you can cut & paste into gcutil. [sent-14, score-0.717]
</p><p>7 gcutil remembers who you are and sets up the necessary ssh credentials, so that you can log into any of your instances automatically from that machine. [sent-16, score-0.846]
</p><p>8 And better yet, when you ssh to an instance you haven't logged into before, a home directory is created for you automatically with your ssh credentials installed so you can then ssh from that machine into any of your other instances. [sent-17, score-0.721]
</p><p>9 Another thing you won't have to deal with is IP addresses, gcutil knows your instance names so instead of having to go hunting for IP addresses you just do:gcutil ssh image_nameIt's that easy. [sent-19, score-0.922]
</p><p>10 The gcutil command does all the things you'd expect: you can add, list, delete things called instances, images, firewalls, networks and disks. [sent-20, score-0.566]
</p><p>11 For those who like to see real code here's a snippet of our script to create a NuoDB GCE image:gcutil addinstance --machine_type=n1-highmem-8 \ \--image=projects/google/global/images/gcel-12-04-v20130225 \ \--service_accou nt_scopes=https://www. [sent-21, score-0.155]

</p><p>14 deb to it (GCE supports a couple different ubuntu and centos based distros), install the JRE and then install nuodb. [sent-54, score-0.152]
</p><p>15 Then the image is saved for reuse by bundling the raw disk image and uploading it to Google Storage (this is why there's that -servce_account_scopes argument to addinstance is there, it allows me to use gsutil in my instance without having to authenticate). [sent-55, score-0.605]
</p><p>16 After getting an image together we staged our benchmark by creating 32 images. [sent-57, score-0.24]
</p><p>17 From there we exploited GCE's shared read only disk feature to get our benchmark deployed to every instance and setup 1 Storage Manager (with two disks attached for atom storage and the journal) and 32 Transaction Engines. [sent-60, score-0.368]
</p><p>18 8 million transactions per secondusing our multi-client YCSB setup on workload b (5% updates) on 32 nodes. [sent-62, score-0.088]
</p><p>19 Wedid not run the test with journaling enabledbecause we're still working on getting high IO performance against a GCE virtual disk, but we'll publish those numbers soon. [sent-64, score-0.103]
</p><p>20 In the meantime let us know what your database needs are like (workload mix, record sizes, db size, etc), so we can run more benchmarks covering the right use-cases. [sent-65, score-0.096]

<p>Introduction: After poking around theGoogle Compute Engine(GCE) documentation I had some
trouble creating a mental model of how GCE works. Is it like AWS, GAE,
Rackspace, just what is it? After watchingGoogle I/O 2012 - Introducing Google
Compute EngineandGoogle Compute Engine -- Technical Details, it turns out my
initial impression, that GCE is disarmingly straightforward, turns out to be
the point.The focus of GCE is on the C, which stands for Compute, and that's
what GCE is all about: deploying lots of servers to solve computationally hard
problems. What you get with GCE is a Super Datacenter on Google Steroids.If
you are wondering how you will run the next Instagram on GCE then that would
be missing the point. GAE is targeted at applications. GCE is targeted
at:Delivering a proven, pure, high performance, high scale compute

<p>Introduction: This is a repost of part 2 (part 1) of an interviewI did for theBoundary
blog.Boundary:  There's another battle coming down the pike between Amazon
(AWS) and Google (GCE). How should the CTO decide which one's best?Hoff: Given
that GCE is still closed to public access we have very little common
experience on which to judge. The best way to decide is as always, by running
a few experiments. Pick a few representative projects, a representative team,
implement the projects on both infrastructures, crunch some numbers, figure
out the bigger picture and then select the one you wanted in the first place
.Sebastian Stadil, founder of Scalr, recently wrote about his experiences on
both platforms and found some interesting differences: AWS has a much richer
set of services; GCE is on-demand only, so AWS can be cheaper; GCE has faster
disk and faster network IO, especially between datacenters; GCE has faster
boot times and can mount read-only partitions across multiple machines; and
GCE shares i</p><p>4 0.22803077 <a title="1437-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-22-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_22%2C_2013.html">1428 high scalability-2013-03-22-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 22, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byBen BromheadfromInstaclustrDeciding to use a managed
NoSQL datastore is a great step in ensuring you run a fast, scalable and
resilient application without needing to be an expert in highly available
architecture. How do you know which technology is the best for your
application? How do you know whether the provider's performance claims are
true? You are putting your application on someone else’s infrastructure and
that requires some hard answers about their claims.To determine the
suitability of a provider, your first port of call is to benchmark. Choosing a
service provider is often done in a number of stages. First is to shortlist
providers based on capabilities and claimed performance, ruling out those that
do not meet your application requirements. Second is to look for benchmarks
conducted by third parties, if any. The final stage is to benchmark the
service yourself.In this article we will show you how to run some preliminary
benchmarks against two managed</p><p>6 0.10644325 <a title="1437-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-10-Sponsored_Post%3A_Booking%2C_Spokeo%2C_Apple%2C_NuoDB%2C_ScaleOut%2C_MongoDB%2C_BlueStripe%2C_AiScaler%2C_Aerospike%2C_New_Relic%2C_LogicMonitor%2C_AppDynamics%2C_ManageEngine%2C_Site24x7.html">1562 high scalability-2013-12-10-Sponsored Post: Booking, Spokeo, Apple, NuoDB, ScaleOut, MongoDB, BlueStripe, AiScaler, Aerospike, New Relic, LogicMonitor, AppDynamics, ManageEngine, Site24x7</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a repost of part 2 (part 1) of an interviewI did for theBoundary
blog.Boundary:  There's another battle coming down the pike between Amazon
(AWS) and Google (GCE). How should the CTO decide which one's best?Hoff: Given
that GCE is still closed to public access we have very little common
experience on which to judge. The best way to decide is as always, by running
a few experiments. Pick a few representative projects, a representative team,
implement the projects on both infrastructures, crunch some numbers, figure
out the bigger picture and then select the one you wanted in the first place
.Sebastian Stadil, founder of Scalr, recently wrote about his experiences on
both platforms and found some interesting differences: AWS has a much richer
set of services; GCE is on-demand only, so AWS can be cheaper; GCE has faster
disk and faster network IO, especially between datacenters; GCE has faster
boot times and can mount read-only partitions across multiple machines; and
GCE shares i</p><p>4 0.61564791 <a title="1437-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-22-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_22%2C_2013.html">1428 high scalability-2013-03-22-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 22, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byBen BromheadfromInstaclustrDeciding to use a managed
NoSQL datastore is a great step in ensuring you run a fast, scalable and
resilient application without needing to be an expert in highly available
architecture. How do you know which technology is the best for your
application? How do you know whether the provider's performance claims are
true? You are putting your application on someone else’s infrastructure and
that requires some hard answers about their claims.To determine the
suitability of a provider, your first port of call is to benchmark. Choosing a
service provider is often done in a number of stages. First is to shortlist
providers based on capabilities and claimed performance, ruling out those that
do not meet your application requirements. Second is to look for benchmarks
conducted by third parties, if any. The final stage is to benchmark the
service yourself.In this article we will show you how to run some preliminary
benchmarks against two managed</p><p>6 0.57494742 <a title="1437-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-07-Rumors_of_Signs_and_Portents_Concerning_Freeish_Google_Cloud.html">299 high scalability-2008-04-07-Rumors of Signs and Portents Concerning Freeish Google Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a repost of the blog entry written by NuoDB's Tommy Reilly.  We
atNuoDBwere recently given the opportunity to kick the tires on the Google
Compute Engine by our friends over at Google. You can watch the entire Google
Developer Live Session by clickinghere.  In order to access the capabilities
of GCE we decided to run the same YCSB based benchmark we ran at our General
Availability Launch back in January. For those of you who missed it we
demonstrated running the YCSB benchmark on a 24 machine cluster running on our
private cloud in the NuoDB datacenter. The salient results were 1.7 million
transactions per second with sub-millisecond latencies.Public cloud
environments typically mean virtualization, inconsistent network performance
and potentially slow or low bandwidth disk access. It just so happens that
NuoDB was designed to work well in such harsh environments (we don't call it a
cloud database for nothing). Still, the faster the CPU, network and disk the
faster the database</p><p>3 0.82365066 <a title="1437-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-10-Blog%3A_Esoteric_Curio_by_Theo_Schlossnagle.html">87 high scalability-2007-09-10-Blog: Esoteric Curio by Theo Schlossnagle</a></p>

intervals is not a good solution.Can anybody give me some advice on the
following options?1.NFS over Internet for file sharing2.sshfs3.inotify(our
system's kernel does not support this and we donot want to risk upgrading our
kernel as well)4.drbd in active-active mode5 or any other solutionsAny

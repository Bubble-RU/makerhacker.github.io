</p><p>4 As a consequence,Internet of Thingsresearch is exploring ways to connect smart things together and build upon these networks. [sent-12, score-0.645]
</p><p>5 However, while getting increasingly more connected, embedded devices still form multiple, small, incompatible islands at the application layer: developing applications using them is a challenging task that requires expert knowledge of each platform. [sent-14, score-0.615]
</p><p>6 As a consequence, smart things remain hard to integrate into composite applications. [sent-15, score-0.824]
</p><p>7 In this thesis we use the Web and its emerging technologies as the basis of a smart things application integration platform. [sent-26, score-0.832]
</p><p>8 In particular, we propose a Web of Things application architecture off ering four layers that simplify the development of applications involving smart things. [sent-27, score-0.964]
</p><p>9 First, we address device accessibility and propose implementing, on smart things, the architectural principles that are at the heart of the Web such the Representational State Transfer (REST). [sent-28, score-0.647]
</p><p>10 In the second layer we study findability: In a Web populated by billions of smart things, how can we identify the devices we can interact with, the devices that provide the right service for our application? [sent-30, score-0.921]
</p><p>11 To address these issues we propose a lightweight metadata format that search engines can understand, together with a Web-oriented discovery and lookup infrastructure that leverages the particular context of smart things. [sent-31, score-0.856]
</p><p>12 While the Web of Things fosters a rather open network of physical objects, it is very unlikely that in the future access to smart things will be open to anyone. [sent-32, score-0.761]
</p><p>13 In the third layer we propose a sharing infrastructure that leverages social graphs encapsulated by social networks. [sent-33, score-0.611]
</p><p>14 We demonstrate how this helps sharing smart things in a straightforward, user-friendly and personal manner, building a Social Web of Things. [sent-34, score-0.645]

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.We tend to think compute
of resources as residing primarily in datacenters. Given the fast pace of
innovation we will likely see compute resources become pervasive. Some will
reside in datacenters, but compute resources can be anywhere, not just in the
datacenter, we'll actually see the bulk of compute resources live outside of
datacenters in the future.Given the diversity of compute resources it's
reasonable to assume they won't be homogeneous or conform to a standard API.
They will specialize by service. Programmers will have to use those
specialized service interfaces to build applications that are adaptive enough
to take advantage of whatever leverage they can find, whenever and wherever
they can find it. Once found the application will have to reorganize on the
fly to use whatever new resources it has found and let go of whatever
resources it doesn't have</p><p>3 0.18012084 <a title="1435-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-16-Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_in_the_Ambient_Cloud.html">750 high scalability-2009-12-16-Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear? For years startups, like the frenetically inventive age of the 17th</p><p>6 0.12186402 <a title="1435-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-01-What_Will_Kill_the_Cloud%3F.html">768 high scalability-2010-02-01-What Will Kill the Cloud?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It started out innocently enough with a simple question, "What exactly *is*
the model for PaaS services scalability? If based on HTTP/REST API
integration, fairly easy. If native middleware… input?" You'll forgive the odd
phrasing - Twitter's limitations sometimes make conversations of this nature …
interesting.The discussion culminated in what appeared to be the sentiment
that middleware was mostly obsolete with respect to PaaS.THE OLD WAYVery
briefly for those of you who are more infrastructure / network minded than
application architecture fluent, let's review the traditional middleware-based
application architecture.Generally speaking, middleware - a.k.a. JMS, MQ
Series and most recently, ESB - is leveraged as means to enable a publish-
subscribe model of sharing data. Basically, it's an integration pattern, but
no one really likes to admit that because of the connotations associated with
the evil word "integration" in the enterprise. But that's what it's used for -

though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires

Review, Nicholas Carr writes and speaks on technology, business, and culture.
His provocative 2004 book Does IT Matter? set off a worldwide debate about the
role of computers in business.The Big Switch – Rewiring the World, From Edison
to GoogleCarr's core insight is that the development of the computer and the
Internet remarkably parallels that of the last radically disruptive
technology, electricity. He traces the rapid morphing of electrification from
an in-house competitive advantage to a ubiquitous utility, and how the
business advantage rapidly shifted from the innovators and early adopters to

<p>Introduction: How do you layer a programmable Internet of smart things on top of the web?
That's the question addressed by Dominique Guinard in his ambitious
dissertation: A Web of Things Application Architecture - Integrating the Real-
World (slides). With the continued siloing of content, perhaps we can keep our
things open and talking to each other?In the architecture things are modeled
using REST, they will be findable via search, they will be social via a social
access controller, and they will be mashupable. Here's great graphical
overview of the entire system: Abstract:A central concern in the area of
pervasive computing has been the integration of digital artifactsts with the
physical world and vice-versa. Recent developments in the fi eld of embedded
devices have led to smart things increasingly populating our daily life. We de

<p>Introduction: It's hardly news to anyone that product development and testing involve a lot
of boring routine work, which can lead to human error. To avoid complications
stemming from this, we use AIDA.AIDA(Automated Interactive Deploy Assistant)
is a utility that automatically performs many of the processes in Git,
TeamCity and JIRA.In this post, we focus on how through using AIDA we were
able to automate multiple workflows and create a scheme of continuous
integration.We'll start by looking at the version control system (VCS) we use
here at Badoo, specifically how Git is used to automate creation of release
branches, and their subsequent merging. Then we'll discuss AIDA's major
contribution to both JIRA integration and TeamCity.Git flowThe Badoo Team uses
Git as a version control system. Our model ensures each task is developed and
tested in a separate branch. The branch name consists of the ticket number in
JIRA and a description of the problem.BFG-

<p>Introduction: Update:HostedFTP.com - Amazon S3 Performance Report. How fast is S3? Based on
their own study HostedFTP.com has found: 10 to 12 MB/second when storing and
receiving files and 140 ms per file stored as a fixed overhead
cost.breakUpdate:A Quantitative Comparison of Rackspace and Amazon Cloud
Storage Solutions. S3 isn't the only cloud storage service out there. Mosso is
saying they can save you so money while offering support. There are number of
scenarios in their paper, but For 5TB of cloud storage Mosso will save you 17%
over S3 without support and 42% with support. For their CDN on a Global test
Mosso says the average response time is 333ms for CloudFront vs. 107ms for
Cloud Files which means globally, Cloud Files is 3.1 times or 211% faster than
CloudFront.Amazon S3is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-
scale computing easier for developers.This service allows you to link directly
to files at a cost of 15 cents per GB of storage, and 20 cents per GB
transfer.</p><p>6 0.92746353 <a title="1435-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-21-Hot_Holiday_Scalability_Links_for_2009.html">753 high scalability-2009-12-21-Hot Holiday Scalability Links for 2009</a></p>

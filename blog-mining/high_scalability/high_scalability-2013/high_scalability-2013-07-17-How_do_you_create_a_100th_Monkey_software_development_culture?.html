</p><p>6 They say when bears are thriving in an area it means the ecosystem in that area is pretty healthy because bears are at the top of the food chain. [sent-42, score-0.537]
</p><p>7 But automated documentation generation is not so much about the technology needed to make it happen, it's more about the culture needed to maintain it and make it useful. [sent-46, score-0.727]
</p><p>8 Automated documentation assumes people wrote the documentation to begin with. [sent-48, score-0.781]
</p><p>9 It indicates that someone thought about what they were doing enough that they could explain it coherently to someone else. [sent-51, score-0.6]
</p><p>10 It means that when someone wants to know if a capability is available then they can do a search of the documentation and hopefully find what they are looking for. [sent-52, score-0.458]
</p><p>11 You can make a similar case about many other development practices: unit tests, source code control, bug tracking, training, having a methodology, automated builds, automated regression tests, continuous deployment, monitoring, auto-provisioning, etc etc. [sent-56, score-0.58]
</p><p>12 But if these practices are in place it indicates a pretty healthy development ecosystem in which people are probably pretty productive. [sent-58, score-0.636]
</p><p>13 Another tool that doesn't get enough use is a company or development wide wiki (or equivalent). [sent-59, score-0.455]

<p>Introduction: Aditya Agarwal, Director of Engineering at Facebook, gave an excellent Scale
at Facebooktalk that covers their architecture, but the talk is really more
about how to scale an organization by preserving the best parts of its
culture. The key take home of the talk is: You can get the code right, you can
get the products right, but you need to get the culture right first. If you
don't get the culture right then your company won't scale.This leads into the
four meta secrets of scaling at Facebook:Scaling takes IterationDon't Over
DesignChoose the right tool for the job, but realize that your choice comes
with overhead.Get the culture right. Move Fast \- break things. Huge Impact \-
small teams. Be bold \- innovate.Some Background Facebook is big: 400 million
active users; users spend an average of 20 minutes a day; 5 billion pieces of
content (status updates, comments, likes, photo uploads, video uploads, chat

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: Gordon Ramsayis a world renowned chef with a surprising amount to say on
software development. Well, he says it about cooking and running a restaurant,
but it applies to software development too.You may have seen Gordon Ramsay on
one of his many TV shows. Hell's Kitchen is a competition between chefs trying
to win a dream job: head chef of their own high-end restaurant. On this show
Ramsay is judge, jury, and executioner. And he chops off more than a few
heads. Kitchen Nightmares is a show where Ramsay is called in by restaurant
owners to help turn around their failing restaurants. On this show Ramsay is
there to help.If you just watch Hell's Kitchen you will likely conclude Ramsay
is one of the devil's own helpers ("ram" is the symbol of the devil and "say"
means he speaks for the devil: Ramsay). Ramsay screams, yells, cusses,
belittles, and throws tantrums even a 7 year old could learn from. Then he
does it all over gain just for spite. In Hell's Kitchen there's no evidence at

<p>Introduction: If you've wondered why I haven't been posting lately it's because I've been on
an amazingBeach's motorcycle tourof theAlps(and,and,and,and,and,and,and,and).
My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.The trip was
more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after
mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent
Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling
local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the
winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system,
listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank
water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local
German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of
fellow riders. Magical.They say you'll ride more twists and turns on this trip

<p>Introduction: Over the years I've read a lot of research papers looking for better ways of
doing things. Sometimes I find ideas I can use, but more often than not I come
up empty. The problem is there are very few good papers. And by good I mean:
can a reasonably intelligent person read a paper and turn it into something
useful? Now, clearly I'm not an academic and clearly I'm no genius, I'm just
an everyday programmer searching for leverage, and as a common specimen of the
species I've often thought how much better our industry would be if we could
simply move research from academia into production with some sort of self-
conscious professionalism. Currently the process is horribly hit or miss. And
this problem extends equally to companies with research divisions that often
do very little to help front-line developers succeed. How many ideas break out

<p>Introduction: At the heart of every software adventure exists a journey in service of a
quest. Melodramatic much? Sorry, but while wandering dazzled throughRace to
the End of the Earth, a fantastic exhibit at theRoyal BC Museumon the
1911-1912race to the South Polebetween Norwegian explorerRoald Amundsenand
British naval officerRobert Scott, I couldn't help but think of the two
radically different approaches each team took to the race and it shocked me to
see that some of the same principles that lead to success or failure in
software development also seem to lead to success or failure in exploration.I
wish I could reproduce the experience ofwalking through the exhibit. Plaque
after plaque I remember wondering out loud at Scott's choices and then nod in
agreement with Amundsen's approach. The core conflict was straight out of any
ancient Agile (Amundsen) vs Waterfall (Scott) thread you can find on Usenet.
And Waterfall lost.As background here are some sources you may want to read to

<p>Introduction: In Algorithm Design for Performance Aware VM Consolidation we learn some
shocking facts (gambling in Casablanca?):Average server utilization in many
data centers is low, estimated between 5% and 15%. This is wasteful because an
idle server often consumes more than 50% of peak power.Surely that's just for
old style datacenters? Nope. In Google data centers, workloads that are
consolidated use only 50% of the processor cores. Every other processor core
is left unused simply to ensure that performance does not degrade.It's a VM
wasteland. The goal is to reduce waste by packing VMs onto machines without
hurting performance or wasting resources. The idea is to select VMs that
interfere the least with each other and places them together on the same
server.It's a NP-Complete problem, but this paper describes a practical method
that performs provably close to the optimal. Interestingly they can optimize
for performance or power efficiency, so you can use different algorithms for
different work</p><p>2 0.982346 <a title="1492-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-17-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_July_17%2C_2010.html">860 high scalability-2010-07-17-Hot Scalability Links for July 17, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: While working with Memcache the other night, it dawned on me that it’s usage
as a distributed caching mechanism was really just one of many ways to use it.
That there are in fact many alternative usages that one could find for
Memcache if they could just realize what Memcache really is at its core – a
simple distributed hash-table – is an important point worthy of further
discussion.To be clear, when I say “simple”, by no means am I implying that
Memcache’s implementation is simple, just that the ideas behind it are such.
Think about that for a minute. What else could we use a simple distributed
hash-table for, besides caching? How about using it as an alternative to the
traditional shard lookup method we used in our Master Index Lookup scalability
strategy, discussed previously here.</p><p>4 0.96769267 <a title="1492-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-15-The_Amazing_Collective_Compute_Power_of_the_Ambient_Cloud.html">778 high scalability-2010-02-15-The Amazing Collective Compute Power of the Ambient Cloud</a></p>

Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.Earlier we talked about
how a single botnet could harness more compute power than our largest super

available to the Ambient Cloud will be truly astounding.2 Billion Personal
ComputersThe number of personal computers is still growing. By 2014 one
estimate is there will be2 billion PCs. That's a giant reservoir of power to
exploit, especially considering these new boxes are stuffed with multiple
powerful processors and gigabytes of memory.7 Billion SmartphonesBy now it's
common wisdom smartphones are the computing platform of the future. It's
plausible to assume the total number ofmobile phonesin use will roughly equal
the number of people on earth. That's 7 billion smartphones.Smartphones aren't

<p>Introduction: Om proposes one solution to theTwitter Problemis tolimit followersto three
square meals a day. The reasonable idea being that lower limits should mean
fewer scaling problems. And as a kicker raising those limits is a good way to
raise much needed revenue.Scoble thinks users shouldconsume without limitand
will drive to another buffet if all-you-can-eat privileges are revoked. The
reasonable idea being that if an internet service can't solve internet scale
problems then there's not much use for it.Dave sayscomp power users a top
floor suiteand shower them with free passes to the buffet. Let the good times
roll! The reasonable idea being that power users help create popular
restaurants, er, services in the first place and limiting them starves users
and starved users won't come back.So, should web services like Twitter be a
buffet, a fixed eight course fine dining experience, a small plate restaurant,
a family style joint, or a vending machine? Or something else entirely?In a

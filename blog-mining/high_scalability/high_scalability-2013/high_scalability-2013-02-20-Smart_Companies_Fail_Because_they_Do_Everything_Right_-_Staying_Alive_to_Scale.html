[sent-13, score-0.22]
</p><p>2 Disruptors create disruptive innovations at the low-margin end of the market. [sent-15, score-0.334]
</p><p>3 Appearing weak, disruptors aren't initially a threat to sustainers, but disruptive products become better and better over time, overtaking the sustainers and killing them off. [sent-16, score-0.674]
</p><p>4 They cater to high-profit-margin customers and ignore the low end of the market, where disruptive innovations emerge from. [sent-23, score-0.334]
</p><p>5 Intel's Andy Grove took the disruption model to heart and decided to cannibalize their own market by developing the Celeron Processor, a cheap and low-performance chip, disrupting Cyrix and AMD, and becoming the highest-volume product in the company. [sent-25, score-0.178]
</p><p>6 Tax investment capital at lower rates the longer it has been invested . [sent-32, score-0.618]
</p><p>7 Part of the cause he thinks is the  Doctrine of New Finance : "We’ve encouraged managers to measure profitability based on a return on net assets, or return on capital employed. [sent-34, score-0.252]
</p><p>8 That encourages companies to liberate their capital, so they invest in efficiency innovations, which means they can make more money with fewer resources. [sent-35, score-0.256]
</p><p>9 " For more jobs we need to encourage greater innovation which means we need to encourage longer term investments. [sent-36, score-0.581]
</p><p>10 Only investments held more than a year get a lower tax rate and year is very short term. [sent-37, score-0.626]
</p><p>11 His suggestion is not for the government to pick winners, but to change the tax code to encourage longer term investment by lowering the tax rate as the period of investment increases, perhaps even going negative. [sent-38, score-1.307]
</p><p>12 I did little investigation on the tax rate issue, you'll find a couple of related papers at the end of this article. [sent-39, score-0.444]
</p><p>13 You may remember that we in the US did have a graduated system of capital gains taxes at one time, where short, intermediate, and long term (5 years) gains were taxed at different rates. [sent-40, score-1.019]
</p><p>14 The idea was to encourage longer term investments with lower tax rates, making riskier long term investments more attractive. [sent-41, score-1.272]
</p><p>15 That system was removed in 1997 to favor short term thinking. [sent-42, score-0.15]
</p><p>16 I'm assuming the "going negative" part of his plan means a tax credit. [sent-43, score-0.311]
</p><p>17 Another suggestion I haven't heard, made by someone I talked to, is to  make jobs the measure:      Like long-term capital gains, qualified dividends are taxed at a lower rate. [sent-47, score-1.079]
</p><p>18 Currently, dividends paid by most all US companies, and even some foreign ones meet the criteria for qualified dividends. [sent-48, score-0.412]
</p><p>19 If we really want to make job creation a priority, why not tie the qualified dividends to US jobs? [sent-49, score-0.412]
</p><p>20 Qualified dividends could be allocated based on a company's US workforce compared to its workforce outside the US. [sent-50, score-0.444]

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by    Nick Burling , VP of Product Management of  Bluestripe . 
   Readers of High Scalability know are well versed in performance optimization techniques. Reverse proxies, Varnish, Redis — you hear about them daily. But what you may not realize is that one of the oldest technologies in your stack can be one of your biggest bottlenecks: DNS. 
   People don't spend a lot of time thinking about DNS. It's not sexy. It's an infrastructure service, and it's just supposed to work. 
  At BlueStripe, we work with many teams running applications that support millions of web requests a day. We keep seeing DNS delays and errors that the platform operations team never knows about. It's so common we've start calling it the  Hidden DNS Tax .
   What is the Hidden DNS Tax?     The Hidden DNS Tax is a hard-to-see performance hit your users take from DNS timeouts and errors in your back-end architecture. We've seen it bring down the main web application for a Fortune 10 company.</p><p>3 0.11766202 <a title="1410-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-28-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_December_28%2C_2012.html">1378 high scalability-2012-12-28-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For December 28, 2012</a></p>

 Quotable Quotes:                        
 
  @hackofalltrades : When positive change is only viewed through its scalability, bad things happen. 
  @faizanj : Is it time for #Netflix to move to a hybrid cloud architecture similar to Zynga zCloud? 
  @adrianco : we try not to invest in undifferentiated heavy lifting 
  @qui_oui : "scalability": a word that makes me think of how likely you are to have the ability to grow scales. 
  @Ninad_M : The question is, is #antifragile conceptually opposite of #bigdata 
  @pbailis : Batch your disk/network IO, kernel interrupts, customer package shipments -> delay arrival but increase efficiency 
  @Carnage4Life : One lesson that is hard for people to learn. Knowing that something occurred is different from knowing why it occurred

<p>Introduction: This topic has been ripped directly from Lambda the Ultimate's  What will programming look like in 2020?  post. They are having a lively discussion and if you are interested in flexing your holiday thought muscles we might have a good discussion too.
 
Eight years is a difficult prediction horizon. It's too short to simply project out current trends and it's too long to discount potential technological breakthroughs coming to market. There's the challenge.
 
Some of my lousy predictions: 
  
  Programmers Will Form Guilds Around New Gamified Training Hubs  
  The Web Will Become More Closed Before it Becomes More Open  
  Not Everyone Will Become a Programmer  
  Focus Will Shift to Creating Bigger People Instead of Chasing Big Ideas

<p>Introduction: Gordon Ramsay  is a world renowned chef with a surprising amount to say on software development. Well, he says it about cooking and running a restaurant, but it applies to software development too.
 
You may have seen Gordon Ramsay on one of his many TV shows. Hell's Kitchen is a competition between chefs trying to win a dream job: head chef of their own high-end restaurant. On this show Ramsay is judge, jury, and executioner. And he chops off more than a few heads. Kitchen Nightmares is a show where Ramsay is called in by restaurant owners to help turn around their failing restaurants. On this show Ramsay is there to help.
 
If you just watch Hell's Kitchen you will likely conclude Ramsay is one of the devil's own helpers ("ram" is the symbol of the devil and "say" means he speaks for the devil: Ramsay). Ramsay screams, yells, cusses, belittles, and throws tantrums even a 7 year old could learn from. Then he does it all over gain just for spite. In Hell's Kitchen there's no evidence a</p><p>5 0.77450335 <a title="1410-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-09-Applications_as_Virtual_States.html">790 high scalability-2010-03-09-Applications as Virtual States</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my article  Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.   
 
As I was writing  an article  on the architecture of the  Storm Botnet , I couldn't help but notice the deep similarity of how Storm works and changes we're seeing in the evolution of political systems. In particular, the rise of the  virtual-state . As crazy as this may sound, I think this is also the direction applications will need follow to survive in a complex world of billions of compute devices.
 
You may have already heard of  virtual corporations .  Virtual corporations are companies with limited office space, a distributed workforce, and production facilities located wherever it is profitable to locate them. The idea is to stay lean and compete using the  rapid development and introduction of new products into high value-added markets . If you spot a market opportunity with a small time window, building your own factories and hiring and engine</p><p>6 0.77424955 <a title="1410-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-20-Packet_Pushers%3A_How_to_Build_a_Low_Cost_Data_Center.html">1027 high scalability-2011-04-20-Packet Pushers: How to Build a Low Cost Data Center</a></p>

<p>Introduction: GridwiseTech has  developed AdHoc , an advanced framework for sharing geographically distributed data and compute resources. It simplifies the resource management and makes cooperation secure and effective. The premise of AdHoc is to enable each member of the associated institution to control access to his or her resources without an IT administrator’s help, and with high security level of any exposed data or applications assured. It takes 3 easy steps to establish cooperation within AdHoc: create a virtual organization, add resources and share them. The application can be implemented within any organization to exchange data and resources or between institutions to join forces for more efficient results.  AdHoc was initially created for a consortium of hospitals and institutions to share medical data sets. As a technical partner in that project, GridwiseTech implemented the Security Framework to provide access to that data and designed a graphical tool to facilitate the administration</p><p>4 0.87073374 <a title="1410-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-23-Postgresql_on_high_availability_websites%3F.html">73 high scalability-2007-08-23-Postgresql on high availability websites?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Wired has a  wonderful interview  with  Clayton Christensen , author of the tech ninja's bible,  Innovator's Dilemma . Innovation is the name of the game in Silicon Valley and if you want to understand the rules of the game this article is a quick and clear way of learning. Everything is simply explained with compelling examples by the man himself.
 
Just as every empire has fallen, every organization is open to disruption. It's the human condition to become comfortable and discount potential dangers. It takes a great deal of mindfulness to outwit and outlast the human condition. If you want to be the disruptor and avoid being the disruptee, this is good stuff.
 
He also talks about his new book,  The Capitalist's Dilemma , which addresses this puzzle: if corporations are doing so well why are individuals doing so bad?
 
If someone can help you see a deep meaningful pattern in life then they haven't brought you a fish, they've taught you how to fish. That's what Christensen does. Here'</p><p>6 0.82594126 <a title="1410-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-06-10_Ways_to_Take_your_Site_from_One_to_One_Million_Users_by_Kevin_Rose__.html">715 high scalability-2009-10-06-10 Ways to Take your Site from One to One Million Users by Kevin Rose  </a></p>

</p><p>2 If you don't need low latency messaging, highly recommend celery + SQS. [sent-18, score-0.11]
</p><p>3 Cell-Based Computing Goes Analog: designing circuits in Escherichia coli that could perform functions based on a range of inputs, much like the temperature gauge on a thermostat. [sent-23, score-0.145]
</p><p>4 Specifically, the circuits were sensitive to levels of sugar arabinose or acyl homoserine lactone. [sent-24, score-0.086]
</p><p>5 Horst Simon on Why we need Exascale and why we won't get there by 2020: You could say that the end of the HPC world as we know it began in 2004, when we hit the inflection point of power use and clock speed. [sent-29, score-0.069]
</p><p>6 In "new" HPC, power is the primary design constraint for future HPC system design; data movement dominates costs, so we need to optimize to minimize data movement; to increase concurrency we look to exponential growth of parallelism within chips. [sent-31, score-0.125]
</p><p>7 Google, once the cheerleader of the open web, is rapidly turning its back on every single open standard they once championed. [sent-41, score-0.126]

</p><p>10 It kind of goes against something people often say which is 'don't reinvent the wheel', but sometimes if you are having problems with your wheel you have to step back and think about how do I fix the problem, and sometimes reinventing the wheel is the right thing to do. [sent-58, score-0.246]

</p><p>12 Any backdoor is a breach for anyone to go once more into. [sent-83, score-0.188]
</p><p>13 " An Inside Look at Type Ahead Search in Evernote: When a user begins typing in the search box, the Suggestion Retrieval system first determines the set of notes that fall within the user's context, the combination of notebook and tags inside which the user is currently searching. [sent-86, score-0.251]
</p><p>14 It then looks up the search query prefix in the suggestion index, which yields a set of completions for that prefix. [sent-87, score-0.43]
</p><p>15 Finally, it filters out any completions that do not fall within the contextual notes. [sent-88, score-0.252]
</p><p>16 Next, every suggestion is scored and ranked for relevance by a custom formula. [sent-89, score-0.127]
</p><p>17 Pinocchio: Nearly Practical Verifiable Computation: Pinocchio's verification time is typically 10ms: 5-7 orders of magnitude less than previous work; indeed Pinocchio is the first general-purpose system to demonstrate verification cheaper than native execution (for some apps). [sent-99, score-0.241]
</p><p>18 Direct GPU/FPGA Communication Via PCI Express: We describe a mechanism for connecting GPU and FPGA devices directly via the PCI Express bus, enabling the transfer of data between these heterogeneous computing units without the intermediate use of system memory. [sent-100, score-0.092]
</p><p>19 We evaluate the performance benefits of this approach over a range of transfer sizes, and demonstrate its utility in a computer vision application. [sent-101, score-0.159]

info from Steve Souder,Greg Linden, andMarissa Mayer. Speed [is] an
undervalued and under-discussed asset on the web.Update 7:How do you know when
you need more memcache servers?. Dathan Pattishall talks about using memcache
not to scale, but to reduce latency and reduce I/O spikes, and how to use
stats to know when more servers are needed.Update 6:Stock Traders Find Speed
Pays, in Milliseconds. Goldman Sachs is making record profits off a500
millisecondtrading advantage. Yes, latency matters. As an interesting aside,
Libet found 500 msecs is about the time it takes the brain to weave together
an experience of consciousness from all our sensor inputs.Update 5:Shopzilla's

negative effects do you see with this. It's programmed in Java, but could just
as easily be programmed in any other typical language. It's thread safe and
does not use any synchronization. When testing it on my laptop, I was able to
generate 10 million IDs within about 15 seconds, so it should be more than
fast enough.Take a look at the attachment.. (had to rename it from IdGen.java

you to a rocket and zooms you up to 50,000 feet so you can take a look at best
web operations practices from a broad, yet practical perspective. The author
and his team of contributors obviously have a lot of in the trenches

from.The paper has too many details to cover here, but the big sections

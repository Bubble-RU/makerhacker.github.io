<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.

  1,966,080 cores : Time Warp synchronization protocol using up to 7.8M MPI tasks on 1,966,080 cores of the {Sequoia} Blue Gene/Q supercomputer system. 33 trillion events processed in 65 seconds yielding a peak event-rate in excess of 504 billion events/second using 120 racks of Sequoia.

  Thad Starner : the longer accessing a device exceeds 2s, the more its actually usage would decrease exponentially. Thus, he made a claim that wrist watch interface always sitting on one's wrist ready to use should be more successful than mobile phones which have to pulled out of the pocket.

 Quotable quotes:            
 
  Markus Frind :   Scaling is not very fun these days.  
  Mike Krieger : Scaling is like replacing all components on a car while driving it at 100 mph.  
  @jaykreps : We built servers that could handle 100k connections by building servers that could handle 10k connections and waiting a decade. 
  @RichExperiences : Twitter alone generates more than 7 terabytes of data every day, Facebook 10 TB...

  Tesla : When wireless is perfectly applied the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain, which in fact it is, all things being particles of a real and rhythmic whole. We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance. Not only this, but through television and telephony we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of miles; and the instruments through which we shall be able to do this will be amazingly simple compared with our present telephone. A man will be able to carry one in his vest pocket.

<p>Introduction: Over the last several decades computer architects have been phenomenally successful turning the transistor bounty provided by Moore's Law into chips with ever increasing single-threaded performance. During many of these successful years, however, many researchers paid scant attention to multiprocessor work. Now as vendors turn to multicore chips, researchers are reacting with more papers on multi-threaded systems. While this is good, we are concerned that further work on single-thread performance will be squashed.     To help understand future high-level trade-offs, we develop a corollary to Amdahl's Law for multicore chips [Hill & Marty, IEEE Computer 2008]. It models fixed chip resources for alternative designs that use symmetric cores, asymmetric cores, or dynamic techniques that allow cores to work together on sequential execution. Our results encourage multicore designers to view performance of the entire chip rather than focus on core efficiencies. Moreover, we observe that obtai</p><p>2 0.94609177 <a title="1487-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-09-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_September_9%2C_2011.html">1113 high scalability-2011-09-09-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For September 9, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hey, this scaling stuff might just be important.  Jim Scheinman,  former Bebo and Friendster exec, puts the blame squarely on Friendster's inability to scale as why they lost the social networking race:   VB  : Can you tell me a bit about what you learned in your time at Friendster? 
 
     JS  :  For me, it basically came down to failed execution on the technology side — we had millions of Friendster members begging us to get the site working faster so they could log in and spend hours social networking with their friends. I remember coming in to the office for months reading thousands of customer service emails telling us that if we didn’t get our site working better soon, they’d be ‘forced to join’ a new social networking site that had just launched called MySpace…the rest is history. To be fair to Friendster’s technology team at the time, they were on the forefront of many new scaling and database issues that web sites simply hadn’t had to deal with prior to Friendster.

<p>Introduction: If you just can't get enough high scalability talk you might want to take a look GigaOm's Structure 08 conference. The slate of speakers looks appropriately interesting and San Francisco is truly magical this time of year. High Scalability readers even get a price break is you use the HIGHSCALE discount code! I'll be on vacation so I won't see you there, but it looks like a good time. For a nice change of pace consider visiting   MoMA   next door.  Here's a blurb on the conference:   A reminder to our readers about Structure 08, GigaOm's upcoming conference dedicated to web infrastructure. In addition to keynotes from leaders like Jim Crowe, chairman and CEO of Level 3 Communications and Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon, the event will feature workshops from Google App Engine, Microsoft and a special workshop from Fenwick and West who will cover how to raise money for an infrastructure start up.

<p>Introduction: Neil Conway  from Berkeley CS is giving an advanced level talk at  a meetup today  in San Francisco on a new paper:  Logic and Lattices for Distributed Programming  - extending set logic to support CRDT-style lattices. 
 
The description of the meetup is probably the clearest introduction to the paper:
  Developers are increasingly choosing datastores that sacrifice strong consistency guarantees in exchange for improved performance and availability. Unfortunately, writing reliable distributed programs without the benefit of strong consistency can be very challenging.

 


In this talk, I'll discuss work from our group at UC Berkeley that aims to make it easier to write distributed programs without relying on strong consistency. Bloom is a declarative programming language for distributed computing, while CALM is an analysis technique that identifies programs that are guaranteed to be eventually consistent. I'll then discuss our recent work on extending CALM to support a broader range of</p><p>same-blog 6 0.91204733 <a title="1487-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-05-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_5%2C_2013.html">1487 high scalability-2013-07-05-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 5, 2013</a></p>

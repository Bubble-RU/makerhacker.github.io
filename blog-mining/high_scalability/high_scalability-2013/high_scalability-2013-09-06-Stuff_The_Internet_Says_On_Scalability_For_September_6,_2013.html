<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear?

     Amazing microscope image of a carnivorous bladderwort    
  How many drones would it take to replace Santa?  With a fleet of some 80 million or so F-16 drones the entire worldwide delivery could be completed in just over eight hours. Impressive, but a world without Rudolf is not a world I wish to contemplate.

  Thad Starner : the longer accessing a device exceeds 2s, the more its actually usage would decrease exponentially. Thus, he made a claim that wrist watch interface always sitting on one's wrist ready to use should be more successful than mobile phones which have to pulled out of the pocket.  
  @joedevon : We came for scalability but we stayed for agility #NoSQL

<p>Introduction: In   NoSQL: Past, Present, Future    Eric Brewer  has a particularly fine section on explaining the often hard to understand ideas of   BASE   (Basically Available, Soft State, Eventually Consistent),   ACID   (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability),   CAP   (Consistency Availability, Partition Tolerance), in terms of a pernicious long standing myth about the sanctity of consistency in banking.
    Myth   : Money is important, so banks   must   use transactions to keep money safe and consistent, right? 
    Reality   : Banking transactions are inconsistent, particularly for ATMs. ATMs are designed to have a normal case behaviour and a partition mode behaviour. In partition mode Availability is chosen over Consistency. 
   Why?   1)  Availability correlates with revenue and consistency generally does not.  2)  Historically there was never an idea of perfect communication so everything was partitioned.

<p>Introduction: Although the problem of scaling human genome sequencing is not exactly about building bigger, faster and more reliable websites it is most interesting in terms of scalability. The  paper  describes a new technology by the startup company Complete Genomics to sequence the full human genome for the fraction of the cost of earlier possibilities.  Complete Genomics is building the worldâ&euro;&trade;s largest commercial human genome sequencing center to provide turnkey, outsourced complete human genome sequencing to customers worldwide.  By 2010, their data center will contain approximately 60,000 processors with 30 petabytes of storage running their sequencing software on Linux clusters.

<p>Introduction: In the more cool stuff I've never heard of before department is something called   Self Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance   (SCIT).  Botnets  are created when vulnerable computers live long enough to become infected with the will to do the evil bidding of their evil masters. Security is almost always about removing vulnerabilities (a process which to outside observers often looks like a  dog chasing its tail ). SCIT takes a different approach, it works on the availability angle. Something I never thought of before, but which makes a great deal of sense once I thought about it.  With SCIT you stop and restart VM instances every minute (or whatever depending in your desired window vulnerability)....
   
 This short exposure window means worms and viri do not have long enough to fully infect a machine and carry out a coordinated attack. A machine is up for a while. Does work. And then is torn down again only to be reborn as a clean VM with no possibility of infection (unless of course the VM</p><p>same-blog 4 0.88572794 <a title="1513-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-06-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_September_6%2C_2013.html">1513 high scalability-2013-09-06-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For September 6, 2013</a></p>

  @rob_carlson : Packet switching via containers --> almost 8X increase in trade; what will #drones bring? What is optimal mesh size? 
  @mrtazz : “an Open Source, Clojure-based DevOps platform” congratulations, I now have no idea what you’re talking about

<p>Introduction: A lot of apps need to map IP addresses to locations.  Jeremy Cole in   On efficiently geo-referencing IPs with MaxMind GeoIP and MySQL GIS   succinctly explains the many uses for such a feature:     Geo-referencing IPs is, in a nutshell, converting an IP address, perhaps from an incoming web visitor, a log file, a data file, or some other place, into the name of some entity owning that IP address. There are a lot of reasons you may want to geo-reference IP addresses to country, city, etc., such as in simple ad targeting systems, geographic load balancing, web analytics, and many more applications.       This is difficult to do efficiently, at least it gives me a bit of brain freeze. In the same post Jeremy nicely explains where to get the geo-rereferncing data, how to load data,  and the performance of different approaches for IP address searching. It's a great practical introduction to the subject.</p><p>6 0.86582714 <a title="1513-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-04-Product%3A_Cacti.html">58 high scalability-2007-08-04-Product: Cacti</a></p>

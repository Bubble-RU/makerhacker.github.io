<p>Introduction: Update 4: Heroku versus GAE & GAE/JUpdate 3:Heroku has gone live!.
Congratulations to the team. It's difficult right now to get a feeling for the
relative cost and reliability of Heroku, but it's an impressive accomplishment
and a viable option for people looking for a delivery platform.Update 2:Heroku
Architecture. A great interactive presentation of the Heroku stack. Requests
flow into Nginx used as a HTTP Reverse Proxy. Nginx routes requests into a
Varnish based HTTP cache. Then requests are injected into an Erlang based
routing mesh that balances requests across a grid of dynos. Dynos are your
application "VMs" that implement application specific behaviors. Dynos
themselves are a stack of: POSIX, Ruby VM, App Server, Rack, Middleware,
Framework, Your App. Applications can access PostgreSQL. Memcached is used as
an application caching layer.Update: Aaron WorshamInterview with James

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byShawn Hsiao,Luke Massa, andVictor Luu. Shawn
runsTripAdvisor's Technical Operations team, Luke and Victor interned on his
team this past summer. This post is introduced byAndy Gelfond, TripAdvisor's
head of engineering.It's been a little over a year since our last post about
theTripAdvisor architecture. It has been an exciting year. Our business and
team continues to grow, we are now an independent public company, and we have
continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown -
we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work
across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:56M visitors per
month350M+ pages requests a day120TB+ of warehouse data running on a large
Hadoop cluster, and quickly growingWe also had a very successful college
intern program that brought on over 60 interns this past summer, all who were

<p>Introduction: In Resolved: Widespread Application Outage, Herokutells their story of how
they dealt with theAmazon outage. While taking 100% responsibility for the
downtime, they also shared a number of the strategies they used to bring their
service back to full working order.One ofHeroku'smost interesting strategies
wasn't a technical hack at all, but how they consciously went about deploying
their Ops personnel in response to the emergency. An outline of their strategy
is: Monitoring systems immediately alerted Ops to the problem. An on-call
engineer applied triage logic to the problem and classified it as serious,
which caused the on-callIncident Commanderto be woken out of restful slumber.

<p>Introduction: This is a part interview part guest with Sebastian Stadil, founder ofScalr, a
cheaper open-source version of RightScale. Scalr takes care of all the web
site infrastructure bits to on Amazon (and other clouds) so you don't have
to.I first met Sebastian at one of the original Silicon Valley Cloud Computing
Group meetups, a group which he founded. The meetings started in the tiny
offices of Intalio where Sebastian was working with this new fangled Amazon
thing to create an auto-scaling server farm on EC2. I remember distinctly how
Sebastian met everyone at the door with a handshake and a smile, making us all
feel welcome. Later I took one of the classes he created on how to use AWS. I
guess he figured all this cloud stuff was going somewhere and decided to start
Scalr.My only regret about this post is that the name Amazon does not begin
with the letter 'S', that would have made for an epic title.Getting to Know

atBazaarvoice.Bazaarvoice is a company that people interact with on a regular
basis but have probably never heard of. If you read customer reviews on sites
like bestbuy.com, nike.com, or walmart.com, you are using Bazaarvoice
services. These sites, along with thousands of others, rely on Bazaarvoice to
supply the software and technology to collect and display user conversations
about products and services. All of this means that Bazaarvoice processes a
lot of sentiment data on most of the products we all use daily.Bazaarvoice
helps our clients make better products by using a combination of machine
learning and natural language processing to extract useful information and
user sentiments from the millions of free-text reviews that go through our
platform. This data gets boiled down into reports that clients can use to
improve their products and services. We are also starting to look at how to

<p>Introduction: In a recent thread on Hacker News discussing recent AWS price changes,seldo
mentioned they use AWS for business, they just never use EBS on AWS. A good
question was asked:How do you even do anything without using EBS?Amazon
certainly makes using EBS the easiest path. And EBS has a better reliability
record as of late, but it's still often recommended to not use EBS. This
avoids a single point of failure at the cost of a lot of complexity, though as
AWS uses EBS internally, not using EBS may not save you if you use other AWS
services like RDS or ELB.If you don't want to use EBS, it's hard to know where
to even start. A dilemma to which Kevin Nuckolls gives a great answer:Well,
you break your services out onto stateless and stateful machines. After that,
you make sure that each of your stateful services is resilient to individual
node failure. I prefer to believe that if you can't roll your entire
infrastructure over to new nodes monthly then you're unprepared for the
eventual outage of</p><p>6 0.7323913 <a title="1470-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-20-Netflix%3A_Harden_Systems_Using_a_Barrel_of_Problem_Causing_Monkeys_-_Latency%2C_Conformity%2C_Doctor%2C_Janitor%2C_Security%2C_Internationalization%2C_Chaos.html">1083 high scalability-2011-07-20-Netflix: Harden Systems Using a Barrel of Problem Causing Monkeys - Latency, Conformity, Doctor, Janitor, Security, Internationalization, Chaos</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hey guys,There is a renewed push at my organization to deploy
vmware...everywhere.I am rather excited as I know we have a lot of waste when
it comes to resources.What has pricked my ears up however, is the notion of
using this technology in our very busy public facing DMZ's.Today we get lots
of spikes of traffic and we are coping very well. 40x HP blades,
apache/php/perl/tomcat/ all in HA behind HA F5's and HA Checkpoint FW's. (20
servers in 2 datacentres).The idea is, we virtualise these machines, including
the firewalls onto hosts vmware clusters that span the public interface to our
internal networks. This is something that has gone against the #1 rule I have
ever lived by while working on the inet. No airgaps from the unknown to the
known!I am interested in feedback on this scenario.From a resource
perspective, our resource requirements in the DMZ will be lowered over time
due to business change and we still have a lot of head room in our capacity.Do
you think this is change for ch</p><p>2 0.96981466 <a title="1470-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-20-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_September_20%2C_2013.html">1520 high scalability-2013-09-20-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For September 20, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you just want to visit Rome and not go full on Cloud Native like Netflix,
thenSoundslice'sAdrian HolovatyinWhy I left Heroku, and notes on my new AWS
setup provides a simple guide for helping make your first trip a good
one.First, let's dispose of why Soundslice left Heroku. The essence is because
of various issues "Heroku lost my trust." YMMV, but once a fact, what do you
do?After a consultation withScott VanDenPlas, former director of dev ops for
the Obama reelection tech team, they came up a simple transition guide that I
think is quite good and generally useful (full details in theoriginal post):
Bake an AMI. Install all the stuff you need on an AMI and use that as your
deployment unit. This works well for Netflix and for users who value a certain
sort of simplicity more than flexibility. There were a lot of comments saying
how it's better to use Chef/Puppet and configure instances on the fly, but
there's a confidence that only a baked image provides.Set up auto-scaling
rules. T</p><p>6 0.96330345 <a title="1470-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-23-GoogleTalk_Architecture.html">21 high scalability-2007-07-23-GoogleTalk Architecture</a></p>

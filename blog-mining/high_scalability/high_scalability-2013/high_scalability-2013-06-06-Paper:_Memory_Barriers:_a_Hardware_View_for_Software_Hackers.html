<p>Introduction: Most every programmer who gets sucked into deep performance analysis for long
running processes eventually realizes memory allocation is the heart of evil
at the center of many of their problems. So you replace malloc with something
less worse. Or you tune your garbage collector like a fine ukulele. But
there's a smarter approach brought to you from the folks atRAMCloud, a
Stanford University production, which is a large scale, distributed, in-memory
key-value database.What they've found is that typical memory management
approaches don't work and using a log structured approach yields massive
benefits:Performance measurements of log-structured memory in RAMCloud show
that it enables high client through- put at 80-90% memory utilization, even
with artificially stressful workloads. In the most stressful workload, a
single RAMCloud server can support 270,000-410,000 durable 100-byte writes per
second at 90% memory utilization. The two-level approach to cleaning improves

<p>Introduction: "It's all a numbers game - the dirty little secret of scalable systems"Martin
Thompsonis a High Performance Computing Specialist with a real mission to
teach programmers how to understand the innards of modern computing systems.
He has many talks and classes (listed below) on caches, buffers, memory
controllers, processor architectures, cache lines, etc.His thought is
programmers do not put a proper value on understanding how the underpinnings
of our systems work. We gravitate to the shiny and trendy. His approach is not
to teach people specific programming strategies, but to teach programmers to
fish so they can feed themselves. Without a real understanding strategies are
easy to apply wrongly.  It's strange how programmers will put a lot of effort
into understanding complicated frameworks like Hibernate, but little effort
into understanding the underlying hardware on which their programs run.A major
tenant of Martin's approach is to "lead by experimental observation rather
than what</p><p>4 0.11671146 <a title="1471-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Are_Cloud_Based_Memory_Architectures_the_Next_Big_Thing%3F.html">538 high scalability-2009-03-16-Are Cloud Based Memory Architectures the Next Big Thing?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-

<p>Introduction: Although I have a basic working knowledge of memory, SSDs and the like, I am
not technical...I have never developed or deployed a system. I was exposed to
ram-disks years ago, when their expense limited their use to very small files
or DB applications. I am looking to "get current" on what role memory plays in
curremt WEB 2.0 design and deployments.How is memory commonly used to remove
latency and accelerate performance in typical Web 2.0 architectures? What role
can memory play in massive scale-out implementations? Are there such a thing
as memory "best practives"? If memory were cheap, would that significantly
change the way systems are designed and deployed?What commercial and open
source products that use memory are used, what are the benefits and trade-
offs?Can anyone suggest what sources - people, books, papers, products - I
might look into to gain a practical understanding of this topic?</p><p>6 0.11264343 <a title="1471-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-21-9_Principles_of_High_Performance_Programs.html">1652 high scalability-2014-05-21-9 Principles of High Performance Programs</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Arvid Norbergon thelibtorrent bloghas put together an excellent list
ofprinciples of high performance programs, obviously derived from hard won
experience programming on bittorrent:Two fundamental causes of performance
problems:Memory Latency. A big performance problem on modern computers is the
latency of SDRAM. The CPU waits idle for a read from memory to come
back.Context Switching. When a CPU switches context "the memory it will access
is most likely unrelated to the memory the previous context was accessing.
This often results in significant eviction of the previous cache, and requires
the switched-to context to load much of its data from RAM, which is
slow."Rules to help balance the forces of evil:Batch work. Avoid context
switching by batching work. For example, there are vector versions of system
calls like writev() and readv() that operate on more than one item per call.
An implication is that you want to merge as many writes as possible.Avoid
Magic Numbers. They don't scale.</p><p>3 0.84271091 <a title="1471-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-20-8_Ways_Stardog_Made_its_Database_Insanely_Scalable.html">1582 high scalability-2014-01-20-8 Ways Stardog Made its Database Insanely Scalable</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stardog makes a commercial graph database that is a great example of what can
be accomplished with a scale-up strategy on BigIron. In a recent article
StarDog described how they made their new 2.1 release insanely scalable,
improving query scalability by about 3 orders of magnitude and it can now
handle 50 billion triples on a $10,000 server with 32 cores and 256 GB RAM. It
can also load 20B datasets at 300,000 triples per second. What did they do
that you can also do?Avoid locks by using non-blocking algorithms and data
structures. For example, moving from BitSet to ConcurrentLinkedQueue.Use
ThreadLocal aggressively to reduce thread contention and avoid
synchronization.Batch LRU evictions in a single thread. Triggered by several
LRU caches becoming problematic when evictions were being swamped by
additions. Downside is batching increases memory pressure and GC times.Move to
SHA1 for hashing URIs, bnodes, and literal values. Making hash collisions
nearly impossible enable significant s</p><p>4 0.81819379 <a title="1471-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-20-Paper%3A_Log-structured_Memory_for_DRAM-based_Storage_-_High_Memory_Utilization_Plus_High_Performance.html">1616 high scalability-2014-03-20-Paper: Log-structured Memory for DRAM-based Storage - High Memory Utilization Plus High Performance</a></p>

<p>Introduction: InZen And The Art Of Scaling - A Koan And Epigram Approach,Russell
Sullivanoffered an interesting conjecture: there are 20 classic bottlenecks.
This sounds suspiciously like the idea that there only20 basic story plots.
And depending on how you chunkify things, it may be true, but in practice we
all know bottlenecks come in infinite flavors, all tasting of sour and ash.One
dayAurelien Broszniowskifrom Terracotta emailed me his list of bottlenecks, we
cc'ed Russell in on the conversation, he gave me his list, I have a list, and
here's the resulting stone soup.Russell said this is his "I wish I knew when I
was younger" list and I think that's an enriching way to look at it. The more
experience you have, the more different types of projects you tackle, the more
lessons you'll be able add to a list like this. So when you read this list,
and when you make your own, you are stepping through years of accumulated
experience and more than a little frustration, but in each there is a story

<p>Introduction: I have introduced pattern languages in my earlier post onThe Pattern Bible for
Distributed Computing.Achieving highest possible scalability is a complex
combination of many factors. This PLoP 2007paperpresents a pattern language
that can be used to make a system highly scalable.The Scalability Pattern

<p>Introduction: In Algorithm Design for Performance Aware VM Consolidation we learn some
shocking facts (gambling in Casablanca?):Average server utilization in many
data centers is low, estimated between 5% and 15%. This is wasteful because an
idle server often consumes more than 50% of peak power.Surely that's just for
old style datacenters? Nope. In Google data centers, workloads that are
consolidated use only 50% of the processor cores. Every other processor core
is left unused simply to ensure that performance does not degrade.It's a VM
wasteland. The goal is to reduce waste by packing VMs onto machines without
hurting performance or wasting resources. The idea is to select VMs that
interfere the least with each other and places them together on the same
server.It's a NP-Complete problem, but this paper describes a practical method
that performs provably close to the optimal. Interestingly they can optimize
for performance or power efficiency, so you can use different algorithms for
different work</p><p>same-blog 3 0.87149531 <a title="1471-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-06-Paper%3A_Memory_Barriers%3A_a_Hardware_View_for_Software_Hackers.html">1471 high scalability-2013-06-06-Paper: Memory Barriers: a Hardware View for Software Hackers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's not often you get so enthusiastic a recommendation for a paper as Sergio
Bossa gives Memory Barriers: a Hardware View for Software Hackers: If you only
want to read one piece about CPUs architecture, cache coherency and memory
barriers, make it this one.It is a clear and well written article. It even has
a quiz. What's it about?So what possessed CPU designers to cause them to
inﬂict memory barriers on poor unsuspecting SMP software designers?In short,
because reordering memory references allows much better performance, and so
memory barriers are needed to force ordering in things like synchronization
primitives whose correct operation depends on ordered memory
references.Getting a more detailed answer to this question requires a good
understanding of how CPU caches work, and especially what is required to make
caches really work well. The following sections:present the structure of a
cache,describe how cache-coherency protocols ensure that CPUs agree on the
value of each location</p><p>4 0.86699879 <a title="1471-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-02-Total_Cost_of_Ownership_for_different_web_development_frameworks.html">338 high scalability-2008-06-02-Total Cost of Ownership for different web development frameworks</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you don't cannibalize yourself, someone else will. --Steve Jobs  America as
the New World has a long history of inspiring Utopian communities. Early
experiments were famously religious. But there have been many others as new
waves of thought have inspired people to organize and try something
different.In the 1840s Transcendentalists, believing the true path lay in the
perfection of the individual, created intentional communities likeBrook Farm.
We've also seensocialist, anarchist,hippy, and virtually every other kind of
Utopia in-between. Psychologist B.F. Skinner wrote an infamous book,Walden
Two, with a more "scientific" take on creating a Utopian community and Ayn
Rand inAtlas Shrugged had her free market version.I believe in startup
organizations we see the modern version of Utopian energy in action. We now
call it by names like "culture hacking", but the goal is the same: to create a
new form of human community to achieve a profound goal. You may think startups
are only about m</p><p>6 0.8558979 <a title="1471-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-25-Product%3A_3_PAR_REMOTE_COPY.html">27 high scalability-2007-07-25-Product: 3 PAR REMOTE COPY</a></p>

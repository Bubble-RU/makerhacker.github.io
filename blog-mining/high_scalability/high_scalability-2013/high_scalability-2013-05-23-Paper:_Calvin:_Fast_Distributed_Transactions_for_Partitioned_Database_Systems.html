<p>Introduction: Advertising for the Super Bowl is bigger than the game for many viewers. So
you gotta figure advertisers are ready for the traffic bursts generated by
their expensive ads? Not exactly...Yottaareports an amazing 13 advertiser
websites crashedduring the Super Bowl. Coke was interactively au currant,
asking viewers to vote for the ending of a commercial, but load times went to
62 seconds. SodaStream, Calvin Klein, Axe, Got Milk? The Walking Dead, many
movie sites, and many car sites, all were flagged with delay of fame
penalties.Lots of time, money, and creative energy is spent lovingly
perfecting every detail of these commercials. It won't be a surprise to any
programmer that this can't usually be said of the follow through on the
backend.So what can you do? Yottaa has some good tips and Michael Hamrah has a
wonderful post on dealing with the Super Bowl Burst Problem:Yottaa's

<p>Introduction: A lot of people seem to passionately dislike the termNewSQL, or pretty much
any newly coined term for that matter, but after watching Alex Lloyd, Senior
Staff Software Engineer Google, give a great talkon Building Spanner, that's
the term that fits Spanner best.Spanner wraps the SQL + transaction model of
OldSQL around the reworked bones of a globally distributed NoSQL system. That
seems NewSQL to me.As Spanner is a not so distant cousin of BigTable, the
NoSQL component should be no surprise. Spanner is charged with spanning
millions of machines inside any number of geographically distributed
datacenters. What is surprising is how OldSQL has been embraced. In anearlier
2011 talkgiven by Alex at the HotStorage conference, the reason for embracing
OldSQL was the desire to make it easier and faster for programmers to build
applications. The main ideas will seem quite familiar:There's a false
dichotomy between little complicated databases and huge, scalable, simple
ones. We can have featur</p><p>5 0.087841257 <a title="1463-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-16-Paper%3A_Warp%3A_Multi-Key_Transactions_for_Key-Value_Stores.html">1459 high scalability-2013-05-16-Paper: Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Looks like an interesting take on "a completely asynchronous, low-latency
transaction management protocol, in line with the fully distributed NoSQL
architecture."Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores
overview:Implementing ACID transactions has been a longstanding challenge for
NoSQL systems. Because these systems are based on a sharded architecture,
transactions necessarily require coordination across multiple servers. Past
work in this space has relied either on heavyweight protocols such as Paxos or
clock synchronization for this coordination.This paper presents a novel
protocol for coordinating distributed transactions with ACID semantics on top
of a sharded data store. Called linear transactions, this protocol achieves
scalability by distributing the coordination task to only those servers that
hold relevant data for each transaction. It achieves high performance by
serializing only those transactions whose concurrent execution could

<p>Introduction: We are not yet at the End of History for database theory asPeter Bailisand
theDatabase Groupat UC Berkeley continue to prove with a greatcompanion blog
post to their new paper: Scalable Atomic Visibility with RAMP Transactions. I
like the approach of pairing a blog post with a paper. A paper almost by
definition is formal, but a blog post can help put a paper in context and give
it some heart.From the abstract:Databases can provide scalability by
partitioning data across several servers. However, multi-partition, multi-
operation transactional access is often expensive, employing coordination-
intensive locking, validation, or scheduling mechanisms. Accordingly, many
real-world systems avoid mechanisms that provide useful semantics formulti-
partition operations. This leads to incorrect behavior for a large class of
applications including secondary indexing,foreign key enforcement, and
materialized view maintenance. In this work, we identify a new isolation model

many the strong guarantees of standard RDBMSdistributed transactionsare too

system for Yahoo!'s web applications. PNUTS provides data storage organized as

<p>Introduction: Hi...I have this idea to start a really great and scalable website, and I am
building it! So far I'm doing everything myself - coding, networking,
architecture planning, everything. I haven't even gotten into the legal
aspects yet.......It would be MUCH easier if I had a technical person to
handle that end of the operation. I'm a good coder, but like Bill Gates at
Harvard for Math, I'm not the very best. I'd like to FIND that very best
person available, to handle the technical aspects. For worse or better, I
don't presently know somebody who fits this bill.I've posted a bazillion ads
on Craig's List, with no really qualified responses. I've put out feelers
among my own network, same result. Not sure what else I can do. Shoestring
budget, so it's sweat equity in the beginning. That can actually be a plus, as
it forces people to focus.Any ideas about what else I can do, to attract the
right person?ThanksJason</p><p>2 0.93047833 <a title="1463-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-17-Database_People_Hating_on_MapReduce.html">216 high scalability-2008-01-17-Database People Hating on MapReduce</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Distributed transactions are costly because they useagreement protocols.
Calvin says, surprisingly, that using a deterministic database allows you to
avoid the use of agreement protocols. The approach is to use a deterministic
transaction layer that does all the hard work before acquiring locks and the
beginning of transaction execution.Overview:Many distributed storage systems
achieve high data access throughput via partitioning and replication, each
system with its own advantages and tradeoffs. In order to achieve high
scalability, however, today's systems generally reduce transactional support,
disallowing single transactions from spanning multiple partitions. Calvin is a
practical transaction scheduling and data replication layer that uses a
deterministic ordering guarantee to signiďŹ cantly reduce the normally
prohibitive contention costs associated with distributed transactions. Unlike
previous deterministic database system prototypes, Calvin supports disk-based
storage, scales nea</p><p>5 0.87123263 <a title="1463-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-04-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_4%2C_2011.html">999 high scalability-2011-03-04-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 4, 2011</a></p>

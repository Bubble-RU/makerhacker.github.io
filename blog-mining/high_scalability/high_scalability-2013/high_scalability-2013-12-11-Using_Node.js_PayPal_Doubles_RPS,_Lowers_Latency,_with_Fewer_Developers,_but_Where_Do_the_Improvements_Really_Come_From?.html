</p><p>7 The power of the USL is it can pinpoint which factors are to blame for non-linear scaling. [sent-18, score-0.14]
</p><p>8 The findings:Notice that Java's sigma (serialization) parameter is lower and its kappa (crosstalk) parameter is higher than Node. [sent-19, score-0.254]
</p><p>9 This means that Java is bottlenecked less on serialization, and Node. [sent-22, score-0.298]
</p><p>10 This is exactly what one should expect from their architectures (multi-threaded versus single-threaded with event loop) and their blog post ("using a single core for the node. [sent-24, score-0.161]
</p><p>11 That's unclear and is a good topic for a much deeper dive into the stack. [sent-32, score-0.145]
</p><p>12 Baron surmises:My guess is that Node is encouraging good programmer practices in terms of scalability, and Java less so. [sent-34, score-0.412]
</p><p>13 In other words, programmers probably have to work less hard to avoid bad scalability bottlenecks in Node than in Java Lots more details in Baron's excellent post. [sent-35, score-0.179]
</p><p>14 There are also some good comments on the post, reinforcing the idea that doing the more parallel thing may be just easier in Node. [sent-36, score-0.236]

</p><p>16 I've find the same thing in our experience at Arqball while switching to node -- many applications have become *much* faster when rewritten for node thanks simply to getting work done while waiting on "slow" events (db, disk, cpu). [sent-39, score-0.848]
</p><p>17 Of course this concurrency is also possible with other technologies (Ruby in our case), but in practice we would only multi-thread applications if performance became a bottleneck for us. [sent-40, score-0.07]

World folks were very nice and did a good job, so there's no blame on them

is being expended on leveraging the Java platform to meet scalability

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Greg Luck Founder and CTO,EhcacheTerracotta Inc.Note:
this article contains a bit too much of a product pitch, but the points are
still generally valid and useful.The legendary Moore's Law, which states that
the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on an integrated
circuit doubles approximately every two years, has held true since 1965. It
follows that integrated circuits will continue to get smaller, with chip
fabrication currently at a minuscule 22nm process (1). Users of big iron
hardware, or servers that are dense in terms of CPU power and memory capacity,
benefit from this trend as their hardware becomes cheaper and more powerful
over time. At some point soon, however, density limits imposed by quantum
mechanics will preclude further density increases.At the same time, low-cost
commodity hardware influences enterprise architects to scale their
applications horizontally, where processing is spread across clusters of low-
cost commodity serv</p><p>4 0.13788822 <a title="1563-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-14-Using_Gossip_Protocols_for_Failure_Detection%2C_Monitoring%2C_Messaging_and_Other_Good_Things.html">1142 high scalability-2011-11-14-Using Gossip Protocols for Failure Detection, Monitoring, Messaging and Other Good Things</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When building a system on top of a set of wildly uncooperative and unruly
computers you have knowledge problems: knowing when other nodes are dead;
knowing when nodes become alive; getting information about other nodes so you
can make local decisions, like knowing which node should handle a request
based on a scheme for assigning nodes to a certain range of users; learning
about new configuration data; agreeing on data values; and so on.How do you
solve these problems? A common centralized approach is to use a database and
all nodes query it for information. Obvious availability and performance
issues for large distributed clusters. Another approach is to use Paxos, a
protocol for solving consensus in a network to maintain strict consistency
requirements for small groups of unreliable processes. Not practical when
larger number of nodes are involved.So what's the super cool decentralized way
to bring order to large clusters?Gossip protocols, which maintain relaxed
consistency requireme</p><p>5 0.13024084 <a title="1563-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-07-Paper%3A_Architecture_of_a_Highly_Scalable_NIO-Based_Server.html">113 high scalability-2007-10-07-Paper: Architecture of a Highly Scalable NIO-Based Server</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ebay[1]Starts in 1995, initial name AuctionWeb (V1) :- very simple
architecture- based on perl- no database, for data persistence they used plain
filesBecause of rapid growth they needed to improve their architecture and so
V2 (clever name) was born:- replaced perl with C/C++- started using a database
in a master-slave configuration- C++ back-end- XSLT front-endAny request will
lead to an XML file being created in C++ and the XLST processor will transform
that into html.*pretty sophisticated architecture for the 90s, XLST was
cutting-edge back then*breakThat hold out pretty well for a while but in the
late 90s ebay experienced an exponential growth.They started having some
trouble with outages and needed improvements, so V3 was developed:- based on
java- search engine still used C++- proof that relational databases can scale
(aggressive caching)- developed a messaging layer for making a lot of

Java VMs. It provides up to a terabyte of virtual heap for Java applications
that spans hundreds of connected JVMs.NAM is best suited for storing what they
call scratch data. Scratch data is defined as object oriented data that is
critical to the execution of a series of Java operations inside the JVM, but
may not be critical once a business transaction is complete.The Terracotta
Architecture has three components:Client Nodes - Each client node corresponds
to a client node in the cluster which runs on a standard JVMServer Cluster -

<p>Introduction: Why is there something rather than nothing? That's the kind of question
theLarge Hadron Colliderin CERN is hopefully poised to answer. And what is the
output of this beautiful 17-mile long,6 billion dollar wabi-sabishproton
smashing machine? Data. Great heaping torrents of Grand Canyon sized data. 15
million gigabytes every year. That's 1000 times the information printed in
books every year. It's so much data 10,000 scientists will use agridof80,000+
computers, in 300 computer centers , in 50 different countries just to help
make sense of it all.How will all this data be collected, transported, stored,
and analyzed? It turns out, using what amounts to sort of Internet of
Particles instead of an Internet of Things.Two good articles have recently
shed some electro-magnetic energy in the human visible spectrum on the IT
aspects of the collider:LHC computing grid pushes petabytes of data, beats

<p>Introduction: If like many humans you've found evenPaxos Made Simplea bit difficult to
understand, you might enjoy RAFT as described inIn Search of an Understandable
Consensus Algorithm by Stanford'sDiego Ongaroand John Ousterhout. The video
presentation of the paper is given byJohn Ousterhout. Both the paper and the
video are delightfully accessible.mcherm has a good summary of the paper:A
consensus algorithm is: a cluster of servers should record a series of records
("log entries") in response to requests from clients of the cluster. (It may
also take action based on those entries.) It does so in a way that guarantees
that the responses seen by clients of the cluster will be consistent EVEN in
the face of servers crashing in unpredictable ways (but not loosing data that
was synched to disk), and networks introducing unpredictable delays or
communication blockages.Here's what Raft does. First, it elects a leader, then
the leader records the master version of the log, telling other cluster
servers w</p><p>3 0.95805025 <a title="1563-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-16-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_June_16%2C_2010.html">842 high scalability-2010-06-16-Hot Scalability Links for June 16, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You're Doing it Wrong by Poul-Henning Kamp. Don't look so guilty, he's not
talking about you know what, he's talking about writing high-performance
server programs: Not just wrong as in not perfect, but wrong as in wasting
half, or more, of your performance. What good is an O(log2(n)) algorithm if
those operations cause page faults and slow disk operations? For most relevant
datasets an O(n) or even an O(n^2) algorithm, which avoids page faults, will
run circles around it. A Microsoft Windows Azure primer: the basicsby Peter
Bright. Nice article explaining the basics of Azure and how it compares to
Google and Amazon.A call to change the name from NoSQL to Postmodern
Databases. Interesting idea, but the problem is the same one I have for
Postmodern Art, when is it? I always feel like I'm in the post-post modern
period, yet for art it's really in the early 1900s. Let's save future
developers from this existential time crisis.Constructions from Dots and

<p>Introduction: PayPal gives yet another glowing reportof an app rewritten in node.js
experiencing substantial performance improvements. PayPal rewrote their
account overview page, one of the most trafficked apps on the website, which
was previously written in King Java.The benefits:Full-stack engineers. Using
JavaScript on both the front-end and the back-end removed an artificial
boundary between the browser and server, allowing engineers to code both.Built
almost twice as fast with fewer people Written in 33% fewer lines of code
Constructed with 40% fewer filesDouble the requests per second vs. the Java
application.35% decrease in the average response time for the same page.A
common pro Java response is an argument like clearly these people don't know
how to program Java. Or rewriting an application usually makes it faster. Or
the benchmark is faulty. And so on. Consider it noted. These are all potential
factors.Baron Schwartzfrom VividCortex has a different take. One based on
math.

<p>Introduction: I remember the excitement of when Twitter first opened up their firehose. As
an early adopter of the Twitter API I could easily imagine some of the cool
things you could do with all that data. I also remember the disappointment of
learning that in the land of BigData, data has a price, and that price would
be too high for little fish like me. It was like learning for the first time
there would be no BigData Santa Clause.For a while though I had the pleasure
of pondering just how I would handle all that data. It's a fascinating
problem. You have to be able to reliably consume it, normalize it, merge it
with other data, apply functions on it, store it, query it, distribute it, and
oh yah, monetize it. Most of that in realish-time. And if you are trying to
create a platform for allowing the entire Internet do to the same thing to the
firehose, the challenge is exponentially harder.DataSift is in the exciting
position of creating just such a firehose eating, data chomping machine. You

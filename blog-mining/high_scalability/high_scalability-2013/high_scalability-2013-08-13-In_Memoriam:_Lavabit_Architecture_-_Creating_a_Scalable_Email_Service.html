<p>Introduction: How do you query hundreds of gigabytes of new data each day streaming in from
over 600 hyperactive servers? If you think this sounds like the perfect battle
ground for a head-to-head skirmish in the greatMapReduce Versus Database War,
you would be correct.Bill Boebel, CTO of Mailtrust (Rackspace's mail
division), has generously provided a fascinating account of how they evolved
their log processing system from an early amoeba'ic text file stored on each
machine approach, to a Neandertholic relational database solution that just
couldn't compete, and finally to a Homo sapien'ic Hadoop based solution that
works wisely for them and has virtually unlimited scalability
potential.Rackspace faced a now familiar problem. Lots and lots of data
streaming in. Where do you store all that data? How do you do anything useful
with it? In the first version of their system logs were stored in flat text
files and had to be manually searched by engineers logging into each
individual machine. Then came a</p><p>3 0.25824234 <a title="1501-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-25-Any_Suggestions_for_the_Architecture_Template%3F.html">259 high scalability-2008-02-25-Any Suggestions for the Architecture Template?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:Jake inDoes Django really scale better than Rails?thinks apps like FFS
shouldn't need so much hardware to scale.In a short three months Friends for
Sale (think Hot-or-Not with a market economy) grew to become a top 10 Facebook
application handling 200 gorgeous requests per second and a stunning 300
million page views a month. They did all this using Ruby on Rails, two part
time developers, a cluster of a dozen machines, and a fairly standard
architecture. How did Friends for Sale scale to sell all those beautiful
people? And how much do you think your friends are worth on the open market?

<p>Introduction: Mollomis one of those cool SaaS companies every developer dreams of creating
when they wrack their brains looking for a viable software-as-a-service
startup. Mollom profitably runs a useful service--spam filtering--with a small
group of geographically distributed developers. Mollom helps protect nearly
40,000 websites from spam, includingone of mine, which is where I first
learned about Mollom. In a desperate attempt to stop spam on a Drupal site,
where every other form of CAPTCHA had failed miserably, I installed Mollom in
about 10 minutes and it immediately started working. That's the out of the box
experience I was looking for.From the time Mollom opened its digital
inspection system they've rejected over 373 million spams and in the process
they've learned that a stunning 90% of all messages are spam. This spam
torrent is handled by only two geographically distributed machines that handle
100 requests/ second, each running a Java application server and Cassandra. So

messages aren't the major architectural challenge, handling user presence

Ruby code were upgraded and virtualization was removed. The result:A 66 %

<p>Introduction: Here's anUpdate On Disqus: It's Still About Realtime, But Go Demolishes
Python.How do you add realtime functionality to a web scale application?
That's whatAdam Hitchcock, a Software Engineer at Disqus talks about in an
excellent talk: Making DISQUS Realtime (slides).Disqus had to take their
commenting system and add realtime capabilities to it. Not something that's
easy to do when at the time of the talk (2013) they had had just hit a billion
unique visitors a month.What Disqus developed is a realtime commenting system
called "realertime" that was tested to handle 1.5 million concurrently
connected users, 45,000 new connections per second, 165,000 messages/second,
with less than .2 seconds latency end-to-end.The nature of a commenting system
is that it is IO bound and has a high fanout, that is a comment comes in and
must be sent out to a lot of readers. It's a problem very similar to
whatTwitter must solve. Disqus' solution was quite interesting as was the path
to their solution. The</p><p>6 0.83319104 <a title="1501-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-06-Product%3A_Perdition_Mail_Retrieval_Proxy.html">80 high scalability-2007-09-06-Product: Perdition Mail Retrieval Proxy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Write a little "Hello World" program these days and it runs inside a
bewildering Russian Doll of nested environments, each layer adding its own
special performance and complexity tax. First, a language executes in its own
environment of data structure libraries, memory management, and so on. That,
more often than not, will run inside a language VM like the JVM, CLR, or V8.
The language VM will in-turn run inside a process that runs inside an OS. An
application will run in one or more threads inside a process. And the whole
thing will run inside a machine sharing VM layer like Xen. And across all of
that are frameworks for monitoring, elasticity, storage, and so on. That's a
lot of overhead for a such a little program.What if we could remove all these
taxes and run directly on the new bare metal, which some consider to be a
combination of Machine VM + Cloud API? That's exactly what a system
calledMirage, described in the paperTurning down the LAMP: Software

<p>Introduction: ThePort Network's Director of Engineering, TJ Muehleman was kind of enough to
share some of the architectural details for their white label social media
system. It currently runs about 50 social networks varying in size from less
than 1000 members to more than 300,000 members, all on a Microsoft stack. In
addition to their social networking platform, they offer Javascript APIs and
web service APIs (both REST and SOAP) which account for a significant
percentage of overall system usage.ThePort is an excellent example of a real
world in-the-trenches product offering real value to customers. One of the
most interesting problems they have to solve is multi-tenancy. How do you
provide good performance, complete customization, support, develop new
features, and provide individual search indexes for each customer? It's not an
easy problem to solve.How did they solve their problems and build a successful
system? Site: http://theport.comPlatformMicrosoft.NET 3.5C# / VB.NETSQL Server

140,000 registered users with more than 260,000 email addresses. While most of
our accounts belong to individual users, we also provide corporate email

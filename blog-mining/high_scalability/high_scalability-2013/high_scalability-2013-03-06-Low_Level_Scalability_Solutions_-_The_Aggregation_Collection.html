</p><p>4 Preventing Cascading FailuresThe most treacherous example of why prioritizing work is important is in preventing cascading failures. [sent-12, score-0.469]
</p><p>5 Naive systems, without an idea of priority, will let useless control or data plane traffic elbow out essential control traffic when failures occur. [sent-13, score-0.696]
</p><p>6 If you need to send a request to a switch to reprogram a route to failover traffic and there's head-of-line blocking on a low priority work item, then you'll never be able to get control of your system without shutting the whole thing down. [sent-14, score-0.873]

</p><p>10 You'll have intelligent retry policies so useless work doesn't pile up in queues. [sent-19, score-0.386]
</p><p>11 When the newest save the day control message is available current work is stopped so the higher priority item can be processed and it's messages will go out immediately as apposed to sitting back and waiting. [sent-22, score-0.885]
</p><p>12 When we talk about using priority we are also talking about how a system can react smartly and predictably under fully loaded conditions. [sent-28, score-0.502]
</p><p>13 You have a high priority client that has paid for better service than the rabble. [sent-35, score-0.41]

<p>Introduction: There's not a lot  of talk about application architectures at the process
level. You have your threads, pools of threads, and you have your callback
models. That's about it. Languages/frameworks making a virtue out of simple
models, like Go and Erlang, do so at the price of control. It's difficult to
make a low latency well conditioned application when a power full tool, like
work scheduling, is taken out of the hands of the programmer.But that's not
all there is my friend. We'll dive into different ways an application can be
composed across threads of control.Your favorite language may not give you
access to all the capabilities we are going to talk about, but lately there
has been a sort of revival in considering performance important, especially
for controlling latency variance, so I think it's time to talk about these
kind of issues. When it was do everything in the thread of a web server thread
pool none of these issues really mattered. But now that developers are

<p>Introduction: Hidden in every computer is a hardware backplane for moving signals around.
Hidden in every application are ways of moving messages around and giving code
CPU time to process them. Unhiding those capabilities and making them first
class facilities for the programmer to control is the idea behind
AppBackplane.This goes directly against the trend of hiding everything from
the programmer and doing it all automagically. Which is great, until it
doesn't work. Then it sucks. And the approach of giving the programmer all the
power also sucks, until it's tuned to work together and performance is
incredible even under increasing loads. Then it's great.These are two
different curves going in opposite directions. You need to decide for your
application which curve you need to be on.AppBackplane is an example framework

As Loads Increase we talked about problems. In this first post (OK, there was
an earlier post, but I'm doing some reorganizing), we'll cover what I

suggestions of how to structure the components of your code and how they
interact. We're not talking about massive scale-out clusters here, but of what
your applications might like like internally, way below the service level
interface level. There's a lot more to the world than evented
architectures.Aggregation simply means we aren't using stupid queues. Our
queues will be smart. We are deeply aware of queues as containers of work that
eventually dictate how the entire system performs. As work containers we know
intimately what requests and data sit in our queues and we can use that
intelligence to our great advantage.Prioritize WorkThe key idea to it all is

<p>Introduction: With BigData comes BigStorage costs. One way to store less is simplynot to
store the same data twice. That's the radically simple and powerful notion
behind data deduplication. If you are one of those who got a good laugh out of
the idea of eliminating SQL queries as a rather obvious scalability strategy,
you'll love this one, but it is a powerful feature and one I don't hear talked
about outside the enterprise. A parallel idea in programming is the once-and-
only-once principle of never duplicating code.Using deduplication technology,
for some upfront CPU usage, which is a plentiful resource in many systems that
are IO bound anyway, it's possible to reduce storage requirements by upto
20:1, depending on your data, which saves both money and disk write overhead.
This comes up because of really good article Robin Harris of StorageMojo
wrote, All de-dup works, on a paper,  A Study of Practical Deduplication by

<p>Introduction: We talked about42 Monster Problems That Attack As Loads Increase. Here are a
few ways you can defend yourself, secrets revealed by scaling masters across
the ages. Note that these are low level programming level moves, not large
architecture type strategies.Use Resources Proportional To a Fixed LimitThis
is probably the most important rule for achieving scalability within an
application. What it means:Find the resource that has a fixed limit that you
know you can support. For example, a guarantee to handle a certain number of
objects in memory. So if we always use resources proportional to the number of
objects it is likely we can prevent resource exhaustion.Devise ways of tying
what you need to do to the individual resources.Some examples:Keep a list of
purchase orders with line items over $20 (or whatever). Do not keep a list of
the line items because the number of items can be much larger than the number
of purchase orders. You have kept the resource usage proportional to the
number</p><p>5 0.93799686 <a title="1418-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-29-Pinboard.in_Architecture_-_Pay_to_Play_to_Keep_a_System_Small__.html">965 high scalability-2010-12-29-Pinboard.in Architecture - Pay to Play to Keep a System Small  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you keep a system small enough, while still being successful, that a
simple scale-up strategy becomes the preferred architecture?StackOverflow, for
example, could stick with a tool chain they were comfortable with because they
had a natural brake on how fast they could grow: there are only so many
programmers in the world. If this doesn't work for you, here's another natural
braking strategy to consider:charge for your service.Paul Houlesummarized this
nicely as:avoid scaling problems by building a service that's profitable at a
small scale.This interesting point, one I hadn't properly considered before,
was brought up by Maciej Ceglowski, co-founder ofPinboard.in, in an interview
with Leo Laporte and Amber MacArthur on their theirnet@nightshow.Pinboard is a
lean, mean, pay for bookmarking machine, a timely replacement for the nearly
departed Delicious. And as a self professed anti-social bookmarking site, it

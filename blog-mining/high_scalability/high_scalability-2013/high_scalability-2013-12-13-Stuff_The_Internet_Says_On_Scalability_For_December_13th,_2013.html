leaves childish things behind and becomes areal product.Pricing will change.
Architectures will change. Customers will change. Hearts and minds will
change. But Google App Engine will survive. Google isshutting downmany of

<p>Introduction: Constructing a scalablerisk analysis solution is a fascinating architectural
challenge. If you come from Financial Services you are sure to appreciate
that. But even architects from other domains are bound to find the challenges
fascinating, and the architectural patterns of my suggested solution highly
useful in other domains.Recently I held an interesting webinar around
architecting solutions for scalable and near-real-time risk analysis solutions
based on experience gathered with Financial Services customers. Seeing the
vast interest in the webinar, I would like to share the highlights with you
here.From an architectural point of view, risk analysis is a data-intensive
and a compute-intensive process, which also has an elaborate orchestration
logic. volumes in this domain are massive and ever-increasing, together with
an ever-increasing demand to reduce response time. These trends are aggravated
by global financial regulatory reforms set following the late-2000s financial
crisis, wh</p><p>5 0.92777002 <a title="1564-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-16-Scaling_Secret_%232%3A_Denormalizing_Your_Way_to_Speed_and_Profit.html">65 high scalability-2007-08-16-Scaling Secret #2: Denormalizing Your Way to Speed and Profit</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alan Watts once observed how after we accepted Descartes' separation of the
mind and body we've been trying to smash them back together again ever since
when really they were never separate to begin with.The database normalization-
denormalization dualism has the same mobius shaped reverberations as
Descartes' error. We separate data into a million jagged little pieces and
then spend all our time stooping over, picking them and up, and joining them
back together again.Normalization has been standard practice now for decades.
But times are changing. Many mega-website architects are concluding Watts was
right: the data was never separate to begin with. And even more radical, we
may even need to store multiple copies of data.breakInformation

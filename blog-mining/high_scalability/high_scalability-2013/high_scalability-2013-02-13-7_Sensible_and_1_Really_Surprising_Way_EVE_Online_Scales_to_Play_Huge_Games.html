</p><p>14 When a fleet enters a new system the session change overhead has a huge impact. [sent-32, score-0.358]

</p><p>17 It's like how time goes slow-mo during an accident, but it happens for everyone playing the game, instead of some people experiencing the game in real-time and others experience an unresponsive client. [sent-39, score-0.479]
</p><p>18 Time Dilation is not the same as lag, where your client is out of sync with the game state because there aren't enough cycles or network to keep clients up to date. [sent-43, score-0.378]
</p><p>19 By slowing down time the game can process more missles (or whatever) so clients can be kept in sync. [sent-44, score-0.482]

<p>Introduction: Sorry, the content for this post apparently did not make the transition from
the old HighScalability website, it's all messed up, but there's still a some
useful content...EVE Onlineis "The World's Largest Game Universe", a massively
multiplayer online game (MMO) made by CCP. EVE Online's Architecture is
unusual for a MMOG because it doesn't divide the player load among different
servers or shards. Instead, the same cluster handles the entire EVE universe.
It is an interesting to compare this with theArchitecture of the Second Life
Grid. How do they manage to scale?Information SourcesEVE Insider Dev BlogEVE

<p>Introduction: In a really far ranging and insightful interview by Steve Peterson: Game
Industry Legends: Rob Pardo, where the future of gaming is discussed, there
was a section on how the cloud might be used in games. I know there are a lot
of game developers in my audience, so I thought it might be useful:Q. If the
game is free-to-play but I have to download 10 gigabytes to try it out, that
can keep me from trying it. That's part of what cloud gaming is trying to
overcome; do you think cloud gaming is going to make some inroads because of
those technical issues? Rob Pardo: I certainly think there's a lot of
potential in cloud gaming, it's just picking the right games. There's a lot of
hurdles for cloud gaming to overcome, one of which is having to have all these
servers to be able to host all these games, since it's not like you need any
less computing power to play these games. First of all you need someone with
the infrastructure that can have all those games up there. Another issue the

<p>Introduction: Ten million players a day and over fifty million players a month interact
socially with friends usingPlayfishgames on social platforms like The
Facebook, MySpace, and the iPhone. Playfish was an early innovator in the
fastest growing segment of the game industry:social gaming, which is the love
child between casual gaming and social networking. Playfish was also an early
adopter of the Amazon cloud, running their system entirely on 100s of cloud
servers. Playfish finds itself at the nexus of some hot trends (which may by
why EA bought them for$300 millionand they think a$1 billion gameis possible):
building games on social networks, build applications in the cloud, mobile
gaming, leveraging data driven design to continuously evolve and improve
systems, agile development and deployment, andselling virtual goodas a

<p>Introduction: Update:As expected I'm undergoing a massive spam attack for speaking truth to
dark powers. This is the time to be strong. Together we can make a change.
What change you may ask? I can't say, just change and lots more change. Let's
link arms together and bravely stand against the forces of chaos for a better
yesterday and a better tomorrow.CAPTCHA doesn't work. Even Google can't make
CAPTCHA work (Spammers Choose GMail). And even if CAPTCHA worked it wouldn't
really work because CAPTCHA solving markets (Inside India's CAPTCHA solving
economy) have evolved where for a mere $2 you can buy 1000 human broken
CAPTCHA's. And we know once the free market tackles a problem that's it. Game
over :-)Making ever more clever CAPTCHA programs won't outwit and outlast the
CAPTCHA solving markets. Until Skynet evolves the only way to defeat humans is
with humans.Using Games to Get Humans to Do Work (like CAPTCHA) for FreeHow do

<p>Introduction: "Online games and virtual worlds have familiar scaling requirements, but don’t
be fooled: everything you know is wrong." Jim Waldo, Sun Microsystems
Laboratories* The computational environment for online games or virtual worlds
is close to the exact inverse of that found in most markets serviced by the
high-tech industry.* The need for a heavyweight client is, in part, an outcome
of the evolution of these games.* Latency is the enemy of fun—and therefore
the enemy of online games and virtual worlds.* The game server is used both to
discourage cheating (by making it much more difficult) and to detect cheating
(by seeing patterns of divergence between the game state reported by the
client and the game state held by the server). Peer-to-peer technologies might

<p>Introduction: Update:As expected I'm undergoing a massive spam attack for speaking truth to
dark powers. This is the time to be strong. Together we can make a change.
What change you may ask? I can't say, just change and lots more change. Let's
link arms together and bravely stand against the forces of chaos for a better
yesterday and a better tomorrow.CAPTCHA doesn't work. Even Google can't make
CAPTCHA work (Spammers Choose GMail). And even if CAPTCHA worked it wouldn't
really work because CAPTCHA solving markets (Inside India's CAPTCHA solving
economy) have evolved where for a mere $2 you can buy 1000 human broken
CAPTCHA's. And we know once the free market tackles a problem that's it. Game
over :-)Making ever more clever CAPTCHA programs won't outwit and outlast the
CAPTCHA solving markets. Until Skynet evolves the only way to defeat humans is
with humans.Using Games to Get Humans to Do Work (like CAPTCHA) for FreeHow do
we harness the power of humans to do battle with the CAPTCHA solving networ</p><p>5 0.83519697 <a title="1405-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-17-World_of_Warcraft%27s_Lead_designer_Rob_Pardo_on_the_Role_of_the_Cloud_in_Games.html">1342 high scalability-2012-10-17-World of Warcraft's Lead designer Rob Pardo on the Role of the Cloud in Games</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a really far ranging and insightful interview by Steve Peterson: Game
Industry Legends: Rob Pardo, where the future of gaming is discussed, there
was a section on how the cloud might be used in games. I know there are a lot
of game developers in my audience, so I thought it might be useful:Q. If the
game is free-to-play but I have to download 10 gigabytes to try it out, that
can keep me from trying it. That's part of what cloud gaming is trying to
overcome; do you think cloud gaming is going to make some inroads because of
those technical issues? Rob Pardo: I certainly think there's a lot of
potential in cloud gaming, it's just picking the right games. There's a lot of
hurdles for cloud gaming to overcome, one of which is having to have all these
servers to be able to host all these games, since it's not like you need any
less computing power to play these games. First of all you need someone with
the infrastructure that can have all those games up there. Another issue the

<p>Introduction: Debugging complex problems is 90% persistence and 50% cool tools. Brendan
Gregg in10 Performance Wins tells a fascinating story of how a team at Joyent
solved some weird and challenging performance issues deep in the OS. It took
lots of effort,DTrace, Flame Graphs,USE Method, and writing custom tools when
necessary. Here's a quick summary of the solved cases:Monitoring. 1000x
improvement. An application blocked while paging anonymous memory back in. It
was also blocked during file system fsync() calls. The application was
misconfigured and sometimes briefly exceeded available memory, getting page
out.Riak. 2x improvement. The Erlang VM used half the CPU count it was
supposed to, so CPUs remained unused.  Fix was a configuration change.MySQL.
380x improvement. Reads were slow. Cause was correlated writes. Fix was to
tune the cache flush interval on the storage controller.Various. 2800x
improvement. Large systems calls to getvmusage() could take a few seconds.

<p>Introduction: "Everything in war is simple, but theďťż simplest thing is difficult." -- Carl
von ClausewitzGames are proving grounds for software architecture. They
combine scale, high performance, challenging problems, a rabid user base, cost
sensitivity, and the need for profit. And when games have in-game currency,
like EVE Online has, there's money at play, so you can't just get away with a
c'est la vie attitude. Engineering must be applied. InPlanning for war: how
the EVE Online servers deal with a 3,000 person battle, we learn some
techniques EVE Online uses to handle large games:7 Sensible...Do nothing.Most
games are manageable or have spikes that quickly dissipate. Run it Hot.
There's nothing to throttle as servers run at 100%. Why waste money? Use all
your CPU.Shard it. Games are sharded by solar system and multiple solar
systems run on a node.Move it. Games are moved when a machine becomes
overloaded. Live Node Remap, where a live game is moved to a new node without
disconnecting users, is n</p><p>4 0.88774526 <a title="1405-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-14-SharePoint_VPS_solution.html">1579 high scalability-2014-01-14-SharePoint VPS solution</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Launched in 2001 by Microsoft, since then this platform is widely popular
among organizations to increase the efficiency of their business and
productive volume. As we all know the importance of communication mode in
every organization and by keeping in the mind this fact, Microsoft SharePoint
communicates over all barriers and spread the required information within a
company.Microsoft SharePoint is an ideal solution for companies who have
multiple offices and staff members who are on the move. Using SharePoint,
documents and other materials can be easily shared with both colleagues and
managers. Other features include advanced document management, which allows
users to virtually check out a document, modify it or just read it, then check
in the document again. This allows managers/company owners to see exactly when
their staff members are working and just what they are doing. When combined
with a highly customizable workflow management system and group calendars,
SharePoint can improv</p><p>5 0.88520783 <a title="1405-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-10-Managing_cross_partition_transactions_in_a_distributed_KV_system.html">625 high scalability-2009-06-10-Managing cross partition transactions in a distributed KV system</a></p>

[sent-13, score-2.214]
</p><p>2 Priority Inheritance- is a way of getting out of priority inversion problems by assuring that a task which holds a resource will execute at the priority of the highest priority task blocked on that resource. [sent-14, score-1.777]
</p><p>3 Shared Locks- When there's a shared lock anywhere we are back to potentially poor scheduling because the high priority task must wait on the low priority task. [sent-20, score-1.715]
</p><p>4 This requires anyone who shares the lock to know there is high priority work and never to take more time than the worst case performance needed for the high priority work. [sent-21, score-1.511]
</p><p>5 You suffer from dead lock or priority inheritance or large lock scope, but after bugs are accounted for, it may simply be that you have higher priority tasks that are using up all the CPU time, so even medium priority tasks in your system end up not getting serviced. [sent-42, score-2.15]
</p><p>6 It is lock protected shared data structures that cause latency issues, deadlock, and priority inheritance. [sent-67, score-0.963]
</p><p>7 An application that uses multiple threads and has a lock usable just within the application may not, if care is taken, suffer from the same problems as when locks are arbitrarily used from different application threads. [sent-74, score-0.86]
</p><p>8 A single application can:guarantee the amount of time spent blocked on the lockprevent deadlock because it probably won't do work in different threadsprevent priority inheritanceWhen different components share a process space nothing can can be guaranteed. [sent-75, score-1.015]
</p><p>9 Your application state is shared amongst all these threads and there's no predictable order of when threads run and what work they are doing. [sent-100, score-0.961]
</p><p>10 There's no shared state in this model so it eliminates locks which eliminates priority inheritance and deadlock issues. [sent-114, score-1.384]
</p><p>11 As an Actor is processing a message it can't be interrupted if a higher priority message arrives. [sent-116, score-1.053]
</p><p>12 If a higher priority message comes in on the queue then a thread variable "GiveUpWork" is set. [sent-119, score-1.18]
</p><p>13 An implication is to change the Actor's priority accordingly with the highest priority work in its queue. [sent-121, score-1.262]
</p><p>14 With this approach work happens at the expected priority and another queue can preempt a lower priority queue. [sent-137, score-1.334]
</p><p>15 One thread is safer, but then we have priority and latency issues. [sent-150, score-0.907]
</p><p>16 Actor + Parallel State Machine ModelIf synchronous logic is used then an Actor can not process high priority messages when a low priority message is being processed. [sent-159, score-1.541]
</p><p>17 Next time it picks up a message it can look for the reply message and resume processing of the low priority message. [sent-163, score-1.121]
</p><p>18 In short, having multiple message queues for different priority messages combined with state machine driven message processing when required can potentially give, in many situations, low latency processing of high priority messages. [sent-165, score-2.096]
</p><p>19 Many applications can be implemented in a straight forward fashion in this model to achieve high throughput and low latency for high priority work. [sent-182, score-1.016]
</p><p>20 Multiple Application Thread Pool Model (M - N)In this model multiple applications are multiplexed over a common thread pool and a scheduling system on top of the thread scheduling system is imposed. [sent-200, score-1.029]

<p>Introduction: Hidden in every computer is a hardware backplane for moving signals around.
Hidden in every application are ways of moving messages around and giving code
CPU time to process them. Unhiding those capabilities and making them first
class facilities for the programmer to control is the idea behind
AppBackplane.This goes directly against the trend of hiding everything from
the programmer and doing it all automagically. Which is great, until it
doesn't work. Then it sucks. And the approach of giving the programmer all the
power also sucks, until it's tuned to work together and performance is
incredible even under increasing loads. Then it's great.These are two
different curves going in opposite directions. You need to decide for your
application which curve you need to be on.AppBackplane is an example framework

<p>Introduction: For solutions take a look at:7 Life Saving Scalability Defenses Against Load
Monster Attacks.This is a look at all the bad things that can happen to your
carefully crafted program as loads increase: all hell breaks lose. Sure, you
can scale out or scale up, but you can also choose to program better. Make
your system handle larger loads. This saves money because fewer boxes are
needed and it will make the entire application more reliable and have better
response times. And it can be quite satisfying as a programmer.Large Number Of
ObjectsWe usually get into scaling problems when the number of objects gets
larger. Clearly resource usage of all types is stressed as the number of
objects grow.Continuous Failures Makes An Infinite Event StreamDuring large
network failure scenarios there is never time for the system recover. We are
in a continual state of stress.Lots of High Priority WorkFor example,

<p>Introduction: High Performance Multithreaded Access to Amazon SimpleDBis a great follow up
to the idea inHow SimpleDB Differs from a RDBMSthat more programming is the
price paid for performance in SimpleDB. It shows how much work and
infrastructure is required to batter better performance out of
SimpleDB.Remember, in SimpleDB you get keys to records from queries so if you
want to get all the fields for records you need to make separate requests.
Since SimpleDB isn't exactly a speed daemon the obvious strategy is to
parallelize. Even if a job takes a 100 msecs you can get a lot done in a
little time if you can execute enough jobs in parallel.Parallelization is the
approach taken by Haakon@AWS in his Java code example of how to get the most
out of SimpleDB. You can find the code atIndexing and Querying Amazon S3
Metadata with Amazon SimpleDB. We'll also consider how a back-end service
architecture built on Erlang may be a better fit with cloud computing.breakTwo

<p>Introduction: In a recent thread on Hacker News discussing recent AWS price changes,seldo
mentioned they use AWS for business, they just never use EBS on AWS. A good
question was asked:How do you even do anything without using EBS?Amazon
certainly makes using EBS the easiest path. And EBS has a better reliability
record as of late, but it's still often recommended to not use EBS. This
avoids a single point of failure at the cost of a lot of complexity, though as
AWS uses EBS internally, not using EBS may not save you if you use other AWS
services like RDS or ELB.If you don't want to use EBS, it's hard to know where
to even start. A dilemma to which Kevin Nuckolls gives a great answer:Well,
you break your services out onto stateless and stateful machines. After that,
you make sure that each of your stateful services is resilient to individual
node failure. I prefer to believe that if you can't roll your entire
infrastructure over to new nodes monthly then you're unprepared for the
eventual outage of</p><p>2 0.96421087 <a title="1425-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-24-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_24th%2C_2014.html">1585 high scalability-2014-01-24-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 24th, 2014</a></p>

runsTripAdvisor's Technical Operations team, Luke and Victor interned on his
team this past summer. This post is introduced byAndy Gelfond, TripAdvisor's
head of engineering.It's been a little over a year since our last post about
theTripAdvisor architecture. It has been an exciting year. Our business and
team continues to grow, we are now an independent public company, and we have
continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown -
we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work
across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:56M visitors per
month350M+ pages requests a day120TB+ of warehouse data running on a large

<p>Introduction: There's not a lot  of talk about application architectures at the process
level. You have your threads, pools of threads, and you have your callback
models. That's about it. Languages/frameworks making a virtue out of simple
models, like Go and Erlang, do so at the price of control. It's difficult to
make a low latency well conditioned application when a power full tool, like
work scheduling, is taken out of the hands of the programmer.But that's not
all there is my friend. We'll dive into different ways an application can be
composed across threads of control.Your favorite language may not give you
access to all the capabilities we are going to talk about, but lately there
has been a sort of revival in considering performance important, especially
for controlling latency variance, so I think it's time to talk about these
kind of issues. When it was do everything in the thread of a web server thread
pool none of these issues really mattered. But now that developers are

<p>Introduction: Vaibhav PuranikinWeb serving in the cloud - our experiences with nginx and
instance sizesdescribes their experience trying to maximum traffic and minimum
their web serving costs on EC2. Initially they tested with two m1.small
instance types and then they the switched to two c1.mediums instance types.
The m1s are the standard instance types and the c1s are the high CPU instance
types. Obviously the mediums have greater capability, but the cost difference
was interesting:In the long term they will save money using the larger
instances and not autoscaling. With the small instances, traffic bursts caused
autoscaling to kick in. New instances were started in response to load. The
instances woud be up for a short period of time and then spin down again. This
constant churn costs a lot of money. Selecting the larger instance sizes,
which are capable of handling the load without autoscaling, turn out to save
money even though they are more expensive. Starting new instances also takes a
few min</p><p>6 0.95560837 <a title="1425-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-28-Strategy%3A_Solve_Only_80_Percent_of_the_Problem.html">689 high scalability-2009-08-28-Strategy: Solve Only 80 Percent of the Problem</a></p>

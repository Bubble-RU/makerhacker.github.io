</p><p>6 Ivan proposes a plausible double fault scenario where you lose a router and a link so that one datacenter is completely isolated from the Internet. [sent-15, score-0.851]
</p><p>7 In this scenario the datacenter interconnects (DCIs) are still running. [sent-17, score-0.493]

inter-cluster replication, with each cluster located in a single DC. Remote
replication will introduce some eventual consistency into the system, but each
cluster will continue to be strongly consistent.Ryan Barrett, Google App
Engine datastore lead, gave this talkTransactions Across Datacenters (and
Other Weekend Projects)at the Google I/O 2009 conference.While the talk
doesn't necessarily break new technical ground, Ryan does an excellent job
explaining and evaluating the different options you have when architecting a
system to work across multiple datacenters. This is calledmultihoming,
operating from multiple datacenters simultaneously.As multihoming is one of
the most challenging tasks in all computing, Ryan's clear and thoughtful style
comfortably leads you through the various options. On the trip you learn:The

multiple data centers. The recent downtime of even a high quality operation
like Amazon makes this need all the more clear. Typically only the big boys
can afford the complexity of operating in two or more data centers. Cloud
computing along with utility billing starts to change that equation, leveling
the playing field. Even smaller outfits will be in a position to manage risk
by spreading machines amongst EC2, 3tera, Slicehost, Mosso and other
providers.The question then becomes: given we aren't Angels, how do we walk
amongst the clouds? One fascinating answer is exquisitely explained by Dmitriy

<p>Introduction: One consequence of ITstandardization and commodificationhas been
Google'sdatacenter is the computerview of the world. In that view all compute
resources (memory, CPU, storage) are fungible. They are interchangeable and
location independent, individual computers lose identity and become just a
part of a service.Thwarting that nirvana has been the abysmal performance of
commodity datacenter networks which have caused the preference of
architectures that favor the collocation of state and behaviour on the same
box. MapReduce famouslyships code over to storage nodesfor just this
reason.Change the network and you change the fundamental assumption driving
collocation based software architectures. You are then free to store data
anywhere and move compute anywhere you wish. The datacenter becomes the
computer.On the host side with an x8 slot running atPCI-Express 3.0speeds able

<p>Introduction: Someone is killing the Internet. Since you probably use the Internet everyday
you might find this surprising. It almost sounds silly, and the reason is
technical, but our crack team of networking experts has examined the patient
and made the diagnosis. What did they find?Diagnostic team: the Packet Pushers
gang (Greg Ferro,Jan Zorz,Ivan Pepelnjak) in the podcast How We Are Killing
the Internet.Diagnosis: invasive tunnelation. (tubes anyone?)Prognosis: even
Dr. House might not be able to help.Cure: go back to what the Internet was;
kill the tunnels; route IPv4 and IPv6; have public addresses on everything;
disrupt the telcos.This is a classic story in a strange setting--the network--
but the themes are universal: centralization vs. decentralization (that's
where the telcos obviously come in), good vs. evil, order vs. disorder,
tyranny vs. freedom, change vs. stasis, simplicity vs. complexity. And it's
all being carried out on battlefield few get to see: the infrastructure of

<p>Introduction: You might think major Internet companies have a latency, availability, and
bandwidth advantage because they can afford expensive dedicated point-to-point
private line networks between their data centers. And you would be right. It's
a great advantage. Or it at least it was a great advantage. Cost is the great
equalizer and companies are now scrambling for ways to cut costs. Many of the
most recognizable Internet companies are moving to IP VPNs (Virtual Private
Networks) as a much cheaper alternative to private lines. This is a strategy
you can effectively use too.This trend has historical precedent in the data
center. In the same way leading edge companies moved early to virtualize their
data centers, leading edge companies are now virtualizing their networks using
IP VPNs to build inexpensive private networks over a shared public network. In
kindergarten we learned sharing was polite, it turns out sharing can also save
a lot of money in both the data center and on the network.The line</p><p>4 0.72901285 <a title="1392-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-20-It%27s_Networking._In_Space%21_Or_How_E.T._Will_Phone_Home..html">1651 high scalability-2014-05-20-It's Networking.

<p>Introduction: What will the version of the Internet that follows us to the stars look like?
Yes, people are really thinking seriously about this sort of thing.
Specifically the InterPlanetary Networking Special Interest Group(IPNSIG
).Ansible-likefaster-than-light communication it isn't. There's no magical
warp drive. Nor is a network of telepaths acting as a 'verse spanning
telegraph system.It's more mundane than that. And in many ways more
interesting as it's sort of like the old Internet on steroids, the one that
was based on on UUCP and dial-up connections, but over vastly longer distances
and with muchlonger delays:The Interplanetary Internet (based on IPN, also
called InterPlaNet) is a conceived computer network in space, consisting of a
set of network nodes which can communicate with each other.[1][2]
Communication would be greatly delayed by the great interplanetary distances,

<p>Introduction: Who hasn't cursed their network for being slow while waiting for that annoying
little hour glass of pain to release all its grains of sand? But what's really
going on? Is your network really slow? PacketPushers Show 45 - Arista - EOS
Network Software Architecture has a good explanation of what may be really at
fault (paraphrased):Network operators get calls from application guys saying
the network is slow, but the problem is usually dropped packets due to
congestion. It's not usually latency, it's usually packet loss. Packet loss
causes TCP to back off and retransmit, which causes applications to appear
slow.Packet loss can be caused by a flakey transceiver, but the problem is
usually network congestion. Somewhere on the network there's fan-in, a
bottleneck develops, queues build up to a certain point, and when a queue
overflows it drops packets. Often the first sign of this happening is
application slowness.Queues get deeper and deeper because the network is
getting more and more use</p><p>6 0.67282277 <a title="1392-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-12-Think_of_Latency_as_a_Pseudo-permanent_Network_Partition.html">879 high scalability-2010-08-12-Think of Latency as a Pseudo-permanent Network Partition</a></p>

slime mold is even cooler than originally thought, storing a record of where
it's been using slime: The authors conclude, the slime isn't just the mold's
calling card. Instead, it's a way of marking the environment so that the
organism can sense where it's been, and not expend effort on searches that
won't pay off. Although the situation isn't an exact parallel, the authors
make a comparison to the pheromone trails used by ants.  InAfter Life: The
Strange Science Of Decaythere's a truly incredible sequence of gorgeously shot

amazing feats of computation. Take a look at what simple one celled organisms

<p>Introduction: Ivan Pepelnjak, in his short and information packed REDUNDANT DATA CENTER
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY video, shows why networking as played at the highest
levels is something you want to leave to professionals, like alarge animal
country vetenariandelivering a stuck foal at 2AM on a dark and stormy night.
There are always a lot questions about the black art of building redundant
datacenter networks and there's a shortage of accessible explanations. What I
liked about Ivan's video is how effortlessly he explains the issues and
tradeoffs you can expect in designing your own solution, as well as giving
creative solutions to those problems. A lot of years of experience are boiled
down to a 17 minute video.Ivan begins by showing what a canonical fully
redundant datacenter would look like:It's like an ark where everything goes
two by two. You have two datacenters, each datacenter has redundant core
switches, redundant servers, redundant disk arrays, redundant links between
datacenters (for synchro</p><p>4 0.85453826 <a title="1392-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-22-How_would_you_build_the_next_Internet%3F_Loons%2C_Drones%2C_Copters%2C_Satellites%2C_or_Something_Else%3F.html">1584 high scalability-2014-01-22-How would you build the next Internet?

<p>Introduction: If you were going to design a next generation Internet at the physical layer
that routes around the current Internet, what would it look like? What should
it do? How should it work? Who should own it? How should it be paid for? How
would you access it?It has long been said the Internet routes around
obstacles. Snowden has revealed some major obstacles. The beauty of the
current current app and web system is the physical network doesn't matter. We
can just replace it with something else. Something that doesn't flow through
choke points like backhaul networks,under sea cables, andcell towers. What
might that something else look like?Google's Loon ProjectProject Loonwas so
named because the idea was thought to be loony. Maybe not.The idea is to float
high-altitude balloons 20 miles in the air to create an aerial wireless
network with up to 3G-like speeds. Signals travel through the balloon network
from balloon to balloon, then to a ground-based station connected to an

<p>Introduction: Update: How-To Minimize Load Time for Fast User Experiences. Shows how to
analyze the bottlenecks preventing websites and blogs from loading quickly and
how to resolve them.80-90% of the end-user response time is spent on the
frontend, so it makes sense to concentrate efforts there before heroically
rewriting the backend. Take a shower before buying a Porsche, if you know what
I mean. Steve Souders, author ofHigh Performance WebsitesandYslow, hasten more

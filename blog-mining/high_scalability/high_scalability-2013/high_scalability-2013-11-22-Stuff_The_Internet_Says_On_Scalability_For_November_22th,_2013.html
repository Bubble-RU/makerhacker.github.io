  @hui_kenneth : @randybias: “3 ways 2 be market leader - be 1st, be best, or be cheapest. #AWS was all 3. Now #googlecloud may be best & is the cheapest.” 
  @thijs : The nice thing about Paper is that we can point out to clients that it took 18 experienced designers and developers two years to build.

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear?

 How algorithms help determine that shape of our world. First we encode normative rules of an idealized world in algorithms. Second those algorithms help enforce those expectations by nudging humans in to acting accordingly. A fun example is the story of  Ed Bolian's Record-Breaking Drive . Ed raced from New York to L.A. at speeds of up to 158 mph, "breaking countless laws – and the previous record, by more than two hours." His approach is one that any nerd would love. He had three radar detectors, two laser jammers, two nav systems, a CB radio, a scanner, two iPhones and two iPads running applications like Waze, lookouts in the back seat scanning for cops, and someone scouting ahead. Awesome! For the moral of the story, they were going s</p><p>4 0.86041075 <a title="1552-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-23-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_23%2C_2013.html">1506 high scalability-2013-08-23-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 23, 2013</a></p>

 Quotable Quotes:                                              
 
  @chaliy : Today I learned that I do not understand how #azure scaling works, instance scale does not affect requests/sec I can load. 
  @Lariar : Note how crazy this is. An international launch would have been a huge deal. Now it's just another thing you do. 
  smacktoward : The problem with relying on donations is that people don't make donations. 
  @toddhoffious : Programming is a tool built by logical positivists to solve the problems of idealists and pragmatists. We have a fundamental mismatch here. 
  @etherealmind : Me: "Weird, my phone data isn't working" Them: "They turned the 3G off at the tower because it  interferes with the particle accelerator"

<p>Introduction: The Peregrine falcon is a bird of prey, famous for its  high speed diving   attacks , feeding primarily on much slower Hadoops. Wait, sorry, it is Kevin Burton of Spinn3r's new  Peregrine project -- a  new FAST modern map reduce framework optimized for iterative and pipelined map reduce jobs -- that feeds on Hadoops.
 
If you don't know Kevin, he does a lot of excellent technical work that he's kind enough to share it on  his blog . Only he hasn't been blogging much lately, he's been heads down working on Peregrine. Now that Peregrine has been released, here's a short email interview with Kevin on why you might want to take up  falconry , the ancient sport of MapReduce.
  What does Spinn3r do that Peregrine is important to you?  
Ideally it was designed to execute pagerank but many iterative applications that we deploy and WANT to deploy (k-means) would be horribly inefficient under Hadoop as it doesn't have any support for merging and joining IO between tasks.  It also doesn't support</p><p>3 0.89607644 <a title="1552-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-07-Paper%3A_Tempest%3A_Scalable_Time-Critical_Web_Services_Platform.html">1544 high scalability-2013-11-07-Paper: Tempest: Scalable Time-Critical Web Services Platform</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An interesting and different implementation approach:  Tempest: Scalable Time-Critical Web Services Platform : 
  

Tempest is a new framework for developing time-critical web services. Tempest enables developers to build scalable, fault-tolerant services that can then be automatically replicated and deployed across clusters of computing nodes. The platform automatically adapts to load ﬂuctuations, reacts when components fail, and ensures consistency between replicas by repairing when inconsistencies do occur. Tempest relies on a family of epidemic protocols and on Ricochet, a reliable time critical multicast protocol with probabilistic guarantees.


Tempest is built around a novel storage abstraction called the TempestCollection in which application developers store the state of a service. Our platform handles the replication of this state across clones of the service, persistence, and failure handling. To minimize the need for specialized knowledge on the part of the application deve</p><p>4 0.89489836 <a title="1552-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-24-4_New_Podcasts_for_Scalable_Summertime_Reading.html">864 high scalability-2010-07-24-4 New Podcasts for Scalable Summertime Reading</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's trendy today to say "I don't read blogs anymore, I just  let the  random chance of my social network guide me to new and interesting  content." #fail. While someone says this I imagine them flicking their  hair back in a "I can't be bothered with true understanding" disdain. And  where does random chance get its content? From people like these. So:  support your local blog! 
 
If you would like to be a part of random chance, here are a few new podcasts/blogs/vidcasts that you may not know about and that I've found interesting:

 Quotable Quotes:                           
 
  Jony Ive : I feel that ideas are very fragile, so you have to be tender when they are in development. I realized that if he pissed on this, it would be so sad because I know it was so important. 
  @BenedictEvans : 100m users is the new 1m users. $4bn is the new $400m. 30 staff is the new 300 staff. 
  @postwait : Knowing the latency of every I/O on every spindle in every machine in every rack... over all of time. Done & eye-opening. Thanks @circonus.

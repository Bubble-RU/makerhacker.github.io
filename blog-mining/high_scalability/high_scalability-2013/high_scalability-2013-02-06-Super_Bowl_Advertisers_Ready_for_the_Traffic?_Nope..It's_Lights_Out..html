<p>Introduction: We build web applications…and there are plenty of them around. Now, if we hit the jackpot and our application becomes very popular, traffic goes up, and our servers are brought down by the hordes of people coming to our website. What do we do in that situation?     Of course, I am not talking here about the kind of traffic Digg, Yahoo Buzz or other social media sites can bring to a website, which is temporary overnight traffic, or a website which uses cloud computing like Amazon EC2 service, MediaTemple Grid Service or Mosso Hosting Cloud service.     I am talking about traffic that consistently increases over time as the service achieves success. Google.com, Yahoo.com, Myspace.com, Facebook.com, Plentyoffish.com, Linkedin.com, Youtube.com and others are examples of services which have constant high traffic.     Knowing that users want speed from their applications, these services will always use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to deliver that speed.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Dave Hagler  Systems Architect at AOL. 
  The AOL homepages receive more than  8 million visitors per day .  That’s more daily viewers than Good Morning America or the Today Show on television.  Over a billion page views are served each month.  AOL.com has been a major internet destination since 1996, and still has a strong following of loyal users.
   The architecture for AOL.com is in it’s 5th generation .  It has essentially been rebuilt from scratch 5 times over two decades.  The current architecture was designed 6 years ago.  Pieces have been upgraded and new components have been added along the way, but the overall design remains largely intact.  The code, tools, development and deployment processes are highly tuned over 6 years of continual improvement, making the AOL.com architecture battle tested and very stable.
  The engineering team is made up of developers, testers, and operations and  totals around 25 people .  The majority are in Dulles, Virginia</p><p>4 0.13482724 <a title="1401-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-12-Creating_Scalable_Digital_Libraries.html">856 high scalability-2010-07-12-Creating Scalable Digital Libraries</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Like many other media content providers, libraries and museums are increasingly moving their content onto the Web.  While the move itself is no easy process (with digitization, web development, and training costs), being able to successfully deliver content to a wide audience is an ongoing concern, particularly for large libraries.
 
Much of the concern is financial, as most libraries do not have the internal budget or outside investors that for-profit businesses enjoy.  Even large university libraries will face serious budget constraints that even other university departments, such as science and technology would not face.
 
Creating a scalable infrastructure and also distributing a large digital collection that can handle multiple requests, requires planning that many librarians have not even imagined.  They must stop thinking in terms of "one-item-per-customer" and start thinking in terms of numerous users accessing the same information simultaneously.

<p>Introduction: Update:   How-To Minimize Load Time for Fast User Experiences .  Shows how to analyze the bottlenecks preventing websites and blogs from loading quickly and how to resolve them.  80-90% of the end-user response time is spent on the frontend, so it makes sense to concentrate efforts there before heroically rewriting the backend. Take a shower before buying a Porsche, if you know what I mean. Steve Souders, author of  High Performance Websites  and  Yslow , has  ten more best practices to speed up your website :
  Split the initial payload   Load scripts without blocking   Don’t scatter scripts   Split dominant content domains   Make static content cookie-free   Reduce cookie weight   Minify CSS   Optimize images   Use iframes sparingly   To www or not to www  Sadly, according to String Theory, there are only 26.7 rules left, so get them while they're still in our dimension.

<p>Introduction: In the article  The  Onion Uses Django, And Why It Matters To Us , a lot of interesting points are made about their ambitious infrastructure move from Drupal/PHP to Django/Python: the move wasn't that hard, it just took time and work because of their previous experience moving the A.V. Club website; churn in core framework APIs make it more attractive to move than stay; supporting the structure of older versions of the site is an unsolved problem; the built-in Django admin saved a lot of work; group development is easier with "fewer specialized or hacked together pieces"; they use IRC for distributed development; sphinx for full-text search; nginx is the media server and reverse proxy; haproxy made the launch process a 5  second procedure; capistrano for deployment; clean component separation makes moving easier; Git for version control; ORM with complicated querysets is a performance problem; memcached for caching rendered pages; the CDN checks for updates every 10 minutes; videos, ar</p><p>4 0.8104924 <a title="1401-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-30-Better_Browser_Caching_is_More_Important_than_No_Javascript_or_Fast_Networks_for_HTTP_Performance.html">1396 high scalability-2013-01-30-Better Browser Caching is More Important than No Javascript or Fast Networks for HTTP Performance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Performance guru  Steve Souders  gave his keynote presentation,  Cache is King!  ( slides ), at the HTML5DevCon, besides being an extremely clear explanation of how caching works on the Internet and how to optimize your use of HTTP to get the best performance, Steve ran experiments that found some surprising results on what gave the best web site performance improvements.
 
In his base line test, page loads took 7.65 seconds (median of three runs). What change--Fast Network, No Javascript, or Primed Cache--would make the biggest performance improvement? It was Primed Cache.
  
 Fast Network - Using a fast FIOS network the load time was 4.13 seconds. Steve was surprised how big a difference this made, given how much work must happen in the browser.  
 No JavaScript - 4.74 seconds after disabling JavaScript. Both reduces transfers and skips parsing by the browser. Steve thought the effect would have been larger.

<p>Introduction: If you have a lot of static content to store and you aren't looking forward to setting up and maintaining your own giganto SAN,  maybe you can push off a lot of the hard lifting to a CDN?     Jesse Robbins at O'Reilly Radar posts that you have a lot more options now because the number of   Content Distribution Networks have doubled since last year  . In fact, Dan Rayburn says there are now   28 CDN   providers in the market. Hopefully you can find reasonable pricing at one of them.      Other than easing your burden, why might a CDN work for you? Because it makes your site faster and customers like that. How can a CDN so dramatically improve your site's performance?           Steve Saunders, author of   High Performance Web Sites: Essential Knowledge for Front-End Engineers  , has using a CDN has one of his "Thirteen Simple Rules for Speeding Up Your Web Site."      About CDNs Steve says:     Remember that 80-90% of the end-user response time is spent downloading all the components in</p><p>6 0.76040655 <a title="1401-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-16-Serving_250M_quotes-day_at_CNBC.com_with_aiCache.html">573 high scalability-2009-04-16-Serving 250M quotes-day at CNBC.com with aiCache</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Advertising for the Super Bowl is bigger than the game for many viewers. So you gotta figure advertisers are ready for the traffic bursts generated by their expensive ads? Not exactly...
 
Yottaa  reports an amazing 13 advertiser websites crashed  during the Super Bowl. Coke was interactively au currant, asking viewers to vote for the ending of a commercial, but load times went to 62 seconds. SodaStream, Calvin Klein, Axe, Got Milk? The Walking Dead, many movie sites, and many car sites, all were flagged with delay of fame penalties.
 
Lots of time, money, and creative energy is spent lovingly perfecting every detail of these commercials. It won't be a surprise to any programmer that this can't usually be said of the follow through on the backend.
 
So what can you do? Yottaa has some good tips and Michael Hamrah has a wonderful post on dealing with the Super Bowl Burst Problem:

<p>Introduction: Harish Ganesan  CTO of  8KMiles  has a very helpful blog,  Cloud, Big Data and Mobile , where he shows a nice analytical bent which leads to a lot of practical advice and cost saving tips:       
  Use SQS Batch Requests  to reduce the number of requests hitting SQS which saves costs. Sending 10 messages in a single batch request which in the example save $30/month. 
  Use SQS Long Polling  to reduce extra polling requests, cutting down empty receives, which in the example saves ~$600 in empty receive leakage costs. 
  Choose the right search technology choice to save costs in AWS  by matching your activity pattern to the technology. For a small application with constant load or a heavily utilized search tier or seasonal loads Amazon Cloud Search looks like the cost efficient play.  
  Use Amazon CloudFront Price Class to minimize costs  by selecting the right Price Class for your audience to potentially reduce delivery costs by excluding Amazon CloudFront’s more expensive edge locatio</p><p>3 0.91941047 <a title="1401-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-06-Product%3A_Perdition_Mail_Retrieval_Proxy.html">80 high scalability-2007-09-06-Product: Perdition Mail Retrieval Proxy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Perdition  is a fully featured POP3 and IMAP4 proxy server. It is able to handle both SSL and non-SSL connections and redirect users to a real-server based on a database lookup. Perdition supports modular based database access. ODBC, MySQL, PostgreSQL, GDBM, POSIX Regular Expression and NIS modules ship with the distribution. The API for modules is open allowing arbitrary modules to be written to allow access to any data store.  Perdition has many uses. Including, creating large mail systems where an end-user's mailbox may be stored on one of several hosts, integrating different mail systems together, migrating between different email infrastructures, and bridging plain-text, SSL and TLS services. It can also be used as part of a firewall. The use of perditon to scale mail services beyond a single box is discussed in high capacity email.</p><p>4 0.91782618 <a title="1401-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-04-Wide_Fast_SATA%3A_the_Recipe_for_Hot_Performance.html">1511 high scalability-2013-09-04-Wide Fast SATA: the Recipe for Hot Performance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by   Brian  Bulkowski  , CTO and co-founder of   Aerospike  , a leading clustered NoSQL  database, has worked in the area of high performance commodity systems  since 1989.  
 
This blog post will tell you exactly how to build a multi-terabyte high throughput datacenter server. A fast, reliable multi-terrabyte data tier can be used for recent behavior (messages, tweets, plays, actions), or anywhere that today you use Redis or Memcache.
 
You need to know:
  
  Which SSDs work  
  Which chassis work  
  How to configure your RAID cards  
  
Intel’s SATA solutions – combined with a high capacity storage server like the Dell R720xd and a host bus adapter based on the LSI 2208, and a Flash optimized database like  Aerospike , enables high throughput and low latency.
 
In a wide configuration, with 12 to 20 drives per 2U server, individual servers can cost-effectively serve at high throughput with 16T at $2.50 per GB with the s3700, or $1.25 with the s3500.

<p>Introduction: Practically any software project nowadays could not survive without a database (DBMS) backend storing all the business data that is vital to you and/or your customers. When projects grow larger, the amount of data usually grows larger exponentially. So you start moving the DBMS to a separate server to gain more speed and capacity. Which is all good and healthy but you do not gain any extra safety for this business data. You might be backing up your database once a day so in case the database server crashes you don't lose EVERYTHING, but how much can you really afford to lose?Â 
 
Well clearly this depends on what kind of data you are storing. In our case the users of our solutions use our software products to do their everyday (all day) work. They have "everything" they need for their business stored in the database we are providing. So is 24 hours of data loss acceptable? No, not really. One hour? Maybe. But what we really want is a second database running with the EXACT same data.

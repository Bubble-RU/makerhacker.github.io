<p>Introduction: "Everything in war is simple, but theďťż simplest thing is difficult." -- Carl
von ClausewitzGames are proving grounds for software architecture. They
combine scale, high performance, challenging problems, a rabid user base, cost
sensitivity, and the need for profit. And when games have in-game currency,
like EVE Online has, there's money at play, so you can't just get away with a
c'est la vie attitude. Engineering must be applied. InPlanning for war: how
the EVE Online servers deal with a 3,000 person battle, we learn some
techniques EVE Online uses to handle large games:7 Sensible...Do nothing.Most
games are manageable or have spikes that quickly dissipate. Run it Hot.
There's nothing to throttle as servers run at 100%. Why waste money? Use all
your CPU.Shard it. Games are sharded by solar system and multiple solar
systems run on a node.Move it. Games are moved when a machine becomes
overloaded. Live Node Remap, where a live game is moved to a new node without
disconnecting users, is n</p><p>3 0.1243208 <a title="1397-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In the era of Web 2.0 traditional approaches to capacity planning are often
difficult to implement. Guerrilla Capacity Planning facilitates rapid
forecasting of capacity requirements based on the opportunistic use of
whatever performance data and tools are available.One unique Guerrilla tool is
Virtual Load Testing, based on Dr. Gunther's "Universal Law of Computational
Scaling", which provides a highly cost-effective method for assessing
application scalability. Neil Gunther, M.Sc., Ph.D. is an internationally
recognized computer system performance consultant who founded Performance
Dynamics Company in 1994.Some reasons why you should understand this law:1. A
lot of people use the term "scalability" without clearly defining it, let
alone defining it quantitatively. Computer system scalability must be
quantified. If you can't quantify it, you can't guarantee it. The universal
law of computational scaling provides that quantification.2. One the greatest
impediments to applying queueing</p><p>6 0.11570092 <a title="1397-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-26-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_26%2C_2013.html">1447 high scalability-2013-04-26-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 26, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Garry Tan, cofounder of Posterous, lists 12 lessons for scaling that apply to
more than just Rails.Use cloud storage for static files.Use HTTP Cache Control
to tell the browser what it can cache.Use Sphinx for text search.Use InnoDB
for more crash resistant and faster writes.Don't use textbook Rails
ActiveRecord objects. Use New Relic to find exactly what is slow in your
system.Use memcache later so you find your database bottlenecks now.Use
mongrel proctitle to find your slow queries. You are only as fast as your
slowest queries.Use asynchronous job queuing to do work in parallel.Use
monitoring so you'll know when your site went down and why.Learn by reading
the source code, fixing problems, and submitting them back to the
community.Use new plugins. Old plugins can't be trusted.Use new information.
Old information can't be trusted.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.90813053 <a title="1397-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-01-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_1%2C_2013.html">1397 high scalability-2013-02-01-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 1, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: TypePad is considered the largest paid blogging service in the world. After
experience problems because of their meteoric growth, they eventually
transitioned to an architecture patterned after their sister company,

PlatformMySQLMemcachedPerlMogileFSApacheLinuxThe StatsAs of 2005 TypePad sends
250mbps of traffic using multiple network pipes for 3TB of traffic a day. They
were growing by 10-20% each month. I was unable to find more recent
statistics.The ArchitectureOriginal Architecture:- Single server running
Linux, Apache, Postgres, Perl, mod_perl- Storage was NFS on a filer.A
Devastating Crash Caused a New Direction- A RAID controller failed and spewed
data across all RAID disks.- The database was corrupted and the backups were
corrupted.- Their redundant filers suffered from "split brain" syndrome.They

I worked at an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switch startup. Over a
delicious Christmas punch my grandma asked me what I did for a living that I
could afford such extravagantly inexpensive gifts. Always so subtle. I
explained I worked on an ATM switch. Mistake. She sniffed, said that's nice,
and asked me why the Automated Teller Machine ate her bank card that morning.
No matter how hard I tried I couldn't convince her I didn't work on bank ATMs.

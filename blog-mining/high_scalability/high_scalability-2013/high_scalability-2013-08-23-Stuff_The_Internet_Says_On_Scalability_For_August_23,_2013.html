<p>Introduction: Someone is killing the Internet. Since you probably use the Internet everyday
you might find this surprising. It almost sounds silly, and the reason is
technical, but our crack team of networking experts has examined the patient
and made the diagnosis. What did they find?Diagnostic team: the Packet Pushers
gang (Greg Ferro,Jan Zorz,Ivan Pepelnjak) in the podcast How We Are Killing
the Internet.Diagnosis: invasive tunnelation. (tubes anyone?)Prognosis: even
Dr. House might not be able to help.Cure: go back to what the Internet was;
kill the tunnels; route IPv4 and IPv6; have public addresses on everything;
disrupt the telcos.This is a classic story in a strange setting--the network--
but the themes are universal: centralization vs. decentralization (that's
where the telcos obviously come in), good vs. evil, order vs. disorder,
tyranny vs. freedom, change vs. stasis, simplicity vs. complexity. And it's
all being carried out on battlefield few get to see: the infrastructure of
Internet.Ou</p><p>3 0.11462615 <a title="1506-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: In update toPrismatic Architecture - Using Machine Learning on Social Networks
to Figure Out What You Should Read on the Web, Jason Wolfe, even in the face
of deadening fatigue from long nights spent getting their iPhone app out, has
gallantly agreed to talk a little more about Primatic's approach to Machine
Learning.Documents and users are two areas where Prismatic applies ML (machine
learning):ML on DocumentsGiven an HTML document: learn how to extract the main
text of the page (rather than the sidebar, footer, comments, etc), its title,
author, best images, etcdetermine features for relevance (e.g., what the
article is about, topics, etc.)The setup for most of these tasks is pretty
typical. Models are trained using big batch jobs on other machines that read
data from s3, save the learned parameter files to s3, and then read (and
periodically refresh) the models from s3 in the ingest pipeline.All of the
data that flows out of the system can be fed back into this pipeline, which

<p>Introduction: (Please bare with me, I'm a new, passionate, confident and terrified
programmer :D )Background:I'm pre-launch and 1 year into the development of my
application. My target is to be able to eventually handle millions of
registered users with 5-10% of them concurrent. Up to this point I've used
auto-increment to assign unique identifiers to rows. I am now considering
switching to a non-sequential strategy. Oh, I'm using the LAMP
configuration.My reasons for avoiding auto-increment:1. Complicates
replication when scaling horizontally. Risk of collision is significant (when
running multiple masters). Note: I've read the other entries in this forum
that relate to ID generation and there have been some great suggestions --
including a strategy that uses auto-increment in a way that avoids this
pitfall... That said, I'm still nervous about it.2. Potential bottleneck when
retrieving/assigning IDs -- IDs assigned at the database.My reasons for being
nervous about non-sequential IDs:1.

<p>Introduction: Scalability porn(SFW). Real time meter for the number of ads being served by
doubleclick. Amazing. A constant ~390,000 impressions a second are being
served and 25 trillion since 1996. Thanks to Mike Rhoads for title
idea.Scalability? Don't worry. Application complexity? Worryby Joe
McKendrick.The next challenge on enterprise agendas: application complexity.
This is something that lots of hardware -- whether from the cloud or internal
data center -- cannot fixLeo Laporte and Steve Gibson talked about how the
iPad was a denial of service attack on UPS delivery schedules. UPS trucks were
filled with iPads.Cassandra: Fact vs fiction. Jonathan Ellies puts the
beatdown on Cassandra misinformation. Don't you dare say Cassandra can't work
across datacenters!JIT'd code calling conventions. Cliff Click Jr shows how
Java's calling convention canmatch compiled C code in speed, but allows for
the flexibility of calling (code,slow) non-JIT'd code. Some assembly code

<p>Introduction: Disqus - Scaling the Worlds Largest Django App. Interesting overview of a
commenting system with 75 million comments and 250 million visitors. Lots of
good details on how they partition their database, testing, continuous
integration, feature switches, caching, delayed signals, and more.Things I
learnt tracking a billion events in 24 hours: Know your host, Scaling isn't
just servers, My servers need to talk to me more, Kill switches for users,
What you don't know is the problem, Don't mix server roles, Know your most
important users outside of your site.Tweets of Gold:georgebarnett: I read High
Scalability for useful articles about large scaling. Sadly though, nothing
useful ever shows up. #NoLongerBotheringnorthscale: wow that is fast! :) RT

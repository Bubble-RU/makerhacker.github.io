<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byIvan de PradoandPere Ferrera, founders ofDatasalt, the
company behindPangoolandSplout SQLBig Data open-source projects.The amount of
payments performed using credit cards is huge. It is clear that there is
inherent value in the data that can be derived from analyzing all the
transactions. Client fidelity, demographics, heat maps of activity, shop
recommendations, and many other statistics are useful to both clients and
shops for improving their relationship with the market. AtDatasaltwe have
developed a system in collaboration with theBBVA bankthat is able to analyze
years of data and serve insights and statistics to different low-latency web
and mobile applications.The main challenge we faced besides processing Big
Data input is thatthe output was also Big Data, and even bigger than the
input. And this output needed to be served quickly, under high load.The
solution we developed has an infrastructure cost of just a few thousands of
dollars per month thanks to th</p><p>4 0.89541042 <a title="1389-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-10-Paper%3A_Consensus_Protocols%3A_Paxos___.html">529 high scalability-2009-03-10-Paper: Consensus Protocols: Paxos   </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: Barbara Liskov's Turing Award, and Byzantine Fault Tolerance.Henry
Robinson has created an excellent series of articles on consensus protocols.
We already covered his2 Phase Commitarticle and he also has a3 Phase
Commitarticle showing how to handle 2PC under single node failures.But that is
not enough! 3PC works well under node failures, but fails for network
failures. So another consensus mechanism is needed that handles both network
and node failures. And that'sPaxos.Paxos correctly handles both types of
failures, but it does this by becoming inaccessible if too many components
fail. This is the "liveness" property of protocols. Paxos waits until the
faults are fixed. Read queries can be handled, but updates will be blocked
until the protocol thinks it can make forward progress.The liveness of Paxos
is primarily dependent on network stability. In a distributed heterogeneous
environment you are at risk of losing the ability to make updates. Users hate
that.breakSo when compani</p><p>5 0.89102936 <a title="1389-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-12-Caching_and_Processing_2TB_Mozilla_Crash_Reports_in_memory_with_Hazelcast.html">1020 high scalability-2011-04-12-Caching and Processing 2TB Mozilla Crash Reports in memory with Hazelcast</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mozilla processes TB's of Firefox crash reports daily using HBase, Hadoop,
Python and Thrift protocol. The project is calledSocorro, a system for
collecting, processing, and displaying crash reports from clients. Today the
Socorro application stores about 2.6 million crash reports per day. During
peak traffic, it receives about 2.5K crashes per minute. In this article we
are going to demonstrate a proof of concept showing how Mozilla could
integrate Hazelcast into Socorro and achieve caching and processing 2TB of
crash reports with 50 node Hazelcast cluster. The video for the demo is
availablehere. Currently, Socorro has pythonic collectors, processors, and
middleware that communicate with HBase via the Thrift protocol. One of the
biggest limitations of the current architecture is that it is very sensitive
to latency or outages on the HBase side. If the collectors cannot store an
item in HBase then they will store it on local disk and it will not be
accessible to the processors or midd</p><p>6 0.88955069 <a title="1389-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-04-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_4%2C_2011.html">984 high scalability-2011-02-04-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 4, 2011</a></p>

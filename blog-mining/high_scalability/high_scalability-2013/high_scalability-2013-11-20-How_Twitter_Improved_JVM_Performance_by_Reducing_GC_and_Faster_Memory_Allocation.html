<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Greg Luck Founder and CTO,EhcacheTerracotta Inc.Note:
this article contains a bit too much of a product pitch, but the points are
still generally valid and useful.The legendary Moore's Law, which states that
the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on an integrated
circuit doubles approximately every two years, has held true since 1965. It
follows that integrated circuits will continue to get smaller, with chip
fabrication currently at a minuscule 22nm process (1). Users of big iron
hardware, or servers that are dense in terms of CPU power and memory capacity,
benefit from this trend as their hardware becomes cheaper and more powerful
over time. At some point soon, however, density limits imposed by quantum

<p>Introduction: If Twitter is the "nervous system of the web" as some people think, then what
is the brain that makes sense of all those signals (tweets) from the nervous
system? That brain is the Twitter Analytics System and Kevin Weil, as
Analytics Lead at Twitter, is the homunculus within in charge of figuring out
what those over 100 billion tweets (approximately the number of neurons in the
human brain) mean.Twitter has only 10% of the expected 100 billion tweets now,
but a good brain always plans ahead. Kevin gave a talk,Hadoop and Protocol
Buffers at Twitter, at theHadoop Meetup, explaining how Twitter plans to use
all that data to an answer key business questions.What type of questions is
Twitter interested in answering? Questions that help them better understand
Twitter. Questions like:How many requests do we serve in a day?What is the
average latency?How many searches happen in day?How many unique queries, how
many unique users, what is their geographic distribution?What can we tell
about as</p><p>5 0.14861912 <a title="1551-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-03-Hazelcast_2.0%3A_Big_Data_In-Memory.html">1221 high scalability-2012-04-03-Hazelcast 2.0: Big Data In-Memory</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As it is said in the recent article"Google: Taming the Long Latency Tail -
When More Machines Equals Worse Results" , latency variability has greater
impact in larger scale clusters where a typical request is composed of
multiple distributed/parallel requests. The overall response time dramatically
decreases if latency of each request is not consistent and low. In dynamically
scalable partitioned storage systems, whether it is a NoSQL database,
filesystem or in-memory data grid, changes in the cluster (adding or removing
a node) can lead to big data moves in the network to re-balance the cluster.
Re-balancing will be needed for both primary and backup data on those nodes.
If a node crashes for example, dead node's data has to be re-owned (become
primary) by other node(s) and also its backup has to be taken immediately to
be fail-safe again. Shuffling MBs of data around has a negative effect in the
cluster as it consumes your valuable resources such as network, CPU and RAM.

<p>Introduction: Dropboxsaves one million files every 15 minutes,  more tweets than even
Twitterers tweet. That mind blowing statistic was revealed by Rian Hunter, a
Dropbox Engineer, in his presentation How Dropbox Did It and How Python Helped
at PyCon 2011.The first part of the presentation is some Dropbox lore, origin
stories and other foundational myths. We learn thatDropbox is a startup
company located in San Francisco that has probably one of the most popular
file synchronization and sharing tools in the world, shipping Python on the
desktop and supporting millions of users and growing every day. About half way
through the talk turns technical. Not a lot of info on how Dropbox handles
this massive scale was dropped, but there were a number of good lessons to
ponder:Use Python99.9 % of their code is in Python. Used on the server
backend; desktop client, website controller logic, API backend, and
analytics.Can't use Python on the Android due to memory constraints.Runs on a

Java VMs. It provides up to a terabyte of virtual heap for Java applications
that spans hundreds of connected JVMs.NAM is best suited for storing what they
call scratch data. Scratch data is defined as object oriented data that is
critical to the execution of a series of Java operations inside the JVM, but
may not be critical once a business transaction is complete.The Terracotta

<p>Introduction: Nettyis a high-performance NIO(New IO) client server framework for Java that
Twitter uses internally as a protocol agonostic RPC system. Twitterfound some
problemswith Netty 3's memory management for buffer allocations beacause it
generated a lot of garbage during operation. When you send as many messages as
Twitter it creates a lot of GC pressure and the simple act of zero filling
newly allocated buffers consumed 50% of memory bandwidth. Netty 4 fixes this
situation with:Short-lived event objects, methods on long-lived channel
objects are used to handle I/O events.Secialized buffer allocator that uses
pool which implementsbuddy memory allocationandslab allocation.The result:5
times less frequent GC pauses: 45.5 vs. 9.2 times/min5 times less garbage
production: 207.11 vs 41.81 MiB/sThe buffer pool is much faster than JVM as
the size of the buffer increases. Some problems with smaller buffers.Given how
many services use the JVM in their messaging infrastructure and how many

<p>Introduction: Data mining and fast queries are always in that bin of hard to do things where
doing something smarter can yield big results. Bloom Filters are one such do
it smarter strategy, compressed bitmap indexes are another. In one application
"FastBit outruns other search indexes by a factor of 10 to 100 and doesn't
require much more room than the original data size." The data size is an
interesting metric. Our old standard b-trees can be two to four times larger
than the original data. In a test searching an Enron email database FastBit
outran MySQL by 10 to 1,000 times.FastBit is a software tool for searching
large read-only datasets. It organizes user data in a column-oriented
structure which is efficient for on-line analytical processing (OLAP), and
utilizes compressed bitmap indices to further speed up query processing.
Analyses have proven the compressed bitmap index used in FastBit to be
theoretically optimal for one-dimensional queries. Compared with other optimal
indexing methods, bit</p><p>3 0.78260493 <a title="1551-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-06-11_Common_Web_Use_Cases_Solved_in_Redis.html">1074 high scalability-2011-07-06-11 Common Web Use Cases Solved in Redis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In How to take advantage of Redis just adding it to your stack Salvatore
'antirez' Sanfilippo shows how to solve some common problems in Redis by
taking advantage of its unique data structure handling capabilities. Common
Redis primitives like LPUSH, and LTRIM, and LREM are used to accomplish tasks
programmers need to get done, but that can be hard or slow in more traditional
stores. A very useful and practical article. How would you accomplish these
tasks in your framework?Show latest items listings in your home page. This is
a live in-memory cache and is very fast.LPUSHis used to insert a content ID at
the head of the list stored at a key.LTRIMis used to limit the number of items
in the list to 5000. If the user needs to page beyond this cache only then are
they sent to the database.Deletion and filtering. If a cached article is
deleted it can be removed from the cache using LREM.Leaderboards and related

<p>Introduction: InTaming The Long Latency Tailwe coveredLuiz Barroso's exploration of the long
tail latency (some operations are really slow) problems generated by large
fanout architectures (a request is composed of potentially thousands of other
requests). You may have noticed there weren't a lot of solutions. That's where
a talk I attended,Achieving Rapid Response Times in Large Online
Services(slide deck), byJeff Dean, also of Google, comes in:In this talk, I'll
describe a collection of techniques and practices lowering response times in
large distributed systems whose components run on shared clusters of machines,
where pieces of these systems are subject to interference by other tasks, and
where unpredictable latency hiccups are the norm, not the exception.The goal
is to use software techniques to reduce variability given the increasing
variability in underlying hardware, the need to handle dynamic workloads on a
shared infrastructure, and the need to use large fanout architectures to
operate at</p><p>6 0.7427671 <a title="1551-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-12-Google%3A_Taming_the_Long_Latency_Tail_-_When_More_Machines_Equals_Worse_Results.html">1207 high scalability-2012-03-12-Google: Taming the Long Latency Tail - When More Machines Equals Worse Results</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Now that we have theC10K concurrent connection problemlicked, how do we level
up and support 10 million concurrent connections? Impossible you say. Nope,
systems right now are delivering 10 million concurrent connections using
techniques that are as radical as they may be unfamiliar.To learn how it's
done we turn toRobert Graham, CEO of Errata Security, and his absolutely
fantastic talk atShmoocon 2013calledC10M Defending The Internet At
Scale.Robert has a brilliant way of framing the problem that I've never heard
of before. He starts with a little bit of history, relating how Unix wasn't
originally designed to be a general server OS, it was designed to be a control
system for a telephone network. It was the telephone network that actually
transported the data so there was a clean separation between the control plane
and the data plane. Theproblem is we now use Unix servers as part of the data
plane, which we shouldn't do at all. If we were designing a kernel for
handling one applicati</p><p>4 0.099124312 <a title="1462-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-19-Product%3A_Redis_-_Not_Just_Another_Key-Value_Store.html">545 high scalability-2009-03-19-Product: Redis - Not Just Another Key-Value Store</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With the introduction ofRedisyour options in the key-value space just grew and
your choice of which to pick just got a lot harder. But when you think about
it, that's not a bad position to be in at all.Redis (REmote DIctionary Server)
-a key-value database. It's similar to memcached but the dataset is not
volatile, and values can be strings, exactly like in memcached, but also lists
and sets with atomic operations to push/pop elements.The key points are: open
source; speed (benchmarked performing 110,000 SET operations, and 81,000 GETs,
per second); persistence, but in an asynchronous way taking everything in
memory; support for higher level data structures and atomic operations.The
home page is well organized so I'll spare the excessive-copying-to-make-this-
post-longer. For a good overview of Redis take a look at Antonio Cangiano's
article:Introducing Redis: a fast key-value database.If you are looking at a

just consistentData is read from disk once, then it's easily cachedAll
subsequent reads come straight from memoryRule of thumb: 250usec for 1MB of

<p>Introduction: An excellent article by Bryan Cantrill and Jeff Bonwick on how to write multi-
threaded code. With more processors and no magic bullet solution for how to
use them, knowing how to write multiprocessor code that doesn't screw up your
system is still a valuable skill. Some topics:Know your cold paths from your
hot paths.Intuition is frequently wrong--be data intensive.Know when--and when
not--to break up a lock.Be wary of readers/writer locks.Consider per-CPU
locking.Know when to broadcast--and when to signal.Learn to debug
postmortem.Design your systems to be composable.Don't use a semaphore where a
mutex would suffice.Consider memory retiring to implement per-chain hash-table
locks.Be aware of false sharing.Consider using nonblocking synchronization
routines to monitor contention.When reacquiring locks, consider using
generation counts to detect state change.Use wait- and lock-free structures
only if you absolutely must.Prepare for the thrill of victory--and the agony
of defeat.While I</p><p>3 0.74518168 <a title="1462-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-16-Big_List_of_20_Common_Bottlenecks.html">1246 high scalability-2012-05-16-Big List of 20 Common Bottlenecks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: InZen And The Art Of Scaling - A Koan And Epigram Approach,Russell
Sullivanoffered an interesting conjecture: there are 20 classic bottlenecks.
This sounds suspiciously like the idea that there only20 basic story plots.
And depending on how you chunkify things, it may be true, but in practice we
all know bottlenecks come in infinite flavors, all tasting of sour and ash.One
dayAurelien Broszniowskifrom Terracotta emailed me his list of bottlenecks, we
cc'ed Russell in on the conversation, he gave me his list, I have a list, and
here's the resulting stone soup.Russell said this is his "I wish I knew when I
was younger" list and I think that's an enriching way to look at it. The more
experience you have, the more different types of projects you tackle, the more
lessons you'll be able add to a list like this. So when you read this list,
and when you make your own, you are stepping through years of accumulated
experience and more than a little frustration, but in each there is a story

<p>Introduction: Hey, it's HighScalability time: The Herokulypse. A cautionary tale of what can
happen when scalability is left for later. Rap Genius created quite a stir
(reddit,Hacker News) when they documentedhigh costs ($20K/month for 15 million
monthly uniques) and poor performance (6 second average response times) using
Heroku'srandom routing mesh. The cause was tracked to queuing at the dyno
level when the expectation was requests are routed to free dynos. Heroku
admitsthis is a problem. So poor load balancing combined with RoR single
threading = poor performance, one that adding more dynos and spending more
money won't necessarily help. While it seems clear Heroku didn't make this
aspect of their system crystal clear, the incident has generated a lot of
teaching moments, if you slog through it all. This is a developing story.You

<p>Introduction: At the core of the new real-time web, which is really really old, are
continuous queries. I like how this paper proposed to handle dynamic demand
and dynamic resource availability by making the underlying system adaptable,
which seems like a very cloudy kind of thing to do.Abstract:The long-running
nature of continuous queries poses new scalability challenges for dataflow
processing. CQ systems execute pipelined dataflows that may be shared across
multiplequeries. The scalability of these dataflows is limited by their
constituent, stateful operators - e.g. windowed joins or grouping operators.
To scale such operators, a natural solution is to partition them across a
shared-nothing platform. But in the CQ context, traditional, static
techniquesfor partitioned parallelism can exhibit detrimental imbalances as
workload and runtime conditions evolve. Longrunning CQ dataflows must continue
to function robustly inthe face of these imbalances. To address this
challenge, we introduce a dataflo</p><p>same-blog 2 0.8297562 <a title="1462-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-22-Strategy%3A_Stop_Using_Linked-Lists.html">1462 high scalability-2013-05-22-Strategy: Stop Using Linked-Lists</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What data structure is more sacred than the link list? If we get rid of it
what silly interview questions would we use instead? But not using linked-
lists is exactly what Aater Suleman recommends inShould you ever use Linked-
Lists?InThe Secret To 10 Million Concurrent Connectionsone of the important
strategies is not scribbling data all over memory via pointers because
following pointers increases cache misses whichreduces performance. And
there's nothing more iconic of pointers than the link list.Here are Aeter's
reasons to be anti-linked-list:They reduce the benefit of out-of-order
execution.They throw off hardware prefetching.They reduce DRAM and TLB
locality.They cannot leverage SIMD.They are harder to send to GPUs.He also
demolishes the pros of linked-lists, finding arrays a better option in almost
every case. Good discussion in the comment section as not everyone
agrees.Patrick Wyatt detailshow a linked-list threading bugrepeatedly crashed

<p>Introduction: MySQL Scale-Out by application partitioningby Oli SennhauserEventually every
database system hit its limits. Especially on the Internet, where you have
millions of users which theoretically access your database simultaneously,
eventually your IO system will be a bottleneck. [A] promising but more complex
solution with nearly no scale-out limits is application partitioning. If and
when you get into the top-1000 rank on alexa [1], you have to think about such
solutions.A Quick Hit of What's InsideHorizontal application partitioning,

<p>Introduction: Jurriaan Persyn is a Lead Web Developer at Netlog, a social portal site that
gets 50 million unique visitors and 5+ billion page views per month. In this
paper Jurriaan goes into a lot of excellent nuts and bolts details about how
they used sharding to scale their system. If you are pondering sharding as a
solution to your scaling problems you'll want to read this paper. As the paper
is quite well organized there's no reason to write a summary, but I especially
liked this part from the conclusion:If you can do with simpler solutions
(better hardware, more hardware, server tweaking and tuning, vertical
partitioning, sql query optimization, ...) that require less development cost,
why invest lots of effort in sharding? On the other hand, when your visitor
statistics really start blowing through the roof, it is a good direction to
go. After all, it worked for us.</p><p>6 0.69580626 <a title="1462-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-15-Vedis_-_An_Embedded_Implementation_of_Redis_Supporting_Terabyte_Sized_Databases.html">1580 high scalability-2014-01-15-Vedis - An Embedded Implementation of Redis Supporting Terabyte Sized Databases</a></p>

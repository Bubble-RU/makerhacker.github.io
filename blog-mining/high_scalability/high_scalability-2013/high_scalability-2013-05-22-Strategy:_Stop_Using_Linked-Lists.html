<p>Introduction: Now that we have the    C10K concurrent connection problem    licked, how do we level up and support 10 million concurrent connections? Impossible you say. Nope, systems right now are delivering 10 million concurrent connections using techniques that are as radical as they may be unfamiliar. 
   To learn how it’s done we turn to    Robert Graham   , CEO of Errata Security, and his absolutely fantastic talk at    Shmoocon 2013    called    C10M Defending The Internet At Scale   . 
  Robert has a brilliant way of framing the problem that I’ve never heard of before. He starts with a little bit of history, relating how Unix wasn’t originally designed to be a general server OS, it was designed to be a control system for a telephone network. It was the telephone network that actually transported the data so there was a clean separation between the control plane and the data plane. The  problem is we now use Unix servers as part of the data plane , which we shouldn’t do at all. If we were des</p><p>4 0.099124312 <a title="1462-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-19-Product%3A_Redis_-_Not_Just_Another_Key-Value_Store.html">545 high scalability-2009-03-19-Product: Redis - Not Just Another Key-Value Store</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With the introduction of  Redis  your options in the key-value space just grew and your choice of which to pick just got a lot harder. But when you think about it, that's not a bad position to be in at all.  Redis (REmote DIctionary Server) -  a key-value database. It's similar to memcached but the dataset is not volatile, and values can be strings, exactly like in memcached, but also lists and sets with atomic operations to push/pop elements.   The key points are: open source; speed (benchmarked performing 110,000 SET operations, and 81,000 GETs, per second); persistence, but in an asynchronous way taking everything in memory; support for higher level data structures and atomic operations.  The home page is well organized so I'll spare the excessive-copying-to-make-this-post-longer. For a good overview of Redis take a look at Antonio Cangiano's article:  Introducing Redis: a fast key-value database .

<p>Introduction: Google AppEngine Numbers  
This group of numbers is from Brett Slatkin in  Building Scalable Web Apps with Google App Engine .
  Writes are expensive!   Datastore is transactional: writes require disk access   Disk access means disk seeks   Rule of thumb: 10ms for a disk seek   Simple math: 1s / 10ms = 100 seeks/sec maximum   Depends on: * The size and shape of your data * Doing work in batches (batch puts and gets) 
 Reads are cheap! 
   Reads do not need to be transactional, just consistent   Data is read from disk once, then it's easily cached   All subsequent reads come straight from memory   Rule of thumb: 250usec for 1MB of data from memory   Simple math: 1s / 250usec = 4GB/sec maximum * For a 1MB entity, that's 4000 fetches/sec 
 Numbers Miscellaneous

<p>Introduction: An excellent article by Bryan Cantrill and Jeff Bonwick on how to write multi-threaded code. With more processors and no magic bullet solution for how to use them, knowing how to write multiprocessor code that doesn't screw up your system is still a valuable skill. Some topics:
   Know your cold paths from your hot paths.    Intuition is frequently wrong—be data intensive.    Know when—and when not—to break up a lock.     Be wary of readers/writer locks.   Consider per-CPU locking.   Know when to broadcast—and when to signal.    Learn to debug postmortem.   Design your systems to be composable.    Don't use a semaphore where a mutex would suffice.   Consider memory retiring to implement per-chain hash-table locks.    Be aware of false sharing.   Consider using nonblocking synchronization routines to monitor contention.   When reacquiring locks, consider using generation counts to detect state change.   Use wait- and lock-free structures only if you absolutely must.

<p>Introduction: In   Zen And The Art Of Scaling - A Koan And Epigram Approach  ,   Russell Sullivan   offered an interesting conjecture: there are 20 classic bottlenecks. This sounds suspiciously like the idea that there only   20 basic story plots  . And depending on how you chunkify things, it may be true, but in practice we all know bottlenecks come in infinite flavors, all tasting of sour and ash.  One day  Aurelien Broszniowski  from Terracotta emailed me his list of bottlenecks, we cc’ed Russell in on the conversation, he gave me his list, I have a list, and here’s the resulting stone soup.   Russell said this is his “I wish I knew when I was younger" list and I think that’s an enriching way to look at it. The more experience you have, the more different types of projects you tackle, the more lessons you’ll be able add to a list like this. So when you read this list, and when you make your own, you are stepping through years of accumulated experience and more than a little frustration, but in ea</p><p>4 0.74155599 <a title="1462-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-15-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_15%2C_2013.html">1407 high scalability-2013-02-15-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 15, 2013</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hey, it's HighScalability time: 
  
 The Herokulypse. A cautionary tale of what can happen when scalability is left for later. Rap Genius created quite a stir ( reddit ,  Hacker News )  when they documented  high costs ($20K/month for 15 million monthly uniques) and poor performance (6 second average response times) using Heroku's  random routing mesh . The cause was tracked to queuing at the dyno level when the expectation was requests are routed to free dynos. Heroku admits  this is a problem . So poor load balancing combined with RoR single threading = poor performance, one that adding more dynos and spending more money won't necessarily help.

<p>Introduction: At the core of the new real-time web, which is really really old, are continuous queries. I like how this paper proposed to handle dynamic demand and dynamic resource availability by making the underlying system adaptable, which seems like a very cloudy kind of thing to do.  Abstract:
   The long-running nature of continuous queries poses new scalability challenges for dataflow processing. CQ systems execute pipelined dataflows that may be shared across multiple queries. The scalability of these dataflows is limited by their constituent, stateful operators â&euro;&ldquo; e.g. windowed joins or grouping operators. To scale such operators, a natural solution is to partition them across a shared-nothing platform. But in the CQ context, traditional, static techniques for partitioned parallelism can exhibit detrimental imbalances as workload and runtime conditions evolve. Longrunning CQ dataflows must continue to function robustly in the face of these imbalances. To address this challenge, we introduce</p><p>same-blog 2 0.8297562 <a title="1462-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-22-Strategy%3A_Stop_Using_Linked-Lists.html">1462 high scalability-2013-05-22-Strategy: Stop Using Linked-Lists</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What data structure is more sacred than the link list? If we get rid of it what silly interview questions would we use instead? But not using linked-lists is exactly what Aater Suleman recommends in  Should you ever use Linked-Lists?  
 
In  The Secret To 10 Million Concurrent Connections  one of the important strategies is not scribbling data all over memory via pointers because following pointers increases cache misses which  reduces performance . And there’s nothing more iconic of pointers than the link list.
 
Here are Aeter's reasons to be anti-linked-list:
  
 They reduce the benefit of out-of-order execution.  
 They throw off hardware prefetching.  
 They reduce DRAM and TLB locality.  
 They cannot leverage SIMD.  
 They are harder to send to GPUs.  
  
He also demolishes the pros of linked-lists, finding arrays a better option in almost every case. Good discussion in the comment section as not everyone agrees.

<p>Introduction: MySQL Scale-Out by application partitioning  by Oli Sennhauser
 
Eventually every database system hit its limits. Especially on the Internet, where you have millions of users which theoretically access your database simultaneously, eventually your IO system will be a bottleneck. [A] promising but more complex solution with nearly no scale-out limits is application partitioning. If and when you get into the top-1000 rank on alexa [1], you have to think about such solutions.

<p>Introduction: Jurriaan Persyn is a Lead Web Developer at Netlog, a social portal site that gets 50 million unique visitors and 5+ billion page views per month. In this paper Jurriaan goes into a lot of excellent nuts and bolts details about how they used sharding to scale their system. If you are pondering sharding as a solution to your scaling problems you'll want to read this paper. As the paper is quite well organized there's no reason to write a summary, but I especially liked this part from the conclusion:       If you can do with simpler solutions (better hardware, more hardware, server tweaking and tuning, vertical partitioning, sql query optimization, ...) that require less development cost, why invest lots of effort in sharding? On the other hand, when your visitor statistics really start blowing through the roof, it is a good direction to go. After all, it worked for us.</p><p>6 0.69580626 <a title="1462-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-15-Vedis_-_An_Embedded_Implementation_of_Redis_Supporting_Terabyte_Sized_Databases.html">1580 high scalability-2014-01-15-Vedis - An Embedded Implementation of Redis Supporting Terabyte Sized Databases</a></p>

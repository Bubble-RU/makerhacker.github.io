</p><p>2 Initially, provision your instance to the minimum size possible. [sent-25, score-0.156]
</p><p>3 6) Avoid noisy neighbors In any multi- tenant, non-dedicated, virtualized environment like AWS, you will certainly experience the noisy neighbor effect measured by CPU Steal. [sent-29, score-0.808]
</p><p>4 CPU Steal is the percentage of time that your virtualized guest is involuntarily waiting for physical host CPU from another guest. [sent-30, score-0.293]
</p><p>5 When using EBS-backed EC2 instances, you can flee a noisy environment by simply stopping and starting the instance. [sent-32, score-0.268]
</p><p>6 Of course, you'll need to make sure your healthcheck policies don't terminate the instance before it restarts. [sent-33, score-0.176]
</p><p>7 You can avoiding noisy neighbors by preferring larger EC2 instance types. [sent-35, score-0.518]
</p><p>8 Larger virtualized guest instances require more physical host resources - and therefore the host can support less overall tenants. [sent-36, score-0.483]
</p><p>9 micro's are extremely noisy and bursty - similar to my old college-dorm neighbors above. [sent-39, score-0.422]
</p><p>10 The most effective way to avoid noisy neighbors, however, is to pay extra for dedicated EC2 instances. [sent-40, score-0.382]
</p><p>11 Can't remember how much a dedicated instance costs? [sent-41, score-0.154]
</p><p>12 The newunified AWS CLIhas support for CloudFormation templates per a recentpostby AWS's Movember-friendly Evan Brown. [sent-49, score-0.158]
</p><p>13 If you're sensitive to cost, you can run the instance for 55 minutes, then terminate it. [sent-59, score-0.176]
</p><p>14 Another benefit is that VPC enable ELB's as a middletier load balancer behind a private subnet. [sent-65, score-0.133]
</p><p>15 It's worth noting that Network Address Translation (NAT) instances in a VPC are actually EC2 instances performing Port Address Translation (PAT) versus dedicated hardware devices with single-purposeASICchips. [sent-68, score-0.53]
</p><p>16 10) Pre-warm and autoscale-out your AWS resources before expected spikesELBs - along with other AWS blackbox resources such as NAT, S3, DynamoDB, Glacier, and Beanstalk - are made up of EC2 instances just like your custom application. [sent-69, score-0.186]
</p><p>17 These instances need to autoscale up and down just like your application - unless you provision them ahead of time. [sent-70, score-0.335]
</p><p>18 By default, Amazon will do their best to autoscale based on traffic, but it's always best to notify them for pre-warm and provisioning ahead of an expected spike. [sent-72, score-0.148]

team this past summer. This post is introduced byAndy Gelfond, TripAdvisor's
head of engineering.It's been a little over a year since our last post about
theTripAdvisor architecture. It has been an exciting year. Our business and
team continues to grow, we are now an independent public company, and we have
continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown -
we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work
across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:56M visitors per
month350M+ pages requests a day120TB+ of warehouse data running on a large

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byFrederic Faure(architect atYsance)on the differences
between using a cloud infrastructure and building your own. Frederic was kind
enough to translate the original French version of this article into
English.I've been noticing many questions about the differences inherent in
choosing between a Cloud infrastructure such asAWS(Amazon Web Services) and a
traditional physical infrastructure. Firstly, there are a certain number of
preconceived notions on this subject that I will attempt to decode for you.
Then, it must be understood that each infrastructure has its advantages and
disadvantages: a Cloud-type infrastructure does not necessarily fulfill your
requirements in every case, however, it can satisfy some of them by optimizing
or facilitating the features offered by a traditional physical infrastructure.
I will therefore demonstrate the differences between the two that I have
noticed, in order to help you make up your own mind.The FrameworkCloudThere
are several</p><p>4 0.19199409 <a title="1543-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-14-How_do_you_even_do_anything_without_using_EBS%3F.html">1631 high scalability-2014-04-14-How do you even do anything without using EBS?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a recent thread on Hacker News discussing recent AWS price changes,seldo
mentioned they use AWS for business, they just never use EBS on AWS. A good
question was asked:How do you even do anything without using EBS?Amazon
certainly makes using EBS the easiest path. And EBS has a better reliability
record as of late, but it's still often recommended to not use EBS. This
avoids a single point of failure at the cost of a lot of complexity, though as
AWS uses EBS internally, not using EBS may not save you if you use other AWS
services like RDS or ELB.If you don't want to use EBS, it's hard to know where
to even start. A dilemma to which Kevin Nuckolls gives a great answer:Well,
you break your services out onto stateless and stateful machines. After that,
you make sure that each of your stateful services is resilient to individual
node failure. I prefer to believe that if you can't roll your entire
infrastructure over to new nodes monthly then you're unprepared for the
eventual outage of</p><p>5 0.16705541 <a title="1543-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-16-Scaling_an_AWS_infrastructure_-_Tools_and_Patterns.html">881 high scalability-2010-08-16-Scaling an AWS infrastructure - Tools and Patterns</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.How do you scale anAWS(Amazon Web Services) infrastructure?
This article will give you a detailed reply in two parts: the tools you can
use to make the most of Amazon's dynamic approach, and the architectural model
you should adopt for a scalable infrastructure.I base my report on my
experience gained in several AWS production projects in casual gaming
(Facebook), e-commerce infrastructures and within the mainstream GIS
(Geographic Information System). It's true that my experience in gaming
(IsCool, The Game) is currently the most representative in terms of
scalability, due to the number of users (over 800 thousand DAU - daily active
users - at peak usage and over 20 million page views every day), however my
experiences in e-commerce and GIS (currently underway) provide a different
view of scalability, taking into account the various problems of availability
and data management.

<p>Introduction: Rodrigo Camposshared some interesting benchmark resultsfor AWS instances in
the South America Region (Sao Paulo) and US East Region (North Virginia). He
summarized the results in this thread on theGuerrilla Capacity
Planninglist:The same instance type shows a different behavior depending on
the region that it is running, this is particularly critical if you depend on
multiple regions for disaster recovery or geographical load balancingGenerally
speaking performance is better and more consistent in the South America region
when compared to Virginia, this is probably due to the fact that SA region was
the latest to be deployed. Maybe the SA datacenter uses new server models or
it is just underutilized, but this is a wild guessWrite performance for the
medium instance type in Virginia abruptly decays, dropping from almost 400
call/s to something around 300 calls/s, this is not very clear in the scatter
plot but if you draw a time-based chart you can clearly see this pattern. This

<p>Introduction: Are all instances created equal? Perhaps because under multi-tenancy multiple
virtual machines run on the same physical host, not all applications will run
equally well on every instance. In that case it makes sense to measure and
move to a better performing instance. That's the interesting idea
from@botchagalupe:Imagine something like a "performance monkey" where an
infrastructure is so bound that it can kill lower performing instances
automatically.@adriancosays Netflix has throught of doing the same: We've

<p>Introduction: Vaibhav PuranikinWeb serving in the cloud - our experiences with nginx and
instance sizesdescribes their experience trying to maximum traffic and minimum
their web serving costs on EC2. Initially they tested with two m1.small
instance types and then they the switched to two c1.mediums instance types.
The m1s are the standard instance types and the c1s are the high CPU instance
types. Obviously the mediums have greater capability, but the cost difference
was interesting:In the long term they will save money using the larger
instances and not autoscaling. With the small instances, traffic bursts caused
autoscaling to kick in. New instances were started in response to load. The
instances woud be up for a short period of time and then spin down again. This
constant churn costs a lot of money. Selecting the larger instance sizes,
which are capable of handling the load without autoscaling, turn out to save
money even though they are more expensive. Starting new instances also takes a

runsTripAdvisor's Technical Operations team, Luke and Victor interned on his
team this past summer. This post is introduced byAndy Gelfond, TripAdvisor's
head of engineering.It's been a little over a year since our last post about
theTripAdvisor architecture. It has been an exciting year. Our business and
team continues to grow, we are now an independent public company, and we have
continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown -
we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work
across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:56M visitors per
month350M+ pages requests a day120TB+ of warehouse data running on a large
Hadoop cluster, and quickly growingWe also had a very successful college
intern program that brought on over 60 interns this past summer, all who were
quickly on boarded and doing the same kind of work as our full time

<p>Introduction: Authored by Chris Fregly:  Former Netflix Streaming Platform Engineer, AWS
Certified Solution Architect and Purveyor of fluxcapacitor.com.Ahead of the
upcoming 2nd annual re:Invent conference, inspired by Simone Brunozzi's
recentpresentationat an AWS Meetup in San Francisco, and collected from a few
of my recentFluxcapacitor.com consulting engagements, I've compiled a list of
10 useful time and clock-tick saving tips about AWS.1) Query AWS resource
metadata Can't remember the EBS-Optimized IO throughput of your c1.xlarge
cluster?  How about the size limit of an S3 object on a single PUT?
awsnow.infois the answer to all of your AWS-resource metadata questions.
Interested in integrating awsnow.info with your application?  You're in luck.
There's now aREST API, as well!Note:  These are default soft limits and will
vary by account.2) Tame your S3 buckets Delete an entire S3 bucket with a
single CLI command:  aws s3 rb s3://\--forceRecursively copy a

<p>Introduction: The story of driving thegolden spiketo symbolize the completion of
thetranscontinental railroad is famous in the US. What is not so well known is
the story of how it also foreshadowed changes to come as an early version of
both the Internet and the Internet of Things. But that was 1869, how can that
possibly be?Telegraph as InternetFirst, let's establish the telegraph and
cable systems was an early version of an Internet.As railroad tracks were
being laid atranscontental telegraphsystem was also being constructed.
Telegraph lines were installed parallel to the tracks making instant
communication available across the continent, faster than any horse could
ride.With the transalantic cable system information could quickly span
continents in minutes:The miles of American telegraph grew from 40 in 1846 to
12,000 in 1850 to 23,000 in 1852. In Europe it increased from 2,000 in 1849 to
110,000 in 1869. The cost of sending 10 words was $1.55 in 1850, $1 in 1870,

<p>Introduction: Several readers had follow-up questions in response toHow FarmVille Scales to
Harvest 75 Million Players a Month. Here are Luke's response to those
questions (and a few of mine).How does social networking makes things easier
or harder?The primary interesting aspect of social networking games is how you
wind up with a graph of connected users who need to be access each other's
data on a frequent basis. This makes the overall dataset difficult if not
impossible to partition.What are examples of the Facebook calls you try to
avoid and how they impact game play?We can make a call for facebook friend
data to retrieve information about your friends playing the game. Normally, we
show a friend ladder at the bottom of the game that shows friend information,
including name and facebook photo. Can you say where your cache is, what form
it takes, and how much cached there is? Do you have a peering relationship
with Facebook, as one might expect at that bandwidth?We use memcache as our

Jonathan Marks: It's actually a talk about how NOT to be creative. And what he
[John Cleese] describes is the way most international broadcasters operated
for most of their existence. They were content factories, slave to an
artificial transmission schedule. Because they didn't take time to be
creative, then ended up sounding like a tape machine. They were run by a
computer algorithm. Not a human soul. There was never room for a creative
pause. Routine was the solution. And that's creativities biggest enemy.40%

found and the fix was using the right gcc flags. But the big hairy key idea

<p>Introduction: Aditya Agarwal, Director of Engineering at Facebook, gave an excellent  Scale at Facebook  talk that covers their architecture, but the talk is really more about how to scale an organization by preserving the best parts of its culture. The key take home of the talk is: 
  

You can get the code right, you can get the products right, but you need to get the culture right first. If you don't get the culture right then your company won't scale.

  
This leads into the four meta secrets of scaling at Facebook:
  
 Scaling takes Iteration 
 Don't Over Design 
 Choose the right tool for the job, but realize that your choice comes with overhead. 
 Get the culture right. Move Fast - break things. Huge Impact - small teams. Be bold - innovate. 
      Some Background    
  Facebook is big : 400 million active users; users spend an average of 20 minutes a day; 5 billion pieces of content (status updates, comments, likes, photo uploads, video uploads, chat messages, inbox messages, group events, f</p><p>3 0.13391954 <a title="1466-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-14-Google_Says_Cloud_Prices_Will_Follow_Moore%E2%80%99s_Law%3A_Are_We_All_Renters_Now%3F.html">1647 high scalability-2014-05-14-Google Says Cloud Prices Will Follow Moore’s Law: Are We All Renters Now?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After Google  cut prices  on their Google Cloud Platform Amazon quickly followed with their own  price cuts . Even more interesting is what the future holds for pricing. The near future looks great. After that? We'll see.
 
Adrian Cockcroft highlights that Google thinks  prices should follow  Moore’s law, which means we should expect prices to halve every 18-24 months.
 
That's good news. Greater cost certainty means you can make much more aggressive build out plans. With the savings you can hire more people, handle more customers, and add those media rich features you thought you couldn't afford. Design is directly related to costs.
 
Without Google competing with Amazon there's little doubt the price reduction curve would be much less favorable.
 
As a late cloud entrant Google is now in a customer acquisition phase, so they are willing to pay for customers, which means lower prices are an acceptable cost of doing business. Profit and high margins are not the objective.

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear? For years startups, like the frenetically inventive</p><p>5 0.11589377 <a title="1466-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Build_an_Infinitely_Scalable_Infrastructure_for_%24100_Using_Amazon_Services.html">38 high scalability-2007-07-30-Build an Infinitely Scalable Infrastructure for $100 Using Amazon Services</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Can you really create an infinitely scalable infrastructure for less than $100 using Amazon's storage, grid, and queuing services platform? It appears so, at least for the right application. Amazon beams a spot light on the future battle of the roll-your-own versus the connect-the-dots approach to building next generation websites using core external services. Their argument is strong. Using Amazon's platform you can quickly build an infrastructure that would otherwise take an eternity to make,  a pile of money to create, and an unbounded mass of people to implement and maintain. Yet Amazon doesn't provide SLAs, so you can you really trust them with your crown jewels? Facebook recently leap frogged Amazon's vision with an even more comprehensive set of services. The battle for the future is on.

Eight years is a difficult prediction horizon. It's too short to simply project out current trends and it's too long to discount potential technological breakthroughs coming to market. There's the challenge.
 
Some of my lousy predictions: 
  
  Programmers Will Form Guilds Around New Gamified Training Hubs  
  The Web Will Become More Closed Before it Becomes More Open  
  Not Everyone Will Become a Programmer  
  Focus Will Shift to Creating Bigger People Instead of Chasing Big Ideas

<p>Introduction: When two titans of the early computing industry, Apple co-founder  Steve Wozniak  and Atari founder  Nolan Bushnell , had a chance to sit down for a chat at the  C2SV  conference last Friday, we learned how a little foresight and luck can decide futures.  
  Steve Wozniak's Success - Expandability       
 
 
Steve talked about how the Apple II was the primary source of revenue for Apple's first 10 years of life. The reason the Apple II could last so long was that it was expandable. It had  eight expansion slots  and the RAM was also expandable (starting at 4K). No computer at the time had this kind of flexibility or  expansion capabilities . Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs argued over keeping the Apple II open. Jobs wanted closed, Wozniak wanted open and fortunately Wozniak won.  In fact, the Apple II was completely open (those were the days). They published the complete specs before there was anything like a developer community. 
 
So even though the Apple III, Lisa, and the Macintosh al</p><p>4 0.702277 <a title="1466-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-20-Smart_Companies_Fail_Because_they_Do_Everything_Right_-_Staying_Alive_to_Scale.html">1410 high scalability-2013-02-20-Smart Companies Fail Because they Do Everything Right - Staying Alive to Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wired has a  wonderful interview  with  Clayton Christensen , author of the tech ninja's bible,  Innovator's Dilemma . Innovation is the name of the game in Silicon Valley and if you want to understand the rules of the game this article is a quick and clear way of learning. Everything is simply explained with compelling examples by the man himself.
 
Just as every empire has fallen, every organization is open to disruption. It's the human condition to become comfortable and discount potential dangers. It takes a great deal of mindfulness to outwit and outlast the human condition. If you want to be the disruptor and avoid being the disruptee, this is good stuff.
 
He also talks about his new book,  The Capitalist's Dilemma , which addresses this puzzle: if corporations are doing so well why are individuals doing so bad?

<p>Introduction: After Google  cut prices  on their Google Cloud Platform Amazon quickly followed with their own  price cuts . Even more interesting is what the future holds for pricing. The near future looks great. After that? We'll see.
 
Adrian Cockcroft highlights that Google thinks  prices should follow  Moore’s law, which means we should expect prices to halve every 18-24 months.
 
That's good news. Greater cost certainty means you can make much more aggressive build out plans. With the savings you can hire more people, handle more customers, and add those media rich features you thought you couldn't afford. Design is directly related to costs.
 
Without Google competing with Amazon there's little doubt the price reduction curve would be much less favorable.
 
As a late cloud entrant Google is now in a customer acquisition phase, so they are willing to pay for customers, which means lower prices are an acceptable cost of doing business. Profit and high margins are not the objective.

America as the New World has a long history of inspiring  Utopian communities . Early experiments were famously religious. But there have been many others as new waves of thought have inspired people to organize and try something different.
 
In the 1840s Transcendentalists, believing the true path lay in the perfection of the individual, created intentional communities like  Brook Farm . We've also seen  socialist ,  anarchist ,  hippy , and virtually every other kind of Utopia in-between. Psychologist B.F. Skinner wrote an infamous book,  Walden Two , with a more "scientific" take on creating a Utopian community and Ayn Rand in  Atlas Shrugged  had her free market version.
 
I believe in startup organizations we see the modern version of Utopian energy in action. We now call it by names like "culture hacking", but the goal is the same: to create a new form of human community to achieve a profound go</p><p>4 0.85868156 <a title="1466-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-05-Paper%3A_Scalability_Design_Patterns.html">402 high scalability-2008-10-05-Paper: Scalability Design Patterns</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have introduced pattern languages in my earlier post on  The Pattern Bible for Distributed Computing .  Achieving highest possible scalability is a complex combination of many factors. This PLoP 2007  paper  presents a pattern language that can be used to make a system highly scalable.  The Scalability Pattern Language introduced by Kanwardeep Singh Ahluwalia includes patterns to:
  
 Introduce Scalability 
 
 Optimize Algorithm 
 
 Add Hardware 
 
 Add Parallelism 
 
 Add Intra-Process Parallelism 
 Add Inter-Porcess Parallelism 
 Add Hybrid Parallelism 
 
 
 
 Optimize Decentralization 
 
 Control Shared Resources

 Scale the web by appointing a Crawler Czar? Tom Foremski has the idea that  Google should open up their index  so sites wouldn't have to endure the constant pounding by ravenous crawler bots. Don MacAskill of SmugMug estimates  50% of our web server CPU resources  are spent serving crawlers. What a waste. How this would all work with real-time feeds, paid  feeds (Twitter, movies, ...), etc. is unknown, but does it make sense for all that money to be spent on extracting the same data over and over again?

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear?

     Amazing microscope image of a carnivorous bladderwort    
  How many drones would it take to replace Santa?  With a fleet of some 80 million or so F-16 drones the entire worldwide delivery could be completed in just over eight hours. Impressive, but a world without Rudolf is not a world I wish to contemplate.

 Quotable Quotes:                        
 
  @hackofalltrades : When positive change is only viewed through its scalability, bad things happen. 
  @faizanj : Is it time for #Netflix to move to a hybrid cloud architecture similar to Zynga zCloud? 
  @adrianco : we try not to invest in undifferentiated heavy lifting 
  @qui_oui : "scalability": a word that makes me think of how likely you are to have the ability to grow scales. 
  @Ninad_M : The question is, is #antifragile conceptually opposite of #bigdata 
  @pbailis : Batch your disk/network IO, kernel interrupts, customer package shipments -> delay arrival but increase efficiency

  @jimplush : Google spent 2.3 billion on infrastructure in Q1. Remember that when you say you want to be "the Google of something" 
 Clay Shirky: I think one of the things that happened to the P2P market for infrastructure is that users preference for predictable pricing vs resource-sensitive pricing is so overwhelming that they will overpay to anyone who can promise flat prices. And because the logic of centralization vs decentralization is so price sensitive, I don't think there is any logical reason to assume a broadly stable class of apps, separate from c</p><p>6 0.86124206 <a title="1516-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-14-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_14th%2C_2014.html">1596 high scalability-2014-02-14-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 14th, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Matt Abrams (@abramsm), from Clearspring, discussing how they are able to accurately estimate the cardinality of sets with billions of distinct elements using surprisingly small data structures. Their servers receive well over 100 billion events per month.  
 
At  Clearspring  we like to count things. Counting the number of distinct elements (the cardinality) of a set is challenge when the cardinality of the set     is large.
 
To better understand the challenge of determining the cardinality of large sets let's imagine that you have a 16 character ID and you'd like to count the number of distinct IDs that you've     seen in your logs. Here is an example:
 
4f67bfc603106cb2
 
 These 16 characters represent 128 bits. 65K IDs would require 1   megabyte of space. We receive over 3 billion events per day, and each   event has an ID. Those IDs require 384,000,000,000 bits or 45   gigabytes of storage.  And that is just the space that the ID field requires!

<p>Introduction: Inspired by a  xkcd comic ,  Peter Norvig ,  Director of Research at Google and all around interesting and nice guy, has created an above par code kata involving a regex program that demonstrates the core inner loop of many successful systems profiled on HighScalability.  
 
 The original code is at  xkcd 1313: Regex Golf , which comes up with an algorithm to find a short regex that matches the winners and not the losers from two arbitrary lists. The Python code is readable, the process is TDDish, and the problem, which sounds simple, but soon explodes into regex weirdness, as does most regex code. If you find regular expressions confusing you'll definitely benefit from Peter's deliberate strategy for finding a regex.  
 
 The post demonstrating the iterated improvement of the program is at  xkcd 1313: Regex Golf (Part 2: Infinite Problems) . As with most first solutions it wasn't optimal. To improve the program Peter recommends the following steps:

<p>Introduction: Hi,     In java web servers, each http request is handled by a thread in thread pool. So for a Servlet handling the request, a thread is assigned. It is tempting (and very convinient) to keep context information in the threadlocal variable. I recently had a requirement where we need to assign logged in user id and timestamp to request sent to web services. Because we already had the code in place, it was extremely difficult to change the method signatures to pass user id everywhere. The solution I thought is   class ReferenceIdGenerator {   public static setReferenceId(String login) {      threadLocal.set(login + System.currentMillis());   }     public static String getReferenceId() {     return threadLocal.get();   }   private static ThreadLocal threadLocal =       new ThreadLocal();       }     class MySevlet {     void service(.....) {       HttpSession session = request.getSession(false);      String userId = session.get("userId");          ReferenceIdGenerator.setRefernceId(userId</p><p>4 0.95314884 <a title="1516-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-16-Paper%3A_A_Provably_Correct_Scalable_Concurrent_Skip_List.html">1305 high scalability-2012-08-16-Paper: A Provably Correct Scalable Concurrent Skip List</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  MemSQL Architecture  we learned one of the core strategies MemSQL uses to achieve their need for speed is lock-free skip lists. Skip lists are used to efficiently handle range queries. Making the skip-lists lock-free helps eliminate contention and make writes fast. 
 
If this all sounds a little pie-in-the-sky then here's a very good paper on the subject that might help make it clearer:  A Provably Correct Scalable Concurrent Skip List .
 
From the abstract:
  We propose a new concurrent skip list algorithm distinguished by a combination of simplicity and scalability. The algorithm employs optimistic synchronization, searching without acquiring locks, followed by short lock-based validation before adding or removing nodes. It also logically removes an item before physically unlinking it. Unlike some other concurrent skip list algorithms, this algorithm preserves the skiplist properties at all times, which facilitates reasoning about its correctness. Experimental evidence shows that</p><p>5 0.94968474 <a title="1516-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-16-The_NewSQL_Market_Breakdown.html">1025 high scalability-2011-04-16-The NewSQL Market Breakdown</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matt Aslett from the 451 group created a term called  “NewSQL ”. On the definition of NewSQL, Aslett writes:
  

“NewSQL” is our shorthand for the various new scalable/high performance SQL database vendors. We have previously referred to these products as ‘ScalableSQL’ to differentiate them from the incumbent relational database products. Since this implies horizontal scalability, which is not necessarily a feature of all the products, we adopted the term ‘NewSQL’ in the new report.


And to clarify, like NoSQL, NewSQL is not to be taken too literally: the new thing about the NewSQL vendors is the vendor, not the SQL.

  
As with NoSQL, under the NewSQL umbrella you can see various providers, with various solutions.
 
I think these can be divided into several sub-types:

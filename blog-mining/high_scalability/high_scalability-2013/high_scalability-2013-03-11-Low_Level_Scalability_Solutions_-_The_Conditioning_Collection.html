</p><p>4 This failed approach allocates more memory, fills up queues, causes drops,  causes retransmits, uses more CPU, causes the network layer go crazy, causes nearly impossible to find deadlock bugs to decloak, and generally uses more resources, which makes a bad problem worse.

<p>Introduction: What good are problems without solutions? In 42 Monster Problems That Attack
As Loads Increase we talked about problems. In this first post (OK, there was
an earlier post, but I'm doing some reorganizing), we'll cover what I
callaggregation strategies.Keep in mind these are low level architecture type
suggestions of how to structure the components of your code and how they
interact. We're not talking about massive scale-out clusters here, but of what
your applications might like like internally, way below the service level
interface level. There's a lot more to the world than evented
architectures.Aggregation simply means we aren't using stupid queues. Our
queues will be smart. We are deeply aware of queues as containers of work that
eventually dictate how the entire system performs. As work containers we know
intimately what requests and data sit in our queues and we can use that
intelligence to our great advantage.Prioritize WorkThe key idea to it all is

<p>Introduction: Hidden in every computer is a hardware backplane for moving signals around.
Hidden in every application are ways of moving messages around and giving code
CPU time to process them. Unhiding those capabilities and making them first
class facilities for the programmer to control is the idea behind
AppBackplane.This goes directly against the trend of hiding everything from
the programmer and doing it all automagically. Which is great, until it
doesn't work. Then it sucks. And the approach of giving the programmer all the
power also sucks, until it's tuned to work together and performance is
incredible even under increasing loads. Then it's great.These are two
different curves going in opposite directions. You need to decide for your
application which curve you need to be on.AppBackplane is an example framework
supporting the multiple application architectures we talked about inBeyond

<p>Introduction: Ever wonder what powers Google's world spirit sensing Zeitgeist service? No,
it's not a homunculus ofGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel sitting in each browser.
It's actually a stream processing (think streaming MapReduce on steroids)
system called MillWheel, described in this very well written paper: MillWheel:
Fault-Tolerant Stream Processing at Internet Scale. MillWheel isn't just used
for Zeitgeist at Google, it's also used for streaming joins for a variety of
Ads customers, generalized anomaly-detection service, and network switch and
cluster health monitoring.Abstract:MillWheel is a framework for building low-
latency data-processing applications that is widely used at Google. Users
specify a directed computation graph and application code for individual
nodes, and the system manages persistent state and the continuous ďŹ&sbquo;ow of
records, all within the envelope of the framework's fault-tolerance
guarantees. This paper describes MillWheel's programming model as well as its
implementation.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.96234256 <a title="1421-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-11-Low_Level_Scalability_Solutions_-_The_Conditioning_Collection.html">1421 high scalability-2013-03-11-Low Level Scalability Solutions - The Conditioning Collection</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We talked about 42 Monster Problems That Attack As Loads Increase. And inThe
Aggregation Collection we talked about the value of prioritizing work and
making smart queues as a way of absorbing and not reflecting traffic
spikes.Now we move on to our next batch of strategies where the theme
isconditioning, which is the idea of shaping and controlling flows of work
within your application...Use Resources Proportional To a Fixed LimitThis is
probably the most important rule for achieving scalability within an
application. What it means:Find the resource that has a fixed limit that you
know you can support. For example, a guarantee to handle a certain number of
objects in memory. So if we always use resources proportional to the number of
objects it is likely we can prevent resource exhaustion.Devise ways of tying
what you need to do to the individual resources.Some examples:Keep a list of
purchase orders with line items over $20 (or whatever). Do not keep a list of
the line items because t</p><p>4 0.95849186 <a title="1421-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-21-Machine_VM_%2B_Cloud_API_-_Rewriting_the_Cloud_from_Scratch.html">923 high scalability-2010-10-21-Machine VM + Cloud API - Rewriting the Cloud from Scratch</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Write a little "Hello World" program these days and it runs inside a
bewildering Russian Doll of nested environments, each layer adding its own
special performance and complexity tax. First, a language executes in its own
environment of data structure libraries, memory management, and so on. That,
more often than not, will run inside a language VM like the JVM, CLR, or V8.
The language VM will in-turn run inside a process that runs inside an OS. An
application will run in one or more threads inside a process. And the whole
thing will run inside a machine sharing VM layer like Xen. And across all of
that are frameworks for monitoring, elasticity, storage, and so on. That's a
lot of overhead for a such a little program.What if we could remove all these
taxes and run directly on the new bare metal, which some consider to be a
combination of Machine VM + Cloud API? That's exactly what a system
calledMirage, described in the paperTurning down the LAMP: Software

coexist. #FOL2012@adrianco: Compared to vanilla EBS many times better for

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Jon Vlachogiannis . Jon is the founder and CTO of  BugSense . 
 
 BugSense, is an error-reporting and quality metrics service that tracks thousand of apps every day. When mobile apps crash, BugSense helps developers pinpoint and fix the problem. The startup delivers first-class service to its customers, which include VMWare, Samsung, Skype and thousands of independent app developers. Tracking more than 200M devices requires fast, fault tolerant and cheap infrastructure.    The last six months, we’ve decided to use our BigData infrastructure, to provide the users with metrics about their apps performance and stability and let them know how the errors affect their user base and revenues.    We knew that our solution should be scalable from day one, because more than 4% of the smartphones out there, will start DDOSing us with data.    We wanted to be able to:

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Ali Khajeh-Hosseini , Technical Lead at PlanForCloud.com.   
 
 I read a recent blog post about   TripAdvisor's experiment with AWS   where they attempted to process 700K HTTP requests per minute on a replica of their live site. There was also an interesting blog post on   Pinterest's massive growth on AWS  . These blogs highlighted exactly the types of questions we're interested in, mainly: 
    
  How much would it cost to deploy System X on Cloud Y?   e.g. how much would it cost to host TripAdvisor on the AWS US-East cloud?  
  Would it be cheaper to use deployment option X or Y?   e.g. would it be cheaper to use reserved instances, different types of instances, different cloud providers...  
  What happens to costs when the system grows?   e.g. Pinterest has around 410TB of data on S3, what if that keeps growing at a rate of 25% every month, like it has been in the last 10 months?

<p>Introduction: Mobile developers have a huge scaling problem ahead: doing something useful with massive continuous streams of telemetry data from millions and millions of devices. This is a really good problem to have. It means smartphone sales are finally fulfilling their destiny:  slaughtering PCs  in the sales arena. And it also means mobile devices aren't just containers for simple standalone apps anymore, they are becoming the dominant interface to giant backend systems.
    
While developers are now rocking mobile development on the client side, their next challenge is how to code those tricky backend bits. A company facing those same exact problems right now is  Medialets , a mobile rich media ad platform. What they do is help publishers create high quality interactive ads, though for our purposes their ad stuff isn't that interesting. What I did find really interesting about their system is how they are tackling the problem of defeating the mobile device data deluge.

<p>Introduction: Update 2: Summize  Computes Computing Resources for a Startup . Lots of nice graphs showing Amazon is hard to beat for small machines and become less cost efficient for well used larger machines.  Long term storage costs may eat your saving away. And out of cloud bandwidth costs are high.     Update: via  ProductionScale , a nice Digital Web article on  how to setup S3 to store media files  and how Blue Origin was able to handle 3.5 million requests and 758 GBs in bandwidth in a single day for very little $$$. Also a Right Scale article on  Network performance within Amazon EC2 and to Amazon S3 . 75MB/s between EC2 instances, 10.2MB/s between EC2 and S3 for download, 6.9MB/s upload.       Now that Amazon's S3 (storage service) is   out of beta   and EC2 (elastic compute cloud) has added new   instance types   (the class of machine you can rent) with more CPU and more RAM, I thought it would be interesting to take a look out how their pricing stacks up.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Yelp's     Jim  Blomo    . Jim manages a growing data mining team that uses  Hadoop ,  mrjob , and  oddjob  to process  TBs  of data. Before Yelp, he built infrastructure for startups and Amazon.    Check out his upcoming talk at    OSCON  2013 on Building a Cloud Culture at Yelp  . 
 
In Q1 2013, Yelp had  102 million unique visitors   (source: Google Analytics) including approximately 10 million unique mobile devices using the Yelp app on a monthly average basis.  Yelpers  ha ve  written more than   39 million rich, local reviews , making Yelp the leading local guide on everything from boutiques and mechanics to restaurants and dentists. With respect to data, one of the most unique things about Yelp is the variety of data: reviews, user profiles, business descriptions, menus, check-ins, food photos... the list goes on.  We have many ways to deal data, but today I’ll focus on how we handle offline data processing and analytics.

<p>Introduction: Making the world's knowledge computable  
  Today's Wolfram|Alpha is the first step in an ambitious, long-term project to make all systematic knowledge immediately computable by anyone.  You enter your question or calculation, and Wolfram|Alpha uses its built-in algorithms and growing collection of data to compute the answer. 
  Answer Engine vs Search Engine  
 When  Wolfram|Alpha  launches later today, it will be  one of the most computationally intensive websites on the internet . The  Wolfram|Alpha computational knowledge engine  is an "answer engine" that is able to produce answers to various questions such as

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Ivan de Prado  and  Pere Ferrera , founders of  Datasalt , the company behind  Pangool  and  Splout SQL  Big Data open-source projects.  
 
The amount of payments performed using credit cards is huge. It is clear that there is inherent value in the data that can be derived from analyzing all the transactions. Client fidelity, demographics, heat maps of activity, shop recommendations, and many other statistics are useful to both clients and shops for improving their relationship with the market. At  Datasalt  we have developed a system in collaboration with the  BBVA bank  that is able to analyze years of data and serve insights and statistics to different low-latency web and mobile applications.
 
The main challenge we faced besides processing Big Data input is that  the output was also Big Data, and even bigger than the input . And this output needed to be served quickly, under high load.
 
The solution we developed has an infrastructure cost of just a few tho</p><p>6 0.71439582 <a title="1485-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-26-BigData_using_Erlang%2C_C_and_Lisp_to_Fight_the_Tsunami_of_Mobile_Data.html">1362 high scalability-2012-11-26-BigData using Erlang, C and Lisp to Fight the Tsunami of Mobile Data</a></p>

  @ibogost : Disabling features of SimCity due to ineffective central infrastructure is probably the most realistic simulation of the modern city. 
  antirez : The point is simply to show how SSDs can't be considered, currently, as a bit slower version of memory. Their performance characteristics are a lot more about, simply, "faster disks".

<p>Introduction: If Google was a boxer then MapReduce would be a probing right hand that sets up the massive left hook that is  Dremel , Google's—scalable (thousands of CPUs, petabytes of data, trillions of rows), SQL based, columnar, interactive (results returned in seconds), ad-hoc—analytics system. If Google was a magician then MapReduce would be the shiny thing that distracts the mind while the trick goes unnoticed. I say that because even though Dremel has been around internally at Google since 2006, we have not heard a whisper about it. All we've heard about is MapReduce, clones of which have inspired entire new industries.  Tricky .
 
Dremel, according to Brian Bershad, Director of Engineering at Google, is targeted at solving  BigData class problems :

<p>Introduction: One of the top recommendations from the collective wisdom contained in  Real Life Architectures  is to add  monitoring  to your system. Now! Loud is the lament for not adding monitoring early and often. The reason is easy to understand. Without monitoring you don't know what your system is doing which means you can't fix it and you can't improve it. Feedback loops require data.  Some popular monitor options are Munin, Nagios, Cacti and Hyperic. A relatively new entrant is a product called Reconnoiter from Theo Schlossnagle, President and CEO of OmniTI, leading consultants on solving problems of scalability, performance, architecture, infrastructure, and data management. Theo's name might sound familiar. He gives lots of talks and is the author of the very influential  Scalable Internet Architectures  book.   So right away you know Reconnoiter has a good pedigree. As Theo says, their products are born of pain, from the fire of solving real-life problems and that's always a harbinger of</p><p>same-blog 6 0.96677452 <a title="1485-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-01-PRISM%3A_The_Amazingly_Low_Cost_of_%C2%ADUsing_BigData_to_Know_More_About_You_in_Under_a_Minute.html">1485 high scalability-2013-07-01-PRISM: The Amazingly Low Cost of ­Using BigData to Know More About You in Under a Minute</a></p>

How do you structure your application? That’s the question I explored in the article  Beyond Threads And Callbacks . An option I did not talk about, mostly because of my own ignorance, is a powerful stack you may not be all that familiar with: Scala and Akka.
   To remedy my oversight is our acting tour guide, Typesafe’s Viktor Klang, long time Scala hacker and Java enterprise systems architect. Viktor was very patient in answering my questions and was enthusiastic about sharing his knowledge. He’s a guy who definitely knows what he is talking about. 
   I’ve implemented several Actor systems along with the messaging infrastructure, threading, async IO, service orchestration, failover, etc, so I’m innately skeptical about frameworks that remove control from the programmer at</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 An Actor in the    Actor Model    is comprised by 3 distinct pieces:      A behavior   An address   A mailbox      The Address is the thing you send messages to, they are then put into the Mailbox and the Behavior is applied to the messages in the mailbox—one at a time. [sent-24, score-0.437]
</p><p>2 Since only one message is processed at a time, you can view an Actor as an island of consistency, connected to other actors via their Addresses and by sending and receiving messages from them. [sent-25, score-0.455]
</p><p>3 Akka also allows to configure the mailbox implementation on a per-actor basis, which means that some actors might need a bounded one, some might want a priority-based one, some might want a deduplicating one, or fine-tuning things like overflow protection with head-dropping vs. [sent-32, score-0.415]
</p><p>4 Comparing with Threads, Akka Actors are extremely light-weight, clocking in at around 500b per instance, allowing for running many millions of actors on a commodity machine. [sent-34, score-0.255]
</p><p>5 Akka Actors will not be preempted when a higher-priority message arrives, but it is possible to have multiple actors sharing the same mailbox, which can mitigate this if required. [sent-39, score-0.337]
</p><p>6 Actor A receives message B, which entails a potentially risky operation C (could be contacting an external server or do a computation that might blow up) instead of doing that work itself, it may spawn a new actor and let that actor do this risky operation. [sent-44, score-1.07]
</p><p>7 If that operation fails, then the exception is propagated to A (being the "parent") who can decide to restart the failed actor to retry, or perhaps log that it failed. [sent-45, score-0.602]
</p><p>8 When an Actor doesn't have any messages it is not scheduled for execution, and when it gets a message it will attempt to schedule itself with the thread pool if it hasn't already done so. [sent-66, score-0.449]
</p><p>9 HS: Given you can configure the number of messages to  process before handing back the thread to the pool, that makes it a sort of run to completion model and the CPU time isn't bounded? [sent-69, score-0.333]
</p><p>10 HS: When multiple Actors share the same mailbox, if some actor has the CPU, it won't give up the CPU for the higher priority message to be executed? [sent-75, score-0.628]
</p><p>11 If you have 10 Actors sharing a single priority mailbox and a thread pool of 10 Threads,     there is more opportunity for an actor to be done to pick up the high-priority work than if it's a single actor that is currently processing a slow and low priority message. [sent-77, score-1.452]
</p><p>12 When you create an Akka Actor you specify its name, and the address of the actor is a URI of its place in the hierarchy. [sent-85, score-0.494]
</p><p>13 If you need to do look ups of Actors there are 2 different ways, 1 is to create an ActorSelection, which can be described as query of the hierarchy, to which you can send messages and all actors matching the query will get it. [sent-89, score-0.417]
</p><p>14 Or you can use "actorFor" which lets you look up a specific actor using its full URI. [sent-90, score-0.545]
</p><p>15 An indirection that can even be rebound at runtime, migrating actors from one physical node to another without impacting the Address itself. [sent-96, score-0.339]
</p><p>16 val future2 = Future(randomInteger()) // same as above       val future3 = add(future1, future2)    None of the code above is blocking any thread, and the code is declarative and doesn't prescribe _how_ the code will be executed. [sent-130, score-0.388]
</p><p>17 So here we can observe that futures are only completed once, and the way to transform the results or exceptions of a future is to create a new Future which will hold the result of the transformation. [sent-135, score-0.293]
</p><p>18 You could view Futures (with exceptional results) as an on-heap version of exception handling (in contrast to plain ex     Exception handling which is on stack, meaning that any thread can choose to deal with the exception and not only the thread that causes it). [sent-150, score-0.52]
</p><p>19 HS: The actor state machine makes sense of what to do. [sent-160, score-0.542]
</p><p>20 Something that I find useful is "what would I do if the actors were people and they'd be in different locations? [sent-164, score-0.255]

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Mark Travis , Founder of  InfiniSQL . 
 
  InfiniSQL is the specific "Infinitely Scalable RDBMS" to which the title refers. It is free software, and instructions for getting, building, running and testing it are available in the  guide .    Benchmarking  shows that an InfiniSQL cluster can handle over 500,000 complex transactions per second with over 100,000 simultaneous connections, all on twelve small servers. The methods used to test are documented, and the code is all available so that any practitioner can achieve similar results. There are two main characteristics which make InfiniSQL extraordinary:
  
 It performs transactions with records on multiple nodes better than any clustered/distributed RDBMS 
 It is free, open source. Not just a teaser "community" version with the good stuff proprietary. The community version of InfiniSQL will also be the enterprise version, when it is ready. 
  
InfiniSQL is still in early stages of development--it already has m</p><p>4 0.16193934 <a title="1454-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-10-Hitting_300_SimbleDB_Requests_Per_Second_on_a_Small_EC2_Instance.html">317 high scalability-2008-05-10-Hitting 300 SimbleDB Requests Per Second on a Small EC2 Instance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: High Performance Multithreaded Access to Amazon SimpleDB   is a great  follow up to the idea in  How SimpleDB Differs from a RDBMS  that more programming is the price paid for performance in SimpleDB.  It shows how much work and infrastructure is required to batter better performance out of SimpleDB.   Remember, in SimpleDB you get keys to records from queries so if you want to get all the fields for records you need to make separate requests. Since SimpleDB isn't exactly a speed daemon the obvious strategy is to parallelize.  Even if a job takes a 100 msecs you can get a lot done in a little time if you can execute enough jobs in parallel.   Parallelization is the approach taken by Haakon@AWS  in his Java code example of how to get the most out of SimpleDB. You can find the code at  Indexing and Querying Amazon S3 Metadata with Amazon SimpleDB . We'll also consider how a back-end service architecture built on Erlang may be a better fit with cloud computing.

<p>Introduction: This is a guestrepostby Ron Pressler, the founder and CEO ofParallel Universe,
a Y Combinator company building advanced middleware for real-time
applications. Little's Law helps us determine the maximum request rate a
server can handle. When we apply it, we find that the dominating factor
limiting a server's capacity is not the hardware but theOS.Should we buy more
hardware if software is the problem? If not, how can we remove that software
limitation in a way that does not make the code much harder to write and
understand?Many modern web applications are composed of multiple (often
many)HTTPservices (this is often called a micro-service architecture). This
architecture has many advantages in terms of code reuse and maintainability,
scalability and fault tolerance. In this post I'd like to examine one
particular bottleneck in the approach, which hinders scalability as well as
fault tolerance, and various ways to deal with it (I am using the term
"scalability" very loosely in this post</p><p>6 0.14556424 <a title="1454-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-25-AppBackplane_-_A_Framework_for_Supporting_Multiple_Application_Architectures.html">1429 high scalability-2013-03-25-AppBackplane - A Framework for Supporting Multiple Application Architectures</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hidden in every computer is a hardware backplane for moving signals around. Hidden in every application are ways of moving messages around and giving code CPU time to process them. Unhiding those capabilities and making them first class facilities for the programmer to control is the idea behind AppBackplane.
 
This goes directly against the trend of hiding everything from the programmer and doing it all automagically. Which is great, until it doesn't work. Then it sucks. And the approach of giving the programmer all the power also sucks, until it's tuned to work together and performance is incredible even under increasing loads. Then it's great.
 
These are two different curves going in opposite directions. You need to decide for your application which curve you need to be on.

<p>Introduction: High Performance Multithreaded Access to Amazon SimpleDB   is a great  follow up to the idea in  How SimpleDB Differs from a RDBMS  that more programming is the price paid for performance in SimpleDB.  It shows how much work and infrastructure is required to batter better performance out of SimpleDB.   Remember, in SimpleDB you get keys to records from queries so if you want to get all the fields for records you need to make separate requests. Since SimpleDB isn't exactly a speed daemon the obvious strategy is to parallelize.  Even if a job takes a 100 msecs you can get a lot done in a little time if you can execute enough jobs in parallel.   Parallelization is the approach taken by Haakon@AWS  in his Java code example of how to get the most out of SimpleDB. You can find the code at  Indexing and Querying Amazon S3 Metadata with Amazon SimpleDB . We'll also consider how a back-end service architecture built on Erlang may be a better fit with cloud computing.

What you can do?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guestrepostby Ron Pressler, the founder and CEO ofParallel Universe,
a Y Combinator company building advanced middleware for real-time
applications. Little's Law helps us determine the maximum request rate a
server can handle. When we apply it, we find that the dominating factor
limiting a server's capacity is not the hardware but theOS.Should we buy more
hardware if software is the problem? If not, how can we remove that software
limitation in a way that does not make the code much harder to write and
understand?Many modern web applications are composed of multiple (often
many)HTTPservices (this is often called a micro-service architecture). This
architecture has many advantages in terms of code reuse and maintainability,
scalability and fault tolerance. In this post I'd like to examine one
particular bottleneck in the approach, which hinders scalability as well as
fault tolerance, and various ways to deal with it (I am using the term
"scalability" very loosely in this post</p><p>6 0.7996977 <a title="1454-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-23-Learn_How_to_Exploit_Multiple_Cores_for_Better_Performance_and_Scalability.html">636 high scalability-2009-06-23-Learn How to Exploit Multiple Cores for Better Performance and Scalability</a></p>

How do you structure your application? That’s the question I explored in the article  Beyond Threads And Callbacks . An option I did not talk about, mostly because of my own ignorance, is a powerful stack you may not be all that familiar with: Scala and Akka.
   To remedy my oversight is our acting tour guide, Typesafe’s Viktor Klang, long time Scala hacker and Java enterprise systems architect. Viktor was very patient in answering my questions and was enthusiastic about sharing his knowledge. He’s a guy who definitely knows what he is talking about.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Jeff Su  from Factual. 
 
 
  What is Varnish?  
 Varnish  is an open source, high performance http accelerator that sits in front of a web stack and caches pages.  This caching layer is very configurable and can be used for both static and dynamic content.
 
One great thing about Varnish is that it can improve the performance of your website without requiring any code changes.  If you haven’t heard of Varnish (or have heard of it, but haven’t used it), please read on.  Adding Varnish to your stack can be completely noninvasive, but if you tweak your stack to play along with some of varnish’s more advanced features, you’ll be able to increase performance by orders of magnitude.
 
Some of the high profile companies using Varnish include:  Twitter ,  Facebook ,  Heroku  and  LinkedIn .
  Our Use Case  
One of Factual’s first high profile projects was  Newsweek’s “America’s Best High Schools: The List” .

<p>Introduction: Imagine if you will that car rental agencies rented cars like programmers are hired at many software companies...   Agency  : So sorry you had to wait in the reception area for an hour. Nobody knew you were coming to today. I finally found 8 people to interview before we can rent you a car. If we like you you may have to come in for another round of interviews tomorrow because our manager isn't in today. I didn't have a chance to read your application, so I'll just start with a question. What car do you drive today?  Applicant  : I drive a 2008 Subaru.  Agency  : That's a shame. We don't have a Subaru to rent you.  Applicant  : That's OK. Any car will do.  Agency  : No, we can only take on clients who know how to drive the cars we stock. We find it's safer that way. There are so many little differences between cars, we just don't want to take a chance.  Applicant  : I have a drivers license. I know how to drive. I've been driving all kinds of cars for 15 years, I am sure I can adapt.</p><p>5 0.85447699 <a title="1454-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-18-The_Clever_Ways_Chrome_Hides_Latency_by_Anticipating_Your_Every_Need.html">1267 high scalability-2012-06-18-The Clever Ways Chrome Hides Latency by Anticipating Your Every Need</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ilya Grigorik has written another wonderful article lavishly detailing the extraordinary tactics Chrome employs to hide network latency from users:  Chrome Networking: DNS Prefetch & TCP Preconnect . Ilya springs some surpising factoids on us, revealing how the web has slowed and super sized:
  
 The size of an average page has grown to 1059kB and is now composed of over  80 subresource requests . 
 An average DNS lookup takes between 60 and 120ms. This creates a 100-200ms of latency before a request can be sent because of th full round-trip (RTT) to perform the TCP handshake. 
 Slow mobile experiences are largely due to the much higher RTT's (200-1000ms) on wireless networks. Reducing the number of outbound connections and the total byte size of your pages is the single best optimization you can make for mobile today.  
  
Chrome reduces apparent latency using a host of clever anticipatory mechanisms:

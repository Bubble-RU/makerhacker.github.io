</p><p>2 Burn the Library  is an uncontentious look at contention where we consider ontological considerations such as: “Simultaneous” is about causality, not clocks and how a last write wins policy increases the entropy of the universe via data loss. [sent-26, score-0.07]
</p><p>3 LinkedIn:  Using set cover algorithm to optimize query latency for a large scale distributed graph : we have developed a distributed and partitioned graph system that scales to hundreds of millions of members and their connections and handles hundreds of thousands of queries per second. [sent-32, score-0.116]
</p><p>4 The problem solved is that the routing algorithm would route requests for two pieces of data that were actually collocated to different nodes. [sent-34, score-0.172]
</p><p>5 Wow, a tricky attack on sessions that depends on sessions not being transactional. [sent-46, score-0.26]
</p><p>6 When users are verified and when sessions are set are not in a transaction and this can be used as an attack. [sent-47, score-0.13]
</p><p>7 This leads to a good idea of what should be stored in a sessions: user id, session id, temporary state. [sent-48, score-0.124]
</p><p>8 Though I'm not sure why user id is necessary if you have a session id. [sent-49, score-0.123]
</p><p>9 Mathematical approaches – modeling historical processes with differential equations or agent-based simulations; sophisticated statistical approaches to data analysis – are a key ingredient in the cliodynamic research program. [sent-57, score-0.178]
</p><p>10 But ultimately the aim is to discover general principles that explain the functioning and dynamics of actual historical societies. [sent-58, score-0.203]
</p><p>11 The first 2x means that there are two different kinds of scalability: horizontal scaling over multiple servers, and vertical scaling for performance on a single server. [sent-62, score-0.116]
</p><p>12 The remaining 2×2 means that there are two key features needed to achieve the horizontal and vertical scaling, and for each of those, there are two additional things you have to do to make the features practical. [sent-63, score-0.172]
</p><p>13 Here's a very good introduction to  FPGA Programming for the Masses : FPGAs have programmable logic cells that could be used to implement an arbitrary logic function both spatially and temporally. [sent-66, score-0.133]
</p><p>14 In addition to the conventional reconfiguration capability where the entire FPGA fabric is programmed with an image before execution, FPGAs are also capable of undergoing partial dynamic reconfiguration. [sent-70, score-0.067]
</p><p>15 Firstly, I thought it was about time I reviewed the current status of Java lock implementations. [sent-81, score-0.073]
</p><p>16 Secondly, that although StampedLock looks like a good addition to the JDK, it seems to miss the fact that lock-free algorithms are often a better solution to the multiple reader case. [sent-82, score-0.12]
</p><p>17 Using a collection of Bloom filter chains, a novel approximate candidate generation algorithm called BWAND is able to perform both conjunctive and disjunctive retrieval. [sent-89, score-0.337]

<p>Introduction: Update 8 :  The Cost of Latency  by James Hamilton. James summarizing some latency info from      Steve Souder ,   Greg Linden , and   Marissa Mayer .      Speed [is] an undervalued and under-discussed asset on the web. 
 
 Update 7:   How do you know when you need more memcache servers? . Dathan Pattishall talks about using memcache not to scale, but to reduce latency and reduce I/O spikes, and how to use stats to know when more servers are needed.  Update 6:   Stock Traders Find Speed Pays, in Milliseconds . Goldman Sachs is making record profits off a  500 millisecond  trading advantage. Yes, latency matters. As an interesting aside, Libet found 500 msecs is about the time it takes the brain to weave together an experience of consciousness from all our sensor inputs.  Update 5:   Shopzilla's Site Redo - You Get What You Measure .

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.   Let's take a short trip down web architecture lane:
  It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl scripts and a SQL database   It's 1995: Scale-up the database.   It's 1998: LAMP   It's 1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SAN   It's 2001: In-memory data-grid.   It's 2003: Add a caching layer.   It's 2004: Add scale-out and partitioning.   It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a distributed file system.   It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.   It's 2008: C</p><p>4 0.15624008 <a title="1509-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

  @tapbot_paul : The 2 computers on the Curiosity rover are RAD750 based, they are approximately 1/10th the speed of an iPhone 4s and “only” cost $200k each. 
  @merv : #cassandra12 Why @adrianco loves what he's doing: "You are no longer IO-bound, you’re CPU bound, like you’re supposed to be." 
  @maxtaco : Garbage collection solves a minuscule %age of bugs, that are non-critical (memleaks? big deal!) and easy to find and fix. At a HUGE expense. 
 
 
  @merv : #cassandra12 @eddie_satterly describing $1M savings in first year migrating from MS SQL Server with SAN to Cassandra solution - w more data.

  Seymour Cray : A supercomputer is a device for turning compute-bound problems into IO-bound problems. 
  Robert Sapolsky : And why is self-organization so beautiful to my atheistic self? Because if complex, adaptive systems don’t require a blue print, they don’t require a blue print maker. If they don’t require lightning bolts, they don’t require Someone hurtling lightning bolts.

  Thad Starner : the longer accessing a device exceeds 2s, the more its actually usage would decrease exponentially. Thus, he made a claim that wrist watch interface always sitting on one's wrist ready to use should be more successful than mobile phones which have to pulled out of the pocket.

 Richard Feynman: Suppose that little things behave very differently than anything big 
  @orgnet : "Data, data everywhere, but not a thought to think" -- John Allen Paulos, Mathematician 
  @ bcarlso  : just throw out the word " scalability  ". That'll bring em out  
  @ codypo  :  Here are the steps to the Scalability Shuffle. 1: log everything. 2: analyze logs. 3: profile. 4: refactor. 5: repeat.  
  @ FoggSeastack  :  If math had been taught in a relevant way I might have been a   # BigData    person today.  
  @secboffin : I know a programming joke about 10,000 mutexes, but it's a bit contentious.

  @dthume : "Fault tolerance implies scalability" - Joe Armstrong,  
  @jessiekeck : Looks like my local bar takes the same approach to scalability with their paper towels as I do w/ software. http://pic.twitter.com/DTL2W1eC 
  @neil_conway : Weird: network locality is no longer important within a DC and yet communication predicted to dominate computation cost in manycore CPUs

 With this new pricing, developments will be driven by the costs .  I like to optimize my apps to make them better or faster, but to optimize them just to make them cheaper is a waste of time.  -- Sylvain on  Google Groups 
 
The dream is dead. Google App Engine's bold  pay for what you use  dream dies as it leaves childish things behind and becomes a  real product .  Pricing will change . Architectures will change. Customers will change. Hearts and minds will change. But Google App Engine  will survive.   
 
Google is  shutting down  many of its  projects . GAE is not among them. Do we have GAE's pricing change to thank for it surving the  more wood behind  more deadly arrows push?

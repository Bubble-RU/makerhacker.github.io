<p>Introduction: There's a popular line of thought that says don't waste time on optimization
because developing features is more important than saving money. True, you can
always add resources, but at some point, especially in a more mature part of a
product lifecycle: performance equals $$$.Two great examples of this evolution
come from Facebook and Google. The upshot is that when you spend time and
money on optimizing your tool chain you can get huge wins in performance,
control, and costs. Certainly, don't bother if you are just starting, but at
some point you may want to switch to big development efforts in improving
efficiency.Facebook and HipHopThe Facebook example is quite well known:HipHop,
a static PHP compiler released in 2010, after two years of development. PHP
because Facebook implements their web tierin PHP. They've now developed a
dynamic compiler,HipHop VM, using techniques like JIT, side exits, HipHop
bytecode, type prediction, and parallel tracelet linking.This is an incredible

<p>Introduction: Aditya Agarwal, Director of Engineering at Facebook, gave an excellent Scale
at Facebooktalk that covers their architecture, but the talk is really more
about how to scale an organization by preserving the best parts of its
culture. The key take home of the talk is: You can get the code right, you can
get the products right, but you need to get the culture right first. If you
don't get the culture right then your company won't scale.This leads into the
four meta secrets of scaling at Facebook:Scaling takes IterationDon't Over
DesignChoose the right tool for the job, but realize that your choice comes
with overhead.Get the culture right. Move Fast \- break things. Huge Impact \-
small teams. Be bold \- innovate.Some Background Facebook is big: 400 million
active users; users spend an average of 20 minutes a day; 5 billion pieces of
content (status updates, comments, likes, photo uploads, video uploads, chat
messages, inbox messages, group events, fan pages, friend connections) are

<p>Introduction: Recently I had to help users on one of my opensource project ISPMan.
http://ispman.netThis project started in 2001 as I was too unwilling to take
care of the DNS and VitualHosting stuff as it was a side-thing to the company
I worked for (so i wrote a software that took care of all these little
details)Summary: A large project that needs a rewrite can be done in a matter
of day.I will not give you a full case study about a project that went through
a re-write but a case study about how easy it is to re-write
something.breakDetails:My boss was cool enough to let me open-source the
project and obviously, I got a lot of cool-cred out of it.Later on I also did
some support and implementation and earned quiet some money with it.Eventually
I had to let the project go out of my hand to the community as I only did it
to facilitate a job that wasnt williing to do. (Setup DNS zones of multiple

immediately latched on to one of his key example scenarios, which involves

PHP front-end● In PHP, Java, C#, whatever– How long would it take you to
reproduce Facebook's first incarnation?● A single MySQL instance with some
simple queries probably used to happily query the whole userbase.Facebook●
What is it today?● Its not about “that stuff you learned in school”– Its about
what a company with thousands of (possibly conflicting) queries per second
operatingon a directed-graph with 50 million nodes● And of course a few
Petabytes of data● And 99.99% uptime● Design decision? A Facebook user is (or
recently was) currently limited to 5000 friends.If you've been reading all the

<p>Introduction: If you code in PHP have you ever wondered about moving to Facebook'sHipHop JIT
Virtual Machine for PHP? With HipHop Facebook achieved over a 9x increase in
web request throughput and over a 5x reduction in memory consumption compared
to Zend PHP 5.2 engine + APC.But will HipHop really work for you? Is it really
drop-in compatible? Is it really as fast as they say?To answer questions like
this nothing beats a good experience report and here's a great one:Adventures
in Configuring and Running Facebook's HipHopVM (hhvm) JIT Compiler for PHP by
Yermo Lamers.Yermo selected PHP to implement a number of content web sites. He
took an interesting approach, he created a forms, views, validation, and
business logic description language to remove the drudgery of creating the
same code over and over again for each page. Having done this in Perl I think
it's a great a approach. The problem is it can be slow. PHP's slow string
handling makes dynamically evaluating a description template for each page</p><p>2 0.92757797 <a title="1561-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-03-Leslie_Lamport_to_Programmers%3A_You%27re_Doing_it_Wrong.html">1625 high scalability-2014-04-03-Leslie Lamport to Programmers: You're Doing it Wrong</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Famous computer scientist Leslie Lamport is definitely not a worse is
betterkind of guy. In Computation and State Machines he wants to make the case
that to get better programs we need to teach programmers to think better. And
programmers will think better when they learn to think in terms of concepts
firmly grounded in the language of mathematics.I was disappointed that there
was so much English in the paper. Surely it would have been more convincing if
it was written as a mathematical proof. Or would it?This whole topic has been
argued extensively throughout thousands of years of philosophy. Mathematics
has always been a strange attractor for those trying to escape a flawed human
rationality. In the end as alluring as the utopia of mathematics is, it lacks
a coherent theory of meaning and programming is not about rearranging
ungrounded symbols, it's about manipulating and shaping meaning.For
programmers I thinkLudwig Wittgensteinhas the right sense of things. Meaning
is derived by us</p><p>3 0.90580422 <a title="1561-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-09-The_Story_of_How_Turning_Disk_Into_a_Service_Lead_to_a_Deluge_of_Density.html">1384 high scalability-2013-01-09-The Story of How Turning Disk Into a Service Lead to a Deluge of Density</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We usually think of the wonderful advantages of service oriented
architectures as a software thing, but it also applies to hardware. InSecurity
Now 385, that Doyen of Disk,Steve Gibson, tells the fascinating story (@ about
41:30) of how moving to a service oriented architecture in hard drives,
modeling a drive as a linear stream of sectors, helped create the amazing high
density disk drives we enjoy today.When drives switched to use
theIDE(integrated drive electronics) interface, the controller function moved
into the drive instead of the computer. No longer were low level drive signals
moved across cables and into the motherboard. Now we just ask the drive for
the desired sector and the drive takes care of it.This allowed manufacturers
to do anything they wanted to behind the IDE interface. The drive stopped
being dumb, it became smart, providing a sort of sector service. Density sky
rocketed because there was no dependency on the computer. All the internals
could completely change as</p><p>4 0.90544081 <a title="1561-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-25-Colmux_-_Finding_Memory_Leaks%2C_High_I-O_Wait_Times%2C_and_Hotness_on_3000_Node_Clusters.html">1104 high scalability-2011-08-25-Colmux - Finding Memory Leaks, High I-O Wait Times, and Hotness on 3000 Node Clusters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Todd had originally posted an entry oncollectlhere atCollectl - Performance
Data Collector. Collectl collects real-time data from a large number of
subsystems like buddyinfo, cpu, disk, inodes, infiniband, lustre, memory,
network, nfs, processes, quadrics, slabs, sockets and tcp, all using one tool
and in one consistent format.Since then a lot has happened.  It's now part of
both Fedora and Debian distros, not to mention several others. There has also
been a pretty good summary written up byJoe Brockmeier. It's also pretty well
documented (I like to think) onsourceforge. There have also been a few blog
postings by Martin Bachon his blog.Anyhow, awhile back I released a new
version of collectl-utils and gave a complete face-lift to one of the
utilities, colmux, which is a collectl multiplexor.  This tool has the ability
to run collectl on multiple systems, which in turn send all their output back
to colmux.  Colmux then sorts the output on a user-specified column and
reports the 'top-n'</p><p>5 0.89179558 <a title="1561-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-06-DyradLINQ.html">592 high scalability-2009-05-06-DyradLINQ</a></p>

<p>Introduction: SinceThe Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage was published we've a had
few updates that people might not have seen. Amazon of course released their
Summary of the Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS Service Disruption in the US East
Region. Netlix shared theirLessons Learned from the AWS Outage as did Heroku
(How Heroku Survived the Amazon Outage), Smug Mug (How SmugMug survived the
Amazonpocalypse), and SimpleGeo (How SimpleGeo Stayed Up During the AWS
Downtime). The curious thing from my perspective is the general lack of
response to Amazon's explanation. I expected more discussion. There's been
almost none that I've seen. My guess is very few people understand what Amazon
was talking about enough to comment whereas almost everyone feels qualified to
talk about the event itself.Lesson for crisis handlers: deep dive post-mortems
that are timely, long, honestish, and highly technical are the most effective
means of staunching the downward spiral of media attention. Amazon's

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byPatrick Eaton, Software Engineer and Distributed
Systems Architect at Stackdriver.Stackdriver provides intelligent monitoring-
as-a-service for cloud hosted applications.  Behind this easy-to-use service
is a large distributed system for collecting and storing metrics and events,
monitoring and alerting on them, analyzing them, and serving up all the
results in a web UI.  Because we ourselves run in the cloud (mostly on AWS),
we spend a lot of time thinking about how to deal with faults in the cloud.
We have developed a framework for thinking about fault mitigation for large,
cloud-hosted systems.  We endearingly call this framework the "Four Hamiltons"
because it is inspired by an article from James Hamilton, the Vice President
and Distinguished Engineer at Amazon Web Services.The article that led to this
framework is called "The Power Failure Seen Around the World".  Hamilton
analyzes the causes of the power outage that affected Super Bowl XLVII in
early 2013.</p><p>4 0.13341488 <a title="1403-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-07-Startups_are_Creating_a_New_System_of_the_World_for_IT.html">1240 high scalability-2012-05-07-Startups are Creating a New System of the World for IT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: In the "should I or shouldn't I" debate around deploying SSD, it always helps
to have real-world data. Fiesta! with alive-blog summary of a presentation by
Kenny Gorman onShutterfly on MongoDB Performance Tuning.What if you still need
more performance after doing all of this tuning? One option is to use SSDs.
Shutterfly usesFacebook's flashcache: kernel module to cache data on SSD.
Designed for MySQL/InnoDB. SSD in front of a disk, but exposed as a single
mount point. This only makes sense when you have lots of physical I/O.
Shutterfly saw a speedup of 500% w/ flashcache. A benefit is that you can
delay sharding: less complexity.The wholeseries of posts has a lot of great
information and is worth a longer look, especially if you are considering
using MongoDB. Related ArticlesSlides forMongoSF 2011 slides: MongoDB

<p>Introduction: Update:as of the end of Q2 2011,Akamai had 95,811servers deployed
globally.Akamai is the CDN to the stars. It claims to deliver between 15 and
30 percent of all Web traffic, with major customers like Facebook, Twitter,
Apple, and the US military. Traditionally quite secretive, we get a peek
behind the curtain in this paper: The Akamai Network: A Platform for High-
Performance Internet Applications by Erik Nygren, Ramesh Sitaraman, and
Jennifer Sun. Abstract:Comprising more than 61,000 servers located across
nearly 1,000 networks in 70 countries worldwide, the Akamai platform delivers
hundreds of billions of Internet interactions daily, helping thousands of
enterprises boost the performance and reliability of their Internet
applications. In this paper, we give an overview of the components and
capabilities of this large-scale distributed computing platform, and offer
some insight into its architecture, design principles, operation, and

<p>Introduction: Wildly popular VC blogger Fred Wilson defines in an excellent 27 minute
videothe ten most important criteria he uses when deciding to give the gold,
that is, fund a web application. Note, this video isfrom 2010, so no doubt the
ideas are still valid, but the importance of mobile vs web apps has probably
shifted to mobile, as Mr. Wilson says in a recent post: mobile is growing like
a weed. Speed- speed is more than a feature, it's a requirement. Mainstream
users are unforgiving. If something is slow they won't use it. Pingdom is used
to track speed across their portfolio. A trend they've noticed is that as an
application slows down they don't grow as quickly. Instant Utility- a service
must be instantly useful to users. Lengthy setup and configuration is a
killer. Tricks like crawling the web to populate information you expect to get
from your users later makes the service initially useful. YouTube won, for
example, with instant availability of uploaded video.Voice- Consumer software

<p>Introduction: The world of scalable databases is not a simple one. They come in every race,
creed, and color. Rick Cattell has brought some harmony to that world by
publishingHigh Performance Scalable Data Stores, a nicely detailed one stop
shop paper comparing scalable databases soley on the content of their
character. Ironically, the first step in that evaluation is dividing the world
into four groups:Key-value stores: Redis, Scalaris, Voldmort, and
Riak.Document stores: Couch DB, MongoDB, and SimpleDB.Record stores: BigTable,
HBase, HyperTable, and Cassandra.Scalable RDBMSs: MySQL Cluster, ScaleDB,
Drizzle, and VoltDB.The paper describes each system and then compares them on
the dimensions of Concurrency Control, Data Storage Replication, Transaction
Model, General Comments, Maturity, K-hits, License Language.And the winner is:
there are no winners. Yet. Rick concludes by pointing to a great convergence:I

</p><p>4 The fear is for large web apps the nature of JavaScript puts crippling limits on potential performance improvements, which will cause  web apps to lose out to mobile apps. [sent-9, score-0.166]
</p><p>5 Before you scream in protest, Dart is created by the same guys who  worked on V8 , so all their JavaScript experience has fed into Dart. [sent-10, score-0.131]
</p><p>6 John’s pitch is that despite many assertions to the contrary, the web is not fast. [sent-11, score-0.136]
</p><p>7 For example, when comparing the performance of a 2D physics engine across C and the web, the web version is 20x slower than C. [sent-12, score-0.115]
</p><p>8 You may be wondering which of the gazillion web frameworks to use and Dart may just be on the edge of your radar. [sent-16, score-0.1]
</p><p>9 Strangely though the type system is enforced by tools, it’s not a property of the language. [sent-21, score-0.076]
</p><p>10 Dart is designed to run fast by being less permissive than JavaScript. [sent-28, score-0.127]
</p><p>11 Newly written from scratch VM that is designed specifically for Dart and is designed to be fast. [sent-29, score-0.068]

</p><p>13 Distinction between growable and fixed sized arrays. [sent-38, score-0.118]
</p><p>14 If you know the size of an array ahead of time then you can make it fixed sized array, which gives Dart more optimization opportunities. [sent-39, score-0.194]
</p><p>15 In Dart you extract the class ID go to the class a grab the function. [sent-43, score-0.068]
</p><p>16 SIMD means single instruction multiple data, which means an operation is applied in parallel to an array of data rather than to one piece of data at a time. [sent-49, score-0.079]
</p><p>17 This makes areas like 3G graphics, 3D physics, image processing, signal processing, and numerical processing, blisteringly fast. [sent-50, score-0.114]
</p><p>18 For Dart to win it must provide speed improvements so compelling that other applications are put at a clear competitive disadvantage, and not just in graphics intensive applications. [sent-54, score-0.124]

<p>Introduction: Release early and often. A/B testing. Creating a landing page and buying ads on AdSense. All are ways of providing quick feedback in order to validate an idea. If you are like Zynga, with 250 million active users a month, how do you cost effectively prove out a game that could flop or get 90 million users (like CityVille) in an instant?
 
Zynga handles this problem inlle an innovative way, by inverting the typical cloud burst scenario that has excess traffic flowing from a datacenter to a cloud, to having a game start in the cloud and then moving to the datacenter once the game has proved popular enough to keep.
 
This process is nicely described by Charles Babcock in  Lessons From FarmVille: How Zynga Uses The Cloud , in an interview with Allan Leinwand, CTO of infrastructure engineering at Zynga.
 
When paired down to its essence, Zynga's strategy goes something like this:

<p>Introduction: Update:   Offloading ALL JS Files To Google . Now you can let Google serve all your javascript files.  This article tells you how to do it (upload to Google Code Project) and why it's a big win (cheap, fast, caching, parallel downloads, save bandwidth).  Don't have a CDN? Why not let Google and Yahoo be your CDN? At least for Ajax libraries.  No charge. Google runs a  content distribution network and loading architecture for the most popular open source JavaScript libraries , which include: jQuery, prototype, script.aculo.us, MooTools, and dojo. The idea is web pages directly include your library of choice from Google's global, fast, and highly available network. Some have found much better performance and others experienced slower performance.  My guess is the performance may be slower if your data center is close to you, but far away users will be much happier. Some negatives: not all libraries are included, you'll load more than you need because all functionality is included.

<p>Introduction: Joseph Smarr, former CTO of Plaxo (which explains why I recognized his picture), in  I'm a technical lead on the Google+ team. Ask me anything , reveals the stack used for building Google+:
  Our stack is pretty standard fare for Google apps these days: we use Java servlets for our server code and JavaScript for the browser-side of the UI, largely built with the (open-source) Closure framework, including Closure's JavaScript compiler and template system. A couple nifty tricks we do: we use the HTML5 History API to maintain pretty-looking URLs even though it's an AJAX app (falling back on hash-fragments for older browsers); and we often render our Closure templates server-side so the page renders before any JavaScript is loaded, then the JavaScript finds the right DOM nodes and hooks up event handlers, etc. to make it responsive (as a result, if you're on a slow connection and you click on stuff really fast, you may notice a lag before it does anything, but luckily most people don't run</p><p>5 0.67146826 <a title="1427-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-13-Benchmark_for_keeping_data_in_browser_in_AJAX_projects.html">565 high scalability-2009-04-13-Benchmark for keeping data in browser in AJAX projects</a></p>

<p>Introduction: John McCutchan ,   after a long career spent working on the Linux kernel and being hired out as a code optimization guru, joined Google's Dart team. A curious hire until you watch  Bringing SIMD to the Web via Dart , where John makes a programmer accessible explanation of why he likes Dart: performance, performance, performance.  
    Dart    is an open-source Web programming language    developed by Google   . The motivation for Dart is twofold: provide a language capable of scaling up to the complex web applications that are becoming the norm. Think Gmail. And provide a single language capable of working on both the client and server. Towards those ends Dart is a complete language, full tool environment, and provides an advanced Web UI framework for building web applications at a high level of abstraction. 
   Why isn't JavaScript good enough? The fear is for large web apps the nature of JavaScript puts crippling limits on potential performance improvements, which will cause  web app</p><p>2 0.9171229 <a title="1427-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-13-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_13%2C_2012.html">1227 high scalability-2012-04-13-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 13, 2012</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's HighScalability Time:
  
  50 million in 50 days  : Draw Something downloads;  40 million concurrent users  : Skype 
 Key to making sensors ubiquitous is getting the BOM cost down. Here's a dream way of making that happen:  Bye-Bye Batteries: Radio Waves as a Low-Power Source . “Silicon technology has advanced to the point where even tiny amounts of energy can do useful work.” No batteries == cheaper, smaller products == ubiquity. 
  The MySQL “swap insanity” problem and the effects of the NUMA architecture . Jeremy Cole with a spectacular article on the differences between NUMA and SMP/UMA systems and the mostly unsatisfactory tricks required to get MySQL to perform on NUMA systems. There are really two issues: the evils of an OS controlled swap and NUMA performance effects due to a single node (in the NUMA sense) running out of memory. This is the kind of stuff you only see when you push your systems to the edge. Also,  Measuring NUMA effects with the STREAM benchmark ,  MongoDB</p><p>3 0.90629852 <a title="1427-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-10-Let%27s_Play_a_Game_of_Take_It_or_Leave_It__-_Game_1.html">1608 high scalability-2014-03-10-Let's Play a Game of Take It or Leave It  - Game 1</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The way this game is played is you read a few statements on some hot topics below. If you agree with a statement then you “take it”; if you disagree then you “leave it.” And if you are so moved please write a convincing comment as to why. Got it?
  
 

  Snowden vs. the State.  Snowden represents true the spirit of freedom and is not a threat to all we hold dear. 

 
 

  Walled Garden vs. Federated Freedom.  The Walled Garden has won the last decade. The cycle of life will return the balance and federated services will once again win the day. 

 
 

  Mobile + messaging vs. Le Web.  Mobile + messaging is eating search and the web, changing the way things are found, discovered, and bought.  

 
 

  Fiat vs. Cryptocurrency.  BitCoin has had its 400 million dollars of fame, it’s on the way out, a tulip gone out of bloom.

<p>Introduction: Update:  Presentation: Second Life’s Architecture .  Ian Wilkes, VP of Systems Engineering, describes the architecture used by the popular game named Second Life. Ian presents how the architecture was at its debut and how it evolved over years as users and features have been added.    Second Life  is a 3-D virtual world created by its Residents. Virtual Worlds are expected to be more and more popular on the internet so their architecture might be of interest. Especially important is the appearance of open virtual worlds or metaverses.  What happens when video games meet Web 2.0? What happens is the  metaverse  .

 Upgrades are the great killer of software systems. Do you really want a  pill that would supply materials  with instructions for   nanobots   to form new neurons and place them near existing cells to be replaced so you have a new brain within six months? Scary as hell. But there's an   nanoapp   for that.

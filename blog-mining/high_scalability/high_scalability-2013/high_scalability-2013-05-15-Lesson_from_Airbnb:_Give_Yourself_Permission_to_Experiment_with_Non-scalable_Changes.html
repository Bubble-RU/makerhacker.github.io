<p>Introduction: The fascination over Instagram continues and fortunately we have several new
streams of information to feed the insanity. So consider this article an
update toThe Instagram Architecture Facebook Bought For A Cool Billion
Dollars, based primarily onScaling Instagram, a slide deck for an AirBnB tech
talk given by Instagram co-founder, Mike Krieger. Several other information
sources, listed at the bottom of the article, were also used.Unfortunately we
just have a slide deck, so the connective tissue of the talk is missing, but
it's still very interesting, in the same spirit of wisdom presentations we
often see after developers come up for air after spending significant time
spent in the trenches.If you expect to dive deep into the technological
details and find a billion reasons why Instagram was acquired, you will be
disappointed. That magic can be found in the emotional investment in the
relationship between all of the users and the product, not in the bits about
how they bytes are mana</p><p>3 0.072882771 <a title="1458-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-19-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_19%2C_2013.html">1494 high scalability-2013-07-19-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 19, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you are stuck drowning in too much data and too many options and are
dazzled by all the possibilities of code, here's a helpful bit of advice from
Airbnb's rags to richesorigin story:it's okay to do things that don't scale. A
corollary is the idea of paying attention to and learning from what your users
are actually doing and let that lead you without out that annoying voice in
your head second guessing you, yelling but that will never scale! Worry about
building something good, then worry about making it scale.In Airbnb's case
they noticed people weren't booking rooms because the pictures sucked. So they
flew to New York and shot some beautiful images. This is a very non-scalable
and non-technical solution. Yet it was the turning point for Airbnb and
sparked their climb out of the "trough of sorrow." Previously they had been
limited by the Silicon Valley idea that every feature had to be scalable. Not

quest. Melodramatic much? Sorry, but while wandering dazzled throughRace to
the End of the Earth, a fantastic exhibit at theRoyal BC Museumon the
1911-1912race to the South Polebetween Norwegian explorerRoald Amundsenand
British naval officerRobert Scott, I couldn't help but think of the two
radically different approaches each team took to the race and it shocked me to
see that some of the same principles that lead to success or failure in
software development also seem to lead to success or failure in exploration.I
wish I could reproduce the experience ofwalking through the exhibit. Plaque
after plaque I remember wondering out loud at Scott's choices and then nod in
agreement with Amundsen's approach. The core conflict was straight out of any
ancient Agile (Amundsen) vs Waterfall (Scott) thread you can find on Usenet.
And Waterfall lost.As background here are some sources you may want to read to

<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble in an often poignantFriendFeed threadcommiserating PodTech's
unfortunate end, shared what he learned about creating a successful startup.
Here's a summary of a Robert's rules and why Machiavelli just may agree with
them:Have a story.Have everyone on board with that story.If anyone goes off of
that story, make sure they get on board immediately or fire them.Make sure
people are judged by the revenues they bring in. Those that bring in revenues
should get to run the place. People who don't bring in revenues should get
fewer and fewer responsibilities, not more and more.Work ONLY for a leader who
will make the tough decisions.Build a place where excellence is expected,
allowed, and is enabled.Fire idiots quickly.If your engineering team can't
give a media team good measurements, the entire company is in trouble. Only
things that are measured ever get improved.When your stars aren't listened to
the company is in trouble.Getting rid of the CEO, even if it's all his fault,

<p>Introduction: My favorite kind of histories are those told from an insider's perspective.
The story of Richard the Lionheart is full of great battles and dynastic
intrigue. The story of one of his soldiers, not so much. Yet the soldiers'
story, as someone who has experienced the real consequences of decisions made
and actions taken, is more revealing.We get such a history in Chat Wars, a
wonderful article written by David Auerbach, who in 1998 worked at Microsoft
on MSN Messenger Service, Microsoft's instant messaging app (for a related
story see The Rise and Fall of AIM, the Breakthrough AOL Never Wanted).It's as
if Herodotus visited Microsoft and wrote down his experiences. It has that
same sort of conversational tone, insightful on-the-ground observations, and
facts no outsider might ever believe.Much of the article is a play-by-play
account of the cat and mouse game David plays changing Messenger to track
AOL's Instant Messenger protocol changes. AOL repeatedly tried to make it so

hired at many software companies...Agency: So sorry you had to wait in the
reception area for an hour. Nobody knew you were coming to today. I finally
found 8 people to interview before we can rent you a car. If we like you you
may have to come in for another round of interviews tomorrow because our
manager isn't in today. I didn't have a chance to read your application, so
I'll just start with a question. What car do you drive today?Applicant: I
drive a 2008 Subaru.Agency: That's a shame. We don't have a Subaru to rent
you.Applicant: That's OK. Any car will do.Agency: No, we can only take on
clients who know how to drive the cars we stock. We find it's safer that way.
There are so many little differences between cars, we just don't want to take
a chance.Applicant: I have a drivers license. I know how to drive. I've been
driving all kinds of cars for 15 years, I am sure I can adapt. Agency: We

<p>Introduction: Funcis used to manage a large network using bash or Python scripts. It targets
easy and simple remote scripting and one-off tasks over SSH by creating a
secure (SSL certifications) XMLRPC API for communication. Any kind of
application can be written on top of it. Other configuration management tools
specialize in mass configuration. They say here's what the machine should look
like and keep it that way. Func allows you to program your cluster. If you've
ever tried to securely remote script a gang of machines using SSH keys you
know what a total nightmare that can be.Some example commands:Using the
command line:func "*.example.org" call yumcmd updateUsing the Pthon API:import
func.overlord.client as fcclient = fc.Client("*.example.org;*.example.com")cli
ent.yumcmd.update()client.service.start("acme-server")print
client.hardware.info()Func may certainly overlap in functionality with other
tools like Puppet and cfengine, but as programmers we always need more than
one way to do it and def</p><p>same-blog 2 0.81241173 <a title="1458-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-15-Lesson_from_Airbnb%3A_Give_Yourself_Permission_to_Experiment_with_Non-scalable_Changes.html">1458 high scalability-2013-05-15-Lesson from Airbnb: Give Yourself Permission to Experiment with Non-scalable Changes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are stuck drowning in too much data and too many options and are
dazzled by all the possibilities of code, here's a helpful bit of advice from
Airbnb's rags to richesorigin story:it's okay to do things that don't scale. A
corollary is the idea of paying attention to and learning from what your users
are actually doing and let that lead you without out that annoying voice in
your head second guessing you, yelling but that will never scale! Worry about
building something good, then worry about making it scale.In Airbnb's case
they noticed people weren't booking rooms because the pictures sucked. So they
flew to New York and shot some beautiful images. This is a very non-scalable
and non-technical solution. Yet it was the turning point for Airbnb and
sparked their climb out of the "trough of sorrow." Previously they had been
limited by the Silicon Valley idea that every feature had to be scalable. Not
every solution can be found behind a computer screen.For the full story please

<p>Introduction: Playing like the big boys may be getting cheaper. The big boys, likeYouTube,
farm the serving of their most popular videos to a third party CDN. A lot of
people were surprised YouTube didn't serve all their content themselves, but
it makes sense. It allows them to keep up with demand without a large hit for
infrastructure build out, much like leasing computers instead of buying
them.breakThe problem has been CDNs are expensive. Om Malik reports inAkamai &
the CDN Price Warsthat may be changing. CDN service could be becoming
affordable enough that you might consider using them as part of your scaling
strategy.Akamai, once the clear leader in the CDN field, is facing strong
competition from the likes of Limelight Networks, Level 3, Internap,
CDNetworks, Panther Express and EdgeCast Networks.Thiscommoditizationmay be
bad for their stock prices, but it's good for website builders looking for new
scaling strategies. EdgeCast, for example, passes on the cost savings when
when their bandwidth</p><p>4 0.63304049 <a title="1458-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-06-Product%3A_Resque_-_GitHub%27s_Distrubuted_Job_Queue.html">738 high scalability-2009-11-06-Product: Resque - GitHub's Distrubuted Job Queue</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Queuing work forprocessing in the backgroundis a time testedscalability
strategy. Queuing also happens to be one of those much needed tools where it
easy enough to forge for your own that we see a lot of different versions
made.Resque is GitHub'stake on a job queue and they've used it to process
million and millions of jobs so far.What is Resque?Redis-backedlibrary for
creating background jobs, placing those jobs on multiple queues, and
processing them later. Background jobs can be any Ruby class or module that
responds to perform. Your existing classes can easily be converted to
background jobs or you can create new classes specifically to do work. Or, you
can do both.GitHub tried and considered many other systems: SQS, Starling,
ActiveMessaging, BackgroundJob, DelayedJob, beanstalkd, AMQP,  and Kestrel,
but found them all wanting in one way are another. The latency for SQS was too
high. Others didn't make full use of Ruby. Others still had a lot of overhead.

<p>Introduction: A conjunction of a few new technologies may trigger disruptive changes in the
future. This observation was prompted by a talkSteve Perlmangave at the
Columbia Engineering School: Benjamin Button, Cloud Everything and Why
Shannon's Law Isn't. In it he covers a set of technologies that at first may
seem unrelated, but turn out to be deeply related after all, culminating in a
realization of the long talked about vision of an application utility, where
all applications are hosted and run out of the cloud. First Perlman talks
about the realistic human rendering technology developed at Rearden, his
research incubator company. This technology was developed over many years and
is the secret behind the wonderful effects found in movies likeBenjamin
Button. It is now being used in many other films, and promises to
revolutionize film making, possibly even replacing actors with computers, in
real-time.The next invention at Rearden isOnLive, a cloud based gaming

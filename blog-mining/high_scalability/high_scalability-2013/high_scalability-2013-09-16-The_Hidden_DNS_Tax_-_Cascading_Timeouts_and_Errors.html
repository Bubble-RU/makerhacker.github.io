</p><p>5 We've seen it bring down the main web application for a Fortune 10 company. [sent-13, score-0.109]
</p><p>6 A DNS lookup can fail, the user gets an error, and the application logs may never record it. [sent-14, score-0.32]
</p><p>7 Or, a web server may do an IPv4 lookup that hits the timeout threshold after 5 seconds. [sent-15, score-0.277]
</p><p>8 And so on - potentially creating delays that cascade through your applications. [sent-17, score-0.135]
</p><p>9 The DNS Tax is particularly hard to identify, because the transaction requests eventually go through - so they don't show up in the log files as errors. [sent-18, score-0.207]
</p><p>10 The good news is that the Hidden DNS Tax is largelycaused by configuration errors- human mistakes that can be quickly corrected. [sent-21, score-0.125]
</p><p>11 In a web-scale architecture, with rapid release cycles, human error will happen. [sent-24, score-0.165]
</p><p>12 The effect of these DNS errors depends on how the application handles them. [sent-27, score-0.323]

</p><p>14 Others (fairly) gracefully handle 10,000 DNS errors every few hours. [sent-29, score-0.306]
</p><p>15 If a DNS server is overwhelmed or unavailable, the application doing a Lookup waits for a timeout window before giving up. [sent-34, score-0.325]
</p><p>16 This window is often five or more seconds while the user is left waiting. [sent-35, score-0.124]
</p><p>17 The challenge is that timeouts won't be logged, since the server wasn't available to handle the request. [sent-39, score-0.225]
</p><p>18 It's also hard to correlate errors in the logs of a busy DNS with which application component was harmed and by how much. [sent-40, score-0.621]

<p>Introduction: For some special reason, I'm trying to make a web server able to get all the
DNS names mapped to its IP. Let me explain more, I'm creating a website that
will run in a web farm, every web server in the farm will have some subdomains
mapped to its ip, what I want is that whenever my application starts on a web
server is to be able to get all the subdomains mapped/assigned to that server,
e.g. sub1.mydomain.com, sub2.mydomain.com. I understand that I have to use
reverse dns lookup (i.e. give the IP get the domain name), but I also want to
get all the subdomains not just the first one that maps to that IP. I've been
reading about DNS on the internet but I don't seem to find any information on
how to achieve what I want, normally you use dns to get the ip of a domain but
I'm not sure that all servers enable reverse lookup.The problem is that I'm
still not sure whether I'll host my own DNS server or use the services of some
company (many companies offer DNS hosting services), so, my questio</p><p>3 0.25104761 <a title="1517-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-06-GEO-aware_traffic_load_balancing_and_caching_at_CNBC.com.html">773 high scalability-2010-02-06-GEO-aware traffic load balancing and caching at CNBC.com</a></p>
<p>Introduction: CNBC, like many large web sites, relied  on a CDN for content delivery.
Recently, we started looking  to see if we could improve this model.  Our
criteria was:- improve response time- have better control over traffic (real
time reporting, change management and alerting)- better utilize internal
datacenters and their infrastructure- shield users from any troubles at the
origin infrastructure- cost outAfter researching the market, we turned to two
vendors: Dyn (Dynamic Network Services) andaiScaler. We' have had   about a
year worth of experience withaiScaler (search for "CNBC" to see my previous
post ), but Dyn was a new vendor for us.  We started building our relationship
at Velocity conference in the summer of 2009.Dyn has recently started offering
a geo-aware DNS load balancing solution, using Anycast and the distributed

<p>Introduction: A man had a dream. His dream was to blend a bunch of RSS/Atom/RDF feeds into a
single feed. The man is Beau Lebens ofFeedvilleand like most dreamers he was a
little short on coin. So he took refuge in the home of a cheap hosting
provider and Beau realized his dream, creatingFEEDblendr. But FEEDblendr
chewed up so much CPU creating blended feeds that the cheap hosting provider
ordered Beau to find another home. Where was Beau to go? He eventually found a
new home in the virtual machine room of Amazon's EC2. This is the story of how
Beau was finally able to create his one feeds safe within the cradle of
affordable CPU cycles.Site: http://feedblendr.com/The PlatformEC2 (Fedora Core
6 Lite distro)S3ApachePHPMySQLDynDNS (for round robin DNS)The StatsBeau is a
developer with some sysadmin skills, not a web server admin, so a lot of
learning was involved in creating FEEDblendr.FEEDblendr uses 2 EC2 instances.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byJeffrey Damick, Principal Software Engineer forNeustar.
Jeffrey has overseen the software architecture forUltraDNSfor last two and
half years as it went through substantial revitalization.UltraDNS is one the
top the DNS providers, serving manytop-level domains (TLDs)as well assecond-
level domains (SLDs). This requires handling of several hundreds of thousands
of zones with many containing millions of records each. Even with all of its
success UltraDNS had fallen into a rut several years ago, its release schedule
had become haphazard at best and the team was struggling to keep up with
feature requests in a waterfall development style.DevelopmentRealizing that
something had to be done the team came together and identified the most
important areas to attack first. We began with the code base, stabilizing our
flagship proprietary C++ DNS server, instituting common best practices and
automation. Testing was very manual and not easily reproducible, so we brought

<p>Introduction: Amir Salihefendic, founder of Todoist and Wedoist, inHow to create very
reliable web services, has written an insightful post on strategies for
creating reliable web services along with the tools needed to make it
happen.Realtime monitor everything. Create a clear picture of what's going on
at any time both past and present. Keep a log of errors and key application
metrics. Visualize response times and other metrics for every computer in your
network. Tools:statsd,Graphite,Pingdom,Cacti,Nagios.Be proactive. Don't
optimize prematurely, but don't wait to optimize when in a crisis situation.
Anticipate problems before they happen by monitoring and completely
understanding your system. Think now about how to scale your system if load
increases by several orders of magnitude.Be notified when crashes happen. Use
tools likePingdomandcrash_houndto send notifications when problems do
occur.While not secrets in any sense, thearticleis well written and has many
useful details. Worth a look.</p><p>5 0.71311259 <a title="1517-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-30-Feedblendr_Architecture_-_Using_EC2_to_Scale.html">138 high scalability-2007-10-30-Feedblendr Architecture - Using EC2 to Scale</a></p>

new home in the virtual machine room of Amazon's EC2. This is the story of how
Beau was finally able to create his one feeds safe within the cradle of
affordable CPU cycles.Site: http://feedblendr.com/The PlatformEC2 (Fedora Core

<p>Introduction: Benjamin Erb (@b_erb) from Ulm University recently published his diploma
thesis on"Concurrent Programming for Scalable Web Architectures". The thesis
provides a comprehensive survey on different concepts and techniques of
concurrency inside web architectures, including web servers, application logic
and storage backends. It incorporates research publications, hands-on reports
and also regards popular programming languages, frameworks and
databases.Abstract:Web architectures are an important asset for various large-
scale web applications, such as social networks or e-commerce sites. Being
able to handle huge numbers of users concurrently is essential, thus
scalability is one of the most important features of these architectures.
Multi-core processors, highly distributed backend architectures and new web
technologies force us to reconsider approaches for concurrent programming in
order to implement web applications and fulfil scalability demands. While

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byNick Burling, VP of Product Management
ofBluestripe.Readers of High Scalability know are well versed in performance
optimization techniques. Reverse proxies, Varnish, Redis -- you hear about
them daily. But what you may not realize is that one of the oldest
technologies in your stack can be one of your biggest bottlenecks: DNS.People
don't spend a lot of time thinking about DNS. It's not sexy. It's an
infrastructure service, and it's just supposed to work.At BlueStripe, we work
with many teams running applications that support millions of web requests a
day. We keep seeing DNS delays and errors that the platform operations team
never knows about. It's so common we've start calling it theHidden DNS
Tax.What is the Hidden DNS Tax?The Hidden DNS Tax is a hard-to-see performance
hit your users take from DNS timeouts and errors in your back-end
architecture. We've seen it bring down the main web application for a Fortune
10 company.A DNS lookup can fail, the user gets</p><p>3 0.96584719 <a title="1517-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-02-Piccolo_-_Building_Distributed_Programs_that_are_11x_Faster_than_Hadoop.html">983 high scalability-2011-02-02-Piccolo - Building Distributed Programs that are 11x Faster than Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Piccolo(notthisorthis) is a system for distributed computing, Piccolo is a new
data-centric programming model for writing parallel in-memory applications in
data centers. Unlike existing data-ﬂow models, Piccolo allows computation
running on different machines to share distributed, mutable state via a key-
value table interface. Traditional data-centric models (such as Hadoop) which
present the user a single object at a time to operate on, Piccolo exposes a
global table interface which is available to all parts of the computation
simultaneously. This allows users to specify programs in an intuitive manner
very similar to that of writing programs for a single machine.Using an in-
memory key-value store is a very different approach from the canonical map-
reduce, which is based on using distributed file systems. The results are
impressive:Experiments have shown that Piccolo is fast and pro-vides excellent
scaling for many applications. The performance of PageRank and k-means on

<p>Introduction: Pownce is a new social messaging application competing micromessage to
micromessage with the likes of Twitter and Jaiku. Still in closed beta, Pownce
has generously shared some of what they've learned so far. Like going to a
barrel tasting of a young wine and then tasting the same wine after some
aging, I think what will be really interesting is to follow Pownce and compare
the Pownce of today with the Pownce of tomorrow, after a few years spent in
the barrel. What lessons lie in wait for Pownce as they grow?Site:

<p>Introduction: Here's my template for describing the architecture of a system. The idea is to
have people fill out this template and that then becomes the basis for a
profile. This is how theFriends for Salepost was created and I think that
turned out well. People always want more detail, but realistically you can
only expect so much.The template is definitely too long, but it's more just a
series of questions to jog people's memories and then they can answer whatever
they think is important.What I want to ask is if you can think of any things
to add/delete/change in the template? What do you want to know about the
systems people are building? So if you have the time, please take a look and
tell me what you think.Getting to Know You* What is the name of your system
and where can we find out more about it?* What is your system is for?* Why did
you decide to build this system?* How is your project financed?* What is your
revenue model?* How do you market your product?* How long have you been

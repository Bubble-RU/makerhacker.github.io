[sent-16, score-0.523]
</p><p>2 This means if your job finishes in 2 hours 10 minutes, you are charged for the full three hours. [sent-19, score-0.334]
</p><p>3 This may not seem like a big deal, until you start running hundreds of jobs and the wasted time at the end of a job flow starts adding up. [sent-20, score-0.676]
</p><p>4 " Instead of shutting down a job flow at the end of a job,mrjobkeeps the flow alivein case another job wants to use it. [sent-22, score-0.85]
</p><p>5 If another job comes along that has similar cluster requirements,mrjobwillreuse the job flow. [sent-23, score-0.684]
</p><p>6 There are a few subtleties in implementing this: 1) what does it mean to have "similar cluster requirements", 2) how to avoid race conditions between multiple jobs, and 3) when is the cluster finally shut down? [sent-24, score-0.394]
</p><p>7 Similar job flows are defined meeting the criteria:Same Amazon Machine Image (AMI) versionSameHadoopversionSamemrjobversionSame bootstrap steps (bootstrap steps can setHadoopor cluster options)Same or greater RAM and Compute Units for each node type (eg. [sent-25, score-0.747]

</p><p>9 Jobs write to a specific S3 key with information about the job name and cluster type. [sent-28, score-0.358]
</p><p>10 Locks may timeout in the case of failures, which allow other jobs or the job terminator to reclaim the job flow. [sent-29, score-0.716]
</p><p>11 Job flow termination is handled by acronjob which runs every 5 minutes, checks for idle job flows that are about tohit their hourly charge, and terminates them. [sent-30, score-0.596]
</p><p>12 To further improveutilization of job flows, jobs can wait a predetermined amount of time to find a job flow it can re-use. [sent-32, score-0.844]
</p><p>13 For example, for development jobs,mrjobswilltry to find free job flows for 30 seconds before starting a new one. [sent-33, score-0.417]
</p><p>14 We estimate around a10% cost savings from using job flow pooling. [sent-35, score-0.48]
</p><p>15 In fact, we saw a side benefit: iterativedevelopment of jobs was sped up significantly since subsequent runs of a modifiedMapReducejob could reuse a cluster and the cluster startup time was eliminated. [sent-37, score-0.397]
</p><p>16 It analyzes usage ofEMRand recommends how many reserved instances to buy, as wellas generates some pretty graphs. [sent-54, score-0.481]
</p><p>17 It's important to note that reserved instance pricing is a billing construct. [sent-55, score-0.325]
</p><p>18 At the end of the month, Amazon simply looks at how many instance hours you've used and applies the reserved instance rates to any instances that were running, up to the number of instances purchased. [sent-57, score-0.717]
</p><p>19 EvaluatingROI: with some optimizations, cost evaluation is straightforward: how much would we have saved if we both reserved instances 2 months ago? [sent-82, score-0.434]

PlanForCloud.com.  I read a recent blog post about TripAdvisor's experiment
with AWS where they attempted to process 700K HTTP requests per minute on a
replica of their live site. There was also an interesting blog post on
Pinterest's massive growth on AWS. These blogs highlighted exactly the types
of questions we're interested in, mainly:How much would it cost to deploy
System X on Cloud Y? e.g. how much would it cost to host TripAdvisor on the
AWS US-East cloud?Would it be cheaper to use deployment option X or Y? e.g.
would it be cheaper to use reserved instances, different types of instances,
different cloud providers...What happens to costs when the system grows? e.g.
Pinterest has around 410TB of data on S3, what if that keeps growing at a rate
of 25% every month, like it has been in the last 10 months?I created a couple
of deployments in PlanForCloud to explore these questions and the results are

team this past summer. This post is introduced byAndy Gelfond, TripAdvisor's
head of engineering.It's been a little over a year since our last post about
theTripAdvisor architecture. It has been an exciting year. Our business and
team continues to grow, we are now an independent public company, and we have
continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown -
we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work
across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:56M visitors per
month350M+ pages requests a day120TB+ of warehouse data running on a large
Hadoop cluster, and quickly growingWe also had a very successful college

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: When EC2 first started the mental model was of a magic Pez dispenser supplying
an infinite stream of instances in any desired flavor. If you needed an
instance, because of a either a failure or traffic spike, it would be there.
As amazing as EC2 is, this model turned out to be optimistic.  From athread on
the Amazon discussion forum we learn any dispenser has limits:As Availability
Zones grow over time, our ability to continue to expand them can become
constrained. In these scenarios, we will prevent customers from launching in
the constrained zone if they do not yet have existing resources in that zone.
We also might remove the constrained zone entirely from the list of options
for new customers. This means that occasionally, different customers will see
a different number of Availability Zones in a particular Region. Both

<p>Introduction: I love it when a somewhat older article like Pinterest Cut Costs From $54 To
$20 Per Hour By Automatically Shutting Down Systems hits Hacker News and
generates agood conversation. One of the common sentiments about the cloud was
raised: why doesn't Pinterest save a lot of money by running their own
hardware instead of using the cloud?Ryan Park, Operations Engineer at
Pinterest, responds in what I think is the perfectmodern responseto that
ultimate existential design dilemma:Our #1 requirement has been to keep up
with the growth in traffic on the site. We've been growing so fast that
there's literally no way we could have ordered and racked equipment fast
enough. We were also a very small team -- a year ago there were only about a
dozen people in the whole company. At this point we're much larger, which
gives us room to consider more options like colo or multiple cloud
providers.AWS certainly feels pretty costly when you compare colo prices to
the list price for on-demand instances. But</p><p>5 0.81596112 <a title="1482-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-12-Pinterest_Cut_Costs_from_%2454_to_%2420_Per_Hour_by_Automatically_Shutting_Down_Systems.html">1371 high scalability-2012-12-12-Pinterest Cut Costs from $54 to $20 Per Hour by Automatically Shutting Down Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We've long known one of the virtues of the cloud is, through the magic of
services and automation, that systems can be shut or tuned down when not in
use. What may be surprising is how much money can be saved. This aspect of
cloudiness got a lot of pub atAWS re:Invent and is being rebranded under the
term Cost-Aware Architecture. Aninteresting examplewas given by Ryan Park,
Pinterest's technical operations lead:20% of their systems are shutdown after
hours in response to traffic loadsReserved instances are used for standard
traffic On-demand and spot instances are used to handle the elastic load
throughout the day. When more servers are needed for an auto-scaled service,
spot requests are opened and on-demand instances are started at the same time.
Most services are targeted to run at about 50% on-demand and 50% spot.Watchdog
processes continually check what's running. More instances are launched when
needed and terminated when not needed. If spot prices spike and spot instances
are sh</p><p>6 0.81313831 <a title="1482-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-19-Strategy%3A_Order_Two_Mediums_Instead_of_Two_Smalls_and_the_EC2_Buffet.html">812 high scalability-2010-04-19-Strategy: Order Two Mediums Instead of Two Smalls and the EC2 Buffet</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byYelp's JimBlomo. Jim manages a growing data mining team
that usesHadoop,mrjob, andoddjobto processTBsof data. Before Yelp, he built
infrastructure for startups and Amazon. Check out his upcoming talk
atOSCON2013 on Building a Cloud Culture at Yelp.In Q1 2013, Yelp had102
million unique visitors(source: Google Analytics) including approximately 10
million unique mobile devices using the Yelp app on a monthly average
basis.Yelpershavewritten more than39 million rich, local reviews, making Yelp
the leading local guide on everything from boutiques and mechanics to
restaurants and dentists. With respect to data, one of the most unique things
about Yelp is the variety of data: reviews, user profiles, business
descriptions, menus, check-ins, food photos... the list goes on.  We have many
ways to deal data, but today I'll focus on how we handle offline data

<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting
system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by
advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide
guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see
how!Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed
in a format calledAlexandrian form which draws on constructs used by
Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:The pattern
nameThe problem the pattern is trying to solveContextSolutionExamplesDesign
rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why
experts use itPatterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context,
and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new
context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next
‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied. A pattern language is a structured
collection of such patterns that build o</p><p>4 0.92154211 <a title="1482-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-17-WebSphere_Commerce_High_Availability_and_Performance_Configurations.html">321 high scalability-2008-05-17-WebSphere Commerce High Availability and Performance Configurations</a></p>

(which has a community edition) and backed up by a DB2 database.I guess you
all know about usopen.org so here's the story:breakWhile the re-emergence of
35-year-old Andre Agassi and the continued dominance of wunderkind Maria
Sharapova have highlighted the on-court headlines at this year's U.S. Open
Tennis Championships in Flushing Meadows, N.Y., IBM is hoping its new Power5
chip-based IT support for USOpen.org can make news among those more interested
in .NET than tennis nets.Big Blue has partnered with the U.S. Tennis
Association and the U.S. Open -- the most prestigious tennis tournament in the
U.S. -- since 1992. Together, they launched USOpen.org in 1995 so racket heads
could follow the matches online.The iSeries' role this year is in powering a

<p>Introduction: I’ve been a part of some late night release procedures and they’re never fun.
You’ve got QA, Dev, IT and a handful of managers sitting in their jammies in a
group IM (or worse, a conference call) from 2:00 AM until way too early in the
morning. Everyone’s grumpy and sleepy, causing the release to be more
difficult and take longer. Sometimes the dreaded “rollback!” is yelled. All
this because you’re running a high profile website that needs to be accessible
24/7, and 2:00 AM - 5:00 AM downtime is better than daytime downtime.If you're
a site that doesn't have 10s of thousands to drop on a real http load
balancer, use this strategy to release software during business hours with no
downtime using apache's mod_proxy_balancer....</p><p>3 0.11026911 <a title="1531-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-03-Some_Facebook_Secrets_to_Better_Operations.html">378 high scalability-2008-09-03-Some Facebook Secrets to Better Operations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kim Nash in aninterview with Jonathan Heiliger, Facebook VP of technical
operations, provides some juicy details on how Facebook handles operations.
Operations is one of those departments everyone runs differently as it is
usually anontogeny recapitulates phylogenysituation. With 2,000 databases, 25
terabytes of cache, 90 million active users, and 10,000 servers you know
Facebook has some serious operational issues. What are some of Facebook's
secrets to better operations?Frequent Releases. A major release once a week
and a minor releases every few days.Create a Cyber Liability Group. At one
time operations was distributed amongst several groups. A permanent operations
group was created to isolate problems and revert problem software components
back to previously known good states. The ability of a separate team to handle
rollbacks speaks to a great deal of standardization and advanced tool
building.Distribute Team Across Time Zones. Split the operations team across

<p>Introduction: At a Cloud Computing Meetup, Siddharth "Sid" Anand of Netflix, backed by a
merry band of Netflixians, gave an interesting talk:Keeping Movies Running
Amid Thunderstorms. While the talk gave a good overview of their move to the
cloud, issues with capacity planning,thundering herds, latency problems,
andsimian armageddon, I found myself most taken with how they handlesoftware
deployment in the cloud.I've worked on half a dozen or more build and
deployment systems, some small, some quite large, but never for a large
organization like Netflix in the cloud. The cloud has this amazing capability
that has never existed before that enables a novel approach to fault-tolerant
software deployments:the ability to spin up huge numbers of instances to
completely run a new release while running the old release at the same
time.The process goes something like: Acanary machineis launched first with
the new software load running real traffic to sanity test the load in a

<p>Introduction: This a guest post byRajkumar Iyer, a Member of Technical Staff at
Aerospike.About a year ago, Aerospike embarked upon a quest to increase in-
memory database performance - 1 Million TPS on a single inexpensive commodity
server. NoSQL has the reputation of speed, and we saw great benefit from
improving latency and throughput of cacheless architectures. At that time, we
took a version of Aerospike delivering about 200K TPS, improved a few things -
performance went to 500k TPS - and published the Aerospike 2.0 Community
Edition. We then used kernel tuning techniques and published therecipefor how
we achieved 1 M TPS on $5k of hardware.This year we continued the quest. Our
goal was to achieve 1 Million database transactions per second per server;
more than doubling previous performance. This compares to Cassandra's boast of
1M TPS on over 300 servers in Google Compute Engine - at a cost of $2 million
dollars per year. Weachieved thiswithout kernel tuning. This article describes

<p>Introduction: This is guest post byMichael DeHaan(@laserllama), a software developer and
architect, on Ansible, a simple deployment, model-driven configuration
management, and command execution framework.I owe High Scalability a great
deal of credit for the idea behind my latest software project. I was reading
about how an older tool I helped create, Func, was used atTumblr, and it
kicked some ideas into gear. This article is about what happened from that
idea.My observation, which the article reinforced, was that many shops end up
using a configuration management tool (Puppet, Chef, cfengine), a separate
deployment tool (Capistrano, Fabric) and yet another separate ad-hoc task
execution tool (Func, pssh, etc) because one class of tool historically hasn't
been good at all three jobs.My other observation (not from the article) was
that the whole "infrastructure as code" movement, while revolutionary, and
definitely great for many, was probably secretly grating on a good number of
systems administrato</p><p>3 0.75568688 <a title="1531-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-02-Product%3A_Supervisor_-__Monitor_and_Control_Your_Processes.html">295 high scalability-2008-04-02-Product: Supervisor -  Monitor and Control Your Processes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a sad fact of life, but processes die. I know, it's horrible. You start
them, send them out into process space, and hope for the best. Yet sometimes,
despite your best coding, they core dump, seg fault, or some other calamity
befalls them. Unlike our messy biological world so cruelly ruled by entropy,
in the digital world processes can be given another chance. They can be
restarted. A greater destiny awaits. And hopefully this time the random
lottery of unforeseen killing factors will be avoided and a long productive
life will be had by all.This is fun code to write because it's a lot more
complicated than you might think. And restarting processes is a highly
effective high availability strategy. Most faults are transient, caused by an
unexpected series of events. Rather than taking drastic action, like taking a
node out of production or failing over, transients can be effectively masked
by simply restarting failed processes. Though complexity makes it a fun
problem, it's also why</p><p>4 0.72603041 <a title="1531-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-25-Product%3A_Puppet_the_Automated_Administration_System.html">429 high scalability-2008-10-25-Product: Puppet the Automated Administration System</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:Digg on their choice and use of Puppet. They chose puppet over
cfengine, and bcfg2 because they liked Puppet's resource abstraction layer
(RAL), the ability to implement configuration management incrementally,
support for bundles, and the overall design philosophy.Puppetimplements a
declarative (what not how) configuration language for automating common
administration tasks. It's the system every large site writes for themselves
and it's already made for you! Ilike was able to "easily" scale from0 to
hundreds of serversusing Puppet. I can't believe I've never seen this before.
It looks really cool. What is Puppet and how can it help you scale your
website operations?breakFrom the Puppet website:Puppet has been developed to
help the sysadmin community move to building and sharing mature tools that
avoid the duplication of everyone solving the same problem. It does so in two

<p>Introduction: At37 SignalsJoshua Sierles describes how 37 Signals usesSprinkleto configure
their servers within EC2. Sprinkledefines a domain specific meta-language for
describing and processing the installation of software. You can find an
interesting discussion of Sprinkle's creation story by the creator himself,
Marcus Crafter, inSprinkle Some Powder!.Marcus divides provisioning tools into
two categories:Task Based- the tool issues a list of commands to run on the
remote system, either remotely via a network connection or smart
client.Policy/state Based- the tool determines what needs to be run on the
remote system by examining its current and final state.Sprinkle combines both
models together in a chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter approach using normal Ruby
code as the DSL (domain specific language) to declaratively describe remote
system configurations. 37 Signals likes the use of Ruby as the DSL because it
makes learning a separate syntax unnecessary. I've successfully done similar
things in Perl.</p><p>6 0.71982831 <a title="1531-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-09-Vagrant_-_Build_and_Deploy_Virtualized_Development_Environments_Using_Ruby.html">807 high scalability-2010-04-09-Vagrant - Build and Deploy Virtualized Development Environments Using Ruby</a></p>

Theorem: A Proposed Theorem for the Trade-offs in Horizontally Scalable Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Successful software design is all about trade-offs. In the typical (if there
is such a thing) distributed system, recognizing the importance of trade-offs
within the design of your architecture is integral to the success of your
system. Despite this reality, I see time and time again, developers choosing a
particular solution based on an ill-placed belief in their solution as a
“silver bullet”, or a solution that conquers all, despite the inevitable
occurrence of changing requirements. Regardless of the reasons behind this
phenomenon, I’d like to outline a few of the methods I use to ensure that I’m
making good scalable decisions without losing sight of the trade-offs that
accompany them. I’d also like to compile (pun intended) the issues at hand, by
formulating a simple theorem that we can use to describe this oft occurring
situation.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.91908509 <a title="1531-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-13-AIDA%3A_Badoo%E2%80%99s_journey_into_Continuous_Integration.html">1531 high scalability-2013-10-13-AIDA: Badoo’s journey into Continuous Integration</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's hardly news to anyone that product development and testing involve a lot
of boring routine work, which can lead to human error. To avoid complications
stemming from this, we use AIDA.AIDA(Automated Interactive Deploy Assistant)
is a utility that automatically performs many of the processes in Git,
TeamCity and JIRA.In this post, we focus on how through using AIDA we were
able to automate multiple workflows and create a scheme of continuous
integration.We'll start by looking at the version control system (VCS) we use
here at Badoo, specifically how Git is used to automate creation of release
branches, and their subsequent merging. Then we'll discuss AIDA's major
contribution to both JIRA integration and TeamCity.Git flowThe Badoo Team uses
Git as a version control system. Our model ensures each task is developed and
tested in a separate branch. The branch name consists of the ticket number in
JIRA and a description of the problem.BFG-

<p>Introduction: In It's Time for Low Latency  Stephen Rumble et al. explore the idea that it's
time to rearchitect our stack to live in the modern era of low-latency
datacenter instead of high-latency WANs. The implications for
programarchitectures will be revolutionary.  Luiz Andre Barroso, Distinguished
Engineer at Google, sees ultra low latency as a way to make computer
resources, to be as much as possible, fungible, that is they are
interchangeable and location independent, effectively turning a datacenter
into single computer. Abstract from the paper:The operating systems community
has ignored network latency for too long. In the past, speed-of-light delays
in wide area networks and unoptimized network hardware have made sub-100µs
round-trip times impossible. However, in the next few years datacenters will
be deployed with low-latency Ethernet. Without the burden of propagation
delays in the datacenter campus and network delays in the Ethernet devices, it
will be up to us to ﬁnish the job and see</p><p>6 0.90353823 <a title="1531-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-21-Hot_Holiday_Scalability_Links_for_2009.html">753 high scalability-2009-12-21-Hot Holiday Scalability Links for 2009</a></p>

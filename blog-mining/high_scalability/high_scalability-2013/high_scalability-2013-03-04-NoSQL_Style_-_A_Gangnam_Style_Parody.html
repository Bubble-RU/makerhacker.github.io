case you aren't sure what I'm talking about, Jurgen Appelo goes through this
massive effort ofranking blogsaccording to Google PageRank, Technorati
Authority, Alexa Rank, Google links, and Twitter Grader Rank.Through some
obviously mistaken calculations HighScalability comes out #3. Given all the
superb competition I'm not exactly sure how that can be. Well, thanks for all
the excellent people who contribute and all the even more excellent people

<p>Introduction: InSecrets to Lightning Fast Mobile Design, Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger
shares three strategies Instagram uses to outsmart high latency mobile
networks and make mobile apps feel faster than they really are, which helped
Instagram reach 12 million users in 12 months:The motivation:"mobile
experiences fill gaps while we wait. no one wants to wait while they
wait"Perform actions optimistically. Make the user feel productive. Likes,
comments, and follows are registered on screen while the like operation is
being sent in the background. Adaptively preload content. Load content before
it's needed. Don't images according to time, it will take too long, instead
re-prioritize based on interest. Show what the social network things is the
most popular. Listen to what your user's flicks and taps are telling you.Move
bits when no-one is watching.Picture uploading startsbeforeyou share them,
most apps wait until after the share screen. The rule is send data as soon as
it's ready, then match it</p><p>5 0.049440008 <a title="1416-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-14-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_14th%2C_2014.html">1612 high scalability-2014-03-14-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 14th, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update: Benjamin Black said he was the source of the quote and also said I was
wrong about what he meant. His real point:The meaning of the statement was
that NoSQL systems (really the various map-reduce systems) are lacking a
standard model for describing and querying and that developing one should be a
high priority task for them.At the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto, an audience
member, sorry, I couldn't tell who, said something I found really
interesting:NoSQL took away the relational model and gave nothing back.The
idea being that NoSQL has focussed on ease of use, scalability, performance,
etc, but it has lost the idea of how data relates to other data. True to its
name, the relational model is very good at capturing a managing relationships.
With NoSQL all relationships have been pushed back onto the poor programmer to
implement in code rather than the database managing it. We've sacrificed
usability. NoSQL is about concurrency, latency, and scalability, but it's not
about data.My</p><p>4 0.45608386 <a title="1416-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-29-One_Story_of_Life_as_Told_Through_Queues.html">1556 high scalability-2013-11-29-One Story of Life as Told Through Queues</a></p>

Grigorik. This happens so often to me shopping at Costco or making lane
changes on the highway or picking stocks. Sometimes it's just never the right

<p>Introduction: Robert Stewart shared this useful Ajax related scalability strategy:We avoided
XMLHttpRequests for individual keystrokes, choosing to go back to the server
only when a field lost focus. Google can afford all the servers to handle the
load for that, but we didn't want to.Do you have a scalability strategy to
share? Thenshare it!.</p><p>4 0.27958408 <a title="1416-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-06-Announce%3A_First_Meeting_of_Boston_Scalability_User_Group.html">268 high scalability-2008-03-06-Announce: First Meeting of Boston Scalability User Group</a></p>

meeting!The site is at: http://www.bostonsug.org/</p><p>5 0.2776497 <a title="1416-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-28-DR-BC_for_web-DB_servers.html">226 high scalability-2008-01-28-DR-BC for web-DB servers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: All,I'm looking for a faster/reliable solution for DR/BC as well as for
sclability for my web/db servers. I came across VMWare Infrastructure and
other products. The I/O performance concerns me to go with virtual servers.
I'm also looking into imaging software such as Acrnois.Could anyone share
their thoughts on how it's being done with bigger names such as google/youtube
etc..?Thank you,Regards,Janakan Rajendran.</p><p>6 0.27151626 <a title="1416-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-19-UK_Based_CDN.html">324 high scalability-2008-05-19-UK Based CDN</a></p>

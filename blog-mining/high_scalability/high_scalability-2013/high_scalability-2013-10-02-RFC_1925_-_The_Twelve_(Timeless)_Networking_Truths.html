<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectives  is a series of posts that highlights the ideas that will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires an open mind.     Van Jacobson    Van Jacobson is a Research Fellow at   PARC  . Prior to that he was Chief Scientist and co-founder of Packet Design. Prior to that he was Chief Scientist at Cisco. Prior to that he was head of the Network Research group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He's been studying networking since 1969. He still hopes that someday something will start to make sense.    Scaling the Internet – Does the Net needs an upgrade?

<p>Introduction: Google has released an epic second edition of their ground breaking  The Datacenter as a Computer  book. It's called an introduction, but at 156 pages I would love to see what the Advanced version would look like!
 
John Fries in a  G+ comment  has what I think is a perfect summary of the ultimate sense of the book:
  

It's funny, when I was at Google I was initially quite intimidated by interacting with an enormous datacenter, and then I started imagining the entire datacenter was shrunk down into a small box sitting on my desk, and realized it was just another machine and the physical size didn't matter anymore

  
It's such a far ranging book that it's impossible to characterize simply. It covers an amazing diversity of topics, from an introduction to warehouse-scale computing; workloads and software infrastructure; hardware; datacenter architecture; energy and power efficiency; cost structures; how to deal with failures and repairs; and it closes with a discussion of key challenge</p><p>4 0.077349119 <a title="1526-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-13-Why_are_Facebook%2C_Digg%2C_and_Twitter_so_hard_to_scale%3F.html">721 high scalability-2009-10-13-Why are Facebook, Digg, and Twitter so hard to scale?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Real-time social graphs (connectivity between people, places, and things). That's why scaling Facebook is hard  says Jeff Rothschild , Vice President of Technology at Facebook. Social networking sites like Facebook, Digg, and Twitter are simply harder than traditional websites to scale. Why is that? Why would social networking sites be any more difficult to scale than traditional web sites? Let's find out.
 
Traditional websites are easier to scale than social networking sites for two reasons:
  
 They usually access only their own data and common cached data. 
 Only 1-2% of users are active on the site at one time. 
  
Imagine a huge site like Yahoo. When you come to Yahoo they can get your profile record with one get and that's enough to build your view of the website for you. It's relatively straightforward to scale systems based around single records using  distributed hashing schemes . And since only a few percent of the people are on the site at once it takes comparatively little</p><p>5 0.071895093 <a title="1526-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-14-Virtualization_and_Cloud_Computing_is_Changing_the_Network_to_East-West_Routing.html">1157 high scalability-2011-12-14-Virtualization and Cloud Computing is Changing the Network to East-West Routing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It’s  called “east-west” networking, which when compared to its predecessor,  “north-south” networking, evinces images of maelstroms and hurricane  winds and tsunamis for some reason. It could be the subtle correlation  between the transformative shift this change in networking patterns has  on the data center with that of El Niño’s transformative power upon the  weather patterns across the globe.
  

    Traditionally,  data center networks have focused on North-South network traffic. The  assumption is that clients on the edge would mainly communicate with  servers at the core, rather than across the network to other clients. 


 But  server virtualization changes all this, with servers, virtual  appliances and even virtual desktops scattered across the same physical  infrastructure. These environments are also highly dynamic, with  workloads moving to different physical locations on the network as  virtual servers are migrated (in the case of data center networks) and  clients move</p><p>6 0.068715997 <a title="1526-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: What will the version of the Internet that follows us to the stars look like? Yes, people are really thinking seriously about this sort of thing. Specifically the  InterPlanetary Networking Special Interest Group  (IPNSIG).
 
 
 
 Ansible-like  faster-than-light communication it isn't. There's no magical warp drive. Nor is a network of telepaths acting as a 'verse spanning telegraph system.
 
It's more mundane than that. And in many ways more interesting as it's sort of like the old Internet on steroids, the one that was based on on UUCP and dial-up connections, but over vastly longer distances and with much  longer delays :
  

The Interplanetary Internet (based on IPN, also called InterPlaNet) is a conceived computer network in space, consisting of a set of network nodes which can communicate with each other.[1][2] Communication would be greatly delayed by the great interplanetary distances, so the IPN needs a new set of protocols and technology that are tolerant to large delays and</p><p>3 0.83741349 <a title="1526-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-10-Kill_the_Telcos_Save_the_Internet_-_The_Unsocial_Network.html">1140 high scalability-2011-11-10-Kill the Telcos Save the Internet - The Unsocial Network</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone is killing the Internet. Since you probably use the Internet everyday you might find this surprising. It almost sounds silly, and the reason is technical, but our crack team of networking experts has examined the patient and made the diagnosis. What did they find?
  
  Diagnostic team : the  Packet Pushers  gang ( Greg Ferro ,  Jan Zorz ,  Ivan Pepelnjak ) in the podcast  How We Are Killing the Internet .  
  Diagnosis : invasive tunnelation. ( tubes anyone? ) 
  Prognosis : even Dr. House might not be able to help. 
  Cure : go back to what the Internet was; kill the tunnels; route IPv4 and IPv6; have public addresses on everything; disrupt the telcos. 
  
This is a classic story in a strange setting--the network--but the themes are universal: centralization vs. decentralization (that's where the telcos obviously come in), good vs. evil, order vs. disorder, tyranny vs. freedom, change vs. stasis, simplicity vs. complexity.

<p>Introduction: The story of driving the  golden spike  to symbolize the completion of the  transcontinental railroad  is famous in the US. What is not so well known is the story of how it also foreshadowed changes to come as an early version of both the Internet and the Internet of Things. But that was 1869, how can that possibly be?
  Telegraph as Internet  
First, let's establish the telegraph and cable systems was an early version of an Internet.
 
As railroad tracks were being laid a  transcontental telegraph  system was also being constructed. Telegraph lines were installed parallel to the tracks making instant communication available across the continent, faster than any horse could ride.
 
With the  transalantic cable system  information could quickly span continents in minutes:
  

The miles of American telegraph grew from 40 in 1846 to 12,000 in 1850 to 23,000 in 1852. In Europe it increased from 2,000 in 1849 to 110,000 in 1869. The cost of sending 10 words was $1.55 in 1850, $1 in 1870, 40</p><p>5 0.81348127 <a title="1526-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-18-Scalability_Perspectives_%232%3A_Van_Jacobson_%E2%80%93_Content-Centric_Networking.html">446 high scalability-2008-11-18-Scalability Perspectives #2: Van Jacobson – Content-Centric Networking</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The paper  MegaPipe: A New Programming Interface for Scalable Network I/O  ( video ,  slides ) hits the common theme that if you want to go faster you need a better car design, not just a better driver. So that's why the authors started with a clean-slate and designed a network API from the ground up with support for concurrent I/O, a requirement for achieving high performance while scaling to large numbers of connections per thread, multiple cores, etc.  What they created is MegaPipe, "a new network programming API for message-oriented workloads to avoid the performance issues of BSD Socket API."
 
The result: MegaPipe outperforms baseline Linux between  29% (for long connections)  and  582% (for short connections) . MegaPipe improves the performance of a modiﬁed version of  memcached between 15% and 320% . For a workload based on real-world HTTP traces, MegaPipe boosts the throughput of  nginx by 75% .

<p>Introduction: An excellent article by Bryan Cantrill and Jeff Bonwick on how to write multi-threaded code. With more processors and no magic bullet solution for how to use them, knowing how to write multiprocessor code that doesn't screw up your system is still a valuable skill. Some topics:
   Know your cold paths from your hot paths.    Intuition is frequently wrong—be data intensive.    Know when—and when not—to break up a lock.     Be wary of readers/writer locks.   Consider per-CPU locking.   Know when to broadcast—and when to signal.    Learn to debug postmortem.   Design your systems to be composable.    Don't use a semaphore where a mutex would suffice.   Consider memory retiring to implement per-chain hash-table locks.    Be aware of false sharing.   Consider using nonblocking synchronization routines to monitor contention.   When reacquiring locks, consider using generation counts to detect state change.   Use wait- and lock-free structures only if you absolutely must.

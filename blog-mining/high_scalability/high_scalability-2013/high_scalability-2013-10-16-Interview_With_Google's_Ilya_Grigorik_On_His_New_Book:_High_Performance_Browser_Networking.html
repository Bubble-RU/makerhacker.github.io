</p><p>2 Reading the book I was struck by what a complicated beast or little World Wide Web has become. [sent-13, score-0.427]
</p><p>3 The book reads a little like that imagined diagram. [sent-20, score-0.426]
</p><p>4 If you wonder why people are always going on about latency then this chapter is for you. [sent-22, score-0.268]
</p><p>5 The chapter on Mobile Networks is really good, it fills in a lot of details in an excessively complicated space. [sent-23, score-0.268]
</p><p>6 And the WebRTC chapter has an amazing amount of detail on an exciting new browser capability. [sent-27, score-0.376]
</p><p>7 Almost every chapter has solid practical advice like this on how to make the web faster for your application. [sent-39, score-0.423]
</p><p>8 I'm a web performance engineer and developer advocate at Google. [sent-43, score-0.22]
</p><p>9 My primary focus is on the network side of things: optimizing protocols, content delivery, server and client networking performance, and just about everything in between. [sent-44, score-0.324]
</p><p>10 As a result, the web browser is the most widespread deployment platform available to developers today - we're talking billions of devices and users around the world! [sent-48, score-0.371]
</p><p>11 The goal of my book is to lay the foundation for how to build high performance, connected applications in the browser: network protocol optimization, performance best practices, common gotchas, and so on. [sent-49, score-0.448]
</p><p>12 I think most developers still don't appreciate the importance and limitations of latency on web performance. [sent-63, score-0.348]
</p><p>13 Once you convince yourself that latency is indeed the problem, then your entire outlook changes, and you'll quickly begin to recognize problems and optimization opportunities everywhere you look: optimizing underlying transport protocols (TCP, TLS, etc. [sent-66, score-0.473]
</p><p>14 In my book, I've tried to approach the subject both from the "how" and the "why" perspectives: first, explain how the underlying protocols work and their limitations and then focus on practical advice for optimizing each one. [sent-69, score-0.47]
</p><p>15 The book starts with the nuts and bolts of TCP, TLS, and UDP, then dives into how the mobile radio and carrier networks work under the hood, and then works "its way up" through HTTP, XHR, WebSocket, and WebRTC. [sent-70, score-0.519]
</p><p>16 I wrote HPBN with the goal of providing the best go-to resource for learning about and optimizing networking performance. [sent-107, score-0.213]
</p><p>17 Getting the book in front of people working on these problems (both implementors and web developers) was key to finding the right mix of practical "how" and "why". [sent-118, score-0.582]
</p><p>18 By the way, the book is still and will continue to be availableonline and free(but you're more than welcome to buy a copy also :-)). [sent-119, score-0.359]
</p><p>19 Well, first, I've learned a lot about web performance -- working on HPBN forced me to clarify a lot of important details I've overlooked before, relearn topics I thought I understood but really didn't, and so on. [sent-130, score-0.277]
</p><p>20 Turns out, I've spent just north of 1000 hours working on the book (Itracked all of my timevia RescueTime, plus old-fashioned paper and pen logging). [sent-133, score-0.359]

<p>Introduction: Performance is critical to the success of any web site, and yet today's web
applications push browsers to their limits with increasing amounts of rich
content and heavy use of Ajax. In his new bookEven Faster Web Sites:
Performance Best Practices for Web Developers, Steve Souders, web performance
evangelist at Google and former Chief Performance Yahoo!, provides valuable
techniques to help you optimize your site's performance.Souders' previous
book, the bestsellingHigh Performance Web Sites, shocked the web development
world by revealing that 80% of the time it takes for a web page to load is on
the client side. In Even Faster Web Sites, Souders and eight expert
contributors provide best practices and pragmatic advice for improving your
site's performance in three critical categories:JavaScript- Get advice for

Cooperation at Flickr. Insightful talk. Some highlights: Change is good if you
can build tools and culture to lower the risk of change. Operations and
developers need to become of one mind and respect each other. An automated
infrastructure is the one tool you need most. Common source control. One step
build. One step deploy. Don't be a pussy, deploy. Always ship trunk. Feature
flags - don't branch code, make features runtime configurable in code. Dark
launch - release data paths early without UI component. Shared metrics.
Adaptive feedback to prioritize important features. IRC for communication for
human context. Best solutions occur when dev and op work together and trust
each other. Trust is earned by helping each other solve their problems. Look
at what new features imply for operations, what can go wrong, and how to
recover. Provide knobs and levers to help operations. Devs should have access

<p>Introduction: It seems that HTTP calls have become a default way to think about distributed
systems. HTTP and Web services definitely have a lot to offer, but they are
not the only way to do things and there are definitely cases where web is not
the right choice. Unfortunately, lots of people just stick with web services
and hack on, trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. In cases such as
these, a different distribution paradigm can save us quite a lot of time and
effort both in development and later in maintenance. One of those different
paradigms is messaging.</p><p>4 0.75446481 <a title="1533-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-09-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_9%2C_2013.html">1499 high scalability-2013-08-09-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 9, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: John McCutchan,after a long career spent working on the Linux kernel and being
hired out as a code optimization guru, joined Google's Dart team. A curious
hire until you watch Bringing SIMD to the Web via Dart, where John makes a
programmer accessible explanation of why he likes Dart: performance,
performance, performance.Dartis an open-source Web programming
languagedeveloped by Google. The motivation for Dart is twofold: provide a
language capable of scaling up to the complex web applications that are
becoming the norm. Think Gmail. And provide a single language capable of
working on both the client and server. Towards those ends Dart is a complete
language, full tool environment, and provides an advanced Web UI framework for
building web applications at a high level of abstraction.Why isn't JavaScript
good enough? The fear is for large web apps the nature of JavaScript puts
crippling limits on potential performance improvements, which will cause web
apps to lose out to mobile apps.</p><p>6 0.74780011 <a title="1533-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-12-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_12%2C_2013.html">1490 high scalability-2013-07-12-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 12, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Google has released an epic second edition of their ground breaking The
Datacenter as a Computer book. It's called an introduction, but at 156 pages I
would love to see what the Advanced version would look like!John Fries in aG+
commenthas what I think is a perfect summary of the ultimate sense of the
book:It's funny, when I was at Google I was initially quite intimidated by
interacting with an enormous datacenter, and then I started imagining the
entire datacenter was shrunk down into a small box sitting on my desk, and
realized it was just another machine and the physical size didn't matter
anymoreIt's such a far ranging book that it's impossible to characterize
simply. It covers an amazing diversity of topics, from an introduction to
warehouse-scale computing; workloads and software infrastructure; hardware;
datacenter architecture; energy and power efficiency; cost structures; how to
deal with failures and repairs; and it closes with a discussion of key
challenges, which include ra</p><p>2 0.92171699 <a title="1533-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-17-Ringo_-_Distributed_key-value_storage_for_immutable_data.html">468 high scalability-2008-12-17-Ringo - Distributed key-value storage for immutable data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ringo is an experimental, distributed, replicating key-value store based on
consistent hashing and immutable data. Unlike many general-purpose databases,
Ringo is designed for a specific use case: For archiving small (less than 4KB)
or medium-size data items (<100MB) in real-time so that the data can survive K
- 1 disk breaks, where K is the desired number of replicas, without any
downtime, in a manner that scales to terabytes of data. In addition to
storing, Ringo should be able to retrieve individual or small sets of data
items with low latencies (<10ms) and provide a convenient on-disk format for
bulk data access.Ringo is compatible with themap-reduce framework Discoand it

<p>Introduction: If you are Google you don't just complain about performance on the web, you do
something about it. Doing something about web performance is the job of one
Ilya Grigorik, Developer Advocate,Make the Web Fastat Google, and author of a
great new book:High Performance Browser Networking: What every web developer
should know about networking and web performance. That's a big topic you might
be saying to yourself. And it is. The book is 400 plus information packed
pages. But never fear. Ilya writes in a very straightforward style. It's like
a man page for the web. Which is a good thing.In case you are not familiar
with Ilya, he's the perfect choice for writing such an ambitious book. For
years Ilya has been producing excellent content onhis blog and if yousearch
YouTube you'll find presentation after presentation on the topics found in the
book. Authority established.Reading the book I was struck by what a

graphs showing Amazon is hard to beat for small machines and become less cost
efficient for well used larger machines. Long term storage costs may eat your

<p>Introduction: A lot has happened since my first article on the Stack Overflow Architecture.
Contrary to the theme of that last article, which lavished attention on Stack
Overflow's dedication to a scale-up strategy, Stack Overflow has both grown up
and out in the last few years.Stack Overflow has grown up by more then
doubling in size to over 16 million users and multiplying its number of page
views nearly 6 times to 95 million page views a month.  Stack Overflow has
grown out by expanding into theStack Exchange Network, which includes Stack
Overflow, Server Fault, and Super User for a grand total of 43 different
sites. That's a lot of fruitful multiplying going on.What hasn't changed is
Stack Overflow's openness about what they are doing. And that's what prompted
this update. A recent series of posts talks a lot about how they've been
handling their growth: Stack Exchange's Architecture in Bullet Points, Stack
Overflow's New York Data Center, Designing For Scalability of Management and

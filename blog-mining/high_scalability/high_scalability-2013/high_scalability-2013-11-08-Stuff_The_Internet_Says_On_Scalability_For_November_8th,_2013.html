<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.   Let's take a short trip down web architecture lane:
  It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl scripts and a SQL database   It's 1995: Scale-up the database.   It's 1998: LAMP   It's 1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SAN   It's 2001: In-memory data-grid.   It's 2003: Add a caching layer.   It's 2004: Add scale-out and partitioning.   It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a distributed file system.   It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.   It's 2008: C</p><p>4 0.14059895 <a title="1545-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

  $1.5 billion : The cost of cutting London-Toyko latency by 60ms;  9 days : It took AOL 9 years to hit 1 million users. Facebook 9 months. Draw Something 9 days;   ~362 sq ft solar array : powers 1 sq ft of data center. 
 Is Amazon is trying to margenalize OpenStack by  partnering with Eucalyptus ? 
 As the DevOps turns. You won't see this on TMZ.  Adrian Cockcroft :  There is no central control, the teams do it for themselves in the cloud;  John Allspaw : s/NoOps/OpsDoneMaturelyButStillOps/g;  Edward Capriolo : Trust developers not. Good thing is we all agree DevOps is necessary, the differences are in the how and whom. 
 In a word (or two), Wordnik has  gone cloud . Gone is their big iron, in are envious EC2 instances. Driving the move was HA in multi-datacenters, elasticity for traffic bursts, and incremental cluster upgrades. There has been almost no reduction in performance.

<p>Introduction: I am in no way a music expert, but when I listen to  Symphony No. 4  by  Charles Ives , I imagine it's what a complex software/hardware system might sound like if we could hear its inner workings. Ives uses a lot of riotously competing rhythms in this work. It can sound discordant, yet the effect is deeply layered and eventually harmonious, just like the systems we use, create, and become part of.
 
I was pointed to this piece by someone who said there were two conductors. I'd never heard of such a thing! So I was intrigued. The first version of the performance sounds and looks great, but it unfortunately does not use two conductors. The second version uses two conductors, but is unfortunately just a snippet.
 
It's strikingly odd to see two conductors, but I imagine different parts of our systems using different conductors too, running at different rhythms, sometimes slow, sometimes fast, sometimes there are outbursts, sometimes in vicious conflict. Yet conceptually it all stills seem</p><p>same-blog 2 0.86140668 <a title="1545-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-08-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_November_8th%2C_2013.html">1545 high scalability-2013-11-08-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For November 8th, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jesper Söderlund not only put together a few interesting  scalability patterns , he also came up with a few interesting  scalability lessons :
  
  Lesson #1 . Put Smarty compile and template caches on an active-active DRBD cluster with high load and your servers will DIE! 
  Lesson #2 . Don't use out-of-the-box configurations. 
  Lesson #3 . Single points of contention will eventually become a bottleneck. 
  Lesson #4 . Plan in advance.  
  Lesson #5 . Offload your databases as much as possible. 
  Lesson #6 . File systems matter and can run out of space / inodes.

<p>Introduction: Amazon is fixing two of their major problems: no static IP addresses and single datacenter operation. By adding these two new features developers can finally build a no apology system on Amazon. Before you always had to throw in an apology or two. No, we don't have low failover times because of the silly DNS games and unexceptionable DNS update and propagation times and no, we don't operate in more than one datacenter. No more. Now Amazon is adding   Elastic IP Addresses   and   Availability Zones  .     Elastic IP addresses are far better than normal IP addresses because they are both in tight with   Jessica Alba   and they are:        Static IP addresses designed for dynamic cloud computing. An Elastic IP address is associated with your account, not a particular instance, and you control that address until you choose to explicitly release it. Unlike traditional static IP addresses, however, Elastic IP addresses allow you to mask instance or availability zone failures by programmatica</p><p>6 0.80021214 <a title="1545-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-09-04-Changing_Architectures%3A_New_Datacenter_Networks_Will_Set_Your_Code_and_Data_Free___.html">1316 high scalability-2012-09-04-Changing Architectures: New Datacenter Networks Will Set Your Code and Data Free   </a></p>

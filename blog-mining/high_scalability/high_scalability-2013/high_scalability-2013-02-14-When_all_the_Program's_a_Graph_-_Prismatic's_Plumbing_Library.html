</p><p>5 We learned how Prismatic, an interest driven content suggestion service, builds programs in terms of graph stuff:     As you might expect, they are doing things a little differently. [sent-6, score-0.543]
</p><p>6 They’ve chosen Clojure, a modern Lisp that compiles to Java bytecode, as their programming language of choice. [sent-7, score-0.165]
</p><p>7 The idea is to use functional programming to build fine-grained, flexible abstractions that are composed to express problem-specific logic. [sent-8, score-0.441]
</p><p>8 One example of functional power is their graph library, which they use all over the place. [sent-9, score-0.647]
</p><p>9 For example, a graph of computations can be described to create the equivalent of a low-latency, pipelined set of map-reduce jobs for each user. [sent-10, score-0.627]
</p><p>10 Another example is the use of subgraphs to compactly describe service configuration in a modular way. [sent-11, score-0.352]
</p><p>11 Another example is that their doc-analysis pipeline is a graph, where each elaboration of a document may depend on the previous (e. [sent-12, score-0.452]
</p><p>12 , identifying topics for a document depends on having already extracted its text); the newsfeed generation process is a graph composed of many query and ranking steps; and each of the production services is itself a graph, where each resource (e. [sent-14, score-0.872]
</p><p>13 data store, memory index, HTTP handler, and so on) is a node that can depend on others. [sent-16, score-0.194]
</p><p>14 Prismatic describes Graph thusly:   Last week, we open-sourced Graph as part of our plumbing library. [sent-17, score-0.205]
</p><p>15 Graph is a very simple, declarative way to describe how data flows between functions in an FP program. [sent-18, score-0.261]
</p><p>16 It allows us to formalize the informal structure of good FP code, and enables higher-order abstractions over these structures that can help stamp out many persistent forms of complexity overhead. [sent-19, score-0.318]
</p><p>17 Concretely, a Graph represents the structured composition of any number of functions, using a Clojure map. [sent-20, score-0.149]
</p><p>18 Each entry in a Graph is a mapping from a node name (keyword) to a keyword function, which computes the value of its node from the values of other nodes and inputs from outside the Graph. [sent-21, score-0.397]
</p><p>19 The plumbing readme provides some simple examples of what Graph can do, and this test goes into more gory details on how to use Graph. [sent-22, score-0.367]
</p><p>20 Perhaps seeing Prismatic's example as a successful deployment of these ideas in production will help us all jump out of the same old stuff. [sent-26, score-0.263]

<p>Introduction: This post on  Prismatic ’s Architecture is adapted from an email conversation with Prismatic programmer  Jason Wolfe  .  What should you read on the web today? Any thoroughly modern person must solve this dilemma every day, usually using some occult process to divine what’s important in their many feeds: Twitter, RSS, Facebook, Pinterest, G+, email, Techmeme, and an uncountable numbers of other information sources.  Jason Wolfe from Prismatic has generously agreed to describe their thoroughly modern solution for answering the “what to read question” using lots of sexy words like Machine Learning, Social Graphs, BigData, functional programming, and in-memory real-time feed processing. The result is possibly even more occult, but this or something very much like it will be how we meet the challenge of finding interesting topics and stories hidden inside infinitely deep pools of information.  A couple of things stand out about Prismatic.

<p>Introduction: Update:   Social networks in the database: using a graph database . A nice post on representing, traversing, and performing other common social network operations using a graph database.  If you are  Digg  or  LinkedIn  you can build your own speedy graph database to represent your complex social network relationships. For those of more modest means  Neo4j , a graph database, is a good alternative.  A graph is a collection nodes (things) and edges (relationships) that connect pairs of nodes. Slap properties (key-value pairs) on nodes and relationships and you have a surprisingly powerful way to represent most anything you can think of. In a graph database "relationships are first-class citizens. They connect two nodes and both nodes and relationships can hold an arbitrary amount of key-value pairs. So you can look at a graph database as a key-value store, with full support for relationships."

<p>Introduction: GraphChi  uses a  Parallel Sliding Windows  method which can: process a graph with mutable edge values efficiently from disk, with only a small number of non-sequential disk accesses, while supporting the asynchronous model of computation.
 
 
 
The result is graphs with billions of edges can be processed on just a single machine. It uses a vertex-centric computation model similar to  Pregel , which supports iterative algorithims as apposed to the batch style of MapReduce.  Streaming graph updates  are supported.
 
About GraphChi, Carlos Guestrin, codirector of Carnegie Mellon's Select Lab,  says :
  

A Mac Mini running GraphChi can analyze Twitter's social graph from 2010—which contains 40 million users and 1.2 billion connections—in 59 minutes. "The previous published result on this problem took 400 minutes using a cluster of about 1,000 computers

<p>Introduction: To continue the graph theme Google has got into the act and released information on  Pregel . Pregel does not appear to be a new type of potato chip. Pregel is instead a scalable infrastructure...
   ...to mine a wide range of graphs. In Pregel, programs are expressed as a sequence of iterations. In each iteration, a vertex can, independently of other vertices, receive messages sent to it in the previous iteration, send messages to other vertices, modify its own and its outgoing edges' states, and mutate the graph's topology.  Currently, Pregel scales to billions of vertices and edges, but this limit will keep expanding. Pregel's applicability is harder to quantify, but so far we haven't come across a type of graph or a practical graph computing problem which is not solvable with Pregel.

<p>Introduction: I’ve largely steered clear of publicly commenting on the “NoSQL vs. Relational” conflict. Keeping in mind that this argument is more about currently available solutions and the features their developers have chosen to build in, I’d like to dig into this and provide a decidedly neutral viewpoint. In fact, by erring on the side of caution, I’ve inadvertently given myself plenty of time to consider the pros and cons of both data storage approaches, and although my mind was initially swaying toward the NoSQL camp, I can say with a fair amount of certainty, that I’ve found a good compromise.

<p>Introduction: Update :   Speed up Apache - how I went from F to A in YSlow .  Good example of using YSlow to speed up a website with solid code examples.  Every layer in the multi-layer cake that is your website contributes to how long a page takes to display.  YSlow , from Yahoo, is a cool tool for discovering how the ingredients of your site's top layer contribute to performance.
 
YSlow analyzes web pages and tells you why they're slow based on the rules for high performance web sites. YSlow is a Firefox add-on integrated with the popular Firebug web development tool.   YSlow gives you:

<p>Introduction: Scoble   the Ubiquitous has a fascinating post on how Mogulus, a live video channel startup, uses S3/EC2 and doesn't own a single server. The trends that have been happening for a while now are going mainstream. To do great things you no longer need to start by creating a huge war chest. You can forage off the land, like any good mobile, light weight fighting unit.     For a strategy hit he mentions the same needed change in perspective as Beau Lebens talked about when making   FeedBlendr  :     One tip he gave us is that when using Amazon’s services you have to design your systems with the assumption that they will never be up and running. What he means by that is services are “volatile” and can go up and down without notice. So, he’s designed his systems to survive that. He told me that it meant his engineering teams had to be quite disciplined in designing their architecture.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.91691071 <a title="1406-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-14-When_all_the_Program%27s_a_Graph_-_Prismatic%27s_Plumbing_Library.html">1406 high scalability-2013-02-14-When all the Program's a Graph - Prismatic's Plumbing Library</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At some point as a programmer you might have the insight/fear that all programming is just doing stuff to other stuff.
 
Then you may observe after coding the same stuff over again that stuff in a program often takes the form of interacting patterns of flows.
 
Then you may think hey, a program isn't only useful for coding datastructures, but a program is a kind of datastructure and that with a meta level jump you could program a program in terms of flows over data and flow over other flows.
 
That's the kind of stuff Prismatic is making available in the Graph extension to their  plumbing  package ( code examples ), which is described in an excellent post:  Graph: Abstractions for Structured Computation .
 
You may remember Prismatic from previous profile we did on HighScalability:  Prismatic Architecture - Using Machine Learning On Social Networks To Figure Out What You Should Read On The Web .

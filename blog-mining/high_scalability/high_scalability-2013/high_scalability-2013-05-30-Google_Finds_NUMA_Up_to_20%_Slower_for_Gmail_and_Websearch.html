</p><p>2 Because of the interaction between NUMA and cache sharing/contention it turns out different applications prefer different profiles for cache sharing, remote access,  cache contention, etc. [sent-8, score-0.89]
</p><p>3 More remote memory accesses can outperform more local accesses significantly (by up to 12%). [sent-9, score-1.197]
</p><p>4 Bigtable, for example, performs better with 100% remote accesses than 50% remote accesses. [sent-10, score-0.874]
</p><p>5 Which means a simple NUMA-aware scheduling can yield sizable benefits in production. [sent-11, score-0.259]
</p><p>6 The optimal mapping is highly dependent on the applications and their co- runners. [sent-12, score-0.292]
</p><p>7 Both our production WSC analysis and load-test experiments show that the performance impact of NUMA is signiﬁcant for large scale web-service applications on modern multicore servers. [sent-15, score-0.325]
</p><p>8 In our study, the performance swing due to NUMA is up to 15% on AMD Barcelona for Gmail backend and 20% on Intel Westmere for Web- search frontend. [sent-16, score-0.309]
</p><p>9 For example, bigtable beneﬁts from cache sharing and would prefer 100 % remote accesses to 50% remote. [sent-18, score-0.947]
</p><p>10 Search- frontend prefers spreading the threads to multiple caches to reduce cache contention and thus also prefers 100 % remote accesses to 50% remote. [sent-19, score-1.262]
</p><p>11 In conclusion, surprisingly, some running scenarios with more remote memory accesses may outperform scenarios with more local accesses due to an increased amount of cache contention for the latter, especially when 100% local accesses cannot be guaranteed. [sent-20, score-2.166]
</p><p>12 This tradeoff between NUMA and cache sharing/contention varies for different applications and when the application's corunner changes. [sent-21, score-0.382]
</p><p>13 The tradeoff also depends on the remote access penalty and the impact of cache contention on a given machine platform. [sent-22, score-0.855]
</p><p>14 On our Intel Westmere, more often, NUMA has a more signiﬁcant impact than cache contention. [sent-23, score-0.266]
</p><p>15 This may be due to the fact that this platform has a fairly large shared cache while the remote access latency is as large as 1. [sent-24, score-0.566]
</p><p>16 In this work, we show that remote memory accesses have a signiﬁcant performance impact on NUMA machines for these applications. [sent-26, score-0.897]
</p><p>17 And different from UMA machines, remote access latency is often a more dominating impact than cache contention on NUMA machines. [sent-27, score-0.792]
</p><p>18 This indicates that a simple NUMA-aware scheduling can already yield sizable beneﬁts in production for those platforms. [sent-28, score-0.383]
</p><p>19 Considering both contention and NUMA may provide further performance beneﬁt. [sent-30, score-0.224]
</p><p>20 However the optimal mapping is highly dependent on the applications and their co-runners. [sent-31, score-0.292]

<p>Introduction: This a guest post byRajkumar Iyer, a Member of Technical Staff at
Aerospike.About a year ago, Aerospike embarked upon a quest to increase in-
memory database performance - 1 Million TPS on a single inexpensive commodity
server. NoSQL has the reputation of speed, and we saw great benefit from
improving latency and throughput of cacheless architectures. At that time, we
took a version of Aerospike delivering about 200K TPS, improved a few things -
performance went to 500k TPS - and published the Aerospike 2.0 Community
Edition. We then used kernel tuning techniques and published therecipefor how
we achieved 1 M TPS on $5k of hardware.This year we continued the quest. Our
goal was to achieve 1 Million database transactions per second per server;
more than doubling previous performance. This compares to Cassandra's boast of
1M TPS on over 300 servers in Google Compute Engine - at a cost of $2 million
dollars per year. Weachieved thiswithout kernel tuning. This article describes

<p>Introduction: Arvid Norbergon thelibtorrent bloghas put together an excellent list
ofprinciples of high performance programs, obviously derived from hard won
experience programming on bittorrent:Two fundamental causes of performance
problems:Memory Latency. A big performance problem on modern computers is the
latency of SDRAM. The CPU waits idle for a read from memory to come
back.Context Switching. When a CPU switches context "the memory it will access
is most likely unrelated to the memory the previous context was accessing.
This often results in significant eviction of the previous cache, and requires
the switched-to context to load much of its data from RAM, which is
slow."Rules to help balance the forces of evil:Batch work. Avoid context
switching by batching work. For example, there are vector versions of system
calls like writev() and readv() that operate on more than one item per call.
An implication is that you want to merge as many writes as possible.Avoid
Magic Numbers. They don't scale.</p><p>3 0.68415421 <a title="1467-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-16-Big_List_of_20_Common_Bottlenecks.html">1246 high scalability-2012-05-16-Big List of 20 Common Bottlenecks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: InZen And The Art Of Scaling - A Koan And Epigram Approach,Russell
Sullivanoffered an interesting conjecture: there are 20 classic bottlenecks.
This sounds suspiciously like the idea that there only20 basic story plots.
And depending on how you chunkify things, it may be true, but in practice we
all know bottlenecks come in infinite flavors, all tasting of sour and ash.One
dayAurelien Broszniowskifrom Terracotta emailed me his list of bottlenecks, we
cc'ed Russell in on the conversation, he gave me his list, I have a list, and
here's the resulting stone soup.Russell said this is his "I wish I knew when I
was younger" list and I think that's an enriching way to look at it. The more
experience you have, the more different types of projects you tackle, the more
lessons you'll be able add to a list like this. So when you read this list,
and when you make your own, you are stepping through years of accumulated
experience and more than a little frustration, but in each there is a story

<p>Introduction: The paper MegaPipe: A New Programming Interface for Scalable Network I/O
(video,slides) hits the common theme that if you want to go faster you need a
better car design, not just a better driver. So that's why the authors started
with a clean-slate and designed a network API from the ground up with support
for concurrent I/O, a requirement for achieving high performance while scaling
to large numbers of connections per thread, multiple cores, etc.  What they
created is MegaPipe, "a new network programming API for message-oriented
workloads to avoid the performance issues of BSD Socket API."The result:
MegaPipe outperforms baseline Linux between 29% (for long connections) and
582% (for short connections). MegaPipe improves the performance of a modiﬁed
version of memcached between 15% and 320%. For a workload based on real-world
HTTP traces, MegaPipe boosts the throughput of nginx by 75%.What's this most

as the number of cores increase. Like everything else in life, that doesn't
appear to be generically possible:None of the nine locking schemes we consider
consistently outperforms any other one, on all target architectures or
workloads. Strictly speaking, to seek optimality, a lock algorithm should thus
be selected based on the hardware platform and the expected workload.
Abstract:This paper presents the most exhaustive study of synchronization to
date. We span multiple layers, from hardware cache-coherence protocols up to
high-level concurrent software. We do so on different types architectures,
from single-socket - uniform and nonuniform - to multi-socket - directory and
broadcastbased - many-cores. We draw a set of observations that, roughly

<p>Introduction: When you have a large population of servers you have both the opportunity and
the incentive to perform interesting studies. Authors from Google and the
University of California in Optimizing Google's Warehouse Scale Computers: The
NUMA Experience conducted such a study, taking a look at how jobs run on
clusters of machines using a NUMA architecture. Since NUMA is common on server
class machines it's a topic of general interest for those looking to maximize
machine utilization across clusters.Some of the results are surprising:The
methodology of how to attribute such fine performance variations to NUMA
effects within such a complex system is perhaps more interesting than the
results themselves. Well worth reading just for that story.The performance
swing due to NUMA is up to 15% on AMD Barcelona for Gmail backend and 20% on
Intel Westmere for Web-search frontend. Memory locality is not always King.
Because of the interaction between NUMA and cache sharing/contention it turns

<p>Introduction: To continue the graph theme Google has got into the act and released
information onPregel. Pregel does not appear to be a new type of potato chip.
Pregel is instead a scalable infrastructure......to mine a wide range of
graphs. In Pregel, programs are expressed as a sequence of iterations. In each
iteration, a vertex can, independently of other vertices, receive messages
sent to it in the previous iteration, send messages to other vertices, modify
its own and its outgoing edges' states, and mutate the graph's
topology.Currently, Pregel scales to billions of vertices and edges, but this
limit will keep expanding. Pregel's applicability is harder to quantify, but
so far we haven't come across a type of graph or a practical graph computing
problem which is not solvable with Pregel. It computes over large graphs much
faster than alternatives, and the application programming interface is easy to
use. Implementing PageRank, for example, takes only about 15 lines of code.

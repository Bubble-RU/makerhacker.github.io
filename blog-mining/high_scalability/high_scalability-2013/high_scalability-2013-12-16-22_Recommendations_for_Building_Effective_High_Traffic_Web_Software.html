at large scale internet companies.Inspired by the book "Effective Java" by
Joshua Bloch, I wanted to share my holistic recommendations on building high
traffic web software (i.e. web applications/services that serve high traffic
loads). Some of these items may not be just about software design but also
around surrounding areas such as the engineering organization, culture etc.Two
disclaimers up front:1) This is my opinion.2) There will be real world
situations where the below principles will be wrong as in all things
"software". Please use common sense all the time.Consider using more than one
datacenterThere have been numerous horror stories about businesses, ahem going
out of business because they just had a single datacenter. Its really
important to have more than one data center if you want to protect yourself
from natural disasters or electrical supply failures. Run all your datacenters
in active-active</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 Consider a sparse datacenter deploymentMake sure that your operations team or your PaaS (if you are running a private cloud) really deploys your software cluster across racks that span multiple electrical power supply phases within a data center. [sent-13, score-0.298]
</p><p>2 The switch to a rack may fail or failures may occur that may cause an entire rack to go offline, you do not want to find out at that time that all instances of your software was deployed on the same rack in a datacenter. [sent-14, score-0.286]
</p><p>3 For searching records based on fields other than the primary key, index the table or tables into a search indexer such as Lucene and expose a search service that allows searching of records by other fields which will then return the primary key of the record. [sent-34, score-0.32]
</p><p>4 Data Guard allows a near instant read replica which is passive (no clients connect to it) and Golden Gate allows a near instant active read-write replica. [sent-44, score-0.502]
</p><p>5 Hence it is recommended to multiplex application server connections through a multiplexer layer. [sent-55, score-0.461]
</p><p>6 This can be a simple netty app that runs in a cluster where each netty node can only make 25 connections to Oracle but can have as many inbound connections. [sent-56, score-0.425]
</p><p>7 At the jBoss application tier level an SPI implementation can be written for JDBC that allows jBoss to talk to the netty multiplexer layer and treat it as if it were a database. [sent-59, score-0.448]
</p><p>8 Consider using a warmup process that is automatically triggered by the PaaS or by your operations team which hits HTTP urls in your application server cluster that warm up the distributed cache. [sent-69, score-0.272]
</p><p>9 Do this warmup at night or at a time when the customer traffic on those application servers are low. [sent-70, score-0.263]
</p><p>10 Your client should be able to call ANY application server and have its query answered. [sent-78, score-0.357]
</p><p>11 The id that maintains state is passed to and from the client for every request and the data that represents a client's session is stored in the database or the distributed cache across multiple requests. [sent-80, score-0.287]
</p><p>12 Not using session stickiness also allows a rolling restart of your application server cluster thus allowing achieving a 100% uptime. [sent-83, score-0.638]
</p><p>13 54Embrace all things "reactor"The reactor based pattern has proven itself time and again, a force to reckon for high traffic software systems. [sent-113, score-0.352]
</p><p>14 A flurry of frameworks have been created that implement the reactor pattern. [sent-114, score-0.266]
</p><p>15 The places where the reactor can be used are:As a reverse proxy: nGinxAs a application server: node. [sent-115, score-0.401]
</p><p>16 Implement Call CancelInspired from one of Siddharth Anand's conferences, in a call graph of service calls, first implement timeouts in decreasing number from the top to the bottom. [sent-118, score-0.368]
</p><p>17 Next for every invocation of a call graph of services, create a UUID and set a flag for the UUID in a distributed cache:UUID: trueIf any service in the call graph times out, set the flag for the UUID to false. [sent-119, score-0.849]
</p><p>18 Now implement a servlet filter for all services that checks this flag all the time and continues processing only if the flag is true. [sent-120, score-0.473]
</p><p>19 This allows unnecessary calls from lighting up the call graph during times of high trafficImplement the GC scout protocolAgain, inspired by the same guy - Make all services also expose a TCP port through Netty that returns a empty string. [sent-122, score-0.603]
</p><p>20 If the call succeeds, then call the actual service on the instance. [sent-126, score-0.387]

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear? For years startups, like the frenetically inventive age of the 17th</p><p>3 0.16272874 <a title="1565-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-18-Amazon_Architecture.html">96 high scalability-2007-09-18-Amazon Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's
discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon
organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable
systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the
ACM Queue article have also been included.Amazon grew from a tiny online
bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering
new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden

<p>Introduction: Mollomis one of those cool SaaS companies every developer dreams of creating
when they wrack their brains looking for a viable software-as-a-service
startup. Mollom profitably runs a useful service--spam filtering--with a small
group of geographically distributed developers. Mollom helps protect nearly
40,000 websites from spam, includingone of mine, which is where I first
learned about Mollom. In a desperate attempt to stop spam on a Drupal site,
where every other form of CAPTCHA had failed miserably, I installed Mollom in
about 10 minutes and it immediately started working. That's the out of the box
experience I was looking for.From the time Mollom opened its digital
inspection system they've rejected over 373 million spams and in the process
they've learned that a stunning 90% of all messages are spam. This spam
torrent is handled by only two geographically distributed machines that handle
100 requests/ second, each running a Java application server and Cassandra. So

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byJeffrey Damick, Principal Software Engineer forNeustar.
Jeffrey has overseen the software architecture forUltraDNSfor last two and
half years as it went through substantial revitalization.UltraDNS is one the
top the DNS providers, serving manytop-level domains (TLDs)as well assecond-
level domains (SLDs). This requires handling of several hundreds of thousands
of zones with many containing millions of records each. Even with all of its
success UltraDNS had fallen into a rut several years ago, its release schedule
had become haphazard at best and the team was struggling to keep up with
feature requests in a waterfall development style.DevelopmentRealizing that
something had to be done the team came together and identified the most

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byAndy Gelfond, VP of Engineering for TripAdvisor. Andy
has been with TripAdvisor for six and a half years, wrote a lot of code in the
earlier days, and has been building and running a first class engineering and
operations team that is responsible for the worlds largest travel site.
There's an update for this article atAn Epic TripAdvisor Update: Why Not Run
On The Cloud? The Grand Experiment. For TripAdvisor, scalability is woven into
our organization on many levels - data center, software architecture,
development/deployment/operations, and, most importantly, within the culture
and organization. It is not enough to have a scalable data center, or a
scalable software architecture. The process of designing, coding, testing, and
deploying code also needs to be scalable. All of this starts with hiring and a
culture and an organization that values and supports a distributed, fast, and
effective development and operation of a complex and highly scalable consumer

<p>Introduction: While exploring deep into some dusty old library stacks, I dug up Nostradamus'
long lostNoSQLcodex. What are the chances? Strangely, it also gave the plot to
the next Dan Brown novel, but I left that out for reasons of sanity. About
NoSQL, here is what Nosty (his friends call him Nosty) predicted are the signs
you may need a NoSQL database...You noticed a lot of your database fields are
really serialized complex objects in disguise. Why bother with a RDBMS at all
then? Storing serialized objects in a relational database is like being on the
pill while trying to get pregnant, a bit counter productive. Just use a
schemaless database from the start.Using a standard query language has become
too confining. You just want to be free. SQL is so easy, so convenient, and so
standard, it's reallynot a challengeanymore. You need to be different. Then
NoSQL is for you. Each has their own completely differentquery mechanism.Your
toolbox only contains a hammer. Hammers while wonderfully versatile, c</p><p>2 0.97606343 <a title="1565-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-15-How_Google%27s_Instant_Previews_Reduces_HTTP_Requests.html">941 high scalability-2010-11-15-How Google's Instant Previews Reduces HTTP Requests</a></p>

Strategy: Biggest Performance Impact Is To Reduce The Number Of HTTP Requests
and one of the major ideas behind the design Instant Previews is to reduce the
number of HTTP requests through a few well chosen tricks. Cosmic!Some of what
Google does to reduce HTTP requests:Data URIs, which are are base64 encodings
of image data, are used instead of static images that are served from the
server. This means the whole preview can be pieced together from image slices
in one request as both the data and the image are returned in the same
request. Google found thateven though base64 encoding adds about 33% to the
size of the image, tests showed that gzip-compressed data URIs are comparable
in size to the o</p><p>3 0.96870494 <a title="1565-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-20-A_Scalability_Lament.html">659 high scalability-2009-07-20-A Scalability Lament</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In Scalabilityissues for dummiesAlex Barrera talks movingly about the
challenges he faces trying to scale his startupinkzeeas the lone developer.
Inkzee is anonline news reader that automatically groups similar topics. This
is a cool problem and is one you know right away is going to have some killer
scalability problems as the number of feeds and the number of users increase.
And these problems lead to the point of the post, toexplain here what are
scalability problems and how deep the repercussions are for a small company,
which Alex does admirably.Some takeaways:Sites are composed of a frontend and
backend. The backend isn't visible to users, but it does all the work and this
is where the scalability problems show up.As more and more users use a site it
becomes slow because more users reveal bottlenecks in the system that weren't
visible before.There can be many many reasons for these bottlenecks. They are
often very hard to find because the backend systems are very complex and have</p><p>4 0.96535045 <a title="1565-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-09-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_July_9%2C_2010.html">854 high scalability-2010-07-09-Hot Scalability Links for July 9, 2010</a></p>

does bring up some issues worth arguing about. Hacker News has agood

computationally expensive. My car is eight years old this year. It has less
than 30,000 miles on it.Yes, you heard that right, less than 30,000 miles. I
don't drive my car very often because, well, my commute is a short trip down
two flights of stairs. I don't need to go very far when I do drive it's only
ten miles or so round trip to the grocery store. So from my perspective, gas
isn't really very expensive. I may use a tank of gas a month, which works out
to … well, it's really not even worth mentioning the cost. But for someone who
commutes every day - especially someone who commutes a long-distance every day
- gas is expensive. It's a significant expense every month for them and they

<p>Introduction: Update 2:Presentation from theNoSQL conference:slides,video.Update:Why you
won't be building your killer app on a distributed hash tableby Jonathan
Ellis.Why I think Cassandra is the most promising of the open-source
distributed databases --you get a relatively rich data model and a
distribution model that supports efficient range queries. These are not things
that can be grafted on top of a simpler DHT foundation, so Cassandra will be
useful for a wider variety of applications.James Hamilton has published a
thorough summary of Facebook's Cassandra, another scalable key-value store for
your perusal. It's open source and is described as a "BigTable data model
running on a Dynamo-like infrastructure." Cassandra is used in Facebook as an
email search system containing 25TB and over 100m mailboxes.Google Code for

<p>Introduction: The future is live. The future is real-time. The future is now. That's the
hype anyway. And as it has a habit of doing, the hype is slowly becoming
reality. We are seeing live searches, live tweets, live location, live reality
augmentation, live crab (fresh and local), and live event publishing. One of
the most challenging of all live technologies is that of live video
broadcasting. Imagine a world in which everyone becomes a broadcaster and a
consumer of video streams, all in real-time (< 250 msec latency), all so you
can talk and interact directly without feeling like you are in the middle of a
time shift war. The resources and the engineering needed to make this happened
must be substantial. How do you do that?To find out I talked to Kyle Vogt,
Justin.tv Founder and VP of Engineering. Justin.tv certainly has the numbers.

upload game, reportedly uploading nearly 30 hours per minute of video compared

<p>Introduction: In 1999 Dan Kegel issued a big hairy audacious challenge to web servers:It's
time for web servers to handle ten thousand clients simultaneously, don't you
think? After all, the web is a big place now.This became known as theC10K
problem. Engineers solved the C10K scalability problems by fixing OS kernels
and moving away from threaded servers like Apache to event-driven servers like
Nginx and Node.Today we are considering an even bigger goal, how to support10
Million Concurrent Connections, which requires even more radical techniques.No
similar challenge was issued for managing servers in a datacenter, but
according toDave Nearyfrom Red Hat, in a recentFLOSS Weekly episode, we have
passed the 10K barrier for server management with 10,000 or more servers
managed per sysadmin.Should we let this milestone pass without
mention?Absolutely not! It's a stunning accomplishment with 200x-2000x
increases in productivity. Dave said he remembered in the 1990s it took one
sysadmin to manage 4 or 5 W</p><p>6 0.61833912 <a title="1493-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-29-Strategy%3A_Put_Mobile_Video_Into_Cold_Storage_After_30_Days.html">1201 high scalability-2012-02-29-Strategy: Put Mobile Video Into Cold Storage After 30 Days</a></p>

<p>Introduction: James Hamilton in Counting Servers is Hard has an awesome breakdown of whatone
million plus servers really means in terms of resource usage. The summary from
his calculations are eye popping:Facilities: 15 to 30 large datacentersCapital
expense: $4.25 BillionTotal power: 300MWPower Consumption: 2.6TWh annuallyThe

Theorem: A Proposed Theorem for the Trade-offs in Horizontally Scalable Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Successful software design is all about trade-offs. In the typical (if there
is such a thing) distributed system, recognizing the importance of trade-offs
within the design of your architecture is integral to the success of your
system. Despite this reality, I see time and time again, developers choosing a
particular solution based on an ill-placed belief in their solution as a
“silver bullet”, or a solution that conquers all, despite the inevitable
occurrence of changing requirements. Regardless of the reasons behind this
phenomenon, I’d like to outline a few of the methods I use to ensure that I’m
making good scalable decisions without losing sight of the trade-offs that
accompany them. I’d also like to compile (pun intended) the issues at hand, by
formulating a simple theorem that we can use to describe this oft occurring
situation.</p><p>3 0.68771482 <a title="1493-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-14-OpenSpaces.org_community_site_launched_-_framework_for_building_scale-out_applications.html">212 high scalability-2008-01-14-OpenSpaces.org community site launched - framework for building scale-out applications</a></p>
<p>Introduction: GigaSpaces launchedOpenSpaces.org, a community web site for developers who
wish to utilize and contribute to the open sourceOpenSpaces development
framework.OpenSpaces extends the Spring Framework for enterprise Java
development, and leverages theGigaSpaces eXtreme Application Platform(XAP) for
data caching, messaging and as the container for application business logic.
It is designed for building highly-available, scale-out applications in
distributed environments, such as SOA, cloud computing, grids and commodity
servers. OpenSpaces is widely used in a variety of industries, including
financial services, telecommunications, manufacturing and retail -- and across
the web in e-commerce, Web 2.0 applications such as social networking sites,
search and more.breakOpenSpaces.org already lists more than two
dozenprojectssubmitted by the developer community, including GigaSpaces
customers, partners and employees. Innovative projects include an instant

<p>Introduction: In It's Time for Low Latency  Stephen Rumble et al. explore the idea that it's
time to rearchitect our stack to live in the modern era of low-latency
datacenter instead of high-latency WANs. The implications for
programarchitectures will be revolutionary.  Luiz Andre Barroso, Distinguished
Engineer at Google, sees ultra low latency as a way to make computer
resources, to be as much as possible, fungible, that is they are
interchangeable and location independent, effectively turning a datacenter
into single computer. Abstract from the paper:The operating systems community
has ignored network latency for too long. In the past, speed-of-light delays
in wide area networks and unoptimized network hardware have made sub-100µs
round-trip times impossible. However, in the next few years datacenters will
be deployed with low-latency Ethernet. Without the burden of propagation
delays in the datacenter campus and network delays in the Ethernet devices, it
will be up to us to ﬁnish the job and see</p><p>5 0.67203087 <a title="1493-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-24-Yandex_Architecture.html">258 high scalability-2008-02-24-Yandex Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:Anatomy of a crash in a new part of Yandex written in Django. Writing
to a magic session variable caused an unexpected write into an InnoDB database
on every request. Writes took 6-7 seconds because of index rebuilding. Lots of
useful details on the sizing of their system, what went wrong, and how they
fixed it.Yandex is a Russian search engine with 3.5 billion pages in their
search index. We only know a few fun facts about how they do things, nothing
at a detailed architecture level. Hopefully we'll learn more later, but I
thought it would still be interesting. From Allen Stern's interview with
Yandex's CTO Ilya Segalovich, we learn:3.5 billion pages in the search
index.Over several thousand servers.35 million searches a day.Several data
centers around Russia.Two-layer architecture.The database is split in pieces
and when a search is requested, it pulls the bits from the different database
servers and brings it together for the user.Languages used: c++, perl, some
java.FreeBSD</p><p>6 0.67093235 <a title="1493-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-10-Scalability_Perspectives_%231%3A_Nicholas_Carr_%E2%80%93_The_Big_Switch.html">439 high scalability-2008-11-10-Scalability Perspectives #1: Nicholas Carr – The Big Switch</a></p>

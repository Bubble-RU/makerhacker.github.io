<p>Introduction: Update 6: :  Back to the Future for Data Storage .  We are in the middle of a renaissance in data storage with the application of many new ideas and techniques; there's huge potential for breaking out of thinking about data storage in just one way.   Update 5 :  Building Scalable Web Applications with Google App Engine  by Brett Slatkin.
 
 Update 4 :  Why Google App Engine is broken and what Google must do to fix it  by Aral Balkan.  We don't care that it can scale. We care that it does scale. And that it scales when you need it the most.   Issues: 1MB limit on data structures; 1MB limit on data structures; the short-term high CPU quota; quotas in general; Admin? What's that?  Update 3 : BigTable  Blues . Catherine Devlin couldn't port an application to GAE because it can't do basic filtering and can't search 5,000 records without timing out: "Querying from 5000 records - too much for the mighty BigTable, apparently." Followup:  not the future database .

<p>Introduction: We can all learn from problems. The Google App Engine team has created a teachable moment through a remarkably honest and forthcoming  post-mortem for February 24th, 2010 outage  post, chronicling in elaborate detail a power outage that took down Google App Engine for a few hours.
 
The world is ending! The cloud is unreliable! Jump ship! Not. This is not evidence that the cloud is a beautiful, powerful and unsinkable ship that goes down on its maiden voyage. Stuff happens, no matter how well you prepare. If you think private datacenters don't go down, well, then I have some rearangeable deck chairs to sell you. The goal is to keep improving and minimizing those failure windows. From that perspective there is a lot to learn from the problems the Google App Engine team encountered and how they plan to fix them.
 
Please read the article for all the juicy details, but here's what struck me as key:

<p>Introduction: How do you scale a viral Facebook app that has skyrocketed to a mind boggling 65 million installs (the population of France)? That's the fortunate problem  BuddyPoke  co-founder Dave Westwood has and he talked about his solution at Wednesday's  Facebook Meetup . Slides for the complete talk are  here .  For those not quite sure what BuddyPoke is, it's a social network application that lets users show their mood, hug, kiss, and poke their friends through on-line avatars.
 
In many ways BuddyPoke is the quintessentially modern web application. It thrives off the energy of social network driven ecosystems. Game play mechanics, viral loops, and creative monetization strategies are all part of if its everyday conceptualization. It mashes together different technologies, not in a dark Frankensteining sort of way,  but in a smart way that gets the most bang for the buck. Part of it runs on Facebook servers (free). Part of it runs on flash in a browser (free). Part of it runs on a storage clou</p><p>4 0.83026546 <a title="1432-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-08-Stuff_to_Watch_from_Google_IO_2011.html">1055 high scalability-2011-06-08-Stuff to Watch from Google IO 2011</a></p>

Good discussion of scaling and why it's hard; 10,000 queries per second is a large app that needs good architecting; a good discussion of GAE's predictive scaling formula of how it decides w</p><p>5 0.82727438 <a title="1432-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-05-Strategy%3A_Planning_for_a_Power_Outage_Google_Style.html">789 high scalability-2010-03-05-Strategy: Planning for a Power Outage Google Style</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We can all learn from problems. The Google App Engine team has created a teachable moment through a remarkably honest and forthcoming  post-mortem for February 24th, 2010 outage  post, chronicling in elaborate detail a power outage that took down Google App Engine for a few hours.
 
The world is ending! The cloud is unreliable! Jump ship! Not. This is not evidence that the cloud is a beautiful, powerful and unsinkable ship that goes down on its maiden voyage. Stuff happens, no matter how well you prepare. If you think private datacenters don't go down, well, then I have some rearangeable deck chairs to sell you. The goal is to keep improving and minimizing those failure windows. From that perspective there is a lot to learn from the problems the Google App Engine team encountered and how they plan to fix them.
 
Please read the article for all the juicy details, but here's what struck me as key:

<p>Introduction: Update :   Speed up Apache - how I went from F to A in YSlow .  Good example of using YSlow to speed up a website with solid code examples.  Every layer in the multi-layer cake that is your website contributes to how long a page takes to display.  YSlow , from Yahoo, is a cool tool for discovering how the ingredients of your site's top layer contribute to performance.
 
YSlow analyzes web pages and tells you why they're slow based on the rules for high performance web sites. YSlow is a Firefox add-on integrated with the popular Firebug web development tool.   YSlow gives you:

<p>Introduction: I’ve largely steered clear of publicly commenting on the “NoSQL vs. Relational” conflict. Keeping in mind that this argument is more about currently available solutions and the features their developers have chosen to build in, I’d like to dig into this and provide a decidedly neutral viewpoint. In fact, by erring on the side of caution, I’ve inadvertently given myself plenty of time to consider the pros and cons of both data storage approaches, and although my mind was initially swaying toward the NoSQL camp, I can say with a fair amount of certainty, that I’ve found a good compromise.

<p>Introduction: Scoble   the Ubiquitous has a fascinating post on how Mogulus, a live video channel startup, uses S3/EC2 and doesn't own a single server. The trends that have been happening for a while now are going mainstream. To do great things you no longer need to start by creating a huge war chest. You can forage off the land, like any good mobile, light weight fighting unit.     For a strategy hit he mentions the same needed change in perspective as Beau Lebens talked about when making   FeedBlendr  :     One tip he gave us is that when using Amazon’s services you have to design your systems with the assumption that they will never be up and running. What he means by that is services are “volatile” and can go up and down without notice. So, he’s designed his systems to survive that. He told me that it meant his engineering teams had to be quite disciplined in designing their architecture.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.93423164 <a title="1432-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-01-Khan_Academy_Checkbook_Scaling_to_6_Million_Users_a_Month_on_GAE.html">1432 high scalability-2013-04-01-Khan Academy Checkbook Scaling to 6 Million Users a Month on GAE</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Khan Academy   is a non profit company started by  Salman Khan  with the Big Hairy Audacious Goal of providing a free, world class education to anyone, anywhere, anytime. That’s a lot of knowledge. Having long been inspired and captivated by the Khan Academy, I was really curious to know how they plan to do it.   Ben Kamens  , lead developer at Khan Academy, gives the somewhat surprising answer in an interview:  How to Scale your Startup to Millions of Users .
  The  short answer : develop a strong team, focus on features, let   Google App Engine   do the heavy lifting.
   Some people seem to be turned off by all the GAE love in the interview. Part of it is that the interviewer is Fred Sauer, Developer Advocate for Google App Engine, so there’s a level of familiarity between the two. But the biggest part is simply that they really like GAE, for all the reasons your are supposed to like GAE. And that’s OK. In this day and age you are free to love whichever platform you choose.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Ivan de Prado  and  Pere Ferrera , founders of  Datasalt , the company behind  Pangool  and  Splout SQL  Big Data open-source projects.  
 
The amount of payments performed using credit cards is huge. It is clear that there is inherent value in the data that can be derived from analyzing all the transactions. Client fidelity, demographics, heat maps of activity, shop recommendations, and many other statistics are useful to both clients and shops for improving their relationship with the market. At  Datasalt  we have developed a system in collaboration with the  BBVA bank  that is able to analyze years of data and serve insights and statistics to different low-latency web and mobile applications.
 
The main challenge we faced besides processing Big Data input is that  the output was also Big Data, and even bigger than the input . And this output needed to be served quickly, under high load.
 
The solution we developed has an infrastructure cost of just a few tho</p><p>6 0.92053103 <a title="1432-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-16-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_September_16%2C_2011.html">1117 high scalability-2011-09-16-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For September 16, 2011</a></p>

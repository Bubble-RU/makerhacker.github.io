<p>Introduction: In many posts, such as: The Future of the Parallelism and its Challenges I
mentioned that synchronization the access to the shared resource is the major
challenge to write parallel code.The synchronization and coordination take
long time from the overall execution time, which reduce the benefits of the
parallelism; the synchronization and coordination also reduce the
scalability.There are many forms of synchronization and coordination, such
as:Create Task object in frameworks such as: Microsoft TPL, Intel TDD, and
Parallel Runtime Library. Create and enqueue task objects require
synchronization that it's takes long time especially if we create it into
recursive work such as: Quick Sort algorithm.Synchronization the access to
shared data.But there are a few techniques to avoid these issues, such as:
Shared-Nothing, Actor Model, and Hyper Object (A.K.A. Combinable Object).
Simply if we reduce the shared data by re-architect our code this will gives
us a huge benefits in performance and s</p><p>4 0.13051505 <a title="1459-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-10-Paper%3A_Scalable_Atomic_Visibility_with_RAMP_Transactions_-_Scale_Linearly_to_100_Servers.html">1629 high scalability-2014-04-10-Paper: Scalable Atomic Visibility with RAMP Transactions - Scale Linearly to 100 Servers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We are not yet at the End of History for database theory asPeter Bailisand
theDatabase Groupat UC Berkeley continue to prove with a greatcompanion blog
post to their new paper: Scalable Atomic Visibility with RAMP Transactions. I
like the approach of pairing a blog post with a paper. A paper almost by
definition is formal, but a blog post can help put a paper in context and give
it some heart.From the abstract:Databases can provide scalability by
partitioning data across several servers. However, multi-partition, multi-
operation transactional access is often expensive, employing coordination-
intensive locking, validation, or scheduling mechanisms. Accordingly, many
real-world systems avoid mechanisms that provide useful semantics formulti-
partition operations. This leads to incorrect behavior for a large class of
applications including secondary indexing,foreign key enforcement, and
materialized view maintenance. In this work, we identify a new isolation model

<p>Introduction: What do you get when you take a SQL database and start a new implementation
from scratch, taking advantage of the latest research and modern hardware?
Mike Stonebraker, the sword wielding Johnny Appleseed of the database world,
hopes you get something like his new database,VoltDB: a pure SQL, pure ACID,
pure OLTP, shared nothing, sharded, scalable, lockless, open source, in-memory
DBMS, purpose-built for running hundreds of thousands of transactions a
second. VoltDBclaims to be100 times faster than MySQL, up to 13 times faster
thanCassandra, and 45 times faster than Oracle, with near-linear scaling.Will
VoltDB kill off the new NoSQL upstarts? Will VoltDB cause a mass extinction of
ancient databases? Probably no and no to both questions, but it's a product
with a definite point-of-view and is worth a look as the transaction component
in your system. But will it be right for you? Let's see...I first heard the

<p>Introduction: Neil Conwayfrom Berkeley CS is giving an advanced level talk ata meetup today
in San Francisco on a new paper: Logic and Lattices for Distributed
Programming \- extending set logic to support CRDT-style lattices. The
description of the meetup is probably the clearest introduction to the
paper:Developers are increasingly choosing datastores that sacrifice strong
consistency guarantees in exchange for improved performance and availability.
Unfortunately, writing reliable distributed programs without the benefit of
strong consistency can be very challenging. In this talk, I'll discuss work
from our group at UC Berkeley that aims to make it easier to write distributed
programs without relying on strong consistency. Bloom is a declarative
programming language for distributed computing, while CALM is an analysis
technique that identifies programs that are guaranteed to be eventually
consistent. I'll then discuss our recent work on extending CALM to support a
broader range of programs, drawin</p><p>4 0.80051678 <a title="1459-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-18-Georeplication%3A_When_Bad_Things_Happen_to_Good_Systems.html">1374 high scalability-2012-12-18-Georeplication: When Bad Things Happen to Good Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Georeplication is one of the standard techniques for dealing when bad things--
failure and latency--happen to good systems. The problem is always: how do you
do that? Murat Demirbas, Associate Professor at SUNY Buffalo, has a couple of
really good posts that can help:MDCC: Multi-Data Center Consistency andMaking
Geo-Replicated Systems Fast as Possible, Consistent when Necessary. In MDCC:
Multi-Data Center Consistency Murat discusses a paper that says synchronous
wide-area replication can be feasible. There's a quick and clear explanation
of Paxos and various optimizations that is worth the price of admission. We
find that strong consistency doesn't have to be lost across a WAN:The good
thing about using Paxos over the WAN is you /almost/ get the full CAP  (all
three properties: consistency, availability, and partition-freedom). As we
discussed earlier (Paxos taught), Paxos is CP, that is, in the presence of a
partition, Paxos keeps consistency over availability. But, Paxos can still

<p>Introduction: Distributed transactions are costly because they useagreement protocols.
Calvin says, surprisingly, that using a deterministic database allows you to
avoid the use of agreement protocols. The approach is to use a deterministic
transaction layer that does all the hard work before acquiring locks and the
beginning of transaction execution.Overview:Many distributed storage systems
achieve high data access throughput via partitioning and replication, each
system with its own advantages and tradeoffs. In order to achieve high
scalability, however, today's systems generally reduce transactional support,
disallowing single transactions from spanning multiple partitions. Calvin is a
practical transaction scheduling and data replication layer that uses a
deterministic ordering guarantee to signiďŹ cantly reduce the normally
prohibitive contention costs associated with distributed transactions. Unlike
previous deterministic database system prototypes, Calvin supports disk-based
storage, scales nea</p><p>6 0.77522385 <a title="1459-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-01-Myth%3A_Eric_Brewer_on_Why_Banks_are_BASE_Not_ACID_-_Availability_Is_Revenue_.html">1450 high scalability-2013-05-01-Myth: Eric Brewer on Why Banks are BASE Not ACID - Availability Is Revenue </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Looks like an interesting take on "a completely asynchronous, low-latency
transaction management protocol, in line with the fully distributed NoSQL
architecture."Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores
overview:Implementing ACID transactions has been a longstanding challenge for
NoSQL systems. Because these systems are based on a sharded architecture,
transactions necessarily require coordination across multiple servers. Past
work in this space has relied either on heavyweight protocols such as Paxos or
clock synchronization for this coordination.This paper presents a novel
protocol for coordinating distributed transactions with ACID semantics on top
of a sharded data store. Called linear transactions, this protocol achieves
scalability by distributing the coordination task to only those servers that
hold relevant data for each transaction. It achieves high performance by
serializing only those transactions whose concurrent execution could
potentially yield a violation of ACI</p><p>3 0.90637171 <a title="1459-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-16-Paper%3A_An_Experimental_Investigation_of_the_Akamai_Adaptive_Video_Streaming.html">991 high scalability-2011-02-16-Paper: An Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Video is hot on the Internet and people are really interested in knowing how
to make it work. Dan Rayburnhas a post pointing to a fascinating paper: An
Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming, which talks
in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai
use to serve video over on an inherently video unfriendly medium like the
Internet. For Akamai they found:Each video is encoded in five versions at
different bit rates and stored in separate files.The client sends commands to
the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control
algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds. Akamai uses only the video
level to adapt the video source to the available bandwidth, whereas the frame
rate of the video is kept constant.When a sudden drop in the available
bandwidth occurs, short interruptions of the video playback can occur due to
the a large actuation delay.For a sudden increase of the available bandwidth,

retailers are focusing their marketing efforts on Facebook and subsequent
applications. Furthermore, over 71 percent of users have confirmed they are
more likely to make a purchase after "liking" a brand they find online.

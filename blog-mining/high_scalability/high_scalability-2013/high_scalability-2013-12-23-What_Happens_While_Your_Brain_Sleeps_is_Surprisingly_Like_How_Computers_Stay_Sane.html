</p><p>10 The secondary is usually in some sort of simplified state so that it doesn't suffer from all the degrading influences experience by the primary. [sent-41, score-0.346]
</p><p>11 One strategy is to have the primary periodically failover to the secondary so that the system reinitializes, removing many of the flaws that have accumulated over time. [sent-42, score-0.665]

<p>Introduction: For solutions take a look at:7 Life Saving Scalability Defenses Against Load
Monster Attacks.This is a look at all the bad things that can happen to your
carefully crafted program as loads increase: all hell breaks lose. Sure, you
can scale out or scale up, but you can also choose to program better. Make
your system handle larger loads. This saves money because fewer boxes are
needed and it will make the entire application more reliable and have better
response times. And it can be quite satisfying as a programmer.Large Number Of
ObjectsWe usually get into scaling problems when the number of objects gets
larger. Clearly resource usage of all types is stressed as the number of
objects grow.Continuous Failures Makes An Infinite Event StreamDuring large
network failure scenarios there is never time for the system recover. We are

<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built

<p>Introduction: A big part of engineering for a quality experience is bringing in thelong
tail. An improbable severe failure can ruin your experience of a site, even if
your average experience is quite good. That's where building for resilience
comes in. Resiliency used to be outside the realm of possibility for the
common system. It was simply too complex and too expensive.An evolution has
been underway, making 2013 possibly the first time resiliency is truly on the
table as a standard part of system architectures. We are getting the clouds,
we are getting the tools, and prices are almost low enough.Even Netflix,real
leadersin the resiliency architecture game, took some heat for relying
completely on Amazon's ELB and not having a backup load balancing system,
leading to a prolonged Christmas Eve failure. Adrian Cockcroft, Cloud
Architect at Netflix, said they've investigated creating their own load
balancing service, but that "we try not to invest in undifferentiated heavy

<p>Introduction: Perhaps it is because the whole world feels as if it's riding on the edge of a
jagged knife that the idea ofresilienceis becoming a dominant theme across so
many domains. Resilience in beings first developed when cells evolved a way
ofmaintaining inner orderthrough homeostatic (stability through constancy)
mechanisms. After homeostasis was mastered,allostasis(stability through
change) developed as a way of responding to a dynamic world of challenge. In
economics we have the idea ofTransition Towns, which emphasizes developing
local economies as a way of being resilient to global failures. In agriculture
we have the idea ofpermaculture, building a permanent agriculture by embracing
diversity, sustainability, perennial systems, avoiding monocultures, and
usingedge thinking. There are many more examples, includingpsychological
resilienceand the legendaryresilience of ecosystems.To explore the idea of
resiliency we'll look at a few sources:Collapse Dynamics: Phase Transitions in

<p>Introduction: With a new Planet of the Apes coming out, this may be a touchy subject with
our new overlords, but Netflix is using a whole lot more trouble injecting
monkeys to test and iteratively harden their systems. We learned previously
how Netflix used Chaos Monkey, a tool to test failover handling by
continuously failing EC2 nodes. That was just a start. More monkeys have been
added to the barrel. Node failure is just one problem in a system. Imagine a
problem and you can imagine creating a monkey to test if your system is
handling that problem properly. Yury Izrailevsky talks about just this
approach in this very interesting post: The Netflix Simian Army.I know what
you are thinking, if monkeys are so great then why has Netflix been down
lately. Dmuino addressedthis potential embarrassment, putting all fears of
cloud inferiority to rest:Unfortunately we're not running 100% on the cloud
today. We're working on it, and we could use more help. The latest outage was

<p>Introduction: How do you turn Big Data into fast, useful, and interesting visualizations?
UsingRand technology calledNanocubes. The visualizations are stunning and
amazingly reactive. Almost as interesting as the technologies behind
them.David Smith wrote agreat articleexplaining the technology and showing a
demo by Simon Urbanek of a visualization that uses 32Tb of Twitter data. It
runs smoothly and interactively on a single machine with 16Gb of RAM.  For
more information and demos go tonanocubes.net.David Smith sums it up
nicely:Despite the massive number of data points and the beauty and complexity
of the real-time data visualization, it runs impressively quickly. The
underlying data structure is based on Nanocubes, a fast datastructure for in-
memory data cubes. The basic idea is that nanocubes aggregate data
hierarchically, so that as you zoom in and out of the interactive application,
one pixel on the screen is mapped to just one data point, aggregated from the
many that sit "behind" that pixe</p><p>2 0.93535823 <a title="1568-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-20-Smart_Companies_Fail_Because_they_Do_Everything_Right_-_Staying_Alive_to_Scale.html">1410 high scalability-2013-02-20-Smart Companies Fail Because they Do Everything Right - Staying Alive to Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wired has awonderful interview with Clayton Christensen, author of the tech
ninja's bible, Innovator's Dilemma. Innovation is the name of the game in
Silicon Valley and if you want to understand the rules of the game this
article is a quick and clear way of learning. Everything is simply explained
with compelling examples by the man himself.Just as every empire has fallen,
every organization is open to disruption. It's the human condition to become
comfortable and discount potential dangers. It takes a great deal of
mindfulness to outwit and outlast the human condition. If you want to be the
disruptor and avoid being the disruptee, this is good stuff.He also talks
about his new book,The Capitalist's Dilemma, which addresses this puzzle: if
corporations are doing so well why are individuals doing so bad?If someone can
help you see a deep meaningful pattern in life then they haven't brought you a
fish, they've taught you how to fish. That's what Christensen does. Here's a

<p>Introduction: There's a deep similarity between how long running systems like our brains and
computers accumulate errors and repair themselves. Reboot it. Isn't that the
common treatment for most computer ailments? And you may have noticed now that
your iPhone supports background processing it reboots a lot more often? Your
DVR, phone, computer, router, car, and an untold number of long running
computer systems all suffer from a nasty problem: over time they accumulate
flaws and die or go crazy.Now think about your brain. It's a long running
program running on very complex and error prone hardware. How does your brain
keep itself sane over time? The answer may be found in something we spend a
third of our lives doing. Sleep.There's new research out on how our brains are
cleansed during sleep that has some interesting parallels to how we keep long
running hardware-software systems up and running properly. This is a fun
topic. Let's explore it a little more.One of the most frustrating system tests

Adam Langley started it all with his article  Overclocking SSL  and has made a rebuttal to the F5 article in  Still not computationally expensive . 
 
 My car is eight years old this year. It has less than 30,000 miles on it. 
 
Yes, you heard that right, less than 30,000 miles. I don’t drive my car very often because, well, my commute is a short trip down two flights of stairs. I don’t need to go very far when I do drive it’s only ten miles or so round trip to the grocery store. So from my perspective, gas isn’t really very expensive. I may use a tank of gas a month, which works out to … well, it’s really not even worth mentioning the cost. But for someone who commutes every day – especially someone who commutes a long-distance every day – gas is expensive. It’s a significant expense every month for them and th</p><p>3 0.14504999 <a title="1494-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is an interesting tidbit from near the end of the Packet Pushers podcast  Show 15 – Saving the Web With Dinky Putt Putt Firewalls . The conversation was about how SSL connections need to terminate before they can be processed by a WAF ( Web Application Firewall ), which inspects HTTP for security problems like SQL injection and cross-site scripting exploits. Much was made that if programmers did their job better these appliances wouldn't be necessary, but I digress.
 
To  terminate SSL  most shops run SSL connections into Intel based Linux boxes running Apache. This setup is convenient for developers, but it's not optimized for SSL, so it's slow and costly. Much of the capacity of these servers are unnecessarily consumed processing SSL.
 
Load balancers on the other hand have crypto cards that terminate SSL very efficiently in hardware. Efficiently enough that if you are willing to get rid of the general purpose Linux boxes and use your big iron load balancers, your server count c</p><p>6 0.13150208 <a title="1494-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-07-Startups_are_Creating_a_New_System_of_the_World_for_IT.html">1240 high scalability-2012-05-07-Startups are Creating a New System of the World for IT</a></p>

 Quotable Quotes:                       
 
  Ross Tur : the tricks you learned to make things big are not the same tricks you can apply to make things infinite.  
  @gclaramunt : Son, I'm getting old, but let me tell you a secret: programming is hard, and high scalability and concurrent programming... frigging hard! 
 
 
  @Carnage4Life : At Apple the iOS team didn't see iPhone hardware or hardware team see OS until it shipped 
  @adrianco :  #ebspio caps iops but latency variance is much lower than EBS 
  @bernardgolden : RT @peakscale: A culture of automation is 10x more important than deployment/test/monkey thing you'd like to discuss < devops calling 
  @JayCollier : 50 years ago, school standardization was needed for scale. Now, scalability and flexibility (variability) can coexist. #FOL2012 
  @adrianco : Compared to vanilla EBS many times better for random reads. Bandwidth limits both for sequential and writes.  #ebspio

 Quotable Quotes:                             
 
  Thad Starner : the longer accessing a device exceeds 2s, the more its actually usage would decrease exponentially. Thus, he made a claim that wrist watch interface always sitting on one's wrist ready to use should be more successful than mobile phones which have to pulled out of the pocket.  
  @joedevon : We came for scalability but we stayed for agility #NoSQL

<p>Introduction: In the "should I or shouldn't I" debate around deploying SSD, it always helps to have real-world data. Fiesta! with a  live-blog    summary of a presentation by Kenny Gorman on  Shutterfly on MongoDB Performance Tuning .
  

What if you still need more performance after doing all of this tuning? One option is to use SSDs. Shutterfly uses  Facebook’s flashcache : kernel module to cache data on SSD. Designed for MySQL/InnoDB. SSD in front of a disk, but exposed as a single mount point. This only makes sense when you have lots of physical I/O. Shutterfly saw a speedup of 500% w/ flashcache. A benefit is that you can delay sharding: less complexity.

  
The whole  series of posts  has a lot of great information and is worth a longer look, especially if you are considering using MongoDB.

<p>Introduction: If Google was a boxer then MapReduce would be a probing right hand that sets up the massive left hook that is  Dremel , Google's—scalable (thousands of CPUs, petabytes of data, trillions of rows), SQL based, columnar, interactive (results returned in seconds), ad-hoc—analytics system. If Google was a magician then MapReduce would be the shiny thing that distracts the mind while the trick goes unnoticed. I say that because even though Dremel has been around internally at Google since 2006, we have not heard a whisper about it. All we've heard about is MapReduce, clones of which have inspired entire new industries.  Tricky .
 
Dremel, according to Brian Bershad, Director of Engineering at Google, is targeted at solving  BigData class problems :
  

While we all know that systems are huge and will get even huger, the implications of this size on programmability, manageability, power, etc. is hard to comprehend.

<p>Introduction: Update  :  as of the end of Q2 2011,  Akamai had 95,811  servers deployed globally.     
 
Akamai is the CDN to the stars. It claims to deliver between 15 and 30 percent of all Web traffic, with major customers like Facebook, Twitter, Apple, and the US military. Traditionally quite secretive, we get a peek behind the curtain in this paper:  The Akamai Network: A Platform for High-Performance Internet Applications  by Erik Nygren, Ramesh Sitaraman, and Jennifer Sun. 
  Abstract:
 Comprising more than 61,000 servers located across nearly 1,000 networks in 70 countries worldwide, the Akamai platform delivers hundreds of billions of Internet interactions daily, helping thousands of enterprises boost the performance and reliability of their Internet applications. In this paper, we give an overview of the components and capabilities of this large-scale distributed computing platform, and offer some insight into its architecture, design principles, operation, and management.

<p>Introduction: Wildly popular VC blogger  Fred Wilson  defines in an excellent  27 minute video  the ten most important criteria he uses when deciding to give the gold, that is, fund a web application. Note, this video is  from 2010 , so no doubt the ideas are still valid, but the importance of mobile vs web apps has probably shifted to mobile, as Mr. Wilson says in a recent post:  mobile is growing like a weed . 
  
   Speed  - speed is more than a feature, it's a requirement. Mainstream users are unforgiving. If something is slow they won't use it. Pingdom is used to track speed across their portfolio. A trend they've noticed is that as an application slows down they don't grow as quickly.   
   Instant Utility  - a service must be instantly useful to users. Lengthy setup and configuration is a killer. Tricks like crawling the web to populate information you expect to get from your users later makes the service initially useful. YouTube won, for example, with instant availability of uploaded video.</p><p>5 0.9749952 <a title="1494-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-25-Paper%3A_High_Performance_Scalable_Data_Stores_.html">784 high scalability-2010-02-25-Paper: High Performance Scalable Data Stores </a></p>
<p>Introduction: The world of scalable databases is not a simple one. They come in every race, creed, and color. Rick Cattell has brought some harmony to that world by publishing  High Performance Scalable Data Stores , a nicely detailed one stop shop paper comparing scalable databases soley on the content of their character. Ironically, the first step in that evaluation is dividing the world into four groups:
  
 Key-value stores: Redis, Scalaris, Voldmort, and Riak. 
 Document stores: Couch DB, MongoDB, and SimpleDB. 
 Record stores: BigTable, HBase, HyperTable, and Cassandra. 
 Scalable RDBMSs: MySQL Cluster, ScaleDB, Drizzle, and VoltDB. 
  
The paper describes each system and then compares them on the dimensions of Concurrency Control, Data Storage Replication, Transaction Model, General Comments, Maturity, K-hits, License Language.
 
And the winner is: there are no winners. Yet. Rick concludes by pointing to a great convergence:

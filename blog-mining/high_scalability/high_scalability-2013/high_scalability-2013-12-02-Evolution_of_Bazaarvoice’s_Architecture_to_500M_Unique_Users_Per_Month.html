[sent-34, score-0.299]
</p><p>2 Thus our initial plan was just to run MySQL replication from our primary managed datacenter and keep enough capacity to serve production traffic in our backup region, on warm-standby. [sent-37, score-0.62]
</p><p>3 In the event that our primary datacenter went down, we would update DNS to point to the backup datacenter. [sent-38, score-0.232]
</p><p>4 For the slave datacenter to truly work during a disaster, we would need to keep enough spare capacity to serve 100% of our production traffic, effectively doubling our hosting costs without adding production capacity. [sent-40, score-0.409]
</p><p>5 Our strategy when building our redundant backup site on EC2 was mostly the same as using a backup datacenter, except that instead of having to pay for ready-to-go servers sitting in a rack, we just needed to have MySQL slaves running. [sent-43, score-0.194]
</p><p>6 However, our experience with using EC2 gave us enough confidence to continue to use it when we decided we wanted to serve live traffic out of both our managed datacenter and Amazon’s us-east-1 region. [sent-48, score-0.588]
</p><p>7 This setup worked well and allowed us to double our production capacity while still giving us the ability to completely fail over to AWS, if ever necessary. [sent-54, score-0.254]
</p><p>8 Soon after, we decided to duplicate our us-east-1 clusters into us-west-2, giving us three live production regions. [sent-55, score-0.345]
</p><p>9 MySQL replication from our managed datacenter to two AWS Regions. [sent-56, score-0.286]
</p><p>10 This gave us one public IP per cluster per region at EC2 and one per cluster at our managed datacenter. [sent-59, score-0.526]
</p><p>11 A side benefit to this is that we could easily take down a region and do rolling deployments, a region at a time, letting DNS handle shifting traffic around. [sent-62, score-0.27]
</p><p>12 Over the years, as we gained thousands of customers and scaled our traffic to billions of pageviews per month, we ended up with hundreds of application servers across 7 clusters running on 3 AWS regions and a managed datacenter. [sent-63, score-0.4]
</p><p>13 Each cluster had a master database with a large chain of slaves across three regions. [sent-64, score-0.245]
</p><p>14 We also had two significant write traffic bottlenecks: the MySQL master running at our managed datacenter and MySQL’s single-threaded replication on all slaves. [sent-67, score-0.378]
</p><p>15 These changes allowed us to go from what was a highly coordinated 8-12 week release cycle to allowing any team to release at any time. [sent-79, score-0.189]
</p><p>16 The Platform Infrastructure team chose to build out AWS in three regions - us-west-2, us-east-1, and eu-west-1 - all within Amazon’s Virtual Private Cloud environment using CloudFormation. [sent-85, score-0.293]
</p><p>17 Nexus: three environments across nine VPCs in three AWS Regions. [sent-89, score-0.212]
</p><p>18 Each VPC used a /20 subnet, divided into three /24 public subnets and three /22 private subnets, utilizing three AZs per VPC. [sent-92, score-0.434]
</p><p>19 The Data Layer     Our Data teams came up with three services for dealing with our massive dataset, all optimized for developer productivity and ease of management. [sent-102, score-0.289]
</p><p>20 Using these AWS services enables teams to build their services much more quickly than before. [sent-122, score-0.25]

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear?

This post is introduced by  Andy Gelfond , TripAdvisor’s head of engineering.   It's been a little over a year since our last post about the  TripAdvisor architecture . It has been an exciting year. Our business and team continues to grow, we are now an independent public company, and we have continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown - we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:
  
 56M visitors per month 
 350M+ pages requests a day 
 120TB+ of warehouse data running on a large Hadoop cluster, and quickly growing 
  
We also had a very successful college intern program that brought on over 60 interns this past summer, all who were quickly on boarded and doing the same kind of work a</p><p>4 0.16629894 <a title="1557-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-19-LinkedIn%3A_Creating_a_Low_Latency_Change_Data_Capture_System_with_Databus.html">1211 high scalability-2012-03-19-LinkedIn: Creating a Low Latency Change Data Capture System with Databus</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Siddharth Anand , a senior member of LinkedIn's Distributed Data Systems team.  
 
Over the past 3 years, I've had the good fortune to work with many emerging NoSQL products in the context of  supporting the needs of a high-traffic, customer facing web site.
 
In 2010, I helped Netflix to successfully   transition its web scale use-cases from Oracle to SimpleDB  , AWS' hosted database service. On completion of that migration, we started a second migration, this time from SimpleDB to Cassandra. The first transition was key to our move from our own data center to AWS' cloud. The second was key to our expansion from one AWS Region to multiple geographically-distributed Regions -- today Netflix serves traffic out of two AWS Regions, one in Virginia, the other in Ireland ( F1 ). Both of these transitions have been successful, but have involved integration pain points such as the creation of database replication technology.

<p>Introduction: Authored by  Chris Fregly   :  Former Netflix Streaming Platform Engineer, AWS Certified Solution Architect and Purveyor of fluxcapacitor.com.  
   Ahead of the upcoming 2nd annual re:Invent conference, inspired by Simone Brunozzi’s recent    presentation    at an AWS Meetup in San Francisco, and collected from a few of my recent    Fluxcapacitor.com    consulting engagements, I’ve compiled a list of 10 useful time and clock-tick saving tips about AWS. 
    1) Query AWS resource metadata  
      
   Can’t remember the EBS-Optimized IO throughput of your c1.xlarge cluster?  How about the size limit of an S3 object on a single PUT?     awsnow.info    is the answer to all of your AWS-resource metadata questions.  Interested in integrating awsnow.info with your application?  You’re in luck.  There’s now a    REST API   , as well! 
   Note:  These are default soft limits and will vary by account. 
    2) Tame your S3 buckets  
       
   Delete an entire S3 bucket with a single CLI command:</p><p>6 0.15842977 <a title="1557-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-27-TripAdvisor_Architecture_-_40M_Visitors%2C_200M_Dynamic_Page_Views%2C_30TB_Data.html">1068 high scalability-2011-06-27-TripAdvisor Architecture - 40M Visitors, 200M Dynamic Page Views, 30TB Data</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a part interview part guest with Sebastian Stadil, founder of  Scalr , a cheaper open-source version of RightScale. Scalr takes care of all the web site infrastructure bits to on Amazon (and other clouds) so you don’t have to.
 
I first met Sebastian at one of the original Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Group meetups, a group which he founded. The meetings started in the tiny offices of Intalio where Sebastian was working with this new fangled Amazon thing to create an auto-scaling server farm on EC2. I remember distinctly how Sebastian met everyone at the door with a handshake and a smile, making us all feel welcome. Later I took one of the classes he  created on how to use AWS. I guess he figured all this cloud stuff was going somewhere and decided to start Scalr.
 
My only regret about this post is that the name Amazon does not begin with the letter ‘S’, that would have made for an epic title.

<p>Introduction: Amazon is fixing two of their major problems: no static IP addresses and single datacenter operation. By adding these two new features developers can finally build a no apology system on Amazon. Before you always had to throw in an apology or two. No, we don't have low failover times because of the silly DNS games and unexceptionable DNS update and propagation times and no, we don't operate in more than one datacenter. No more. Now Amazon is adding   Elastic IP Addresses   and   Availability Zones  .     Elastic IP addresses are far better than normal IP addresses because they are both in tight with   Jessica Alba   and they are:        Static IP addresses designed for dynamic cloud computing. An Elastic IP address is associated with your account, not a particular instance, and you control that address until you choose to explicitly release it. Unlike traditional static IP addresses, however, Elastic IP addresses allow you to mask instance or availability zone failures by programmatica</p><p>4 0.79083592 <a title="1557-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-05-A_Simple_6_Step_Transition_Guide_for_Moving_Away_from_X_to_AWS_.html">1470 high scalability-2013-06-05-A Simple 6 Step Transition Guide for Moving Away from X to AWS </a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you just want to visit Rome and not go full on Cloud Native like Netflix, then  Soundslice 's  Adrian Holovaty  in  Why I left Heroku, and notes on my new AWS setup  provides a simple guide for helping make your first trip a good one.
 
First, let's dispose of why Soundslice left Heroku. The essence is because of various issues "Heroku lost my trust." YMMV, but once a fact, what do you do?
 
After a consultation with  Scott VanDenPlas , former director of dev ops for the Obama reelection tech team, they came up a simple transition guide that I think is quite good and generally useful (full details in the  original post ): 
  
  Bake an AMI . Install all the stuff you need on an AMI and use that as your deployment unit. This works well for Netflix and for users who value a certain sort of simplicity more than flexibility. There were a lot of comments saying how it's better to use Chef/Puppet and configure instances on the fly, but there's a confidence that only a baked image provides</p><p>5 0.78698301 <a title="1557-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-03-The_%E2%80%9CFour_Hamiltons%E2%80%9D_Framework_for_Mitigating_Faults_in_the_Cloud%3A_Avoid_it%2C_Mask_it%2C_Bound_it%2C_Fix_it_Fast.html">1604 high scalability-2014-03-03-The “Four Hamiltons” Framework for Mitigating Faults in the Cloud: Avoid it, Mask it, Bound it, Fix it Fast</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Patrick Eaton , Software Engineer and Distributed Systems Architect at Stackdriver. 
 
Stackdriver provides intelligent monitoring-as-a-service for cloud hosted applications.  Behind this easy-to-use service is a large distributed system for collecting and storing metrics and events, monitoring and alerting on them, analyzing them, and serving up all the results in a web UI.  Because we ourselves run in the cloud (mostly on AWS), we spend a lot of time thinking about how to deal with faults in the cloud.  We have developed a framework for thinking about fault mitigation for large, cloud-hosted systems.  We endearingly call this framework the “Four Hamiltons” because it is inspired by an article from James Hamilton, the Vice President and Distinguished Engineer at Amazon Web Services.
   The article that led to this framework is called “   The Power Failure Seen Around the World   ”  .  Hamilton analyzes the causes of the power outage that affected Super Bowl XL</p><p>6 0.78488564 <a title="1557-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-21-Pixable_Architecture_-_Crawling%2C_Analyzing%2C_and_Ranking_20_Million_Photos_a_Day.html">1197 high scalability-2012-02-21-Pixable Architecture - Crawling, Analyzing, and Ranking 20 Million Photos a Day</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post written by    Victor Trac   , Cloud Architect at    Bazaarvoice   .  
   Bazaarvoice is a company that people interact with on a regular basis but have probably never heard of. If you read customer reviews on sites like bestbuy.com, nike.com, or walmart.com, you are using Bazaarvoice services. These sites, along with thousands of others, rely on Bazaarvoice to supply the software and technology to collect and display user conversations about products and services. All of this means that Bazaarvoice processes a lot of sentiment data on most of the products we all use daily. 
     Bazaarvoice helps our clients make better products by using a combination of machine learning and natural language processing to extract useful information and user sentiments from the millions of free-text reviews that go through our platform. This data gets boiled down into reports that clients can use to improve their products and services. We are also starting to look at how to show per</p><p>2 0.94460511 <a title="1557-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-04-Jim_Starkey_is_Creating_a_Brave_New_World_by_Rethinking_Databases_for_the_Cloud.html">1092 high scalability-2011-08-04-Jim Starkey is Creating a Brave New World by Rethinking Databases for the Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jim Starkey , founder of  NuoDB , in this  thread  on the Cloud Computing group, delivers a  masterful post  on why he thinks the relational model is the best overall compromise amongst the different options, why NewSQL can free itself from the limitations of legacy SQL architectures, and how this creates a brave new lock free world.... 
 
I'll  [Jim Starkey]  go into more detail later in the post for those who care, but the executive summary goes like this:  Network latency is relatively high and human attention span is relatively low.  So human facing computer systems have to perform their work in a small number of trips between the client and the database server.  But the human condition leads inexorably to data complexity.  There are really only two strategies to manage this problem. One is to use coarse granularity storage, glombing together related data into a single blob and letting intelligence on the client make sense of it.  The other is storing fine granularity data on the s</p><p>3 0.92621511 <a title="1557-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-08-Cloud_AWS_Infrastructure_vs._Physical_Infrastructure.html">853 high scalability-2010-07-08-Cloud AWS Infrastructure vs. Physical Infrastructure</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Frédéric Faure   (architect at  Ysance )  on the differences between using a cloud infrastructure and building your own. Frédéric was kind enough to translate the original French version of this article into English. 
 
I’ve been noticing many questions about the differences inherent in choosing between a Cloud infrastructure such as  AWS  (Amazon Web Services) and a traditional physical infrastructure. Firstly, there are a certain number of preconceived notions on this subject that I will attempt to decode for you. Then, it must be understood that each infrastructure has its advantages and disadvantages: a Cloud-type infrastructure does not necessarily fulfill your requirements in every case, however, it can satisfy some of them by optimizing or facilitating the features offered by a traditional physical infrastructure. I will therefore demonstrate the differences between the two that I have noticed, in order to help you make up your own mind.

<p>Introduction: In the scalability is specialization department here is an interesting paper presented at  HotNets '13  on high performance networking:  Network Stack Specialization for Performance .
 
The idea is generalizing a service so it fits in the kernel comes at a high performance cost. So move TCP into user space.  The result is a web server with ~3.5x the throughput of Nginx "while experiencing low CPU utilization, linear scaling on multicore systems, and saturating current NIC hardware."
 
Here's a good description of the paper published  on Layer 9 :
  Traditionally, servers and OSes have been built to be general purpose. However now we have a high degree of specialization. In fact, in a big web service, you might have thousands of machines dedicated to one function. Therefore, there's scope for specialization. This paper looks at a specific opportunity in that space. Network stacks today are good for high throughput with large transfers, but not small files (which are common in web browsi</p><p>5 0.92048347 <a title="1557-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-07-Hypertable_Routs_HBase_in_Performance_Test_--_HBase_Overwhelmed_by_Garbage_Collection.html">1189 high scalability-2012-02-07-Hypertable Routs HBase in Performance Test -- HBase Overwhelmed by Garbage Collection</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Doug Judd , original creator of Hypertable and the CEO of Hypertable, Inc. 
 
 Hypertable delivers 2X better throughput in most tests -- HBase fails 41 and 167 billion record insert tests, overwhelmed by garbage collection -- Both systems deliver similar results for random read uniform test 
 
We recently conducted a test comparing the performance of Hypertable ( @hypertable ) version 0.9.5.5 to that of HBase ( @HBase ) version 0.90.4 (CDH3u2) running Zookeeper 3.3.4.  In this post, we summarize the results and offer explanations for the discrepancies. For the full test report, see  Hypertable vs. HBase II .
  Introduction  
Hypertable and HBase are both open source, scalable databases modeled after Google's proprietary Bigtable database.  The primary difference between the two systems is that Hypertable is written in C++, while HBase is written in Java.  We modeled this test after the one described in section 7 of the  Bigtable paper  and tuned both systems fo</p><p>6 0.91551441 <a title="1557-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-05-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_5%2C_2011.html">1093 high scalability-2011-08-05-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 5, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There has been a lot of speculation over how Apple'siCloudwould work. With the
Apple Worldwide Developers Conferencekeynotes having just completed, we
finally learned the truth. We can handle it. They made some interesting and
cost effective architecture choices that preserved the value of their devices
and the basic model of how their existing services work.A lot of pundits
foretold that with all the datacenters Apple was building we would get a
streaming music solution. Only one copy of music would be stored and then
streamed on demand to everyone. Or they could go the Google brute force method
and copy up all a user's music and play it on demand.Apple did neither. The
chose an interesting middle path that's not Google, Amazon, or even
MobileMe.They key idea is you no longer need a PC. Device content is now
synced over the air and is managed by the cloud, not your legacy computer.
Your data may not even be stored in the cloud, but the whole management,
syncing, and control of content</p><p>3 0.12106113 <a title="1524-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-09-Apple%27s_iPhone_to_Use_a_Centralized_Push_Based_Notification_Architecture.html">343 high scalability-2008-06-09-Apple's iPhone to Use a Centralized Push Based Notification Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2: Hank Williams saysiPhone Background Processing: Not Fixed But
Halfway There. Excellent analysis of all the reasons you need real background
processing. Hey, you can't even build an alarm clock! Hard to believe some
commenters say it's not so..Update: Josh Lowensohn of Webware tells usWhy
users should be scared of Apple's new notification system.A big item on the
iPhone developer iWishlist has been background processing. If you can't write
an app to poll for new data in the background how will you keep your even more
important non-foreground app in sync? Live from the Apple developer conference
we learn the solution is a centralized push based architecture.Here's the
relevant MacRumorsLive transcript:Thanking the developers for their hard work.
Now talking about how the #1 request has been background support. Apple wants
to solve this problem.The wrong solution would be to allow for background
processes -- bad for battery life and performance. Poking fun at Windows

<p>Introduction: Performance guruSteve Souders gave his keynote presentation, Cache is King!
(slides), at the HTML5DevCon, besides being an extremely clear explanation of
how caching works on the Internet and how to optimize your use of HTTP to get
the best performance, Steve ran experiments that found some surprising results
on what gave the best web site performance improvements.In his base line test,
page loads took 7.65 seconds (median of three runs). What change--Fast
Network, No Javascript, or Primed Cache--would make the biggest performance
improvement? It was Primed Cache.Fast Network - Using a fast FIOS network the
load time was 4.13 seconds. Steve was surprised how big a difference this
made, given how much work must happen in the browser. No JavaScript - 4.74
seconds after disabling JavaScript. Both reduces transfers and skips parsing
by the browser. Steve thought the effect would have been larger.Primed Cache-

<p>Introduction: In a really far ranging and insightful interview by Steve Peterson: Game
Industry Legends: Rob Pardo, where the future of gaming is discussed, there
was a section on how the cloud might be used in games. I know there are a lot
of game developers in my audience, so I thought it might be useful:Q. If the
game is free-to-play but I have to download 10 gigabytes to try it out, that
can keep me from trying it. That's part of what cloud gaming is trying to
overcome; do you think cloud gaming is going to make some inroads because of
those technical issues? Rob Pardo: I certainly think there's a lot of
potential in cloud gaming, it's just picking the right games. There's a lot of
hurdles for cloud gaming to overcome, one of which is having to have all these
servers to be able to host all these games, since it's not like you need any
less computing power to play these games. First of all you need someone with
the infrastructure that can have all those games up there. Another issue the

<p>Introduction: Wired has awonderful interview with Clayton Christensen, author of the tech
ninja's bible, Innovator's Dilemma. Innovation is the name of the game in
Silicon Valley and if you want to understand the rules of the game this
article is a quick and clear way of learning. Everything is simply explained
with compelling examples by the man himself.Just as every empire has fallen,
every organization is open to disruption. It's the human condition to become
comfortable and discount potential dangers. It takes a great deal of
mindfulness to outwit and outlast the human condition. If you want to be the
disruptor and avoid being the disruptee, this is good stuff.He also talks
about his new book,The Capitalist's Dilemma, which addresses this puzzle: if
corporations are doing so well why are individuals doing so bad?If someone can
help you see a deep meaningful pattern in life then they haven't brought you a
fish, they've taught you how to fish. That's what Christensen does. Here's a

<p>Introduction: Update:As expected I'm undergoing a massive spam attack for speaking truth to
dark powers. This is the time to be strong. Together we can make a change.
What change you may ask? I can't say, just change and lots more change. Let's
link arms together and bravely stand against the forces of chaos for a better
yesterday and a better tomorrow.CAPTCHA doesn't work. Even Google can't make
CAPTCHA work (Spammers Choose GMail). And even if CAPTCHA worked it wouldn't
really work because CAPTCHA solving markets (Inside India's CAPTCHA solving
economy) have evolved where for a mere $2 you can buy 1000 human broken
CAPTCHA's. And we know once the free market tackles a problem that's it. Game
over :-)Making ever more clever CAPTCHA programs won't outwit and outlast the
CAPTCHA solving markets. Until Skynet evolves the only way to defeat humans is
with humans.Using Games to Get Humans to Do Work (like CAPTCHA) for FreeHow do

<p>Introduction: When two titans of the early computing industry, Apple co-founder Steve
Wozniakand Atari founderNolan Bushnell, had a chance to sit down for a chat at
the C2SVconference last Friday, we learned how a little foresight and luck can
decide futures.  Steve Wozniak's Success - Expandability  Steve talked about
how the Apple II was the primary source of revenue for Apple's first 10 years
of life. The reason the Apple II could last so long was that it was
expandable. It hadeight expansion slotsand the RAM was also expandable
(starting at 4K). No computer at the time had this kind of flexibility
orexpansion capabilities. Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs argued over keeping the
Apple II open. Jobs wanted closed, Wozniak wanted open and fortunately Wozniak
won.  In fact, the Apple II was completely open (those were the days). They
published the complete specs before there was anything like a developer
community. So even though the Apple III, Lisa, and the Macintosh all failed,
the Apple II kept roll</p><p>2 0.74037105 <a title="1524-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-13-A_Note_on_How_to_Create_Teasers_When_Posting_.html">210 high scalability-2008-01-13-A Note on How to Create Teasers When Posting </a></p>
<p>Introduction: I fully and enthusiastically encourage anyone who wants to share a relevant
topic to register and post. People have added a lot of good and useful
content. Don't be shy. It's been asked how a teaser is created when posting so
the full article doesn't display on the front page. A teaser is a paragraph
interesting enough to convince readers to click on the "read more" link to get
the full article.breakCreating a teaser in Drupal is accomplished by inserting
< ! -- break -- > on a separate line directly after the text you want to be
the teaser. Only DO NOT include the spaces. So your post looks like:Teaser

kludgey, but it works.</p><p>3 0.69475621 <a title="1524-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-30-MySQL_clustering_strategies_and_comparisions.html">196 high scalability-2007-12-30-MySQL clustering strategies and comparisions</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Rodrigo Guzman, CTO ofiDoneThis, which makes status
reporting happen at your company with the lightest possible touch.iDoneThisis
a simple management application that emails your team at the end of every day
to ask, "What'd you get done today?" Just reply with a few lines of what you
got done. The following morning everyone on your team gets a digest with what
the team accomplished the previous day to keep everyone in the loop and
kickstart another awesome day.Before we launched, we built iDoneThis over a
weekend in the most rudimentary way possible. I kid you not, we sent the first
few batches of daily emails using the BCC field of a Gmail inbox. The upshot
is that we've had users on the site from Day 3 of its existence on.We've gone
from launch in January 2011 when we sent hundreds of emails out per day by
hand to sending out over 1 million emails and handling over 200,000 incoming
emails per month. In total, customers have recorded over 1.7 million

room of #BigData the must be a pony in here somewhere!@adron: #ricon2012 OH
"it isn't cloud, nosql or whatever, it's distributed systems... That is the
change!" Smartest thing stated at a conf in ages.@justinesherry: First lesson
watching @eric_brewer's keynote at #ricon2012 -- distributed systems make you
go bald. (Both audience and speaker!)@adron: OH "What's the hello world of
distributed systems?" "Twitter."Mikael Ronstrom: A long career on distributed
systems has learnt me that it is extremely important to do proper partitioning
of data sets to achieve scalability on network level. But it is still
extremely important to make each node in the distributed system as large as
possible. Greg Linden: Surprising: "It can be three to four times the cost for
the retailer to pick items and pack them from a store versus having a really
efficient, automated process back in a distribution center."Dan Rayburn: CDNs

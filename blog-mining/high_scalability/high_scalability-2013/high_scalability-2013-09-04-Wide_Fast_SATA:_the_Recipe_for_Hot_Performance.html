flash memory are staggering.If you're not using SSD, you are doing it wrong.
Not quite true, but close. Some small applications fit entirely in memory -
less than 100GB - great for in-memory solutions. There's a place for
rotational drives (HDD) in massive streaming analytics and petabytes of data.
But for the vast space between, flash has become the only sensible option. For
example, the Samsung 840 costs $180 for 250GB. The speed rating for this drive
is rated by the manufacturer at 96,000 random 4K read IOPS, and 61,000 random
4K write IOPS. The Samsung 840 is not alone at this price performance. A 300GB
Intel 320 is $450. An OCZ Vertex 4 256GB is $235, with the Intel being rated
as slowest, but our internal testing showing solid performance. Most

<p>Introduction: With Amazonannouncing new High I/O 2TB SSD instancesthe age of SSD has almost
arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on
demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on
demand rate theprice per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:27 cents
($27K/100K IOPS) per vs$1.25 for disk.With the obvious benefits of giant SSD
machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it's interesting to consider: what
architecture decisions might you make differently in the future?More Headroom

performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows
developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This

architectures as a software thing, but it also applies to hardware. InSecurity
Now 385, that Doyen of Disk,Steve Gibson, tells the fascinating story (@ about
41:30) of how moving to a service oriented architecture in hard drives,
modeling a drive as a linear stream of sectors, helped create the amazing high
density disk drives we enjoy today.When drives switched to use
theIDE(integrated drive electronics) interface, the controller function moved
into the drive instead of the computer. No longer were low level drive signals
moved across cables and into the motherboard. Now we just ask the drive for
the desired sector and the drive takes care of it.This allowed manufacturers
to do anything they wanted to behind the IDE interface. The drive stopped
being dumb, it became smart, providing a sort of sector service. Density sky
rocketed because there was no dependency on the computer. All the internals

<p>Introduction: Planning your next buildout and thinking SSDs are still far in the future?
Still too expensive, too low density. Hard disks are cheap, familiar, and
store lots of stuff. In this short and entertaining video Wikia's Artur
Bergmanwants to change your mind about SSDs. SSDs are for today, get with the
math already.Here's Artur's logic:Wikia is all SSD in production. The new
Wikia file servers have a theoretical read rate of ~10GB/sec sequential,
6GB/sec random and 1.2 million IOPs. If you can't do math or love the past,
you love spinning rust. If you are awesome you love SSDs.SSDs are cheaper than
drives using the most relevant metric: $/GB/IOPS. 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS and one
hard drive is 180 IOPS. Need 1 SSD instead of 50 hard drives.With 8 million
files there's a 9 minute fsck. Full backup in 12 minutes (X-25M based).4

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byBrian Bulkowski, CTO and co-founder ofAerospike, a
leading clustered NoSQL database, has worked in the area of high performance
commodity systems since 1989.This blog post will tell you exactly how to build
a multi-terabyte high throughput datacenter server. A fast, reliable multi-
terrabyte data tier can be used for recent behavior (messages, tweets, plays,
actions), or anywhere that today you use Redis or Memcache.You need to
know:Which SSDs workWhich chassis workHow to configure your RAID cardsIntel's
SATA solutions - combined with a high capacity storage server like the Dell
R720xd and a host bus adapter based on the LSI 2208, and a Flash optimized
database likeAerospike, enables high throughput and low latency.In a wide
configuration, with 12 to 20 drives per 2U server, individual servers can
cost-effectively serve at high throughput with 16T at $2.50 per GB with the
s3700, or $1.25 with the s3500. Other SSD offerings - from Crucial (Micron)

<p>Introduction: Sean Hullwith two helpful posts:5 Things That are Toxic to Scalability:Object
Relational Mappers.Create complex queries that hard to optimize and
tweak.Synchronous, Serial, Coupled or Locking Processes.Locks are like stop
signs, traffic circles keep the traffic flowing. Row level locking is better
than table level locking. Use async replication. Use eventual consistency for
clusters.One Copy of Your Database.A single database server is a choke point.
Create parallel databases and let a driver select between them.Having No
Metrics.Visualize what's happening to your system using one of the many
monitoring packages.Lack of Feature Flags.Be able to turn off features via a
flag so when a spike hits features can be turned off to reduce load.3 Ways to
Boost Cloud Scalability:Use Auto-scaling.Spin-up new instances when a
threshold is passed and back down again when traffic drops.Horizontally Scale

<p>Introduction: Harish Ganesan CTO of8KMiles has a very helpful blog, Cloud, Big Data and
Mobile, where he shows a nice analytical bent which leads to a lot of
practical advice and cost saving tips:Use SQS Batch Requests to reduce the
number of requests hitting SQS which saves costs. Sending 10 messages in a
single batch request which in the example save $30/month.Use SQS Long Polling
to reduce extra polling requests, cutting down empty receives, which in the
example saves ~$600 in empty receive leakage costs.Choose the right search
technology choice to save costs in AWS by matching your activity pattern to
the technology. For a small application with constant load or a heavily
utilized search tier or seasonal loads Amazon Cloud Search looks like the cost
efficient play. Use Amazon CloudFront Price Class to minimize costs by
selecting the right Price Class for your audience to potentially reduce
delivery costs by excluding Amazon CloudFront's more expensive edge
locations.Optimize ElastiCache Cluster</p><p>4 0.80542338 <a title="1511-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-23-This_stuff_isn%27t_taught%2C_you_learn_it_bit_by_bit_as_you_solve_each_problem..html">994 high scalability-2011-02-23-This stuff isn't taught, you learn it bit by bit as you solve each problem.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: "For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing
them." -- AristotleA really nice Internet moment happened in the HackerNews
thread Disqus: Scaling the World's Largest Django Application, when David
Kitchen crafted an awesome responseto a questionabout how you learn to build
scalable systems. It's so good I thought I would reproduce it
here.Question:asked by grovulent:Not like this is a problem I have to worry
about. But where on earth does one learn this stuff? The talk is useful - as
an overview of what they use - but I know nothing of how to implement a single
step.Answer: answered by David Kitchenofburo9:It's called experience. Which
perhaps sounds rude, but it's not meant to be.This stuff isn't taught per se,
you learn it bit by bit as you solve each problem that you face.I learned
about HAProxy when my site load exceeded that which a single web server could
manage.I learned about heartbeat when I had to update my HAProxy and it
knocked the site offline.I</p><p>5 0.78572583 <a title="1511-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-19-Papers%3A_Readings_in_Distributed_Systems.html">497 high scalability-2009-01-19-Papers: Readings in Distributed Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Marton Trencseni has collected a wonderful list of different papers on
distributed systems. He's organized them into the following sections: The
Google Papers, Distributed Filesystems, Non-relational Distributed Databases,
The Lamport Papers, and Implementation Issues. Many old favorites on the list
and some that are likely new to you. My new favorite is "Frangipani: A
Scalable Distributed File System." How can you not love "Frangipani" as a
word?</p><p>6 0.77678543 <a title="1511-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-06-Product%3A_Perdition_Mail_Retrieval_Proxy.html">80 high scalability-2007-09-06-Product: Perdition Mail Retrieval Proxy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Now that we have theC10K concurrent connection problemlicked, how do we level
up and support 10 million concurrent connections? Impossible you say. Nope,
systems right now are delivering 10 million concurrent connections using
techniques that are as radical as they may be unfamiliar.To learn how it's
done we turn toRobert Graham, CEO of Errata Security, and his absolutely
fantastic talk atShmoocon 2013calledC10M Defending The Internet At
Scale.Robert has a brilliant way of framing the problem that I've never heard
of before. He starts with a little bit of history, relating how Unix wasn't
originally designed to be a general server OS, it was designed to be a control
system for a telephone network. It was the telephone network that actually
transported the data so there was a clean separation between the control plane
and the data plane. Theproblem is we now use Unix servers as part of the data
plane, which we shouldn't do at all. If we were designing a kernel for
handling one applicati</p><p>4 0.15371008 <a title="1550-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-22-How_many_machines_do_you_need_to_run_your_site%3F.html">70 high scalability-2007-08-22-How many machines do you need to run your site?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Moshe Kaplan of RockeTiershows the life cycle of an affiliate marketing
systemthat starts off as a cub handling one million events per day and ends up
a lion handling 200 million to even one billion events per day. The resulting
system uses ten commodity servers at a cost of $35,000.Mr. Kaplan's paper is
especially interesting because it documents a system architecture evolution we
may see a lot more of in the future:database centric --> cache centric -->
memory grid.As scaling and performance requirements for complicated operations
increase, leaving the entire system in memory starts to make a great deal of
sense. Why use cache at all? Why shouldn't your system be all in memory from
the start?General Approach to Evolving the System to ScaleAnalyze the system
architecture and the main business processes. Detect the main hardware

learnt tracking a billion events in 24 hours: Know your host, Scaling isn't
just servers, My servers need to talk to me more, Kill switches for users,
What you don't know is the problem, Don't mix server roles, Know your most
important users outside of your site.Tweets of Gold:georgebarnett: I read High

out approach and finds scale up wanting. The discussion in the comments is as
interesting as the article. My guess is Markus doesn't want to rewrite his
software to work across a scale out cluster so even if it's more expensive
scale up works better for his needs.Update 3:POF now has 200 million imagesand
serves 10,000 images served per second. They'll be moving to a 250,000 IOPS
RamSan to handle the load. Also upgraded to a core database machine with 512

<p>Introduction: Other thanStackOverflow, PlentyOfFish is perhaps the most spectacular example
of scale-up architectures working for what your average sane person would
consider a large system. It doesn't hurt that it's also a sexy story.Update
5:PlentyOfFish Update - 6 Billion Pageviews And 32 Billion Images A
MonthUpdate 4:Jeff Atwoodcosts out Markus' scale up approach against a scale
out approach and finds scale up wanting. The discussion in the comments is as
interesting as the article. My guess is Markus doesn't want to rewrite his
software to work across a scale out cluster so even if it's more expensive
scale up works better for his needs.Update 3:POF now has 200 million imagesand
serves 10,000 images served per second. They'll be moving to a 250,000 IOPS
RamSan to handle the load. Also upgraded to a core database machine with 512
GB of RAM, 32 CPU's, SQLServer 2008 and Windows 2008.Update 2: This seems to
be aPOF Peer1 love fest infomercial. It's pretty content free, but the

<p>Introduction: And now for something completely different, brought to you by David Ackley and
Daniel Cannon in their playfully thought provoking paper: Pursue robust
indefinite scalability, wherein they try to take a fresh look at neural
networks, starting from scratch.What is this strange thing calledindefinite
scalability? They sound like words that don't really go together:Indefinite
scalability is the property that the design can support open-ended
computational growth without substantial re-engineering, in as strict as sense
as can be managed. By comparison, many computer, algorithm, and network
designs -- even those that address scalability -- are only finitely scalable
because their scalability occurs within some finite space. For example, an in-
core sorting algorithm for a 32 bit machine can only scale to billions of
numbers before address space is exhausted and then that algorithm must be re-
engineered.Our idea is to expose indefinitely scalable computational power to
programmers using rei</p><p>2 0.94951743 <a title="1550-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-31-NSFW%3A_Hilarious_Fault-Tolerance_Cartoon_.html">667 high scalability-2009-07-31-NSFW: Hilarious Fault-Tolerance Cartoon </a></p>

<p>Introduction: In 1999 Dan Kegel issued a big hairy audacious challenge to web servers:It's
time for web servers to handle ten thousand clients simultaneously, don't you
think? After all, the web is a big place now.This became known as theC10K
problem. Engineers solved the C10K scalability problems by fixing OS kernels
and moving away from threaded servers like Apache to event-driven servers like
Nginx and Node.Today we are considering an even bigger goal, how to support10
Million Concurrent Connections, which requires even more radical techniques.No
similar challenge was issued for managing servers in a datacenter, but
according toDave Nearyfrom Red Hat, in a recentFLOSS Weekly episode, we have
passed the 10K barrier for server management with 10,000 or more servers
managed per sysadmin.Should we let this milestone pass without
mention?Absolutely not! It's a stunning accomplishment with 200x-2000x
increases in productivity. Dave said he remembered in the 1990s it took one
sysadmin to manage 4 or 5 W</p><p>4 0.92274511 <a title="1550-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-05-Intercloud%3A_How_Will_We_Scale_Across_Multiple_Clouds%3F.html">803 high scalability-2010-04-05-Intercloud: How Will We Scale Across Multiple Clouds?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: InA Brief History of the Internetit was revealed that the Internet wasbased on
the idea that there would be multiple independent networks of rather arbitrary
design. The Internet as we now know it embodies a key underlying technical
idea, namely that of open architecture networking. In this approach, the
choice of any individual network technology was not dictated by a particular
network architecture but rather could be selected freely by a provider and
made to interwork with the other networks through a meta-level
"Internetworking Architecture".  With the cloud we are in the same situation
today, just a layer or two higher up the stack. We have independent clouds
that we would like to connect and work seamlessly together, preferably with
the ease at which we currently connect nodes to a network and networks to the
Internet. This technology seems to be called theIntercloud: an interconnected
global "cloud ofclouds" as apposed to theInternetwhich is a "network of
networks."Vinton Cerf,p</p><p>5 0.91531485 <a title="1550-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

not complicated. [There's] just a lot of it." \--Richard Feynmanon how the

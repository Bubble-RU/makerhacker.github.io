</p><p>3 If an event can not be dispatched quickly, by message type or other data in the message, then event should be queued to a '''digester''' object at a high priority so the event can be correctly prioritized based on more complicated calculations. [sent-122, score-1.005]
</p><p>4 The scheduling algorithm supports multiple priorities so high priority work gets process first, quotas at each priority for fairness, and CPU limitation. [sent-123, score-1.546]
</p><p>5 It may still be necessary to be able to interrupt low priority work with a  flag when high priority work comes in. [sent-170, score-1.46]

</p><p>12 Each backplane has priority based ready queues that are quota controlled. [sent-303, score-1.013]
</p><p>13 Lower priority work is scheduled when there is no higher priority work or higher priority work has met its quota. [sent-309, score-2.444]
</p><p>14 When lower priority work has been assigned to a thread higher priority work can come in. [sent-310, score-1.795]
</p><p>15 The lower priority work's task may not be scheduled because a higher priority task is executing elsewhere in the system. [sent-311, score-1.433]
</p><p>16 The lower priority work is causing the higher priority work not to execute, even if the higher priority work would run at a task priority higher than the currently running task that is blocking the lower priority work from running. [sent-314, score-4.001]
</p><p>17 By upping the task priority of the lower priority work's task to that of the higher priority work's task priority we give the lower priority work a chance to run so it can complete and let the higher priority work run. [sent-315, score-4.12]
</p><p>18 The lower priority work can run to completion or it can use global flags to know if it should exit its function as soon as possible so the higher priority work can run. [sent-316, score-1.621]
</p><p>19 The priority inheritance works across backplanes so high priority work in any backplane will not block on lower priority work in any other backplane. [sent-317, score-2.445]
</p><p>20 Even if the lower priority work doesn't not give up the critical section immediately, just giving it a chance to run will make it so the higher  priority work can get scheduled sooner. [sent-319, score-1.691]

<p>Introduction: There's not a lot  of talk about application architectures at the process level. You have your threads, pools of threads, and you have your callback models. That's about it. Languages/frameworks making a virtue out of simple models, like Go and Erlang, do so at the price of control. It's difficult to make a low latency well conditioned application when a power full tool, like work scheduling, is taken out of the hands of the programmer.
 
But that's not all there is my friend. We'll dive into different ways an application can be composed across threads of control.
 
Your favorite language may not give you access to all the capabilities we are going to talk about, but lately there has been a sort of revival in considering performance important, especially for controlling  latency variance , so I think it's time to talk about these kind of issues.

<p>Introduction: For solutions take a look at:  7 Life Saving Scalability Defenses Against Load Monster Attacks . 
 
This is a look at all the bad things that can happen to your carefully crafted program as loads increase: all hell breaks lose. Sure, you can scale out or scale up, but you can also choose to program better. Make your system handle larger loads. This saves money because fewer boxes are needed and it will make the entire application more reliable and have better response times. And it can be quite satisfying as a programmer.
  Large Number Of Objects  
We usually get into scaling problems when the number of objects gets  larger. Clearly resource usage of all types is stressed as the number of objects grow.
  Continuous Failures Makes An Infinite Event Stream  
During large network failure scenarios there is never time for the system recover. We are in a continual state of stress.
  Lots of High Priority Work  
For example, rerouting is a high priority activity. If there is a large amount</p><p>4 0.3620787 <a title="1429-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-06-Low_Level_Scalability_Solutions_-_The_Aggregation_Collection.html">1418 high scalability-2013-03-06-Low Level Scalability Solutions - The Aggregation Collection</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What good are problems without solutions? In  42 Monster Problems That Attack As Loads Increase  we talked about problems. In this first post (OK, there was an earlier post, but I'm doing some reorganizing), we'll cover what I call  aggregation  strategies.
 
Keep in mind these are low level architecture type suggestions of how to structure the components of your code and how they interact. We're not talking about massive scale-out clusters here, but of what your applications might like like internally, way below the service level interface level. There's a lot more to the world than evented architectures.
 
Aggregation simply means we aren't using stupid queues. Our queues will be smart. We are deeply aware of queues as containers of work that eventually dictate how the entire system performs. As work containers we know intimately what requests and data sit in our queues and we can use that intelligence to our great advantage.
  Prioritize Work

<p>Introduction: We talked about  42 Monster Problems That Attack As Loads Increase . And in  The Aggregation Collection  we talked about the value of prioritizing work and making smart queues as a way of absorbing and not reflecting traffic spikes.
 
Now we move on to our next batch of strategies where the theme is  conditioning , which is the idea of shaping and controlling flows of work within your application...
  Use Resources Proportional To a Fixed Limit  
This is probably the most important rule for achieving scalability within an application. What it means:
  
 Find the resource that has a fixed limit that you know you can support. For example, a guarantee to handle a certain number of objects in memory. So if we always use resources proportional to the number of objects it is likely we can prevent resource exhaustion. 
 Devise ways of tying what you need to do to the individual resources. 
  
Some examples:

How do you structure your application? That’s the question I explored in the article  Beyond Threads And Callbacks . An option I did not talk about, mostly because of my own ignorance, is a powerful stack you may not be all that familiar with: Scala and Akka.
   To remedy my oversight is our acting tour guide, Typesafe’s Viktor Klang, long time Scala hacker and Java enterprise systems architect. Viktor was very patient in answering my questions and was enthusiastic about sharing his knowledge. He’s a guy who definitely knows what he is talking about.

Now we move on to our next batch of strategies where the theme is  conditioning , which is the idea of shaping and controlling flows of work within your application...
  Use Resources Proportional To a Fixed Limit  
This is probably the most important rule for achieving scalability within an application. What it means:
  
 Find the resource that has a fixed limit that you know you can support. For example, a guarantee to handle a certain number of objects in memory. So if we always use resources proportional to the number of objects it is likely we can prevent resource exhaustion. 
 Devise ways of tying what you need to do to the individual resources. 
  
Some examples:
  
 Keep a list of purchase orders with line items over $20 (or whatever).

<p>Introduction: This is an email interview with   Viktor Klang   , Director of Engineering at    Typesafe   , on the    Scala Futures    model &    Akka,    both topics on which is he is immensely passionate and knowledgeable.  
 
How do you structure your application? That’s the question I explored in the article  Beyond Threads And Callbacks . An option I did not talk about, mostly because of my own ignorance, is a powerful stack you may not be all that familiar with: Scala and Akka.
   To remedy my oversight is our acting tour guide, Typesafe’s Viktor Klang, long time Scala hacker and Java enterprise systems architect. Viktor was very patient in answering my questions and was enthusiastic about sharing his knowledge. He’s a guy who definitely knows what he is talking about.

<p>Introduction: Hidden in every computer is a hardware backplane for moving signals around. Hidden in every application are ways of moving messages around and giving code CPU time to process them. Unhiding those capabilities and making them first class facilities for the programmer to control is the idea behind AppBackplane.
 
This goes directly against the trend of hiding everything from the programmer and doing it all automagically. Which is great, until it doesn't work. Then it sucks. And the approach of giving the programmer all the power also sucks, until it's tuned to work together and performance is incredible even under increasing loads. Then it's great.
 
These are two different curves going in opposite directions. You need to decide for your application which curve you need to be on.

<p>Introduction: Ilya Grigorik has written another wonderful article lavishly detailing the extraordinary tactics Chrome employs to hide network latency from users:  Chrome Networking: DNS Prefetch & TCP Preconnect . Ilya springs some surpising factoids on us, revealing how the web has slowed and super sized:
  
 The size of an average page has grown to 1059kB and is now composed of over  80 subresource requests . 
 An average DNS lookup takes between 60 and 120ms. This creates a 100-200ms of latency before a request can be sent because of th full round-trip (RTT) to perform the TCP handshake. 
 Slow mobile experiences are largely due to the much higher RTT's (200-1000ms) on wireless networks. Reducing the number of outbound connections and the total byte size of your pages is the single best optimization you can make for mobile today.  
  
Chrome reduces apparent latency using a host of clever anticipatory mechanisms:

<p>Introduction: There's not a lot  of talk about application architectures at the process level. You have your threads, pools of threads, and you have your callback models. That's about it. Languages/frameworks making a virtue out of simple models, like Go and Erlang, do so at the price of control. It's difficult to make a low latency well conditioned application when a power full tool, like work scheduling, is taken out of the hands of the programmer.
 
But that's not all there is my friend. We'll dive into different ways an application can be composed across threads of control.
 
Your favorite language may not give you access to all the capabilities we are going to talk about, but lately there has been a sort of revival in considering performance important, especially for controlling  latency variance , so I think it's time to talk about these kind of issues. When it was do everything in the thread of a web server thread pool none of these issues really mattered.

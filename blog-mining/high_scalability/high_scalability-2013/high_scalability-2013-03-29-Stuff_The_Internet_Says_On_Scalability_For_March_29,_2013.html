<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's
discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon
organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable
systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the
ACM Queue article have also been included.Amazon grew from a tiny online
bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering
new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden
shared is version of Amazon's birth pangs in a series of blog articlesSite:

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: Like a digital SWAT team that implodes the wrong door on a raid, the FBI
seized multiple racks of computers from DigitalOne, theseracks host websites
from many clients that just happened to be in the same racks as whomever they

andPinboard. With thedensity of serversthese days many 1000s of sites could
easily have been effected.Sites like Pinboard were victims by association,
they did not inhale. This is an association sites have no control over. On a
shared hosting service, you have no control over your fellow VM mates. In a
cloud or a managed service, you have no control over which racks your servers
are in. So like second hand smoke, you get the disease by random association.
There's something inherently unfair about that.Acomment by illumin8 shows just
how Darth insidious this process can be:A popular method used by hackers is to

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.Have we reached the end
of scaling? That's what I asked myself one day after noticing a bunch of "The
End of" headlines. We've reachedThe End of Historybecause the Western liberal
democracy is the "end point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and the
final form of human government." We've reachedThe End of Sciencebecause of the
"fact that there aren't going to be any obvious, cataclysmic revolutions."
We've even reachedThe End of Theorybecause all answers can be found in the
continuous stream of data we're collecting. And doesn't always seem like we're
atThe End of the World?Motivated by the prospect of everything ending, I began
to wonder: have we really reached The End of Scaling?For a while I thought
this might be true. The reason I thought the End of Scaling might be near is
because of the slow down of potential articles at

Amazon'sS3doesn't excite you. And you aren't quite ready to join

something like theGoogle File Systemyou could use to create a unified file

Harris, a.k.aStorageMojo(a great blog BTW), you can now have your own

commodity Linux x86 servers to deliver petabyte-scale file storage. With
features such as automated, transparent file replication and file migration,
Parascale eliminates storage hotspots and delivers massive read/write
bandwidth." Why should you care?I don't know about you, but the "storage

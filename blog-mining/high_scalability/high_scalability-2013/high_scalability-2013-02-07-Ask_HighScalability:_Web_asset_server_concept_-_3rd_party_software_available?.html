<p>Introduction: All,I'm just new to this and have a basic understanding how CDN works? My
questions are:1. How does CDN sync data with web servers for video/images? If
I have a user to upload a video to my site, will it get stored directly in CDN
or it comes to my webserver first and then sync-ed with cache server?2. How to
have only the dynamic video/image delivered through CDN while the rest is
served by a webserver?3. How sync happens and who pays for the bandwidth for
sync?I'd appreciate if someone could explain this.Regards,Janakan Rajendran</p><p>3 0.18644832 <a title="1402-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-18-Shared_filesystem_on_EC2.html">283 high scalability-2008-03-18-Shared filesystem on EC2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi. I'm looking for a way to share files between EC2 nodes. Currently we are
using glusterfs to do this. It has been reliable recently, but in the past it
has crashed under high load and we've had trouble starting it up again. We've
only been able to restart it by removing the files, restarting the cluster,
and filing it up again with our files from backup. This takes ages, and will
take even longer the more files we get.What worries me is that it seems to
make each node a point of failure for the entire system. One node crashes and
soon the entire cluster has crashed. The other problem is adding another node.
It seems like you have to take down the whole thing, reconfigure to include
the new node, and restart. This kind of defeats the horizontal scaling
strategy.We are using 2 EC2 instances as web servers, 1 as a DB master, and 1
as a slave. GlusterFS is installed on the web server machines as well as the
DB slave machine (we backup files to s3 from this machine). The files are

<p>Introduction: Update:Offloading ALL JS Files To Google. Now you can let Google serve all
your javascript files. This article tells you how to do it (upload to Google
Code Project) and why it's a big win (cheap, fast, caching, parallel
downloads, save bandwidth).Don't have a CDN? Why not let Google and Yahoo be
your CDN? At least for Ajax libraries. No charge. Google runs acontent
distribution network and loading architecture for the most popular open source
JavaScript libraries, which include: jQuery, prototype, script.aculo.us,
MooTools, and dojo. The idea is web pages directly include your library of
choice from Google's global, fast, and highly available network. Some have
found much better performance and others experienced slower performance. My
guess is the performance may be slower if your data center is close to you,
but far away users will be much happier. Some negatives: not all libraries are
included, you'll load more than you need because all functionality is
included. Yahoo has had asim</p><p>5 0.1683443 <a title="1402-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-22-Strategy%3A_Run_a_Scalable%2C_Available%2C_and_Cheap_Static_Site_on_S3_or_GitHub.html">1102 high scalability-2011-08-22-Strategy: Run a Scalable, Available, and Cheap Static Site on S3 or GitHub</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the best projects I've ever worked on was creating a large scale web
site publishing system that was almost entirely static. A large team of very
talented creatives made the art work, writers penned the content, and
designers generated templates. All assets were controlled in a database. Then
all that was extracted, after applying many different filters, to a static
site that was uploaded via ftp to dozens of web servers. It worked great.
Reliable, fast, cheap, and simple. Updates were a bit of a pain as it required
pushing a lot of files to a lot of servers, and that took time, but otherwise
a solid system.Alas, this elegant system was replaced with a new fangled
dynamic database based system. Content was pulled from a database using a
dynamic language generated front-end. With a recent series of posts from
Amazon's Werner Vogels, chronicling his experience of transforming his All
Things Distributed blog into a static site using S3's ability to serve web
pages, I get the pleasu</p><p>6 0.16633606 <a title="1402-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-11-Hosting_and_CDN_for_startup_video_sharing_site.html">181 high scalability-2007-12-11-Hosting and CDN for startup video sharing site</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I am looking for a way to distribute files over servers in different physical
locations. My main concern is that I have bandwidth limitations on each
location, and wish to spread the bandwidth load evenly. Atm. I just have 1:1
copies of the files on all servers, and have the application pick a random
server to serve the file as a temp fix...It's a small video streaming service.
I want to spoonfeed the stream to the client with a max bandwidth output, and
support seek. At present I use php to limit the network stream, and read the
file at a given offset sendt as a get parameter from the player for seek. It's
psuedo streaming, but it works.I have been looking at MogileFS, which would
solve the storage part. With MogileFS I can make use of my current php
solution as it supports lighttpd and apache (with mod_rewrite or similar).
However I don't see how I can apply MogileFS to check for bandwidth %
usage?Any reccomendations for how I can solve this?</p><p>4 0.69302034 <a title="1402-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-18-Shared_filesystem_on_EC2.html">283 high scalability-2008-03-18-Shared filesystem on EC2</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This question is for all the gurus here. Please help this novicexI am starting
a video sharing site like YouTube in India. I want to offer the best quality
possible, at minimum cost. Nothing new about it, right? :).I have done some
research on the dedicated hosting services and CDN services available and I
have some basic knowledge on these.Following are my requirements1) My budget
is $500 to $1000 per month for hosting (including CDN if and as applicable).2)
I will need around 500GB of storage and 1TB per month of bandwidth in first
2-3 months and then about 10TB of storage and 5TB per month of bandwidth. And
more ... depending on how big it gets (I can afford more when it gets big)3)
90% of my viewers are in India. Other 10% are in US and UK.Based on the above,
could you please answer my following questions?1) Can I go with just a good
dedicated server to start with and get a CDN service later on when the site
gets big? Or do you think its wise to start with a CDN service?2) Should I</p><p>6 0.68000281 <a title="1402-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_Akamai.html">39 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: Akamai</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Google made a right move by adding web-speed to the search engine ranking.
With this change site latency does't just impact the user experience but it
will determine where you will be placed in google search results.This move
could be a real game changer as it bring site latency and scalability to the
front stage. Sites will not only compete on content but on thier performance.
It is now clear that site performance have much more direct impact on our
business (as appose to indirect impact resulted in user expereince) then ever
before.In this post i try to provide some architecture guide line on how to
control and improve site latency under scale based on a discussion with a
leading eCommerce site the Netherland.See detailed story  here</p><p>2 0.85932779 <a title="1402-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-01-2_tier_switch_selection_for_colocation.html">78 high scalability-2007-09-01-2 tier switch selection for colocation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi, I aminterested in some experienced advice for choosing switches for a
colocated 2-tier architecture. I have the hardware chosen for the webservers,
app servers, and db servers, but need some advice on the network switch in
between:colocation port -> firewall(load balancer) -> 2+ web servers (app
servers) -> gigabit switch -> DB server(possibly cluster for future
expansion)the question is that I am just starting out, i wonder which
rackmount gigabit switch to select for the private LAN between the app server
-> DB servers. Do I need managed for that? Cisco switches are the best, but
they are the most expensive...I am looking at possibly using Dell/Netgear
gigabit switches.Thanks for any input</p><p>3 0.85392404 <a title="1402-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-22-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_22%2C_2011.html">1084 high scalability-2011-07-22-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 22, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We are serving dynamic (PHP) websites and their assets
(JS/CSS/images/videos/binary downloads) via the same apache hosts. The static
files are only being used as origins for CDN services used to distribute those
files. Yet, in the current development-deploy pipeline, these files are
checked into the same version control repositories as the code is. This is
what we would like to change, for several reasons (decouple asset deployment
from development & developers, lessen size of code repositories, etc.)My idea
is to do the following: Set up a media server (cluster) which serves as an API
(REST e.g.). You can PUT files to it, and get back the URL the file is
available through from the public. In between input and output, the media
service deals with everything that's necessary to serve the files: Upload them
to the CDN, create the public URL, write the meta data to a (relational?)
database, assign a version number... This API can be used by a) the
application/website directly to provide C</p><p>6 0.84041572 <a title="1402-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-25-SongPop_Scales_to_1_Million_Active_Users_on_GAE%2C_Showing_PaaS_is_not_Pass%C3%A9.html">1412 high scalability-2013-02-25-SongPop Scales to 1 Million Active Users on GAE, Showing PaaS is not PassÃ©</a></p>

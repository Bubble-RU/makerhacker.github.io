<p>Introduction: Update: Erlang at Facebook by Eugene Letuchy. How Facebook uses Erlang to
implement Chat, AIM Presence, and Chat Jabber support. I've done
someXMPPdevelopment so when I readFacebook was making a Jabber chat clientI
was really curious how they would make it work. While core XMPP is
straightforward, a number of protocol extensions like discovery, forms, chat
states, pubsub, multi user chat, and privacy lists really up the
implementation complexity. Some real engineering challenges were involved to
make this puppy scale and perform. It's not clear what extensions they've
implemented, but a blog entry by Facebook's Eugene Letuchy hits some of the
architectural challenges they faced and how they overcame them.A web based
Jabber client poses a few problems because XMPP, like most IM protocols, is an
asynchronous event driven system that pretty much assumes you have a full time
open connection. After logging in the server sends a client roster information
and presence information.

<p>Introduction: Benjamin Erb (@b_erb) from Ulm University recently published his diploma
thesis on"Concurrent Programming for Scalable Web Architectures". The thesis
provides a comprehensive survey on different concepts and techniques of
concurrency inside web architectures, including web servers, application logic
and storage backends. It incorporates research publications, hands-on reports
and also regards popular programming languages, frameworks and
databases.Abstract:Web architectures are an important asset for various large-
scale web applications, such as social networks or e-commerce sites. Being
able to handle huge numbers of users concurrently is essential, thus
scalability is one of the most important features of these architectures.
Multi-core processors, highly distributed backend architectures and new web
technologies force us to reconsider approaches for concurrent programming in
order to implement web applications and fulfil scalability demands. While

<p>Introduction: High Performance Multithreaded Access to Amazon SimpleDBis a great follow up
to the idea inHow SimpleDB Differs from a RDBMSthat more programming is the
price paid for performance in SimpleDB. It shows how much work and
infrastructure is required to batter better performance out of
SimpleDB.Remember, in SimpleDB you get keys to records from queries so if you
want to get all the fields for records you need to make separate requests.
Since SimpleDB isn't exactly a speed daemon the obvious strategy is to
parallelize. Even if a job takes a 100 msecs you can get a lot done in a
little time if you can execute enough jobs in parallel.Parallelization is the
approach taken by Haakon@AWS in his Java code example of how to get the most
out of SimpleDB. You can find the code atIndexing and Querying Amazon S3
Metadata with Amazon SimpleDB. We'll also consider how a back-end service
architecture built on Erlang may be a better fit with cloud computing.breakTwo

<p>Introduction: Famous computer scientist John Backus, he's the B in BNF(Backus-Naur form) and
the creator of Fortran, gave a Turing Award Lecture titled Can programming be
liberated from the von Neumann style?: a functional style and its algebra of
programs, that has layed out a division in programming that lives long after
it was published in 1977. It's the now familiar argument for why functional
programming is superior:The assignment statement is the von Neumann bottleneck
of programming languages and keeps us thinking in word-at-a-time terms in much
the same way the computer's bottleneck does....The second world of
conventional programming languages is the world of statements. The primary
statement in that world is the assignment statement itself. All the other
statements of the language exist in order to make it possible to perform a
computation that must be based on this primitive construct: the assignment
statement.Here's a response by DijkstraA review of the 1977 Turing Award

<p>Introduction: Famous computer scientist Leslie Lamport is definitely not a worse is
betterkind of guy. In Computation and State Machines he wants to make the case
that to get better programs we need to teach programmers to think better. And
programmers will think better when they learn to think in terms of concepts
firmly grounded in the language of mathematics.I was disappointed that there
was so much English in the paper. Surely it would have been more convincing if
it was written as a mathematical proof. Or would it?This whole topic has been
argued extensively throughout thousands of years of philosophy. Mathematics
has always been a strange attractor for those trying to escape a flawed human
rationality. In the end as alluring as the utopia of mathematics is, it lacks
a coherent theory of meaning and programming is not about rearranging
ungrounded symbols, it's about manipulating and shaping meaning.For
programmers I thinkLudwig Wittgensteinhas the right sense of things. Meaning

<p>Introduction: The Declarative Imperative: Experiences and Conjectures in Distributed Logic
is written by UC Berkeley's Joseph Hellersteinfor a keynote speech he gave at
PODS. The video version of the talk is here. You may have heard about Mr.
Hellerstein through theBerkeley Orders Of Magnitude project (BOOM), whose
purpose is to help people build systems that are OOM (orders of magnitude)
bigger than are building today, with OOM less effort than traditional
programming methodologies. A noble goal which may be why BOOM was rated as a
top 10 emerging technology for 2010 byMIT Technology Review. Quite an
honor.The motivation for the talk is a familiar one: it's a dark period for
computer programming and if we don't learn how to write parallel programs the
children of Moore's law will destroy us all. We have more and more processors,
yet we are stuck on figuring out how the average programmer can exploit them.

<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting
system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by
advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide
guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see
how!Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed
in a format calledAlexandrian form which draws on constructs used by
Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:The pattern
nameThe problem the pattern is trying to solveContextSolutionExamplesDesign
rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why
experts use itPatterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context,
and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new
context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next
‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied. A pattern language is a structured
collection of such patterns that build o</p><p>6 0.67637151 <a title="1446-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-20-Product%3A_SmartFrog_a_Distributed_Configuration_and_Deployment_Framework.html">161 high scalability-2007-11-20-Product: SmartFrog a Distributed Configuration and Deployment Framework</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Travis Reeder inSpikability - An Application's Ability to Handle Unknown
and/or Inconsistent Load gives four good ways of handling spikey loads:Have
more resources than you'll ever need. Estimate the maximum traffic you'll need
and keep that many servers running. Downside is you are paying for capacity
you aren't using.Disable features during high loads. Reduce load by disabling
features or substituting in lighter weight features. Downside is users to have
access to features.Auto scaling. Launch new servers in response to load.
Downsides are it's complicated to setup and slow to respond. Random spikes
will cause cycling of instances going up and down.Use message queues. Queues
soak up work requests during traffic spikes. More servers can be started to
process work from the queue. Resources aren't wasted and features are
disabled. Downside is increased latency.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.93819493 <a title="1446-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-25-Paper%3A_Making_reliable_distributed_systems_in_the_presence_of_software_errors.html">1446 high scalability-2013-04-25-Paper: Making reliable distributed systems in the presence of software errors</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joe Armstrong is a co-inventor ofErlang and general all around renaissance
software tinkerer as shown by his excellent work on writing aC Compiler and
his voluminous work on GitHub.Given the success of Erlang it's probably no
surprise that he wrote his thesis on the ground breaking ideas behind Erlang:
Making reliable distributed systems in the presence of software errors.Even if
you have yet to join the cult of Erlang the principles behind Erlang are
universal and well worth exploring for your own designs. Highly
recommended.Introduction:How can we program systems which behave in a
reasonable manner in the presence of software errors? This is the central
question that I hope to answer in this thesis. Large systems will probably
always be delivered containing a number of errors in the software,
nevertheless such systems are expected to behave in a reasonable manner.To
make a reliable system from faulty components places certain requirements on
the system. The requirements can be satisf</p><p>3 0.89581454 <a title="1446-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-10-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_10th%2C_2014.html">1576 high scalability-2014-01-10-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 10th, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Like a digital SWAT team that implodes the wrong door on a raid, the FBI
seized multiple racks of computers from DigitalOne, theseracks host websites
from many clients that just happened to be in the same racks as whomever they
are investigating. Downed sites include Instapaper, Curbed Network,
andPinboard. With thedensity of serversthese days many 1000s of sites could
easily have been effected.Sites like Pinboard were victims by association,
they did not inhale. This is an association sites have no control over. On a
shared hosting service, you have no control over your fellow VM mates. In a
cloud or a managed service, you have no control over which racks your servers
are in. So like second hand smoke, you get the disease by random association.
There's something inherently unfair about that.Acomment by illumin8 shows just
how Darth insidious this process can be:A popular method used by hackers is to

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.Have we reached the end
of scaling? That's what I asked myself one day after noticing a bunch of "The
End of" headlines. We've reachedThe End of Historybecause the Western liberal
democracy is the "end point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and the
final form of human government." We've reachedThe End of Sciencebecause of the
"fact that there aren't going to be any obvious, cataclysmic revolutions."
We've even reachedThe End of Theorybecause all answers can be found in the
continuous stream of data we're collecting. And doesn't always seem like we're
atThe End of the World?Motivated by the prospect of everything ending, I began
to wonder: have we really reached The End of Scaling?For a while I thought
this might be true. The reason I thought the End of Scaling might be near is
because of the slow down of potential articles at

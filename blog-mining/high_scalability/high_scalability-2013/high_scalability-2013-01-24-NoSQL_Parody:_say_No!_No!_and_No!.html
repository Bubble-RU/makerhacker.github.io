<p>Introduction: This is a hilarious presentation by  Josh Berkus , called  Scale Fail , given at O'Reilly MySQL CE 2011. Josh is entertaining, well spoken, and cleverly hides insight inside chaos. And he makes some dang good points along the way.
  Josh has a problem, you see Josh has learned how to make sites that are both scalable and reliable. So he's puzzled why companies "whose downtime interfaces (Twitter) are more well known than their uptime interfaces" get all the attention, respect, and money for being failures. Just doing your job doesn't make you a hero.  You need these self-inflicted wounds in-order to have the war stories to share at conferences. They get the attention. Just doing your job is boring. This is so unfair in that way life can be.

This is so funny I laughed until I cried! Definitely NSFW. OMG it's hilarious, but it's also not a bad overview of the issues. Especially loved:  You read the latest post on HighScalability.com and think you are a f*cking Google and architect and parrot slogans like Web Scale and Sharding but you have no idea what the f*ck you are talking about . There are so many more gems like that.

<p>Introduction: Update:   How-To Minimize Load Time for Fast User Experiences .  Shows how to analyze the bottlenecks preventing websites and blogs from loading quickly and how to resolve them.  80-90% of the end-user response time is spent on the frontend, so it makes sense to concentrate efforts there before heroically rewriting the backend. Take a shower before buying a Porsche, if you know what I mean. Steve Souders, author of  High Performance Websites  and  Yslow , has  ten more best practices to speed up your website :
  Split the initial payload   Load scripts without blocking   Don’t scatter scripts   Split dominant content domains   Make static content cookie-free   Reduce cookie weight   Minify CSS   Optimize images   Use iframes sparingly   To www or not to www  Sadly, according to String Theory, there are only 26.7 rules left, so get them while they're still in our dimension.  Here are  slides  on the first few rules. Love the speeding dog slide. That's exactly what my dog looks like trav</p><p>4 0.61682278 <a title="1393-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-09-Why_My_Slime_Mold_is_Better_than_Your_Hadoop_Cluster.html">1225 high scalability-2012-04-09-Why My Slime Mold is Better than Your Hadoop Cluster</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update :  Organism without a brain creates external memories for navigation  shows slime mold is even cooler than originally thought, storing a record of where it's been using slime: The authors conclude, the slime isn't just the mold's calling card. Instead, it's a way of marking the environment so that the organism can sense where it's been, and not expend effort on searches that won't pay off. Although the situation isn't an exact parallel, the authors make a comparison to the pheromone trails used by ants. 
 
 
 
In   After Life: The Strange Science Of Decay    there’s a truly incredible sequence of gorgeously shot video showing how    creeping slime mold    solves mazes and performs other other amazing feats of computation. Take a look at what simple one celled organisms can do:        The whole video is really well done and shockingly revelatory. It’s the story of decay, how atoms created during the Big Bang and through countless supernova explosions are continually rearranged an</p><p>5 0.53511775 <a title="1393-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-30-Google_Finds_NUMA_Up_to_20%25_Slower_for_Gmail_and_Websearch.html">1467 high scalability-2013-05-30-Google Finds NUMA Up to 20% Slower for Gmail and Websearch</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When you have a large population of servers you have both the opportunity and the incentive to perform interesting studies. Authors from Google and the University of California in  Optimizing Google’s Warehouse Scale Computers: The NUMA Experience  conducted such a study, taking a look at how jobs run on clusters of machines using a  NUMA  architecture. Since NUMA is common on server class machines it's a topic of general interest for those looking to maximize machine utilization across clusters.
 
Some of the results are surprising:
  
 The methodology of how to attribute such fine performance variations to NUMA effects within such a complex system is perhaps more interesting than the results themselves. Well worth reading just for that story. 
 The performance swing due to NUMA is up to 15% on AMD Barcelona for Gmail backend and 20% on Intel Westmere for Web-search frontend.  
 Memory locality is not always King. Because of the interaction between NUMA and cache sharing/contention it</p><p>6 0.53091824 <a title="1393-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-15-Large-scale_Graph_Computing_at_Google.html">631 high scalability-2009-06-15-Large-scale Graph Computing at Google</a></p>

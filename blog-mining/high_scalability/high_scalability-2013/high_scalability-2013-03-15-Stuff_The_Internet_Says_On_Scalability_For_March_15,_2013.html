<p>Introduction: This post on  Prismatic ’s Architecture is adapted from an email conversation with Prismatic programmer  Jason Wolfe  .  What should you read on the web today? Any thoroughly modern person must solve this dilemma every day, usually using some occult process to divine what’s important in their many feeds: Twitter, RSS, Facebook, Pinterest, G+, email, Techmeme, and an uncountable numbers of other information sources.  Jason Wolfe from Prismatic has generously agreed to describe their thoroughly modern solution for answering the “what to read question” using lots of sexy words like Machine Learning, Social Graphs, BigData, functional programming, and in-memory real-time feed processing. The result is possibly even more occult, but this or something very much like it will be how we meet the challenge of finding interesting topics and stories hidden inside infinitely deep pools of information.  A couple of things stand out about Prismatic. They want you to know that Prismatic is being built</p><p>5 0.141807 <a title="1424-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles_with_Sharding_-_What_can_we_learn_from_the_Foursquare_Incident%3F.html">920 high scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles with Sharding - What can we learn from the Foursquare Incident?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great scalability solution, but caching also  comes with problems .  Sharding  is a great scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in a  post-mortem  about their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database Foursquare uses, also contributed their  post-mortem  of what went wrong too.
 
Now that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?
 
First, like for  Facebook , huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in a pretty cool industry.
 
Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built by a small group of people, under immense pressure</p><p>6 0.1410092 <a title="1424-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Are_Cloud_Based_Memory_Architectures_the_Next_Big_Thing%3F.html">538 high scalability-2009-03-16-Are Cloud Based Memory Architectures the Next Big Thing?</a></p>

 The argument eternal:  Why Some Startups Say the Cloud Is a Waste of Money . The argument follows a getting back-to-nature pattern. Amazon is the glittering city of compromised values and colos are the familiar places of refuge and virtue. But be honest, don't we all really know the score by now?

<p>Introduction: Plop, Plop, Fizz, Fizz, Oh, What a HighScalability it is:
  
  $1.5 billion : The cost of cutting London-Toyko latency by 60ms;  9 days : It took AOL 9 years to hit 1 million users. Facebook 9 months. Draw Something 9 days;   ~362 sq ft solar array : powers 1 sq ft of data center. 
 Is Amazon is trying to margenalize OpenStack by  partnering with Eucalyptus ? 
 As the DevOps turns. You won't see this on TMZ.  Adrian Cockcroft :  There is no central control, the teams do it for themselves in the cloud;  John Allspaw : s/NoOps/OpsDoneMaturelyButStillOps/g;  Edward Capriolo : Trust developers not. Good thing is we all agree DevOps is necessary, the differences are in the how and whom. 
 In a word (or two), Wordnik has  gone cloud . Gone is their big iron, in are envious EC2 instances. Driving the move was HA in multi-datacenters, elasticity for traffic bursts, and incremental cluster upgrades. There has been almost no reduction in performance.

  West-Eberhard : The gene does not lead, it follows. 
  @waldojaquith : To an ant, gravity is nothing, but surface tension is a powerful force. When you change scale, you play by different rules.

   James Mickens : When you debug a distributed system or an OS kernel, you do it Texas-style.

<p>Introduction: Over the last several decades computer architects have been phenomenally successful turning the transistor bounty provided by Moore's Law into chips with ever increasing single-threaded performance. During many of these successful years, however, many researchers paid scant attention to multiprocessor work. Now as vendors turn to multicore chips, researchers are reacting with more papers on multi-threaded systems. While this is good, we are concerned that further work on single-thread performance will be squashed.     To help understand future high-level trade-offs, we develop a corollary to Amdahl's Law for multicore chips [Hill & Marty, IEEE Computer 2008]. It models fixed chip resources for alternative designs that use symmetric cores, asymmetric cores, or dynamic techniques that allow cores to work together on sequential execution. Our results encourage multicore designers to view performance of the entire chip rather than focus on core efficiencies. Moreover, we observe that obtai</p><p>2 0.9660573 <a title="1424-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-06-GigaOm_Structure_08_Conference_on_June_25th_in_San_Francisco.html">341 high scalability-2008-06-06-GigaOm Structure 08 Conference on June 25th in San Francisco</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you just can't get enough high scalability talk you might want to take a look GigaOm's Structure 08 conference. The slate of speakers looks appropriately interesting and San Francisco is truly magical this time of year. High Scalability readers even get a price break is you use the HIGHSCALE discount code! I'll be on vacation so I won't see you there, but it looks like a good time. For a nice change of pace consider visiting   MoMA   next door.  Here's a blurb on the conference:   A reminder to our readers about Structure 08, GigaOm's upcoming conference dedicated to web infrastructure. In addition to keynotes from leaders like Jim Crowe, chairman and CEO of Level 3 Communications and Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon, the event will feature workshops from Google App Engine, Microsoft and a special workshop from Fenwick and West who will cover how to raise money for an infrastructure start up.

<p>Introduction: Hey, this scaling stuff might just be important.  Jim Scheinman,  former Bebo and Friendster exec, puts the blame squarely on Friendster's inability to scale as why they lost the social networking race:   VB  : Can you tell me a bit about what you learned in your time at Friendster? 
 
     JS  :  For me, it basically came down to failed execution on the technology side — we had millions of Friendster members begging us to get the site working faster so they could log in and spend hours social networking with their friends. I remember coming in to the office for months reading thousands of customer service emails telling us that if we didn’t get our site working better soon, they’d be ‘forced to join’ a new social networking site that had just launched called MySpace…the rest is history. To be fair to Friendster’s technology team at the time, they were on the forefront of many new scaling and database issues that web sites simply hadn’t had to deal with prior to Friendster.

<p>Introduction: Neil Conway  from Berkeley CS is giving an advanced level talk at  a meetup today  in San Francisco on a new paper:  Logic and Lattices for Distributed Programming  - extending set logic to support CRDT-style lattices. 
 
The description of the meetup is probably the clearest introduction to the paper:
  Developers are increasingly choosing datastores that sacrifice strong consistency guarantees in exchange for improved performance and availability. Unfortunately, writing reliable distributed programs without the benefit of strong consistency can be very challenging.

 


In this talk, I'll discuss work from our group at UC Berkeley that aims to make it easier to write distributed programs without relying on strong consistency. Bloom is a declarative programming language for distributed computing, while CALM is an analysis technique that identifies programs that are guaranteed to be eventually consistent. I'll then discuss our recent work on extending CALM to support a broader range of</p><p>6 0.93122637 <a title="1424-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-05-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_5%2C_2013.html">1487 high scalability-2013-07-05-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 5, 2013</a></p>

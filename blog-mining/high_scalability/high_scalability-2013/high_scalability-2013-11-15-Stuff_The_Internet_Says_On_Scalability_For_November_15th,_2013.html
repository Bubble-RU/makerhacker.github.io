<p>Introduction: With Amazon     announcing new High I/O 2TB SSD instances    the age of SSD has almost arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on demand rate the   price per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:   27 cents ($27K/100K IOPS) per vs    $1.25 for disk   .     With the obvious benefits of giant SSD machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it’s interesting to consider: what architecture decisions might you make differently in the future? 
   More Headroom for Vertical Scaling Simplifies Everything   
 The beauty of higher hardware performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This has always been the allure of    vertical scaling    and is well realized by SSDs through a combination of high throughput, low latencies, and just as important, high densities.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Frédéric Faure   (architect at  Ysance )  on the differences between using a cloud infrastructure and building your own. Frédéric was kind enough to translate the original French version of this article into English. 
 
I’ve been noticing many questions about the differences inherent in choosing between a Cloud infrastructure such as  AWS  (Amazon Web Services) and a traditional physical infrastructure. Firstly, there are a certain number of preconceived notions on this subject that I will attempt to decode for you. Then, it must be understood that each infrastructure has its advantages and disadvantages: a Cloud-type infrastructure does not necessarily fulfill your requirements in every case, however, it can satisfy some of them by optimizing or facilitating the features offered by a traditional physical infrastructure. I will therefore demonstrate the differences between the two that I have noticed, in order to help you make up your own mind.

<p>Introduction: I am working on the design for my database and can't seem to come up with a firm schema.  I am torn between normalizing the data and dealing with the overhead of joins and denormalizing it for easy sharding.  The data is essentially music information per user: UserID, Artist, Album, Song.  This lends itself nicely to be normalized and have separate User, Artist, Album and Song databases with a table full of INTs to tie them together.  This will be in a mostly read based environment and with about 80% being searches of data by artist album or song.  By the time I begin the query for artist, album or song I will already have a list of UserID's to limit the search by.  The problem is that the tables can get unmanageably large pretty quickly and my plan was to shard off users once it got too big. Given this simple data relationship what are the pros and cons of normalizing the data vs denormalizing it?  Should I go with 4 separate, normalized tables or one 4 column table?  Perhaps it might</p><p>2 0.8848083 <a title="1549-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-30-Basho_Lives_up_to_their_Name_With_Consistent_Smashing.html">868 high scalability-2010-07-30-Basho Lives up to their Name With Consistent Smashing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For some Friday Fun nerd style, I thought this  demonstration from Basho  on the difference between single master, sharding, and consistent smashing was really clever. I love the use of safety glasses! And it's harder to crash a server with a hammer than you might think...

 Quotable Quotes:                           
 
  fidotron : It feels like we've gone in one big circle, where first we move the DB on to a separate machine for performance, yet now more computation will go back to being done nearer the data (like Hadoop) and we'll try to pretend it's all just one giant computer again. 
  @pbailis : Building systems from the ground up with distribution, scale, and availability in mind is much easier than retrofitting single-node systems. 
  @merv : #awsreinvent Jassy: Netflix has 10,000s of EC2 instances. They are the final deployment scenario: All In. And others are coming.

<p>Introduction: This question was asked over email and I thought a larger audience might want to take a whack at it. 
 
I have a problem I’d like to have your view on. I’ve looked around a lot, and I haven’t found a definite answer. The question is this:
  Is it true that for a scalable web-based system targeting millions of users (hopefully), using Microsoft technology(.Net/SQL Server) over open source technologies like python/ruby/php and mysql (mariadb) / postgresql will cost you more? Is there any justification for paying up for Microsoft licenses(OS, SQL Server, …)?
 
I am in charge of selecting the technology toolbox for a startup which is going to build a scalable public web platform. I’ve worked as a developer and database developer/admin (mainly as a DBA) using different platforms and technologies, but my main focus is on Microsoft technology. I’ve considered all other important factors for this decision, and at the end, I always come back to the question of money.

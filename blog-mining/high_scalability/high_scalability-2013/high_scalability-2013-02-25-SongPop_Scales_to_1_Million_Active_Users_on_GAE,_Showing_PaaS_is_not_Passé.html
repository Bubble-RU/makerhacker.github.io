</p><p>4 This one sounds a bit like a sales pitch, but once they reached 100K daily active users they opened up a Premier Support account, which allowed them to talk to a real life person and solve downtime problems quickly. [sent-11, score-0.51]
</p><p>5 To reduce ready latency they collected data spread across several models into one entity. [sent-13, score-0.058]
</p><p>6 To reduce queries a user's opponent list was cached into memcache, which is a feature of GAE. [sent-16, score-0.201]
</p><p>7 This and the denormalization change took one engineer 4 days. [sent-17, score-0.125]
</p><p>8 Once performance of an operation passes a threshold it's time to fallback to a different more predictable strategy. [sent-19, score-0.198]
</p><p>9 Queries were slow and the cause was traced to many indexed properties being used. [sent-21, score-0.21]
</p><p>10 The solution was to use a composite index or combine the data into a single entity. [sent-22, score-0.068]
</p><p>11 This problem was traced with the help with Premier Support, which also shows a weakness of PaaS, shouldn't programmers be able to find these kind of issues? [sent-23, score-0.214]
</p><p>12 One advantage companies like Amazon and Google have is that they can create a powerful suite of cooperating services. [sent-26, score-0.07]
</p><p>13 Since SongPop needs to consume and distribute 17 terabytes/day of songs and images worldwide, they've found Google Cloud Storage affordable and very easy to use from GAE. [sent-27, score-0.292]
</p><p>14 GAE requests automatically include headers which contain location information based on the IP address of the client request. [sent-31, score-0.13]
</p><p>15 Scalable, consistent, low latency game play is hard, so why do it all? [sent-35, score-0.103]

</p><p>17 You appear to be playing against a real person, but there are none of the pesky engineering challenges. [sent-37, score-0.08]
</p><p>18 You only have to store sound snippets and game results, match players to games, and then reply the games. [sent-38, score-0.241]
</p><p>19 Clearly this is your canonical Facebook style game, so it's not a complicated application, but it is a good existence proof to include in your architecture decision matrix. [sent-40, score-0.19]

<p>Introduction: Ten million players a day and over fifty million players a month interact
socially with friends usingPlayfishgames on social platforms like The
Facebook, MySpace, and the iPhone. Playfish was an early innovator in the
fastest growing segment of the game industry:social gaming, which is the love
child between casual gaming and social networking. Playfish was also an early
adopter of the Amazon cloud, running their system entirely on 100s of cloud
servers. Playfish finds itself at the nexus of some hot trends (which may by
why EA bought them for$300 millionand they think a$1 billion gameis possible):
building games on social networks, build applications in the cloud, mobile
gaming, leveraging data driven design to continuously evolve and improve
systems, agile development and deployment, andselling virtual goodas a

<p>Introduction: "Everything in war is simple, but theďťż simplest thing is difficult." -- Carl
von ClausewitzGames are proving grounds for software architecture. They
combine scale, high performance, challenging problems, a rabid user base, cost
sensitivity, and the need for profit. And when games have in-game currency,
like EVE Online has, there's money at play, so you can't just get away with a
c'est la vie attitude. Engineering must be applied. InPlanning for war: how
the EVE Online servers deal with a 3,000 person battle, we learn some
techniques EVE Online uses to handle large games:7 Sensible...Do nothing.Most
games are manageable or have spikes that quickly dissipate. Run it Hot.
There's nothing to throttle as servers run at 100%. Why waste money? Use all
your CPU.Shard it. Games are sharded by solar system and multiple solar
systems run on a node.Move it. Games are moved when a machine becomes
overloaded. Live Node Remap, where a live game is moved to a new node without
disconnecting users, is n</p><p>4 0.10737528 <a title="1412-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-17-World_of_Warcraft%27s_Lead_designer_Rob_Pardo_on_the_Role_of_the_Cloud_in_Games.html">1342 high scalability-2012-10-17-World of Warcraft's Lead designer Rob Pardo on the Role of the Cloud in Games</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a really far ranging and insightful interview by Steve Peterson: Game
Industry Legends: Rob Pardo, where the future of gaming is discussed, there
was a section on how the cloud might be used in games. I know there are a lot
of game developers in my audience, so I thought it might be useful:Q. If the
game is free-to-play but I have to download 10 gigabytes to try it out, that
can keep me from trying it. That's part of what cloud gaming is trying to
overcome; do you think cloud gaming is going to make some inroads because of
those technical issues? Rob Pardo: I certainly think there's a lot of
potential in cloud gaming, it's just picking the right games. There's a lot of
hurdles for cloud gaming to overcome, one of which is having to have all these
servers to be able to host all these games, since it's not like you need any
less computing power to play these games. First of all you need someone with
the infrastructure that can have all those games up there. Another issue the

CorinthiansWith this new pricing, developments will be driven by the costs.I

just to make them cheaper is a waste of time.-- Sylvain onGoogle GroupsThe

<p>Introduction: How do you scale a viral Facebook app that has skyrocketed to a mind boggling
65 million installs (the population of France)? That's the fortunate
problemBuddyPokeco-founder Dave Westwood has and he talked about his solution
at Wednesday'sFacebook Meetup. Slides for the complete talk arehere. For those
not quite sure what BuddyPoke is, it's a social network application that lets
users show their mood, hug, kiss, and poke their friends through on-line
avatars.In many ways BuddyPoke is the quintessentially modern web application.
It thrives off the energy of social network driven ecosystems. Game play

<p>Introduction: Several readers had follow-up questions in response to this article. Luke's
responses can be found inHow FarmVille Scales - The Follow-up.If real farming
was as comforting as it is inZynga's mega-hit Farmvillethen my family would
have probably never left those harsh North Dakota winters. None of the scary
bedtime stories my Grandma used to tell about farming are true in
FarmVille.Farmersmake money, plants grow, and animals never visit thered barn.
I guess it's just that keep-your-shoes-clean back-to-the-land charm that has
helped make FarmVille the "largest game in the world" in such an astonishingly
short time.How did FarmVille scale a web application to handle 75 million
players a month? Fortunately FarmVille's Luke Rajlich has agreed to let us in
on a few their challenges and secrets. Here's what Luke has to say...The
format of the interview was that I sent Luke a few general questions and he
replied with this response:FarmVille has a unique set of scaling challenges

<p>Introduction: With theGoogle IO Developer Conferencecompleted there aredozens and dozensof
information packed videos now available. While you won't get any of the nifty
free swag the attendees rake in, it's great of Google to make these videos
available so quickly after the conference. Let's say you don't want to watch
all the videos on the pretense you have a life, here are just a dozen
scalability and architecture related videos you might find interesting:App
Engine Backends by Justin Haugh, Greg Darke. One of this biggest complaints
about GAE are the request deadlines. Those are now gone when you rent a new
Backend node.Scaling App Engine Applicationsby Justin Haugh, Guido van Rossum.
Two parts: how App Engine scales internally and how you as a programmer make
it scale using the tools. Good discussion of scaling and why it's hard; 10,000
queries per second is a large app that needs good architecting; a good
discussion of GAE's predictive scaling formula of how it decides when to spawn
instances;</p><p>6 0.7075395 <a title="1412-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-17-World_of_Warcraft%27s_Lead_designer_Rob_Pardo_on_the_Role_of_the_Cloud_in_Games.html">1342 high scalability-2012-10-17-World of Warcraft's Lead designer Rob Pardo on the Role of the Cloud in Games</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I am looking for a way to distribute files over servers in different physical
locations. My main concern is that I have bandwidth limitations on each
location, and wish to spread the bandwidth load evenly. Atm. I just have 1:1
copies of the files on all servers, and have the application pick a random
server to serve the file as a temp fix...It's a small video streaming service.
I want to spoonfeed the stream to the client with a max bandwidth output, and
support seek. At present I use php to limit the network stream, and read the
file at a given offset sendt as a get parameter from the player for seek. It's
psuedo streaming, but it works.I have been looking at MogileFS, which would
solve the storage part. With MogileFS I can make use of my current php
solution as it supports lighttpd and apache (with mod_rewrite or similar).
However I don't see how I can apply MogileFS to check for bandwidth %
usage?Any reccomendations for how I can solve this?</p><p>2 0.98079646 <a title="1412-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-15-Sun_Customer_Ready_HPC_Cluster%3A_Reference_Configurations_with_Sun_Fire_X2200_M2_and_X2100_M2_Servers.html">418 high scalability-2008-10-15-Sun Customer Ready HPC Cluster: Reference Configurations with Sun Fire X2200 M2 and X2100 M2 Servers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points
for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2
and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products
can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes
configurations in detail using Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers with a
Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200
M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on
single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the
switches.These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's
expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain
constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to
the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are
only available through Sun's factory integration. Although the information

<p>Introduction: Hi,In java web servers, each http request is handled by a thread in thread
pool. So for a Servlet handling the request, a thread is assigned. It is
tempting (and very convinient) to keep context information in the threadlocal
variable. I recently had a requirement where we need to assign logged in user
id and timestamp to request sent to web services. Because we already had the
code in place, it was extremely difficult to change the method signatures to
pass user id everywhere. The solution I thought isclass ReferenceIdGenerator
{public static setReferenceId(String login) {threadLocal.set(login +
System.currentMillis());}public static String getReferenceId() {return
threadLocal.get();}private static ThreadLocal threadLocal =new
ThreadLocal();}class MySevlet {void service(.....) {HttpSession session =
request.getSession(false);String userId =
session.get("userId");ReferenceIdGenerator.setRefernceId(userId);try
{doSomething();}finally {ReferenceIdGenerator.remove();}}This method is also</p><p>4 0.96313345 <a title="1412-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-25-Peter_Norvig%27s_9_Master_Steps_to_Improving_a_Program.html">1601 high scalability-2014-02-25-Peter Norvig's 9 Master Steps to Improving a Program</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Inspired by axkcd comic,Peter Norvig,Director of Research at Google and all
around interesting and nice guy, has created an above par code kata involving
a regex program that demonstrates the core inner loop of many successful
systems profiled on HighScalability.The original code is atxkcd 1313: Regex
Golf, which comes up with an algorithm to find a short regex that matches the
winners and not the losers from two arbitrary lists. The Python code is
readable, the process is TDDish, and the problem, which sounds simple, but
soon explodes into regex weirdness, as does most regex code. If you find
regular expressions confusing you'll definitely benefit from Peter's
deliberate strategy for finding a regex.The post demonstrating the iterated
improvement of the program is atxkcd 1313: Regex Golf (Part 2: Infinite
Problems). As with most first solutions it wasn't optimal. To improve the
program Peter recommends the following steps: Profiling: Figure out where the
program spends its time.

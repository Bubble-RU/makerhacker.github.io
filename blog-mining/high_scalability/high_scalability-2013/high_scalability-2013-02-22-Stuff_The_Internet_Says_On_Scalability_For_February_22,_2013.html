<p>Introduction: Update 4: Heroku versus GAE & GAE/JUpdate 3:Heroku has gone live!.
Congratulations to the team. It's difficult right now to get a feeling for the
relative cost and reliability of Heroku, but it's an impressive accomplishment
and a viable option for people looking for a delivery platform.Update 2:Heroku
Architecture. A great interactive presentation of the Heroku stack. Requests
flow into Nginx used as a HTTP Reverse Proxy. Nginx routes requests into a
Varnish based HTTP cache. Then requests are injected into an Erlang based
routing mesh that balances requests across a grid of dynos. Dynos are your
application "VMs" that implement application specific behaviors. Dynos
themselves are a stack of: POSIX, Ruby VM, App Server, Rack, Middleware,
Framework, Your App. Applications can access PostgreSQL. Memcached is used as
an application caching layer.Update: Aaron WorshamInterview with James
Lindenbaum, CEO of Heroku. Aaron nicely sums up their goal: Heroku is looking

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: If you've wondered why I haven't been posting lately it's because I've been on
an amazingBeach's motorcycle tourof theAlps(and,and,and,and,and,and,and,and).
My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.The trip was
more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after
mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent
Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling
local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the
winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system,
listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank
water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local
German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of
fellow riders. Magical.They say you'll ride more twists and turns on this trip
than a</p><p>2 0.98991567 <a title="1411-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-28-NoSQL_Took_Away_the_Relational_Model_and_Gave_Nothing_Back.html">930 high scalability-2010-10-28-NoSQL Took Away the Relational Model and Gave Nothing Back</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: Benjamin Black said he was the source of the quote and also said I was
wrong about what he meant. His real point:The meaning of the statement was
that NoSQL systems (really the various map-reduce systems) are lacking a
standard model for describing and querying and that developing one should be a
high priority task for them.At the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto, an audience
member, sorry, I couldn't tell who, said something I found really
interesting:NoSQL took away the relational model and gave nothing back.The
idea being that NoSQL has focussed on ease of use, scalability, performance,
etc, but it has lost the idea of how data relates to other data. True to its
name, the relational model is very good at capturing a managing relationships.
With NoSQL all relationships have been pushed back onto the poor programmer to
implement in code rather than the database managing it. We've sacrificed
usability. NoSQL is about concurrency, latency, and scalability, but it's not
about data.My</p><p>3 0.98685777 <a title="1411-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-10-Saying_Yes_to_NoSQL%3B_Going_Steady_with_Cassandra_at_Digg.html">793 high scalability-2010-03-10-Saying Yes to NoSQL; Going Steady with Cassandra at Digg</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The last six months have been exciting for Digg's engineering team. We're
working on a soup-to-nuts rewrite. Not only are we rewriting all our
application code, but we're also rolling out a new client and server
architecture. And if that doesn't sound like a big enough challenge, we're
replacing most of our infrastructure components and moving away from
LAMP.Perhaps our most significant infrastructure change is abandoning MySQL in
favor of a NoSQL alternative. To someone like me who's been building systems
almost exclusively on relational databases for almost 20 years, this feels
like a bold move.What's Wrong with MySQL?Our primary motivation for moving
away from MySQL is the increasing difficulty of building a high performance,
write intensive, application on a data set that is growing quickly, with no
end in sight. This growth has forced us into horizontal and vertical
partitioning strategies that have eliminated most of the value of a relational
database, while still incurring all t</p><p>4 0.97967589 <a title="1411-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-16-Just-In-Time_Scalability%3A_Agile_Methods_to_Support_Massive_Growth_%28IMVU_case_study%29.html">493 high scalability-2009-01-16-Just-In-Time Scalability: Agile Methods to Support Massive Growth (IMVU case study)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: BeforeWe started with a small site, a mess of open source, and a small team
that didn't know much about scaling.AfterWe ended with a large site, a medium
sized team, and an architecture that has scaled.We never stopped. We used a
roadmap and a compass, made weekly changes in direction, regularly shipped
code on Wednesday to handle the next weekend's capacity constraints, and
shipped new features the whole time.These are excerpts from the IMVU PDF
presentation of their architecture which can be viewed or
downloadedhere.IMVUis an online destination where adults and teens meet new
people in 3D. IMVU won the 2008 Virtual Worlds Innovation Award and was also
named a Rising Star in the 2008 Silicon Valley Technology Fast 50 program.</p><p>5 0.97965813 <a title="1411-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-05-Easier_Production_Releases_.html">173 high scalability-2007-12-05-Easier Production Releases </a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve been a part of some late night release procedures and they’re never fun.
You’ve got QA, Dev, IT and a handful of managers sitting in their jammies in a
group IM (or worse, a conference call) from 2:00 AM until way too early in the
morning. Everyone’s grumpy and sleepy, causing the release to be more
difficult and take longer. Sometimes the dreaded “rollback!” is yelled. All
this because you’re running a high profile website that needs to be accessible
24/7, and 2:00 AM - 5:00 AM downtime is better than daytime downtime.If you're
a site that doesn't have 10s of thousands to drop on a real http load
balancer, use this strategy to release software during business hours with no
downtime using apache's mod_proxy_balancer....</p><p>6 0.97877717 <a title="1411-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-24-INFOSCALE_2009_in_June_in_Hong_Kong.html">580 high scalability-2009-04-24-INFOSCALE 2009 in June in Hong Kong</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As a little trip down memory lane this was the first post on High Scalability,
an unbelievable five years ago. The purpose of the site as laid out here has
not really changed at all. The goal is to help people do their jobs better and
I think more times than not that's what has happened...We started High
Scalability to help you build successful scalable websites. This site tries to
bring together all the lore, art, science, practice, and experience of
building scalable websites into one place so you can learn how to build your
system with confidence. Hopefully this site will move you further and faster
along the learning curve of success.

ServerHow algorithms help determine that shape of our world. First we encode
normative rules of an idealized world in algorithms. Second those algorithms
help enforce those expectations by nudging humans in to acting accordingly. A
fun example is the story of Ed Bolian's Record-Breaking Drive. Ed raced from
New York to L.A. at speeds of up to 158 mph, "breaking countless laws - and
the previous record, by more than two hours." His approach is one that any
nerd would love. He had three radar detectors, two laser jammers, two nav
systems, a CB radio, a scanner, two iPhones and two iPads running applications
like Waze, lookouts in the back seat scanning for cops, and someone scouting
ahead. Awesome! For the moral of the story, they were going so fast Ed said

<p>Introduction: Jesse Robbins at O'Reily Radar has a nicepost on how spendinga little up front
time on figuring out how to scale your operations process saves money on ops
people and allows you to save time adding and upgrading servers. Adding,
monitoring, and upgrading servers can get so incredibly screwed up that a herd
of squirrels has to work overtime just to put out a release. Or it can be one
button simple from your automated build system out to your servers. This is
one area where "do the simplest thing that could possibly work" is a dumb idea
and Jesse does a good job capturing the advantages of doing it right.</p><p>3 0.72079116 <a title="1556-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-07-Five_Ways_to_Stop_Framework_Fixation_from_Crashing_Your_Scaling_Strategy.html">347 high scalability-2008-07-07-Five Ways to Stop Framework Fixation from Crashing Your Scaling Strategy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you've wondered why I haven't been posting lately it's because I've been on
an amazingBeach's motorcycle tourof theAlps(and,and,and,and,and,and,and,and).
My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.The trip was
more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after
mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent
Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling
local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the
winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system,
listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank
water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local
German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of
fellow riders. Magical.They say you'll ride more twists and turns on this trip

<p>Introduction: Gordon Ramsayis a world renowned chef with a surprising amount to say on
software development. Well, he says it about cooking and running a restaurant,
but it applies to software development too.You may have seen Gordon Ramsay on
one of his many TV shows. Hell's Kitchen is a competition between chefs trying
to win a dream job: head chef of their own high-end restaurant. On this show
Ramsay is judge, jury, and executioner. And he chops off more than a few
heads. Kitchen Nightmares is a show where Ramsay is called in by restaurant
owners to help turn around their failing restaurants. On this show Ramsay is
there to help.If you just watch Hell's Kitchen you will likely conclude Ramsay
is one of the devil's own helpers ("ram" is the symbol of the devil and "say"
means he speaks for the devil: Ramsay). Ramsay screams, yells, cusses,
belittles, and throws tantrums even a 7 year old could learn from. Then he
does it all over gain just for spite. In Hell's Kitchen there's no evidence at
all of</p><p>5 0.69651979 <a title="1556-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-23-Scaling_your_cookie_recipes.html">390 high scalability-2008-09-23-Scaling your cookie recipes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This article on scaling cookie baking recipes showed up in one my key word
alerts. Lots of weird things show up in alerts, but I really like cookies and
the parallels were just so delicious. Scaling in the cookie baking world
is:the process of multiplying your recipe by many times to produce much more
dough for many more cookies. It’s the difference between making enough dough
in one batch to make two dozen cookies, or 2000 cookies.Hey, pretty close to
the website notion. Yet as any good cook knows any scaled up recipe must be
tweaked a little as things change at scale. Let's see what else we're supposed
to do (quoted from the article):Be Patient- When making large batches of
cookies, the most important thing that you have to remember is not to rush.Use
Fresh Ingredients- This is always an important thing to keep in mind.Don’t use
as much leavening- When you’re making a large batch of cookie dough, remember
to scale down the amount of baking powder that you use.Watch the spice- As a

<p>Introduction: Love this little example of the human condition fromJohn Kellden viaIlya
Grigorik. This happens so often to me shopping at Costco or making lane
changes on the highway or picking stocks. Sometimes it's just never the right
line and trying to make it better only makes it worse. Stick and stay. Buy and
hold. Live to queue another day.</p><p>2 0.82181787 <a title="1556-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-04-IPS-IDS_for_heavy_content_site.html">238 high scalability-2008-02-04-IPS-IDS for heavy content site</a></p>
<p>Introduction: All,My site would have heavy content (video/pictures). I'm looking for an
efficient IPS/IDS solution which would not introduce much of latency. I'm more
familiar with Cisco ASA and also familiar with Juniper, Foundry and others. I
also came across snort but haven't used it before. I'm more of looking for an
appliance (for the ease of configuration,support etc...)Could any one share
their thoughts on performane of IPS/IDS from this vendors?Thanks!Janakan

<p>Introduction: It looks like in the near future I'll have a chance to interview the Elastra
CEO. Elastra provides standarddatabases--MySQL, EnterpriseDB and PostgreSQL--
on top of EC2 and S3. They are selling aggressive pricing, expandable and
contactable database resource usage in response to demand, and a simple
management and operations interface to well known databases deployed in a
cloud. Elastra could be an important option for developers looking for a more
traditional cloudy database.I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions
for questions you would like answered? What would you like to know about their
service? What are you looking for in a cloudy database? What would stop you
from adopting it or what would make you decide to adopt it? Any ideas you have
would help a lot and will probably be better than anything I have.</p><p>4 0.77483916 <a title="1556-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-23-Weblink_Template.html">22 high scalability-2007-07-23-Weblink Template</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ricky HoinScalable System Design Patternshas created a great list of
scalability patterns along with very well done explanatory graphics. A summary
of the patterns are:Load Balancer- a dispatcher determines which worker
instance will handle a request based on different policies.Scatter and Gather-
a dispatcher multicasts requests to all workers in a pool. Each worker will
compute a local result and send it back to the dispatcher, who will
consolidate them into a single response and then send back to the
client.Result Cache- a dispatcher will first lookup if the request has been
made before and try to find the previous result to return, in order to save
the actual execution.Shared Space- all workers monitors information from the
shared space and contributes partial knowledge back to the blackboard. The
information is continuously enriched until a solution is reached.Pipe and
Filter- all workers connected by pipes across which data flows.MapReduce-
targets batch jobs where disk I/O is th</p><p>6 0.74007022 <a title="1556-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-20-Ask_HighScalability%3A_How_do_I_organize_millions_of_images%3F.html">1268 high scalability-2012-06-20-Ask HighScalability: How do I organize millions of images?</a></p>

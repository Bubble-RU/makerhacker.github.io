  @marshallk  : Google runs 100-200 experiments every day on UI, algorithm & product 
  @styggiti  : The problem with companies like IBM and Oracle baking NoSQL "scalability" into their products isn't the tech, it's the $$ licensing. 
 
 
  Blazing fast node.js: 10 performance tips from LinkedIn Mobile . You may have thought that node.js made just everything magically fast, but Shravya Garlapati has some great strategies for going even faster: Avoid synchronous code; Turn off socket pooling;  Don't use Node.js for static assets; Render on the client-side; Use gzip; Go parallel; Go session-free; Use binary modules; Use standard V8 JavaScript instead of client-side libraries; Keep your code small and light.

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear? For years startups, like the frenetically inventive</p><p>4 0.11395357 <a title="1414-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-15-ZooKeeper_-_A_Reliable%2C_Scalable_Distributed_Coordination_System_.html">350 high scalability-2008-07-15-ZooKeeper - A Reliable, Scalable Distributed Coordination System </a></p>
<p>Introduction: ZooKeeper  is a  high available and reliable coordination system. Distributed applications use ZooKeeper to store and mediate updates key configuration information. ZooKeeper can be used for leader election, group membership, and configuration maintenance.  In addition  ZooKeeper can be used  for event notification, locking, and as a priority queue mechanism. It's a sort of  central nervous system for distributed systems where the role of the brain is played by the coordination service, axons are the network, processes are the monitored and controlled body parts, and events are the hormones and neurotransmitters used for messaging. Every complex distributed application needs a coordination and orchestration system of some sort, so the ZooKeeper folks at Yahoo decide to build a good one and open source it for everyone to use.   The target market for ZooKeeper are multi-host, multi-process C and Java based systems that operate in a data center. ZooKeeper works using distributed processes</p><p>5 0.10778855 <a title="1414-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

  @hackofalltrades : When positive change is only viewed through its scalability, bad things happen. 
  @faizanj : Is it time for #Netflix to move to a hybrid cloud architecture similar to Zynga zCloud? 
  @adrianco : we try not to invest in undifferentiated heavy lifting 
  @qui_oui : "scalability": a word that makes me think of how likely you are to have the ability to grow scales. 
  @Ninad_M : The question is, is #antifragile conceptually opposite of #bigdata 
  @pbailis : Batch your disk/network IO, kernel interrupts, customer package shipments -> delay arrival but increase efficiency 
  @Carnage4Life : One lesson that is hard for people to learn. Knowing that something occurred is different from knowing why it occurred

<p>Introduction: Submitted for your scaling pleasure: 
  
 Google's PageRank involves  500 million variables and 2 billion terms .  SeaMicro Packs 768 Cores Into its Atom Server .  Twitter: 1 Billion Items Delivered A Day Is Nice, Google+. We Do 350 Billion.  
 Potent quotables:      
 
  @merv  - Does elastic scalability matter? Ask Apple about 1 million e-transactions in a day. $30M worth of multi-gig downloads that must work. 
  @lmacvittie  - Cloud has shifted the focus of scalability from applications to architecture. 
  @bartbohn  - Love the phrase "anarchic scalability" by Roy Fielding 
  @iAjayMe  - Programming: I have come to the conclusion, if you want to do something right the first time (scalability,performance) write it in C++ 
  @mreferre  - Interesting discussion between @jamesurquhart and @lmacvittie about PaaS/App scalability (I think). Need google translator though... 
  @krisajenkins  - My deal with #nosql: if I'm giving up transactions, it has to buy me no SPOF.

<p>Introduction: 3PAR Remote Copy  is a uniquely simple and efficient replication technology that allows customers to protect and share any application data affordably. Built upon 3PAR Thin Copy technology, Remote Copy lowers the total cost of storage by addressing the cost and complexity of remote replication.  Common Uses of 3PAR Remote Copy:  Affordable Disaster Recovery: Mirror data cost-effectively across town or across the world.  Centralized Archive: Replicate data from multiple 3PAR InServs located in multiple data centers to a centralized data archive location.  Resilient Pod Architecture: Mutually replicate tier 1 or 2 data to tier 3 capacity between two InServs (application pods).  Remote Data Access: Replicate data to a remote location for sharing of data with remote users.</p><p>2 0.93089336 <a title="1414-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-17-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_July_17%2C_2010.html">860 high scalability-2010-07-17-Hot Scalability Links for July 17, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: And by hot I also mean temperature. Summer has arrived. It's sizzling here in Silicon Valley. Thank you air conditioning!
  
 Scale the web by appointing a Crawler Czar? Tom Foremski has the idea that  Google should open up their index  so sites wouldn't have to endure the constant pounding by ravenous crawler bots. Don MacAskill of SmugMug estimates  50% of our web server CPU resources  are spent serving crawlers. What a waste. How this would all work with real-time feeds, paid  feeds (Twitter, movies, ...), etc. is unknown, but does it make sense for all that money to be spent on extracting the same data over and over again?

<p>Introduction: If you don’t cannibalize yourself, someone else will. --  Steve Jobs   
 
       
 
 
America as the New World has a long history of inspiring  Utopian communities . Early experiments were famously religious. But there have been many others as new waves of thought have inspired people to organize and try something different.
 
In the 1840s Transcendentalists, believing the true path lay in the perfection of the individual, created intentional communities like  Brook Farm . We've also seen  socialist ,  anarchist ,  hippy , and virtually every other kind of Utopia in-between. Psychologist B.F. Skinner wrote an infamous book,  Walden Two , with a more "scientific" take on creating a Utopian community and Ayn Rand in  Atlas Shrugged  had her free market version.
 
I believe in startup organizations we see the modern version of Utopian energy in action. We now call it by names like "culture hacking", but the goal is the same: to create a new form of human community to achieve a profound go</p><p>4 0.91948056 <a title="1414-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-02-Total_Cost_of_Ownership_for_different_web_development_frameworks.html">338 high scalability-2008-06-02-Total Cost of Ownership for different web development frameworks</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In  Algorithm Design for Performance Aware VM Consolidation  we learn some shocking facts (gambling in Casablanca?):
  
  Average server utilization in many data centers is low, estimated between 5% and 15%. This is wasteful because an idle server often consumes more than 50% of peak power.  
 Surely that's just for old style datacenters? Nope. In Google data centers, workloads that are consolidated use only 50% of the processor cores. Every other processor core is left unused simply to ensure that performance does not degrade. 
  
It's a VM wasteland. The goal is to reduce waste by packing VMs onto machines without hurting performance or wasting resources. The idea is to select VMs that interfere the least with each other and places them together on the same server.
 
It's a NP-Complete problem, but this paper describes a practical method that performs provably close to the optimal. Interestingly they can optimize for performance or power efficiency, so you can use different algorithm</p><p>6 0.89168549 <a title="1414-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-05-Paper%3A_Scalability_Design_Patterns.html">402 high scalability-2008-10-05-Paper: Scalability Design Patterns</a></p>

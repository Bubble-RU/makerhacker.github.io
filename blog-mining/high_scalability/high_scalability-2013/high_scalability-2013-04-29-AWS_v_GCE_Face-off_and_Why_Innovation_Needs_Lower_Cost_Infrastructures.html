<p>Introduction: Are all instances created equal? Perhaps because under multi-tenancy multiple
virtual machines run on the same physical host, not all applications will run
equally well on every instance. In that case it makes sense to measure and
move to a better performing instance. That's the interesting idea
from@botchagalupe:Imagine something like a "performance monkey" where an

<p>Introduction: When EC2 first started the mental model was of a magic Pez dispenser supplying
an infinite stream of instances in any desired flavor. If you needed an
instance, because of a either a failure or traffic spike, it would be there.
As amazing as EC2 is, this model turned out to be optimistic.  From athread on
the Amazon discussion forum we learn any dispenser has limits:As Availability
Zones grow over time, our ability to continue to expand them can become
constrained. In these scenarios, we will prevent customers from launching in
the constrained zone if they do not yet have existing resources in that zone.
We also might remove the constrained zone entirely from the list of options
for new customers. This means that occasionally, different customers will see
a different number of Availability Zones in a particular Region. Both
approaches aim to help customers avoid accidentally starting to build up their
infrastructure in an Availability Zone where they might have less ability to
expand.T</p><p>6 0.72397757 <a title="1448-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-14-Google_Says_Cloud_Prices_Will_Follow_Moore%E2%80%99s_Law%3A_Are_We_All_Renters_Now%3F.html">1647 high scalability-2014-05-14-Google Says Cloud Prices Will Follow Moore’s Law: Are We All Renters Now?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a repost of part 2 (part 1) of an interviewI did for theBoundary
blog.Boundary:  There's another battle coming down the pike between Amazon
(AWS) and Google (GCE). How should the CTO decide which one's best?Hoff: Given
that GCE is still closed to public access we have very little common
experience on which to judge. The best way to decide is as always, by running
a few experiments. Pick a few representative projects, a representative team,
implement the projects on both infrastructures, crunch some numbers, figure
out the bigger picture and then select the one you wanted in the first place
.Sebastian Stadil, founder of Scalr, recently wrote about his experiences on
both platforms and found some interesting differences: AWS has a much richer
set of services; GCE is on-demand only, so AWS can be cheaper; GCE has faster
disk and faster network IO, especially between datacenters; GCE has faster
boot times and can mount read-only partitions across multiple machines; and
GCE shares i</p><p>2 0.89376509 <a title="1448-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-16-Product%3A_GlusterFS.html">278 high scalability-2008-03-16-Product: GlusterFS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Adapted from their website:GlusterFSis a clustered file-system capable of
scaling to several peta-bytes. It aggregates various storage bricks over
Infiniband RDMA or TCP/IP interconnect into one large parallel network file
system. Storage bricks can be made of any commodity hardware such as x86-64
server with SATA-II RAID and Infiniband HBA).Cluster file systems are still
not mature for enterprise market. They are too complex to deploy and maintain
though they are extremely scalable and cheap. Can be entirely built out of
commodity OS and hardware. GlusterFS hopes to solves this problem.GlusterFS
achieved35 GBps read throughput. The GlusterFS Aggregated I/O Benchmark was
performed on 64 bricks clustered storage system over 10 Gbps Infiniband
interconnect. A cluster of 220 clients pounded the storage system with
multiple dd (disk-dump) instances, each reading / writing a 1 GB file with 1MB
block size. GlusterFS was configured with unify translator and round-robin
scheduler.The advantage</p><p>3 0.87651759 <a title="1448-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-08-Cloud_AWS_Infrastructure_vs._Physical_Infrastructure.html">853 high scalability-2010-07-08-Cloud AWS Infrastructure vs. Physical Infrastructure</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byFrederic Faure(architect atYsance)on the differences
between using a cloud infrastructure and building your own. Frederic was kind
enough to translate the original French version of this article into
English.I've been noticing many questions about the differences inherent in
choosing between a Cloud infrastructure such asAWS(Amazon Web Services) and a
traditional physical infrastructure. Firstly, there are a certain number of
preconceived notions on this subject that I will attempt to decode for you.
Then, it must be understood that each infrastructure has its advantages and
disadvantages: a Cloud-type infrastructure does not necessarily fulfill your
requirements in every case, however, it can satisfy some of them by optimizing
or facilitating the features offered by a traditional physical infrastructure.
I will therefore demonstrate the differences between the two that I have
noticed, in order to help you make up your own mind.The FrameworkCloudThere

<p>Introduction: There has been an update on Pinterest: Pinterest growth driven by Amazon cloud
scalability since our last post: A Short on the Pinterest Stack for Handling
3+ Million Users.With Pinterest we see a story very similar to that
ofInstagram. Huge growth, lots of users, lots of data, with remarkably few
employees, all on the cloud.While it's true that both Pinterest and Instagram
are not making great advances inscience and technology, that is more indicator
of the easy power of today's commodity environments rather than a sign of
Silicon Valley's lack of innovation. The numbers are so huge and the
valuations are so high we naturally want some sort of fundamental
technological revolution to underlie their growth. The revolution is more
subtle. It really is just that easy to attain such growth these days, if you
can execute on the right idea. Get used to it. This is the new normal.Here's
what Pinterest looks like today: 80 million objects stored in S3 with 410

This totally requires a scale-up strategy.Facebook at60,000 serversand
counting.Deepak Singh has collected some impressivemassive datastats on
extreme Hadoop usage: Facebook: 36 PB of uncompressed data, 2250 machines,
23,000 cores, 32 GB of RAM per machine, processing 80-90TB/day; Yahoo: 70 PB
of data in HDFS, 170 PB spread across the globe, 34000 servers, Processing 3
PB per day, 120 TB flow through Hadoop every day;Twitter: 7 TB/day into HDFS;
LinkedIn: 120 Billion relationships; 82 Hadoop jobs daily (IIRC); 16 TB of

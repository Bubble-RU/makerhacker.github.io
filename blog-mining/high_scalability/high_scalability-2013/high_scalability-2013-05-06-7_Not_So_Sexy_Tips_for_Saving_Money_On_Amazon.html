<p>Introduction: Can you really create an infinitely scalable infrastructure for less than $100
using Amazon's storage, grid, and queuing services platform? It appears so, at
least for the right application. Amazon beams a spot light on the future
battle of the roll-your-own versus the connect-the-dots approach to building
next generation websites using core external services. Their argument is
strong. Using Amazon's platform you can quickly build an infrastructure that
would otherwise take an eternity to make, a pile of money to create, and an
unbounded mass of people to implement and maintain. Yet Amazon doesn't provide
SLAs, so you can you really trust them with your crown jewels? Facebook
recently leap frogged Amazon's vision with an even more comprehensive set of
services. The battle for the future is on.Site:

<p>Introduction: Pre-generating static files is an oldy but a goody, and as Thomas Brox RĂ¸st
says, it's probably an underused strategy today. At one time this was the
dominate technique for structuring a web site. Then the age of dynamic web
sites arrived and we spent all our time worrying how to make the database
faster and add more caching to recover the speed we had lost in the transition
from static to dynamic.Static files have the advantage of being very fast to
serve. Read from disk and display. Simple and fast. Especially when caching
proxies are used. The issue is how do you bulk generate the initial files, how
do you serve the files, and how do you keep the changed files up to date? This
is the process Thomas covers in his excellent articleServing static files with
Django and AWS - going fast on a budget", where he explains how he converted
600K thousand previously dynamic pages to static pages for his
siteEventseer.net, a service for tracking academic events.Eventseer.net was

<p>Introduction: Update 2: SummizeComputes Computing Resources for a Startup. Lots of nice
graphs showing Amazon is hard to beat for small machines and become less cost
efficient for well used larger machines. Long term storage costs may eat your
saving away. And out of cloud bandwidth costs are high.Update:

media filesand how Blue Origin was able to handle 3.5 million requests and 758
GBs in bandwidth in a single day for very little $$$. Also a Right Scale
article onNetwork performance within Amazon EC2 and to Amazon S3. 75MB/s
between EC2 instances, 10.2MB/s between EC2 and S3 for download, 6.9MB/s
upload.Now that Amazon's S3 (storage service) isout of betaand EC2 (elastic
compute cloud) has added newinstance types(the class of machine you can rent)
with more CPU and more RAM, I thought it would be interesting to take a look
out how their pricing stacks up.The quick conclusion:the more you scale the
more you save. A six node co</p><p>5 0.10456692 <a title="1452-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-05-HotPads_Shows_the_True_Cost_of_Hosting_on_Amazon.html">619 high scalability-2009-06-05-HotPads Shows the True Cost of Hosting on Amazon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mather Corgan, president of HotPads,gave a great talkon how HotPads uses AWS
to run their real estate search engine. I loved the presentation for a few
reasons:It gives real costs on on their servers, how many servers they have,
what they are used for, and exactly how they use S2, EBS, CloudFront and other
AWS services. This is great information for anybody trying to architect a
system and wondering where to run it.HotPads is a "real" application. It's a
small company and at 4.5 million page-views/month it's large but not super
large. It has custom server side components like indexing engines, image
processing, and background database update engines for syncing new real estate
data. And it also stores a lot of images and has low latency requirements.This
a really good example mix of where many companies are or would like to be with
their applications.Their total costs are about $11K/month, which is about what
they were paying at their previous provider. I found this is a little

that usesHadoop,mrjob, andoddjobto processTBsof data. Before Yelp, he built
infrastructure for startups and Amazon. Check out his upcoming talk
atOSCON2013 on Building a Cloud Culture at Yelp.In Q1 2013, Yelp had102
million unique visitors(source: Google Analytics) including approximately 10
million unique mobile devices using the Yelp app on a monthly average
basis.Yelpershavewritten more than39 million rich, local reviews, making Yelp
the leading local guide on everything from boutiques and mechanics to
restaurants and dentists. With respect to data, one of the most unique things
about Yelp is the variety of data: reviews, user profiles, business
descriptions, menus, check-ins, food photos... the list goes on.  We have many
ways to deal data, but today I'll focus on how we handle offline data
processing and analytics.In late 2009, Yelp investigated using Amazon's

should have known better. But when APIs choose to make callbacks from some
mystery thread pool it's hard to keep things straight. I eventually sobered up
and posted all events to a queue so I could make sure the program would work

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ali Khajeh-Hosseini, Technical Lead at
PlanForCloud.com.  I read a recent blog post about TripAdvisor's experiment
with AWS where they attempted to process 700K HTTP requests per minute on a
replica of their live site. There was also an interesting blog post on
Pinterest's massive growth on AWS. These blogs highlighted exactly the types
of questions we're interested in, mainly:How much would it cost to deploy
System X on Cloud Y? e.g. how much would it cost to host TripAdvisor on the
AWS US-East cloud?Would it be cheaper to use deployment option X or Y? e.g.
would it be cheaper to use reserved instances, different types of instances,
different cloud providers...What happens to costs when the system grows? e.g.
Pinterest has around 410TB of data on S3, what if that keeps growing at a rate
of 25% every month, like it has been in the last 10 months?I created a couple

<p>Introduction: Harish Ganesan CTO of8KMiles has a very helpful blog, Cloud, Big Data and
Mobile, where he shows a nice analytical bent which leads to a lot of
practical advice and cost saving tips:Use SQS Batch Requests to reduce the
number of requests hitting SQS which saves costs. Sending 10 messages in a
single batch request which in the example save $30/month.Use SQS Long Polling
to reduce extra polling requests, cutting down empty receives, which in the
example saves ~$600 in empty receive leakage costs.Choose the right search
technology choice to save costs in AWS by matching your activity pattern to
the technology. For a small application with constant load or a heavily
utilized search tier or seasonal loads Amazon Cloud Search looks like the cost
efficient play. Use Amazon CloudFront Price Class to minimize costs by
selecting the right Price Class for your audience to potentially reduce
delivery costs by excluding Amazon CloudFront's more expensive edge
locations.Optimize ElastiCache Cluster</p><p>2 0.92277586 <a title="1452-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-19-Papers%3A_Readings_in_Distributed_Systems.html">497 high scalability-2009-01-19-Papers: Readings in Distributed Systems</a></p>

distributed systems. He's organized them into the following sections: The
Google Papers, Distributed Filesystems, Non-relational Distributed Databases,
The Lamport Papers, and Implementation Issues. Many old favorites on the list
and some that are likely new to you. My new favorite is "Frangipani: A

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byBrian Bulkowski, CTO and co-founder ofAerospike, a
leading clustered NoSQL database, has worked in the area of high performance
commodity systems since 1989.This blog post will tell you exactly how to build
a multi-terabyte high throughput datacenter server. A fast, reliable multi-
terrabyte data tier can be used for recent behavior (messages, tweets, plays,
actions), or anywhere that today you use Redis or Memcache.You need to

<p>Introduction: Sean Hullwith two helpful posts:5 Things That are Toxic to Scalability:Object
Relational Mappers.Create complex queries that hard to optimize and
tweak.Synchronous, Serial, Coupled or Locking Processes.Locks are like stop
signs, traffic circles keep the traffic flowing. Row level locking is better
than table level locking. Use async replication. Use eventual consistency for
clusters.One Copy of Your Database.A single database server is a choke point.
Create parallel databases and let a driver select between them.Having No
Metrics.Visualize what's happening to your system using one of the many
monitoring packages.Lack of Feature Flags.Be able to turn off features via a
flag so when a spike hits features can be turned off to reduce load.3 Ways to
Boost Cloud Scalability:Use Auto-scaling.Spin-up new instances when a
threshold is passed and back down again when traffic drops.Horizontally Scale

<p>Introduction: For a long epoch there was a strategy of scaling up by making ever bigger
super computers. I had the pleasure of programming on a few large massively
multi-processor machines from SGI and DEC. Beautiful, highly specialized
machines that were very expensive. These met the double-tap extinction event
of Moore's law and a Google inspired era of commodity machine based clusters
and extreme software parallelism. Has the tide turned? Does it now make more
sense to use big machines instead of clusters?InBig-Ass Serversâ&bdquo;˘ and the myths
of clusters in bioinformatics, Jerm makes the case that for bionformatics,
it's more cost effective to buy a Big-Ass Server instead of using a cluster of
machines and a lot of specialized parallel programming techniques. It's a
classic scale-up argument that has been made more attractive by the recent
development of relatively inexpensive large machines.SeaMicrohas developed a
512 core machine. Dell has a new96 core server. Supermicro has48 coremachines.

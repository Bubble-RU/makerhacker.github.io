<p>Introduction: Rodrigo Camposshared some interesting benchmark resultsfor AWS instances in
the South America Region (Sao Paulo) and US East Region (North Virginia). He
summarized the results in this thread on theGuerrilla Capacity
Planninglist:The same instance type shows a different behavior depending on
the region that it is running, this is particularly critical if you depend on
multiple regions for disaster recovery or geographical load balancingGenerally
speaking performance is better and more consistent in the South America region
when compared to Virginia, this is probably due to the fact that SA region was
the latest to be deployed. Maybe the SA datacenter uses new server models or
it is just underutilized, but this is a wild guessWrite performance for the
medium instance type in Virginia abruptly decays, dropping from almost 400
call/s to something around 300 calls/s, this is not very clear in the scatter
plot but if you draw a time-based chart you can clearly see this pattern. This

in mid October. I won't be posting, so we'll all have a break. Disappointing,
I know. If you've ever wanted to write an article for HighScalability, this
would be a great time :-) I especially need help on writingStuff the Internet
Says on Scalabilityas I won't even be reading the Interwebs. Shock! Horror! So
if the spirit moves you, please write something. My connectivity in South
Africa is unknown, but I will check in and approve articles when I can. See

<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble in an often poignantFriendFeed threadcommiserating PodTech's
unfortunate end, shared what he learned about creating a successful startup.
Here's a summary of a Robert's rules and why Machiavelli just may agree with
them:Have a story.Have everyone on board with that story.If anyone goes off of
that story, make sure they get on board immediately or fire them.Make sure
people are judged by the revenues they bring in. Those that bring in revenues
should get to run the place. People who don't bring in revenues should get
fewer and fewer responsibilities, not more and more.Work ONLY for a leader who
will make the tough decisions.Build a place where excellence is expected,
allowed, and is enabled.Fire idiots quickly.If your engineering team can't
give a media team good measurements, the entire company is in trouble. Only
things that are measured ever get improved.When your stars aren't listened to
the company is in trouble.Getting rid of the CEO, even if it's all his fault,

<p>Introduction: If you've wondered why I haven't been posting lately it's because I've been on
an amazingBeach's motorcycle tourof theAlps(and,and,and,and,and,and,and,and).
My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.The trip was
more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after
mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent
Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling
local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the
winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system,
listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank
water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local
German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of
fellow riders. Magical.They say you'll ride more twists and turns on this trip

<p>Introduction: Over the years I've read a lot of research papers looking for better ways of
doing things. Sometimes I find ideas I can use, but more often than not I come
up empty. The problem is there are very few good papers. And by good I mean:
can a reasonably intelligent person read a paper and turn it into something
useful? Now, clearly I'm not an academic and clearly I'm no genius, I'm just
an everyday programmer searching for leverage, and as a common specimen of the
species I've often thought how much better our industry would be if we could
simply move research from academia into production with some sort of self-
conscious professionalism. Currently the process is horribly hit or miss. And
this problem extends equally to companies with research divisions that often
do very little to help front-line developers succeed. How many ideas break out
of academia into industry in computer science? We have many brilliant
examples: encryption, microprocessors, compression, transactions, distributed

<p>Introduction: Gordon Ramsayis a world renowned chef with a surprising amount to say on
software development. Well, he says it about cooking and running a restaurant,
but it applies to software development too.You may have seen Gordon Ramsay on
one of his many TV shows. Hell's Kitchen is a competition between chefs trying
to win a dream job: head chef of their own high-end restaurant. On this show
Ramsay is judge, jury, and executioner. And he chops off more than a few
heads. Kitchen Nightmares is a show where Ramsay is called in by restaurant
owners to help turn around their failing restaurants. On this show Ramsay is
there to help.If you just watch Hell's Kitchen you will likely conclude Ramsay
is one of the devil's own helpers ("ram" is the symbol of the devil and "say"
means he speaks for the devil: Ramsay). Ramsay screams, yells, cusses,
belittles, and throws tantrums even a 7 year old could learn from. Then he
does it all over gain just for spite. In Hell's Kitchen there's no evidence at

<p>Introduction: eAcceleratoris a free open-source PHP accelerator, optimizer, and dynamic
content cache. It increases the performance of PHP scripts by caching them in
their compiled state, so that the overhead of compiling is almost completely
eliminated. It also optimizes scripts to speed up their execution.
eAccelerator typically reduces server load and increases the speed of your PHP
code by 1-10 times.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.83517134 <a title="1503-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-19-What_can_the_Amazing_Race_to_the_South_Pole_Teach_us_About_Startups%3F.html">1503 high scalability-2013-08-19-What can the Amazing Race to the South Pole Teach us About Startups?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the heart of every software adventure exists a journey in service of a
quest. Melodramatic much? Sorry, but while wandering dazzled throughRace to
the End of the Earth, a fantastic exhibit at theRoyal BC Museumon the
1911-1912race to the South Polebetween Norwegian explorerRoald Amundsenand
British naval officerRobert Scott, I couldn't help but think of the two
radically different approaches each team took to the race and it shocked me to
see that some of the same principles that lead to success or failure in
software development also seem to lead to success or failure in exploration.I
wish I could reproduce the experience ofwalking through the exhibit. Plaque
after plaque I remember wondering out loud at Scott's choices and then nod in
agreement with Amundsen's approach. The core conflict was straight out of any
ancient Agile (Amundsen) vs Waterfall (Scott) thread you can find on Usenet.
And Waterfall lost.As background here are some sources you may want to read to

<p>Introduction: Brian Zimmer, architect at travel startup Yapta, highlights some worst
practices jeopardizing the growth and scalability of a system:* The Golden
Hammer. Forcing a particular technology to work in ways it was not intended is
sometimes counter-productive. Using a database to store key-value pairs is one
example. Another example is using threads to program for concurrency.*
Resource Abuse. Manage the availability of shared resources because when they
fail, by definition, their failure is experienced pervasively rather than in
isolation. For example, connection management to the database through a thread
pool.* Big Ball of Mud. Failure to manage dependencies inhibits agility and
scalability.* Everything or Something. In both code and application dependency
management, the worst practice is not understanding the relationships and
formulating a model to facilitate their management. Failure to enforce
diligent control is a contributing scalability inhibiter.* Forgetting to check
the time. To</p><p>5 0.62281829 <a title="1503-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-03-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_3%2C_2012.html">1187 high scalability-2012-02-03-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 3, 2012</a></p>

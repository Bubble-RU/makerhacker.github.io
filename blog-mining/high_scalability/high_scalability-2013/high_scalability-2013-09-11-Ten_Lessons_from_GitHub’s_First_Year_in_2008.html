<p>Introduction: Twitter has a big hairy audacious goal of reaching one billion users  by 2013. Three forces stand against Twitter. The world will end in  2012 . But let's be optimistic and assume we'll make it. Next is Facebook. Currently Facebook is the user leader with over  400 million users . Will Facebook stumble or will they rocket to one billion users before Twitter? And lastly, there's Twitter's "low" starting point and "slow" growth rate. Twitter currently has  106 million  registered users and adds about 300,000 new users a day. That doesn't add up to a billion in three years. Twitter needs to triple the number of registered users they add per day. How will Twitter reach its goal of over one billion users served?
 
From recent infrastructure announcements and information gleaned at  Chirp  ( videos ) and other talks, it has become a little clearer how they hope to reach their billion user goal: 1) Make a Big Hairy Audacious Goal 2) Hire Lots of Quality People 3) Hug Developers and Users 4) D</p><p>3 0.092081942 <a title="1515-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-04-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_4%2C_2012.html">1239 high scalability-2012-05-04-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 4, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Tom Preston-Werner , GitHub Cofounder, wrote  Ten Lessons from GitHub’s First Year  in 2008. Though the lessons are still relevant, and the war stories behind each lesson are great, I can't help but wonder what a 2013 version would look like?

<p>Introduction: One of the most popular and effective scalability strategies is to impose limits (  GAE Quotas  ,   Fotolog  ,   Facebook  ) as a means of protecting a website against service destroying   traffic spikes  . Twitter will reportedly   limit the number followers   to 2,000 in order to thwart follow spam. This may also allow Twitter to make some bank by   going freemium   and charging for adding more followers.     Agree or disagree with Twitter's strategies, the more interesting aspect for me is how do you introduce new policies into an already established ecosystem?      One approach is the big bang. Introduce all changes at once and let everyone adjust. If users don't like it they can move on. The hope is, however, most users won't be impacted by the changes and that those who are will understand it's all for the greater good of their beloved service. Casualties are assumed, but the damage will probably be minor.      Now in Twitter's case the people with the most followers tend to be o</p><p>3 0.77760547 <a title="1515-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-27-Solving_the_Client_Side_API_Scalability_Problem_with_a_Little_Game_Theory.html">166 high scalability-2007-11-27-Solving the Client Side API Scalability Problem with a Little Game Theory</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Now that the internet has become defined as a mashup over a collection of service APIs, we have a little problem: for clients using APIs is a lot like drinking beer through a straw.  You never get as much beer as you want and you get a headache after. But what if I've been a good boy and deserve a bigger straw? Maybe we can use game theory to model trust relationships over a life time of interactions over many different services and then give more capabilities/beer to those who have earned them?        Let's say Twitter limits me to downloading only 20 tweets at a time through their API. But I want more. I may even want to do something so radical as download all my tweets. Of course Twitter can't let everyone do that. They would be swamped serving all this traffic and service would be denied. So Twitter does that rational thing and limits API access as a means of self protection. As does Google, Yahoo,   Skynet  ,  and everyone else.

You may have seen Gordon Ramsay on one of his many TV shows. Hell's Kitchen is a competition between chefs trying to win a dream job: head chef of their own high-end restaurant. On this show Ramsay is judge, jury, and executioner. And he chops off more than a few heads. Kitchen Nightmares is a show where Ramsay is called in by restaurant owners to help turn around their failing restaurants. On this show Ramsay is there to help.
 
If you just watch Hell's Kitchen you will likely conclude Ramsay is one of the devil's own helpers ("ram" is the symbol of the devil and "say" means he speaks for the devil: Ramsay). Ramsay screams, yells, cusses, belittles, and throws tantrums even a 7 year old could learn from. Then he does it all over gain just for spite. In Hell's Kitchen there's no evidence a</p><p>5 0.74541658 <a title="1515-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-07-Six_Ways_Twitter_May_Reach_its_Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal_of_One_Billion_Users.html">837 high scalability-2010-06-07-Six Ways Twitter May Reach its Big Hairy Audacious Goal of One Billion Users</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Twitter has a big hairy audacious goal of reaching one billion users  by 2013. Three forces stand against Twitter. The world will end in  2012 . But let's be optimistic and assume we'll make it. Next is Facebook. Currently Facebook is the user leader with over  400 million users . Will Facebook stumble or will they rocket to one billion users before Twitter? And lastly, there's Twitter's "low" starting point and "slow" growth rate. Twitter currently has  106 million  registered users and adds about 300,000 new users a day. That doesn't add up to a billion in three years. Twitter needs to triple the number of registered users they add per day. How will Twitter reach its goal of over one billion users served?
 
From recent infrastructure announcements and information gleaned at  Chirp  ( videos ) and other talks, it has become a little clearer how they hope to reach their billion user goal: 1) Make a Big Hairy Audacious Goal 2) Hire Lots of Quality People 3) Hug Developers and Users 4) D</p><p>6 0.73973471 <a title="1515-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-11-Yahoo_Live%27s_Scaling_Problems_Prove%3A_Release_Early_and_Often_-_Just_Don%27t_Screw_Up.html">244 high scalability-2008-02-11-Yahoo Live's Scaling Problems Prove: Release Early and Often - Just Don't Screw Up</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Tom Preston-Werner , GitHub Cofounder, wrote  Ten Lessons from GitHub’s First Year  in 2008. Though the lessons are still relevant, and the war stories behind each lesson are great, I can't help but wonder what a 2013 version would look like?
  
   Start Early -  GitHub created a market that didn't exist. By building early "on top of a nascent technology, we were able to construct a startup with basically no overhead, no competition, and in our free time." 
   Adapt to Your Customers - " Don’t give your customers what they ask for; give them what they want." 
   Have Fun -  "You have to goof off a lot in order to balance things out. Burnout is a real and dangerous phenomenon. " 
   Pay attention to Twitter -  "Twitter [is] an extremely valuable resource for instant feedback." 
   Deploy at Will! -  "The first year of a web offering is a magical one. Your customers are most likely early adopters and love to see new features roll out every few weeks.

 Northscale introduces  Membase , a new distributed key-value NoSQL competitor featuring a memcache compatible interface, yet is persistent like a database. Hopefully we'll have more on their internals later. 
 Notable Tweets:     
 
  Aaron Cordova  -  scalability means "can change size" and also "works at large sizes" - this conflates two orthogonal features of cloud computing.   
  Jaime Garcia Reinoso  - I t's the scalability, stupid!   
  Alex Averbuch   - when I read/hear "unlimited/inifinite scalability" I stop reading/listening and start thinking about cake.  
  Dennis Clark   - I used to smirk at developers whose main DB experience was in MUMPS or Pick, until I realized those are old-school  #NoSQL  engines.

 Quotable Quotes:                             
 
  @muratdemirbas : In the cloudcomputing webservices domain antifragility= elastic scalability + network effect 
  @SQLPerfTips : More hardware won't solve response time problems. Proper indexing does. 
  Stefan Boberg : The fastest I/O request is the one you dont'! 
  Alan Kay : The key in making great and growable systems is much more to design how its modules communicate rather than what their internal properties and behaviors should be. 
  antirez : One thing, more than everything else, keeps me focused while programming: never interrupt the flow.

<p>Introduction: Scalr   is a fully redundant, self-curing and self-scaling hosting environment utilizing Amazon's EC2. It has been recently open sourced on Google Code.     Scalr allows you to create server farms through a web-based interface using prebuilt AMI's for load balancers (pound or nginx), app servers (apache, others), databases (mysql master-slave, others), and a generic AMI to build on top of.   Scalr promises automatic high-availability and scaling for developers by health and load monitoring.     The health of the farm is continuously monitored and maintained. When the Load Average on a type of node goes above a configurable threshold a new node is inserted into the farm to spread the load and the cluster is reconfigured. When a node crashes a new machine of that type is inserted into the farm to replace it.       4 AMI's are provided for load balancers, mysql databases, application servers, and a generic base image to customize. Scalr allows you to further customize each image, bundle t</p><p>6 0.85274637 <a title="1515-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-29-Amazon%3A_Creating_a_Customer_Utopia_One_Culture_Hack_at_a_Time.html">1466 high scalability-2013-05-29-Amazon: Creating a Customer Utopia One Culture Hack at a Time</a></p>

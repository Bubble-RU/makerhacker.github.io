[sent-13, score-0.331]
</p><p>2 Make a note of the security group you assign to the instances and the region you deployed them in. [sent-22, score-0.342]
</p><p>3 Select the region you wish to deploy to, ensuring that the region you choose is the same region containing your test client instances (created in step 1). [sent-41, score-1.006]
</p><p>4 For this test we will choose Instaclustr's professional tier as it roughly corresponds to the same price as DynamoDB's highest capacity table you can request without needing to ask Amazon to increase your account limits. [sent-42, score-0.334]
</p><p>5 Click on security groups and allowAll TCP,All UDPandAll IMCPpackets between the test client security group you selected in step 1 and your Instaclustr security group (called instaclustr-yourname- yourclustername-group). [sent-57, score-0.84]
</p><p>6 If you created your test clients in a different region to us-east1 change the DynamoDB endpoint to match and leave the rest of the settings as is. [sent-66, score-0.374]
</p><p>7 Your dynamodb properties file should contain something similar to the following:dynamodb. [sent-67, score-0.457]
</p><p>8 On one of your test client instances run the following command, replacing ec2 -XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX. [sent-79, score-0.664]
</p><p>9 0 and caching = 'ALL'; QUIT;On each of your test client instances, create a file in the ~/YCSB directory called Cassandra. [sent-87, score-0.727]
</p><p>10 For each separate test client set theinsertstartproperty to be0,2500000,5000000and7500000respectively. [sent-89, score-0.565]
</p><p>11 Again, for each separate test client set theinsertstartproperty to be0,2500000,5000000and7500000respectively. [sent-107, score-0.565]
</p><p>12 So it should look something like this:recordcount=10000000 insertstart=0 # This should be different for each client instance insertcount=2500000If you are using a single test client you can leave insertstart and insertcount out of both files. [sent-108, score-0.982]
</p><p>13 On each test client instance, from inside the ~/YCSB directory, run:. [sent-110, score-0.399]
</p><p>14 resultsThis command tells YCSB to run theloadcomponent of workload A (which inserts data that subsequent tests rely on) using the cassandra-1. [sent-113, score-0.402]
</p><p>15 props), use 50 client threads (-threads 50) and output status updates to stderr and test results to the loaddata-cassandra. [sent-115, score-0.525]
</p><p>16 This will load data into Instaclustr and test its write throughput. [sent-118, score-0.337]
</p><p>17 YCSB will output status updates about the test every 10 seconds during the test. [sent-119, score-0.342]
</p><p>18 Each workload is split into a load and run portion. [sent-126, score-0.35]
</p><p>19 The load component will pre-fill the database with the required data and the run component will perform the workload to be measured. [sent-127, score-0.35]
</p><p>20 For example the run portion of workload A (which we used to load some data) consists of a 50 / 50 split of read and write operations. [sent-128, score-0.446]

<p>Introduction: My impression of DynamoDB before attending aAmazon DynamoDB for Developerstalk
is that it's the usual quality service produced by Amazon: simple, fast,
scalable, geographically redundant, expensive enough to make you think twice
about using it, and delightfully NoOp.After the talk my impression has become
more nuanced. The quality impression still stands. Look at theforumsand you'll
see the typical issues every product has, but no real surprises. And as a
SimpleDB++, DynamoDB seems to have avoided second system syndrome and produced
a more elegant design.What was surprising is how un-cloudy DynamoDB appears to
be. The cloud pillars of pay for what you use and quick elastic response to
bursty traffic have been abandoned, for some understandable reasons, but the
result is you really have to consider your use cases before making DynamoDB
the default choice.Here are some of my impressions from the talk...DynamoDB is
a clean well lighted place for key-value data. The interface is simple,

runsTripAdvisor's Technical Operations team, Luke and Victor interned on his
team this past summer. This post is introduced byAndy Gelfond, TripAdvisor's
head of engineering.It's been a little over a year since our last post about
theTripAdvisor architecture. It has been an exciting year. Our business and
team continues to grow, we are now an independent public company, and we have
continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown -
we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work
across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:56M visitors per
month350M+ pages requests a day120TB+ of warehouse data running on a large
Hadoop cluster, and quickly growingWe also had a very successful college

<p>Introduction: This is a repost of the blog entry written by NuoDB's Tommy Reilly.  We
atNuoDBwere recently given the opportunity to kick the tires on the Google
Compute Engine by our friends over at Google. You can watch the entire Google
Developer Live Session by clickinghere.  In order to access the capabilities
of GCE we decided to run the same YCSB based benchmark we ran at our General
Availability Launch back in January. For those of you who missed it we
demonstrated running the YCSB benchmark on a 24 machine cluster running on our
private cloud in the NuoDB datacenter. The salient results were 1.7 million
transactions per second with sub-millisecond latencies.Public cloud
environments typically mean virtualization, inconsistent network performance
and potentially slow or low bandwidth disk access. It just so happens that
NuoDB was designed to work well in such harsh environments (we don't call it a
cloud database for nothing). Still, the faster the CPU, network and disk the
faster the database</p><p>5 0.12012128 <a title="1434-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-07-Hypertable_Routs_HBase_in_Performance_Test_--_HBase_Overwhelmed_by_Garbage_Collection.html">1189 high scalability-2012-02-07-Hypertable Routs HBase in Performance Test -- HBase Overwhelmed by Garbage Collection</a></p>

of Hypertable, Inc.Hypertable delivers 2X better throughput in most tests --
HBase fails 41 and 167 billion record insert tests, overwhelmed by garbage
collection -- Both systems deliver similar results for random read uniform

(@hypertable) version 0.9.5.5 to that of HBase (@HBase) version 0.90.4
(CDH3u2) running Zookeeper 3.3.4.  In this post, we summarize the results and
offer explanations for the discrepancies. For the full test report,
seeHypertable vs. HBase II.IntroductionHypertable and HBase are both open
source, scalable databases modeled after Google's proprietary Bigtable
database.  The primary difference between the two systems is that Hypertable
is written in C++, while HBase is written in Java.  We modeled this test after
the one described in section 7 of theBigtable paperand tuned both systems for

professional and social content. One of the biggest jobs was to enable a fast
scalable architecture, because it was really difficult to forecast the traffic
load at production time. Traffic load may be influenced if the service
receives attention from users as a result of advertising.Below you will find a

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.How do you scale anAWS(Amazon Web Services) infrastructure?
This article will give you a detailed reply in two parts: the tools you can
use to make the most of Amazon's dynamic approach, and the architectural model
you should adopt for a scalable infrastructure.I base my report on my
experience gained in several AWS production projects in casual gaming
(Facebook), e-commerce infrastructures and within the mainstream GIS
(Geographic Information System). It's true that my experience in gaming
(IsCool, The Game) is currently the most representative in terms of
scalability, due to the number of users (over 800 thousand DAU - daily active
users - at peak usage and over 20 million page views every day), however my

<p>Introduction: Authored by Chris Fregly:  Former Netflix Streaming Platform Engineer, AWS
Certified Solution Architect and Purveyor of fluxcapacitor.com.Ahead of the
upcoming 2nd annual re:Invent conference, inspired by Simone Brunozzi's
recentpresentationat an AWS Meetup in San Francisco, and collected from a few
of my recentFluxcapacitor.com consulting engagements, I've compiled a list of
10 useful time and clock-tick saving tips about AWS.1) Query AWS resource
metadata Can't remember the EBS-Optimized IO throughput of your c1.xlarge
cluster?  How about the size limit of an S3 object on a single PUT?
awsnow.infois the answer to all of your AWS-resource metadata questions.
Interested in integrating awsnow.info with your application?  You're in luck.
There's now aREST API, as well!Note:  These are default soft limits and will
vary by account.2) Tame your S3 buckets Delete an entire S3 bucket with a
single CLI command:  aws s3 rb s3://\--forceRecursively copy a

runsTripAdvisor's Technical Operations team, Luke and Victor interned on his
team this past summer. This post is introduced byAndy Gelfond, TripAdvisor's
head of engineering.It's been a little over a year since our last post about
theTripAdvisor architecture. It has been an exciting year. Our business and
team continues to grow, we are now an independent public company, and we have
continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown -
we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work
across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:56M visitors per
month350M+ pages requests a day120TB+ of warehouse data running on a large
Hadoop cluster, and quickly growingWe also had a very successful college
intern program that brought on over 60 interns this past summer, all who were
quickly on boarded and doing the same kind of work as our full time
engineers.One recurri</p><p>6 0.67308527 <a title="1434-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-07-Hypertable_Routs_HBase_in_Performance_Test_--_HBase_Overwhelmed_by_Garbage_Collection.html">1189 high scalability-2012-02-07-Hypertable Routs HBase in Performance Test -- HBase Overwhelmed by Garbage Collection</a></p>

<p>Introduction: From their website:FAIis an automated installation tool to install or deploy
Debian GNU/Linux and other distributions on a bunch of different hosts or a
Cluster. It's more flexible than other tools like kickstart for Red Hat,
autoyast and alice for SuSE or Jumpstart for SUN Solaris. FAI can also be used
for configuration management of a running system.You can take one or more
virgin PCs, turn on the power and after a few minutes Linux is installed,
configured and running on all your machines, without any interaction
necessary. FAI it's a scalable method for installing and updating all your
computers unattended with little effort involved. It's a centralized
management system for your Linux deployment.breakFAI's target group are system
administrators who have to install Linux onto one or even hundreds of
computers. It's not only a tool for doing a Cluster installation but a general
purpose installation tool. It can be used for installing a Beowulf cluster, a

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byBen BromheadfromInstaclustrDeciding to use a managed
NoSQL datastore is a great step in ensuring you run a fast, scalable and
resilient application without needing to be an expert in highly available
architecture. How do you know which technology is the best for your
application? How do you know whether the provider's performance claims are
true? You are putting your application on someone else’s infrastructure and
that requires some hard answers about their claims.To determine the
suitability of a provider, your first port of call is to benchmark. Choosing a
service provider is often done in a number of stages. First is to shortlist
providers based on capabilities and claimed performance, ruling out those that
do not meet your application requirements. Second is to look for benchmarks
conducted by third parties, if any. The final stage is to benchmark the
service yourself.In this article we will show you how to run some preliminary
benchmarks against two managed</p><p>4 0.89441556 <a title="1434-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-31-Pud_is_the_Anti-Stack_-_Windows%2C_CFML%2C_Dropbox%2C_Xeround%2C_JungleDisk%2C_ELB.html">1108 high scalability-2011-08-31-Pud is the Anti-Stack - Windows, CFML, Dropbox, Xeround, JungleDisk, ELB</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pud off*ckedcomany.com (FC) fame, a favorite site of the dot bomb era, and a
site I absolutely loved until my company became featured, has given us a look
at his backend: Why Must You Laugh At My Back End. For those whose don't
remember FC's history, TechCrunch published afitting eulogy:[FC] first went
live in 2000, chronicling failing and troubled companies in its unique and
abrasive style after the dot com bust. Within a year it had a massive audience
and was getting serious mainstream press attention. As the startup economy
became better in 2004, much of the attention the site received went away. But
a large and loyal audience remains at the site, coming back day after day for
its unique slant on the news. At its peak, FC had 4 million unique monthly
visitors.Delightfully, FC was not a real-names kind of site. Hard witty
cynicism ruled and not a single cat picture was in sight. It was a blast of
fun when all around was the enclosing dark.So when I saw Pud's post I was

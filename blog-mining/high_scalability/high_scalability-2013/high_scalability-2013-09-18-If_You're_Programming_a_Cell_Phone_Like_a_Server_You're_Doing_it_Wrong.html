</p><p>2 Key idea: The cell radio is one of the biggest battery drains on a phone. [sent-20, score-1.165]
</p><p>3 To minimize radio usage and thus minimize power usage you must first understand how a cell radio works. [sent-27, score-1.718]
</p><p>4 To send data the radio transitions to Full Power mode, a process that takes 2 seconds beforeperforming the transfer. [sent-32, score-0.818]
</p><p>5 For every data transfer the radio stays on for 5 seconds at full power followed by 10-60 seconds at a lower power state before returning to Standby. [sent-45, score-1.414]
</p><p>6 Every time you transfer data you are powering the radio for at least 20 seconds. [sent-46, score-0.799]
</p><p>7 The videos go into a number of techniques to bring about balance:Minimize the number of radio state transitions. [sent-53, score-0.726]
</p><p>8 Determine your applications battery usage profileGenerate graphs using: Logcat logging / Application Resource Optimizer / Network Statistics in DDMSAnalyze graph for battery inefficienciesLook for regular pattern of transfers. [sent-54, score-0.803]
</p><p>9 This will cause regular radio usage and power drain. [sent-55, score-0.753]
</p><p>10 By downloading all the data a user is likely to need in a single burst over a single connection at full capacity, the number of radio activations is significantly reduced. [sent-60, score-0.774]
</p><p>11 It's more efficient to have transfers occur when a radio is in its active state, so if a time sensitive transfer is initiated, look to preempt, by transferring the data now, any transfers that will need to occur in a few minutes. [sent-68, score-1.283]
</p><p>12 For a news reader, the naive way is to download top level and thumbnails, this keeps the radio constantly busy. [sent-72, score-0.677]
</p><p>13 It transfers data in bursts rather than a continuous stream which would keep the radio constantly active. [sent-86, score-0.842]
</p><p>14 These videos make clear what may have not been clear before: programming cell radio based mobile devices is a specialized domain that takes some specialized knowledge and techniques to do well. [sent-103, score-0.932]
</p><p>15 dzamir: In fact iOS7 uses the same strategy described in this post: it wake ups all the applications that require a background download at the same time to minimize the time the radio is on. [sent-107, score-0.843]
</p><p>16 If you know that using the mobile radio in a certain way is a source of excessive battery usage, it's silly to just disregard this information. [sent-122, score-0.991]
</p><p>17 The mobile radio will eat your battery very quickly, and probably chews through as much power as your screen. [sent-124, score-1.141]
</p><p>18 The keep-alive packets will keep your mobile radio in a higher power state, pretty much in the same way some disrespectful apps do and you'll (quite unsurprisingly) see your battery drain faster. [sent-127, score-1.316]
</p><p>19 In the phone API's, if I need to do a background update, I should be able to register with the OS, and say, I have an update to do, within the next 15 minutes, let me know when you have an active radio connection. [sent-156, score-0.733]
</p><p>20 You're phone goes into a high powered radio connection, and bam, all you're background updates now go out together. [sent-157, score-0.733]

<p>Introduction: A consequence of Service Oriented Architectures is the burning need to provide
services at scale. The architecture that has evolved to satisfy these
requirements is a little known technique called the Cell Architecture.A Cell
Architecture is based on the idea that massive scale requires parallelization
and parallelization requires components be isolated from each other. These
islands of isolation are called cells. A cell is a self-contained installation
that can satisfy all the operations for a shard. A shard is a subset of a much
larger dataset, typically a range of users, for example. Cell Architectures
have several advantages:Cells provide a unit of parallelization that can be
adjusted to any size as the user base grows.Cell are added in an incremental
fashion as more capacity is required.Cells isolate failures. One cell failure
does not impact other cells.Cells provide isolation as the storage and
application horsepower to process requests is independent of other cells.Cells

<p>Introduction: In 5 Lessons We've Learned Using AWS, Netflix's John Ciancutti says one of the
big lessons they've learned is to create lesschatty protocols:In the Netflix
data centers, we have a high capacity, super fast, highly reliable network.
This has afforded us the luxury of designing around chatty APIs to remote
systems. AWS networking has more variable latency. We've had to be much more
structured about "over the wire" interactions, even as we've transitioned to a
more highly distributed architecture.There's not a lot of advice out there on
how to create protocols. Combine that with a rush to the cloud and you have a
perfect storm for chatty applications crushing application performance.
Netflix is far from the first to be surprised by the less than stellar
networks inside AWS. A chatty protocol is one where a client makes a series of
requests to a server and the client must wait on each reply before sending the
next request. On a LAN this can work great. LAN's are typically fast, wide,

<p>Introduction: If you were going to design a next generation Internet at the physical layer
that routes around the current Internet, what would it look like? What should
it do? How should it work? Who should own it? How should it be paid for? How
would you access it?It has long been said the Internet routes around
obstacles. Snowden has revealed some major obstacles. The beauty of the
current current app and web system is the physical network doesn't matter. We
can just replace it with something else. Something that doesn't flow through
choke points like backhaul networks,under sea cables, andcell towers. What
might that something else look like?Google's Loon ProjectProject Loonwas so
named because the idea was thought to be loony. Maybe not.The idea is to float
high-altitude balloons 20 miles in the air to create an aerial wireless

<p>Introduction: When two titans of the early computing industry, Apple co-founder Steve
Wozniakand Atari founderNolan Bushnell, had a chance to sit down for a chat at
the C2SVconference last Friday, we learned how a little foresight and luck can
decide futures.  Steve Wozniak's Success - Expandability  Steve talked about
how the Apple II was the primary source of revenue for Apple's first 10 years
of life. The reason the Apple II could last so long was that it was
expandable. It hadeight expansion slotsand the RAM was also expandable
(starting at 4K). No computer at the time had this kind of flexibility
orexpansion capabilities. Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs argued over keeping the
Apple II open. Jobs wanted closed, Wozniak wanted open and fortunately Wozniak
won.  In fact, the Apple II was completely open (those were the days). They
published the complete specs before there was anything like a developer
community. So even though the Apple III, Lisa, and the Macintosh all failed,

<p>Introduction: Power on a cell phone is like water in a desert. It's the very stuff of life.
If you take the same naive programming techniques you learned when programming
on a server in a datacenter your cell phone will die of thirst.This is
dramatically shown byReto Meier, Tech Lead for the Android Developer Relations
Team, in a remarkable series of instructional videos:DevBytes: Efficient Data
Transfers - Understanding the Cell RadioDevBytes: Efficient Data Transfers -
Analyzing Your Transfer ProfileDevBytes: Efficient Data Transfers - Effective

SyncAdaptersRemarkable because these videos are short, to the point, and
chocked full of useful ideas and techniques. Though Android is targeted
specifically, most of content should be generally useful.As an example of how
server programming differs from mobile programming, on a server copying a file
from one server to another server is usually a one or two liner. Read a block

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Rodrigo Guzman, CTO ofiDoneThis, which makes status
reporting happen at your company with the lightest possible touch.iDoneThisis
a simple management application that emails your team at the end of every day
to ask, "What'd you get done today?" Just reply with a few lines of what you
got done. The following morning everyone on your team gets a digest with what
the team accomplished the previous day to keep everyone in the loop and
kickstart another awesome day.Before we launched, we built iDoneThis over a
weekend in the most rudimentary way possible. I kid you not, we sent the first
few batches of daily emails using the BCC field of a Gmail inbox. The upshot
is that we've had users on the site from Day 3 of its existence on.We've gone
from launch in January 2011 when we sent hundreds of emails out per day by
hand to sending out over 1 million emails and handling over 200,000 incoming
emails per month. In total, customers have recorded over 1.7 million

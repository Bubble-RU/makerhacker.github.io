<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve?

<p>Introduction: Chris Dixonunearthed agreat quotefrom Douglas Adams on the nature of
technological adoption that unsurprisingly hits the mark in our ever changing
and evolving world:Anything that is in the world when you're born is normal
and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.Anything
that's invented between when you're fifteen and thirty-five is new and
exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.Anything
invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of thingsSome
that come to mind: horse to car, index card to online search, PC to mobile,
web to app, portal to messaging, Newton to Einstein, oil to electric, rock to
rap, Aquinas to Bacon, buying to renting, files to streaming, network TV to
cordkilling, broadcast to social, programming CPUs to programming biology,
server to cloud, vm to container, wired to wireless, long read to TLDR,
privacy to public to ephemeral, paper based news aggregation to digital
aggregation, checks to onlin</p><p>2 0.95021194 <a title="1527-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-30-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_30%2C_2012.html">1219 high scalability-2012-03-30-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 30, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.We tend to think compute
of resources as residing primarily in datacenters. Given the fast pace of
innovation we will likely see compute resources become pervasive. Some will
reside in datacenters, but compute resources can be anywhere, not just in the
datacenter, we'll actually see the bulk of compute resources live outside of
datacenters in the future.Given the diversity of compute resources it's
reasonable to assume they won't be homogeneous or conform to a standard API.
They will specialize by service. Programmers will have to use those
specialized service interfaces to build applications that are adaptive enough
to take advantage of whatever leverage they can find, whenever and wherever
they can find it. Once found the application will have to reorganize on the
fly to use whatever new resources it has found and let go of whatever
resources it doesn't have</p><p>5 0.91101998 <a title="1527-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-25-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_November_25%2C_2011.html">1147 high scalability-2011-11-25-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For November 25, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.How do you scale anAWS(Amazon Web Services) infrastructure?
This article will give you a detailed reply in two parts: the tools you can
use to make the most of Amazon's dynamic approach, and the architectural model
you should adopt for a scalable infrastructure.I base my report on my
experience gained in several AWS production projects in casual gaming
(Facebook), e-commerce infrastructures and within the mainstream GIS
(Geographic Information System). It's true that my experience in gaming
(IsCool, The Game) is currently the most representative in terms of
scalability, due to the number of users (over 800 thousand DAU - daily active
users - at peak usage and over 20 million page views every day), however my
experiences in e-commerce and GIS (currently underway) provide a different
view of scalability, taking into account the various problems of availability
and data management. I will therefore</p><p>5 0.14700098 <a title="1408-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-04-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_October_5%2C_2012.html">1334 high scalability-2012-10-04-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For October 5, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is guest post byMichael DeHaan(@laserllama), a software developer and
architect, on Ansible, a simple deployment, model-driven configuration
management, and command execution framework.I owe High Scalability a great
deal of credit for the idea behind my latest software project. I was reading
about how an older tool I helped create, Func, was used atTumblr, and it
kicked some ideas into gear. This article is about what happened from that
idea.My observation, which the article reinforced, was that many shops end up
using a configuration management tool (Puppet, Chef, cfengine), a separate
deployment tool (Capistrano, Fabric) and yet another separate ad-hoc task
execution tool (Func, pssh, etc) because one class of tool historically hasn't
been good at all three jobs.My other observation (not from the article) was
that the whole "infrastructure as code" movement, while revolutionary, and
definitely great for many, was probably secretly grating on a good number of
systems administrato</p><p>5 0.72804588 <a title="1408-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-05-Sprinkle_-_Provisioning_Tool_to_Build_Remote_Servers.html">461 high scalability-2008-12-05-Sprinkle - Provisioning Tool to Build Remote Servers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At37 SignalsJoshua Sierles describes how 37 Signals usesSprinkleto configure
their servers within EC2. Sprinkledefines a domain specific meta-language for
describing and processing the installation of software. You can find an
interesting discussion of Sprinkle's creation story by the creator himself,
Marcus Crafter, inSprinkle Some Powder!.Marcus divides provisioning tools into
two categories:Task Based- the tool issues a list of commands to run on the
remote system, either remotely via a network connection or smart
client.Policy/state Based- the tool determines what needs to be run on the
remote system by examining its current and final state.Sprinkle combines both
models together in a chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter approach using normal Ruby
code as the DSL (domain specific language) to declaratively describe remote
system configurations. 37 Signals likes the use of Ruby as the DSL because it
makes learning a separate syntax unnecessary. I've successfully done similar
things in Perl.</p><p>6 0.67926168 <a title="1408-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-13-AIDA%3A_Badoo%E2%80%99s_journey_into_Continuous_Integration.html">1531 high scalability-2013-10-13-AIDA: Badooâs journey into Continuous Integration</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Database normalization is a technique for designing relational database
schemas that ensures that the data is optimal for ad-hoc querying and that
modifications such as deletion or insertion of data does not lead to data
inconsistency. Database denormalization is the process of optimizing your
database for reads by creating redundant data. A consequence of
denormalization is that insertions or deletions could cause data inconsistency
if not uniformly applied to all redundant copies of the data within the
database.Read more on Carnage4life blog...</p><p>2 0.93235356 <a title="1408-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-07-Case_Study_on_Scaling_PaaS_infrastructure_.html">1260 high scalability-2012-06-07-Case Study on Scaling PaaS infrastructure </a></p>
<p>Introduction: In his blog post,Scaling WSO2 Stratos, Srinath Perera explains the scaling
architecture of the WSO2 Stratos Platform as a Service (PaaS) infrastructure.
It is explained as a series of solutions where every solution adds a new
concept to solve a specific problem found in the earlier solution.Overall,
WSO2 Stratos uses a combination of intelligent Load balancing and lazy loading
to scale up the architecture. More details about Stratos can be found from the
paper WSO2 Stratos: An Industrial Stack to Support Cloud Computing.
ProblemStratos is multi-tenanted. In other words, there are many tenants. Each
tenant generally represents an organization and isolated from other tenants,
where each tenant has his own users, resources, and permissions. Stratos
supports multiple PaaS services. Each PaaS service is actually a WSO2 Products
(e.g. AS, BPS, ESB etc.) offered as a service. Using those services, tenants
may deploy their own Web Services, Mediation logic, Workflows, and Gadgets
etc. WSO2 Str</p><p>3 0.92210519 <a title="1408-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-16-S3_Failed_Because_of_Authentication_Overload.html">249 high scalability-2008-02-16-S3 Failed Because of Authentication Overload</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Being an authentic human being is difficult and apparently authenticating all
those S3 requests can be a bit overwhelming as well. Amazon fingered a lot of
processor heavy authentication requests as the reason for their
downtime:breakEarly this morning, at 3:30am PST, we started seeing elevated
levels of authenticated requests from multiple users in one of our locations.
While we carefully monitor our overall request volumes and these remained
within normal ranges, we had not been monitoring the proportion of
authenticated requests. Importantly, these cryptographic requests consume more
resources per call than other request types.Shortly before 4:00am PST, we
began to see several other users significantly increase their volume of
authenticated calls. The last of these pushed the authentication service over
its maximum capacity before we could complete putting new capacity in place.
In addition to processing authenticated requests, the authentication service
also performs account valida</p><p>same-blog 4 0.91356313 <a title="1408-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-19-Puppet_monitoring%3A_how_to_monitor_the_success_or_failure_of_Puppet_runs__.html">1408 high scalability-2013-02-19-Puppet monitoring: how to monitor the success or failure of Puppet runs  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by LogicMonitor's Director of Tech Ops,Jesse Aukeman,
about the different ways they're monitoring the success or failure of Puppet
runs.If you are like us, you are running some type of linux configuration
management tool. The value of centralized configuration and deployment is well
known and hard to overstate. Puppetis our tool of choice. It is powerful and
works well for us, except when things don't go as planned. Failures of puppet
can be innocuous and cosmetic, or they can cause production issues, for
example when crucial updates do not get properly propagated.Why?In the most
innocuous cases, the puppet agent craps out (we run puppet agent via cron). As
nice as puppet is, we still need to goose it from time to time to get past
some sort of network or host resource issue. A more dangerous case is when an
administrator temporarily disables puppet runs on a host in order to perform
some test or administrative task and then forgets to reenable it. In either
case it</p><p>5 0.9029299 <a title="1408-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-30-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_September_30%2C_2011.html">1129 high scalability-2011-09-30-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For September 30, 2011</a></p>

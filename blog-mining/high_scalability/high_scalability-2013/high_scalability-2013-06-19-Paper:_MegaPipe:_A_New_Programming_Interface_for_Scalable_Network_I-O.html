<p>Introduction: Now that we have theC10K concurrent connection problemlicked, how do we level
up and support 10 million concurrent connections? Impossible you say. Nope,
systems right now are delivering 10 million concurrent connections using
techniques that are as radical as they may be unfamiliar.To learn how it's
done we turn toRobert Graham, CEO of Errata Security, and his absolutely
fantastic talk atShmoocon 2013calledC10M Defending The Internet At
Scale.Robert has a brilliant way of framing the problem that I've never heard
of before. He starts with a little bit of history, relating how Unix wasn't
originally designed to be a general server OS, it was designed to be a control
system for a telephone network. It was the telephone network that actually
transported the data so there was a clean separation between the control plane
and the data plane. Theproblem is we now use Unix servers as part of the data
plane, which we shouldn't do at all. If we were designing a kernel for

<p>Introduction: Awesome paper on how particular synchronization mechanisms scale on multi-core
architectures: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Synchronization but
Were Afraid to Ask.The goal is to pick a locking approach that doesn't degrade
as the number of cores increase. Like everything else in life, that doesn't
appear to be generically possible:None of the nine locking schemes we consider
consistently outperforms any other one, on all target architectures or
workloads. Strictly speaking, to seek optimality, a lock algorithm should thus
be selected based on the hardware platform and the expected workload.
Abstract:This paper presents the most exhaustive study of synchronization to
date. We span multiple layers, from hardware cache-coherence protocols up to
high-level concurrent software. We do so on different types architectures,
from single-socket - uniform and nonuniform - to multi-socket - directory and
broadcastbased - many-cores. We draw a set of observations that, roughly
speaking,</p><p>6 0.075416729 <a title="1478-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-12-Paper%3A_Network_Stack_Specialization_for_Performance_.html">1594 high scalability-2014-02-12-Paper: Network Stack Specialization for Performance </a></p>

<p>Introduction: My name isRussell Sullivan, I am the author of AlchemyDB: a highly flexible
NoSQL/SQL/DocumentStore/GraphDB-datastore built on top of redis. I have spent
the last several years trying to find a way to sanely house multiple
datastore-genres under one roof while (almost paradoxically) pushing
performance to its limits.I recently joined the NoSQL
companyAerospike(formerly Citrusleaf) with the goal of incrementally grafting
AlchemyDB's flexible data-modeling capabilities onto Aerospike's high-velocity
horizontally-scalable key-value data-fabric. We recently completed a peak-
performanceTPS optimization project: starting at 200K TPS, pushing to the
recent community edition launch at 500K TPS, and finally arriving at our 2012
goal:1M TPS on $5K hardware.Getting to one million over-the-wire client-server

<p>Introduction: Our last article on Disqus: How Disqus Went Realtime With 165K Messages Per
Second And Less Than .2 Seconds Latency, was a little out of date, but the
folks at Disqus have been busy implementing, not talking, so we don't know a
lot about what they are doing now, but we do have a short update in C1MM and
NGINXby John Watson and an article Trying out this Go thing.So Disqus has
grown a bit:1.3 billion unique visitors10 billion page views500 million users
engaged in discussions3 million communities25 million commentsThey are still
all about realtime, but Go replaced Python in their Realtime system:Original
Realtime backend was written in a pretty lightweight Python + gevent.The
realtime service is a hybrid of CPU intensive tasks + lots of network IO.
Gevent was handling the network IO without an issue, but at higher contention,
the CPU was choking everything. Switching over to Go removed that contention,

<p>Introduction: Awesome paper on how particular synchronization mechanisms scale on multi-core
architectures: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Synchronization but
Were Afraid to Ask.The goal is to pick a locking approach that doesn't degrade
as the number of cores increase. Like everything else in life, that doesn't
appear to be generically possible:None of the nine locking schemes we consider
consistently outperforms any other one, on all target architectures or
workloads. Strictly speaking, to seek optimality, a lock algorithm should thus
be selected based on the hardware platform and the expected workload.
Abstract:This paper presents the most exhaustive study of synchronization to
date. We span multiple layers, from hardware cache-coherence protocols up to
high-level concurrent software. We do so on different types architectures,
from single-socket - uniform and nonuniform - to multi-socket - directory and
broadcastbased - many-cores. We draw a set of observations that, roughly
speaking,</p><p>6 0.6882776 <a title="1478-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-23-Strategy%3A_Use_Linux_Taskset_to_Pin_Processes_or_Let_the_OS_Schedule_It%3F.html">1536 high scalability-2013-10-23-Strategy: Use Linux Taskset to Pin Processes or Let the OS Schedule It?</a></p>

performed a sophisticated weighting of their popularity based on page range,
trust authority, Alexa rank, Google hits, and number of comments. When all the

Joel on Software was number one, of course. The next few were: 2) Coding

<p>Introduction: An excellent article by Bryan Cantrill and Jeff Bonwick on how to write multi-
threaded code. With more processors and no magic bullet solution for how to
use them, knowing how to write multiprocessor code that doesn't screw up your
system is still a valuable skill. Some topics:Know your cold paths from your
hot paths.Intuition is frequently wrong--be data intensive.Know when--and when
not--to break up a lock.Be wary of readers/writer locks.Consider per-CPU
locking.Know when to broadcast--and when to signal.Learn to debug
postmortem.Design your systems to be composable.Don't use a semaphore where a
mutex would suffice.Consider memory retiring to implement per-chain hash-table
locks.Be aware of false sharing.Consider using nonblocking synchronization
routines to monitor contention.When reacquiring locks, consider using
generation counts to detect state change.Use wait- and lock-free structures
only if you absolutely must.Prepare for the thrill of victory--and the agony
of defeat.While I</p><p>3 0.85150307 <a title="1478-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-02-RFC_1925_-_The_Twelve_%28Timeless%29_Networking_Truths.html">1526 high scalability-2013-10-02-RFC 1925 - The Twelve (Timeless) Networking Truths</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The paper MegaPipe: A New Programming Interface for Scalable Network I/O
(video,slides) hits the common theme that if you want to go faster you need a
better car design, not just a better driver. So that's why the authors started
with a clean-slate and designed a network API from the ground up with support
for concurrent I/O, a requirement for achieving high performance while scaling
to large numbers of connections per thread, multiple cores, etc.  What they
created is MegaPipe, "a new network programming API for message-oriented
workloads to avoid the performance issues of BSD Socket API."The result:
MegaPipe outperforms baseline Linux between 29% (for long connections) and
582% (for short connections). MegaPipe improves the performance of a modiﬁed
version of memcached between 15% and 320%. For a workload based on real-world
HTTP traces, MegaPipe boosts the throughput of nginx by 75%.What's this most
excellent and interesting paper about?Message-oriented network workloads,

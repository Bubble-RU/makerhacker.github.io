<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ali Khajeh-Hosseini, Technical Lead at
PlanForCloud.com.  I read a recent blog post about TripAdvisor's experiment
with AWS where they attempted to process 700K HTTP requests per minute on a
replica of their live site. There was also an interesting blog post on
Pinterest's massive growth on AWS. These blogs highlighted exactly the types
of questions we're interested in, mainly:How much would it cost to deploy
System X on Cloud Y? e.g. how much would it cost to host TripAdvisor on the
AWS US-East cloud?Would it be cheaper to use deployment option X or Y? e.g.
would it be cheaper to use reserved instances, different types of instances,
different cloud providers...What happens to costs when the system grows? e.g.
Pinterest has around 410TB of data on S3, what if that keeps growing at a rate
of 25% every month, like it has been in the last 10 months?I created a couple
of deployments in PlanForCloud to explore these questions and the results are

<p>Introduction: There has been an update on Pinterest: Pinterest growth driven by Amazon cloud
scalability since our last post: A Short on the Pinterest Stack for Handling
3+ Million Users.With Pinterest we see a story very similar to that
ofInstagram. Huge growth, lots of users, lots of data, with remarkably few
employees, all on the cloud.While it's true that both Pinterest and Instagram
are not making great advances inscience and technology, that is more indicator
of the easy power of today's commodity environments rather than a sign of
Silicon Valley's lack of innovation. The numbers are so huge and the
valuations are so high we naturally want some sort of fundamental
technological revolution to underlie their growth. The revolution is more
subtle. It really is just that easy to attain such growth these days, if you
can execute on the right idea. Get used to it. This is the new normal.Here's

<p>Introduction: If you are aninsect, don't work at TripAdvisor, specialization is out. One of
the most commented on strategies from theTripAdvisor architecture article is
their rather opinionated take on the role of engineers in the
organization.Typically engineers live in a box. They are specialized, they do
database work and not much else, and they just do programming, not much else.
TripAdvisor takes the road less traveled:Engineers work across entire stack-
HTML, CSS, JS, Java, scripting. If you do not know something, you learn it.
The only thing that gets in the way of delivering your project is you, as you
are expected to work at all levels - design, code, test, monitoring, CSS, JS,
Java, SQL, scripting.We do not have "architects."  At TripAdvisor, if you
design something, your code it, and if you code it you test it. Engineers who
do not like to go outside their comfort zone, or who feel certain work is
"beneath" them will simply get in the way.A radical take for an established
organization. We</p><p>5 0.17350876 <a title="1480-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-14-A_TripAdvisor_Short.html">1059 high scalability-2011-06-14-A TripAdvisor Short</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sometimes I get article proposals and then there's no follow up. Though these
TripAdvisor data points are from 2010, I thought them worth sharing:Our site
serves in excess of 100M dynamically generated page view a day (all media and
static content goes through CDN), and we do this with about 100 machines, no
single point of failure, supported by distributed service architecture that
that responds to over 2B requests a day, and a data warehouse of over 20TB
that is used to drive email campaigns, SEM, and general reporting. We are a
Linux/Java/Apache/Tomcat/Postgres/Lucene shop, and have built our own
distributed computing architecture. We also maintain duplicate data centers
(one active, one standby) for redundancy and maintenance purposes.Too bad, it
sounds like it would have been a good article.Related Articles A new twist on

<p>Introduction: We've long known one of the virtues of the cloud is, through the magic of
services and automation, that systems can be shut or tuned down when not in
use. What may be surprising is how much money can be saved. This aspect of
cloudiness got a lot of pub atAWS re:Invent and is being rebranded under the
term Cost-Aware Architecture. Aninteresting examplewas given by Ryan Park,
Pinterest's technical operations lead:20% of their systems are shutdown after
hours in response to traffic loadsReserved instances are used for standard
traffic On-demand and spot instances are used to handle the elastic load
throughout the day. When more servers are needed for an auto-scaled service,
spot requests are opened and on-demand instances are started at the same time.
Most services are targeted to run at about 50% on-demand and 50% spot.Watchdog
processes continually check what's running. More instances are launched when
needed and terminated when not needed. If spot prices spike and spot instances
are sh</p><p>4 0.82698512 <a title="1480-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-19-Strategy%3A_Order_Two_Mediums_Instead_of_Two_Smalls_and_the_EC2_Buffet.html">812 high scalability-2010-04-19-Strategy: Order Two Mediums Instead of Two Smalls and the EC2 Buffet</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Vaibhav PuranikinWeb serving in the cloud - our experiences with nginx and
instance sizesdescribes their experience trying to maximum traffic and minimum
their web serving costs on EC2. Initially they tested with two m1.small
instance types and then they the switched to two c1.mediums instance types.
The m1s are the standard instance types and the c1s are the high CPU instance
types. Obviously the mediums have greater capability, but the cost difference
was interesting:In the long term they will save money using the larger
instances and not autoscaling. With the small instances, traffic bursts caused
autoscaling to kick in. New instances were started in response to load. The
instances woud be up for a short period of time and then spin down again. This
constant churn costs a lot of money. Selecting the larger instance sizes,
which are capable of handling the load without autoscaling, turn out to save
money even though they are more expensive. Starting new instances also takes a

<p>Introduction: ArchCamp: Scalable Databasess (NoSQL)The ArchCamp unconference was held this
past Friday at HackerDojo in Mountain View, CA.  There was plenty of pizza,
beer, and great conversation.  This session started out free-form, but shaped
up pretty quickly into a discussion of the popular open source scalable NoSQL
databases and the architectural categories in which they belong.</p><p>2 0.95990205 <a title="1480-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-26-Should_you_use_a_SAN_to_scale_your_architecture%3F_.html">430 high scalability-2008-10-26-Should you use a SAN to scale your architecture? </a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a question everyone must struggle with when building out their
datacenter. Storage choices are always the ones I have the least confidence
in. David Marks in his blogYou Can Change It Later!asks the questionShould I
get a SAN to scale my site architecture?and answers no. A better solution is
to use commodity hardware, directly attach storage on servers, and partition
across servers to scale and for greater availability.David's reasoning is
interesting:A SAN creates a SPOF (single point of failure) that is dependent
on a vendor to fly and fix when there's a problem. This can lead to long down
times during this outage you have no access to your data at all.Using easily
available commodity hardware minimizes risks to your company, it's not just
about saving money. Zooming over to Fry's to buy emergency equipment provides
the kind of agility startups need in order to respond quickly to ever changing
situations.It's hard to beat the power and flexibility (backups, easy to add

<p>Introduction: If you stayed up all night watching the life reaffirmingCuriosity landing on
Mars, then this paper,High-Performance Concurrency Control Mechanisms for
Main-Memory Databases, has nothing to do with that at all, but it is an
excellent look at how to use optimistic MVCC schemes to reduce lock overhead
on in-memory datastructures:A database system optimized for in-memory storage
can support much higher transaction rates than current systems. However,
standard concurrency control methods used today do not scale to the high
transaction rates achievable by such systems. In this paper we introduce two
efficient concurrency control methods specifically designed for main-memory
databases. Both use multiversioning to isolate read-only transactions from
updates but differ in how atomicity is ensured: one is optimistic and one is
pessimistic. To avoid expensive context switching, transactions never block
during normal processing but they may have to wait before commit to ensure
correct serializatio</p><p>5 0.95362931 <a title="1480-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-22-It%27s_the_Fraking_IOPS_-_1_SSD_is_44%2C000_IOPS%2C_Hard_Drive_is_180.html">1066 high scalability-2011-06-22-It's the Fraking IOPS - 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS, Hard Drive is 180</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Planning your next buildout and thinking SSDs are still far in the future?
Still too expensive, too low density. Hard disks are cheap, familiar, and
store lots of stuff. In this short and entertaining video Wikia's Artur
Bergmanwants to change your mind about SSDs. SSDs are for today, get with the
math already.Here's Artur's logic:Wikia is all SSD in production. The new
Wikia file servers have a theoretical read rate of ~10GB/sec sequential,
6GB/sec random and 1.2 million IOPs. If you can't do math or love the past,
you love spinning rust. If you are awesome you love SSDs.SSDs are cheaper than
drives using the most relevant metric: $/GB/IOPS. 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS and one
hard drive is 180 IOPS. Need 1 SSD instead of 50 hard drives.With 8 million
files there's a 9 minute fsck. Full backup in 12 minutes (X-25M based).4

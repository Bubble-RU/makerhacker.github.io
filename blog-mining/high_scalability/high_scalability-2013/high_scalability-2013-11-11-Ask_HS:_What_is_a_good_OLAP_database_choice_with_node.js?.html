<p>Introduction: This question was asked over email and I thought a larger audience might want
to take a whack at it.I have a problem I'd like to have your view on. I've
looked around a lot, and I haven't found a definite answer. The question is
this:Is it true that for a scalable web-based system targeting millions of
users (hopefully), using Microsoft technology(.Net/SQL Server) over open
source technologies like python/ruby/php and mysql (mariadb) / postgresql will
cost you more? Is there any justification for paying up for Microsoft
licenses(OS, SQL Server, â&euro;Ś)?I am in charge of selecting the technology toolbox
for a startup which is going to build a scalable public web platform. I've
worked as a developer and database developer/admin (mainly as a DBA) using
different platforms and technologies, but my main focus is on Microsoft
technology. I've considered all other important factors for this decision, and
at the end, I always come back to the question of money. When I finish
developing the first st</p><p>3 0.11072756 <a title="1546-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-22-Architecting_Massively-Scalable_Near-Real-Time_Risk_Analysis_Solutions.html">1161 high scalability-2011-12-22-Architecting Massively-Scalable Near-Real-Time Risk Analysis Solutions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Constructing a scalablerisk analysis solution is a fascinating architectural
challenge. If you come from Financial Services you are sure to appreciate
that. But even architects from other domains are bound to find the challenges
fascinating, and the architectural patterns of my suggested solution highly
useful in other domains.Recently I held an interesting webinar around
architecting solutions for scalable and near-real-time risk analysis solutions
based on experience gathered with Financial Services customers. Seeing the
vast interest in the webinar, I would like to share the highlights with you
here.From an architectural point of view, risk analysis is a data-intensive
and a compute-intensive process, which also has an elaborate orchestration
logic. volumes in this domain are massive and ever-increasing, together with
an ever-increasing demand to reduce response time. These trends are aggravated
by global financial regulatory reforms set following the late-2000s financial
crisis, wh</p><p>4 0.084670246 <a title="1546-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-18-NoCAP.html">921 high scalability-2010-10-18-NoCAP</a></p>

<p>Introduction: InNoSQL: Past, Present, FutureEric Brewerhas a particularly fine section on
explaining the often hard to understand ideas ofBASE(Basically Available, Soft
State, Eventually Consistent),ACID(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation,
Durability),CAP(Consistency Availability, Partition Tolerance), in terms of a
pernicious long standing myth about the sanctity of consistency in
banking.Myth: Money is important, so banksmustuse transactions to keep money
safe and consistent, right?Reality: Banking transactions are inconsistent,
particularly for ATMs. ATMs are designed to have a normal case behaviour and a
partition mode behaviour. In partition mode Availability is chosen over
Consistency.Why?1)Availability correlates with revenue and consistency
generally does not.2)Historically there was never an idea of perfect
communication so everything was partitioned.Your ATM transaction must go
through so Availability is more important than consistency. If the ATM is down
then you aren't making money.

<p>Introduction: The world of NoSQL and alternative database implementations (i.e. non-
relational) is deeply fascinating to me. I can't help but be swept up in the
whirl of planet-scale web development scalability techniques and the evolution
of how developers think about building their applications knowing that with
success comes the inevitable need to scale to levels almost unimaginable just
five or ten years ago.I'm going to make a prediction: Developers will be
expected to understand the fundamentals of how different database systems can
be applied within a singular application; their strengths and weaknesses, and
when it is appropriate to leverage them.There's a lot out there about scaling
relational databases. Partitioning your data over application-managed shards
is a topic that has seen its fair share of attention. But I think there's a
whole slew over NoSQL databases that have been built and designed by some very
smart people that are new enough that their internals aren't well understood

<p>Introduction: Hi there,I have an idea for an online database that services a large number of
people. I've been studying it for a while and it seems feasible to me to
create it and get people to populate it. It will need time to grow but
eventually it will get there.The model I'm looking at is IMDB, the depth of
information is fascinating, yet it's fast, not so easy to use though, but it's
pretty usable!What do you think I need to create a database an online database
like IMDB. I know that IMDB power comes from it's information, not the design
of the site. This is something I kind of figured out.But what I need to know
is the best tools to publish database contents on the web, retrieve it in that
fast way like IMDB. I'm sure that I will need to create data entry logs for my
users to populate the database.What programming languages you suggest?
development environment? approaches?your contribution is highly
appreciated.Regards,Jalil</p><p>4 0.69754028 <a title="1546-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-18-Announcing_My_Webinar_on_December_14th%3A_What_Should_I_Do%3F_Choosing_SQL%2C_NoSQL_or_Both_for_Scalable_Web_Applications.html">945 high scalability-2010-11-18-Announcing My Webinar on December 14th: What Should I Do?

<p>Introduction: Private Clouds provide many of the benefits of the Public Cloud, namely
elastic scalability, faster time-to-market and reduced OpEX, all within the
Enterprises own perimeter that complies to its governance. Leading commercial
Private Cloud products include VMware, Univa UD, Unisys. Open source solutions
include pro ducts like Globus Nimbus, Enomaly Elastic Computing Platform,
RESERVOIR and Eucalyptus.Read more

<p>Introduction: This question was asked over email and I thought a larger audience might want
to take a whack at it.With a business associate, I am trying to develop a
financial software that handles financial reports of listed companies. We
managed to create this database with all the data necessary to do financial
analysis. My associate is a Business Intelligence specialist so he is keen to
use OLAPs databases like Microsoft Analysis Services or Jedox Palo, which
enables in-memory calculations and very fast aggregation, slicing and dicing
of data or write-backs.At the same time I did an online course (MOOC) from
Stanford CS184 called Startup Engineering which promoted/talked a lot about
javascript and especially node.js as the language of the future for servers.As
I am keen to use open-source technologies (would be keen to avoid MS SSAS) for
the development of a website to access this financial data , and there are so
many choices for databases out there (Postgre, MongoDB, MySQL etc..but don't

<p>Introduction: This strategy is from theLarge Hadron Colliderproject:Improvements in
performance per Watt have caused CERN to no longer sign hardware support
contracts longer than three years. Machines run until they die. They have a
very high utilization of equipment ('duty cycle', 7 x 24 x 365). Replacing
hardware makes more sense because of the lower cost and the power savings of
new hardware.</p><p>4 0.55243492 <a title="1546-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-02-Why_Pinterest_Uses_the_Cloud_Instead_of_Going_Solo_-_To_Be_Or_Not_To_Be.html">1380 high scalability-2013-01-02-Why Pinterest Uses the Cloud Instead of Going Solo - To Be Or Not To Be</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I love it when a somewhat older article like Pinterest Cut Costs From $54 To
$20 Per Hour By Automatically Shutting Down Systems hits Hacker News and
generates agood conversation. One of the common sentiments about the cloud was
raised: why doesn't Pinterest save a lot of money by running their own
hardware instead of using the cloud?Ryan Park, Operations Engineer at
Pinterest, responds in what I think is the perfectmodern responseto that
ultimate existential design dilemma:Our #1 requirement has been to keep up
with the growth in traffic on the site. We've been growing so fast that
there's literally no way we could have ordered and racked equipment fast
enough. We were also a very small team -- a year ago there were only about a
dozen people in the whole company. At this point we're much larger, which
gives us room to consider more options like colo or multiple cloud
providers.AWS certainly feels pretty costly when you compare colo prices to
the list price for on-demand instances.

<p>Introduction: There's a popular line of thought that says don't waste time on optimization
because developing features is more important than saving money. True, you can
always add resources, but at some point, especially in a more mature part of a
product lifecycle: performance equals $$$.Two great examples of this evolution
come from Facebook and Google. The upshot is that when you spend time and
money on optimizing your tool chain you can get huge wins in performance,
control, and costs. Certainly, don't bother if you are just starting, but at
some point you may want to switch to big development efforts in improving
efficiency.Facebook and HipHopThe Facebook example is quite well known:HipHop,
a static PHP compiler released in 2010, after two years of development. PHP
because Facebook implements their web tierin PHP. They've now developed a
dynamic compiler,HipHop VM, using techniques like JIT, side exits, HipHop
bytecode, type prediction, and parallel tracelet linking.This is an incredible

<p>Introduction: Update:   Streamy Explains CAP and HBase's Approach to CAP .  We plan to employ inter-cluster replication, with each cluster located in a single DC.  Remote replication will introduce some eventual consistency into the system, but each cluster will continue to be strongly consistent.   Ryan Barrett, Google App Engine datastore lead, gave this talk   Transactions Across Datacenters (and Other Weekend Projects)   at the Google I/O 2009 conference.   While the talk doesn't necessarily break new technical ground, Ryan does an excellent job explaining and evaluating the different options you have when architecting a system to work across multiple datacenters. This is called  multihoming ,  operating from multiple datacenters simultaneously.  As multihoming is one of the most challenging tasks in all computing, Ryan's clear and thoughtful style comfortably leads you through the various options. On the trip you learn:

<p>Introduction: Georeplication is one of the standard techniques for dealing when bad things--failure and latency--happen to good systems. The problem is always: how do you do that?  Murat Demirbas , Associate Professor at SUNY Buffalo, has a couple of really good posts that can help:  MDCC: Multi-Data Center Consistency  and  Making Geo-Replicated Systems Fast as Possible, Consistent when Necessary . 
 
In  MDCC: Multi-Data Center Consistency  Murat discusses a paper that says synchronous wide-area replication can be feasible. There's a quick and clear explanation of Paxos and various optimizations that is worth the price of admission. We find that strong consistency doesn't have to be lost across a WAN:
  

The good thing about using Paxos over the WAN is you /almost/ get the full CAP  (all three properties: consistency, availability, and partition-freedom). As we discussed earlier (Paxos taught), Paxos is CP, that is, in the presence of a partition, Paxos keeps consistency over availability.

You'll learn about how Amazon organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the ACM Queue article have also been included.   Amazon grew from a tiny online bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden shared is version of Amazon's birth pangs in a series of blog articles

<p>Introduction: To scale in the large you have to partition. Data has to be spread around, replicated, and kept consistent (keeping replicas sufficiently similar to one another despite operations being submitted independently at different sites). The result is a highly available, well performing, and scalable system.   Partitioning is required, but it's a pain to do efficiently and correctly. Until  Quantum teleportation  becomes a reality how data is kept consistent across a bewildering number of failure scenarios is a key design decision.  This excellent paper by Yasushi Saito and Marc Shapiro takes us on a wild ride (OK, maybe not so wild) of different approaches to achieving consistency.   What's cool about this paper is they go over some real systems that we are familiar with and cover how they work: DNS (single-master, state-transfer), Usenet (multi-master), PDAs (multi-master, state-transfer, manual or application-specific conflict resolution), Bayou (multi-master, operation-transfer, epidemic</p><p>4 0.77653551 <a title="1544-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-23-Paper%3A_Don%E2%80%99t_Settle_for_Eventual%3A_Scalable_Causal_Consistency_for_Wide-Area_Storage_with_COPS.html">1146 high scalability-2011-11-23-Paper: Don’t Settle for Eventual: Scalable Causal Consistency for Wide-Area Storage with COPS</a></p>

<p>Introduction: For a great Christmas read forget  The Night Before Christmas , a heart warming poem written by Clement Moore for his children, that created the modern idea of Santa Clause we all know and anticipate each Christmas eve. Instead, curl up with a some potentÂ  eggnog , nog being any drink made with rum, and readÂ  CRDTs: Consistency without concurrency control Â by Mihai Letia, Nuno PreguiĂ§a, and Marc Shapiro, which talks about CRDTs (Commutative Replicated Data Type),  a data type whose operations commute when they are concurrent .
 
From the introduction, which also serves as a nice concise overview of distributed consistency issues:
  

Shared read-only data is easy to scale by using well-understood replication techniques. However, sharing mutable data at a large scale is a difficult problem, because of the CAP impossibility result [5]. Two approaches dominate in practice. One ensures scalability by giving up consistency guarantees, for instance using the Last-Writer-Wins (LWW) approach [</p><p>6 0.76528865 <a title="1544-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-11-Google_Megastore_-_3_Billion_Writes_and_20_Billion_Read_Transactions_Daily.html">972 high scalability-2011-01-11-Google Megastore - 3 Billion Writes and 20 Billion Read Transactions Daily</a></p>

<p>Introduction: An interesting and different implementation approach:  Tempest: Scalable Time-Critical Web Services Platform : 
  

Tempest is a new framework for developing time-critical web services. Tempest enables developers to build scalable, fault-tolerant services that can then be automatically replicated and deployed across clusters of computing nodes. The platform automatically adapts to load ﬂuctuations, reacts when components fail, and ensures consistency between replicas by repairing when inconsistencies do occur. Tempest relies on a family of epidemic protocols and on Ricochet, a reliable time critical multicast protocol with probabilistic guarantees.


Tempest is built around a novel storage abstraction called the TempestCollection in which application developers store the state of a service. Our platform handles the replication of this state across clones of the service, persistence, and failure handling. To minimize the need for specialized knowledge on the part of the application deve</p><p>4 0.8131119 <a title="1544-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-24-4_New_Podcasts_for_Scalable_Summertime_Reading.html">864 high scalability-2010-07-24-4 New Podcasts for Scalable Summertime Reading</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's trendy today to say "I don't read blogs anymore, I just  let the  random chance of my social network guide me to new and interesting  content." #fail. While someone says this I imagine them flicking their  hair back in a "I can't be bothered with true understanding" disdain. And  where does random chance get its content? From people like these. So:  support your local blog! 
 
If you would like to be a part of random chance, here are a few new podcasts/blogs/vidcasts that you may not know about and that I've found interesting:

<p>Introduction: The Peregrine falcon is a bird of prey, famous for its  high speed diving   attacks , feeding primarily on much slower Hadoops. Wait, sorry, it is Kevin Burton of Spinn3r's new  Peregrine project -- a  new FAST modern map reduce framework optimized for iterative and pipelined map reduce jobs -- that feeds on Hadoops.
 
If you don't know Kevin, he does a lot of excellent technical work that he's kind enough to share it on  his blog . Only he hasn't been blogging much lately, he's been heads down working on Peregrine. Now that Peregrine has been released, here's a short email interview with Kevin on why you might want to take up  falconry , the ancient sport of MapReduce.
  What does Spinn3r do that Peregrine is important to you?  
Ideally it was designed to execute pagerank but many iterative applications that we deploy and WANT to deploy (k-means) would be horribly inefficient under Hadoop as it doesn't have any support for merging and joining IO between tasks.  It also doesn't support</p><p>6 0.77628428 <a title="1544-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-15-Lustre_cluster_file_system.html">13 high scalability-2007-07-15-Lustre cluster file system</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There has been an update on Pinterest: Pinterest growth driven by Amazon cloud
scalability since our last post: A Short on the Pinterest Stack for Handling
3+ Million Users.With Pinterest we see a story very similar to that
ofInstagram. Huge growth, lots of users, lots of data, with remarkably few
employees, all on the cloud.While it's true that both Pinterest and Instagram
are not making great advances inscience and technology, that is more indicator
of the easy power of today's commodity environments rather than a sign of
Silicon Valley's lack of innovation. The numbers are so huge and the
valuations are so high we naturally want some sort of fundamental
technological revolution to underlie their growth. The revolution is more
subtle. It really is just that easy to attain such growth these days, if you
can execute on the right idea. Get used to it. This is the new normal.Here's
what Pinterest looks like today: 80 million objects stored in S3 with 410

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ali Khajeh-Hosseini, Technical Lead at
PlanForCloud.com.  I read a recent blog post about TripAdvisor's experiment
with AWS where they attempted to process 700K HTTP requests per minute on a
replica of their live site. There was also an interesting blog post on
Pinterest's massive growth on AWS. These blogs highlighted exactly the types
of questions we're interested in, mainly:How much would it cost to deploy
System X on Cloud Y? e.g. how much would it cost to host TripAdvisor on the
AWS US-East cloud?Would it be cheaper to use deployment option X or Y? e.g.
would it be cheaper to use reserved instances, different types of instances,
different cloud providers...What happens to costs when the system grows? e.g.
Pinterest has around 410TB of data on S3, what if that keeps growing at a rate
of 25% every month, like it has been in the last 10 months?I created a couple

<p>Introduction: We've long known one of the virtues of the cloud is, through the magic of
services and automation, that systems can be shut or tuned down when not in
use. What may be surprising is how much money can be saved. This aspect of
cloudiness got a lot of pub atAWS re:Invent and is being rebranded under the
term Cost-Aware Architecture. Aninteresting examplewas given by Ryan Park,
Pinterest's technical operations lead:20% of their systems are shutdown after
hours in response to traffic loadsReserved instances are used for standard
traffic On-demand and spot instances are used to handle the elastic load
throughout the day. When more servers are needed for an auto-scaled service,
spot requests are opened and on-demand instances are started at the same time.
Most services are targeted to run at about 50% on-demand and 50% spot.Watchdog
processes continually check what's running. More instances are launched when
needed and terminated when not needed. If spot prices spike and spot instances

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byAli Khajeh-Hosseini, Technical Lead atPlanForCloud. The
original article was publishedon their site. With 29 cloud price reductions I
thought it would be interesting to see how the bottom line would change
compared to an articlewe published last year. The result is surprisingly
little for TripAdvisor because prices for On Demand instances havenot dropped
as fastas for other other instances types.Over the last year and a half,we
counted 29 price reductionsin cloud services provided by AWS, Google Compute
Engine, Windows Azure, and Rackspace Cloud. Price reductions have a direct
effect on cloud users, but given the usual tiny reductions, how significant is
that effect on the bottom line?Last year I wrote aboutcloud cost forecasts for

<p>Introduction: When EC2 first started the mental model was of a magic Pez dispenser supplying
an infinite stream of instances in any desired flavor. If you needed an
instance, because of a either a failure or traffic spike, it would be there.
As amazing as EC2 is, this model turned out to be optimistic.  From athread on
the Amazon discussion forum we learn any dispenser has limits:As Availability
Zones grow over time, our ability to continue to expand them can become
constrained. In these scenarios, we will prevent customers from launching in
the constrained zone if they do not yet have existing resources in that zone.
We also might remove the constrained zone entirely from the list of options
for new customers. This means that occasionally, different customers will see
a different number of Availability Zones in a particular Region. Both
approaches aim to help customers avoid accidentally starting to build up their
infrastructure in an Availability Zone where they might have less ability to
expand.T</p><p>6 0.7747798 <a title="1380-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-09-20-How_Vimeo_Saves_50%25_on_EC2_by_Playing_a_Smarter_Game.html">1326 high scalability-2012-09-20-How Vimeo Saves 50% on EC2 by Playing a Smarter Game</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:Final Thoughts on SSD and MySQL AKA Battleship Spinn3r. Tips on how to
make your database 10x faster using solid state drives. Potential exists for
100x speedup.Solid-state drives(SSDs) are the holy grail of storage. The
promise of RAM speeds and hard disk like persistence have for years driven us
crazy with power user lust, but they've stayed tantalizingly just out of
reach. Always too expensive, too small, and oddly too slow. Has that changed?
Can you now miraculously have your cake and eat it too? Can you now have it
both ways? Is balancing work with family life now as easy as tripping over a
terabyte drive?In a pioneering series of blog articles Kevin Burton conducts
original research on next generation SSD drives in real world configurations.

<p>Introduction: I love it when a somewhat older article like Pinterest Cut Costs From $54 To
$20 Per Hour By Automatically Shutting Down Systems hits Hacker News and
generates agood conversation. One of the common sentiments about the cloud was
raised: why doesn't Pinterest save a lot of money by running their own
hardware instead of using the cloud?Ryan Park, Operations Engineer at
Pinterest, responds in what I think is the perfectmodern responseto that
ultimate existential design dilemma:Our #1 requirement has been to keep up
with the growth in traffic on the site. We've been growing so fast that
there's literally no way we could have ordered and racked equipment fast
enough. We were also a very small team -- a year ago there were only about a
dozen people in the whole company. At this point we're much larger, which
gives us room to consider more options like colo or multiple cloud
providers.AWS certainly feels pretty costly when you compare colo prices to
the list price for on-demand instances.

<p>Introduction: Toy solutions solving Twitter's "problems" are a favorite scalability trope.
Everybody has this idea that Twitter is easy. With a little architectural hand
waving we have a scalable Twitter, just that simple. Well, it's not that
simple asRaffi Krikorian, VP of Engineering at Twitter, describes in his
superb and very detailed presentation onTimelines at Scale. If you want to
know how Twitter works - then start here.It happened gradually so you may have
missed it, but Twitter has grown up. It started as a strugglingthree-tierish
Ruby on Railswebsite to become a beautifully service driven core that we
actually go to now to see if other services are down. Quite a change.Twitter
now has 150M world wide active users, handles 300K QPS to generate timelines,
and a firehose that churns out 22 MB/sec. 400 million tweets a day flow
through the system and it can take up to 5 minutes for a tweet to flow from
Lady Gaga's fingers to her 31 million followers.A couple of points stood

runsTripAdvisor's Technical Operations team, Luke and Victor interned on his
team this past summer. This post is introduced byAndy Gelfond, TripAdvisor's
head of engineering.It's been a little over a year since our last post about
theTripAdvisor architecture. It has been an exciting year. Our business and
team continues to grow, we are now an independent public company, and we have
continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown -
we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work
across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:56M visitors per
month350M+ pages requests a day120TB+ of warehouse data running on a large
Hadoop cluster, and quickly growingWe also had a very successful college

Jonathan Marks: It's actually a talk about how NOT to be creative. And what he
[John Cleese] describes is the way most international broadcasters operated
for most of their existence. They were content factories, slave to an
artificial transmission schedule. Because they didn't take time to be
creative, then ended up sounding like a tape machine. They were run by a
computer algorithm. Not a human soul. There was never room for a creative
pause. Routine was the solution. And that's creativities biggest enemy.40%

found and the fix was using the right gcc flags. But the big hairy key idea

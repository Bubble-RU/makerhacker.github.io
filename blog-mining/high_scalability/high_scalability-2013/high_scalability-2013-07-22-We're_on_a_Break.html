<p>Introduction: Twitter Sees Its 20 Billionth Tweet writes  Marshall Kirkpatrick of
ReadWriteWeb.Startups die for not having customers, so STOP thinking about how
to scale. Alessandro Orsi saysfocusing on the architecture and scaling
possibilities of your app for millions of users is just plain
dumb...concentrate on marketing...concentrate on user experience. Alessandro
is perfectly correct, but this isn't the year the 2000 when the default
architecture that is easy is also not scalable and when sites were built from
scratch one painful user at a time.  Today neither is tue. In the era of
social networks, where Facebook has 500 million users, successful applications
can and often do spike to millions of users seemingly overnight. And you have
to have some architecture. With today's tool-chains you don't have to choose
easy and non-scalable. There are other options. Of course, it's all pointless
without customers and that is what you need to worry about, but it's a false
choice in this era to think tha</p><p>3 0.49075541 <a title="1495-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-06-Email_Architecture.html">202 high scalability-2008-01-06-Email Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A lot has been said already about Twitter's scalability issues. Many have
given Twitter as an anti-pattern of how not to deal with scalability and have
suggested different solutions for scaling it. As Twitter is famously a Ruby-
on-Rails deployment, this case has also been used as a weapon in the
language/platform wars between the RoR and Java camps, and to a lesser degree,
also with the LAMP (PHP) camp</p><p>5 0.47751233 <a title="1495-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-29-Is_Eucalyptus_ready_to_be_your_private_cloud%3F.html">610 high scalability-2009-05-29-Is Eucalyptus ready to be your private cloud?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.
 
Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to sol</p><p>5 0.154891 <a title="1567-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-18-Amazon_Architecture.html">96 high scalability-2007-09-18-Amazon Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the ACM Queue article have also been included.   Amazon grew from a tiny online bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden shared is version of Amazon's birth pangs in a series of blog articles

  @thoward3 : OH: "We make scalability a possibility.. You know, we make 'scalapossibilty'. " 
  Tesla : When wireless is perfectly applied the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain, which in fact it is, all things being particles of a real and rhythmic whole. We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance. Not only this, but through television and telephony we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of miles; and the instruments through which we shall be able to do this will be amazingly simple compared with our present telephone. A man will be able to carry one in his vest pocket.

 Quotable quotes:            
 
  Markus Frind :   Scaling is not very fun these days.  
  Mike Krieger : Scaling is like replacing all components on a car while driving it at 100 mph.  
  @jaykreps : We built servers that could handle 100k connections by building servers that could handle 10k connections and waiting a decade. 
  @RichExperiences : Twitter alone generates more than 7 terabytes of data every day, Facebook 10 TB...

<p>Introduction: Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud .  The only independent platform most of us will have access to capable of hosting planet-scale applications is the Ambient Cloud. It forms a sort of digital potluck where everyone contributes memory, network, and other compute resources from whatever they happen to have available.   
  Top 10 Internet Startup Scalability Killers . Strategies taken from  The Art of Scalability .  1. Thinking Scalability Is Just About Technology; 2. Overuse of Synchronous Calls; 3. Failure to Weed or Seed Soon Enough; 4. Inappropriate Use of Databases; 5. Cesspools Instead of Swim Lanes; 6. Reliance on Vertical Scale; 7. Failure to Learn from History; 8. Changing Development Methodologies to Fix Problems; 9. Too Little Caching, Too Late; 10. Overreliance on Third Parties to Scale.

 Can MySQL really handle 1,000,000 req/sec? Sure, when you turn it into a NoSQLish database, skip all the SQL processing, and access the backend store directly. Percona is making this possible with their H andlerSocket plugin  based on the work of  Yoshinori Matsunobu .

Eight years is a difficult prediction horizon. It's too short to simply project out current trends and it's too long to discount potential technological breakthroughs coming to market. There's the challenge.
 
Some of my lousy predictions: 
  
  Programmers Will Form Guilds Around New Gamified Training Hubs  
  The Web Will Become More Closed Before it Becomes More Open  
  Not Everyone Will Become a Programmer  
  Focus Will Shift to Creating Bigger People Instead of Chasing Big Ideas

<p>Introduction: Update:   Anatomy of a crash in a new part of Yandex written in Django . Writing to a magic session variable caused an unexpected write into an InnoDB database on every request. Writes took 6-7 seconds because of index rebuilding. Lots of useful details on the sizing of their system, what went wrong, and how they fixed it.   Yandex is a Russian search engine with 3.5 billion pages in their search index. We only know a few fun facts about how they do things, nothing at a detailed architecture level. Hopefully we'll learn more later, but I thought it would still be interesting. From Allen Stern's interview with Yandex's CTO Ilya Segalovich, we learn:
   3.5 billion pages in the search index.    Over several thousand servers.    35 million searches a day.    Several data centers around Russia.    Two-layer architecture.    The database is split in pieces and when a search is requested, it pulls the bits from the different database servers and brings it together for the user.

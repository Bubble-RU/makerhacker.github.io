<p>Introduction: My favorite kind of histories are those told from an insider's perspective.
The story of Richard the Lionheart is full of great battles and dynastic
intrigue. The story of one of his soldiers, not so much. Yet the soldiers'
story, as someone who has experienced the real consequences of decisions made
and actions taken, is more revealing.We get such a history in Chat Wars, a
wonderful article written by David Auerbach, who in 1998 worked at Microsoft
on MSN Messenger Service, Microsoft's instant messaging app (for a related
story see The Rise and Fall of AIM, the Breakthrough AOL Never Wanted).It's as
if Herodotus visited Microsoft and wrote down his experiences. It has that
same sort of conversational tone, insightful on-the-ground observations, and
facts no outsider might ever believe.Much of the article is a play-by-play
account of the cat and mouse game David plays changing Messenger to track
AOL's Instant Messenger protocol changes. AOL repeatedly tried to make it so

<p>Introduction: This question was asked over email and I thought a larger audience might want
to take a whack at it.With a business associate, I am trying to develop a
financial software that handles financial reports of listed companies. We
managed to create this database with all the data necessary to do financial
analysis. My associate is a Business Intelligence specialist so he is keen to
use OLAPs databases like Microsoft Analysis Services or Jedox Palo, which
enables in-memory calculations and very fast aggregation, slicing and dicing
of data or write-backs.At the same time I did an online course (MOOC) from
Stanford CS184 called Startup Engineering which promoted/talked a lot about
javascript and especially node.js as the language of the future for servers.As
I am keen to use open-source technologies (would be keen to avoid MS SSAS) for
the development of a website to access this financial data , and there are so
many choices for databases out there (Postgre, MongoDB, MySQL etc..but don't

<p>Introduction: Microsoft SQL Server 2008 incorporates the tools and technologies that are
necessary to implement relational databases, reporting systems, and data
warehouses of enterprise scale, and provides optimal performance and
responsiveness.With SQL Server 2008, you can take advantage of the latest
hardware technologies while scaling up your servers to support server
consolidation. SQL Server 2008 also enables you to scale out your largest data
solutions.This white paper describes the performance and scalability
capabilities of Microsoft速 SQL Server速 2008 and explains how you can use these
capabilities to:* Optimize performance for any size of database with the tools
and features that are available for the database engine, analysis services,
reporting services, and integration services.* Scale up your servers to take
full advantage of new hardware capabilities.* Scale out your database
environment to optimize responsiveness and to move your data closer to your
users.Read the entire article abou</p><p>6 0.12740901 <a title="1528-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-26-Reddit%3A_Lessons_Learned_from_Mistakes_Made_Scaling_to_1_Billion_Pageviews_a_Month.html">1507 high scalability-2013-08-26-Reddit: Lessons Learned from Mistakes Made Scaling to 1 Billion Pageviews a Month</a></p>

site was created by top programmer and blog starsJeff AtwoodandJoel Spolsky.
In that sense Stack Overflow is like a celebrity owned restaurant, only it
should be around for a while. Joel estimates 1/3 of all the programmers in the
world have used the site so they must be serving up something good.I fell in

<p>Introduction: It's time to do something a little different and for me that doesn't mean
cutting off my hair and joining a monastery, nor does it mean buying a cherry
red convertible (yet), it means doing a webinar!On December 14th, 2:00 PM -
3:00 PM EST, I'll be hosting What Should I Do? Choosing SQL, NoSQL or Both for
Scalable Web Applications.The webinar is sponsored by VoltDB, but it will be
completely vendor independent, as that's the only honor preserving and
technically accurate way of doing these things.The webinar will run about 60
minutes, with 40 minutes of speechifying and 20 minutes for questions.The
hashtag for the event on Twitter will beSQLNoSQL. I'll be monitoring that
hashtag if you have any suggestions for the webinar or if you would like to
ask questions during the webinar. The motivation for me to do the webinar was
a talk I had with another audience member at theNoSQL Evening in Palo Alto. He
said he came from a Java background and was confused about the future. His

<p>Introduction: Flickr's lone database guy Dathan Pattishall made his excellent presentation
available on how on how Flickr scales its backend to handle tremendous loads.
Some of this information is available inFlickr Architecture, but the paper is
so good it's worth another read. If you want to see sharding done right, at
scale, take a look.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.89418179 <a title="1528-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-07-Ask_HS%3A_Is_Microsoft_the_Right_Technology_for_a_Scalable_Web-based_System%3F.html">1528 high scalability-2013-10-07-Ask HS: Is Microsoft the Right Technology for a Scalable Web-based System?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This question was asked over email and I thought a larger audience might want
to take a whack at it.I have a problem I'd like to have your view on. I've
looked around a lot, and I haven't found a definite answer. The question is
this:Is it true that for a scalable web-based system targeting millions of
users (hopefully), using Microsoft technology(.Net/SQL Server) over open
source technologies like python/ruby/php and mysql (mariadb) / postgresql will
cost you more? Is there any justification for paying up for Microsoft
licenses(OS, SQL Server, â&euro;Ś)?I am in charge of selecting the technology toolbox
for a startup which is going to build a scalable public web platform. I've
worked as a developer and database developer/admin (mainly as a DBA) using
different platforms and technologies, but my main focus is on Microsoft
technology. I've considered all other important factors for this decision, and
at the end, I always come back to the question of money. When I finish
developing the first st</p><p>3 0.87183827 <a title="1528-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-18-Database_Design_101.html">281 high scalability-2008-03-18-Database Design 101</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I am working on the design for my database and can't seem to come up with a
firm schema. I am torn between normalizing the data and dealing with the
overhead of joins and denormalizing it for easy sharding. The data is
essentially music information per user: UserID, Artist, Album, Song. This
lends itself nicely to be normalized and have separate User, Artist, Album and
Song databases with a table full of INTs to tie them together. This will be in
a mostly read based environment and with about 80% being searches of data by
artist album or song. By the time I begin the query for artist, album or song
I will already have a list of UserID's to limit the search by. The problem is
that the tables can get unmanageably large pretty quickly and my plan was to
shard off users once it got too big. Given this simple data relationship what
are the pros and cons of normalizing the data vs denormalizing it? Should I go
with 4 separate, normalized tables or one 4 column table? Perhaps it might be
best</p><p>4 0.86636919 <a title="1528-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-30-Basho_Lives_up_to_their_Name_With_Consistent_Smashing.html">868 high scalability-2010-07-30-Basho Lives up to their Name With Consistent Smashing</a></p>

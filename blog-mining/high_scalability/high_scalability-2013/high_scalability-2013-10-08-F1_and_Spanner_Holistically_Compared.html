<p>Introduction: A lot of people seem to passionately dislike the term   NewSQL   , or pretty much any newly coined term for that matter, but after watching Alex Lloyd, Senior Staff Software Engineer Google, give a great talk    on Building Spanner   , that’s the term that fits Spanner best.  
 
 Spanner wraps the SQL + transaction model of OldSQL around the reworked bones of a globally distributed NoSQL system. That seems NewSQL to me.    As Spanner is a not so distant cousin of BigTable, the NoSQL component should be no surprise. Spanner is charged with spanning millions of machines inside any number of geographically distributed datacenters. What is surprising is how OldSQL has been embraced. In an    earlier 2011 talk    given by Alex at the HotStorage conference, the reason for embracing OldSQL was the desire to make it easier and faster for programmers to build applications. The main ideas will seem quite familiar:

<p>Introduction: Google recently released a   paper on Spanner   , their planet enveloping tool for organizing the world’s monetizable information. Reading the Spanner paper I felt it had that chiseled in stone feel that all of Google’s best papers have. An instant classic. Jeff Dean foreshadowed Spanner’s humungousness as early as    2009   .  Now Spanner seems fully online, just waiting to handle “millions of machines across hundreds of datacenters and trillions of database rows.” Wow.    The Wise have yet to weigh in on Spanner en masse. I look forward to more insightful commentary. There’s a lot to make sense of. What struck me most in the paper was a deeply buried section essentially describing Google’s motivation for shifting away from NoSQL and to    NewSQL   . The money quote: 
  
   We believe it is better to have application programmers deal with performance problems due to overuse of transactions as bottlenecks arise, rather than always coding around the lack of transactions.

<p>Introduction: Some of us are not aware of the tremendous job databases perform, particularly their efforts to maintain the Isolation aspect of ACID. For example, some people believe that transactions are only related to data manipulation and not to queries, which is an incorrect assumption. Transaction Isolation is all about queries, and the consistency and completeness of the data retrieved by queries. This is how it works:
 
Isolation gives the querying user the feeling that he owns the database. It does not matter that hundreds or thousands of concurrent users work with the same database and the same schema (or even the same data). These other uses can generate new data, modify existing data or perform any other action. The querying user must be able to get a complete, consistent picture of the data, unaffected by other users’ actions.
 
Let’s take the following scenario, which is based on an Orders table that has 1,000,000 rows, with a disk size of 20 GB:

<p>Introduction: Update 2:   Sorting 1 PB with MapReduce . PB is not peanut-butter-and-jelly misspelled. It's 1 petabyte or 1000 terabytes or 1,000,000 gigabytes.  It took six hours and two minutes to sort 1PB (10 trillion 100-byte records) on 4,000 computers  and the results were replicated thrice on 48,000 disks.  Update:   Greg Linden  points to a new Google article  MapReduce: simplified data processing on large clusters . Some interesting stats: 100k MapReduce jobs are executed each day; more than 20 petabytes of data are processed per day; more than 10k MapReduce programs have been implemented; machines are dual processor with gigabit ethernet and 4-8 GB of memory.  Google is the King of scalability.  Everyone knows Google for their large,  sophisticated, and fast searching, but they don't just shine in search.

<p>Introduction: This is an interview with   MemSQL    cofounder’s    Eric Frenkiel    and    Nikita Shamgunov   , in which they try to answer critics by going into more depth about their technology.     MemSQL ruffled a few feathers with their claim of being the fastest database in the world. According to their benchmarks MemSQL can execute 200K TPS on an EC2   Quadruple   Extra Large   and on a 64 core machine they can push 1.2 million transactions a second.     Benchmarks are always a dark mirror, so make of them what you will, but the target market for MemSQL is clear: projects looking for something both fast and familiar. Fast as in a novel design using a combination of technologies like    MVCC   , code generation,    lock-free data structures   ,    skip lists   , and    in-memory execution   . Familiar as in SQL and nothing but SQL. The only interface to MemSQL is SQL.    It’s right to point out MemSQL gets a boost by being a first release. Only a limited subset of SQL is supported, neither rep</p><p>5 0.75885081 <a title="1529-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-08-Yahoo%21%27s_PNUTS_Database%3A_Too_Hot%2C_Too_Cold_or_Just_Right%3F.html">676 high scalability-2009-08-08-Yahoo!'s PNUTS Database: Too Hot, Too Cold or Just Right?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: So far every massively scalable database is a bundle of compromises. For some the weak guarantees of Amazon's  eventual consistency  model are too cold. For many the strong guarantees of standard RDBMS  distributed transactions  are too hot. Google App Engine tries to get it just right with  entity groups . Yahoo! is also trying to get is just right by offering per-record timeline consistency, which hopes to serve up a heaping bowl of  rich database functionality and low latency at massive scale :
   We describe PNUTS [Platform for Nimble Universal Table Storage], a massively parallel and geographically distributed database system for Yahoo!â&euro;&trade;s web applications. PNUTS provides data storage organized as hashed or ordered tables, low latency for large numbers of con-current requests including updates and queries, and novel per-record consistency guarantees. It is a hosted, centrally managed, and geographically distributed service, and utilizes automated load-balancing and failover to redu</p><p>6 0.75522959 <a title="1529-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-05-Product%3A_Tungsten_Replicator.html">380 high scalability-2008-09-05-Product: Tungsten Replicator</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Summary    In this presentation, a three steps approach for turning your existing stateful tier-based/Spring-application into a dynamically scalable services application using OpenSpaces is demonstrated. The existing programming model is kept the same while focusing on abstracting and replacing the underlying implementations of the middleware stack in a way that will fit the scale-out model.

<p>Introduction: Varnish  is a state-of-the-art, high-performance HTTP accelerator. Varnish is targeted primarily at the FreeBSD 6 and Linux 2.6 platforms, and will take full advantage of the virtual memory system and advanced I/O features offered by these operating systems.  Varnish was written from the ground up to be a high performance caching reverse proxy. Squid is a forward proxy that can be configured as a reverse proxy. Besides - Squid is rather old and designed like computer programs where supposed to be designed in 1980.  Varnish is reported to be 10x-20x faster than Squid on the same hardware.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.8984738 <a title="1529-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-08-F1_and_Spanner_Holistically_Compared.html">1529 high scalability-2013-10-08-F1 and Spanner Holistically Compared</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This aricle,  F1: A Distributed SQL Database That Scales  by  Srihari Srinivasan , is republished with permission from a blog you really should follow:  Systems We Make  - Curating Complex Distributed Systems. 
 
With both the F1 and  Spanner  papers out its now possible to understand their interplay a bit holistically. So lets start by revisiting the key goals of both systems.
   Key Goals of F1′s design    
 
 System must be able to scale up by adding resources 
 Ability to re-shard and rebalance data without application changes 
 ACID consistency for transactions 
 Full SQL support, support for indexes 
 
       Spanner’s objectives    
 
 Main focus is on managing cross data center replicated data 
 Ability to re-shard and rebalance data 
 Automatically migrates data across machines 
 
  F1 – An overview  
 
 
 F1 is built on top of Spanner. Spanner offers support for for features such as – strong consistency through distributed transactions (2PC), global ordering based on timestam</p><p>5 0.89733964 <a title="1529-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-09-No_to_SQL%3F_Anti-database_movement_gains_steam_%E2%80%93_My_Take.html">654 high scalability-2009-07-09-No to SQL?

<p>Introduction: In  this post  i wrote my view on the anti SQL database movement and where the alternative approach fits in:  - SQL databases are not going away anytime soon.  - The current "one size fit it all" databases thinking was and is wrong.  - There is definitely a place for a more a more specialized data management solutions alongside traditional SQL databases.  In addition to the options that was mentioned on the original article i pointed out the the in-memory alternative approach and how that fits into the puzzle. I used a real life scenario:   scalable Social network based eCommerce site where i outlined how in-memory approach was the only option they could scale and meet their application performance and response time requirements.</p><p>6 0.88572425 <a title="1529-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-27-Comet_-_An_Example_of_the_New_Key-Code_Databases.html">979 high scalability-2011-01-27-Comet - An Example of the New Key-Code Databases</a></p>

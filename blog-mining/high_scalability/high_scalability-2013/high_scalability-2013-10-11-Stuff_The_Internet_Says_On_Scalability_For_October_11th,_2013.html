</p><p>16 We use vertex degree analysis as a simple example problem, create a formal definition of vertex degree in a property graph, and develop a theoretical vertex degree cache with constant space and read time complexity, enabled by a cache compaction operation and a property change frequency heuristic. [sent-91, score-0.996]
</p><p>17 In this work, we consider the problem of providing Highly Available Transactions (HATs): transactional guarantees that do not suffer unavailability during system partitions or incur high network latency. [sent-93, score-0.327]
</p><p>18 We introduce a taxonomy of highly available systems and analyze existing ACID isolation and distributed data consistency guarantees to identify which can and cannot be achieved in HAT systems. [sent-94, score-0.362]
</p><p>19 This unifies the literature on weak transactional isolation, replica consistency, and highly available systems. [sent-95, score-0.152]

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve?

<p>Introduction: On the surface nothing appears more different than soft data and hard raw
materials like iron. Then isn't itironic, in theAlanis Morissettesense, that
in this Age of Information, great wealth still lies hidden deep beneath piles
of stuff? It's so strange how directly digging for dollars in data parallels
the great wealth producing models of the Industrial Revolution.The piles of
stuff is the Internet. It takes lots of prospecting to find the right stuff.
Mighty web crawling machines tirelessly collect stuff, bringing it into their
huge maws, then depositing load after load into rack after rack of distributed
file system machines. Then armies of still other machines take this stuff and
strip out the valuable raw materials, which in the Information Age, are
endless bytes of raw data. Link clicks, likes, page views, content, head
lines, searches, inbound links, outbound links, search clicks, hashtags,
friends, purchases: anything and everything you do on the Internet is a
valuable raw mat</p><p>4 0.16088131 <a title="1530-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-13-Neo4j_-_a_Graph_Database_that_Kicks_Buttox.html">628 high scalability-2009-06-13-Neo4j - a Graph Database that Kicks Buttox</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:Social networks in the database: using a graph database. A nice post on
representing, traversing, and performing other common social network
operations using a graph database.If you areDiggorLinkedInyou can build your
own speedy graph database to represent your complex social network
relationships. For those of more modest meansNeo4j, a graph database, is a
good alternative.A graph is a collection nodes (things) and edges
(relationships) that connect pairs of nodes. Slap properties (key-value pairs)
on nodes and relationships and you have a surprisingly powerful way to
represent most anything you can think of. In a graph database "relationships
are first-class citizens. They connect two nodes and both nodes and
relationships can hold an arbitrary amount of key-value pairs. So you can look
at a graph database as a key-value store, with full support for
relationships."A graph looks something like:For more lovely examples take a
look at theGraph Image Gallery.Here's agood summaryby</p><p>5 0.15600626 <a title="1530-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-25-Latency_is_Everywhere_and_it_Costs_You_Sales_-_How_to_Crush_it.html">661 high scalability-2009-07-25-Latency is Everywhere and it Costs You Sales - How to Crush it</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 8:The Cost of Latency by James Hamilton. James summarizing some latency
info from Steve Souder,Greg Linden, andMarissa Mayer. Speed [is] an
undervalued and under-discussed asset on the web.Update 7:How do you know when
you need more memcache servers?. Dathan Pattishall talks about using memcache
not to scale, but to reduce latency and reduce I/O spikes, and how to use
stats to know when more servers are needed.Update 6:Stock Traders Find Speed
Pays, in Milliseconds. Goldman Sachs is making record profits off a500
millisecondtrading advantage. Yes, latency matters. As an interesting aside,
Libet found 500 msecs is about the time it takes the brain to weave together
an experience of consciousness from all our sensor inputs.Update 5:Shopzilla's
Site Redo - You Get What You Measure. At theVelocityconference Phil Dixon,
from Shopzilla, presented data showing a 5 second speed up resulted in a 25%
increase in page views, a 10% increase in revenue, a 50% reduction in
hardware, and a 120</p><p>6 0.15595096 <a title="1530-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

that when you say you want to be "the Google of something"Clay Shirky: I think
one of the things that happened to the P2P market for infrastructure is that
users preference for predictable pricing vs resource-sensitive pricing is so
overwhelming that they will overpay to anyone who can promise flat prices. And
because the logic of centralization vs decentralization is so price sensitive,
I don't think there is any logical reason to assume a broadly stable class of
apps, separate from current pricing data for energy, cycles, and
storage.@chipchilders: Stop freaking making new projects just for the sake of

<p>Introduction: Professor Lance Fortnow, in his blog post Drowning in Data, says complexity
has taught him this lesson:When storage is expensive, it is cheaper to
recompute what you've already computed. And that's the world we now live in:
Storage is pretty cheap but data acquisition and computation are even
cheaper.Jouni, one of the commenters, thinks the opposite is true:storage is
cheap, but computation is expensive. When you are dealing with massive data,
the size of the data set is very often determined by the amount of computing
power available for a certain price.With such data, a linear-time algorithm
takes O(1) seconds to finish, while a quadratic-time algorithm requires O(n)
seconds. But as computing power increases exponentially over time, the
quadratic algorithm gets exponentially slower.For me it's not a matter of
which is true, both positions can be true, but what's interesting is to think
that storage and computation are in some cases fungible. Your architecture can
decide which tradeof</p><p>2 0.95031154 <a title="1530-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-13-10_Hot_Scalability_Links_for_January_13%2C_2010.html">760 high scalability-2010-01-13-10 Hot Scalability Links for January 13, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Another scalability strategy brought to you by Erik Osterman:Just thought I'd
drop a brief suggestion to anyone building a large mail system. Our solution
for scaling mail pickup was to develop a sharded architecture whereby accounts
are spread across a cluster of servers, each with imap/pop3 capability. Then
we use a cluster of reverse proxies (Perdition) speaking to the backend
imap/pop3 servers .The benefit of this approach is you can use simply use
round-robin or HA load balancing on the perdition servers that end users
connect to (e.g. admins can easily move accounts around on the backend storage
servers without affecting end users). Perdition manages routing users to the
appropriate backend servers and has MySQL support.What we also liked about
this approach was that it had no dependency on a distributed or networked file
system, so less chance of corruption or data consistency issues. When an
individual server reaches capacity, we just off load users to a less used
server. If an</p><p>5 0.93429804 <a title="1530-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-08-Yahoo%21%27s_PNUTS_Database%3A_Too_Hot%2C_Too_Cold_or_Just_Right%3F.html">676 high scalability-2009-08-08-Yahoo!'s PNUTS Database: Too Hot, Too Cold or Just Right?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: So far every massively scalable database is a bundle of compromises. For some
the weak guarantees of Amazon'seventual consistencymodel are too cold. For
many the strong guarantees of standard RDBMSdistributed transactionsare too

also trying to get is just right by offering per-record timeline consistency,
which hopes to serve up a heaping bowl ofrich database functionality and low
latency at massive scale:We describe PNUTS [Platform for Nimble Universal
Table Storage], a massively parallel and geographically distributed database
system for Yahoo!'s web applications. PNUTS provides data storage organized as
hashed or ordered tables, low latency for large numbers of con-current
requests including updates and queries, and novel per-record consistency
guarantees. It is a hosted, centrally managed, and geographically distributed

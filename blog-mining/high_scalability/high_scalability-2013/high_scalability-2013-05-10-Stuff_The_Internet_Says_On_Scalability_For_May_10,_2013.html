<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-
grid.It's 2003: Add a caching layer.It's 2004: Add scale-out and
partitioning.It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a
distributed file system.It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.It's 2008: Cloud
+ web scalable database.It'</p><p>4 0.10918349 <a title="1455-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-28-37signals_Architecture.html">663 high scalability-2009-07-28-37signals Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 7:Basecamp, now with more vroom. Basecamp application servers running
Ruby code were upgraded and virtualization was removed. The result:A 66 %
reduction in the response time while handling multiples of the traffic is
beyond what I expected. They still use virtualization (Linux KVM), just less
of it now.Update 6:Things We've Learned at 37Signals. Themes: less is more;
don't worry be happy.Update 5:Nuts & Bolts: HAproxy. Nice explanation (post,
screencast) by Mark Imbriaco of why HAProxy (load balancing proxy server) is
their favorite (fast, efficient, graceful configuration, queues requests when
Mongrels are busy) for spreading dynamic content between Apache web servers
and Mongrel application servers.Update 4:O'Rielly's Tim O'Brien
interviewsDavid Hansson, Rails creator and 37signals partner. Says BaseCamp
scales horizontally on the application and web tier. Scales up for the
database, using one "big ass" 128GB machine. Says:As technology moves on,

<p>Introduction: All in all this is still my favorite post and I still think it's an accurate
vision of a future. Not everyone agrees, but I guess we'll see..."But it is
not complicated. [There's] just a lot of it." \--Richard Feynmanon how the

<p>Introduction: Ever wonder what powers Google's world spirit sensing Zeitgeist service? No,
it's not a homunculus ofGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel sitting in each browser.
It's actually a stream processing (think streaming MapReduce on steroids)
system called MillWheel, described in this very well written paper: MillWheel:
Fault-Tolerant Stream Processing at Internet Scale. MillWheel isn't just used
for Zeitgeist at Google, it's also used for streaming joins for a variety of
Ads customers, generalized anomaly-detection service, and network switch and
cluster health monitoring.Abstract:MillWheel is a framework for building low-
latency data-processing applications that is widely used at Google. Users
specify a directed computation graph and application code for individual
nodes, and the system manages persistent state and the continuous ďŹ&sbquo;ow of
records, all within the envelope of the framework's fault-tolerance
guarantees. This paper describes MillWheel's programming model as well as its
implementation.</p><p>4 0.8474474 <a title="1455-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-19-Strategy%3A_Order_Two_Mediums_Instead_of_Two_Smalls_and_the_EC2_Buffet.html">812 high scalability-2010-04-19-Strategy: Order Two Mediums Instead of Two Smalls and the EC2 Buffet</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Vaibhav PuranikinWeb serving in the cloud - our experiences with nginx and
instance sizesdescribes their experience trying to maximum traffic and minimum
their web serving costs on EC2. Initially they tested with two m1.small
instance types and then they the switched to two c1.mediums instance types.
The m1s are the standard instance types and the c1s are the high CPU instance
types. Obviously the mediums have greater capability, but the cost difference
was interesting:In the long term they will save money using the larger
instances and not autoscaling. With the small instances, traffic bursts caused
autoscaling to kick in. New instances were started in response to load. The
instances woud be up for a short period of time and then spin down again. This
constant churn costs a lot of money. Selecting the larger instance sizes,
which are capable of handling the load without autoscaling, turn out to save
money even though they are more expensive. Starting new instances also takes a
few min</p><p>5 0.8392759 <a title="1455-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-03-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_3%2C_2012.html">1297 high scalability-2012-08-03-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 3, 2012</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's HighScalability Time:Quotable Quotes:Ross Tur: the tricks you learned to
make things big are not the same tricks you can apply to make things infinite.
@gclaramunt: Son, I'm getting old, but let me tell you a secret: programming
is hard, and high scalability and concurrent programming... frigging
hard!@Carnage4Life: At Apple the iOS team didn't see iPhone hardware or
hardware team see OS until it shipped@adrianco:  #ebspio caps iops but latency
variance is much lower than EBS@bernardgolden: RT @peakscale: A culture of
automation is 10x more important than deployment/test/monkey thing you'd like
to discuss < devops calling@JayCollier: 50 years ago, school standardization
was needed for scale. Now, scalability and flexibility (variability) can
coexist. #FOL2012@adrianco: Compared to vanilla EBS many times better for
random reads. Bandwidth limits both for sequential and
writes.#ebspio@SQLPerfTips: More hardware won't solve response time problems.
Proper indexing does.@adrianco: I di</p><p>6 0.83528292 <a title="1455-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-21-Machine_VM_%2B_Cloud_API_-_Rewriting_the_Cloud_from_Scratch.html">923 high scalability-2010-10-21-Machine VM + Cloud API - Rewriting the Cloud from Scratch</a></p>

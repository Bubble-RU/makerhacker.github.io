<p>Introduction: Colin Scott, a Berkeley researcher, updated Jeff Dean's famousNumbers Everyone
Should Knowwith hisLatency Numbers Every Programmer Should Knowinteractive
graphic. The interactive aspect is cool because it has a slider that let's you
see numbers back from as early as 1990 to the far far future of 2020. Colin
explained hismotivation for updating the numbers:The other day, a friend
mentioned a latency number to me, and I realized that it was an order of
magnitude smaller than what I had memorized from Jeff's talk. The problem, of
course, is that hardware performance increases exponentially! After some
digging, I actually found that the numbers Jeff quotes are over a decade
oldSince numbers without interpretation are simply data, take a look atGoogle

<p>Introduction: Here's a really good article in the Communications of the ACM on reducing
network packet processing overhead by redesigning the network stack:
Revisiting Network I/O APIs: The Netmap Framework by Luigi Rizzo. As commodity
networking performance increases operating systems need to keep up or all
those CPUs will go to waste. How do they make this happen? Abstract:Today
10-gigabit interfaces are used more and more in datacenters and servers. On
these links, packets flow as fast as one every 67.2 nanoseconds, yet modern
operating systems can take 10-20 times longer just to move one packet between
the wire and the application. We can do much better, not with more powerful
hardware but by revising architectural decisions made long ago regarding the
design of device drivers and network stacks.The netmap framework is a
promising step in this direction. Thanks to a careful design and the
engineering of a new packet I/O API, netmap eliminates much unnecessary
overhead and moves traffic up to 40</p><p>5 0.064137563 <a title="1560-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-13-Snabb_Switch_-_Skip_the_OS_and_Get_40_million_Requests_Per_Second_in_Lua.html">1595 high scalability-2014-02-13-Snabb Switch - Skip the OS and Get 40 million Requests Per Second in Lua</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Snabb Switch \- a toolkit for solving novel problems in networking. If you are
building a new packet-processing network appliance then you can use Snabb
Switch to get the job done more quickly.Here's a great impassioned overview
from erichocean:Or, you could just avoid the OS
altogether:https://github.com/SnabbCo/snabbswitchOur current engineering
target is 1 million writes/sec and > 10 million reads/sec on top of an
architecture similar to that, on a single box, to our fully transactional,
MVCC database (write do not block reads, and vice versa) that runs in the same
process (a la SQLite), which we've also merged with our application code and
our caching tier, so we're down to--literally--a single process for what would
have been at least three separate tiers in a traditional setup.The result is
that we had to move to measuring request latency in microseconds exclusively.
The architecture (without additional application-specific processing) supports
a wire-to-wire messaging speed of 2</p><p>6 0.06144657 <a title="1560-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-22-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_22%2C_2011.html">1028 high scalability-2011-04-22-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 22, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: My favorite kind of histories are those told from an insider's perspective.
The story of Richard the Lionheart is full of great battles and dynastic
intrigue. The story of one of his soldiers, not so much. Yet the soldiers'
story, as someone who has experienced the real consequences of decisions made
and actions taken, is more revealing.We get such a history in Chat Wars, a
wonderful article written by David Auerbach, who in 1998 worked at Microsoft
on MSN Messenger Service, Microsoft's instant messaging app (for a related
story see The Rise and Fall of AIM, the Breakthrough AOL Never Wanted).It's as
if Herodotus visited Microsoft and wrote down his experiences. It has that
same sort of conversational tone, insightful on-the-ground observations, and
facts no outsider might ever believe.Much of the article is a play-by-play
account of the cat and mouse game David plays changing Messenger to track
AOL's Instant Messenger protocol changes. AOL repeatedly tried to make it so

<p>Introduction: An Analysis of Linux Scalability to Many Cores, by a number of MIT
researchers, is a refreshingly practical paper on what it takes to scale Linux
and common applications like Exim, memcached, Apache, PostgreSQL, gmake,
Psearchy, and MapReduce to run on 48 core systems. A very timely paper given
moderately massive multicore systems are reportedly the near future of
computing.This paper must have taken a lot of work. They both tracked down
bottlenecks in a number of applications and the Linux kernel and they also
tried to fix them. Modestly speaking the authors said they made "modest"
changes to the kernel and applications, but there's nothing modest about what
they did. It's excellent work.After the next bit, which is the abstract, there
is a list of the problems they found and how they fixed them.The abstract:This
paper analyzes the scalability of seven system applications (Exim, memcached,
Apache, PostgreSQL, gmake, Psearchy, and MapReduce) running on Linux on a
48-core computer. Exce</p><p>4 0.50027448 <a title="1560-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-26-Scale_to_China.html">165 high scalability-2007-11-26-Scale to China</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hello all,does anyone have experience in scaling a european website to
china?The main problem in china is the internet connectivity to websites
outside china, that means latency and packetloss (and perhaps filtering) make
things difficult.The options I see are:1. Host you application in china, but
where? I haven't got a answer from any chinese ISP I contacted. On the other
hand I don't really want to host in china.2. Build your own CDN. Wikipedia
shows how it goes. Get a bunch of machines (but where? see point 1) put squid
on them, implement intelligent cache invalidation and you're set. But where
can I get machines in china? Where do I need them in china? There are soe big
isps with limited peering capability, so I'd need servers in every network.3.
Get professional CDN services. Akamai, ChinaCache, CDNetworks, etc etc.. They
all provide services in china. The problem is: they are all very expensive.4.
Amazon EC2/S3 ? Is it worth thinking about this way? I am not sure, because

<p>Introduction: Hi,We're looking for a highly scalable way of scanning documents being
uploaded and downloaded from our web application. I believe services like
gmail and hotmail are using bespoke solutions from companies like Trend, but
are there some quality "off the shelf" products out there that can easily be
scaled out and have a "loose" API (HTTP based) for application
integration?Once again, thanks for any input.</p><p>6 0.382976 <a title="1560-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-08-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_8%2C_2011.html">1076 high scalability-2011-07-08-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 8, 2011</a></p>

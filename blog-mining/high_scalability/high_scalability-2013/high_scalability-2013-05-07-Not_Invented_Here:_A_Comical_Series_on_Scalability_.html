<p>Introduction: Hi all, a     I run a site that after a complete redesign have gotten a lot more traffic. The site provides free flash games, so the biggest traffic share goes to serving flash files (from about 100K and up to several megabytes in size each.)     I currently host the entire site on a hosting provider that have no traffic limits. But since they are very cheap (yet have served me very well all the time with at least 99,9% uptime), I don't trust them in allowing me to continue consuming more and more bandwidth. I just guess I'm going to reach some internal limit they have on day, so I'm looking into moving all the flash content over to a content delivery network of some sort.     Some recent traffic stats:   August: 12 GB   September: 22 GB   October: 55 GB   November: Currently 2,3 GB pr day on average, but it's rising..     I've been looking into Amazon S3, but have not decided on anything yet. So therefor I'm asking if there are any other provides I should consider, that operates withi</p><p>4 0.045440044 <a title="1453-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-09-The_Etsy_Saga%3A_From_Silos_to_Happy_to_Billions_of_Pageviews_a_Month.html">1171 high scalability-2012-01-09-The Etsy Saga: From Silos to Happy to Billions of Pageviews a Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Seldom do we get to hear stories of the bumps and bruses earned by a popular website during its formative years.  Ross Snyder , a Sr. Software Engineer at Etsy, changes that with an engaging talk he gave at  Surge 2011 :  Scaling Etsy: What Went Wrong, What Went Right .
 
Ross gives a detailed and honest account of how Etsy went from a raw startup in 2005, to a startup struggling with their success in 2007, to the mean, handmade, super scaling, ops driven machine they’ve become in 2011.   There’s lots to learn from this illuminating story of transformation:
   Origin Story    
   Etsy    is a market for handmade goods. They connect buyers and sellers, similar to eBay, they don’t handle goods.  
 Started: June 2005,  3 guys in an apartment .  
  Today: 250 employees, billions of pageviews a month. All in 6 years.

<p>Introduction: Facebook gave a  MySQL Tech Talk  where they talked about many things MySQL, but one of the more subtle and interesting points was their focus on controlling the variance of request response times and not just worrying about maximizing queries per second.
 
But first the scalability porn. Facebook's OLTP performance numbers were as usual, quite dramatic:
  
 Query response times: 4ms reads, 5ms writes.  
 Rows read per second: 450M peak 
 Network bytes per second: 38GB peak 
 Queries per second: 13M peak 
 Rows changed per second: 3.5M peak 
 InnoDB disk ops per second: 5.2M peak 
  
  Some thoughts on creating quality, not quantity :
  
 They don't care about average response times, instead, they want to minimize variance. Every click must be responded to quickly. The quality of service for each request matters. 
 It's OK if a query is slow as long as it is always slow.  
 They don't try to get the highest queries per second out of each machine. What is important is that the edge case</p><p>6 0.03997514 <a title="1453-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-08-thesimsonstage.ea.com.html">177 high scalability-2007-12-08-thesimsonstage.ea.com</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hibernate and iBATIS and other similar tools have documentation with recommendations for avoiding the "N+1 select" problem.  The problem being that if you wanted to retrieve a set of widgets from a table, one query would be used to to retrieve all the ids of the matching widgets (select widget_id from widget where ...) and then for each id, another select is used to retrieve the details of that widget (select * from widget where widget_id = ?).  If you have 100 widgets, it requires 101 queries to get the details of them all.     I can see why this is bad, but what if you're doing entity caching?  i.e. If you run the first query to get your list of ids, and then for each widget you retrive it from the cache.  Surely in that case, N+1(+caching) is good?  Assuming of course that there is a high probability of all of the matching entities being in the cache.     I may be asking a daft question here - one whose answer is obviously implied by the large scalable mechanisms for storing data th</p><p>3 0.6053043 <a title="1453-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-08-Distribution_of_queries_per_second.html">622 high scalability-2009-06-08-Distribution of queries per second</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We need to measure the number of queries-per-second our site gets for capacity planning purposes.  Obviously, we need to provision the site based on the peak QPS, not average QPS. There will always be some spikes in traffic, though, where for one particular second we get a really huge number of queries. It's ok if site performance slightly degrades during that time. So what I'd really like to do is estimate the *near* peak QPS based on average or median QPS. Near peak might be defined as the QPS that I get at the 95th percentile of the busiest seconds during the day.  My guess is that this is similar to what ISPs do when they measure your bandwidth usage and then charge for usage over the 95th percentile.  What we've done is analyzed our logs, counted the queries executed during each second during the day, sorted from the busiest seconds to the least busy ones, and graphed it. What you get is a histogram that  steeply declines and flattens out near zero.  Does anyone know if there is a</p><p>4 0.57523882 <a title="1453-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-17-Many_updates_against_MySQL.html">366 high scalability-2008-08-17-Many updates against MySQL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hello! My first post here, so be patient please. I am developing site where I have lots of static content. But on many pages I have query to update count of views. I would say this is may cause lots of problems and was interested in another solution like storing these counts somewhere else. As my knowledge is bit limited in this way, I am asking you. I can say I understand PHP(OOP ofc) and MySQL. Nowadays I am getting into servers.     Other question I have is:   I read about making lots of things static.(in Flickr Architecture) and am interested how they do static sites? Lets say they make photo page static? And rebuild when tagg or comment is added? I am bit interested in it as I want to learn Smarty better(newbie) and serving content.     Moreover, how about PHP? I have read many books about PHP theoretically but would love to see some RL example of using objects and exceptions(mainly this as I don't completely understand it) to learn some good programming habits. So if you can help</p><p>5 0.56913519 <a title="1453-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-29-Strategy%3A_Sample_to_Reduce_Data_Set.html">311 high scalability-2008-04-29-Strategy: Sample to Reduce Data Set</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:   Arjen  links to video  Supporting Scalable Online Statistical Processing  which shows "rather than doing complete aggregates, use statistical sampling to provide a reasonable estimate (unbiased guess) of the result."  When you have a lot of data,  sampling  allows you to draw conclusions from a much smaller amount of data. That's why sampling is a scalability solution. If you don't have to process all your data to get the information you need then you've made the problem smaller and you'll need fewer resources and you'll get more timely results.
   
 Sampling is not useful when you need a complete list that matches a specific criteria. If you need to know the exact set of people who bought a car in the last week then sampling won't help.  But, if you want to know many people bought a car then you could take a sample and then create estimate of the full data-set. The difference is you won't really know the exact car count. You'll have a confidence interval saying how confident</p><p>6 0.56069273 <a title="1453-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-25-Who_can_answer_or_analyze_the_image_store_and_visit_solution_about_alibaba.com%3FThanks.html">132 high scalability-2007-10-25-Who can answer or analyze the image store and visit solution about alibaba.com?Thanks</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I read one of these poignantly humorous comics on  Not Invented Here  a while back and since I wasn't sure it was OK to repost I emailed asking for permission. Nada. Then I saw  Martijn de Vrieze  posted a collection of scalability comics from NIH and decided what the heck  (click image to read on site) :
 
   
 
   
 
   
 
   
 
   
 
Thanks to Martijn for  curating the collection  and NIH for creating them.
 
And I agree with Martijn, they do capture an ineffable quality about the entire space.</p><p>2 0.40849978 <a title="1453-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-17-Many_updates_against_MySQL.html">366 high scalability-2008-08-17-Many updates against MySQL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hello! My first post here, so be patient please. I am developing site where I have lots of static content. But on many pages I have query to update count of views. I would say this is may cause lots of problems and was interested in another solution like storing these counts somewhere else. As my knowledge is bit limited in this way, I am asking you. I can say I understand PHP(OOP ofc) and MySQL. Nowadays I am getting into servers.     Other question I have is:   I read about making lots of things static.(in Flickr Architecture) and am interested how they do static sites? Lets say they make photo page static? And rebuild when tagg or comment is added? I am bit interested in it as I want to learn Smarty better(newbie) and serving content.     Moreover, how about PHP? I have read many books about PHP theoretically but would love to see some RL example of using objects and exceptions(mainly this as I don't completely understand it) to learn some good programming habits. So if you can help</p><p>3 0.38524362 <a title="1453-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-21-Paper%3A_Parallelizing_the_Web_Browser.html">660 high scalability-2009-07-21-Paper: Parallelizing the Web Browser</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There have been reports that  software engineering is dead . Maybe, like the future, software engineering is simply not evenly distributed? When you read this paper I think you'll agree there is some real engineering going on, it's just that most of the things we need to build do not require real engineering. Much like my old childhood tree fort could be patched together and was "good enough." This brings to mind the old joke: If a software tree falls in the woods would anyone hear it fall? Only if it tweeted on the way down...  What this paper really showed me is we need not only to change programming practices and constructs, but we also need to design solutions that allow for deep parallelism to begin with. Grafting parallelism on later is difficult. Parallel execution requires knowing precisely how components are dependent on each other and that level of precision tends to go far beyond the human attention span.  In particular this paper deals with how to parallelize the browser on</p><p>4 0.37665647 <a title="1453-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-29-Product%3A_SciDB_-_A_Science-Oriented_DBMS_at_100_Petabytes.html">817 high scalability-2010-04-29-Product: SciDB - A Science-Oriented DBMS at 100 Petabytes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Scientists are doing it for themselves. Doing what? Databases. The idea is that most databases are designed to meet the needs of businesses, not science, so scientists are banding together at  scidb.org  to create their own Domain Specific Database, for science. The goal is to be able to handle datasets in the 100PB range and larger.
  

SciDB, Inc. is building an open source database  technology product designed specifically to satisfy the demands of  data-intensive scientific problems.  With the advice of the world's  leading  scientists across a variety of disciplines including astronomy, biology,   physics, oceanography, atmospheric sciences, and climatology, our  computer  scientists are currently designing and prototyping this technology


The scientists that are participating in our open source project  believe that the SciDB database — when completed — will dramatically  impact their ability to conduct their experiments faster and more  efficiently  and further improve the qual</p><p>5 0.35369354 <a title="1453-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-23-Which_Key_value_pair_database_to_be_used.html">578 high scalability-2009-04-23-Which Key value pair database to be used</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My Table has 2 columsn .Column1 is id,Column2 contains information  given by user about item in Column1 .User can give 3 types of information about item.I separate the opinion of single user by comma,and opinion of another user by ;.   Example-   23-34,us,56;78,in,78   I need to calculate opinions of all users very fast.My idea is to have index on key so the searching would be very fast.Currently i m using mysql .My problem is that maximum column size is below my requirement .If any overflow occurs i make new row with same id and insert data into new row.   Practically I would have around maximum 5-10 for each row.   I think if there is any database which removes this application code.   I just learn about key value pair database which is exactly i needed .   But which doesn't put constraint(i mean much better than RDMS on column size.   This application is not in production.</p><p>6 0.3258206 <a title="1453-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-16-Strategy%3A_Buy_New%2C_Don%27t_Fix_the_Old.html">902 high scalability-2010-09-16-Strategy: Buy New, Don't Fix the Old</a></p>

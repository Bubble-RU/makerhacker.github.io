[sent-22, score-0.164]
</p><p>2 The genius of the codex is that it contains knowledge not in two dimensions, like a roll, but in three. [sent-23, score-0.279]
</p><p>3 The roll has height and width; the codex has height, width, and depth. [sent-24, score-0.507]
</p><p>4 A codex with 200 folios (400 pages), 6 inches wide, has the same potential data-storage area as a roll of the same height that is 200 feet long. [sent-26, score-0.587]
</p><p>5 To access data in a codex, you only have to travel through the depth dimension, which is just a couple of inches thick. [sent-27, score-0.147]
</p><p>6 These coalitions are forged on many levels--between molecules, between cells, between groups of neurons, between individual organisms, between languages, and between ideas. [sent-50, score-0.202]
</p><p>7 Species may in turn form coalitions, and, perhaps, biology may form coalitions with geological and atmospheric processes otherwise viewed as being on the side of nature, not on the side of life. [sent-52, score-0.202]
</p><p>8 These obstacles might suggest division of labor along the lines of programming languages (which likely reflect different concerns and separate components), but as the first chart shows, this is not happening. [sent-64, score-0.161]

</p><p>11 Also a reminder that tools have to work differently at scale. [sent-72, score-0.141]
</p><p>12 Also,MySQL thread pool and scalability examples: Real scalability is when throughput graph is neither dropping or becoming flat - it goes up and up and up with a stable response time. [sent-74, score-0.134]
</p><p>13 Scott Hanselman is "starting to code differently now that I can see the pennies add up based on a specific changes. [sent-88, score-0.149]
</p><p>14 Network alone won't do it: Fiber-to-the-home services provided 18 ms round-trip latency, cable-based services averaged 26 ms, and DSL-based services averaged 43 ms, 4G 150-250ms. [sent-95, score-0.294]
</p><p>15 Plus, we want our recommendation results to be fresh and respond quickly to new data and user actions. [sent-104, score-0.129]

<p>Introduction: OK, thisinterview is with meon Java scalability issues. I sound like a bigger
idiot than I would like, but I suppose it could have been worse. The Java
World folks were very nice and did a good job, so there's no blame on them
:-)The interview went an interesting direction, but there's more I'd like add
and I will do so here. Two major rules regarding Java and scalability have
popped out at me:Java - It's the platform stupid. Java the language isn't the
big win. What is the big win is the ecosystem building up around the JVM,
libraries, and toolsets.Java - It's the community stupid. A lot of creativity
is being expended on leveraging the Java platform to meet scalability
challenges. The amazing community that has built up around Java is pushing
Java to the next level in almost every direction imaginable.The fecundity of
the Java ecosystem can most readily be seen with the efforts to tame our
multi-core future. There's a multi-core crisis going in case you haven't
heard. It's all you'll</p><p>5 0.16561335 <a title="1436-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-07-Startups_are_Creating_a_New_System_of_the_World_for_IT.html">1240 high scalability-2012-05-07-Startups are Creating a New System of the World for IT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: My apologies if you were looking for a post about cell phones. This post is
about high density nanodevices. It's a follow up toHow will memristors change
everything? for those wishing to pursue these revolutionary ideas in more
depth. This is one of those areas where if you are in the space then there's a
lot of available information and if you are on the outside then it doesn't
even seem to exist. Fortunately, Ben Chandler from The SyNAPSE Project, was
kind enough to point me to a great set of presentations given at the12th IEEE
CNNA - International Workshop on Cellular Nanoscale Networks and their
Applications- Towards Megaprocessor Computing. WARNING: these papers contain
extreme technical content. If you are like me and you aren't an electrical
engineer, much of it may make a sort of surface sense, but the deep and twisty
details will fly over head. For the more software minded there are a couple
more accessible presentations:Intelligent Machines built with Memristive

<p>Introduction: Here's a really good article in the Communications of the ACM on reducing
network packet processing overhead by redesigning the network stack:
Revisiting Network I/O APIs: The Netmap Framework by Luigi Rizzo. As commodity
networking performance increases operating systems need to keep up or all
those CPUs will go to waste. How do they make this happen? Abstract:Today
10-gigabit interfaces are used more and more in datacenters and servers. On
these links, packets flow as fast as one every 67.2 nanoseconds, yet modern
operating systems can take 10-20 times longer just to move one packet between
the wire and the application. We can do much better, not with more powerful
hardware but by revising architectural decisions made long ago regarding the
design of device drivers and network stacks.The netmap framework is a
promising step in this direction. Thanks to a careful design and the
engineering of a new packet I/O API, netmap eliminates much unnecessary
overhead and moves traffic up to 40</p><p>2 0.9468143 <a title="1436-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-26-Oculus_Causes_a_Rift%2C_but_the_Facebook_Deal_Will_Avoid_a_Scaling_Crisis_for_Virtual_Reality.html">1619 high scalability-2014-03-26-Oculus Causes a Rift, but the Facebook Deal Will Avoid a Scaling Crisis for Virtual Reality</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Facebook has been teasing us. While many of their recentacquisitionshave been
surprising, shocking is the only word adequately describing Facebook's5 day
whirlwind acquisitionofOculus, immersive virtual reality visionaries, for a
now paltry sounding $2 billion.Thebacklashis a pandemic, jumping acrosssocial
networkswith the speed only a meme powered by the directly unaffected can
generate.For more than 30 years VR has been the dream burning in the heart of
every science fiction fan. Now that this future might finally be here,
Facebook's ownage makes it seem like a wonderful and hopeful timeline has been
choked off, killing the Metaverse before it even had a chance to begin.For the
many who voted for an open future with theirKickstarter dollars, there's a
deep and personal sense of betrayal, despite Facebook's promise to leave
Oculus alone. The intensity of the reaction is because Oculus matters to
people. It's new, it's different, it creates a better future. It's important

<p>Introduction: Every time a technological innovation has spurred automation - since the time
of Henry Ford right up to a minute ago - someone has claimed that machines
will displace human beings. But the rainbow and unicorn dream attributed to
business stakeholders everywhere, i.e. the elimination of IT, is just that - a
dream. It isn't realistic and in fact it's downright silly to think that
systems that only a few years ago were unable to automatically scale up and
scale down will suddenly be able to perform the complex analysis required of
IT to keep the business running.The rare reports of the elimination of IT
staff due tocloud computingand automation are highlighted in the news because
they evoke visceral reactions in technologists everywhere and, to be honest,
they get the click counts rising. But thejury remains out on this oneand in
fact many postulate that it is not a reduction in staff that will occur, but
atransformationof staff, which may eliminate some old timey positions (think

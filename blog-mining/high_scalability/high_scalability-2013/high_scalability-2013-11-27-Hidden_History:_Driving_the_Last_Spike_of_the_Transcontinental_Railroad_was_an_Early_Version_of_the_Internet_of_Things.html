<p>Introduction: By George Palmer of 3dogsbark.com. Covers:   * How you start out: shared hosting,  web server DB on same machine. Move two 2 machines. Minimal code changes.   * Scaling the database. Add read slaves on their own machines. Then master-master setup. Still minimal code changes.   * Scaling the web server. Load balance against multiple application servers. Application servers scale but the database doesn't.   * User clusters. Partition and allocate users to their own dedicated cluster. Requires substantial code changes.   * Caching. A large percentage of hits are read only. Use reverse proxy, memcached, and language specific cache.   * Elastic architectures. Based on Amazon EC2. Start and stop instances on demand. For global applications keep a cache on each continent, assign users to clusters by location, maintain app servers on each continent, use transaction replication software if you must replicate your site globally.</p><p>3 0.080225766 <a title="1555-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-20-It%27s_Networking._In_Space%21_Or_How_E.T._Will_Phone_Home..html">1651 high scalability-2014-05-20-It's Networking.

It's more mundane than that. And in many ways more interesting as it's sort of like the old Internet on steroids, the one that was based on on UUCP and dial-up connections, but over vastly longer distances and with much  longer delays :
  

The Interplanetary Internet (based on IPN, also called InterPlaNet) is a conceived computer network in space, consisting of a set of network nodes which can communicate with each other.[1][2] Communication would be greatly delayed by the great interplanetary distances, so the IPN needs a new set of protocols and technology that are tolerant to large delays and</p><p>3 0.79255646 <a title="1555-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-10-Kill_the_Telcos_Save_the_Internet_-_The_Unsocial_Network.html">1140 high scalability-2011-11-10-Kill the Telcos Save the Internet - The Unsocial Network</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone is killing the Internet. Since you probably use the Internet everyday you might find this surprising. It almost sounds silly, and the reason is technical, but our crack team of networking experts has examined the patient and made the diagnosis. What did they find?
  
  Diagnostic team : the  Packet Pushers  gang ( Greg Ferro ,  Jan Zorz ,  Ivan Pepelnjak ) in the podcast  How We Are Killing the Internet .  
  Diagnosis : invasive tunnelation. ( tubes anyone? ) 
  Prognosis : even Dr. House might not be able to help. 
  Cure : go back to what the Internet was; kill the tunnels; route IPv4 and IPv6; have public addresses on everything; disrupt the telcos. 
  
This is a classic story in a strange setting--the network--but the themes are universal: centralization vs. decentralization (that's where the telcos obviously come in), good vs. evil, order vs. disorder, tyranny vs. freedom, change vs. stasis, simplicity vs. complexity. And it's all being carried out on battlefield few get</p><p>4 0.77227825 <a title="1555-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-02-RFC_1925_-_The_Twelve_%28Timeless%29_Networking_Truths.html">1526 high scalability-2013-10-02-RFC 1925 - The Twelve (Timeless) Networking Truths</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Twelve Networking Truths  is one of a long series of timeless truths documented in sacred   April Fools'  RFC   s. Though issued in 1996, it's no less true today.
 
It's hard to pick a favorite because they are all good. But if I had to pick, it would be:
  

Some things in life can never be fully appreciated nor understood unless experienced firsthand.

  
As we grow comfortable behind garden walls, clutching gadgets like lifelines and ideologies like shields, empathy is the true social network.

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectives  is a series of posts that highlights the ideas that will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires an open mind.     Van Jacobson    Van Jacobson is a Research Fellow at   PARC  . Prior to that he was Chief Scientist and co-founder of Packet Design. Prior to that he was Chief Scientist at Cisco. Prior to that he was head of the Network Research group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He's been studying networking since 1969. He still hopes that someday something will start to make sense.    Scaling the Internet – Does the Net needs an upgrade?    As the Internet is being overrun with video traffic, many wonder if it can survive.

<p>Introduction: The story of driving the  golden spike  to symbolize the completion of the  transcontinental railroad  is famous in the US. What is not so well known is the story of how it also foreshadowed changes to come as an early version of both the Internet and the Internet of Things. But that was 1869, how can that possibly be?
  Telegraph as Internet  
First, let's establish the telegraph and cable systems was an early version of an Internet.
 
As railroad tracks were being laid a  transcontental telegraph  system was also being constructed. Telegraph lines were installed parallel to the tracks making instant communication available across the continent, faster than any horse could ride.
 
With the  transalantic cable system  information could quickly span continents in minutes:
  

The miles of American telegraph grew from 40 in 1846 to 12,000 in 1850 to 23,000 in 1852. In Europe it increased from 2,000 in 1849 to 110,000 in 1869. The cost of sending 10 words was $1.55 in 1850, $1 in 1870, 40</p><p>3 0.69107151 <a title="1555-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-13-Product%3A_Gearman_-_Open_Source_Message_Queuing_System.html">491 high scalability-2009-01-13-Product: Gearman - Open Source Message Queuing System</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:   New Gearman Server & Library in C, MySQL UDFs .   Gearman  is an open source  message queuing  system that makes it easy to do distributed job processing using multiple languages.  With Gearman you:  farm out work to other machines, dispatching function calls to machines that are better suited to do work, to do work in parallel, to load balance lots of function calls, to call functions between languages, spread CPU usage around your network .   Gearman is used by companies like LiveJournal, Yahoo!, and Digg. Digg, for example, runs 300,000 jobs a day through Gearman without any issues. Most large sites use something similar. Why would anyone ever even need a message queuing system?
   
 Message queuing is a handy way to move work off your web servers (like image manipulation),  to generate thousands of documents in the background, to run the multiple requests in parallel needed to build a web page, or to perform tasks that can comfortably be run in the background and not part</p><p>4 0.64557528 <a title="1555-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-05-10_Things_You_Should_Know_About_AWS.html">1543 high scalability-2013-11-05-10 Things You Should Know About AWS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Authored by  Chris Fregly   :  Former Netflix Streaming Platform Engineer, AWS Certified Solution Architect and Purveyor of fluxcapacitor.com.  
   Ahead of the upcoming 2nd annual re:Invent conference, inspired by Simone Brunozzi’s recent    presentation    at an AWS Meetup in San Francisco, and collected from a few of my recent    Fluxcapacitor.com    consulting engagements, I’ve compiled a list of 10 useful time and clock-tick saving tips about AWS. 
    1) Query AWS resource metadata  
      
   Can’t remember the EBS-Optimized IO throughput of your c1.xlarge cluster?  How about the size limit of an S3 object on a single PUT?     awsnow.info    is the answer to all of your AWS-resource metadata questions.  Interested in integrating awsnow.info with your application?  You’re in luck.  There’s now a    REST API   , as well! 
   Note:  These are default soft limits and will vary by account. 
    2) Tame your S3 buckets  
       
   Delete an entire S3 bucket with a single CLI command:</p><p>5 0.64328957 <a title="1555-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-28-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_28th%2C_2014.html">1621 high scalability-2014-03-28-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 28th, 2014</a></p>

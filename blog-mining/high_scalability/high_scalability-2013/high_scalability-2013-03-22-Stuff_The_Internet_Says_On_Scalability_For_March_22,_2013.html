<p>Introduction: This is a repost of part 2 (part 1) of an interviewI did for theBoundary
blog.Boundary:  There's another battle coming down the pike between Amazon
(AWS) and Google (GCE). How should the CTO decide which one's best?Hoff: Given
that GCE is still closed to public access we have very little common
experience on which to judge. The best way to decide is as always, by running
a few experiments. Pick a few representative projects, a representative team,
implement the projects on both infrastructures, crunch some numbers, figure
out the bigger picture and then select the one you wanted in the first place
.Sebastian Stadil, founder of Scalr, recently wrote about his experiences on
both platforms and found some interesting differences: AWS has a much richer
set of services; GCE is on-demand only, so AWS can be cheaper; GCE has faster
disk and faster network IO, especially between datacenters; GCE has faster
boot times and can mount read-only partitions across multiple machines; and
GCE shares i</p><p>3 0.30760118 <a title="1428-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-02-C_is_for_Compute_-_Google_Compute_Engine_%28GCE%29.html">1275 high scalability-2012-07-02-C is for Compute - Google Compute Engine (GCE)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After poking around theGoogle Compute Engine(GCE) documentation I had some
trouble creating a mental model of how GCE works. Is it like AWS, GAE,
Rackspace, just what is it? After watchingGoogle I/O 2012 - Introducing Google
Compute EngineandGoogle Compute Engine -- Technical Details, it turns out my
initial impression, that GCE is disarmingly straightforward, turns out to be
the point.The focus of GCE is on the C, which stands for Compute, and that's
what GCE is all about: deploying lots of servers to solve computationally hard
problems. What you get with GCE is a Super Datacenter on Google Steroids.If
you are wondering how you will run the next Instagram on GCE then that would
be missing the point. GAE is targeted at applications. GCE is targeted
at:Delivering a proven, pure, high performance, high scale compute
infrastructure using a utility pricing model, on top of an open, secure,
extensible Infrastructure-as-a-Service.Delivering an experience that feels
like you are in a datacent</p><p>4 0.22803077 <a title="1428-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-08-NuoDB%27s_First_Experience%3A_Google_Compute_Engine_-_1.8_Million_Transactions_Per_Second.html">1437 high scalability-2013-04-08-NuoDB's First Experience: Google Compute Engine - 1.8 Million Transactions Per Second</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a repost of the blog entry written by NuoDB's Tommy Reilly.  We
atNuoDBwere recently given the opportunity to kick the tires on the Google
Compute Engine by our friends over at Google. You can watch the entire Google
Developer Live Session by clickinghere.  In order to access the capabilities
of GCE we decided to run the same YCSB based benchmark we ran at our General
Availability Launch back in January. For those of you who missed it we
demonstrated running the YCSB benchmark on a 24 machine cluster running on our
private cloud in the NuoDB datacenter. The salient results were 1.7 million
transactions per second with sub-millisecond latencies.Public cloud
environments typically mean virtualization, inconsistent network performance
and potentially slow or low bandwidth disk access. It just so happens that
NuoDB was designed to work well in such harsh environments (we don't call it a
cloud database for nothing). Still, the faster the CPU, network and disk the
faster the database</p><p>5 0.1435962 <a title="1428-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-03-Product%3A_nginx.html">314 high scalability-2008-05-03-Product: nginx</a></p>

WordPress.com moved from Pound to Nginx and are now "regularly serving about
8-9k requests/second and about 1.2Gbit/sec through a few Nginx instances and
have plenty of room to grow!".Update 4:Nginx better than Pound for load

and better documented.Update 3: igvita.com combines two cool tools together
for better performance inNginx and Memcached, a 400% boost!.Update 2: Software

<p>Introduction: Making the world's knowledge computableToday's Wolfram|Alpha is the first step
in an ambitious, long-term project to make all systematic knowledge
immediately computable by anyone. You enter your question or calculation, and
Wolfram|Alpha uses its built-in algorithms and growing collection of data to
compute the answer.Answer Engine vs Search EngineWhenWolfram|Alphalaunches
later today, it will beone of the most computationally intensive websites on
the internet. TheWolfram|Alpha computational knowledge engineis an "answer
engine" that is able to produce answers to various questions such asWhat is

cloud platform are a constant drain of money.Update 4:Caching becomes even
more important inCPU based billing environments. Avoiding the CPU means saving
money.Update 3:An interesting simple example of this idea showed up on the
Google AppEngine list. With one paging algorithm and one use of AJAX the
yearly cost of the site was $1000. By changing those algorithms the site went
under quota and became free again. This will make life a lot more interesting
for developers.Update 2:Business Model Influencing Software Architectureby

<p>Introduction: A lot of new internet TV station startups are in the wind these days and
there's a question about how they can scale their broadcasts. Today's state of
the art shows you can't yet mimic the reach of broadcast TV with internet
tech. But as Oprah proves, you can still capture a lot of eyeballs, if you are
Oprah...Oprah drew a stunning 500,000 simultaneous viewers for an Eckhart
Tolle webcast. Move Networks and Limelight Networks hosted the "broadcast"
where traffic peaked at 242Gbps. A variable bitrate scheme was used so
depending on their connection, a viewer could have seen 150Kbps or as high as
750Kbps.Dan Rayburn thinksThe big take away from this webcast is that it shows
proof that the Internet is not built to handle TV like distribution and those
who think that live TV shows will be broadcast on the Internet with millions
and millions of people watching, it's just not going to happen.breakTo handle
more users comments suggested capping the bitrate at 300K, using P2P
streaming, or us</p><p>4 0.92408228 <a title="1428-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-24-Product%3A__Hibernate_Shards.html">24 high scalability-2007-07-24-Product:  Hibernate Shards</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you want to adopt a shard architecture, but don't want to start from
scratch, you may want to consider Hibernate's sharding system.Hibernate Shards
is a framework that is designed to encapsulate and minimize this complexity by
adding support for horizontal partitioning to Hibernate Core.Hibernate
Shardskey features:Standard Hibernate programming model - Hibernate Shards
allows you to continue using the Hibernate APIs you know and love:
SessionFactory, Session, Criteria, Query. If you already know how to use
Hibernate, you already know how to use Hibernate Shards.Flexible sharding
strategies - Distribute data across your shards any way you want. Use one of
the default strategies we provide or plug in your own application-specific
logic.Support for virtual shards - Think your sharding strategy is never going
to change? Think again. Adding new shards and redistributing your data is one
of the toughest operational challenges you will face once you've deployed your

of Rackspace, I've still waited for over an hour for Dominos to actually

an end product of technological evolution and more important as catalysts
facilitating evolutionary processes through the incubation and propagation of

<p>Introduction: This is an unusually well written anduseful paper. It talks in detail about
experiences implementing a complex project, something we don't see very often.
They shockingly even admit that creating a working implementation of Paxos was
more difficult than just translating the pseudo code. Imagine that,
programmers aren't merely typists! I particularly like the explanation of the
Paxos algorithm and why anyone would care about it, working with disk
corruption, using leases to support simultaneous reads, using epoch numbers to
indicate a new master election, using snapshots to prevent unbounded logs,
using MultiOp to implement database transactions, how they tested the system,
and their openness with the various problems they had. A lot to learn
here.From the paper:We describe our experience building a fault-tolerant data-
base using the Paxos consensus algorithm. Despite the existing literature in
the field, building such a database proved to be non-trivial. We describe

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.If datacenters are the
new castles, then what will be the new gunpowder? As soon asgunpowdercame on
the scene, castles, which are defensive structures, quickly became the
future's cold, drafty hotels. Gunpowder fueled cannon balls make short work of
castle walls.There's a long history of "gunpowder" type inventions in the tech
industry. PCs took out the timeshare model. The cloud is taking out the PC
model. There must be something that will take out the cloud.Right now it's
hard to believe the cloud will one day be no more. They seem so much the
future, but something will transcend the cloud. We even have a law that says
so:Bell's Law of Computer Classeswhich holds thatroughly every decade a new,
lower priced computer class forms based on a new programming platform,
network, and interface resulting in new usage and the establishment of a new
industry.Acomputer</p><p>6 0.13175128 <a title="1451-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-07-RAFT_-_In_Search_of_an_Understandable_Consensus_Algorithm.html">1498 high scalability-2013-08-07-RAFT - In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm</a></p>

YSlow to speed up a website with solid code examples.Every layer in the multi-

<p>Introduction: I've largely steered clear of publicly commenting on the "NoSQL vs.
Relational" conflict. Keeping in mind that this argument is more about
currently available solutions and the features their developers have chosen to
build in, I'd like to dig into this and provide a decidedly neutral viewpoint.
In fact, by erring on the side of caution, I've inadvertently given myself
plenty of time to consider the pros and cons of both data storage approaches,
and although my mind was initially swaying toward the NoSQL camp, I can say
with a fair amount of certainty, that I've found a good compromise. You can

<p>Introduction: Scoblethe Ubiquitous has a fascinating post on how Mogulus, a live video
channel startup, uses S3/EC2 and doesn't own a single server. The trends that
have been happening for a while now are going mainstream. To do great things
you no longer need to start by creating a huge war chest. You can forage off
the land, like any good mobile, light weight fighting unit.For a strategy hit
he mentions the same needed change in perspective as Beau Lebens talked about
when makingFeedBlendr:One tip he gave us is that when using Amazon’s services
you have to design your systems with the assumption that they will never be up
and running. What he means by that is services are “volatile” and can go up
and down without notice. So, he’s designed his systems to survive that. He
told me that it meant his engineering teams had to be quite disciplined in
designing their architecture.</p><p>4 0.91572315 <a title="1451-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-07-Analyzing_billions_of_credit_card_transactions_and_serving_low-latency_insights_in_the_cloud.html">1382 high scalability-2013-01-07-Analyzing billions of credit card transactions and serving low-latency insights in the cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byIvan de PradoandPere Ferrera, founders ofDatasalt, the
company behindPangoolandSplout SQLBig Data open-source projects.The amount of
payments performed using credit cards is huge. It is clear that there is
inherent value in the data that can be derived from analyzing all the
transactions. Client fidelity, demographics, heat maps of activity, shop
recommendations, and many other statistics are useful to both clients and
shops for improving their relationship with the market. AtDatasaltwe have
developed a system in collaboration with theBBVA bankthat is able to analyze
years of data and serve insights and statistics to different low-latency web
and mobile applications.The main challenge we faced besides processing Big
Data input is thatthe output was also Big Data, and even bigger than the
input. And this output needed to be served quickly, under high load.The
solution we developed has an infrastructure cost of just a few thousands of
dollars per month thanks to th</p><p>5 0.9050405 <a title="1451-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-11-Yahoo_Live%27s_Scaling_Problems_Prove%3A_Release_Early_and_Often_-_Just_Don%27t_Screw_Up.html">244 high scalability-2008-02-11-Yahoo Live's Scaling Problems Prove: Release Early and Often - Just Don't Screw Up</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tech Crunch chomped down on some initial scaling problems with Yahoo's new
live video streaming serviceYahoo Live. After a bit of chewing on Yahoo's old
bones, TC spat out:If Yahoo cant scale something like this (no matter how much
they claim it’s an experiment, it’s still a live service), it shows how far
the once brightest star of the online world has fallen.This kind of thinking
kills innovation. When there's no room for a few hiccups or a little failure
you have to cover your ass so completely nothing new will ever see the light
of day.breakI thought we were supposed to beagile. We are supposed to release
early and often. Not every 'i' has to be dotted and not every last router has
to be installed before we take the first step of a grand new journey.Get it
out there. Let users help you make it better. Listen to customers, make
changes, push the new code out, listen some more, and fix problems as they
come up. Following this process we'll make something the customer wants and
needs</p><p>same-blog 6 0.89605993 <a title="1451-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-03-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_3%2C_2013.html">1451 high scalability-2013-05-03-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 3, 2013</a></p>

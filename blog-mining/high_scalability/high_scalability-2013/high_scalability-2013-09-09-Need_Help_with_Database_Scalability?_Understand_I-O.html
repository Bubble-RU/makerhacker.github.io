</p><p>3 A range query used to retrieve 100 documents may induce 1 I/O, whereas 100 point queries to retrieve 100 documents may induce 100 I/O’s. [sent-38, score-1.791]
</p><p>4 Using an index on a collection, this does a combination of range queries and point queries. [sent-47, score-0.63]
</p><p>5 If not, then a combination of range queries and point queries are used. [sent-49, score-0.919]
</p><p>6 One can reduce the I/O of the application by avoiding doing individual point queries to retrieve each document . [sent-74, score-0.715]
</p><p>7 To do this, we use covering or clustering indexes that smartly filter the documents analyzed by the query, and can  report results using range queries . [sent-75, score-0.727]
</p><p>8 If you have an OLTP application and your queries are essentially point queries (because they retrieve very few documents), then even with proper indexes, you may still have an I/O bottleneck. [sent-77, score-1.033]
</p><p>9 Also, additional indexes increase the cost of insertions, as each insertion must keep the indexes up to date as well, but write-optimized databases mitigate that cost. [sent-79, score-0.567]
</p><p>10 Updates and deletes are tricky in that they are a combination of queries and inserts. [sent-83, score-0.461]
</p><p>11 Read scaling via replication    Read scaling with replication is effective for applications where queries are the bottleneck. [sent-110, score-0.435]
</p><p>12 If inserts, updates, or deletes are your bottleneck, then replication may not be very effective, because the write work is duplicated on all servers that are added to the replica set. [sent-112, score-0.628]
</p><p>13 Sharding        Sharding    partitions your data across different replica sets based on a shard key. [sent-114, score-0.664]
</p><p>14 Different replica sets in the cluster are responsible for ranges of values in the shard key space. [sent-115, score-0.719]
</p><p>15 So, an application’s write throughput is increased by spreading the write workload across separate replica sets in a cluster. [sent-116, score-0.595]
</p><p>16 By partitioning the data by ranges in the shard key space, queries that use the shard key can effectively do range queries on a few shards, making such queries very efficient. [sent-118, score-1.9]
</p><p>17 If one makes the shard key a hash, then all range queries must run on all shards in the cluster, but point queries on the shard key run on single shards. [sent-119, score-1.684]
</p><p>18 A  good shard key  has the following properties:    ●    Many (if not all) of your queries  use the shard key . [sent-129, score-0.987]
</p><p>19 ●    The shard key should do a good job of  distributing writes  to different replica sets in the cluster. [sent-132, score-0.726]
</p><p>20 If all writes are directed to the same replica set in the cluster, then that replica set becomes a bottleneck for writes, just as it was in a non- sharded  setup. [sent-133, score-0.615]

<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great scalability solution, but caching also  comes with problems .  Sharding  is a great scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in a  post-mortem  about their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database Foursquare uses, also contributed their  post-mortem  of what went wrong too.
 
Now that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?
 
First, like for  Facebook , huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in a pretty cool industry.
 
Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built by a small group of people, under immense pressure</p><p>3 0.24869357 <a title="1514-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-06-An_Unorthodox_Approach_to_Database_Design_%3A_The_Coming_of_the_Shard.html">672 high scalability-2009-08-06-An Unorthodox Approach to Database Design : The Coming of the Shard</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Pinterest has been riding an exponential growth curve, doubling every month
and half. They've gone from 0 to 10s of billions of page views a month in two
years, from 2 founders and one engineer to over 40 engineers, from one little
MySQL server to 180 Web Engines, 240 API Engines, 88 MySQL DBs (cc2.8xlarge) +
1 slave each, 110 Redis Instances, and 200 Memcache Instances.Stunning growth.
So what's Pinterest's story? To tell their story we have our bards,
Pinterest'sYashwanth NelapatiandMarty Weiner, who tell the dramatic story of
Pinterest's architecture evolution in a talk titledScaling Pinterest. This is
the talk they would have liked to hear a year and half ago when they were
scaling fast and there were a lot of options to choose from. And they made a
lot of incorrect choices.This is a great talk. It's full of amazing details.
It's also very practical, down to earth, and it contains strategies adoptable
by nearly anyone. Highly recommended.Two of my favorite lessons from the

<p>Introduction: I met the CodeFutures folks, makers of  dbShards , at  Gluecon . They occupy an interesting niche in the database space, somewhere between  NoSQL , which jettisons everything SQL, and  high end analytics platforms  that completely rewrite the backend while keeping a SQL facade.
 
High concept: I think of dbShards as a sort of commercial OLTP mashup of features from  HSCALE  (partitioning) +  MySQL Proxy  (transparent intermediate layer) +  Memcached  (client side sharding) +  Gigaspaces  (parallel query) + MySQL (transactions).
 
You may find dbShards interesting if you are looking to keep SQL, need scale out writes and reads, need out of the box parallel query capabilities, and would prefer to use a standard platform like MySQL as a base. To learn more about dbShards I asked Cory Isaacson (CEO and CTO) a few devastatingly difficult questions (not really).
  Who are you, what is dbShards, and what problem was dbShards created to solve?

<p>Introduction: The key (no pun intended) to understanding how to organize your dataset’s data is to think of each shard not as an individual database, but as one large singular database. Just as in a normal single server database setup where you have a unique key for each row within a table, each row key within each individual shard must be unique to the whole dataset partitioned across all shards.     There are a few different ways we can accomplish uniqueness of row keys across a shard cluster. Each has its pro’s and con’s and the one chosen should be specific to the problems you’re trying to solve.</p><p>5 0.83232856 <a title="1514-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-26-Sharding_the_Hibernate_Way.html">358 high scalability-2008-07-26-Sharding the Hibernate Way</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update :  A very nice JavaWorld podcast interview with  Google engineer Max Ross on Hibernate Shards . Max defines Hibernate Shards (horizontal partitioning), how it works (pretty well), virtual shards (don't ask), what they need to do in the future (query, replication, operational tools), and how it relates to Google AppEngine (not much).   To scale you are supposed to partition your data. Sounds good, but how do you do it? When you actually sit down to work out all the details it’s not that easy. Hibernate Shards to the rescue! Hibernate shards is: an extension to the core Hibernate product that adds facilities for horizontal partitioning. If you know the core Hibernate API you know the shards API. No learning curve at all. Here is what a few members of the core group had to say about the Hibernate Shards open source project. Although there are some limitations, from the sound of it they are doing useful stuff in the right way and it’s very much worth looking at, especially if you us</p><p>6 0.82001674 <a title="1514-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles_with_Sharding_-_What_can_we_learn_from_the_Foursquare_Incident%3F.html">920 high scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles with Sharding - What can we learn from the Foursquare Incident?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Tim Bray  has a wonderful  interview with Casey Forbes , creator of Ravelry, a Ruby on Rails site supporting a 400,000+ strong community of dedicated knitters and crocheters.   Casey and his small team have done great things with Ravelry. It is a very focused site that provides a lot of value for users. And users absolutely adore the site. That's obvious from their enthusiastic comments and rocket fast adoption of Ravelry.  Ten years ago a site like Ravelry would have been a multi-million dollar operation. Today Casey is the sole engineer for Ravelry and to run it takes only a few people. He was able to code it in 4 months working nights and weekends. Take a look down below of all the technologies used to make Ravelry and you'll see how it is constructed almost completely from free of the shelf software that Casey has stitched together into a complete system. There's an amazing amount of leverage in today's ecosystem when you combine all the quality tools, languages, storage, bandwidth</p><p>same-blog 5 0.96966362 <a title="1514-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-09-Need_Help_with_Database_Scalability%3F_Understand_I-O.html">1514 high scalability-2013-09-09-Need Help with Database Scalability?

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Zardosht Kasheff , Software Developer at  Tokutek , a storage engine company that delivers 21st-Century capabilities to the leading open source data management platforms. 
 
As software developers, we value abstraction. The simpler the API, the more attractive it becomes. Arguably, MongoDB’s greatest strengths are its elegant API and its   agility  , which let developers simply code.
 
But when  MongoDB  runs into scalability problems on  big data , developers need to peek underneath the covers to understand the underlying issues and how to fix them. Without understanding, one may end up with an inefficient solution that costs time and money. For example, one may shard prematurely, increasing hardware and management costs, when a simpler replication setup would do. Or, one may increase the size of a replica set when upgrading to SSDs would suffice.

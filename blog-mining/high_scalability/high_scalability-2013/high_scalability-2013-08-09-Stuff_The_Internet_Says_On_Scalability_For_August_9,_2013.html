<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear?

Test your sense of scale. Is this image of something microscopic or macroscopic?  Find out .

   
  26,496 : number of cores in Amazon's supercomputer;  128 billion : WDC's huge web graph publicly available;  400 million : Snapchat more photos than Facebook per day;  300,000 : Microsoft's servers for Xbox;  1 million : MessageMe user growth in one week 
 Quotable Quotes:                           
 
  Jony Ive : I feel that ideas are very fragile, so you have to be tender when they are in development. I realized that if he pissed on this, it would be so sad because I know it was so important. 
  @BenedictEvans : 100m users is the new 1m users. $4bn is the new $400m. 30 staff is the new 300 staff. 
  @postwait : Knowing the latency of every I/O on every spindle in every machine in every rack... over all of time. Done & eye-opening. Thanks @circonus. 
  @mrb_bk : Things that hurt: unbounded memory growth. Things that help: concurrency control.

 Quotable Quotes:                          
 
 Aristotle: We must not expect more precision than the subject-matter admits. 
  Bret Victor : Technologies change quickly and minds change slowly. Ideas require people to unlearn what they’ve learned and adopt new ideas. They think what they’ve learned is programming and this new stuff isn’t programming. 
 Steven Roberts: Art without engineering is dreaming; engineering without art is calculating.  
  @jamesurquhart : “@b6n: @jamesurquhart @krishnan @rUv There is no such thing as traditional infrastructure at web scale.” < My point exactly. 
 HackerNewsOnion: Batch is the new realtime.  
  @rbranson : "How do we store this at scale?" "Redis on a cr1.8xlarge" "lmao" 
  John Carmack : We are fundamentally creativity bound at this point. We need faster iterations.

<p>Introduction: Bees have a similar problem to website servers: how to do a lot of work with limited resources in an ever changing environment. Usually lessons from biology are hard to apply to computer problems. Nature throws hardware at problems. Billions and billions of cells cooperate at different levels of organizations to find food, fight lions, and make sure your DNA is passed on.   Nature's software is "simple," but her hardware rocks. We do the opposite. For us hardware is in short supply so we use limited hardware and leverage "smart" software to work around our inability to throw hardware at problems. But we might be able to borrow some load balancing techniques from bees. What do bees do that we can learn from?
 
Bees do a dance to indicate the quality and location of a nectar source. When a bee finds a better source they do a better dance and resources shift to the new location.  This approach may seem inefficient, but it turns out to be "optimal for the unpredictable nectar world."

 Storing  700 terabytes of data into a single gram of DNA . Downside, reading  is very slow . And any data might conflict with the messages aliens have already inserted.

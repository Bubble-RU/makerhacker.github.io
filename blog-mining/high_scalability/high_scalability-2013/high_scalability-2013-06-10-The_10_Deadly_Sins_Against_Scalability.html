  1. TWO-PHASE COMMIT  
Normally when data is changed in a database, it is written both to memory and to disk. When a commit happens, a relational database makes a commitment to freeze the data somewhere on real storage media. Remember, memory doesn't survive a crash or reboot. Even if the data is cached in memory, the database still has to write it to disk. MySQL binary logs or Oracle redo logs fit the bill.
 
With a MySQL cluster or distributed file system such as DRBD (Distributed Replicated Block Device) or Amazon Multi-AZ (Multi-Availability Zone), a commit occurs not only locally, but also at the remote end. A two-phase commit means waiting for an acknowledgment from the far end. Because of network and other latency, those commits can be slowed down by milliseconds, as though all the cars on a highway were slowe</p><p>4 0.13216104 <a title="1473-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-09-Data_Replication_in_NoSQL_Databases.html">1279 high scalability-2012-07-09-Data Replication in NoSQL Databases</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is the third guest post  (  part 1  ,   part 2  ) of a series by Greg Lindahl, CTO of blekko, the spam free search engine. Previously, Greg was Founder and Distinguished Engineer at PathScale, at which he was the architect of the InfiniPath low-latency InfiniBand HCA, used to build tightly-coupled supercomputing clusters. 
 
blekko's home-grown NoSQL database was designed from the start to support a web-scale search engine, with 1,000s of servers and petabytes of disk. Data replication is a very important part of keeping the database up and serving queries.  Like many NoSQL database authors, we decided to keep R=3 copies of each piece of data in the database, and not use RAID to improve reliability. The key goal we were shooting for was a database which degrades gracefully when there are many small failures over time, without needing human intervention.
  Why don't we like RAID for big NoSQL databases?  
Most big storage systems use RAID levels like 3, 4, 5, or 10 to improve relia</p><p>5 0.13020517 <a title="1473-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-01-Product%3A_MogileFS.html">53 high scalability-2007-08-01-Product: MogileFS</a></p>

<p>Introduction: What do you get when you take a SQL database and start a new implementation from scratch, taking advantage of the latest research and modern hardware?  Mike Stonebraker , the sword wielding Johnny Appleseed of the database world, hopes you get something like his new database,  VoltDB : a pure SQL, pure ACID, pure OLTP, shared nothing, sharded, scalable, lockless, open source, in-memory DBMS, purpose-built for running hundreds of thousands of transactions a second. VoltDB  claims to be  100 times faster than MySQL, up to 13 times faster than  Cassandra , and 45 times faster than Oracle, with near-linear scaling.
  Will VoltDB kill off the new NoSQL upstarts? Will VoltDB cause a mass extinction of ancient databases? Probably no and no to both questions, but it's a product with a definite point-of-view and is worth a look as the transaction component in your system. But will it be right for you? Let's see...

<p>Introduction: In the moral realm there may be 7 deadly sins, but scalability maven  Sean Hull  has come up  Five More Things Deadly to Scalability  that when added to his earlier  5 Things That are Toxic to Scalability , make for a numerologically satisfying 10 sins again scalability:
  
  Slow Disk I/O – RAID 5   – Multi-tenant EBS . Use RAID 10, it provides  good protection along with good read and write performance. The design of RAID 5 means poor performance and long repair times on failure. On AWS consider Provisioned IOPS as a way around IO bottlenecks. 
  Using the database for Queuing.  The database may seem like the perfect place to keep work queues, but under load locking and scanning overhead kills performance. Use specialized products like RabbitMQ and SQS to remove this bottleneck. 
  Using Database for full-text searching.  Search seems like another perfect database feature. At scale search doesn't perform well. Use specialized technologies like Solr or Sphinx.

<p>Introduction: This question was asked over email and I thought a larger audience might want to take a whack at it. 
 
I have a problem I’d like to have your view on. I’ve looked around a lot, and I haven’t found a definite answer. The question is this:
  Is it true that for a scalable web-based system targeting millions of users (hopefully), using Microsoft technology(.Net/SQL Server) over open source technologies like python/ruby/php and mysql (mariadb) / postgresql will cost you more? Is there any justification for paying up for Microsoft licenses(OS, SQL Server, …)?
 
I am in charge of selecting the technology toolbox for a startup which is going to build a scalable public web platform. I’ve worked as a developer and database developer/admin (mainly as a DBA) using different platforms and technologies, but my main focus is on Microsoft technology. I’ve considered all other important factors for this decision, and at the end, I always come back to the question of money. When I finish developing th</p><p>4 0.90075672 <a title="1473-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-21-The_Conspecific_Hybrid_Cloud.html">1212 high scalability-2012-03-21-The Conspecific Hybrid Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When you’re looking to add new tank mates to an existing aquarium  ecosystem, one of the concerns you must have is whether a particular  breed of fish is amenable to conspecific cohabitants. Many species are  not, which means if you put them together in a confined space, they’re  going to fight. Viciously. To the death. Responsible aquarists try to  avoid such situations, so careful attention to the  conspecificity  of animals is a must.
 
Now,  while in many respects the data center ecosystem correlates well to an  aquarium ecosystem, in this case it does not. It’s what you usually get,  today, but its not actually the best model. That’s because what you  want in the data center ecosystem – particularly when it extends to  include public  cloud computing   resources – is conspecificity in infrastructure.
 
This  desire and practice is being seen both in enterprise data center  decision making as well as in startups suddenly dealing with massive  growth and increasingly encountering pe</p><p>5 0.89706236 <a title="1473-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-17-7_Lessons_Learned_While_Building_Reddit_to_270_Million_Page_Views_a_Month.html">828 high scalability-2010-05-17-7 Lessons Learned While Building Reddit to 270 Million Page Views a Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Steve Huffman , co-founder of social news site  Reddit , gave an excellent  presentation  ( slides ,  transcript ) on the lessons he learned while building and growing Reddit to 7.5 million users per month, 270 million page views per month, and 20+ database servers.
 
Steve says a lot of the lessons were really obvious, so you may not find a lot of completely new ideas in the presentation. But Steve has an earnestness and genuineness about him that is so obviously grounded in experience that you can't help but think deeply about what you could be doing different. And if Steve didn't know about these lessons, I'm betting others don't either.
 
There are seven lessons, each has their own summary section: Lesson one: Crash Often; Lesson 2: Separation of Services; Lesson 3: Open Schema; Lesson 4: Keep it Stateless; Lesson 5: Memcache; Lesson 6: Store Redundant Data; Lesson 7: Work Offline.
 
By far the most surprising feature of their architecture is in Lesson Six, whose essential idea is:</p><p>6 0.89581555 <a title="1473-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-30-Basho_Lives_up_to_their_Name_With_Consistent_Smashing.html">868 high scalability-2010-07-30-Basho Lives up to their Name With Consistent Smashing</a></p>

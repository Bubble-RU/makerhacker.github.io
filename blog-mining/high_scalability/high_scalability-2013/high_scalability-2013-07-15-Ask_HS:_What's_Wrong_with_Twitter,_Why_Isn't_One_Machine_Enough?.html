<p>Introduction: Toy solutions solving Twitter's "problems" are a favorite scalability trope.
Everybody has this idea that Twitter is easy. With a little architectural hand
waving we have a scalable Twitter, just that simple. Well, it's not that
simple asRaffi Krikorian, VP of Engineering at Twitter, describes in his
superb and very detailed presentation onTimelines at Scale. If you want to
know how Twitter works - then start here.It happened gradually so you may have
missed it, but Twitter has grown up. It started as a strugglingthree-tierish
Ruby on Railswebsite to become a beautifully service driven core that we
actually go to now to see if other services are down. Quite a change.Twitter
now has 150M world wide active users, handles 300K QPS to generate timelines,
and a firehose that churns out 22 MB/sec. 400 million tweets a day flow
through the system and it can take up to 5 minutes for a tweet to flow from
Lady Gaga's fingers to her 31 million followers.A couple of points stood

<p>Introduction: Jeremy Cole, a DBA Team Lead/Database Architect at Twitter, gave a really good
talk at the O'Reilly MySQL conference:Big and Small Data at @Twitter, where
the topic was thinking of Twitter from the data perspective.One of the
interesting stories he told was of the transition from Twitter's old way of
storing tweets using temporalsharding, to a more distributed approach using a
new tweet store called T-bird, which is built on top ofGizzard, which is built
using MySQL.Twitter's original tweet store:Temporally sharded tweets was a
good-idea-at-the-time architecture. Temporal sharding simply means tweets from
the same date range are stored together on the same shard.The problem is
tweets filled up one machine, then a second, and then a third. You end up
filling up one machine after another.This is a pretty common approach and one
that has some real flaws:Load balancing. Most of the old machines didn't get
any traffic because people are interested in what is happening now, especially
with T</p><p>4 0.19838852 <a title="1491-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-07-Six_Ways_Twitter_May_Reach_its_Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal_of_One_Billion_Users.html">837 high scalability-2010-06-07-Six Ways Twitter May Reach its Big Hairy Audacious Goal of One Billion Users</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Twitter has a big hairy audacious goal of reaching one billion users by 2013.
Three forces stand against Twitter. The world will end in2012. But let's be
optimistic and assume we'll make it. Next is Facebook. Currently Facebook is
the user leader with over 400 million users. Will Facebook stumble or will
they rocket to one billion users before Twitter? And lastly, there's Twitter's
"low" starting point and "slow" growth rate. Twitter currently has106
millionregistered users and adds about 300,000 new users a day. That doesn't
add up to a billion in three years. Twitter needs to triple the number of
registered users they add per day. How will Twitter reach its goal of over one
billion users served?From recent infrastructure announcements and information
gleaned atChirp (videos) and other talks, it has become a little clearer how
they hope to reach their billion user goal: 1) Make a Big Hairy Audacious Goal
2) Hire Lots of Quality People 3) Hug Developers and Users 4) Drive the

<p>Introduction: Update 6:Some interesting changes from Twitter'sEvan Weaver: everything in RAM
now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by
average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page
cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with
Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every
external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to
load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability;
switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to
get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them
locally.Update 5:Twitter on Scala. A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex
Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners. A fascinating discussion of why
Twitter moved to the Java JVM for their server infrastructure (long lived

<p>Introduction: A lot has been said already about Twitter's scalability issues. Many have
given Twitter as an anti-pattern of how not to deal with scalability and have

<p>Introduction: Update 6:Some interesting changes from Twitter'sEvan Weaver: everything in RAM
now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by
average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page
cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with
Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every
external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to
load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability;
switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to
get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them
locally.Update 5:Twitter on Scala. A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex
Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners. A fascinating discussion of why
Twitter moved to the Java JVM for their server infrastructure (long lived
processes) and why they moved toScalato program against it (high level

<p>Introduction: Unlike Theo Schlossnagle, author ofScalable Internet Architectures, I am not a
stickler for semantics because I have an unswerving faith in the ultimate
unknowability of the world as experienced by others. That's why it is Theo who
bravely tackles the differences in his informative blog postPartitioning vs.
Federation vs. Sharding. Royans Tharakan also talks about it on hisblog.Is
there a difference and does it really matter to all our intrepid scalable
website builders?breakGenerally whatever Theo says is probably close to the
truth. Yet, in my mind I think of partitioning as abasic level categoryand
federation and sharding as more specific (subordinate) instances of
partitioning. And partitioning is a more specific instance of the more more
general (superordinate) category divide-and-conquer. Which isn't a useful way
to think about the topic at all.So, let's say federation is like Star Trek.
The Vulcans, Klingons, and Humans live in very separate policy domains, but

Google Papers, Distributed Filesystems, Non-relational Distributed Databases,
The Lamport Papers, and Implementation Issues. Many old favorites on the list
and some that are likely new to you. My new favorite is "Frangipani: A

<p>Introduction: Can anyone convincingly explain why properties sporting traffic statistics
that may seem in-line with with the capabilities of a single big-iron machine
need so many machines in their architecture?This is a common reaction to
architecture profiles on High Scalability: I could do all that on a few
machines so they must be doing something really stupid. Lo and behold this
same reaction also occurred to the articleThe Architecture Twitter Uses to
Deal with 150M Active Users. On Hacker Newspapsosouid voiced what a lot of
people may have been thinking:I really question the current trend of creating
big, complex, fragile architectures to "be able to scale". These numbers are a
great example of why, the entire thing could run on a single server, in a very
straight forward setup. When you are creating a cluster for scalability, and
it has less CPU, RAM and IO than a single server, what are you gaining? They
are only doing 6k writes a second for crying out loud.This is a surprisingly
hard react</p><p>4 0.86649013 <a title="1491-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-06-7_Not_So_Sexy_Tips_for_Saving_Money_On_Amazon.html">1452 high scalability-2013-05-06-7 Not So Sexy Tips for Saving Money On Amazon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Harish Ganesan CTO of8KMiles has a very helpful blog, Cloud, Big Data and
Mobile, where he shows a nice analytical bent which leads to a lot of
practical advice and cost saving tips:Use SQS Batch Requests to reduce the
number of requests hitting SQS which saves costs. Sending 10 messages in a
single batch request which in the example save $30/month.Use SQS Long Polling
to reduce extra polling requests, cutting down empty receives, which in the
example saves ~$600 in empty receive leakage costs.Choose the right search
technology choice to save costs in AWS by matching your activity pattern to
the technology. For a small application with constant load or a heavily
utilized search tier or seasonal loads Amazon Cloud Search looks like the cost
efficient play. Use Amazon CloudFront Price Class to minimize costs by
selecting the right Price Class for your audience to potentially reduce
delivery costs by excluding Amazon CloudFront's more expensive edge
locations.Optimize ElastiCache Cluster</p><p>5 0.84848624 <a title="1491-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-04-Wide_Fast_SATA%3A_the_Recipe_for_Hot_Performance.html">1511 high scalability-2013-09-04-Wide Fast SATA: the Recipe for Hot Performance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byBrian Bulkowski, CTO and co-founder ofAerospike, a
leading clustered NoSQL database, has worked in the area of high performance
commodity systems since 1989.This blog post will tell you exactly how to build
a multi-terabyte high throughput datacenter server. A fast, reliable multi-
terrabyte data tier can be used for recent behavior (messages, tweets, plays,
actions), or anywhere that today you use Redis or Memcache.You need to
know:Which SSDs workWhich chassis workHow to configure your RAID cardsIntel's
SATA solutions - combined with a high capacity storage server like the Dell
R720xd and a host bus adapter based on the LSI 2208, and a Flash optimized
database likeAerospike, enables high throughput and low latency.In a wide
configuration, with 12 to 20 drives per 2U server, individual servers can
cost-effectively serve at high throughput with 16T at $2.50 per GB with the

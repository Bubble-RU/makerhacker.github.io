<p>Introduction: The world has changed. And some things that should not have been forgotten,
were lost. I found these words from the Lord of the Rings echoing in my head
as I listened to a fascinating presentation by Luiz Andre Barroso,
Distinguished Engineer at Google, concerning Google's legendary past, golden
present, and apocryphal future. His talk, Warehouse-Scale Computing: Entering
the Teenage Decade, was given at theFederated Computing Research Conference.
Luiz clearly knows his stuff and was early at Google, so he has a deep and
penetrating perspective on the technology. There's much to learn from, think
about, and build.Lord of the Rings applies at two levels. At the change level,
Middle Earth went throughthree ages. While listening to Luiz talk, it seems so
has Google: Batch (indexes calculated every month), Warehouse (the datacenter
is the computer), and Instant (make it all real-time). At the "what was
forgot" level, in the Instant Age section of the talk,  a common theme was the

something about it. Doing something about web performance is the job of one
Ilya Grigorik, Developer Advocate,Make the Web Fastat Google, and author of a
great new book:High Performance Browser Networking: What every web developer
should know about networking and web performance. That's a big topic you might
be saying to yourself. And it is. The book is 400 plus information packed
pages. But never fear. Ilya writes in a very straightforward style. It's like
a man page for the web. Which is a good thing.In case you are not familiar
with Ilya, he's the perfect choice for writing such an ambitious book. For
years Ilya has been producing excellent content onhis blog and if yousearch
YouTube you'll find presentation after presentation on the topics found in the
book. Authority established.Reading the book I was struck by what a

<p>Introduction: The RAD Lab (Reliable Adaptive Distributed Systems Laboratory) wants to
leapfrog the Big Switch and create The Next Big Switch, skipping the
cloud/utility evolutionary stage altogether. This hyper-evolutionary niche
buster develops technology so advanced the cloud disperses and you can go back
to building your own personal datacenters again. Where Google took years to
create their datacenters, using a prefab Datacenter Operating System you might
create your own in a long holiday weekend. Not St. Patrick's of course.Their
vision:Enable one person to invent and run the next revolutionary IT service,
operationally expressing a new business idea as a multi-million-user service
over the course of a long weekend. By doing so we hope to enable an Internet
"Fortune 1 million".How? By wizardry in the form of a “datacenter operating
system” created from a pinch of "statistical machine learning (SML)" and a

<p>Introduction: Oh, you don't have a Quantum Computer Lab staffed with researchers? Well,
Google does. Here they areon G+. To learn what they are up to the Verge hasA
first look inside Google's futuristic quantum lab. The lab is partnership
between NASA, Google, and a 512-qubit D-Wave Two quantum computer.  One result
from the lab is:The first practical application has been on Google Glass, as
engineers put the quantum chips to work on Glass's blink detector, helping it
to better distinguish between intentional winks and involuntary blinks. For
engineering reasons, the quantum processor can never be installed in Glass,
but together with Google's conventional server centers, it can point the way
to a better blink-detecting algorithm. That would allow the Glass processor to
detect blinks with better accuracy and using significantly less power. If
successful, it could be an important breakthrough for wink-triggered apps,
which have struggled with the task so far.Google thinksquantum computing has a

<p>Introduction: Algorithms are moving out of the Platonic realm and are becoming dynamic first
class players in real life. We've seen corporations become people. Algorithms
will likely also follow that path to agency.Kevin Slavin in his intriguing TED
talk: How Algorithms Shape Our World, gives many and varied examples of how
algorithms have penetrated RL. One of his most interesting examples is from a
highly technical paper on Relativistic statistical arbitrage, which says to
make money on markets you have to be where the people are, the red dots (on
the diagram below), which means you have to put servers where the blue dots
are, many of which are in the ocean. Here's the diagram from the paper:Mr.
Slavin neatly sums this up by saying:And it's not the money that's so
interesting actually. It's what the money motivates, thatwe're actually
terraforming the Earth itself with this kind of algorithmic efficiency. And in

<p>Introduction: Google has released an epic second edition of their ground breaking The
Datacenter as a Computer book. It's called an introduction, but at 156 pages I
would love to see what the Advanced version would look like!John Fries in aG+
commenthas what I think is a perfect summary of the ultimate sense of the
book:It's funny, when I was at Google I was initially quite intimidated by
interacting with an enormous datacenter, and then I started imagining the
entire datacenter was shrunk down into a small box sitting on my desk, and
realized it was just another machine and the physical size didn't matter
anymoreIt's such a far ranging book that it's impossible to characterize
simply. It covers an amazing diversity of topics, from an introduction to
warehouse-scale computing; workloads and software infrastructure; hardware;
datacenter architecture; energy and power efficiency; cost structures; how to
deal with failures and repairs; and it closes with a discussion of key
challenges, which include ra</p><p>2 0.92265427 <a title="1505-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-17-Ringo_-_Distributed_key-value_storage_for_immutable_data.html">468 high scalability-2008-12-17-Ringo - Distributed key-value storage for immutable data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ringo is an experimental, distributed, replicating key-value store based on
consistent hashing and immutable data. Unlike many general-purpose databases,
Ringo is designed for a specific use case: For archiving small (less than 4KB)
or medium-size data items (<100MB) in real-time so that the data can survive K
- 1 disk breaks, where K is the desired number of replicas, without any
downtime, in a manner that scales to terabytes of data. In addition to
storing, Ringo should be able to retrieve individual or small sets of data
items with low latencies (<10ms) and provide a convenient on-disk format for
bulk data access.Ringo is compatible with themap-reduce framework Discoand it
was started atNokia Research CenterPalo Alto.</p><p>3 0.87918562 <a title="1505-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-24-Habits_of_Highly_Scalable_Web_Applications_.html">637 high scalability-2009-06-24-Habits of Highly Scalable Web Applications </a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you are Google you don't just complain about performance on the web, you do
something about it. Doing something about web performance is the job of one
Ilya Grigorik, Developer Advocate,Make the Web Fastat Google, and author of a
great new book:High Performance Browser Networking: What every web developer
should know about networking and web performance. That's a big topic you might
be saying to yourself. And it is. The book is 400 plus information packed
pages. But never fear. Ilya writes in a very straightforward style. It's like
a man page for the web. Which is a good thing.In case you are not familiar
with Ilya, he's the perfect choice for writing such an ambitious book. For
years Ilya has been producing excellent content onhis blog and if yousearch
YouTube you'll find presentation after presentation on the topics found in the
book. Authority established.Reading the book I was struck by what a
complicated beast or little World Wide Web has become. That's clear from just

<p>Introduction: There has been an update on Pinterest: Pinterest growth driven by Amazon cloud
scalability since our last post: A Short on the Pinterest Stack for Handling
3+ Million Users.With Pinterest we see a story very similar to that
ofInstagram. Huge growth, lots of users, lots of data, with remarkably few
employees, all on the cloud.While it's true that both Pinterest and Instagram
are not making great advances inscience and technology, that is more indicator
of the easy power of today's commodity environments rather than a sign of
Silicon Valley's lack of innovation. The numbers are so huge and the
valuations are so high we naturally want some sort of fundamental
technological revolution to underlie their growth. The revolution is more
subtle. It really is just that easy to attain such growth these days, if you
can execute on the right idea. Get used to it. This is the new normal.Here's
what Pinterest looks like today: 80 million objects stored in S3 with 410

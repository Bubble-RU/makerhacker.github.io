<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byBrian Bulkowski, CTO and co-founder ofAerospike, a
leading clustered NoSQL database, has worked in the area of high performance
commodity systems since 1989.This blog post will tell you exactly how to build
a multi-terabyte high throughput datacenter server. A fast, reliable multi-
terrabyte data tier can be used for recent behavior (messages, tweets, plays,
actions), or anywhere that today you use Redis or Memcache.You need to
know:Which SSDs workWhich chassis workHow to configure your RAID cardsIntel's
SATA solutions - combined with a high capacity storage server like the Dell
R720xd and a host bus adapter based on the LSI 2208, and a Flash optimized
database likeAerospike, enables high throughput and low latency.In a wide
configuration, with 12 to 20 drives per 2U server, individual servers can
cost-effectively serve at high throughput with 16T at $2.50 per GB with the
s3700, or $1.25 with the s3500. Other SSD offerings - from Crucial (Micron)

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byBrian Bulkowski, CTO and co-founder ofAerospike, a
leading clustered NoSQL database, has worked in the area of high performance
commodity systems since 1989.Why flash rules for databasesThe economics of
flash memory are staggering.If you're not using SSD, you are doing it wrong.
Not quite true, but close. Some small applications fit entirely in memory -
less than 100GB - great for in-memory solutions. There's a place for
rotational drives (HDD) in massive streaming analytics and petabytes of data.
But for the vast space between, flash has become the only sensible option. For
example, the Samsung 840 costs $180 for 250GB. The speed rating for this drive
is rated by the manufacturer at 96,000 random 4K read IOPS, and 61,000 random
4K write IOPS. The Samsung 840 is not alone at this price performance. A 300GB
Intel 320 is $450. An OCZ Vertex 4 256GB is $235, with the Intel being rated
as slowest, but our internal testing showing solid performance. Most

<p>Introduction: Imagine if you will that car rental agencies rented cars like programmers are
hired at many software companies...Agency: So sorry you had to wait in the
reception area for an hour. Nobody knew you were coming to today. I finally
found 8 people to interview before we can rent you a car. If we like you you
may have to come in for another round of interviews tomorrow because our
manager isn't in today. I didn't have a chance to read your application, so
I'll just start with a question. What car do you drive today?Applicant: I
drive a 2008 Subaru.Agency: That's a shame. We don't have a Subaru to rent
you.Applicant: That's OK. Any car will do.Agency: No, we can only take on
clients who know how to drive the cars we stock. We find it's safer that way.
There are so many little differences between cars, we just don't want to take
a chance.Applicant: I have a drivers license. I know how to drive. I've been
driving all kinds of cars for 15 years, I am sure I can adapt. Agency: We

<p>Introduction: What have bunch of applications which run on Debian servers, which processes
huge amount of data stored in a shared NFS drive.we have 3 applications
working as a pipeline, which process data stored in the NFS drive. The first
application processes the data and store the output in some folder in the NFS
drive, the second app in the pipeline process the data from the previous step
and so on.The data load to the pipeline is like 1 GBytes per minute. I think
the NFS drive is the bottleneck here.Would buying a specialized file server

<p>Introduction: Planning your next buildout and thinking SSDs are still far in the future?
Still too expensive, too low density. Hard disks are cheap, familiar, and
store lots of stuff. In this short and entertaining video Wikia's Artur
Bergmanwants to change your mind about SSDs. SSDs are for today, get with the
math already.Here's Artur's logic:Wikia is all SSD in production. The new
Wikia file servers have a theoretical read rate of ~10GB/sec sequential,
6GB/sec random and 1.2 million IOPs. If you can't do math or love the past,
you love spinning rust. If you are awesome you love SSDs.SSDs are cheaper than
drives using the most relevant metric: $/GB/IOPS. 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS and one
hard drive is 180 IOPS. Need 1 SSD instead of 50 hard drives.With 8 million
files there's a 9 minute fsck. Full backup in 12 minutes (X-25M based).4

<p>Introduction: "It's all a numbers game - the dirty little secret of scalable systems"Martin
Thompsonis a High Performance Computing Specialist with a real mission to
teach programmers how to understand the innards of modern computing systems.
He has many talks and classes (listed below) on caches, buffers, memory
controllers, processor architectures, cache lines, etc.His thought is
programmers do not put a proper value on understanding how the underpinnings
of our systems work. We gravitate to the shiny and trendy. His approach is not
to teach people specific programming strategies, but to teach programmers to
fish so they can feed themselves. Without a real understanding strategies are
easy to apply wrongly.  It's strange how programmers will put a lot of effort
into understanding complicated frameworks like Hibernate, but little effort
into understanding the underlying hardware on which their programs run.A major
tenant of Martin's approach is to "lead by experimental observation rather
than what</p><p>4 0.67589957 <a title="1384-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-22-Kevin%27s_Great_Adventures_in_SSDland.html">257 high scalability-2008-02-22-Kevin's Great Adventures in SSDland</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:Final Thoughts on SSD and MySQL AKA Battleship Spinn3r. Tips on how to
make your database 10x faster using solid state drives. Potential exists for
100x speedup.Solid-state drives(SSDs) are the holy grail of storage. The
promise of RAM speeds and hard disk like persistence have for years driven us
crazy with power user lust, but they've stayed tantalizingly just out of
reach. Always too expensive, too small, and oddly too slow. Has that changed?
Can you now miraculously have your cake and eat it too? Can you now have it
both ways? Is balancing work with family life now as easy as tripping over a
terabyte drive?In a pioneering series of blog articles Kevin Burton conducts
original research on next generation SSD drives in real world configurations.

<p>Introduction: Atif Ghaffarhas a nice strategy to deal with virus checking uploads:Upload
item into a safe area. If necessary, the uploader blocks waiting for a
result.Queue a work order into a job system so all the work can be distributed
throughout your cluster.A service in your cluster performs the virus scan and
informs the uploader of the result.Move the vetted item into your system.This
removes the CPU bottleneck from your web servers and distributes it through
your cluster. Keep your web servers providing prompt service to users. Let
your cluster do the heavy lifting. This minimizes response time and maximizes
throughput. A similar system can be used for creating thumbnails, transcoding,
copyright checks, updating indexes, event notification or any other kind of
intensive work.</p><p>2 0.8466258 <a title="1384-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-06-DyradLINQ.html">592 high scalability-2009-05-06-DyradLINQ</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We usually think of the wonderful advantages of service oriented

Now 385, that Doyen of Disk,Steve Gibson, tells the fascinating story (@ about
41:30) of how moving to a service oriented architecture in hard drives,
modeling a drive as a linear stream of sectors, helped create the amazing high
density disk drives we enjoy today.When drives switched to use
theIDE(integrated drive electronics) interface, the controller function moved
into the drive instead of the computer. No longer were low level drive signals
moved across cables and into the motherboard. Now we just ask the drive for
the desired sector and the drive takes care of it.This allowed manufacturers
to do anything they wanted to behind the IDE interface. The drive stopped
being dumb, it became smart, providing a sort of sector service. Density sky
rocketed because there was no dependency on the computer. All the internals
could completely change as</p><p>4 0.75591123 <a title="1384-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-25-Colmux_-_Finding_Memory_Leaks%2C_High_I-O_Wait_Times%2C_and_Hotness_on_3000_Node_Clusters.html">1104 high scalability-2011-08-25-Colmux - Finding Memory Leaks, High I-O Wait Times, and Hotness on 3000 Node Clusters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Todd had originally posted an entry oncollectlhere atCollectl - Performance
Data Collector. Collectl collects real-time data from a large number of
subsystems like buddyinfo, cpu, disk, inodes, infiniband, lustre, memory,
network, nfs, processes, quadrics, slabs, sockets and tcp, all using one tool
and in one consistent format.Since then a lot has happened.  It's now part of
both Fedora and Debian distros, not to mention several others. There has also
been a pretty good summary written up byJoe Brockmeier. It's also pretty well
documented (I like to think) onsourceforge. There have also been a few blog
postings by Martin Bachon his blog.Anyhow, awhile back I released a new
version of collectl-utils and gave a complete face-lift to one of the
utilities, colmux, which is a collectl multiplexor.  This tool has the ability
to run collectl on multiple systems, which in turn send all their output back
to colmux.  Colmux then sorts the output on a user-specified column and
reports the 'top-n'</p><p>5 0.74966288 <a title="1384-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-28-Strategy%3A_Guaranteed_Availability_Requires_Reserving_Instances_in_Specific_Zones.html">1165 high scalability-2011-12-28-Strategy: Guaranteed Availability Requires Reserving Instances in Specific Zones</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When EC2 first started the mental model was of a magic Pez dispenser supplying
an infinite stream of instances in any desired flavor. If you needed an
instance, because of a either a failure or traffic spike, it would be there.
As amazing as EC2 is, this model turned out to be optimistic.  From athread on
the Amazon discussion forum we learn any dispenser has limits:As Availability
Zones grow over time, our ability to continue to expand them can become
constrained. In these scenarios, we will prevent customers from launching in
the constrained zone if they do not yet have existing resources in that zone.
We also might remove the constrained zone entirely from the list of options
for new customers. This means that occasionally, different customers will see
a different number of Availability Zones in a particular Region. Both
approaches aim to help customers avoid accidentally starting to build up their
infrastructure in an Availability Zone where they might have less ability to
expand.T</p><p>6 0.70545793 <a title="1384-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-03-Leslie_Lamport_to_Programmers%3A_You%27re_Doing_it_Wrong.html">1625 high scalability-2014-04-03-Leslie Lamport to Programmers: You're Doing it Wrong</a></p>

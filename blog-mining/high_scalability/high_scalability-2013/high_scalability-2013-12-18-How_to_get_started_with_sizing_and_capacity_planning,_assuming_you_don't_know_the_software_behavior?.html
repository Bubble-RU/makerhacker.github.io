Start with requirements. I see way too many "capacity planning" exercises that go off spending weeks measuring some irrelevant metrics about a system (like how many widgets per hour can this thing do) without knowing what they actually need it to do.


There are two key sets of metrics to state here: the "how much" set and the "how bad" set:

</p><p>5 (Don't get too greedy and ask for "perfect" here, or you'll get a big bill at the end. [sent-9, score-0.094]

<p>Introduction: Update 3:   The book was released! Find it on Amazon at   The Art of Capacity Planning  .    Update 2:   Maybe the iPhone can use a little capacity planning?   What's Behind the iPhone 3G Glitches  :   One source says Apple programmed the Infineon chip to demand a more powerful 3G signal than the iPhone really requires. So if too many people try to make a call or go on the Internet in a given area, some of the devices will decide there's insufficient power and switch to the slower networkâ&euro;&rdquo;even if there is enough 3G bandwidth available.      Update:   To get a taste of what will be served,   mySQL DBA    has a nice post titled   Capacity Planning, Architecture, Scaling, Response time, Throughput  . You learn how to figure out when your application will break by building a 3rd order polynomial.  Cool stuff!

<p>Introduction: In the era of Web 2.0 traditional approaches to capacity planning are often difficult to implement. Guerrilla Capacity Planning facilitates rapid forecasting of capacity requirements based on the opportunistic use of whatever performance data and tools are available.  One unique Guerrilla tool is Virtual Load Testing, based on Dr. Gunther's "Universal Law of Computational Scaling", which provides a highly cost-effective method for assessing application scalability. Neil Gunther, M.Sc., Ph.D. is an internationally recognized computer system performance consultant who founded Performance Dynamics Company in 1994.  Some reasons why you should understand this law:   1. A lot of people use the term "scalability" without clearly defining it, let alone defining it quantitatively. Computer system scalability must be quantified. If you can't quantify it, you can't guarantee it. The universal law of computational scaling provides that quantification.   2. One the greatest impediments to applying</p><p>5 0.11312902 <a title="1566-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-23-Averages%2C_web_performance_data%2C_and_how_your_analytics_product_is_lying_to_you__.html">1250 high scalability-2012-05-23-Averages, web performance data, and how your analytics product is lying to you  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: This guest post is written by  Josh Fraser , co-founder and CEO of  Torbit .  Torbit creates tools for measuring, analyzing and optimizing web performance. Â  
 
Did you know that 5% of the pageviews on Walmart.com take over 20 seconds to load? Walmart discovered this recently after adding real user measurement (RUM) to analyze their web performance for every single visitor to their site. Walmart used JavaScript to measure their median load time as well as key metrics like their 95th percentile. While 20 seconds is a long time to wait for a website to load,  the Walmart story  is actually not that uncommon. Remember, this is the worst 5% of their pageviews, not the typical experience.
 
Walmart's median load time was reported at around 4 seconds, meaning half of their visitors loaded Walmart.com faster than 4 seconds and the other half took longer than 4 seconds to load. Using this knowledge, Walmart was prepared to act. By reducing page load times by even one second, Walmart found that</p><p>6 0.10764129 <a title="1566-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-04-How_MySpace_Tested_Their_Live_Site_with_1_Million_Concurrent_Users.html">788 high scalability-2010-03-04-How MySpace Tested Their Live Site with 1 Million Concurrent Users</a></p>

 Quotable Quotes:                            
 
  @GammaCounter : "There are 400 billion trees in the Amazon River basin, close to the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy."  
  @rbranson : Virtualization has near-zero overhead, unless the VM spends most of it's time copying between RAM and network… like memcached or haproxy. 
  @HackerNewsOnion : Programming is 1% inspiration, 99% trying to get your environment working. 
  @aneel : "roundtrips, not bandwidth, is now often the bottleneck for most applications"

<p>Introduction: Update:   Arjen  links to video  Supporting Scalable Online Statistical Processing  which shows "rather than doing complete aggregates, use statistical sampling to provide a reasonable estimate (unbiased guess) of the result."  When you have a lot of data,  sampling  allows you to draw conclusions from a much smaller amount of data. That's why sampling is a scalability solution. If you don't have to process all your data to get the information you need then you've made the problem smaller and you'll need fewer resources and you'll get more timely results.
   
 Sampling is not useful when you need a complete list that matches a specific criteria. If you need to know the exact set of people who bought a car in the last week then sampling won't help.  But, if you want to know many people bought a car then you could take a sample and then create estimate of the full data-set. The difference is you won't really know the exact car count. You'll have a confidence interval saying how confident</p><p>6 0.73971236 <a title="1566-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-08-Guerrilla_Capacity_Planning_and_the_Law_of_Universal_Scalability.html">381 high scalability-2008-09-08-Guerrilla Capacity Planning and the Law of Universal Scalability</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A lot of sites hosted in San Francisco are down because of at least 6 back-to-back power outages power outages. More details at  laughingsquid .
   
Sites like SecondLife, Craigstlist, Technorati, Yelp and all Six Apart properties, TypePad, LiveJournal and Vox are all down. The cause was an underground explosion in a transformer vault under a manhole at 560 Mission Street. Flames shot 6 feet out from the manhole cover. Over PG&E; 30,000 customers are without power.  What's perplexing is the UPS backup and diesel generators didn't kick in to bring the datacenter back on line. I've never toured that datacenter, but they usually have massive backup systems. It's probably one of those multiple simultaneous failure situations that you hope never happen in real life, but too often do. Or maybe the infrastructure wasn't rolled out completely.  Update: the cause was a cascade of failures in a tightly couples system that could never happen :-) Details at  Failure Happens: A summary of the power</p><p>same-blog 2 0.91857034 <a title="1566-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-18-How_to_get_started_with_sizing_and_capacity_planning%2C_assuming_you_don%27t_know_the_software_behavior%3F.html">1566 high scalability-2013-12-18-How to get started with sizing and capacity planning, assuming you don't know the software behavior?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here's a common situation and question from the  mechanical-sympathy  Google group by Avinash Agrawal on the black art of capacity planning:
  

How to get started with sizing and capacity planning, assuming we don't know the software behavior and its completely new product to deal with?

  
 Gil Tene , Vice President of Technology and CTO & Co-Founder, wrote a very  understandable and useful answer  that is worth highlighting:
  

Start with requirements. I see way too many "capacity planning" exercises that go off spending weeks measuring some irrelevant metrics about a system (like how many widgets per hour can this thing do) without knowing what they actually need it to do.


There are two key sets of metrics to state here: the "how much" set and the "how bad" set:


In the "How Much" part, you need to establish, based on expected business needs, Numbers for things (like connections, users, streams, transactions or messages per second) that you expect to interact with at the peak t</p><p>3 0.91222882 <a title="1566-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-19-Strategy%3A_Three_Techniques_to_Survive_Traffic_Surges_by_Quickly_Scaling_Your_Site.html">1615 high scalability-2014-03-19-Strategy: Three Techniques to Survive Traffic Surges by Quickly Scaling Your Site</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matthew Might , as a first responder to a surprise  traffic surge  on his inexpensive linode hosted blog, took emergency steps that you might find useful in a similar situation:
  
  Find the bottleneck.  Reloading the page in firebug showed the first page took 24 seconds to load and after that everything else loaded quickly. In retrospect this burst meant the site was thread limited as the CPU was idle. 
  Cut image sizes in half  with a shell script using ImageMagick's convert. Load time is now 12 seconds. 
  Turn dynamic content into static content  using a static index.html file  copied using the browser's "view source" feature. Load time is now 6 seconds. 
  Added threads  to the Apache configuration file. Load time is now 2 seconds. Crises averted. 
  
Because of this quick thinking and quick action the patient survived to serve pages another day.
 
And in fine post-mortem tradition some of the future changes are:

<p>Introduction: Sify.com is one of the leading portals in India. Samachar.com is owned by the same company and is one of the top content aggregation sites in India, primarily targeting Non-resident Indians from around the world. Ramki Subramanian, an Architect at Sify, has been generous enough to describe the common back-end for both these sites. One of the most notable aspects of their architecture is that Sify does not use a traditional database. They query Solr and then retrieve records from a distributed file system. Over the years many people have argued for file systems over databases. Filesystems can work for key-value lookups, but they don't work for queries, using Solr is a good way around that problem. Another interesting aspect of their system is the use of Drools for intelligent cache invalidation. As we have more and more data duplicated in multiple specialized services, the problem of how to keep them  synchronized  is a difficult one. A rules engine is a clever approach.

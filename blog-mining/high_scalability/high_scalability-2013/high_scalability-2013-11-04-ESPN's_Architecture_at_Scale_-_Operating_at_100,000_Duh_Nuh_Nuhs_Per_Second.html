</p><p>3 From an initial 30 minute program reviewing the day's sports, they went on to make deals with the NBA,USFL, NHL, and what would become the big fish of all sports in the US, the National Football League. [sent-20, score-0.33]
</p><p>4 Sport by sport deals were made to bring sports data in from all possible sources so ESPN could report scores, play film clips, and generally become one stop shopping for all things sports on TV and later the web. [sent-21, score-0.845]
</p><p>5 They have a lot going on with Television & Broadcasting, live scoring, editing and publishing, Digital Media, giving sports scores, web and mobile, personalization, fantasy games, and they also want to expand API access to 3rd party developers. [sent-23, score-0.451]
</p><p>6 ESPN wants to become a walled garden built on a sports content platform that centralizes access to their prime advantage over everyone else, which is unprecedented access to sports related content and data. [sent-32, score-0.95]
</p><p>7 That individual sports like the NFL and MLB seeking to capture this value with their own network lessens this advantage somewhat, but the forces are such that everyone needs to get along, which puts ESPN in the middle of a powerful platform play, if they can execute. [sent-56, score-0.33]

<p>Introduction: Ten million players a day and over fifty million players a month interact
socially with friends usingPlayfishgames on social platforms like The
Facebook, MySpace, and the iPhone. Playfish was an early innovator in the
fastest growing segment of the game industry:social gaming, which is the love
child between casual gaming and social networking. Playfish was also an early
adopter of the Amazon cloud, running their system entirely on 100s of cloud
servers. Playfish finds itself at the nexus of some hot trends (which may by
why EA bought them for$300 millionand they think a$1 billion gameis possible):
building games on social networks, build applications in the cloud, mobile
gaming, leveraging data driven design to continuously evolve and improve
systems, agile development and deployment, andselling virtual goodas a

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Jamie Hall, Co-founder & CTO ofMocoSpace, describing
the architecture for their mobile social network. This is a timely
architecture to learn from as it combines several hot trends: it is very
large, mobile, and social. What they think is especially cool about their
system is: how it optimizes for device/browser fragmentation on the mobile
Web; their multi-tiered, read/write, local/distributed caching system;
selecting PostgreSQL over MySQL as a relational DB that can scale.MocoSpace is
a mobile social network, with 12 million members and 3 billion page views a
month, which makes it one of the most highly trafficked mobile Websites in the
US. Members access the site mainly from their mobile phone Web browser,
ranging from high end smartphones to lower end devices, as well as the Web.
Activities on the site include customizing profiles, chat, instant messaging,
music, sharing photos & videos, games, eCards and blogs. The monetization
strategy is focused on advert</p><p>5 0.14936523 <a title="1542-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-07-Startups_are_Creating_a_New_System_of_the_World_for_IT.html">1240 high scalability-2012-05-07-Startups are Creating a New System of the World for IT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: Update: More background by Ikai Lan, who worked on the mobile server team at
LinkedIn, sayssome facts were left out: the app made "a cross data center
request, guys. Running on single-threaded Rails servers (every request blocked
the entire process), running Mongrel, leaking memory like a sieve." Which
explains why any non-blocking approach would be a win. And Ikai, I hope as you
do that nobody reads HS and just does what somebody else does without
thinking. The goal here is information that you can use to make your own
decisions. Ryan Paul has written an excellent behind-the-scenes look at
LinkedIn's mobile engineering. While the mobile part of the story--23% mobile
usage; focus on simplicity, ease of use, and reliability; using a room
metaphor; 30% native, 80% HTML; embedded lightweight HTTP server; single
client-app connection--could help guide your mobile strategy, the backend
effects of moving from Rails to Node.js may also prove interesting. After

architecture to learn from as it combines several hot trends: it is very
large, mobile, and social. What they think is especially cool about their
system is: how it optimizes for device/browser fragmentation on the mobile
Web; their multi-tiered, read/write, local/distributed caching system;
selecting PostgreSQL over MySQL as a relational DB that can scale.MocoSpace is
a mobile social network, with 12 million members and 3 billion page views a
month, which makes it one of the most highly trafficked mobile Websites in the
US. Members access the site mainly from their mobile phone Web browser,
ranging from high end smartphones to lower end devices, as well as the Web.
Activities on the site include customizing profiles, chat, instant messaging,
music, sharing photos & videos, games, eCards and blogs. The monetization
strategy is focused on advert</p><p>5 0.80656415 <a title="1542-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-27-Notify.me_Architecture_-_Synchronicity_Kills.html">431 high scalability-2008-10-27-Notify.me Architecture - Synchronicity Kills</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What's cool about starting a new project is you finally have a chance to do it
right. You of course eventually mess everything up in your own way, but for
that one moment the world has a perfect order, a rightness that feels
satisfying and good. Arne Claassen, the CTO of notify.me, a brand new real
time notification delivery service, is in this honeymoon period now.Arne has
been gracious enough to share with us his philosophy of how to build a
notification service. I think you'll find it fascinating because Arne goes
into a lot of useful detail about how his system works.His main design
philosophy is to minimize the bottlenecks that form around synchronous access,
that is whensome resource is requested and the requestor ties up more
resources, waiting for a response. If the requested resource can't be
delivered in a timely manner, more and more requests pile up until the server
can't accept any new ones. Nobody gets what they want and you have an outage.

<p>Introduction: Does anyone have any advice or suggestions on how to store millions of images?
Currently images are stored in a MS SQL database which performance wise isn't
ideal. We'd like to migrate the images over to a file system structure but I'd
assume we don't just want to dump millions of images into a single directory.
Besides having to contend with naming collisions, the windows filesystem might
not perform optimally with that many files.I'm assuming one approach may be to
assign each user a unique CSLID, create a folder based on the CSLID and then
place one users files in that particular folder. Even so, this could result in
hundreds of thousands of folders. Whats the best organizational
scheme/heirachy for doing this?</p><p>2 0.93540269 <a title="1542-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-21-Using_Google_AppEngine_for_a_Little_Micro-Scalability.html">307 high scalability-2008-04-21-Using Google AppEngine for a Little Micro-Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Over the years I've accumulated quite a rag tag collection of personal systems
scattered wide across a galaxy of different servers. For the past month I've
been on a quest to rationalize this conglomeration by moving everything to a
managed service of one kind or another. The goal: lift a load of worry from my
mind. I like to do my own stuff my self so I learn something and have control.
Control always comes with headaches and it was time for a little aspirin. As
part of the process GAE came in handy as a host for a few Twitter related
scripts I couldn't manage to run anywhere else. I recoded my simple little
scripts into Python/GAE and learned a lot in the process.breakIn the move I
exported HighScalability from a VPS and imported it into a shared hosting
service. I could never quite configure Apache and MySQL well enough that they
wouldn't spike memory periodically and crash the VPS. And since a memory crash
did not automatically restarted it was unacceptable. I also wrote a script t</p><p>3 0.93239695 <a title="1542-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-16-Do_you_have_any_questions_for_the_Elastra_CEO%3F.html">277 high scalability-2008-03-16-Do you have any questions for the Elastra CEO?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It looks like in the near future I'll have a chance to interview the Elastra
CEO. Elastra provides standarddatabases--MySQL, EnterpriseDB and PostgreSQL--
on top of EC2 and S3. They are selling aggressive pricing, expandable and
contactable database resource usage in response to demand, and a simple
management and operations interface to well known databases deployed in a
cloud. Elastra could be an important option for developers looking for a more
traditional cloudy database.I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions
for questions you would like answered? What would you like to know about their
service? What are you looking for in a cloudy database? What would stop you
from adopting it or what would make you decide to adopt it? Any ideas you have
would help a lot and will probably be better than anything I have.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.92320198 <a title="1542-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-04-ESPN%27s_Architecture_at_Scale_-_Operating_at_100%2C000_Duh_Nuh_Nuhs_Per_Second.html">1542 high scalability-2013-11-04-ESPN's Architecture at Scale - Operating at 100,000 Duh Nuh Nuhs Per Second</a></p>
<p>Introduction: ESPN went on airin 1978. In those 30+ years think of the wonders we've seen!
When I think of ESPN I think of a world wide brand that is the very definition
of prime time. And it shows in their stats. ESPN.com peaks at 100,000 requests
per second. Their peak event is, not surprisingly, the World Cup. But would
you be surprised to learn ESPN is powered by only a few hundred servers and a
couple of dozen engineers? I was.And would you be surprised to learn ESPN is
undergoing a fundamental transition from an Enterprise architecture to one
capable of handling web scale loads driven by increasing mobile usage,
personalization, and a service orientation? Again, thinking ESPN was just
about watching sports on TV, I was surprised. ESPN is becoming much more than
that. ESPN is becoming a sports platform. How does ESPN handle all of this
complexity, responsibility, change, and load? Unlike most every other profile
on HighScalability. The fascinating story of ESPN's architecture is told

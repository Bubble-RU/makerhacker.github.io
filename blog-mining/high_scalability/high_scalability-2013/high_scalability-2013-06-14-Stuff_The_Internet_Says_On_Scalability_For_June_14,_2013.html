<p>Introduction: The paper  MegaPipe: A New Programming Interface for Scalable Network I/O  ( video ,  slides ) hits the common theme that if you want to go faster you need a better car design, not just a better driver. So that's why the authors started with a clean-slate and designed a network API from the ground up with support for concurrent I/O, a requirement for achieving high performance while scaling to large numbers of connections per thread, multiple cores, etc.  What they created is MegaPipe, "a new network programming API for message-oriented workloads to avoid the performance issues of BSD Socket API."
 
The result: MegaPipe outperforms baseline Linux between  29% (for long connections)  and  582% (for short connections) . MegaPipe improves the performance of a modiﬁed version of  memcached between 15% and 320% . For a workload based on real-world HTTP traces, MegaPipe boosts the throughput of  nginx by 75% .

<p>Introduction: On the surface nothing appears more different than soft data and hard raw materials like iron. Then isn’t it  ironic , in the  Alanis Morissette  sense,  that in this Age of Information, great wealth still lies hidden deep beneath piles of stuff?  It's so strange how directly digging for dollars in data parallels the great wealth producing models of the Industrial Revolution.
 
The piles of stuff is the Internet. It takes lots of prospecting to find the right stuff. Mighty web crawling machines tirelessly collect stuff, bringing it into their huge maws, then depositing load after load into rack after rack of distributed file system machines. Then armies of still other machines take this stuff and strip out the valuable raw materials, which in the Information Age, are endless bytes of raw data. Link clicks, likes, page views, content, head lines, searches, inbound links, outbound links, search clicks, hashtags, friends, purchases: anything and everything you do on the Internet is a valu</p><p>6 0.1274803 <a title="1476-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-20-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_September_20%2C_2013.html">1520 high scalability-2013-09-20-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For September 20, 2013</a></p>

  @OttmarAmann  : Scalability is not as important as managing complexity  
  @amankapur91  : Does scalability imply standardization, and then does standardization imply loss of innovation? 
 
 
 Spotify uses a P2P architecture and this paper,  Spotify – Large Scale, Low Latency, P2P Music-on-Demand Streaming , describes it. 
  The Faving spam counter-measures . Ironically, deviantART relates a gripping story of how they detected and stopped a deviant user from attacking their servers with an automated faving script which faved every 10 seconds for 24 hours a day. The same spam filter they use on the rest of the site was used. Problem solved. Would like detail on their spam filter though.

 Who am I? I have 50 petabytes of data stored in Hadoop and Teradata, 400 million items for sale, 250 million queries a day, 100,000 pages served per second, 112 million active users, $75 billions sold in 2012...If you  guessed eBay  then you've won the auction.

   Controlled Experiments at Large Scale : Bing found that every 100ms faster they deliver search result pages yields 0.6% more in revenue  
  Luis Bettencourt : A city is first and foremost a social reactor. It works like a star, attracting people and accelerating social interaction and social outputs in a way that is analogous to how stars compress matter and burn brighter and faster the bigger they are. 
  @nntaleb : unless you understand that fat tails come from concentration of errors, you should not discuss probability & risk

  Mining Experiment: Running 600 Servers for a Year Yields 0.4 Bitcoin . Yes, this is a far superior way of doing things. Chew up the commons for marginal gain. It's like old times. 
  Game designers, forget the sardines and go hunt some whale .  Swrve found : half of free-to-play games’ in-app purchases came from 0.15 percent of players. Only 1.5 percent of players of games in the Swrve network spent any money at all.

<p>Introduction: An Analysis of Linux Scalability to Many Cores , by a number of MIT researchers, is a refreshingly practical paper on what it takes to scale Linux and common applications like Exim, memcached, Apache, PostgreSQL, gmake, Psearchy, and MapReduce to run on 48 core systems. A very timely paper given moderately massive multicore systems are reportedly the near future of computing.
 
This paper must have taken a lot of work. They both tracked down bottlenecks in a number of applications and the Linux kernel and they also tried to fix them. Modestly speaking the authors said they made "modest" changes to the kernel and applications, but there's nothing modest about what they did. It's excellent work.
 
After the next bit, which is the abstract, there is a list of the problems they found and how they fixed them.

You have to have complete fluidity with the storage tier, the web tier. We are running our own data centers. We are looking more at doing our own data centers with more of a private cloud.

<p>Introduction: Hello all,     does anyone have experience in scaling a european website to china?     The main problem in china is the internet connectivity to websites outside china, that means latency and packetloss (and perhaps filtering) make things difficult.     The options I see are:     1. Host you application in china, but where? I haven't got a answer from any chinese ISP I contacted. On the other hand I don't really want to host in china.     2. Build your own CDN. Wikipedia shows how it goes. Get a bunch of machines (but where? see point 1) put squid on them, implement intelligent cache invalidation and you're set. But where can I get machines in china? Where do I need them in china? There are soe big isps with limited peering capability, so I'd need servers in every network.     3. Get professional CDN services. Akamai, ChinaCache, CDNetworks, etc etc.. They all provide services in china. The problem is: they are all very expensive.     4. Amazon EC2/S3 ? Is it worth thinking about this</p><p>5 0.89541531 <a title="1476-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-03-GOV.UK_-_Not_Your_Father%27s_Stack.html">1469 high scalability-2013-06-03-GOV.UK - Not Your Father's Stack</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I'm not sure what I was expecting the stack  GOV.UK used at launch  to look like. Maybe some messenger owls and lots of cobwebs? But not so at all. So much not so I thought any organization looking at their own stack for ideas could learn something from the considered choices of others.
 
The diversity of technologies used was surprising. They use "at least five different programming languages, three separate database types, two versions of an operating system." Some may think of this as a weakness, but they think it a strength:
  

The reason we operate such a diverse ecosystem is that we are focused on solving real problems. Our first task is to understand the problem or need we are solving and then to choose the best tool for the job. If we restrict ourselves to moulding the need to the tools we already have, then we risk not solving the initial problem in the best way possible for the user. By restricting software diversity or enforcing rigid organisational standards on a project,</p><p>6 0.89255285 <a title="1476-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-27-Amazon_Announces_Static_IP_Addresses_and_Multiple_Datacenter_Operation.html">289 high scalability-2008-03-27-Amazon Announces Static IP Addresses and Multiple Datacenter Operation</a></p>

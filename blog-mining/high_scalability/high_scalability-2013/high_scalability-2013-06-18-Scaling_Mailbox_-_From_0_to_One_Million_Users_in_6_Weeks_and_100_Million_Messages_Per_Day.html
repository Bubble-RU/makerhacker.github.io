<p>Introduction: Perditionis a fully featured POP3 and IMAP4 proxy server. It is able to handle
both SSL and non-SSL connections and redirect users to a real-server based on
a database lookup. Perdition supports modular based database access. ODBC,
MySQL, PostgreSQL, GDBM, POSIX Regular Expression and NIS modules ship with
the distribution. The API for modules is open allowing arbitrary modules to be
written to allow access to any data store.Perdition has many uses. Including,
creating large mail systems where an end-user's mailbox may be stored on one
of several hosts, integrating different mail systems together, migrating
between different email infrastructures, and bridging plain-text, SSL and TLS
services. It can also be used as part of a firewall. The use of perditon to
scale mail services beyond a single box is discussed in high capacity email.</p><p>3 0.15951775 <a title="1477-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-13-In_Memoriam%3A_Lavabit_Architecture_-_Creating_a_Scalable_Email_Service.html">1501 high scalability-2013-08-13-In Memoriam: Lavabit Architecture - Creating a Scalable Email Service</a></p>

for?Lavabit is a mid-sized email service provider. We currently have about
140,000 registered users with more than 260,000 email addresses. While most of
our accounts belong to individual users, we also provide corporate email
services to approximately 70 companies.Why did you decide to build this

<p>Introduction: Recently I had to help users on one of my opensource project ISPMan.
http://ispman.netThis project started in 2001 as I was too unwilling to take
care of the DNS and VitualHosting stuff as it was a side-thing to the company
I worked for (so i wrote a software that took care of all these little
details)Summary: A large project that needs a rewrite can be done in a matter
of day.I will not give you a full case study about a project that went through
a re-write but a case study about how easy it is to re-write
something.breakDetails:My boss was cool enough to let me open-source the
project and obviously, I got a lot of cool-cred out of it.Later on I also did
some support and implementation and earned quiet some money with it.Eventually
I had to let the project go out of my hand to the community as I only did it
to facilitate a job that wasnt williing to do. (Setup DNS zones of multiple
servers, find out which host should host the website and put VirtualHost
section there, find out which m</p><p>5 0.12902343 <a title="1477-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-24-Mailinator_Architecture.html">221 high scalability-2008-01-24-Mailinator Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:A fun exploration of applied searching inHow to search for the word
"pen1s" in 185 emails every second. When indexOf doesn't cut it you just trie
harder.Has a drunken friend ever inspired you to create a first of its kind
internet service that is loved by millions, deemed subversive by thousands,
all while handling over 1.2 billion emails a year on onerickityold server?
That's how Paul Tyma came to build Mailinator.Mailinator is a free no-setup
web service for thwarting evil spammers by creating throw-away registration
email addresses. If you don't give web sites you real email address they can't
spam you. They spam Mailinator instead :-)I love design with a point-of-view
and Mailinator has a big giant harry one: performance first, second, and last.
Why? Because Mailinator is free and that allows Paul to showcase his different
perspective on design. While competitors buy big Iron to handle load, Paul
uses a big idea instead: pick the right problem and create a design to fit the</p><p>6 0.12623513 <a title="1477-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-06-Email_Architecture.html">202 high scalability-2008-01-06-Email Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Rodrigo Guzman, CTO ofiDoneThis, which makes status
reporting happen at your company with the lightest possible touch.iDoneThisis
a simple management application that emails your team at the end of every day
to ask, "What'd you get done today?" Just reply with a few lines of what you
got done. The following morning everyone on your team gets a digest with what
the team accomplished the previous day to keep everyone in the loop and
kickstart another awesome day.Before we launched, we built iDoneThis over a
weekend in the most rudimentary way possible. I kid you not, we sent the first
few batches of daily emails using the BCC field of a Gmail inbox. The upshot
is that we've had users on the site from Day 3 of its existence on.We've gone
from launch in January 2011 when we sent hundreds of emails out per day by
hand to sending out over 1 million emails and handling over 200,000 incoming
emails per month. In total, customers have recorded over 1.7 million

<p>Introduction: Someone reading my now ancientC++ coding standardrecommendation for using
doxygen to automatically generate documentation from source code, asked a
great question:I've often considered using doxygen, I always ask myself - is
this really useful? Would I use it if I were new to a project? Would
programmers working on the project use it?I'll rephrase their question to more
conveniently express a point I've thought a lot about: Why do companies put so
little effort into automating their own development process to make
development easier?It's like the hair stylist whose own hair looks like
someone cut it using a late night infomercial vacuum cleaner attachment. Or
it's like the interior decorator whose own house looks like a monk's
cell.Software organizations rarely build software to make developing software
easier. Why is that?Because there are three ways changes are made in an
organization:Top Dog- Someone so high up in the org chart you would need a

<p>Introduction: A surprising amount of heat and light was generated by the wholeMicrsoft vs
MySpacediscussion. Why people feel so passionate about this I'm not quite
sure, but fortunately for us, in the best sense of the web, it generated an
amazing number of insightful comments and observations. If we stand back and
take a look at the whole incident, what can we take a way that might help us
in the future?All computer companies are technology companies first.  A
repeated theme was that you can't be an entertainment company first. You are a
technology company providing entertainment using technology. The tech can
inform the entertainment side, the entertainment side drives features, but
they really can't be separated. An awesome stack that does nothing is useless.
A great idea on a poor stack is just as useless. There's a difficult balance
that must be achieved and both management and developers must be aware that
there's something to balance.All pigs are equal. All business failures are not

<p>Introduction: My favorite kind of histories are those told from an insider's perspective.
The story of Richard the Lionheart is full of great battles and dynastic
intrigue. The story of one of his soldiers, not so much. Yet the soldiers'
story, as someone who has experienced the real consequences of decisions made
and actions taken, is more revealing.We get such a history in Chat Wars, a
wonderful article written by David Auerbach, who in 1998 worked at Microsoft
on MSN Messenger Service, Microsoft's instant messaging app (for a related
story see The Rise and Fall of AIM, the Breakthrough AOL Never Wanted).It's as
if Herodotus visited Microsoft and wrote down his experiences. It has that
same sort of conversational tone, insightful on-the-ground observations, and
facts no outsider might ever believe.Much of the article is a play-by-play
account of the cat and mouse game David plays changing Messenger to track
AOL's Instant Messenger protocol changes. AOL repeatedly tried to make it so

data across the world. Marko Rodriguez in Memoirs of a Graph Addict: Despair
to Redemption tells a stirring tale of how graph programming saved the world
from certain destruction by realizing Aritstotle's dream of an eudaimonia-
driven society. Could a relational database do that? The tools of the
revolution can be found at tinkerprop.com, which describes a databases
agnostic stack for working with property graphs, they include Blueprints - a
property graph model interface; Pipes - a dataflow netowork using process
grapphs; Gremlin - a graph based programming language; Rexster - a RESTful
graph shell.The never never ending battle of good versus evil has nothing on
programmers arguing about bracket policies or sync vs async programming
models. In this node.js thread, I love async, but I can't code like this, the
battle continues. In the</p><p>2 0.95689631 <a title="1477-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-13-Is_premature_scalation_a_real_disease%3F.html">185 high scalability-2007-12-13-Is premature scalation a real disease?</a></p>

fine noose.Update 2: Kevin says thebiggest problems he sees with startups is
they need to scaletheir backend (no, the other one).Update: My bad.It's hard

you shouldn't spend precious limited resources worrying about scaling before
you've first implemented the functionality that will make you successful
enough to have scaling problems in the first place. It's kind of an embodied
life force model of system creation. Energy is scarce so any parasites
siphoning off energy must be hunted down and destroyed so the body has its
best chance of survival. Is this really how it works?If I ever believed this I
certainly don't believe it anymore. The world has changed, even since

<p>Introduction: You know your product is doing well when most of yourearly blog postsdeal with
the status of the waiting list of hundreds of thousands of users eagerly
waiting to download your product. That's the enviable positionMailbox, a free
mobile email management app, found themselves early in their release cycle.
Hasn't email been done already? Apparently not. Mailbox scaled to one million
users in a paltry six weeks with a team ofabout 14 people. As of April they
were delivering over100 million messages per day.How did they do it? Mailbox
engineering lead,Sean Beausoleil, gave an informative interview on
readwrite.comon how Mailbox planned to scale... Gather signals early. A pre-
release launch video helped generate interest, but it also allowed them to
gauge early interest before even releasing. From the overwhelming response
they knew they would need to have to scale and scale quickly. Have something
unique. The average person might not think a mailbox app would be a fertile
product space. T</p><p>4 0.92554355 <a title="1477-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-24-Scaling_Operations_Saves_Money_and_Scales_Faster.html">130 high scalability-2007-10-24-Scaling Operations Saves Money and Scales Faster</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jesse Robbins at O'Reily Radar has a nicepost on how spendinga little up front
time on figuring out how to scale your operations process saves money on ops
people and allows you to save time adding and upgrading servers. Adding,
monitoring, and upgrading servers can get so incredibly screwed up that a herd
of squirrels has to work overtime just to put out a release. Or it can be one
button simple from your automated build system out to your servers. This is
one area where "do the simplest thing that could possibly work" is a dumb idea
and Jesse does a good job capturing the advantages of doing it right.</p><p>5 0.91704416 <a title="1477-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-01-A_Scalability_checklist%3F.html">375 high scalability-2008-09-01-A Scalability checklist?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi everyone, I'm researching on Scalability for a college paper, and found
this site great, but it has too many tips, articles and the like, but I can't
see a hierarchical organization of subjects, I would need something like a
checklist of things or fields, or technologies to take into account when
assesing scalability.So far I've identified these:- Hardware scalability:-
scale out- scale up- CacheWhat types of cache are there? app-level, os-level,
network-level, I/O-level?- Load Balancing- DB ClusteringAm I missing something
important? (I'm sure I am)I don't expect you to give a lecture here, but maybe
point some things out, give me some useful links...Thanks!</p><p>6 0.91561842 <a title="1477-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-08-Distribution_of_queries_per_second.html">622 high scalability-2009-06-08-Distribution of queries per second</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 6:Some interesting changes from Twitter'sEvan Weaver: everything in RAM
now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by
average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page
cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with
Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every
external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to
load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability;
switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to
get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them
locally.Update 5:Twitter on Scala. A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex
Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners. A fascinating discussion of why

<p>Introduction: For solutions take a look at:7 Life Saving Scalability Defenses Against Load
Monster Attacks.This is a look at all the bad things that can happen to your
carefully crafted program as loads increase: all hell breaks lose. Sure, you
can scale out or scale up, but you can also choose to program better. Make
your system handle larger loads. This saves money because fewer boxes are
needed and it will make the entire application more reliable and have better
response times. And it can be quite satisfying as a programmer.Large Number Of
ObjectsWe usually get into scaling problems when the number of objects gets
larger. Clearly resource usage of all types is stressed as the number of
objects grow.Continuous Failures Makes An Infinite Event StreamDuring large
network failure scenarios there is never time for the system recover. We are
in a continual state of stress.Lots of High Priority WorkFor example,

<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built
by a small group of people, under immense pressure, trying to get a lot of

<p>Introduction: This is the intriguing quote by Bill Venners in an interview with Twitter's
Alex Payne on Twitter's heretical switch from a pure Ruby stack to a Ruby on
Rails stack on the front-end and JVM/Scala on the back-end:So performance was
also one of the problems with JRuby, which I [Bill Venners] think helps
explain better why they'd [Twitter] prefer Scala over Ruby or JRuby for some
things.I have often heard Rubyists say that although Ruby is slower than Java,
for many things it is plenty fast enough, and they are right. The logic goes
further, saying that servers are cheap, and programmers expensive, so it makes
sense to tradeoff some runtime performance for programmer productivity. And I
think that's very often true too, but not always.If you have enough traffic,
at some point the cost of servers outweighs the cost of programmers. I'm not
sure whether Twitter is past that point, but they get a lot of traffic. And
frankly this isn't an intrinsic tradeoff. Other dynamic languages are faster</p><p>5 0.71655726 <a title="1423-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-05-Little%E2%80%99s_Law%2C_Scalability_and_Fault_Tolerance%3A_The_OS_is_your_bottleneck._What_you_can_do%3F.html">1591 high scalability-2014-02-05-Little’s Law, Scalability and Fault Tolerance: The OS is your bottleneck. What you can do?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guestrepostby Ron Pressler, the founder and CEO ofParallel Universe,
a Y Combinator company building advanced middleware for real-time
applications. Little's Law helps us determine the maximum request rate a
server can handle. When we apply it, we find that the dominating factor
limiting a server's capacity is not the hardware but theOS.Should we buy more
hardware if software is the problem? If not, how can we remove that software
limitation in a way that does not make the code much harder to write and
understand?Many modern web applications are composed of multiple (often
many)HTTPservices (this is often called a micro-service architecture). This
architecture has many advantages in terms of code reuse and maintainability,
scalability and fault tolerance. In this post I'd like to examine one
particular bottleneck in the approach, which hinders scalability as well as
fault tolerance, and various ways to deal with it (I am using the term
"scalability" very loosely in this post</p><p>6 0.71291697 <a title="1423-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-04-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_October_5%2C_2012.html">1334 high scalability-2012-10-04-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For October 5, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: SmugMug's CEO & Chief Geek Don MacAskill smugly (hard to resist) gushes over
finally finding, after a long and arduous quest, their "best bang-for-the-buck
storage array." It's theDell MD300. His in-depth explanation of why he prefers
the MD3000 should help anyone with their own painful storage deliberations.
His key points are:breakThe price is right; DAS via SAS, 15 spindles at 15K
rpm each, 512MB of mirrored battery-backed write cache; You can disable read
caching; You can disable read-ahead prefetching; The stripe sizes are
configurable up to 512KB; The controller ignores host-based flush commands by
default; They support an ‘Enhanced JBOD’ mode.His reasoning for the
desirability each option is astute and he even gives you the configuration
options for carrying out the configuration. This is not your average CEO.Don
also speculates that a three tier system using flash (system RAM + flash
storage + RAID disks) is a possible future direction. Unfortunately, flash may
not be the dream</p><p>2 0.95864284 <a title="1423-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-10-Paper%3A_Consensus_Protocols%3A_Paxos___.html">529 high scalability-2009-03-10-Paper: Consensus Protocols: Paxos   </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: Barbara Liskov's Turing Award, and Byzantine Fault Tolerance.Henry
Robinson has created an excellent series of articles on consensus protocols.
We already covered his2 Phase Commitarticle and he also has a3 Phase
Commitarticle showing how to handle 2PC under single node failures.But that is
not enough! 3PC works well under node failures, but fails for network
failures. So another consensus mechanism is needed that handles both network
and node failures. And that'sPaxos.Paxos correctly handles both types of
failures, but it does this by becoming inaccessible if too many components
fail. This is the "liveness" property of protocols. Paxos waits until the
faults are fixed. Read queries can be handled, but updates will be blocked
until the protocol thinks it can make forward progress.The liveness of Paxos
is primarily dependent on network stability. In a distributed heterogeneous
environment you are at risk of losing the ability to make updates. Users hate
that.breakSo when compani</p><p>3 0.9398247 <a title="1423-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-11-What_would_you_like_to_ask_Justin.tv%3F.html">794 high scalability-2010-03-11-What would you like to ask Justin.tv?</a></p>

leadership role in live broadcasting. They get 30 million uniques a month, can
handle 1 million simultaneous broadcasts and hope to grow another magnitude in

<p>Introduction: For the last few months I've been programming a system in Go, so I'm always on
the lookout for information to feed my confirmation bias. An opportunity
popped up when Iron.io wrote about theirexperience using Go to rewrite
IronWorker, their ever busy job execution system, originally coded in Ruby.The
result:Dropped from 30 to 2 servers and the second server was used only for
redundancy.CPU utilization dropped to less than 5%.Memory usage dropped. Only
a "few hundred KB's of memory (on startup) vs our Rails apps which were ~50MB
(on startup)". Cascading failures are now a thing of the past.New services
running on hundreds of servers are all written in Go.They believe using Go
allows them to "build great products, to grow and scale, and attract grade A
talent. And I believe it will continue to help us grow for the foreseeable
future." Picking a language based on the size of the talent pool is a common
recommendation, they've found selecting Go helps them attract top
talent.Deployment is</p><p>5 0.90780467 <a title="1423-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-15-Does_Sun_Buying_MySQL_Change_Your_Scaling_Strategy%3F.html">213 high scalability-2008-01-15-Does Sun Buying MySQL Change Your Scaling Strategy?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sun is buying MySQL for $1 billion. The MySQL team has worked long and hard so
I don't begrudge them their pay day. Strike while the iron is offering a lot
of cash I say. And I have nothing against Sun. Yet I can't help but think this
changes the mental calculation of what database to use. When Oracle acquired
Innobase a new independent storage engine was needed for MySQL. How is this
different? Does this change your thinking any? Would Martha say it's a good
thing? Like Luke I've searched my feelings, but the force is not with me and I
don't really know how I feel about it.</p><p>6 0.88084054 <a title="1423-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-31-Scalable_federated_security_with_Kerberos_.html">832 high scalability-2010-05-31-Scalable federated security with Kerberos </a></p>

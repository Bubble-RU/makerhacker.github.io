<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.   Let's take a short trip down web architecture lane:
  It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl scripts and a SQL database   It's 1995: Scale-up the database.   It's 1998: LAMP   It's 1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SAN   It's 2001: In-memory data-grid.   It's 2003: Add a caching layer.   It's 2004: Add scale-out and partitioning.   It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a distributed file system.   It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.   It's 2008: C</p><p>3 0.11902416 <a title="1407-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-25-Vertical_Scaling_Ascendant_-_How_are_SSDs_Changing__Architectures%3F.html">1291 high scalability-2012-07-25-Vertical Scaling Ascendant - How are SSDs Changing  Architectures?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With Amazon     announcing new High I/O 2TB SSD instances    the age of SSD has almost arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on demand rate the   price per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:   27 cents ($27K/100K IOPS) per vs    $1.25 for disk   .     With the obvious benefits of giant SSD machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it’s interesting to consider: what architecture decisions might you make differently in the future? 
   More Headroom for Vertical Scaling Simplifies Everything   
 The beauty of higher hardware performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This has always been the allure of    vertical scaling    and is well realized by SSDs through a combination of high throughput, low latencies, and just as important, high densities.    We have a few earl</p><p>4 0.11756606 <a title="1407-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-24-Heroku_-_Simultaneously_Develop_and_Deploy_Automatically_Scalable_Rails_Applications_in_the_Cloud.html">579 high scalability-2009-04-24-Heroku - Simultaneously Develop and Deploy Automatically Scalable Rails Applications in the Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 4:   Heroku versus GAE & GAE/J 
 
   Update 3 :   Heroku has gone live! . Congratulations to the team. It's difficult right now to get a feeling for the relative cost and reliability of Heroku, but it's an impressive accomplishment and a viable option for people looking for a delivery platform.
 
 Update 2 :  Heroku Architecture . A great interactive presentation of the Heroku stack. Requests flow into Nginx used as a HTTP Reverse Proxy. Nginx routes requests into a Varnish based HTTP cache. Then requests are injected into an Erlang based routing mesh that balances requests across a grid of dynos. Dynos are your application "VMs" that implement application specific behaviors.  Dynos themselves are a stack of: POSIX, Ruby VM, App Server, Rack, Middleware, Framework, Your App. Applications can access PostgreSQL. Memcached is used as an application caching layer.
 
 Update : Aaron Worsham   Interview with James Lindenbaum, CEO of Heroku . Aaron nicely sums up their goal: Heroku is</p><p>5 0.11447444 <a title="1407-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

 Clay Shirky: I think one of the things that happened to the P2P market for infrastructure is that users preference for predictable pricing vs resource-sensitive pricing is so overwhelming that they will overpay to anyone who can promise flat prices. And because the logic of centralization vs decentralization is so price sensitive, I don't think there is any logical reason to assume a broadly stable class of apps, separate from c</p><p>3 0.81857228 <a title="1407-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-09-07-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_September_7%2C_2012.html">1318 high scalability-2012-09-07-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For September 7, 2012</a></p>

 Upgrades are the great killer of software systems. Do you really want a  pill that would supply materials  with instructions for   nanobots   to form new neurons and place them near existing cells to be replaced so you have a new brain within six months? Scary as hell. But there's an   nanoapp   for that.

<p>Introduction: Hey, it's HighScalability time: 
  
 The Herokulypse. A cautionary tale of what can happen when scalability is left for later. Rap Genius created quite a stir ( reddit ,  Hacker News )  when they documented  high costs ($20K/month for 15 million monthly uniques) and poor performance (6 second average response times) using Heroku's  random routing mesh . The cause was tracked to queuing at the dyno level when the expectation was requests are routed to free dynos. Heroku admits  this is a problem . So poor load balancing combined with RoR single threading = poor performance, one that adding more dynos and spending more money won't necessarily help. While it seems clear Heroku didn't make this aspect of their system crystal clear, the incident has generated a lot of teaching moments, if you slog through it all. This is a developing story.

 Quotable Quotes:                                           
 
  @rodos : With so much manure in the room of #BigData the must be a pony in here somewhere! 
  @adron : #ricon2012 OH "it isn't cloud, nosql or whatever, it's distributed systems... That is the change!" Smartest thing stated at a conf in ages. 
  @justinesherry : First lesson watching @eric_brewer's keynote at #ricon2012 -- distributed systems make you go bald. (Both audience and speaker!)  
  @adron : OH "What's the hello world of distributed systems?" "Twitter." 
  Mikael Ronstrom : A long career on distributed systems has learnt me that it is extremely important to do proper partitioning of data sets to achieve scalability on network level. But it is still extremely important to make each node in the distributed system as large as possible.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Rodrigo Guzman, CTO of  iDoneThis , which makes status reporting happen at your company with the lightest possible touch. 
 
 iDoneThis  is a simple management application that emails your team at the end of every day to ask, "What'd you get done today?"  Just reply with a few lines of what you got done. The following morning everyone on your team gets a digest with what the team accomplished the previous day to keep everyone in the loop and kickstart another awesome day.
 
Before we launched, we built iDoneThis over a weekend in the most rudimentary way possible.  I kid you not, we sent the first few batches of daily emails using the BCC field of a Gmail inbox.  The upshot is that we’ve had users on the site from Day 3 of its existence on.
 
We’ve gone from launch in January 2011 when we sent hundreds of emails out per day by hand to sending out over 1 million emails and handling over 200,000 incoming emails per month.  In total, customers have recorded over 1.</p><p>4 0.93675482 <a title="1407-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-16-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_September_16%2C_2011.html">1117 high scalability-2011-09-16-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For September 16, 2011</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Between love and madness lies  HighScalability : 
  
  Google now 10x better : MapReduce sorts 1 petabyte of data using 8000 computers in 33 minutes;  1 Billion on Social Networks ;  Tumblr at 10 Billion Posts ;  Twitter at 100 Million Users ;  Testing at Google Scale : 1800 builds, 120 million test suites, 60 million tests run daily. 
 From the  Dash Memo  on Google's Plan:  Go is a very promising systems-programming language in the vein of C++. We fully hope and expect that Go becomes the standard back-end language at Google over the next few years.  On GAE  Go can load from  a cold start in 100ms and the typical instance size is 4MB. Is it any wonder Go is a go? Should we expect to see Java and Python deprecated because Go is so much cheaper to run at scale?

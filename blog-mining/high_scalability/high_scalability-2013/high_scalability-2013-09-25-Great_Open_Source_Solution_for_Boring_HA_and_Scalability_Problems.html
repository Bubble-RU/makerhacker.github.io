<p>Introduction: Update:Digg on their choice and use of Puppet. They chose puppet over
cfengine, and bcfg2 because they liked Puppet's resource abstraction layer
(RAL), the ability to implement configuration management incrementally,
support for bundles, and the overall design philosophy.Puppetimplements a
declarative (what not how) configuration language for automating common
administration tasks. It's the system every large site writes for themselves
and it's already made for you! Ilike was able to "easily" scale from0 to
hundreds of serversusing Puppet. I can't believe I've never seen this before.
It looks really cool. What is Puppet and how can it help you scale your
website operations?breakFrom the Puppet website:Puppet has been developed to
help the sysadmin community move to building and sharing mature tools that
avoid the duplication of everyone solving the same problem. It does so in two
ways:* It provides a powerful framework to simplify the majority of the
technical tasks that sysadmins need</p><p>3 0.1059404 <a title="1522-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-07-Startups_are_Creating_a_New_System_of_the_World_for_IT.html">1240 high scalability-2012-05-07-Startups are Creating a New System of the World for IT</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Edd Dumbill wrote an interesting article on O'Reilly Radar covering the
current solutions for running Big Data in the CloudBig data and cloud
technology go hand-in-hand. Big data needs clusters of servers for processing,
which clouds can readily provide.Big PaaSEdd touched briefly on the role of
PaaS for delivering Big Data applications in the cloudBeyond IaaS, several
cloud services provide application layer support for big data work. Sometimes
referred to as managed solutions, or platform as a service (PaaS), these
services remove the need to ucale things such as databases or MapReduce,
reducing your workload and maintenance burden. Additionally, PaaS providers
can realize great efficiencies by hosting at the application level, and pass
those savings on to the customer.To put it simply, managing data clusters is
one thing. Being able to process the data is yet another challenge that we
need to think about when we're dealing with application platforms, as I noted
in one of my earlier</p><p>5 0.09424933 <a title="1522-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-26-ThemBid_Architecture.html">33 high scalability-2007-07-26-ThemBid Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: ThemBid provides a market where people needing work done broadcast their
request and accept bids from people competing for the job. Unlike many of the
sites profiled at HighScalability, ThemBid is not in the popular press as
often as Paris Hilton. It's not a media darling or a giant of the industry.
But what I like is they have a strategy, a point-of-view for building websites
and were gracious enough to share very detailed instructions on how to go
about building a website. They even delve into actual installation details of
the various software packages they use. Anyone can benefit by taking a look at
their work.Site: http://www.thembid.com/Information SourcesBuild Scalable Web

<p>Introduction: One of the cool things we are seeing is more tools and tool chains for
performing very high level operations quite simply.Vagrantis such a tool
forbuilding and distributing virtualized development environments.Web
developers use virtual environments every day with their web applications.
From EC2 and Rackspace Cloud to specialized solutions such as EngineYard and
Heroku, virtualization is the tool of choice for easy deployment and
infrastructure management. Vagrant aims to take those very same principles and
put them to work in the heart of the application lifecycle. By providing easy
to configure, lightweight, reproducible, and portable virtual machines
targeted at development environments, Vagrant helps maximize your productivity
and flexibility.If you've created a build and deployment system before Vagrant

<p>Introduction: Write a little "Hello World" program these days and it runs inside a
bewildering Russian Doll of nested environments, each layer adding its own
special performance and complexity tax. First, a language executes in its own
environment of data structure libraries, memory management, and so on. That,
more often than not, will run inside a language VM like the JVM, CLR, or V8.
The language VM will in-turn run inside a process that runs inside an OS. An
application will run in one or more threads inside a process. And the whole
thing will run inside a machine sharing VM layer like Xen. And across all of
that are frameworks for monitoring, elasticity, storage, and so on. That's a
lot of overhead for a such a little program.What if we could remove all these
taxes and run directly on the new bare metal, which some consider to be a
combination of Machine VM + Cloud API? That's exactly what a system

<p>Introduction: Yesterday, I had a session during the OpenStack Summit where I tried to
present a more general view on how we should be thinking about PaaS in the
context of OpenStack.The key takeaway :The main goal of PaaS is to drive
productivity into the process by which we can deliver new applications.Most of
the existing PaaS solutions take a fairly extreme approach with their
abstraction of the underlying infrastructure and therefore fit a fairly small
number of extremely simple applications and thus miss the real promise of
PaaS.Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk took a more bottom up approach giving us
better set of tradeoffs between the abstraction and control which makes it
more broadly applicable to a larger set of applications.The fact that
OpenStack is opensource allows us to think differently on the things we can do
at the platform layer. We can create a tighter integration between the PaaS
and IaaS layers and thus come up with better set of tradeoffs into the way we
drive productivity without g</p><p>5 0.70362908 <a title="1522-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-07-Startups_are_Creating_a_New_System_of_the_World_for_IT.html">1240 high scalability-2012-05-07-Startups are Creating a New System of the World for IT</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post about how boring and repetitive HA and scalability
problems can be solved via Open Source so you can focus on the interesting
tasks. The post was written byMaarten Ectors, responsible for Cloud Strategy
andFrank Mueller, a Juju Core developer, at Ubuntu/Canonical.High-availability
and scalability are exciting in general but there are certain problems that
experts see over and over again. The list is long but examples are setting up
MySQL clustering, sharding Mongo, adding data nodes to a Hadoop cluster,
monitoring with Ganglia, building continuous deployment solutions, integrating
Memcached / Varnish / Nginx,â&euro;Ś Why are we reinventing the wheel?At Ubuntu we
made it our goal to have the community solve these repetitive and often boring
tasks. How often have you had to set-up MySQL replication and scale it? What
if the next time you just simply do:juju deploy mysqljuju deploy mysql mysql-

a quick gloss I did a little over a year ago on a presentation Instagram gave
on their architecture. In that article I called Instagram's architecture the

know how true that would turn out to be. If you want to learn how they did it

who better to explain the principles behind Enterprise Architecture than the

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byJeffrey Damick, Principal Software Engineer forNeustar.
Jeffrey has overseen the software architecture forUltraDNSfor last two and
half years as it went through substantial revitalization.UltraDNS is one the
top the DNS providers, serving manytop-level domains (TLDs)as well assecond-
level domains (SLDs). This requires handling of several hundreds of thousands
of zones with many containing millions of records each. Even with all of its
success UltraDNS had fallen into a rut several years ago, its release schedule
had become haphazard at best and the team was struggling to keep up with
feature requests in a waterfall development style.DevelopmentRealizing that
something had to be done the team came together and identified the most
important areas to attack first. We began with the code base, stabilizing our
flagship proprietary C++ DNS server, instituting common best practices and
automation. Testing was very manual and not easily reproducible, so we brought

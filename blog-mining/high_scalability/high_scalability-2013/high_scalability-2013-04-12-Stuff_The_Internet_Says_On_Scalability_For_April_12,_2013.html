<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve?

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-
grid.It's 2003: Add a caching layer.It's 2004: Add scale-out and
partitioning.It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a
distributed file system.It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.It's 2008: Cloud

<p>Introduction: This is an interview with Gabriel Weinberg, founder of Duck Duck Go and
general all around startup guru, on what DDG's architecture looks like in
2012.Innovative search engine upstart DuckDuckGo had30 million searchesin
February 2012 and averages over 1 million searches a day. It's being
positioned bysuper investor Fred Wilsonas a clean, private, impartial and fast
search engine. After talking with Gabriel I like what Fred Wilson said
earlier, it seems closer to the heart of the matter:We invested in DuckDuckGo
for the Reddit, Hacker News anarchists.                  Choosing DuckDuckGo
can be thought of as not just a technical choice, but a vote for revolution.
In an age when knowing your essence is not about about love or friendship, but
about more effectively selling you to advertisers, DDG is positioning
themselves as thedo not track alternative, keepers of theprivacy flame. You
will still be monetized of course, but in a more civilized and anonymous way.

<p>Introduction: In update toPrismatic Architecture - Using Machine Learning on Social Networks
to Figure Out What You Should Read on the Web, Jason Wolfe, even in the face
of deadening fatigue from long nights spent getting their iPhone app out, has
gallantly agreed to talk a little more about Primatic's approach to Machine
Learning.Documents and users are two areas where Prismatic applies ML (machine
learning):ML on DocumentsGiven an HTML document: learn how to extract the main
text of the page (rather than the sidebar, footer, comments, etc), its title,
author, best images, etcdetermine features for relevance (e.g., what the
article is about, topics, etc.)The setup for most of these tasks is pretty
typical. Models are trained using big batch jobs on other machines that read
data from s3, save the learned parameter files to s3, and then read (and
periodically refresh) the models from s3 in the ingest pipeline.All of the
data that flows out of the system can be fed back into this pipeline, which

naturally follows this progression. Something is complex so someone does
something to make it easier. Everyone rushes to it but needs one or two things
from the technologies they left behind so they introduce that into the "new"

<p>Introduction: Disqus - Scaling the Worlds Largest Django App. Interesting overview of a
commenting system with 75 million comments and 250 million visitors. Lots of
good details on how they partition their database, testing, continuous
integration, feature switches, caching, delayed signals, and more.Things I
learnt tracking a billion events in 24 hours: Know your host, Scaling isn't
just servers, My servers need to talk to me more, Kill switches for users,
What you don't know is the problem, Don't mix server roles, Know your most
important users outside of your site.Tweets of Gold:georgebarnett: I read High
Scalability for useful articles about large scaling. Sadly though, nothing
useful ever shows up. #NoLongerBotheringnorthscale: wow that is fast! :) RT

<p>Introduction: In a recent thread on Hacker News discussing recent AWS price changes,seldo
mentioned they use AWS for business, they just never use EBS on AWS. A good
question was asked:How do you even do anything without using EBS?Amazon
certainly makes using EBS the easiest path. And EBS has a better reliability
record as of late, but it's still often recommended to not use EBS. This
avoids a single point of failure at the cost of a lot of complexity, though as
AWS uses EBS internally, not using EBS may not save you if you use other AWS
services like RDS or ELB.If you don't want to use EBS, it's hard to know where
to even start. A dilemma to which Kevin Nuckolls gives a great answer:Well,
you break your services out onto stateless and stateful machines. After that,
you make sure that each of your stateful services is resilient to individual

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.How do you scale anAWS(Amazon Web Services) infrastructure?
This article will give you a detailed reply in two parts: the tools you can
use to make the most of Amazon's dynamic approach, and the architectural model
you should adopt for a scalable infrastructure.I base my report on my
experience gained in several AWS production projects in casual gaming
(Facebook), e-commerce infrastructures and within the mainstream GIS
(Geographic Information System). It's true that my experience in gaming
(IsCool, The Game) is currently the most representative in terms of
scalability, due to the number of users (over 800 thousand DAU - daily active
users - at peak usage and over 20 million page views every day), however my
experiences in e-commerce and GIS (currently underway) provide a different
view of scalability, taking into account the various problems of availability
and data management. I will therefore</p><p>5 0.14741434 <a title="1398-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-21-5_Scalability_Poisons_and_3_Cloud_Scalability_Antidotes.html">1121 high scalability-2011-09-21-5 Scalability Poisons and 3 Cloud Scalability Antidotes</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Authored by Chris Fregly:  Former Netflix Streaming Platform Engineer, AWS
Certified Solution Architect and Purveyor of fluxcapacitor.com.Ahead of the
upcoming 2nd annual re:Invent conference, inspired by Simone Brunozzi's
recentpresentationat an AWS Meetup in San Francisco, and collected from a few
of my recentFluxcapacitor.com consulting engagements, I've compiled a list of
10 useful time and clock-tick saving tips about AWS.1) Query AWS resource
metadata Can't remember the EBS-Optimized IO throughput of your c1.xlarge
cluster?  How about the size limit of an S3 object on a single PUT?
awsnow.infois the answer to all of your AWS-resource metadata questions.
Interested in integrating awsnow.info with your application?  You're in luck.
There's now aREST API, as well!Note:  These are default soft limits and will
vary by account.2) Tame your S3 buckets Delete an entire S3 bucket with a

<p>Introduction: Rodrigo Camposshared some interesting benchmark resultsfor AWS instances in
the South America Region (Sao Paulo) and US East Region (North Virginia). He
summarized the results in this thread on theGuerrilla Capacity
Planninglist:The same instance type shows a different behavior depending on
the region that it is running, this is particularly critical if you depend on
multiple regions for disaster recovery or geographical load balancingGenerally
speaking performance is better and more consistent in the South America region
when compared to Virginia, this is probably due to the fact that SA region was
the latest to be deployed. Maybe the SA datacenter uses new server models or
it is just underutilized, but this is a wild guessWrite performance for the
medium instance type in Virginia abruptly decays, dropping from almost 400
call/s to something around 300 calls/s, this is not very clear in the scatter
plot but if you draw a time-based chart you can clearly see this pattern. This

<p>Introduction: With Amazonannouncing new High I/O 2TB SSD instancesthe age of SSD has almost
arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on
demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on
demand rate theprice per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:27 cents
($27K/100K IOPS) per vs$1.25 for disk.With the obvious benefits of giant SSD
machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it's interesting to consider: what
architecture decisions might you make differently in the future?More Headroom
for Vertical Scaling Simplifies EverythingThe beauty of higher hardware
performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows
developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This
has always been the allure ofvertical scalingand is well realized by SSDs
through a combination of high throughput, low latencies, and just as
important, high densities.We have a few early examples showing the performance

Yes, it Delivers More Consistent and Higher Performance IO</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Amazon created a whole new class of service with theirProvisioned IOPSfor RDS,
EBS, and DynamoDB. The idea is simple. If you want more performance, you turn
a dial up. If you want less, you turn a dial down. A beautifully simple model.
You pay for the performance you want, which is different than their previous
cloud model, where performance varied, but you paid only for what you used.
The question: Do these higher priced services really work better?Rodrigo
Campos put this question to the test (only for EBS) by running a benchmark he
describes inIOMelt Provisioned IOPS EBS Benchmark Results - December 2012.The
result?Yes, AWS Provisioned IOPS Volumes Really Deliver More Consistent and
Higher Performance IO:It is clear that the provisioned IOPS EBS volumes offer
a huge performance upgrade when compared to the non-optimized EBS volumes, but
as data has to be spread among more underlying disks or systems, it seems that
the volume is increasingly more susceptible to performance

<p>Introduction: Kevin Burton calculates thatBlekko, one of the barbarian hoard storming
Google's search fortress, would need to spend $5 million just to buy enough
weapons, er storage.Kevin estimates storing a deep crawl of the internet would
take about 5 petabytes. At a projected $1 million per petabyte that's a paltry
$5 million. Less than expected. Imagine in days of old an ambitious noble
itching to raise an army to conquer a land and become its new prince. For a
fine land, and the search market is one of the richest, that would be a smart
investment for a VC to make.In these situations I always ask: What would
Machiavelli do?breakMachiavelli taught some lands are hard to conquer and easy
to keep and some are easy to conquer and hard to keep. A land like France was
easy to conquer because it was filled with nobles. You can turn nobles on each
other because they always hate each other for some reason or another. But it's
hard to keep a land of nobles because they all think they are as good as you

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byShawn Hsiao,Luke Massa, andVictor Luu. Shawn
runsTripAdvisor's Technical Operations team, Luke and Victor interned on his
team this past summer. This post is introduced byAndy Gelfond, TripAdvisor's
head of engineering.It's been a little over a year since our last post about
theTripAdvisor architecture. It has been an exciting year. Our business and
team continues to grow, we are now an independent public company, and we have
continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown -
we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work
across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:56M visitors per
month350M+ pages requests a day120TB+ of warehouse data running on a large
Hadoop cluster, and quickly growingWe also had a very successful college
intern program that brought on over 60 interns this past summer, all who were

<p>Introduction: Several readers had follow-up questions in response toHow FarmVille Scales to
Harvest 75 Million Players a Month. Here are Luke's response to those
questions (and a few of mine).How does social networking makes things easier
or harder?The primary interesting aspect of social networking games is how you
wind up with a graph of connected users who need to be access each other's
data on a frequent basis. This makes the overall dataset difficult if not
impossible to partition.What are examples of the Facebook calls you try to
avoid and how they impact game play?We can make a call for facebook friend
data to retrieve information about your friends playing the game. Normally, we
show a friend ladder at the bottom of the game that shows friend information,
including name and facebook photo. Can you say where your cache is, what form
it takes, and how much cached there is? Do you have a peering relationship
with Facebook, as one might expect at that bandwidth?We use memcache as our

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post written byClaude Johnson, a Lead Site Reliability
Engineer atsalesforce.com.The following is an architectural overview of
salesforce.com's core platform and applications. Other systems such as
Heroku's Dyno architecture or the subsystems of other products such as
work.com and do.com are specifically not covered by this material, although
database.com is. The idea is to share with the technology community some
insight about how salesforce.com does what it does. Any mistakes or omissions
are mine.This is by no means comprehensive but if there is interest, the
author would be happy to tackle other areas of how salesforce.com works.
Salesforce.com is interested in being more open with the technology
communities that we have not previously interacted with. Here's to the start
of "Opening the Kimono" about how we work.Since 1999, salesforce.com has been
singularly focused on building technologies for business that are delivered
over the Internet, displacing traditional e</p><p>6 0.79929048 <a title="1398-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-27-The_Changing_Face_of_Scale_-_The_Downside_of_Scaling_in_the_Contextual_Age_.html">1430 high scalability-2013-03-27-The Changing Face of Scale - The Downside of Scaling in the Contextual Age </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Aditya Agarwal, Director of Engineering at Facebook, gave an excellent Scale
at Facebooktalk that covers their architecture, but the talk is really more
about how to scale an organization by preserving the best parts of its
culture. The key take home of the talk is: You can get the code right, you can
get the products right, but you need to get the culture right first. If you
don't get the culture right then your company won't scale.This leads into the
four meta secrets of scaling at Facebook:Scaling takes IterationDon't Over

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byAndy Gelfond, VP of Engineering for TripAdvisor. Andy
has been with TripAdvisor for six and a half years, wrote a lot of code in the
earlier days, and has been building and running a first class engineering and
operations team that is responsible for the worlds largest travel site.
There's an update for this article atAn Epic TripAdvisor Update: Why Not Run
On The Cloud? The Grand Experiment. For TripAdvisor, scalability is woven into
our organization on many levels - data center, software architecture,
development/deployment/operations, and, most importantly, within the culture
and organization. It is not enough to have a scalable data center, or a
scalable software architecture. The process of designing, coding, testing, and
deploying code also needs to be scalable. All of this starts with hiring and a
culture and an organization that values and supports a distributed, fast, and
effective development and operation of a complex and highly scalable consumer

Operations is one of those departments everyone runs differently as it is
usually anontogeny recapitulates phylogenysituation. With 2,000 databases, 25
terabytes of cache, 90 million active users, and 10,000 servers you know

secrets to better operations?Frequent Releases. A major release once a week
and a minor releases every few days.Create a Cyber Liability Group. At one
time operations was distributed amongst several groups. A permanent operations
group was created to isolate problems and revert problem software components

<p>Introduction: Facebook has been teasing us. While many of their recentacquisitionshave been
surprising, shocking is the only word adequately describing Facebook's5 day
whirlwind acquisitionofOculus, immersive virtual reality visionaries, for a
now paltry sounding $2 billion.Thebacklashis a pandemic, jumping acrosssocial
networkswith the speed only a meme powered by the directly unaffected can
generate.For more than 30 years VR has been the dream burning in the heart of
every science fiction fan. Now that this future might finally be here,
Facebook's ownage makes it seem like a wonderful and hopeful timeline has been
choked off, killing the Metaverse before it even had a chance to begin.For the
many who voted for an open future with theirKickstarter dollars, there's a
deep and personal sense of betrayal, despite Facebook's promise to leave
Oculus alone. The intensity of the reaction is because Oculus matters to
people. It's new, it's different, it creates a better future. It's important

<p>Introduction: Please seeThe Updated Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage for a new
improved list.So many great articles have been written on the Amazon Outage.
Some aim at being helpful, some chastise developers for being so stupid, some
chastise Amazon for being so incompetent, some talk about the pain they and
their companies have experienced, and some even predict the downfall of the
cloud. Still others say we have seen a sea change in future of the cloud, a
prediction that's hard to disagree with, though the shape of the change
remains...cloudy.I'll try to keep this list update as more information comes
out. There will be a lot for developers to consider going forward. If there's
a resource you think should be added, just let me know.Amazon's Explanation of

<p>Introduction: Ali Sadat ofMuleSoft gave interesting presentation at Saturday's Talk Cloudy
to Me! event about their experiences movingMule iON, their ESB (enterprise
service bus) product to the cloud.First, a little aboutTalk Cloudy to Me. This
event is the second one day cloud event put on by Sebastian Stadil, founder of
Scalr, as part of the Cloud Computing Meetup group, also created by Sebastian.
Sebastian has become a master at running these mini-conference style events.
Really a quality job by him and his dedicated crew. These events are free,
sponsored by various vendors; they are short, 11-5; the food is good, Thai;
the venue is nice, eBay; they are on topic, with cloud and other speakers
giving 30-45 minute talks.  More on the event when the video comes out. I type
as fast as I can but I can't do much without the video.Back to Ali Sadat.

<p>Introduction: This is a repost of part 1 of an interviewI did for theBoundary
blog.Boundary:What is Facebook's secret sauce for managing what's got to be
the biggest Big Data project, if you will, on the Web?Hoff:From several
presentations we've learned what Facebook insiders likeAditya AgarwalandRobert
Johnson, both former Directors of Engineering, consider their secret
sauce:Scaling Takes Iteration. Solutions often work in the beginning, but
you'll have to modify them as you go. PHP, for example, is simple to use at
first, but is not a good choice when you have tens of thousands of web
servers.Scaling Takes Iteration. You can say that again.Don't Over-Design.
Just use what you need as you scale your system out. Figure out where you need
to iterate on a solution, optimize something, or completely build a part of
the stack yourself.Choose the Right Tool for the Job. Realize that any choice
comes with overhead. If you really need to use Python then go ahead and, we'll
try to help you succeed. Yet wit</p><p>4 0.95024955 <a title="1444-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-02-The_Updated_Big_List_of_Articles_on_the_Amazon_Outage.html">1033 high scalability-2011-05-02-The Updated Big List of Articles on the Amazon Outage</a></p>
<p>Introduction: SinceThe Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage was published we've a had
few updates that people might not have seen. Amazon of course released their
Summary of the Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS Service Disruption in the US East
Region. Netlix shared theirLessons Learned from the AWS Outage as did Heroku
(How Heroku Survived the Amazon Outage), Smug Mug (How SmugMug survived the
Amazonpocalypse), and SimpleGeo (How SimpleGeo Stayed Up During the AWS
Downtime). The curious thing from my perspective is the general lack of
response to Amazon's explanation. I expected more discussion. There's been
almost none that I've seen. My guess is very few people understand what Amazon
was talking about enough to comment whereas almost everyone feels qualified to
talk about the event itself.Lesson for crisis handlers: deep dive post-mortems
that are timely, long, honestish, and highly technical are the most effective
means of staunching the downward spiral of media attention. Amazon's

<p>Introduction: There's a new clustered file system on the spindle:Kosmos File System (KFS).
Thanks to Rich Skrenta for turning me on to KFS and I think his blogpostsays
it all. KFS is an open source project written in C++ by search startupKosmix.
The team members have a goodpedigreeso there's a better than average chance
this software will be worth considering.After you stop trying to turn KFS into
"Kentucky Fried File System" in your mind, take a look at KFS' intriguing
feature set:breakIncremental scalability: New chunkserver nodes can be added
as storage needs increase; the system automatically adapts to the new
nodes.Availability: Replication is used to provide availability due to chunk
server failures. Typically, files are replicated 3-way.Per file degree of
replication: The degree of replication is configurable on a per file basis,
with a max. limit of 64.Re-replication: Whenever the degree of replication for
a file drops below the configured amount (such as, due to an extended

<p>Introduction: "It's all a numbers game - the dirty little secret of scalable systems"Martin
Thompsonis a High Performance Computing Specialist with a real mission to
teach programmers how to understand the innards of modern computing systems.
He has many talks and classes (listed below) on caches, buffers, memory
controllers, processor architectures, cache lines, etc.His thought is
programmers do not put a proper value on understanding how the underpinnings
of our systems work. We gravitate to the shiny and trendy. His approach is not
to teach people specific programming strategies, but to teach programmers to
fish so they can feed themselves. Without a real understanding strategies are
easy to apply wrongly.  It's strange how programmers will put a lot of effort
into understanding complicated frameworks like Hibernate, but little effort
into understanding the underlying hardware on which their programs run.A major
tenant of Martin's approach is to "lead by experimental observation rather
than what</p><p>5 0.12936497 <a title="1468-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Are_Cloud_Based_Memory_Architectures_the_Next_Big_Thing%3F.html">538 high scalability-2009-03-16-Are Cloud Based Memory Architectures the Next Big Thing?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-
grid.It's 2003: Add a caching layer.It's 2004: Add scale-out and
partitioning.It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a
distributed file system.It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.It's 2008: Cloud

<p>Introduction: i didnt find a nearly good solution for this problem yet:imagine, you're
responsible for a small CDN network (static images), with two different
datacenter. the balancing for the two DC is done with a anycast nameservice (a
nameserver in every DC, user gets on nearest location). so, one of the
scenario is that one of the datacenters goes down completly. you can do a
monitoring on the nameserver and only route to the dc which is still alive, no
problem. But what about the TTL from the DNS-Records? Tiny TTLs like 2 min.
are often ignored by several ISP (e.g. AOL). so, the client doesn't get the IP
from the other Datacenter. what could be a solution in this scenario?</p><p>3 0.91944695 <a title="1468-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-15-Simpler%2C_Cheaper%2C_Faster%3A_Playtomic%27s_Move_from_.NET_to_Node_and_Heroku.html">1340 high scalability-2012-10-15-Simpler, Cheaper, Faster: Playtomic's Move from .NET to Node and Heroku</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ben Lowry, CEO ofPlaytomic. Playtomic is a game
analytics service implemented in about 8000 mobile, web and downloadable games
played by approximately 20 million people daily.Here's a good summary quote by
Ben Lowry on Hacker News:Just over 20,000,000 people hit my API yesterday
700,749,252 times, playing the ~8,000 games my analytics platform is
integrated in for a bit under 600 years in total play time. That's just
yesterday. There are lots of different bottlenecks waiting for people
operating at scale. Heroku and NodeJS, for my use case, eventually alleviated
a whole bunch of them very cheaply.Playtomic began with an almost exclusively
Microsoft.NET and Windows architecture which held up for 3 years before being
replaced with a complete rewrite using NodeJS.  During its lifetime the entire
platform grew from shared space on a single server to a full dedicated, then
spread to second dedicated, then the API server was offloaded to a VPS

<p>Introduction: One stumbling block of the the great march towards virtualization is the
relatively poor performance of resource hungry applications like databases. We
are told to develop and test using VMs, but deploy without them. Which kind of
sucks IMHO. Maybe better virtualization technology can remove this split. This
paper talks about a different approach to virtualization called "container-
based" virtualization that can reportedly double the performance of
traditional hypervisor systems like Xen. It does this by trading isolation for
efficiency. Rather than maintaining complete isolation between VMs the
container approach shares resources between VMs and thus gives higher
performance while still guaranteeing strong fault, resource, and security
isolation. It's yet another battle in computing's endless war of creating and
destroying abstraction layers. I learned a lot from from this paper because of
how it compared and contrasted traditional hypervisor and container based
virtualization strate</p><p>6 0.86495095 <a title="1468-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-13-Busting_4_Modern_Hardware_Myths_-_Are_Memory%2C_HDDs%2C_and_SSDs_Really_Random_Access%3F.html">1475 high scalability-2013-06-13-Busting 4 Modern Hardware Myths - Are Memory, HDDs, and SSDs Really Random Access?</a></p>

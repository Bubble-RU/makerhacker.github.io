[sent-6, score-0.433]
</p><p>2 But what's the best way for you to cache for your application? [sent-7, score-0.266]
</p><p>3 Maybe it's a gnarly SQL query you want to avoid and a little stale data is OK. [sent-12, score-0.638]
</p><p>4 Or maybe you have the temerity to write to your database and cause its cache to flush so database caching isn't sufficient at a certain level of scale. [sent-14, score-0.412]
</p><p>5 Data freshness requires a refrigeration truck or an expiry time on your cache entry that causes stats to be periodically recalculated. [sent-21, score-0.744]
</p><p>6 Now, what happens when your cached data expires and a 1000 requests simultaneously try to recalculate the expensive to calculate data? [sent-22, score-0.501]
</p><p>7 And since memcached operations are not atomic it's possible stale data could be cached and you'll serve stale data. [sent-24, score-1.247]
</p><p>8 No Expire SolutionIf cache items never expire then there can never be a recalculation storm. [sent-27, score-0.515]
</p><p>9 This approach can also be used to pre-warm the the cache so a newly brought up system doesn't peg the database. [sent-31, score-0.352]
</p><p>10 Memcached can still evict your cache item when it starts running out of memory. [sent-33, score-0.543]
</p><p>11 It uses a LRU (least recently used) policy so your cache item may not be around when a program needs it which means it will have to go without, use a local cache, or recalculate. [sent-34, score-0.47]
</p><p>12 This approach also doesn't work well for item specific caching. [sent-36, score-0.29]
</p><p>13 It works for globally calculated items like top N posts, but it doesn't really make sense to periodically cache items for user data when the user isn't even active. [sent-37, score-0.651]
</p><p>14 Stale Date SolutionThis solution introduces a stale date in addition to the expiration date. [sent-39, score-0.741]
</p><p>15 For example, set the item to timeout in 24 hours, but the embedded timeout might be five minutes in the future. [sent-42, score-0.582]
</p><p>16 On a get from the cache determine if the stale timeout expired and on expiry immediately set a time in the future and re-store the data as is. [sent-43, score-1.276]
</p><p>17 Fetch data from the DB and update the cache with the latest value. [sent-45, score-0.419]
</p><p>18 Alexey describes a different two key approach:Create two keys in memcached: MAIN key with expiration time a bit higher than normal + a STALE key which expires earlier. [sent-46, score-0.67]
</p><p>19 If the stale has expired, re-calculate and set the stale key again. [sent-48, score-1.076]
</p><p>20 I dislike embedding meta data with data so I like Alexey's approach a bit better, even though it doubles the key space. [sent-49, score-0.536]

Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we

<p>Introduction: Dormandoshows an enlightened middle wayfor storing sessions in cache and the
database. Sessions are a perfect cache candidate because they are transient,
smallish, and since they are usually accessed on every page access removing
all that load from the database is a good thing. But as Dormando points out
session caches have problems. If you remove expiration times from the cache
and you run out of memory then no more logins. If a cache server fails or
needs to be upgrade then you just logged out a bunch of potentially angry
users.The middle ground Dormando proposes is using both the cache and the
database:Reads: read from the cache first, then the database. Typical cache
logic.Writes: write to memcached every time, write to the database every N
seconds (assuming the data has changed).There's a small chance of data loss,
but you've still greatly reduced the database load while providing
reliability. Nice solution.</p><p>4 0.14318492 <a title="673-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-16-%5BANN%5D_New_Open_Source_Cache_System.html">467 high scalability-2008-12-16-[ANN] New Open Source Cache System</a></p>

system that...* is an in-process cache and external, shared Cache* is
horizontally scalable* stores cached objects to disk* supports associative
keys* is non-transactional* can have any size key and any size data* does
auto-GC based on TTL* is container and platform neutralIt was built in-house
at SHOP.COM (by me) and has powered our website for years. We are open-
sourcing it in the hope that it will be useful to others and to get some help
in its maintenance.This is our first open source attempt and we'd appreciate

<p>Introduction: Isn't the secret to fast, scalable websites tocache everything? Caching, if
not thesecret sauceof many a website, is it at least a popular condiment. But
not so fast says Peter Zaitsev inBeyond great cache hit ratio. The point Peter
makes is that we read about websites likeAmazonandFacebook that can literally
make hundreds of calls to satisfy a user request. Even if you have an awesome
cache hit ratio, pages can still be slow because making and processing all
those requests takes time. The solution is toremove requests all together. You
do this bycaching larger blocksso you have to make fewer requests. The post
has a lot of good advice worth reading: 1) Make non cacheable blocks as small
as possible, 2) Maximize amount of uses of the cache item, 3) Control
invalidation, 4) Multi-Get.</p><p>5 0.85421723 <a title="673-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-17-Intro_to_Caching%2CCaching_algorithms_and_caching_frameworks_part_1.html">495 high scalability-2009-01-17-Intro to Caching,Caching algorithms and caching frameworks part 1</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:AsynchronousHTTP cache validations. A proposed HTTP caching
extension:if your application can afford to show slightly out of date content,
then stale-while-revalidate can guarantee that the user will always be served
directly from the cache, hence guaranteeing a consistent response-time user-
experience.Caching is like aspirin for headaches. Head hurts: pop a 'sprin.
Slow site: add caching.Facebookmust have a lot of headaches because they
popped 805 memcached servers between 10,000 web servers and 1,800 MySQL
servers and they reportedly have a 99% cache hit rate. But what's the best way
for you to cache for your application? It's a remarkably complex and rich
topic. Alexey Kovyrin talks about one common caching problem called theDog
PileEffectinDog-pile Effect and How to Avoid it with Ruby on Rails. Glenn
Franxman also has a Django solution inMintCache.Data is usually cached because
it's too expensive to calculate for every hit. Maybe it's a gnarly SQL query

<p>Introduction: This question was asked over email and I thought a larger audience might want
to take a whack at it.With a business associate, I am trying to develop a
financial software that handles financial reports of listed companies. We
managed to create this database with all the data necessary to do financial
analysis. My associate is a Business Intelligence specialist so he is keen to
use OLAPs databases like Microsoft Analysis Services or Jedox Palo, which
enables in-memory calculations and very fast aggregation, slicing and dicing
of data or write-backs.At the same time I did an online course (MOOC) from
Stanford CS184 called Startup Engineering which promoted/talked a lot about
javascript and especially node.js as the language of the future for servers.As
I am keen to use open-source technologies (would be keen to avoid MS SSAS) for
the development of a website to access this financial data , and there are so
many choices for databases out there (Postgre, MongoDB, MySQL etc..but don't

<p>Introduction: This is a question asked on theycombinatorlist and there are some good
responses. I gave a quick response, but I particularly like neilk's knock out
of the park insightful answer:Read Cal Henderson's book. (I'd add in Theo's
book and Release It! too)The center of your design should be the data store,
not a process. You transition the data store from state to state, securely and
reliably, in small increments.Avoid globals and session state. The more "pure"
your function is, the easier it will be to cache or partition.Don't make your
data store too smart. Calculations and renderings should happen in a separate,
asynchronous process.The data store should be able to handle lots of
concurrent connections. Minimize locking. (Read about optimistic
locking).Protect your algorithm from the implementation of the data store,
with a helper class or module or whatever. But don't (DO NOT) try to build a
framework for any conceivable query. Just the ones your algorithm
needs.Viewing an application as</p><p>4 0.84821719 <a title="673-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-09-FaceStat%27s_Rousing_Tale_of_Scaling_Woe_and_Wisdom_Won.html">344 high scalability-2008-06-09-FaceStat's Rousing Tale of Scaling Woe and Wisdom Won</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lukas Biewald shares a fascinatingslam by slam recountof how
hisFaceStat(upload your picture and be judged by the masses) site was battered
by a link on Yahoo's main page that caused an almost instantaneous 650,000
page view jump on their site. Yahoo spends considerable effort making sure its
own properties can handle the truly massive flow from the main page. Turning
theGreat Eyeof the Internet towards an unsuspecting newborn site must be quite
the diaper ready experience. Theo Schlossnagle eerily prophesized about such
events inThe Implications of Punctuated Scalabilium for Website Architecture:
massive, unexpected and sudden traffic spikes will become more common as a
fickle internet seeks ever for new entertainments (my summary). Exactly

<p>Introduction: There's a popular line of thought that says don't waste time on optimization
because developing features is more important than saving money. True, you can
always add resources, but at some point, especially in a more mature part of a
product lifecycle: performance equals $$$.Two great examples of this evolution
come from Facebook and Google. The upshot is that when you spend time and
money on optimizing your tool chain you can get huge wins in performance,
control, and costs. Certainly, don't bother if you are just starting, but at
some point you may want to switch to big development efforts in improving
efficiency.Facebook and HipHopThe Facebook example is quite well known:HipHop,
a static PHP compiler released in 2010, after two years of development. PHP
because Facebook implements their web tierin PHP. They've now developed a
dynamic compiler,HipHop VM, using techniques like JIT, side exits, HipHop
bytecode, type prediction, and parallel tracelet linking.This is an incredible

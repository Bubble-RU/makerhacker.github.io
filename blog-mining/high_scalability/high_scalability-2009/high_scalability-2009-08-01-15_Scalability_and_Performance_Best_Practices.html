<p>Introduction: Jesper Soderlund put together an excellent list of four general scalability
patterns and four subpatterns in his postScalability patterns and an
interesting story:Load distribution- Spread the system load across multiple
processing unitsLoad balancing / load sharing- Spreading the load across many
components with equal properties for handling the requestPartitioning-
Spreading the load across many components by routing an individual request to
a component that owns that data specificVertical partitioning- Spreading the
load across the functional boundaries of a problem space, separate functions
being handled by different processing unitsHorizontal partitioning- Spreading
a single type of data element across many instances, according to some
partitioning key, e.g. hashing the player id and doing a modulus operation,
etc. Quite often referred to as sharding.Queuing and batch \- Achieve
efficiencies of scale by processing batches of data, usually because the

potential solutions, that they've found while working with their clients. Too
Many Database Calls- too many database query per
request/transaction.Synchronized to Death- in a high-load or production
environment over-synchronization results in severe performance and scalability
problems.Too chatty on the remoting channels- too many calls across these
remoting boundaries and in the end causes performance and scalability
problems.Wrong usage of O/R-Mappers- incorrect usage of the framework itself
too often results in unexpected performance and scalability problems within
these frameworks.Memory Leaks- GC does not prevent memory leaks, it is
important to release object references as soon as they are no longer
needed.Problematic 3rd Party Code/Components- check of every framework before

<p>Introduction: InZen And The Art Of Scaling - A Koan And Epigram Approach,Russell
Sullivanoffered an interesting conjecture: there are 20 classic bottlenecks.
This sounds suspiciously like the idea that there only20 basic story plots.
And depending on how you chunkify things, it may be true, but in practice we
all know bottlenecks come in infinite flavors, all tasting of sour and ash.One
dayAurelien Broszniowskifrom Terracotta emailed me his list of bottlenecks, we
cc'ed Russell in on the conversation, he gave me his list, I have a list, and
here's the resulting stone soup.Russell said this is his "I wish I knew when I
was younger" list and I think that's an enriching way to look at it. The more
experience you have, the more different types of projects you tackle, the more
lessons you'll be able add to a list like this. So when you read this list,
and when you make your own, you are stepping through years of accumulated
experience and more than a little frustration, but in each there is a story

<p>Introduction: Ehcacheis a pure Java cache with the following features: fast, simple, small
foot print, minimal dependencies, provides memory and disk stores for
scalability into gigabytes, scalable to hundreds of cachesis a pluggable cache
for Hibernate, tuned for high concurrent load on large multi-cpu servers,
provides LRU, LFU and FIFO cache eviction policies, and is production tested.
Ehcache is used byLinkedInto cache member profiles. The user guide says it's
possible to get at 2.5 times system speedup for persistent Object Relational
Caching, a 1000 times system speedup for Web Page Caching, and a 1.6 times
system speedup Web Page Fragment Caching.From the

ehcache, it is worth stepping back and thinking about caching generally.About

<p>Introduction: GemStone has unveiled GemFire 6.0 which is the culmination of several years of
development and the continuous solving of the hardest data management problems
in the world. With this release GemFire touts some of the latest innovative
features in data management.In this release:- GemFire introduces a resource
manager to continuously monitor and protect cache instances from running out
of memory, triggering rebalancing to migrate data to less loaded nodes or
allow dynamic increase/decrease in the number of nodes hosting data for linear
scalability without impeding ongoing operations (no contention points).-
GemFire provides explicit control over when rebalancing can be triggered, on
what class of data and even allows the administrator to simulate a "rebalance"
operation to quantify the benefits before actually doing it.- With built in
instrumentation that captures throughput and latency metrics, GemFire now
enables applications to sense changing performance patterns and proactively

<p>Introduction: Jeff Atwood started a barn burner of a conversation inMaybe Normalizing Isn't
Normalon how to create a fast scalable tagging system. Jeff eventually asks
that terrible question:which is better -- a normalized database, or a
denormalized database?And all hell breaks loose. I know, it's hard to imagine
database debates becoming contentious, but it does happen :-) It's lucky
developers don't have temporal power or rivers of blood would flow.Here are a
few of the pithier points (summarized):breakNormalization is not magical fairy
dust you sprinkle over your database to cure all ills; it often creates as
many problems as it solves. (Jeff)Normalize until it hurts, denormalize until
it works. (Jeff)Use materialized views which are tables created and maintained
by your RDBMS. So a materialized view will act exactly like a de-normalized
table would - except you keep you original normalized structure and any change
to original data will propagate to the view automatically. (Goran)According to

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byZardosht Kasheff, Software Developer atTokutek, a
storage engine company that delivers 21st-Century capabilities to the leading
open source data management platforms.As software developers, we value
abstraction. The simpler the API, the more attractive it becomes. Arguably,
MongoDB's greatest strengths are its elegant API and itsagility, which let
developers simply code.But whenMongoDBruns into scalability problems onbig
data, developers need to peek underneath the covers to understand the
underlying issues and how to fix them. Without understanding, one may end up
with an inefficient solution that costs time and money. For example, one may
shard prematurely, increasing hardware and management costs, when a simpler
replication setup would do. Or, one may increase the size of a replica set

<p>Introduction: Sun FireTM X4540 Server as Backup Server for Zmanda's Amanda Enterprise 2.6
Softwareby Thomas Hanvey (Sun Microsystems) and Dmitri Joukovski and Ken
Crandall (Zmanda)September, 2008Explosive data growth, combined with demanding
requirements for data availability, has placed a tremendous burden on IT
operations staff at businesses of all sizes. Yet, many organizations do not
have the staff or budget to purchase and manage complex and expensive backup
and recovery software products.The Sun FireTM X4540 server can deliver massive
storage capacity and remarkable throughput so it is well-suited as a nearline
storage platform for backup and restore applications. Combining the power of
the SolarisTM 10 Operating System with the data integrity and simplified
administration of ZFS, the Sun Fire X4540 server can be an ideal candidate for
streamlining and improving backup and restore operations.Amanda Enterprise
Edition from Zmanda was designed to address these challenges, providing a

<p>Introduction: Wikipedia andWikimediahave some of the best, most complete real-world
documentation on how to build highly scalable systems. This paper by Domas
Mituzas covers a lot of details about how Wikipedia works, including: an
overview of the different packages used (Linux, PowerDNS, LVS, Squid,
lighttpd, Apache, PHP5, Lucene, Mono, Memcached), how they use their CDN, how
caching works, how they profile their code, how they store their media, how
they structure their database access, how they handle search, how they handle
load balancing and administration. All with real code examples and examples of
configuration files. This is a really useful resource.Related

<p>Introduction: Snoozeis an open-source, scalable, autonomic, and energy-efficient virtual
machine (VM) management framework for private clouds. Similarly to other VM
management frameworks such as Nimbus, OpenNebula, Eucalyptus, and OpenStack it
allows to build compute infrastructures from virtualized resources.
Particularly, once installed and configured users can submit and control the
life-cycle of a large number of VMs. However, contrary to existing frameworks
for scalability and fault tolerance, Snooze employs a self-organizing and
healing (based on Apache ZooKeeper) hierarchical architecture. Moreover, it
performs distributed VM management and is designed to be energy efficient.
Therefore, it implements features to monitor and estimate VM resource (CPU,
memory, network Rx, network Tx) demands, detect and resolve overload/underload
situations, perform dynamic VM consolidation through live migration, and
finally power management to save energy. Last but not least, it integrates a
generic scheduler</p><p>6 0.63263863 <a title="668-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-28-6_Strategies_for_Scaling_BBC_iPlayer.html">908 high scalability-2010-09-28-6 Strategies for Scaling BBC iPlayer</a></p>

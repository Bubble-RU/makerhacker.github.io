<p>Introduction: Infinispan  is a highly scalable, open source licensed data grid platform in the style of  GigaSpaces  and Oracle  Coherence .
 
From their website:
   The purpose of Infinispan is to expose a data structure that is highly concurrent, designed ground-up to make the most of modern multi-processor/multi-core architectures while at the same time providing distributed cache capabilities.  At its core Infinispan exposes a JSR-107 (JCACHE) compatible Cache interface (which in turn extends java.util.Map).  It is also optionally is backed by a peer-to-peer network architecture to distribute state efficiently around a data grid.  Offering high availability via making replicas of state across a network as well as optionally persisting state to configurable cache stores, Infinispan offers enterprise features such as efficient eviction algorithms to control memory usage as well as JTA compatibility.

<p>Introduction: After winning a CSC Leading Edge Forum (LEF) research grant, I (Paul Colmer) wanted to publish some of the highlights of my research to share with the wider technology community.
 
 What is an In Memory Data Grid? 
 
It is not an in-memory relational database, a NOSQL database or a relational database.  It is a different breed of software datastore.
 
In summary an IMDG is an ‘off the shelf’ software product that exhibits the following characteristics:
 
The data model is distributed across many servers in a single location or across multiple locations.  This distribution is known as a data fabric.  This distributed model is known as a ‘shared nothing’ architecture.
  
 All servers can be active in each site. 
 All data is stored in the RAM of the servers. 
 Servers can be added or removed non-disruptively, to increase the amount of RAM available. 
 The data model is non-relational and is object-based.  
 Distributed applications written on the .NET and Java application platforms are s</p><p>4 0.1162242 <a title="708-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-01-Data_grid_comparison%3A_Oracle_Coherence_vs_Gigaspaces_XAP.html">613 high scalability-2009-06-01-Data grid comparison: Oracle Coherence vs Gigaspaces XAP</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The SHOP.COM Cache System is now available at http://code.google.com/p/sccache/     The SHOP.COM Cache System is an object cache system that...   * is an in-process cache and external, shared Cache   * is horizontally scalable   * stores cached objects to disk   * supports associative keys   * is non-transactional   * can have any size key and any size data   * does auto-GC based on TTL   * is container and platform neutral     It was built in-house at SHOP.COM (by me) and has powered our website for years. We are open-sourcing it in the hope that it will be useful to others and to get some help in its maintenance.     This is our first open source attempt and we'd appreciate any help and comments.</p><p>4 0.67395777 <a title="708-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-16-WTF_is_Elastic_Data_Grid%3F_%28By_Example%29.html">843 high scalability-2010-06-16-WTF is Elastic Data Grid?

<p>Introduction: Forrester released their new wave report:  T he Forrester Wave™: Elastic Caching Platforms, Q2 2010  where they listed GigaSpaces, IBM, Oracle, and Terracotta as leading vendors in the field. In this post I'd like to take some time to explain what some of these terms mean, and why they’re important to you. I’ll start with a definition of Elastic Data Grid (Elastic Caching), how it is different then other caching and NoSQL alternatives, and more importantly -- I'll illustrate how it works through some real code examples.

<p>Introduction: The Gear6 Web Cache hybrid DRAM-flash memory architecture allows for 5-10 times more memcache memory per unit of rack space than DRAM-only configurations, and cuts memory costs by 50%. Other software enhancements include a slab allocator that is more efficient than traditional memcache implementations due to its fine-grained bucket sizing. Gear6 Web Cache also supports object sizes greater than 1 megabyte and manages evictions based on the cost of replacing objects, depending on the size and frequency of object access. It intelligently places cache instances across DRAM and flash, taking into account their different characteristics, while at the same time monitoring their health and detecting and deâ&euro;?allocating faulty or failing memory.  Gear6 Web Cache is a Memcached protocol compliant solution that scales and accelerates web applications, reduces memory footprint, enhances availability and implements comprehensive Memcached management features.

<p>Introduction: Just thought I'd drop a brief suggestion to anyone building a large mail system. Our solution for scaling mail pickup was to develop a sharded architecture whereby accounts are spread across a cluster of servers, each with imap/pop3 capability. Then we use a cluster of reverse proxies (Perdition) speaking to the backend imap/pop3 servers . The benefit of this approach is you can use simply use round-robin or HA loadbalancing on the perdition servers that end users connect to (e.g. admins can easily move accounts around on the backend storage servers without affecting end users). Perdition manages routing users to the appropriate backend servers and has MySQL support. What we also liked about this approach was that it had no dependency on a distributed or networked filesystem, so less chance of corruption or data consistency issues. When an individual server reaches capacity, we just off load users to a less used server. If any server goes offline, it only affects the fraction of users</p><p>same-blog 2 0.8456319 <a title="708-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-17-Infinispan_narrows_the_gap_between_open_source_and_commercial_data_caches_.html">708 high scalability-2009-09-17-Infinispan narrows the gap between open source and commercial data caches </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Recently I attended a lecture presented by Manik Surtani , JBoss Cache & Infinispan project lead. The goal of the talk was to provide a technical overview of both products and outline Infinispan's road-map. Infinispan is the successor to the open-source JBoss Cache. JBoss Cache was originally targeted at simple web page caching and Infinispan builds on this to take it into the Cloud paradigm.  Why did I attend? Well, over the past few years I have worked on projects that have used commercial  distributed caching (aka data grid) technologies such as GemFire, GigaSpaces XAP or Oracle Coherence . These projects required more functionality than is currently provided by open-source solutions such as memcached or EHCache. Looking at the road-map for Infinispan, I was struck by its ambition â&euro;&ldquo; will it provide the functionality that I need?

<p>Introduction: I first heard an enthusiastic endorsement ofSquarespacestreaming from the
ubiquitousLeo Laporteon one of his many Twit Live shows. Squarespace as afully
hosted, completely managed environment for creating and maintaining a website,
blog or portfoliowas of interest to me because they promise scalability and
this site doesn't have enough of that. But sadly, since they don't offer a
link preserving Drupal import our relationship was not meant to be.When a fine
reader of High Scalability, Brian Egge, (and all my readers are thrifty,
brave, and strong) asked me how Squarespace scaled I said I didn't know, but I
would try and find out. I emailed Squarespace a few questions and founder
Anthony Casalena and Director of Technical Operations Rolando Berrios were
kind enough to reply in some detail. The questions were both from Brian and
myself. Answers can be found below.Two things struck me most about
Squarespace's approach:They based their system on a memory grid, in this case

<p>Introduction: Before you proceed make sure you have physical volume(something like
/dev/sda1, /dev/sda4, etc) with no data. This is going to be the gfs volume
which you will export to other nodes. It should be on the node which is going
to be your gnbd server. If you dont have such volume create one using fdisk.I
used mounted gfs volume as a DOCUMENT ROOT for my Apache server nodes(Load
Balanced).I tried it on FC4 64-bit. If you plan to try it on any other
distribution or 32-bit arch.. still the procedure remains same. Since I built
it from source but not RPMs, you may have to simply supply config options with
a different CFLAGS.Full details at http://linuxsutra.chakravaka.com/redhat-

they seem to consider them unreliable with limits around scalability,
performance and availability.And then you start looking at some of the big

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Steffen Konerow, author of theHigh Performance
Blog.Learning how to scale isn't easy without any prior experience. Nowadays
you have plenty of websites likehighscalability.comto get some inspiration,
but unfortunately there is no solution that fits all websites and needs. You
still have to think on your own to find a concept that works for your
requirements. So did I.A few years ago, my bosses came to me and said "We've
got a new project for you. It's the relaunch of a website that has already 1
million users a month. You have to build the website and make sure we'll be
able to grow afterwards". I was already an experienced coder, but not in these
dimensions, so I had to start learning how to scale - the hard way.The
software behind the website was a PHP content management system, based on
Smarty and MySQL. The first task was finding a proper hosting company who had
the experience and would also manage the servers for us. After some research
we found one, told t</p><p>3 0.67393553 <a title="690-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-16-Product%3A_lbpool_-_Load_Balancing_JDBC_Pool.html">157 high scalability-2007-11-16-Product: lbpool - Load Balancing JDBC Pool</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From the website:Thelbpool projectprovides a load balancing JDBC driver for
use with DB connection pools. It wraps a normal JDBC driver providing
reconnect semantics in the event of additional hardware availability, partial
system failure, or uneven load distribution. It also evenly distributes all
new connections among slave DB servers in a given pool. Each time connect() is
called it will attempt to use the best server with the least system load.The
biggest scalability issue with large applications that are mostly READ bound
is the number of transactions per second that the disks in your cluster can
handle. You can generally solve this in two ways.1. Buy bigger and faster
disks with expensive RAID controllers.2. Buy CHEAP hardware on CHEAP disks but
lots of machines.We prefer the cheap hardware approach and lbpool allows you
to do this.Even if you *did* manage to use cheap hardware most load balancing
hardware is expensive, requires a redundant balancer (if it were to fail), and

<p>Introduction: Hey,I do have a website that I would like to scale. Right now we have 10
servers but this does not scale well.I know how to deal with my apache web
servers but have problems with sql servers.I would like to use the "scale out"
system and add servers when we need. We have over 100Gb of data for mysql and
we tried to have around 20G per server. It works well except that if a server
goes down then 1/5 of the user can't access the website. We could use
replication but we would need to at least double sql servers to replicate each
server. And maybe in the future it's not gonna be enough we would need maybe 3
slaves per master ... well I don't really like this idea.I would prefer to
have 8 servers that all deal with data from the 5 servers we have right now
and then we could add new servers when we need. I looked at NFS but that does
not seem to be a good idea for SQL servers ? Can you confirm?</p><p>5 0.66622424 <a title="690-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-10-Mysql_scalability_and_failover....html">302 high scalability-2008-04-10-Mysql scalability and failover...</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,I am an owner of an large community website and currently we are having
problems with our database architecture. We are using 2 database servers and
spread tables across them to divide read/writes. We have about 90% reads and
10% writes. We use Memcached on all our webservers to cache as much as we can,
traffic is load balanced between webservers. We have 2 extra servers ready to
put to use!We have looked into a couple of solution so far:Continuent
Uni/Cluster aka Sequoia -> Commercial version way too expensive and Java isn't
as fast as it suppose to be.MySQL Proxy -> We couldn't find any good example
on how to create a master - master with failover scenario.MySQL Clustering ->
Seems to be not mature enough, had a lot of performance issues when we tried
to go online with it.MySQL DRDB HA -> Only good for failover, cannot be
scaled!MySQL Replication -> Well don't get me started ;)So now I turn to you

<p>Introduction: I've recently started working with a large company who is looking to take one
of their heavily utilized applications and move it to Amazon Web Services. I'm
not looking to start a debate on the merits of EC2, the decision to move to
aws is already made (and is a much better decision than paying a vendor
millions to host it).I've done my reasearch and I'm comfortable with creating
this environment with one exception, scaling MySQL. I havent done much work
with MySQL, i'm more of an Oracle guy up to now. I'm struggling to determine a
way to scale MySQL on the fly in a way so that replication works, the server
takes its proper place in line for master candidacy, and the apache servers
become aware of it.So this is really three questions:1. What are some proven
methods of load balancing the read traffic going from apache to MySQL.2. How
do I let the load balancing mechanism know when I scale up / down a new Mysql
Server?3. How to alert the master of the new server and initiate replication</p><p>2 0.90696967 <a title="690-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-16-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_June_16%2C_2010.html">842 high scalability-2010-06-16-Hot Scalability Links for June 16, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You're Doing it Wrong by Poul-Henning Kamp. Don't look so guilty, he's not
talking about you know what, he's talking about writing high-performance
server programs: Not just wrong as in not perfect, but wrong as in wasting
half, or more, of your performance. What good is an O(log2(n)) algorithm if
those operations cause page faults and slow disk operations? For most relevant
datasets an O(n) or even an O(n^2) algorithm, which avoids page faults, will
run circles around it. A Microsoft Windows Azure primer: the basicsby Peter
Bright. Nice article explaining the basics of Azure and how it compares to
Google and Amazon.A call to change the name from NoSQL to Postmodern
Databases. Interesting idea, but the problem is the same one I have for
Postmodern Art, when is it? I always feel like I'm in the post-post modern
period, yet for art it's really in the early 1900s. Let's save future
developers from this existential time crisis.Constructions from Dots and

<p>Introduction: Why is there something rather than nothing? That's the kind of question
theLarge Hadron Colliderin CERN is hopefully poised to answer. And what is the
output of this beautiful 17-mile long,6 billion dollar wabi-sabishproton
smashing machine? Data. Great heaping torrents of Grand Canyon sized data. 15
million gigabytes every year. That's 1000 times the information printed in
books every year. It's so much data 10,000 scientists will use agridof80,000+
computers, in 300 computer centers , in 50 different countries just to help
make sense of it all.How will all this data be collected, transported, stored,
and analyzed? It turns out, using what amounts to sort of Internet of
Particles instead of an Internet of Things.Two good articles have recently
shed some electro-magnetic energy in the human visible spectrum on the IT
aspects of the collider:LHC computing grid pushes petabytes of data, beats

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byDoug Judd, original creator of Hypertable and the CEO
of Hypertable, Inc.Hypertable delivers 2X better throughput in most tests --
HBase fails 41 and 167 billion record insert tests, overwhelmed by garbage
collection -- Both systems deliver similar results for random read uniform
testWe recently conducted a test comparing the performance of Hypertable
(@hypertable) version 0.9.5.5 to that of HBase (@HBase) version 0.90.4
(CDH3u2) running Zookeeper 3.3.4.  In this post, we summarize the results and
offer explanations for the discrepancies. For the full test report,
seeHypertable vs. HBase II.IntroductionHypertable and HBase are both open
source, scalable databases modeled after Google's proprietary Bigtable
database.  The primary difference between the two systems is that Hypertable
is written in C++, while HBase is written in Java.  We modeled this test after
the one described in section 7 of theBigtable paperand tuned both systems for
maximum performance.

<p>Introduction: I remember the excitement of when Twitter first opened up their firehose. As
an early adopter of the Twitter API I could easily imagine some of the cool
things you could do with all that data. I also remember the disappointment of
learning that in the land of BigData, data has a price, and that price would
be too high for little fish like me. It was like learning for the first time
there would be no BigData Santa Clause.For a while though I had the pleasure
of pondering just how I would handle all that data. It's a fascinating
problem. You have to be able to reliably consume it, normalize it, merge it
with other data, apply functions on it, store it, query it, distribute it, and
oh yah, monetize it. Most of that in realish-time. And if you are trying to
create a platform for allowing the entire Internet do to the same thing to the
firehose, the challenge is exponentially harder.DataSift is in the exciting
position of creating just such a firehose eating, data chomping machine. You

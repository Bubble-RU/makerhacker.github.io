<p>Introduction: Hi there,      I have an idea for an online database that services a large number of people. I've been studying it for a while and it seems feasible to me to create it and get people to populate it. It will need time to grow but eventually it will get there.      The model I'm looking at is IMDB, the depth of information is fascinating, yet it's fast, not so easy to use though, but it's pretty usable!      What do you think I need to create a database an online database like IMDB. I know that IMDB power comes from it's information, not the design of the site. This is something I kind of figured out.      But what I need to know is the best tools to publish database contents on the web, retrieve it in that fast way like IMDB. I'm sure that I will need to create data entry logs for my users to populate the database.      What programming languages you suggest? development environment? approaches?      your contribution is highly appreciated.      Regards,    Jalil</p><p>3 0.12136698 <a title="752-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-22-Why_not_Cache_from_Intersystems%3F.html">164 high scalability-2007-11-22-Why not Cache from Intersystems?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have some experience with a very large OLTP system that is 7+ TB in size and performs very well for 30K+ concurrent users.  It is built using Intersystems Cache based on the very old but very scalable MUMPS platform.  Why don't I see more discussions about archiectures such as these in this forum?  I am curious why this platform scales so much better then the typical RDBMS.</p><p>4 0.097188517 <a title="752-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-09-NoSQL_on_the_Microsoft_Platform.html">875 high scalability-2010-08-09-NoSQL on the Microsoft Platform</a></p>
<p>Introduction: NoSQL is a trend that is gaining steam primarily in the world of Open Source. There are numerous NoSQL solutions available for all levels of complexity: from queryable distributed solutions like MongoDB to simpler distributed key-value storage solutions like Cassandra. Then there’s Riak, Tokyo Cabinet, Voldemort, CouchDB, and Redis. However, very few of these packaged NoSQL products are available for the other end of the platform market: Microsoft Windows. I’m going to outline what’s available now and briefly touch on some opportunities that are still available to the daring Microsoft engineer.

<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great scalability solution, but caching also  comes with problems .  Sharding  is a great scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in a  post-mortem  about their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database Foursquare uses, also contributed their  post-mortem  of what went wrong too.
 
Now that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?
 
First, like for  Facebook , huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in a pretty cool industry.
 
Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built by a small group of people, under immense pressure</p><p>3 0.61493367 <a title="752-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-05-10_Things_You_Should_Know_About_Running_MongoDB_at_Scale.html">1606 high scalability-2014-03-05-10 Things You Should Know About Running MongoDB at Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Guest post by  Asya Kamsky , Principal Solutions Architect at MongoDB. 
 
This post outlines ten things you need to know for operating MongoDB at scale based on my experience working with MongoDB customers and open source users:
  
  MongoDB requires DevOps, too.  MongoDB is a database. Like any other data store, it requires capacity planning, tuning, monitoring, and maintenance. Just because it's easy to install and get started and it fits the developer paradigm more naturally than a relational database, don't assume that MongoDB doesn't need proper care and feeding.  And just because it performs super-fast on a small sample dataset in development doesn't mean you can get away without having a good schema and indexing strategy, as well as the right hardware resources in production! But if you prepare well and understand the best practices, operating large MongoDB clusters can be boring instead of nerve-wracking. 
  Successful MongoDB users monitor everything and prepare for growth.</p><p>4 0.59857321 <a title="752-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-30-Why_Existing_Databases_%28RAC%29_are_So_Breakable%21.html">748 high scalability-2009-11-30-Why Existing Databases (RAC) are So Breakable!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the core assumption behind many of today’s databases is that disks are reliable. In other words, your data is “safe” if it is stored on a disk, and indeed most database solutions rely heavily on that assumption. Is it a valid assumption?

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.   Let's take a short trip down web architecture lane:
  It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl scripts and a SQL database   It's 1995: Scale-up the database.   It's 1998: LAMP   It's 1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SAN   It's 2001: In-memory data-grid.   It's 2003: Add a caching layer.   It's 2004: Add scale-out and partitioning.   It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a distributed file system.   It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.

<p>Introduction: Current disk based RDBMS can run out of steam when processing large data. Can these problems be solved by migrating from a disk based RDBMS to an IMDB? Any limitations? To find out, I tested one of each from the two leading vendors who together hold 70% of the market share - Oracle's  11g  and  TimesTen 11g , and IBM's  DB2 v9.5  and  solidDB 6.3 .

<p>Introduction: In update to  Prismatic Architecture - Using Machine Learning on Social Networks to Figure Out What You Should Read on the Web , Jason Wolfe, even in the face of deadening fatigue from long nights spent getting their iPhone app out, has gallantly agreed to talk a little more about Primatic's approach to Machine Learning.
 
Documents and users are two areas where Prismatic applies ML (machine learning):
  ML on Documents   
 Given an HTML document:Â         
 
 learn how to extract the main text of the page (rather than the sidebar, footer, comments, etc), its title, author, best images, etc 
 determine features for relevance (e.g., what the article is about, topics, etc.) 
 
 
 The setup for most of these tasks is pretty typical. Models are trained using big batch jobs on other machines that read data from s3, save the learned parameter files to s3, and then read (and periodically refresh) the models from s3 in the ingest pipeline.  
 All of the data that flows out of the system can be</p><p>4 0.81462705 <a title="752-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-25-non-sequential%2C_unique_identifier%2C_strategy_question.html">606 high scalability-2009-05-25-non-sequential, unique identifier, strategy question</a></p>
<p>Introduction: (Please bare with me, I'm a new, passionate, confident and terrified programmer :D )     Background:   I'm pre-launch and 1 year into the development of my application.  My target is to be able to eventually handle millions of registered users with 5-10% of them concurrent.  Up to this point I've used auto-increment to assign unique identifiers to rows.  I am now considering switching to a non-sequential strategy.  Oh, I'm using the LAMP configuration.     My reasons for avoiding auto-increment:   1.  Complicates replication when scaling horizontally.  Risk of collision is significant (when running multiple masters).  Note: I've read the other entries in this forum that relate to ID generation and there have been some great suggestions -- including a strategy that uses auto-increment in a way that avoids this pitfall... That said, I'm still nervous about it.   2.  Potential bottleneck when retrieving/assigning IDs -- IDs assigned at the database.     My reasons for being nervous about</p><p>5 0.77783751 <a title="752-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-12-Paper%3A_Scalable_Eventually_Consistent_Counters_over_Unreliable_Networks.html">1611 high scalability-2014-03-12-Paper: Scalable Eventually Consistent Counters over Unreliable Networks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Counting at scale in a distributed environment is  surprisingly hard . And it's a subject we've covered before in various ways:  Big Data Counting: How to count a billion distinct objects using only 1.5KB of Memory ,  How to update video views count effectively? ,  Numbers Everyone Should Know (sharded counters) .
 
 Kellabyte  (which is an excellent blog) in  Scalable Eventually Consistent Counters  talks about how the Cassandra counter implementation scores well on the scalability and high availability front, but in so doing has "over and under counting problem in partitioned environments."
 
Which is often fine. But if you want more accuracy there's a PN-counter, which is a  CRDT (convergent replicated data type)  where "all the changes made to a counter on each node rather than storing and modifying a single value so that you can merge all the values into the proper final value. Of course the trade-off here is additional storage and processing but there are ways to optimize this."</p><p>6 0.76020771 <a title="752-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-27-Heroku_Emergency_Strategy%3A_Incident_Command_System_and_8_Hour_Ops_Rotations_for_Fresh_Minds.html">1030 high scalability-2011-04-27-Heroku Emergency Strategy: Incident Command System and 8 Hour Ops Rotations for Fresh Minds</a></p>

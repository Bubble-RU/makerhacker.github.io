<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble wrote a fascinating case study,  MySpace’s death spiral: insiders say it’s due to bets on Los Angeles and Microsoft , where he reports MySpace insiders blame the Microsoft stack on why they  lost the great social network race  to Facebook.  
 
Does anyone know if this is true? What's the real story?
 
I was wondering because it doesn't seem to track with the  MySpace Architecture  post that I did in 2009, where they seem happy with their choices and had stats to back up their improvements. Why this matters is it's a fascinating model for startups to learn from. What does it really take to succeed? Is it the people or the stack? Is it the organization or the technology? Is it the process or the competition? Is the quality of the site or the love of the users? So much to consider and learn from.
 
Some conjectures from the article:
  
 Myspace didn't have programming talent capable of scaling the site to compete with Facebook.

<p>Introduction: A surprising amount of heat and light was generated by the whole  Micrsoft vs MySpace  discussion. Why people feel so passionate about this I'm not quite sure, but fortunately for us, in the best sense of the web, it generated an amazing number of insightful comments and observations. If we stand back and take a look at the whole incident, what can we take a way that might help us in the future?
         
  All computer companies are technology companies first.   A repeated theme was that you can't be an entertainment company first. You are a technology company providing entertainment using technology. The tech can inform the entertainment side, the entertainment side drives features, but they really can't be separated. An awesome stack that does nothing is useless. A great idea on a poor stack is just as useless. There's a difficult balance that must be achieved and both management and developers must be aware that there's something to balance.  All pigs are equal .

<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case. Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on Fotolog in  Secrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success , which was one of my personal favorites.  Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding performance and scaling requirements. To meet those requirements they've developed a</p><p>5 0.10502602 <a title="584-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-26-PlentyOfFish_Architecture.html">638 high scalability-2009-06-26-PlentyOfFish Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 5 :  PlentyOfFish Update - 6 Billion Pageviews And 32 Billion Images A Month     Update 4 :  Jeff Atwood  costs out Markus' scale up approach against a scale out approach and finds scale up wanting. The discussion in the comments is as interesting as the article. My guess is Markus doesn't want to rewrite his software to work across a scale out cluster so even if it's more expensive scale up works better for his needs.   Update 3 :  POF now has 200 million images  and serves 10,000 images served per second. They'll be moving to a 250,000 IOPS RamSan to handle the load. Also upgraded to a core database machine with 512 GB of RAM, 32 CPU’s, SQLServer  2008 and Windows 2008.   Update 2 : This seems to be a  POF Peer1 love fest infomercial . It's pretty content free, but the production values are high. Lots of quirky sounds and fish swimming on the screen.  Update : by Facebook standards Read/WriteWeb says POF is worth a cool  one billion dollars .

<p>Introduction: Fotolog, a social blogging site centered around photos, grew from about 300 thousand users in 2004 to over 11 million users in 2007. Though they initially experienced the inevitable pains of rapid growth, they overcame their problems and now manage over 300 million photos and 800,000 new photos are added each day. Generating all that fabulous content are 20 million unique monthly visitors and a volunteer army of 30,000 new users each day. They did so well a very impressed suitor bought them out for a cool $90 million. That's scale meets success by anyone standards. How did they do it?

<p>Introduction: OK,     I know this site is for scalable web site design. But as there aren't any sites I can find for graceful failure under "slashdotted" like pressure I'll ask here.     Does anyone have a sensible way, once you have a "web application" that either won't scale, or can't scale, that you can give some users a good consistent experience and bounce other users to a busy site page. I have seen sites do this to varying degrees, some of which work better than others, but no explanations beyond simply bouncing requests to a "we're busy page server" when you have more than a given number of connections. This is obviously useless as a web page likely requires multiple connection (ignoring keep-alive, pipelining etc) multiple connection to completely render properly.     The normal problem is users getting a page and not the "furniture" for that page like images or css. Other problems are having to wait ages to get the busy page or the site being slow even if you do "get in". And some site let</p><p>5 0.70558351 <a title="584-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-31-Book%3A_Scalable_Internet_Architectures.html">51 high scalability-2007-07-31-Book: Scalable Internet Architectures</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As a developer, you are aware of the increasing concern amongst developers and site architects that websites be able to handle the vast number of visitors that flood the Internet on a daily basis. Scalable Internet Architecture addresses these concerns by teaching you both good and bad design methodologies for building new sites and how to scale existing websites to robust, high-availability websites. Primarily example-based, the book discusses major topics in web architectural design, presenting existing solutions and how they work. Technology budget tight? This book will work for you, too, as it introduces new and innovative concepts to solving traditionally expensive problems without a large technology budget. Using open source and proprietary examples, you will be engaged in best practice design methodologies for building new sites, as well as appropriately scaling both growing and shrinking sites.

<p>Introduction: ArchCamp: Scalable Databasess (NoSQL) 
 
The ArchCamp unconference was held this past Friday at HackerDojo in Mountain View, CA.  There was plenty of pizza, beer, and great conversation.  This session started out free-form, but shaped up pretty quickly into a discussion of the popular open source scalable NoSQL databases and the architectural categories in which they belong.</p><p>2 0.95556664 <a title="584-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-26-Should_you_use_a_SAN_to_scale_your_architecture%3F_.html">430 high scalability-2008-10-26-Should you use a SAN to scale your architecture? </a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a question everyone must struggle with when building out their datacenter. Storage choices are always the ones I have the least confidence in.  David Marks in his blog  You Can Change It Later!  asks the question   Should I get a SAN to scale my site architecture?   and answers no. A better solution is to use commodity hardware, directly attach storage on servers, and partition across servers to scale and for greater availability.  David's reasoning is interesting:
  A SAN creates a SPOF (single point of failure) that is dependent on a vendor to fly and fix when there's a problem. This can lead to long down times during this outage you have no access to your data at all.   Using easily available commodity hardware minimizes risks to your company, it's not just about saving money. Zooming over to Fry's to buy emergency equipment provides the kind of agility startups need in order to respond quickly to ever changing situations.

<p>Introduction: Hello all,     Reading the site you can note that "1 Master for writes, N Slaves for reads" scheme is used offen.     How is this implemented? Who decides where writes and reads go?

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Ali Khajeh-Hosseini , Technical Lead at  PlanForCloud . The original article was published  on their site . With 29 cloud price reductions I thought it would be interesting to see how the bottom line would change compared to an article  we published last year . The result is surprisingly little for TripAdvisor because prices for On Demand instances have  not dropped as fast  as for other other instances types. 
 
Over the last year and a half,  we counted 29 price reductions  in cloud services provided by AWS, Google Compute Engine, Windows Azure, and Rackspace Cloud. Price reductions have a direct effect on cloud users, but given the usual tiny reductions, how significant is that effect on the bottom line?
 
Last year I wrote about  cloud cost forecasts for TripAdvisor and Pinterest .  TripAdvisor was experimenting with AWS  and attempted to process 700K HTTP requests per minute on a replica of its live site, and  Pinterest was growing massively on AWS .

<p>Introduction: Planning your next buildout and thinking SSDs are still far in the future? Still too expensive, too low density. Hard disks are cheap, familiar, and store lots of stuff. In this short and entertaining video Wikia's  Artur Bergman  wants to change your mind about SSDs. SSDs are for today, get with the math already.
 
Here's Artur's logic:
  
 Wikia is all SSD in production. The new Wikia file servers have a theoretical read rate of ~10GB/sec sequential, 6GB/sec random and 1.2 million IOPs. If you can't do math or love the past, you love spinning rust. If you are awesome you love SSDs. 
 SSDs are cheaper than drives using the most relevant metric: $/GB/IOPS. 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS and one hard drive is 180 IOPS. Need 1 SSD instead of 50 hard drives. 
 With 8 million files there's a 9 minute fsck. Full backup in 12 minutes (X-25M based). 
 4 GB/sec random read average latency 1 msec. 
 2.2 GB/sec random write average latency 1 msec. 
 50TBs of SSDs in one machine for $80,000.

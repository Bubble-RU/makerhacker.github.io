<p>Introduction: Update 2:Sorting 1 PB with MapReduce. PB is not peanut-butter-and-jelly
misspelled. It's 1 petabyte or 1000 terabytes or 1,000,000 gigabytes.It took
six hours and two minutes to sort 1PB (10 trillion 100-byte records) on 4,000
computersand the results were replicated thrice on 48,000 disks.Update:Greg
Lindenpoints to a new Google articleMapReduce: simplified data processing on
large clusters. Some interesting stats: 100k MapReduce jobs are executed each
day; more than 20 petabytes of data are processed per day; more than 10k
MapReduce programs have been implemented; machines are dual processor with
gigabit ethernet and 4-8 GB of memory.Google is the King of scalability.
Everyone knows Google for their large, sophisticated, and fast searching, but
they don't just shine in search. Their platform approach to building scalable
applications allows them to roll out internet scale applications at an

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to

<p>Introduction: So far every massively scalable database is a bundle of compromises. For some
the weak guarantees of Amazon'seventual consistencymodel are too cold. For
many the strong guarantees of standard RDBMSdistributed transactionsare too

also trying to get is just right by offering per-record timeline consistency,
which hopes to serve up a heaping bowl ofrich database functionality and low
latency at massive scale:We describe PNUTS [Platform for Nimble Universal
Table Storage], a massively parallel and geographically distributed database
system for Yahoo!'s web applications. PNUTS provides data storage organized as
hashed or ordered tables, low latency for large numbers of con-current
requests including updates and queries, and novel per-record consistency

sufficient."From their website:Data is automatically replicated over multiple

<p>Introduction: Youmight haveconsistency problems if you have: multiple datastores in multiple
datacenters, without distributed transactions, and with the ability to
alternately execute out of each datacenter;  syncing protocols that can fail
or sync stale data; distributed clients that cache data and then write old
back to the central store; a NoSQL database that doesn't have transactions
between updates of multiple related key-value records; application level
integrity checks; client drivenoptimistic locking.Sounds a lot like many
evolving, loosely coupled, autonomous, distributed systems these days. How do
you solve these consistency problems? Siddharth "Sid" Anand of Netflix talks
about how they solved theirs in his excellent presentation, NoSQL @ Netflix :
Part 1, given to a packed crowd at aCloud Computing Meetup. You might be
inclined to say how silly it is to have these problems in the first place, but

<p>Introduction: What do you get when you take a SQL database and start a new implementation
from scratch, taking advantage of the latest research and modern hardware?
Mike Stonebraker, the sword wielding Johnny Appleseed of the database world,
hopes you get something like his new database,VoltDB: a pure SQL, pure ACID,
pure OLTP, shared nothing, sharded, scalable, lockless, open source, in-memory
DBMS, purpose-built for running hundreds of thousands of transactions a
second. VoltDBclaims to be100 times faster than MySQL, up to 13 times faster
thanCassandra, and 45 times faster than Oracle, with near-linear scaling.Will
VoltDB kill off the new NoSQL upstarts? Will VoltDB cause a mass extinction of
ancient databases? Probably no and no to both questions, but it's a product
with a definite point-of-view and is worth a look as the transaction component
in your system. But will it be right for you? Let's see...I first heard the
details about VoltDB at Gluecon, where Mr. Stonebraker presented his highly

<p>Introduction: The abstract for the talk given by Bob Ippolito, co-founder and CTO of Mochi
Media, Inc:Building large systems on top of a traditional single-master RDBMS
data storage layer is no longer good enough. This talk explores the landscape
of new technologies available today to augment your data layer to improve
performance and reliability. Is your application a good fit for caches, bloom
filters, bitmap indexes, column stores, distributed key/value stores, or
document databases? Learn how they work (in theory and practice) and decide
for yourself.Bob does an excellent job highlighting different products and the
key concepts to understand when pondering the wide variety of new database
offerings. It's unlikely you'll be able to say oh, this is the database for me
after watching the presentation, but you will be much better informed on your
options. And I imagine slightly confused as to what to do :-)An interesting
observation in the talk is that the more robust products are internal to large</p><p>4 0.97936362 <a title="589-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-09-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_9%2C_2012.html">1206 high scalability-2012-03-09-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 9, 2012</a></p>

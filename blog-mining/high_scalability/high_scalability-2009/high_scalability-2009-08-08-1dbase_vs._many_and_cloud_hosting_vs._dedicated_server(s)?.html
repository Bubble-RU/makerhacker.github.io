<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byIvan de PradoandPere Ferrera, founders ofDatasalt, the
company behindPangoolandSplout SQLBig Data open-source projects.The amount of
payments performed using credit cards is huge. It is clear that there is
inherent value in the data that can be derived from analyzing all the
transactions. Client fidelity, demographics, heat maps of activity, shop
recommendations, and many other statistics are useful to both clients and
shops for improving their relationship with the market. AtDatasaltwe have
developed a system in collaboration with theBBVA bankthat is able to analyze
years of data and serve insights and statistics to different low-latency web
and mobile applications.The main challenge we faced besides processing Big
Data input is thatthe output was also Big Data, and even bigger than the
input. And this output needed to be served quickly, under high load.The
solution we developed has an infrastructure cost of just a few thousands of
dollars per month thanks to th</p><p>3 0.098864928 <a title="675-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-12-a8cjdbc_-_Database_Clustering_via_JDBC.html">151 high scalability-2007-11-12-a8cjdbc - Database Clustering via JDBC</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Practically any software project nowadays could not survive without a database
(DBMS) backend storing all the business data that is vital to you and/or your
customers. When projects grow larger, the amount of data usually grows larger
exponentially. So you start moving the DBMS to a separate server to gain more
speed and capacity. Which is all good and healthy but you do not gain any
extra safety for this business data. You might be backing up your database
once a day so in case the database server crashes you don't lose EVERYTHING,
but how much can you really afford to lose? Well clearly this depends on what
kind of data you are storing. In our case the users of our solutions use our
software products to do their everyday (all day) work. They have "everything"
they need for their business stored in the database we are providing. So is 24
hours of data loss acceptable? No, not really. One hour? Maybe. But what we
really want is a second database running with the EXACT same data. We mos</p><p>4 0.092769392 <a title="675-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-08-Google_AppEngine_-_A_First_Look.html">301 high scalability-2008-04-08-Google AppEngine - A First Look</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I haven't developed an AppEngine application yet, I'm just taking a look
around their documentation and seeing what stands out for me. It's not the
much speculatedsuper cluster VM. AppEngine is solidly grounded in code and
structure. It reminds me a little of the guy who ran awebsite out of S3with a
splash ofHerokuthrown in as a chaser.The idea is clearly to take advantage of
ourmassive multi-core futureby creating a shared nothing infrastructure based
firmly on a core set of infinitely scalable database, storage and CPU
services. Don't forget Google also has a few other services to leverage:
email, login, blogs, video, search, ads, metrics, and apps. A shared nothing
request is a simple beast. By its very nature shared nothing architectures
must be composed of services which are themselves already scalable and Google
is signing up to supply that scalable infrastructure. Google has been busy
creating a platform of out-of-the-box scalable services to build on. Now they

<p>Introduction: Hi there,I have an idea for an online database that services a large number of
people. I've been studying it for a while and it seems feasible to me to
create it and get people to populate it. It will need time to grow but
eventually it will get there.The model I'm looking at is IMDB, the depth of
information is fascinating, yet it's fast, not so easy to use though, but it's
pretty usable!What do you think I need to create a database an online database
like IMDB. I know that IMDB power comes from it's information, not the design
of the site. This is something I kind of figured out.But what I need to know
is the best tools to publish database contents on the web, retrieve it in that
fast way like IMDB. I'm sure that I will need to create data entry logs for my
users to populate the database.What programming languages you suggest?
development environment? approaches?your contribution is highly
appreciated.Regards,Jalil</p><p>3 0.81168973 <a title="675-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-25-Application_Database_and_DAL_Architecture.html">222 high scalability-2008-01-25-Application Database and DAL Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi gurus, I'm totally new to this high scalability thing. I'm trying to create
a website with scalability in mind (personal project). In my application I'll
have forums for different groups of people (each group will have their own
forums, members of groups can still post in other groups' forums but each
group will mainly be using their forums most of the time). Now, I'm going to
start with about 2000 groups with the potential of reaching up to 10000 groups
(this is the maximum due to the nature of my application). I was thinking that
having all posts in one table will be way too much for one table (esp. that
some groups are expected to post hundreds or even thousands times per day,
let's say about 500 of the groups, the rest of the groups won't be that active
though) as I'll have to index the PostID, ParentPostID, GroupID and PostDate
which can produce large indexes (consequentially causing slow inserts) if
having everything in one table. So, I'm thinking of a way to divide the posts</p><p>4 0.80851942 <a title="675-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-23-Ask_HighScalability%3A_How_Do_I_Build_My_MegaUpload_%2B_Itunes_%2B_YouTube_Startup%3F.html">1288 high scalability-2012-07-23-Ask HighScalability: How Do I Build My MegaUpload + Itunes + YouTube Startup?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This question was sent in by Val, who asking for a little help in creating the
next big thing. Any ideas?I'm planning to run my own, first startup website
and have been surfing the webs for relevant info to plan the technology I will
use for it (the frontend and the backend, including the software and the
hardware). The website will be something like a combination of:MegaUpload
(users will upload their files)iTunes (users will be paid for their
uploads)and YouTube (in the future I'm planning to let users watch/listen to
the content online, without downloading).I don't have any investors yet, nor
the budget - I'm still preparing the idea and I'm going to create first
implementation (an "alpha version") before I show it to potential investors.
Hence the initial technologies have to be extremely cheap *but* also highly
scalable in the future so that I don't have to redo anything when the website
grows.Unfortunately I don't have much experience in running big wesites but,
on the other hand</p><p>5 0.75941539 <a title="675-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-30-The_case_for_functional_decomposition.html">435 high scalability-2008-10-30-The case for functional decomposition</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi all,I'm a big fan of http://highscalability.com/ and have been looking in
my current development to decompose my application along functional boundaries
as a route to being able to scale out the server side, specifically the
database layer. The problem comes when there are links between the data in
different components, ie one component holds all the user data, but another
component needs to reference a user as being an owner of some piece of data.
I'm currently doing this by holding the primary key information for each side
of the the link (as you would if they all lived in a single database), but
this link table needs to exist in both components to allow lookups to be done
in either direction, ie 'get the things a specific user owns' and 'get the
owners of this specific thing' would each use different components. The
alternative to this would be to store the link data in only one of the
components, but then the reverse lookups would require 2 calls instead of just
one.My question</p><p>6 0.72692519 <a title="675-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-04-Database_question_for_upcoming_project.html">379 high scalability-2008-09-04-Database question for upcoming project</a></p>

<p>Introduction: BeforeWe started with a small site, a mess of open source, and a small team
that didn't know much about scaling.AfterWe ended with a large site, a medium
sized team, and an architecture that has scaled.We never stopped. We used a
roadmap and a compass, made weekly changes in direction, regularly shipped
code on Wednesday to handle the next weekend's capacity constraints, and
shipped new features the whole time.These are excerpts from the IMVU PDF
presentation of their architecture which can be viewed or
downloadedhere.IMVUis an online destination where adults and teens meet new
people in 3D. IMVU won the 2008 Virtual Worlds Innovation Award and was also
named a Rising Star in the 2008 Silicon Valley Technology Fast 50 program.</p><p>2 0.98899996 <a title="675-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-24-INFOSCALE_2009_in_June_in_Hong_Kong.html">580 high scalability-2009-04-24-INFOSCALE 2009 in June in Hong Kong</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In case you are interested here's the info:INFOSCALE 2009: The 4th
International ICST Conference on Scalable Information Systems. 10-12 June
2009, Hong Kong, China.In the last few years, we have seen the proliferation
of the use of heterogeneous distributed systems, ranging from simple Networks
of Workstations, to highly complex grid computing environments. Such
computational paradigms have been preferred due to their reduced costs and
inherent scalability, which pose many challenges to scalable systems and
applications in terms of information access, storage and retrieval.Grid
computing, P2P technology, data and knowledge bases, distributed information
retrieval technology and networking technology should all converge to address
the scalability concern. Furthermore, with the advent of emerging computing
architectures - e.g. SMTs, GPUs, Multicores. - the importance of designing
techniques explicitly targeting these systems is becoming more and more
important.INFOSCALE 2009 will focus o</p><p>3 0.98827422 <a title="675-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-13-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Facing_scaling_issues_with_news_feeds_on_Redis.__Any_advice%3F.html">1303 high scalability-2012-08-13-Ask HighScalability: Facing scaling issues with news feeds on Redis.  Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are
already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.We're basically using
a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and
topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on
Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store
to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget).
Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text,
author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.I'm wondering if
we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store
the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback
here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to
retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just
post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to get the r</p><p>4 0.98612165 <a title="675-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-26-Performance_-_When_do_I_start_worrying%3F.html">549 high scalability-2009-03-26-Performance - When do I start worrying?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A common problem of the application designers is to predict when they need to
start worrying about the Architectural/System improvements on their
application. Do I need to add more resources? If yes, then how long before I
am compelled to do so? The question is not only when but also what. Should I
plan to implement a true caching layer on top of my application or do I need
to shard my database. Do I need to move to a distributed search infrastructure
and if yes when ! Essentially we try to find out the functionalities of the
application that will become critical over time.</p><p>5 0.9827916 <a title="675-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-28-DR-BC_for_web-DB_servers.html">226 high scalability-2008-01-28-DR-BC for web-DB servers</a></p>

sclability for my web/db servers. I came across VMWare Infrastructure and
other products. The I/O performance concerns me to go with virtual servers.
I'm also looking into imaging software such as Acrnois.Could anyone share
their thoughts on how it's being done with bigger names such as google/youtube

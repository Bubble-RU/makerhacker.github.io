<p>Introduction: Learned lessons from the largest player (Flickr, YouTube, Google, etc)     I would like to write today about some learned lessons from the biggest player in the high Scalable Web application. I will divide the lessons into 4 points:         * Start slow, and small, and measuring the right thing.       * Vertical Scalability vs. Horizontal Scalability.       * Every problem has its own solution.       * General learned lesson      Read more</p><p>3 0.13106914 <a title="646-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-12-High_Performance_at_Massive_Scale_%E2%80%93__Lessons_learned_at_Facebook.html">720 high scalability-2009-10-12-High Performance at Massive Scale –  Lessons learned at Facebook</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of Technology at Facebook gave a great presentation at UC San Diego on our favorite subject: " High Performance at Massive Scale –  Lessons learned at Facebook ". The abstract for the talk is:
  

Facebook has grown into one of the largest sites on the Internet today serving over 200 billion pages per month. The nature of social data makes engineering a site for this level of scale a particularly challenging proposition. In this presentation, I will discuss the aspects of social data that present challenges for scalability and will describe the the core architectural components and design principles that Facebook has used to address these challenges. In addition, I will discuss emerging technologies that offer new opportunities for building cost-effective high performance web architectures.

  
There's a lot of interesting about this talk that we'll get into  later, but I thought you might want a head start on learning how Facebook handles 30K+ machines,</p><p>4 0.10723908 <a title="646-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-23-This_stuff_isn%27t_taught%2C_you_learn_it_bit_by_bit_as_you_solve_each_problem..html">994 high scalability-2011-02-23-This stuff isn't taught, you learn it bit by bit as you solve each problem.</a></p>

A really nice Internet moment happened in the HackerNews thread  Disqus: Scaling the World’s Largest Django Application , when David Kitchen crafted an awesome response  to a question  about how you learn to build scalable systems. It's so good I thought I would reproduce it here.
 
  Question  :   asked   by    grovulent :
 
  Not like this is a problem I have to worry about. But where on earth does one learn this stuff?   The talk is useful - as an overview of what they use - but I know nothing of how to implement a single step.  
 
  Answer  : answered by  David Kitchen  of  buro9 :
 
 It's called experience.  
 
 Which perhaps sounds rude, but it's not meant to be. 
 
   
 
 This stuff isn't taught per se, you learn it bit by bit as you solve each problem that you face. 
 
   
 
 I learned about HAProxy when my site load exceeded that which a single web server could manage.</p><p>5 0.10640207 <a title="646-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-19-Conference%3A_Infoscale_2008_in_Italy_%28June_4-6%29.html">322 high scalability-2008-05-19-Conference: Infoscale 2008 in Italy (June 4-6)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 2:  Presentation from the  NoSQL conference :  slides ,  video .  Update:   Why you won't be building your killer app on a distributed hash table  by Jonathan Ellis.  Why I think Cassandra is the most promising of the open-source distributed databases --you get a relatively rich data model and a distribution model that supports efficient range queries. These are not things that can be grafted on top of a simpler DHT foundation, so Cassandra will be useful for a wider variety of applications.    James Hamilton has published a thorough summary of Facebook's Cassandra, another scalable key-value store for your perusal. It's open source and is described as a "BigTable data model running on a Dynamo-like infrastructure." Cassandra is used in Facebook as an email search system containing 25TB and over 100m mailboxes.

<p>Introduction: This scalability strategy is brought to you by Erik Osterman:   My recommendations for anyone dealing with explosive growth on a limited budget with lots of cachable content (e.g. content capable of returning valid expiration headers) is employ a    reverse proxy    as mentioned in this article.   In the last week, we had a site get AP'd, triggering 100K unique visitors to a single IIS server in under 5 hours. It took out the IIS server. Placing a single squid infront of the server handled the entire onslaught with a max server load of 0.10 on a modest Intel IV 3Ghz.  It's trivial to implement for anyone interested...</p><p>2 0.83954871 <a title="646-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome_List_of_Advanced_Distributed_Systems_Papers.html">1049 high scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome List of Advanced Distributed Systems Papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As part of  Dr. Indranil Gupta 's  CS 525 Spring 2011 Advanced Distributed Systems  class, he has collected an incredible  list of resources on distributed systems . His  research group  is also doing some interesting work.
 
The  various topics  include: Before there Were Clouds, Cloud Computing, P2P Systems, Basic Distributed Computing Concepts, Sensor Networks, Overlays and DHTs, Cloud Programming, Cloud Scheduling, Key-Value Stores, Storage, Sensor Net Routing, Geo-Distribution, P2P Apps, In-network processing, Epidemics, Probabilistic Membership Protocols, Distributed Monitoring and  Management, Publish-Subscribe/CDNs, Measurement Studies, Old Wine: Stale or Vintage?, In Byzantium, Cloud Pricing, Other Industrial Systems, Structure of Networks, Completing the Circle, Green Clouds, Distributed Debugging, Flash!, The Middle or the End?, Availability-Aware Systems, Design Methodologies, Handling Stress, Sources of unreliability in networks, Handling Stress, Selfish algorithms, Securi</p><p>3 0.8259666 <a title="646-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-23-Synchronizing_Memcached_application.html">191 high scalability-2007-12-23-Synchronizing Memcached application</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have an application with couple of web servers that uses MemcacheD. How can i synchronize concurrent put to the cache? The value of the entry  is list.     Atomic append operation could have been helpful, but unfortunately memcahe doesn't support atomic append.</p><p>4 0.75497532 <a title="646-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-27-Product%3A_Sequoia_Database_Clustering_Technology.html">102 high scalability-2007-09-27-Product: Sequoia Database Clustering Technology</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sequoia  is a transparent middleware solution offering clustering, load balancing and failover services for any database. Sequoia is the continuation of the C-JDBC project. The database is distributed and replicated among several nodes and Sequoia balances the queries among these nodes. Sequoia handles node and network failures with transparent failover. It also provides support for hot recovery, online maintenance operations and online upgrades.
  Features in a nutshell    No modification of existing applications or databases.    Operational with any database providing a JDBC driver.    High availability provided by advanced RAIDb technology.    Transparent failover and recovery capabilities.    Performance scalability with unique load balancing and query result caching features.    Integrated JMX-based administration and monitoring.    100% Java implementation allowing portability across platforms with a JRE 1.4 or greater.    Open source licensed under Apache v2 license.

<p>Introduction: How would you architect and implement an SD and HD internet video delivery system such as the BBC iPlayer or   Recast Digital's RDV1  . What do you need to consider on top of the Lessons Learned section in the   YouTube Architecture   post?     How is it possible to compete with the big players like Google? Can you just use a CDN and scale efficiently? Would Amazon's cloud services be a viable platform for high-definition video streaming?</p><p>6 0.73892045 <a title="646-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-06-Product%3A_ChironFS.html">143 high scalability-2007-11-06-Product: ChironFS</a></p>

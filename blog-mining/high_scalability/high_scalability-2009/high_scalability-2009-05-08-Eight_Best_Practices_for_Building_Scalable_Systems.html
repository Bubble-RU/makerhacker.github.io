<p>Introduction: For solutions take a look at:7 Life Saving Scalability Defenses Against Load
Monster Attacks.This is a look at all the bad things that can happen to your
carefully crafted program as loads increase: all hell breaks lose. Sure, you
can scale out or scale up, but you can also choose to program better. Make
your system handle larger loads. This saves money because fewer boxes are
needed and it will make the entire application more reliable and have better
response times. And it can be quite satisfying as a programmer.Large Number Of
ObjectsWe usually get into scaling problems when the number of objects gets
larger. Clearly resource usage of all types is stressed as the number of
objects grow.Continuous Failures Makes An Infinite Event StreamDuring large
network failure scenarios there is never time for the system recover. We are
in a continual state of stress.Lots of High Priority WorkFor example,
rerouting is a high priority activity. If there is a large amount of rerouting

<p>Introduction: In 5 Lessons We've Learned Using AWS, Netflix's John Ciancutti says one of the
big lessons they've learned is to create lesschatty protocols:In the Netflix
data centers, we have a high capacity, super fast, highly reliable network.
This has afforded us the luxury of designing around chatty APIs to remote
systems. AWS networking has more variable latency. We've had to be much more
structured about "over the wire" interactions, even as we've transitioned to a
more highly distributed architecture.There's not a lot of advice out there on
how to create protocols. Combine that with a rush to the cloud and you have a
perfect storm for chatty applications crushing application performance.
Netflix is far from the first to be surprised by the less than stellar
networks inside AWS. A chatty protocol is one where a client makes a series of
requests to a server and the client must wait on each reply before sending the
next request. On a LAN this can work great. LAN's are typically fast, wide,

whatMartin Kleppmannhas done in an lovingly written Six things I wish we had

<p>Introduction: Now that we have theC10K concurrent connection problemlicked, how do we level
up and support 10 million concurrent connections? Impossible you say. Nope,
systems right now are delivering 10 million concurrent connections using
techniques that are as radical as they may be unfamiliar.To learn how it's
done we turn toRobert Graham, CEO of Errata Security, and his absolutely
fantastic talk atShmoocon 2013calledC10M Defending The Internet At
Scale.Robert has a brilliant way of framing the problem that I've never heard
of before. He starts with a little bit of history, relating how Unix wasn't
originally designed to be a general server OS, it was designed to be a control
system for a telephone network. It was the telephone network that actually
transported the data so there was a clean separation between the control plane
and the data plane. Theproblem is we now use Unix servers as part of the data
plane, which we shouldn't do at all. If we were designing a kernel for
handling one applicati</p><p>6 0.084153458 <a title="594-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-02-Strategy%3A_How_to_Manage_Sessions_Using_Memcached.html">436 high scalability-2008-11-02-Strategy: How to Manage Sessions Using Memcached</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:AsynchronousHTTP cache validations. A proposed HTTP caching
extension:if your application can afford to show slightly out of date content,
then stale-while-revalidate can guarantee that the user will always be served
directly from the cache, hence guaranteeing a consistent response-time user-
experience.Caching is like aspirin for headaches. Head hurts: pop a 'sprin.
Slow site: add caching.Facebookmust have a lot of headaches because they
popped 805 memcached servers between 10,000 web servers and 1,800 MySQL
servers and they reportedly have a 99% cache hit rate. But what's the best way
for you to cache for your application? It's a remarkably complex and rich
topic. Alexey Kovyrin talks about one common caching problem called theDog
PileEffectinDog-pile Effect and How to Avoid it with Ruby on Rails. Glenn
Franxman also has a Django solution inMintCache.Data is usually cached because
it's too expensive to calculate for every hit. Maybe it's a gnarly SQL query

<p>Introduction: Tugela Cacheis a cache system like memecached, but instead of storing data
just in RAM, it stores data in the file system using a b-tree. You trade
latency in order to have a very large cache. It's useful for sites that have
caching requirements that exceed their available memory. It uses the same wire
protocol asmemcachedso it can be dropped in without a hassle. From the
website:As large MediaWiki deployments may gain performance using Memcached,
at some level cost of RAM to store all objects becomes too high. In order to
balance resource usage and make more use of our Apache server disks, Tugela,
the distributed cached on-disk hash database, has arrived.Tugela Cache is
derived from Memcached. Much of the code remains the same, but notably, these
changes:Internal slab allocator replaced by BerkeleyDB B-Tree database.Expiry
policy management moved to external program tugela-expireMuch statistics code
made obsolete.An interesting point brought up in the comments is using

<p>Introduction: We talked about 42 Monster Problems That Attack As Loads Increase. And inThe
Aggregation Collection we talked about the value of prioritizing work and
making smart queues as a way of absorbing and not reflecting traffic
spikes.Now we move on to our next batch of strategies where the theme
isconditioning, which is the idea of shaping and controlling flows of work
within your application...Use Resources Proportional To a Fixed LimitThis is
probably the most important rule for achieving scalability within an
application. What it means:Find the resource that has a fixed limit that you
know you can support. For example, a guarantee to handle a certain number of
objects in memory. So if we always use resources proportional to the number of
objects it is likely we can prevent resource exhaustion.Devise ways of tying
what you need to do to the individual resources.Some examples:Keep a list of
purchase orders with line items over $20 (or whatever). Do not keep a list of
the line items because t</p><p>5 0.68903375 <a title="594-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-16-Six_Lessons_Learned_the_Hard_Way_About_Scaling_a_Million_User_System_.html">1633 high scalability-2014-04-16-Six Lessons Learned the Hard Way About Scaling a Million User System </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Wille Faler hascreated an excellent list of best practicesfor building
scalable and high performance systems. Here's a short summary of his
points:Offload the database- Avoid hitting the database, and avoid opening
transactions or connections unless you absolutely need to use them.What a
difference a cache makes- For read heavy applications caching is the easiest
way offload the database.Cache as coarse-grained objects as possible- Coarse-
grained objects save CPU and time by requiring fewer reads to assemble
objects.Don't store transient state permanently- Is it really necessary to
store your transient data in the database?Location, Location- put things close
to where they are supposed to be delivered.Constrain concurrent access to
limited resource- it's quicker to let a single thread do work and finish
rather than flooding finite resources with 200 client threads.Staged,
asynchronous processing- separate a process using asynchronicity into separate
steps mediated by queues and execut</p><p>2 0.99455851 <a title="594-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-12-Strategy%3A_Terminate_SSL_Connections_in_Hardware_and_Reduce_Server_Count_by_40%25.html">878 high scalability-2010-08-12-Strategy: Terminate SSL Connections in Hardware and Reduce Server Count by 40%</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an interesting tidbit from near the end of the Packet Pushers
podcastShow 15 - Saving the Web With Dinky Putt Putt Firewalls. The
conversation was about how SSL connections need to terminate before they can
be processed by a WAF (Web Application Firewall), which inspects HTTP for
security problems like SQL injection and cross-site scripting exploits. Much
was made that if programmers did their job better these appliances wouldn't be
necessary, but I digress.Toterminate SSLmost shops run SSL connections into
Intel based Linux boxes running Apache. This setup is convenient for
developers, but it's not optimized for SSL, so it's slow and costly. Much of
the capacity of these servers are unnecessarily consumed processing SSL.Load
balancers on the other hand have crypto cards that terminate SSL very
efficiently in hardware. Efficiently enough that if you are willing to get rid
of the general purpose Linux boxes and use your big iron load balancers, your
server count can be decreased</p><p>3 0.99412024 <a title="594-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-30-More_Troubles_with_Caching.html">911 high scalability-2010-09-30-More Troubles with Caching</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As a tasty pairing withFacebook And Site Failures Caused By Complex, Weakly
Interacting, Layered Systems, is another excellent tale of caching gone wrong
by Peter Zaitsev, in an exciting twin billing:Cache Miss Stormand More on
dangers of the caches. This is fascinating case where the cause turned out to
be software upgrade that ran long because it had to be rolled back. During the
long recovery time many of the cache entries timed out. When the database came
back, slam, all the clients queried the database to repopulate the cache and
bad things happened to the database. The solution was equally interesting: So
the immediate solution to bring the system up was surprisingly simple. We just
had to get traffic on the system in stages allowing Memcache to be warmed up.
There were no code which would allow to do it on application side so we did it
on MySQL side instead. "SET GLOBAL max_connections=20" to limit number of
connections to MySQL and so let application to err when it tries to put</p><p>4 0.99298233 <a title="594-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-04-Strategy%3A_Cache_Larger_Chunks_-_Cache_Hit_Rate_is_a_Bad_Indicator.html">836 high scalability-2010-06-04-Strategy: Cache Larger Chunks - Cache Hit Rate is a Bad Indicator</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Isn't the secret to fast, scalable websites tocache everything? Caching, if
not thesecret sauceof many a website, is it at least a popular condiment. But
not so fast says Peter Zaitsev inBeyond great cache hit ratio. The point Peter
makes is that we read about websites likeAmazonandFacebook that can literally
make hundreds of calls to satisfy a user request. Even if you have an awesome
cache hit ratio, pages can still be slow because making and processing all
those requests takes time. The solution is toremove requests all together. You
do this bycaching larger blocksso you have to make fewer requests. The post
has a lot of good advice worth reading: 1) Make non cacheable blocks as small
as possible, 2) Maximize amount of uses of the cache item, 3) Control
invalidation, 4) Multi-Get.</p><p>5 0.99273366 <a title="594-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-25-Google%3A_Introduction_to_Distributed_System_Design.html">223 high scalability-2008-01-25-Google: Introduction to Distributed System Design</a></p>

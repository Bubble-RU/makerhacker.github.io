<p>Introduction: With so many database options available these days, like for the rest of life, it's natural to wonder how it all  fits together . Amazon complicated, or rather expanded the available options by introducing RDS, their  relational database service . RDS is MySQL safely cocooned as a manageable cloud element, resting boldly within an energy providing elastic  CPU pool , supported by a virtually  infinite supply  of very  capable virtualized storage  .
 
MySQL in AWS is  now easy  to start, stop, monitor, backup, snapshot, expand, and effortlessly move up and down the instance hierarchy. What it's not, contrary to what you might expect, is a scale-out solution, it's a scale-up solution. You get more by buying a bigger instance, not by horizontally adding more instances. There's a  limit . Admittedly a larger limit now with Amazon's new  high memory instances .
 
That's OK, well maybe not for people who helped grow Amazon's ecosystem by offering a similar product, but so many projects use M</p><p>3 0.16180231 <a title="737-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-05-Anti-RDBMS%3A_A_list_of_distributed_key-value_stores.html">670 high scalability-2009-08-05-Anti-RDBMS: A list of distributed key-value stores</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Doug Judd , original creator of Hypertable and the CEO of Hypertable, Inc. 
 
 Hypertable delivers 2X better throughput in most tests -- HBase fails 41 and 167 billion record insert tests, overwhelmed by garbage collection -- Both systems deliver similar results for random read uniform test 
 
We recently conducted a test comparing the performance of Hypertable ( @hypertable ) version 0.9.5.5 to that of HBase ( @HBase ) version 0.90.4 (CDH3u2) running Zookeeper 3.3.4.  In this post, we summarize the results and offer explanations for the discrepancies. For the full test report, see  Hypertable vs. HBase II .
  Introduction  
Hypertable and HBase are both open source, scalable databases modeled after Google's proprietary Bigtable database.  The primary difference between the two systems is that Hypertable is written in C++, while HBase is written in Java.  We modeled this test after the one described in section 7 of the  Bigtable paper  and tuned both systems fo</p><p>5 0.11752261 <a title="737-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-28-Notes_from_A_NOSQL_Evening_in_Palo_Alto_.html">931 high scalability-2010-10-28-Notes from A NOSQL Evening in Palo Alto </a></p>
<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors, attended the  A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto  NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid, InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came from the audience, which was refreshing. 
 
Overall a genial evening with some good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that was really the purpose of this kind of talk. The panel format is excellent at giving a wide ra</p><p>6 0.113566 <a title="737-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-09-10_NoSQL_Systems_Reviewed.html">739 high scalability-2009-11-09-10 NoSQL Systems Reviewed</a></p>

<p>Introduction: NoSQL is a trend that is gaining steam primarily in the world of Open Source. There are numerous NoSQL solutions available for all levels of complexity: from queryable distributed solutions like MongoDB to simpler distributed key-value storage solutions like Cassandra. Then there’s Riak, Tokyo Cabinet, Voldemort, CouchDB, and Redis. However, very few of these packaged NoSQL products are available for the other end of the platform market: Microsoft Windows. I’m going to outline what’s available now and briefly touch on some opportunities that are still available to the daring Microsoft engineer.

<p>Introduction: I’ve largely steered clear of publicly commenting on the “NoSQL vs. Relational” conflict. Keeping in mind that this argument is more about currently available solutions and the features their developers have chosen to build in, I’d like to dig into this and provide a decidedly neutral viewpoint. In fact, by erring on the side of caution, I’ve inadvertently given myself plenty of time to consider the pros and cons of both data storage approaches, and although my mind was initially swaying toward the NoSQL camp, I can say with a fair amount of certainty, that I’ve found a good compromise.

<p>Introduction: Forrester released their new wave report:  T he Forrester Wave™: Elastic Caching Platforms, Q2 2010  where they listed GigaSpaces, IBM, Oracle, and Terracotta as leading vendors in the field. In this post I'd like to take some time to explain what some of these terms mean, and why they’re important to you. I’ll start with a definition of Elastic Data Grid (Elastic Caching), how it is different then other caching and NoSQL alternatives, and more importantly -- I'll illustrate how it works through some real code examples.

<p>Introduction: NorthScale's Steven Yen in his highly entertaining  NoSQL is a Horseless Carriage  presentation has come up with a NoSQL taxonomy that thankfully focuses a little more on what NoSQL is, than  what it isn't :
  
 key‐value‐cache    
 
 memcached, repcached, coherence, infinispan, eXtreme scale, jboss cache, velocity, terracoqa 
 
 
  key‐value‐store

 eventually‐consistent key‐value‐store    
 
 dynamo, voldemort, Dynomite, SubRecord, Mo8onDb, Dovetaildb 
 
 
 ordered‐key‐value‐store    
 
 tokyo tyrant, lightcloud, NMDB, luxio, memcachedb, actord

<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see how!     Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed in a format called   Alexandrian form which draws on constructs used by Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:     The pattern name   The problem the pattern is trying to solve     Context   Solution   Examples   Design rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why experts use it       Patterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context, and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next ‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied. A pattern language is a structured col</p><p>4 0.61167949 <a title="737-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-01-Squeeze_more_performance_from_Parallelism.html">735 high scalability-2009-11-01-Squeeze more performance from Parallelism</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In many posts, such as:  The Future of the Parallelism and its Challenges  I mentioned that synchronization the access to the shared resource is the major challenge to write parallel code.
 
The synchronization and coordination take long time from the overall execution time, which reduce the benefits of the parallelism; the synchronization and coordination also reduce the scalability.
 
There are many forms of synchronization and coordination, such as:
  
 Create Task object in frameworks such as: Microsoft TPL, Intel TDD, and Parallel Runtime Library. Create and enqueue task objects require synchronization that it’s takes long time especially if we create it into recursive work such as: Quick Sort algorithm. 
 Synchronization the access to shared data. 
  
But there are a few techniques to avoid these issues, such as: Shared-Nothing, Actor Model, and Hyper Object (A.K.A. Combinable Object). Simply if we reduce the shared data by re-architect our code this will gives us a huge benefits</p><p>5 0.60131663 <a title="737-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-17-WebSphere_Commerce_High_Availability_and_Performance_Configurations.html">321 high scalability-2008-05-17-WebSphere Commerce High Availability and Performance Configurations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nobody came up with an example of a website powered by a Websphere product (which has a community edition) and backed up by a DB2 database.     I guess you all know about usopen.org so here's the story:       While the re-emergence of 35-year-old Andre Agassi and the continued dominance of wunderkind Maria Sharapova have highlighted the on-court headlines at this year's U.S. Open Tennis Championships in Flushing Meadows, N.Y., IBM is hoping its new Power5 chip-based IT support for USOpen.org can make news among those more interested in .NET than tennis nets.     Big Blue has partnered with the U.S. Tennis Association and the U.S. Open -- the most prestigious tennis tournament in the U.S. -- since 1992. Together, they launched USOpen.org in 1995 so racket heads could follow the matches online.     The iSeries' role this year is in powering a Web-based end-user application called "Point Tracker," a graphics tool using autonomic technology that recreates the trajectory of every shot.

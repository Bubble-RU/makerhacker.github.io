<p>Introduction: We are serving dynamic (PHP) websites and their assets (JS/CSS/images/videos/binary downloads) via the same apache hosts. The static files are only being used as origins for CDN services used to distribute those files. Yet, in the current development-deploy pipeline, these files are checked into the same version control repositories as the code is. This is what we would like to change, for several reasons (decouple asset deployment from development & developers, lessen size of code repositories, etc.)
 
My idea is to do the following: Set up a media server (cluster) which serves as an API (REST e.g.). You can PUT files to it, and get back the URL the file is available through from the public. In between input and output, the media service deals with everything that's necessary to serve the files: Upload them to the CDN, create the public URL, write the meta data to a (relational?) database, assign a version number... This API can be used by a) the application/website directly to provid</p><p>4 0.68495041 <a title="605-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-18-Shared_filesystem_on_EC2.html">283 high scalability-2008-03-18-Shared filesystem on EC2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi. I'm looking for a way to share files between EC2 nodes. Currently we are using glusterfs to do this. It has been reliable recently, but in the past it has crashed under high load and we've had trouble starting it up again. We've only been able to restart it by removing the files, restarting the cluster, and filing it up again with our files from backup. This takes ages, and will take even longer the more files we get.     What worries me is that it seems to make each node a point of failure for the entire system. One node crashes and soon the entire cluster has crashed. The other problem is adding another node. It seems like you have to take down the whole thing, reconfigure to include the new node, and restart. This kind of defeats the horizontal scaling strategy.      We are using 2 EC2 instances as web servers, 1 as a DB master, and 1 as a slave. GlusterFS is installed on the web server machines as well as the DB slave machine (we backup files to s3 from this machine). The files</p><p>5 0.65663368 <a title="605-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-18-Sync_data_on_all_servers.html">98 high scalability-2007-09-18-Sync data on all servers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes configurations in detail using Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers with a Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200 M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the switches.     These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are only available through Sun's factory integration.

<p>Introduction: I am looking for a way to distribute files over servers in different physical locations. My main concern is that I have bandwidth limitations on each location, and wish to spread the bandwidth load evenly. Atm. I just have 1:1 copies of the files on all servers, and have the application pick a random server to serve the file as a temp fix...     It's a small video streaming service. I want to spoonfeed the stream to the client with a max bandwidth output, and support seek. At present I use php to limit the network stream, and read the file at a given offset sendt as a get parameter from the player for seek. It's psuedo streaming, but it works.     I have been looking at MogileFS, which would solve the storage part. With MogileFS I can make use of my current php solution as it supports lighttpd and apache (with mod_rewrite or similar). However I don't see how I can apply MogileFS to check for bandwidth % usage?     Any reccomendations for how I can solve this?</p><p>4 0.92393267 <a title="605-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-07-Using_ThreadLocal_to_pass_context_information_around_in_web_applications.html">115 high scalability-2007-10-07-Using ThreadLocal to pass context information around in web applications</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,     In java web servers, each http request is handled by a thread in thread pool. So for a Servlet handling the request, a thread is assigned. It is tempting (and very convinient) to keep context information in the threadlocal variable. I recently had a requirement where we need to assign logged in user id and timestamp to request sent to web services. Because we already had the code in place, it was extremely difficult to change the method signatures to pass user id everywhere. The solution I thought is   class ReferenceIdGenerator {   public static setReferenceId(String login) {      threadLocal.set(login + System.currentMillis());   }     public static String getReferenceId() {     return threadLocal.get();   }   private static ThreadLocal threadLocal =       new ThreadLocal();       }     class MySevlet {     void service(.....) {       HttpSession session = request.getSession(false);      String userId = session.get("userId");          ReferenceIdGenerator.setRefernceId(userId</p><p>5 0.90211183 <a title="605-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-13-Design_Preparations_for_Scaling.html">91 high scalability-2007-09-13-Design Preparations for Scaling</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Varnishis a state-of-the-art, high-performance HTTP accelerator. Varnish is
targeted primarily at the FreeBSD 6 and Linux 2.6 platforms, and will take
full advantage of the virtual memory system and advanced I/O features offered
by these operating systems.Varnish was written from the ground up to be a high
performance caching reverse proxy. Squid is a forward proxy that can be
configured as a reverse proxy. Besides - Squid is rather old and designed like
computer programs where supposed to be designed in 1980.Varnish is reported to
be 10x-20x faster than Squid on the same hardware.</p><p>3 0.17936906 <a title="662-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-22-Wikimedia_architecture.html">72 high scalability-2007-08-22-Wikimedia architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add
cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case.
Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we
don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL
hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to
deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is
Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on
Fotolog inSecrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success, which was one of my personal
favorites.Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site
nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog
has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G
available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding
performance and scaling requirements. To meet those requirements they've

<p>Introduction: In a paper delivered at HotCloud '12 by a group from CMU and Intel Labs,
Saving Cash by Using Less Cache (slides,  pdf), they show it may be possible
to use less DRAM under low load conditions to save on operational costs. There
are some issues with this idea, but in a give me more cache era, it could be
an interesting source of cost savings for your product. Caching is used
to:Reduce load on the database.Reduce latency.Problem:RAM in the cloud is
quite expensive. A third of costs can come from the caching tier.Solution:
Shrink your cache when the load is lower. Their work shows when the load drops
below a certain point you can throw away 50% of your cache while still
maintaining performance.A few popular items often account for most of your
hits, implying can remove the cache for the long tail. Use two tiers of
servers, the Retiring Group, which is the group of servers you want to get rid
of. The Primary Group is the group of servers you are keeping. A cache request
goes to both serve</p><p>3 0.77278954 <a title="662-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-30-Better_Browser_Caching_is_More_Important_than_No_Javascript_or_Fast_Networks_for_HTTP_Performance.html">1396 high scalability-2013-01-30-Better Browser Caching is More Important than No Javascript or Fast Networks for HTTP Performance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Performance guruSteve Souders gave his keynote presentation, Cache is King!
(slides), at the HTML5DevCon, besides being an extremely clear explanation of
how caching works on the Internet and how to optimize your use of HTTP to get
the best performance, Steve ran experiments that found some surprising results
on what gave the best web site performance improvements.In his base line test,
page loads took 7.65 seconds (median of three runs). What change--Fast
Network, No Javascript, or Primed Cache--would make the biggest performance
improvement? It was Primed Cache.Fast Network - Using a fast FIOS network the
load time was 4.13 seconds. Steve was surprised how big a difference this
made, given how much work must happen in the browser. No JavaScript - 4.74
seconds after disabling JavaScript. Both reduces transfers and skips parsing
by the browser. Steve thought the effect would have been larger.Primed Cache-

<p>Introduction: Dormandoshows an enlightened middle wayfor storing sessions in cache and the
database. Sessions are a perfect cache candidate because they are transient,
smallish, and since they are usually accessed on every page access removing
all that load from the database is a good thing. But as Dormando points out
session caches have problems. If you remove expiration times from the cache
and you run out of memory then no more logins. If a cache server fails or
needs to be upgrade then you just logged out a bunch of potentially angry
users.The middle ground Dormando proposes is using both the cache and the
database:Reads: read from the cache first, then the database. Typical cache
logic.Writes: write to memcached every time, write to the database every N
seconds (assuming the data has changed).There's a small chance of data loss,
but you've still greatly reduced the database load while providing
reliability. Nice solution.</p><p>6 0.74926025 <a title="662-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-29-Ehcache_-_A_Java_Distributed_Cache_.html">359 high scalability-2008-07-29-Ehcache - A Java Distributed Cache </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Deferred Deletesis a technique where deleted items are marked as deleted but
not garbage collected until some days or preferably weeks later. James
Hamilton talks describes this strategy in his classicOn Designing and
Deploying Internet-Scale Services:Never delete anything. Just mark it deleted.
When new data comes in, record the requests on the way. Keep a rolling two
week (or more) history of all changes to help recover from software or
administrative errors. If someone makes a mistake and forgets the where clause
on a delete statement (it has happened before and it will again), all logical
copies of the data are deleted. Neither RAID nor mirroring can protect against
this form of error. The ability to recover the data can make the difference
between a highly embarrassing issue or a minor, barely noticeable glitch. For
those systems already doing off-line backups, this additional record of data
coming into the service only needs to be since the last backup. But, being
cautious, we re</p><p>same-blog 2 0.9350577 <a title="662-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-27-Handle_700_Percent_More_Requests_Using_Squid_and_APC_Cache.html">662 high scalability-2009-07-27-Handle 700 Percent More Requests Using Squid and APC Cache</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thisposton www.ilovebonnie.net documents some impressive system performance
improvements by the addition ofSquid Cache(a caching proxy) andAPC
Cache(opcode cache for PHP).Apache is able to deliver roughly 700% more
requests per second with Squid when serving 1KB and 100KB images.Server load
is reduced using Squid because the server does not have to create a bunch of
Apache processes to handle the requests.APC Cache took a system that could
barely handle 10-20 requests per second to handling 50-60 requests per second.
A 400% increase.APC allowed the load times to remain under 5 seconds even with
200 concurrent threads slamming on the server.These two caches are easy to
setup and install and allow you to get a lot more performance out of them.The
post has an in-depth discussion and a number of supporting charts. The primary
point is how simple it can be to improve performance and scalability by adding
caching.</p><p>3 0.92396331 <a title="662-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-03-Product%3A_Collectl_-_Performance_Data_Collector.html">237 high scalability-2008-02-03-Product: Collectl - Performance Data Collector</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From theirwebsite:There are a number of times in which you find yourself
needing performance data. These can include benchmarking, monitoring a
system's general heath or trying to determine what your system was doing at
some time in the past. Sometimes you just want to know what the system is
doing right now. Depending on what you're doing, you often end up using
different tools, each designed to for that specific situation. Features
include:You are be able to run with non-integral sampling
intervals.Collectluses very little CPU. In fact it has been measured to use
<0.1% when run as a daemon using the default sampling interval of 60 seconds
for process and slab data and 10 seconds for everything else.Brief, verbose,
and plot formats are supported.You can report aggregated performance numbers
on many devices such as CPUs, Disks, interconnects such as Infiniband or
Quadrics, Networks or even Lustre file systems.Collectl will align its
sampling on integral second boundaries.Supports proce</p><p>4 0.92333174 <a title="662-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-28-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_28%2C_2013.html">1484 high scalability-2013-06-28-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 28, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I try to keep this blog targeted and on topic. So even though I may be
thankful for thesongof the tinniestsparrowatsunrise, I'll save you from all
that. It's hard to tie scalability and thegiving of thankstogether, especially
as it sometimes occurs to me that this blog may be a self-indulgent waste of
time. But I think I found a sentiment in A New THEORY of AWESOMENESS and
MIRACLES byJames Bridlethat manages to marry the topic of this blog and giving
thanks meaningfully together:I distrust commercial definitions of innovation,
and particularly of awesomeness. It's an overused term. When I think of
awesomeness, I want something awe-inspiring, vast and mind-expanding.So I
started thinking about things that I think are awesome, or miraculous, and for
me, it kept coming back to scale and complexity.We're not actually very good
about thinking about scale and complexity in real terms, so we have to use
metaphors and examples. Douglas Adams writes somewhere about how big the

<p>Introduction: We are at the beginning of the multicore era. Computers will have increasingly
many cores (processors), but there is still no good programming framework for
these architectures, and thus no simple and unified way for machine learning
to take advantage of the potential speed up.In this paper, we develop a
broadly applicable parallel programming method, one that is easily applied to
many different learning algorithms. Our work is in distinct contrast to the
tradition in machine learning of designing (often ingenious) ways to speed up
a single algorithm at a time.Specifically, we show that algorithms that fit
the Statistical Query model can be written in a certain “summation form,”
which allows them to be easily parallelized on multicore computers. We adapt
Google’s map-reduce paradigm to demonstrate this parallel speed up technique
on a variety of learning algorithms including locally weighted linear
regression (LWLR), k-means, logistic regression (LR), naive Bayes (NB), SVM,
ICA, PCA, g</p><p>4 0.72350985 <a title="608-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-12-Google_TechTalk%3A_Amdahl%27s_Law_in_the_Multicore_Era.html">534 high scalability-2009-03-12-Google TechTalk: Amdahl's Law in the Multicore Era</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Over the last several decades computer architects have been phenomenally
successful turning the transistor bounty provided by Moore's Law into chips
with ever increasing single-threaded performance. During many of these
successful years, however, many researchers paid scant attention to
multiprocessor work. Now as vendors turn to multicore chips, researchers are
reacting with more papers on multi-threaded systems. While this is good, we
are concerned that further work on single-thread performance will be
squashed.To help understand future high-level trade-offs, we develop a
corollary to Amdahl's Law for multicore chips [Hill & Marty, IEEE Computer
2008]. It models fixed chip resources for alternative designs that use
symmetric cores, asymmetric cores, or dynamic techniques that allow cores to
work together on sequential execution. Our results encourage multicore
designers to view performance of the entire chip rather than focus on core
efficiencies. Moreover, we observe that obtaining</p><p>5 0.70952713 <a title="608-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-08-Art_of_Parallelism_presentation.html">652 high scalability-2009-07-08-Art of Parallelism presentation</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Edward Capriolo has a really interesting article on his dramatic performance
expanding experience of turning on compression for Cassandra.The idea:Enabling
compression shrunk 71GB of data down to  31GB, which caused more data to fit
in RAM, which reduced disk IO to nearly nothing.Compression means more data
can be stored, which is like buying more machines without having to spend more
money.Compression means serving more data out of RAM, which means clients are
happier because of the performance improvements.The cost is higher CPU usage
to perform the encrypt/decrypt. But disk IO is orders of magnitude slower than
decompression and most servers have CPU to burn.Edward's article is well
written, has the specifics on how to turn on compression for Cassandra, pretty
graphs, and lots more details.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.75991488 <a title="608-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-27-The_Future_of_the_Parallelism_and_its_Challenges.html">608 high scalability-2009-05-27-The Future of the Parallelism and its Challenges</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Future of the Parallelism and its ChallengesResearch and education in
Parallel computing technologies is more important than ever. Here I present a
perspective on the past contributions, current status, and future direction of
the parallelism technologies.While machine power will grow impressively,
increased parallelism, rather than clock rate, will be driving force in
computing in the foreseeable future. This ongoing shift toward parallel
architectural paradigms is one of the greatest challenges for the
microprocessor and software industries. In 2005, Justin Ratter, chief
technology officer of Intel Corporation, said ‘We are at the cusp of a
transition to multicore, multithreaded architectures, and we still have not
demonstrated the ease of programming the move will require…’Key points:A

<p>Introduction: Urs Hoelzle, infrastructure guru and SVP at Google, made areally interesting
statementabout the economics of scale in the datacenter:We've shown that when
you run a large application in the datacenter, like Gmail, you can, compared
to a small organization running their own email server, you can save nearly a
factor of 100 in terms of compute and energy, when you run it at scale.My
first thought was shock at the magnitude of the difference. 100x is a chasm
crosser. Then I thought about Gmail, it's horizontally scalable using
technologies that are following Moore's Law (storage and compute), latency
requirements are lax, a commodity network is sufficient, and it can be highly
automated so management costs scale slower than users. After that it's a
simple matter of software :-) Oh, and developing a market where it's "cheaper
to run a large thing than a small thing."</p><p>6 0.73503208 <a title="608-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-30-Strategy%3A_Use_Your_Quantum_Computer_Lab_to_Tell_Intentional_Blinks_from_Involuntary_Blinks.html">1540 high scalability-2013-10-30-Strategy: Use Your Quantum Computer Lab to Tell Intentional Blinks from Involuntary Blinks</a></p>

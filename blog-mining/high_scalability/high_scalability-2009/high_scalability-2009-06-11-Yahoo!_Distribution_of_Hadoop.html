<p>Introduction: Has a Java only Hadoop been getting you down? Now you can be  Happy . Happy is a  framework for writing map-reduce programs for Hadoop using Jython. It files off the sharp edges on Hadoop and makes writing map-reduce programs a breeze . There's really no history yet on Happy, but I'm delighted at the idea of being able to map-reduce in  other languages . The more ways the better.  From the website:
   Happy is a framework that allows Hadoop jobs to be written and run in Python 2.2 using Jython. It is an  easy way to write map-reduce programs for Hadoop, and includes some new useful features as well.  The current release supports Hadoop 0.17.2.  Map-reduce jobs in Happy are defined by sub-classing happy.HappyJob and implementing a  map(records, task) and reduce(key, values, task) function. Then you create an instance of the  class, set the job parameters (such as inputs and outputs) and call run().

<p>Introduction: A demonstration, with repeatable steps, of how to quickly fire-up a Hadoop cluster on Amazon EC2, load data onto the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File-System), write map-reduce scripts in Ruby and use them to run a map-reduce job on your Hadoop cluster. You will  not  need to ssh into the cluster, as all tasks are run from your local machine.

 Fire-Up Your Hadoop Cluster 

I choose the  Cloudera distribution of Hadoop  which is still 100% Apache licensed, but has some additional benefits. One of these benefits is that it is released by  Doug Cutting , who started Hadoop and drove itâ€™s development at Yahoo! He also started  Lucene , which is another of my favourite Apache Projects, so I have good faith that he knows what he is doing. Another benefit, as you will see, is that it is simple to fire-up a Hadoop cluster.

<p>Introduction: Yahoo has developed a new language called Pig Latin that fit in a sweet spot between high-level declarative querying in the spirit of SQL, and low-level, procedural programming `a la map-reduce and combines best of both worlds.  The accompanying system, Pig, is fully implemented, and compiles Pig Latin into physical plans that are executed over Hadoop, an open-source, map-reduce implementation. Pig has just graduated from the Apache Incubator and joined Hadoop as a subproject.  The paper has a few examples of how engineers at Yahoo! are using Pig to dramatically reduce the time required for the development and execution of their data analysis tasks, compared to using Hadoop directly.

Distribution of Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many people in the Apache Hadoop community have asked Yahoo! to publish the version of Apache Hadoop they test and deploy across their large Hadoop clusters. As a service to the Hadoop community, Yahoo is releasing the Yahoo! Distribution of Hadoop -- a source code distribution that is based entirely on code found in the Apache Hadoop project.   This source distribution includes code patches that they have added to improve the stability and performance of their clusters. In all cases, these patches have already been contributed back to Apache, but they may not yet be available in an Apache release of Hadoop.

 Good idea:  Open The Index And Speed Up The Internet .  SmugMug estimates 50%  of their CPU is spent serving crawler robots. Having a common meta-data repository wouldn't prevent search engines from having their own special sauce. Then the problem becomes one of syncing data between repositories and processing change events. A generous soul could even offer a shared MapReduce service over the data. Now that would  speed up the internet . 
 Scaling Achievements:  YouTube Sees 3 Billion Views per Day ;  Twitter produces a sustained feed of 35 Mb per second ;Â  companies processing billions of APIs calls Â (Twitter, Netflix, Amazon, NPR, Google, Facebook, eBay, Bing);Â  Astronomers Identify the Farthest Object Ever Observed, 13.14 Billion Light Years Away

<p>Introduction: The NoSQL movement faults the SQL query language as the source of  many of the scalability issues that we face today with traditional  database approach.
 
I think that the main reason so many people  have come to see SQL as the source of all evil is the fact that,  traditionally, the query language was burned into the database  implementation. So by saying NoSQL you basically say "No" to the  traditional non-scalable RDBMS implementations.
 
This view has  brought on a flood of alternative query languages, each aiming to solve a  different aspect that is missing in the traditional SQL query approach,  such as a document model, or that provides a simpler approach, such as  Key/Value query.
 
Most of the people I speak with seem fairly confused on this subject,  and tend to use query semantics and architecture interchangeably. In  Part I  of this post i tried to provide quick overview of what  each query term stands for in the context of the NoSQL world .  Part II Â illustrates those ide</p><p>5 0.95157516 <a title="627-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-17-Product%3A_Hadoop.html">601 high scalability-2009-05-17-Product: Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 5:   Hadoop Sorts a Petabyte in 16.25 Hours and a Terabyte in 62 Seconds  and has its  green cred questioned  because it took 40 times the number of machines Greenplum used to do the same work.   Update 4:   Introduction to Pig . Pig allows you to skip programming Hadoop at the low map-reduce level. You don't have to know Java. Using the Pig Latin language, which is a scripting data flow language, you can think about your problem as a data flow program. 10 lines of Pig Latin = 200 lines of Java.   Update 3 : Scaling Hadoop to  4000 nodes at Yahoo! .  30,000 cores with nearly 16PB of raw disk; sorted 6TB of data completed in 37 minutes; 14,000 map tasks writes (reads) 360 MB (about 3 blocks) of data into a single file with a total of 5.04 TB for the whole job.  Update 2 : Hadoop  Summit and Data-Intensive Computing Symposium Videos and Slides .

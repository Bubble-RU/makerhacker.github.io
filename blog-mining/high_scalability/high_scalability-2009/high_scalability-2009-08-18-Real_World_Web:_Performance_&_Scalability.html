<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-
grid.It's 2003: Add a caching layer.It's 2004: Add scale-out and
partitioning.It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a

<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add
cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case.
Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we
don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL
hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to
deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is
Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on
Fotolog inSecrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success, which was one of my personal
favorites.Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site
nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog
has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G
available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding
performance and scaling requirements. To meet those requirements they've
developed a soph</p><p>4 0.11990006 <a title="684-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-12-4_Architecture_Issues_When_Scaling_Web_Applications%3A_Bottlenecks%2C_Database%2C_CPU%2C_IO.html">1646 high scalability-2014-05-12-4 Architecture Issues When Scaling Web Applications: Bottlenecks, Database, CPU, IO</a></p>

Applications.I will cover architecture issues that show up while scaling and
performance tuning large scale web application in this blog.Lets start by
defining few terms to create common understanding and vocabulary. Later on I
will go through different issues that pop-up while scaling web application

ApplicationDetermining optimal thread pool size of an web application will be
covered in next blog.PerformanceTerm performance of web application is used to
mean several things. Most developers are primarily concerned with are response
time and scalability. Response TimeIs the time taken by web application to
process request and return response. Applications should respond to requests
(response time) within acceptable duration. If application is taking beyond
the acceptable time, it is said to be non-performing or degraded.

<p>Introduction: ProfessorDavid Malangives a very good lecture on scalability for dynamic
websites. It's not highly technical, it's an extension course, but it's a
great introduction to a wide variety of topics. I really like his teaching
style. He continually asks questions, prompts for input, and gives accessible
explanations. Some of the topics covered: vertical scaling; horizontal
scaling; PHP acceleration; load balancing: DNS, L7, sticky sessions, load
balancers; caching; MySQL: replication, load balancing, partitioning, high
availability.Watch it onAcademic EarthThis is one lecture in a series of 13
lectures on building dynamic websites. Students learn how to: build dynamic
websites with Ajax and with Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP); set up
domain names with DNS; structure pages with XHTML and CSS how to program in
JavaScript and PHP; configure Apacheand MySQL; design and query databases with
SQL; use Ajax with both XML andJSON;  build mashups.For thelecture notesgo to

<p>Introduction: Film buffs will recognize Django as a classic 1966 spaghetti western that
spawned hundreds of imitators. Web heads will certainly first think of Django
as the classic Python based Web framework that has also spawned hundreds of
imitators and has become the gold standard framework for the web.Mike Malone,
who worked on Pownce, a blogging tool now owned by Six Apart, tells in this
very informative EuroDjangoCon presentation how Pownce scaled using Django in
the real world.I was surprised to learn how large Pounce was: hundreds of
requests/sec, thousands of DB operations/sec, millions of user relationships,
millions of notes, and terabytes of static data. Django has a lot of
functionality in the box to help you scale, but if you want to scale large it
turns out Django has some limitations and Mike tells you what these are and
also provides some code to get around them.Mike's talk-although Django
specific--will really help anyone creating applications on the web. There's a

<p>Introduction: Hi everyone, I'm researching on Scalability for a college paper, and found
this site great, but it has too many tips, articles and the like, but I can't
see a hierarchical organization of subjects, I would need something like a
checklist of things or fields, or technologies to take into account when
assesing scalability.So far I've identified these:- Hardware scalability:-
scale out- scale up- CacheWhat types of cache are there? app-level, os-level,
network-level, I/O-level?- Load Balancing- DB ClusteringAm I missing something
important? (I'm sure I am)I don't expect you to give a lecture here, but maybe
point some things out, give me some useful links...Thanks!</p><p>same-blog 2 0.9697305 <a title="684-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-18-Real_World_Web%3A_Performance_%26_Scalability.html">684 high scalability-2009-08-18-Real World Web: Performance & Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We've referenced this189 slide masterpieceby Ask Bjorn Hansen before, but it
was hidden without its own first class link. He describes his presentation as
3 hours of 5 minute lightening talks and that sounds about right.The
presentation covers:overall platform and architecture considerations involved
in tuning applications from a holistic perspective. You'll be shown design
scalable architectures for dynamic, high-volume web sites. Topics covered
include caching, scalable database design, replication architecture, load-
balancing, and architectural decisions derived from many years of
experience.His prime directive of scaling:Think Horizontallyat every point in
your architecture, not just at the web tier.You may not agree with everything,
but there's a lot of useful advice. Here's a summary of some of what is
covered:BenchmarkingVertical scaling sucks.Horizontal scaling rocks.Run many

<p>Introduction: Update 3: InfoQ'sBig Architecture Up Front - A Case of Premature
Scalaculation?twines several different threads on the topic together into a
fine noose.Update 2: Kevin says thebiggest problems he sees with startups is
they need to scaletheir backend (no, the other one).Update: My bad.It's hard
to sell scalabilityso just forget it.The premise ofStartups and The Problem Of
Premature ScalaculationandDonâ&euro;&trade;t scale: 99.999% uptime is for Wal-Martis that
you shouldn't spend precious limited resources worrying about scaling before
you've first implemented the functionality that will make you successful
enough to have scaling problems in the first place. It's kind of an embodied
life force model of system creation. Energy is scarce so any parasites
siphoning off energy must be hunted down and destroyed so the body has its
best chance of survival. Is this really how it works?If I ever believed this I
certainly don't believe it anymore. The world has changed, even since
2005.Thanks to many books a</p><p>4 0.94554287 <a title="684-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-08-Distribution_of_queries_per_second.html">622 high scalability-2009-06-08-Distribution of queries per second</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We need to measure the number of queries-per-second our site gets for capacity
planning purposes.Obviously, we need to provision the site based on the peak
QPS, not average QPS. There will always be some spikes in traffic, though,
where for one particular second we get a really huge number of queries. It's
ok if site performance slightly degrades during that time. So what I'd really
like to do is estimate the *near* peak QPS based on average or median QPS.
Near peak might be defined as the QPS that I get at the 95th percentile of the
busiest seconds during the day.My guess is that this is similar to what ISPs
do when they measure your bandwidth usage and then charge for usage over the
95th percentile.What we've done is analyzed our logs, counted the queries
executed during each second during the day, sorted from the busiest seconds to
the least busy ones, and graphed it. What you get is a histogram that steeply
declines and flattens out near zero.Does anyone know if there is a

<p>Introduction: Skype's 220 millions users lost service for a stunning two days. The primary
cause for Skype's nightmare (can you imagine the beeper storm that went off?)
was a massive global roll-out of aWindow's patchtriggering the simultaneous
reboot of millions of machines across the globe. The secondary cause was a bug
in Skype's software that prevented "self-healing" in the face of such attacks.
The flood of log-in requests and a lack of "peer-to-peer resources" melted
their system.breakWho's fault is it? Is Skype to blame? Is Microsoft to blame?
Or is the peer-to-peer model itself fundamentally flawed in some way?Let's be
real, how could Skype possibly test booting 220 million servers over a random
configuration of resources? Answer: they can't. Yes, it's Skype's
responsibility, but they are in a bit of a pickle on this one.The boot
scenario is one of the most basic and one of the most difficult scalability
scenarios to plan for and test. You can't simulate the viciousness of real-
life conditi</p><p>6 0.94344914 <a title="684-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-11-The_Implications_of_Punctuated_Scalabilium_for_Website_Architecture.html">533 high scalability-2009-03-11-The Implications of Punctuated Scalabilium for Website Architecture</a></p>

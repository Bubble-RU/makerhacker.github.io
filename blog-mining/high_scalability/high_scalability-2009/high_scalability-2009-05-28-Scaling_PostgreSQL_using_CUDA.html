<p>Introduction: In some ways the original Amazon cloud, the one most of us still live in, was like that really cool house that when you stepped inside and saw the old  green shag carpet  in the living room, you knew the house hadn't been updated in a while. The network is a little slow, the processors are a bit dated, and virtualization made the house just feel smaller. It has been difficult to run high bandwidth or low latency workloads in the cloud. Bottlenecks everywhere. Not a big deal for most applications, but for many high performance applications (HPC) it was a killer.
 
In a typical house you might just do a remodel. Upgrade a few rooms. Swap out builder quality appliances with gleaming stainless steel monsters. But Amazon has a big lot, instead of remodeling they simply keep adding on entire new wings, kind of like the  Winchester Mystery House  of computing.

<p>Introduction: Combining GPU power with PostgreSQL      PostgreSQL is one of the world's leading Open Source databases and it provides enormous flexibility as well as extensibility. One of the key features of PostgreSQL is that users can define their own procedures and functions in basically any known programming language. With the means of functions it is possible to write basically any server side codes easily.     Now, all this extensibility is basically not new. What does it all have to do with scaling and then? Well, imagine a world where the data in your database and enormous computing power are tightly integrated. Imagine a world where data inside your database has direct access to hundreds of FPUs. Welcome to the world of CUDA, NVIDIA's way of making the power of graphics cards available to normal, high-performance applications.

<p>Introduction: This is an interview with   MemSQL    cofounder’s    Eric Frenkiel    and    Nikita Shamgunov   , in which they try to answer critics by going into more depth about their technology.     MemSQL ruffled a few feathers with their claim of being the fastest database in the world. According to their benchmarks MemSQL can execute 200K TPS on an EC2   Quadruple   Extra Large   and on a 64 core machine they can push 1.2 million transactions a second.     Benchmarks are always a dark mirror, so make of them what you will, but the target market for MemSQL is clear: projects looking for something both fast and familiar. Fast as in a novel design using a combination of technologies like    MVCC   , code generation,    lock-free data structures   ,    skip lists   , and    in-memory execution   . Familiar as in SQL and nothing but SQL. The only interface to MemSQL is SQL.    It’s right to point out MemSQL gets a boost by being a first release. Only a limited subset of SQL is supported, neither rep</p><p>3 0.72118127 <a title="609-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-05-How_will_memristors_change_everything%3F_.html">823 high scalability-2010-05-05-How will memristors change everything? </a></p>
<p>Introduction: A non-random sample of my tech friends shows that not many have heard of  memristors  (though I do suspect vote tampering). I'd read a little about memristors in  2008  when the initial hubbub about the existence of memristors was raised. I, however,  immediately filed them into that comforting conceptual bucket of potentially revolutionary technologies I didn't have to worry about because like most wondertech, nothing would ever come of it. Wrong. After watching  Finding the   Missing  Memristor  by R. Stanley Williams I've had to change my mind. Memristors have gone from "maybe never" to holy cow this could happen soon and it could change everything.
 
Let's assume for the sake of dreaming memristors do prove out. How will we design systems when we have access to a new material that is two orders of magnitude more efficient from a power perspective than traditional transistor technologies, contains multiple petabits (1 petabit = 128TB) of persistent storage, and can be reconfigured t</p><p>4 0.71955395 <a title="609-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-05-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_5%2C_2013.html">1436 high scalability-2013-04-05-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 5, 2013</a></p>

 Quotable Quotes:                                            
 
  Seymour Cray : A supercomputer is a device for turning compute-bound problems into IO-bound problems. 
  Robert Sapolsky : And why is self-organization so beautiful to my atheistic self? Because if complex, adaptive systems don’t require a blue print, they don’t require a blue print maker. If they don’t require lightning bolts, they don’t require Someone hurtling lightning bolts. 
  @swardley : Asked for a history of PaaS? From memory, public launch - Zimki ('06), BungeeLabs ('06), Heroku ('07), GAE ('08), CloudFoundry ('11) ... 
  @neil_conway : If you're designing scalable systems, you should understand backpressure and build mechanisms to support it.

<p>Introduction: Combining GPU power with PostgreSQL      PostgreSQL is one of the world's leading Open Source databases and it provides enormous flexibility as well as extensibility. One of the key features of PostgreSQL is that users can define their own procedures and functions in basically any known programming language. With the means of functions it is possible to write basically any server side codes easily.     Now, all this extensibility is basically not new. What does it all have to do with scaling and then? Well, imagine a world where the data in your database and enormous computing power are tightly integrated. Imagine a world where data inside your database has direct access to hundreds of FPUs. Welcome to the world of CUDA, NVIDIA's way of making the power of graphics cards available to normal, high-performance applications.     When it comes to complex computations databases might very well turn out to be a bottleneck. Depending on your application it might easily happen that adding more</p><p>2 0.88925833 <a title="609-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-30-Dramatically_Improving_Performance_by_Debugging_Brutally_Complex_Prolems.html">1314 high scalability-2012-08-30-Dramatically Improving Performance by Debugging Brutally Complex Prolems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Debugging complex problems is 90% persistence and 50% cool tools. Brendan Gregg in  10 Performance Wins  tells a fascinating story of how a team at Joyent solved some weird and challenging performance issues deep in the OS. It took lots of effort,  DTrace ,  Flame Graphs ,  USE Method , and writing custom tools when necessary. Here's a quick summary of the solved cases:
  
  Monitoring. 1000x improvement . An application blocked while paging anonymous memory back in. It was also blocked during file system fsync() calls. The application was misconfigured and sometimes briefly exceeded available memory, getting page out. 
  Riak. 2x improvement . The Erlang VM used half the CPU count it was supposed to, so CPUs remained unused.  Fix was a configuration change. 
  MySQL. 380x improvement . Reads were slow. Cause was correlated writes. Fix was to tune the cache flush interval on the storage controller. 
  Various. 2800x improvement .

<p>Introduction: This question comes from Ulysses on an  interesting thread  from the Mechanical Sympathy news group, especially given how multiple processors are now the norm:
 
Ulysses:
   
 On an 8xCPU Linux instance,  is it at all advantageous to use the Linux taskset command to pin an 8xJVM process set (co-ordinated as a www.infinispan.org distributed cache/data grid) to a specific CPU affinity set  (i.e. pin JVM0 process to CPU 0, JVM1 process to CPU1, ...., JVM7process to CPU 7) vs. just letting the Linux OS use its default mechanism for provisioning the 8xJVM process set to the available CPUs? 
 In effrort to seek an optimal point (in the full event space), what are the conceptual trade-offs in considering "searching" each permutation of provisioning an 8xJVM process set to an 8xCPU set via taskset? 
   
Given  taskset  is they key to the question, it would help to have a definition:
  

Used to set or retrieve the CPU affinity of a running process given its PID or to launch a new COMMAND with</p><p>5 0.87969166 <a title="609-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-09-15-4_Reasons_Facebook_Dumped_HTML5_and_Went_Native.html">1323 high scalability-2012-09-15-4 Reasons Facebook Dumped HTML5 and Went Native</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Facebook made quite a splash when they released their  native iOS app , not because of their app per se, but because of their conclusion that their  biggest mistake was betting on HTML5 , so they had to go native.
 
As you might imagine this was a bit like telling a Great White Shark that its bark is worse than its bite.  A  common refrain  was Facebook simply had made a bad HTML5 site, not that HTML5 itself is bad, as plenty of other vendors have made slick well performing mobile sites.
 
An interesting and relevant conversation given the rising butt kickery of mobile. But we were lacking details. Now we aren't. If you were wondering just why Facebook ditched HTML5, Tobie Langel in  Perf Feedback - What's slowing down Mobile Facebook , lists out the reasons:
  
  Tooling / Developer APIs . Most importantly, the lack of tooling to track down memory problems.  
  Scrolling performance.  Scrolling must be fast and smooth and full featured. It's not.

<p>Introduction: AWStats  is a free powerful and featureful tool that generates advanced web, streaming, ftp or mail server statistics, graphically. This log analyzer works as a CGI or from command line and shows you all possible information your log contains, in few graphical web pages. It uses a partial information file to be able to process large log files, often and quickly. It can analyze log files from all major server tools like Apache log files (NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log format or common/CLF log format), WebStar, IIS (W3C log format) and a lot of other web, proxy, wap, streaming servers, mail servers and some ftp servers.</p><p>3 0.14098118 <a title="570-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-28-Product%3A_Web_Log_Storming.html">37 high scalability-2007-07-28-Product: Web Log Storming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Web Log Storming  is an interactive, desktop-based Web Log Analyzer for Windows. The whole new concept of log analysis makes it clearly different from any other web log analyzer. Browse through statistics to get into details - down to individual visitor's session. Check individual visitor behavior pattern and how it fits into your desired scenario.  Web Log Storming does far more than just generate common reports - it displays detailed web site statistics with interactive graphs and reports. Very complete detailed log analysis of activity from every visitor to your web site is only a mouse-click away.  In other words, analyze your web logs like never before!   It's easy to track sessions, hits, page views, downloads, or whatever metric is most important to each user. You can look at referring pages and see which search engines and keywords were used to bring visitors to the site. Web site behavior, from the top entry and exit pages, to the paths that users follow, can be analyzed.

Yes, it Delivers More Consistent and Higher Performance IO</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Amazon created a whole new class of service with their  Provisioned IOPS  for RDS, EBS, and DynamoDB. The idea is simple. If you want more performance, you turn a dial up. If you want less, you turn a dial down. A beautifully simple model. You pay for the performance you want, which is different than their previous cloud model, where performance varied, but you paid only for what you used. 
 
The question: Do these higher priced services really work better?
 
 Rodrigo Campos  put this question to the test (only for EBS) by running a benchmark he describes in  IOMelt Provisioned IOPS EBS Benchmark Results - December 2012 .
 
The result?  Yes,   AWS Provisioned IOPS Volumes Really Deliver More Consistent and Higher Performance IO :
  

It is clear that the provisioned IOPS EBS volumes offer a huge performance upgrade when compared to the non-optimized EBS volumes, but as data has to be spread among more underlying disks or systems, it seems that the volume is increasingly more susceptibl</p><p>6 0.12763548 <a title="570-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-21-Processing_100_Million_Pixels_a_Day_-_Small_Amounts_of_Contention_Cause_Big_Problems_at_Scale.html">1390 high scalability-2013-01-21-Processing 100 Million Pixels a Day - Small Amounts of Contention Cause Big Problems at Scale</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Gordon Worley , a Software Engineer at  Korrelate , where they correlate (see what they did there) online purchases to offline purchases. 
 
Several weeks ago, we came into the office one morning to find every server alarm going off. Pixel log processing was behind by 8 hours and not making headway. Checking the logs, we discovered that a big client had come online during the night and was giving us 10 times more traffic than we were originally told to expect. I wouldn’t say we panicked, but the office was certainly more jittery than usual. Over the next several hours, though, thanks both to foresight and quick thinking, we were able to scale up to handle the added load and clear the backlog to return log processing to a steady state.
 
At Korrelate, we deploy  tracking pixels , also known beacons or web bugs, that our partners use to send us information about their users. These tiny web objects contain no visible content, but may include transparent 1 by 1 gif</p><p>6 0.72371203 <a title="570-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-01-Statistics_Logging_Scalability.html">105 high scalability-2007-10-01-Statistics Logging Scalability</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the world's leading technical institutes, the Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) created the fastest supercomputer in Asia, and one of the largest outside of the United States. Using Sun x64 servers and data servers deployed in a grid architecture, Tokyo Tech built a cost-effective, flexible supercomputer that meets the demands of compute- and data-intensive applications. Built in just 35 days, the TSUBAME grid includes hundreds of systems incorporating thousands of processor cores and terabytes of memory, and delivers 47.38 trillion1 floating-point operations per second (TeraFLOPS) of sustained LINPACK benchmark performance and 1.1 petabyte of storage to users running common off-the-shelf applications. Based on the deployment architecture, the grid is expected to reach 100 TeraFLOPS in the future. This Sun BluePrints article provides an overview of the Tokyo Tech grid, named TSUBAME.

<p>Introduction: Does anyone know of any articles or papers that discuss the nuts and bolts of how web analytics is implemented at organizations with large volumes of web traffic and a critcal business need to analyze that data - e.g. places like Amazon.com, eBay, and Google?     Just as a fun project I'm planning to build my own web log analysis app that can effectively index and query large volumes of web log data (i.e. TB range). But first I'd like to learn more about how it's done in the organizations whose lifeblood depends on this stuff. Even just a high level architectural overview of their approaches would be nice to have.</p><p>5 0.82231355 <a title="570-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-20-Alternate_strategy_for_database_sharding.html">546 high scalability-2009-03-20-Alternate strategy for database sharding</a></p>

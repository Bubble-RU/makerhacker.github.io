<p>Introduction: I have 3 exp in building website using java.I work on only single server.Website is not very scalable.I always wonder how ebay,youtube,monster handle traffic, giving responses within seconds.From the google i find this site and i hope i can also able to build very scalable website .I need guidelines from where to start ,what are the things we needed.I know that scalability comes through the use of distributed applications but don't how to implement it.   I see many website build in languages other than java so java is good choice for building high scalable website.

<p>Introduction: Update 3:   The book was released! Find it on Amazon at   The Art of Capacity Planning  .    Update 2:   Maybe the iPhone can use a little capacity planning?   What's Behind the iPhone 3G Glitches  :   One source says Apple programmed the Infineon chip to demand a more powerful 3G signal than the iPhone really requires. So if too many people try to make a call or go on the Internet in a given area, some of the devices will decide there's insufficient power and switch to the slower networkâ&euro;&rdquo;even if there is enough 3G bandwidth available.      Update:   To get a taste of what will be served,   mySQL DBA    has a nice post titled   Capacity Planning, Architecture, Scaling, Response time, Throughput  . You learn how to figure out when your application will break by building a 3rd order polynomial.  Cool stuff!     John Allspaw who is the Operations Engineering Manager at Flickr is about to publish a book with O'Reilly.     There are not much details so far but it seems interesting and relev</p><p>5 0.12791306 <a title="552-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-10-Blog%3A_Scalable_Web_Architectures_by_Royans_Tharakan.html">88 high scalability-2007-09-10-Blog: Scalable Web Architectures by Royans Tharakan</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I have introduced pattern languages in my earlier post on  The Pattern Bible for Distributed Computing .  Achieving highest possible scalability is a complex combination of many factors. This PLoP 2007  paper  presents a pattern language that can be used to make a system highly scalable.  The Scalability Pattern Language introduced by Kanwardeep Singh Ahluwalia includes patterns to:
  
 Introduce Scalability 
 
 Optimize Algorithm 
 
 Add Hardware 
 
 Add Parallelism 
 
 Add Intra-Process Parallelism 
 Add Inter-Porcess Parallelism 
 Add Hybrid Parallelism 
 
 
 
 Optimize Decentralization 
 
 Control Shared Resources 
 
 Automate Scalability</p><p>3 0.72382385 <a title="552-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-22-The_high_scalability_community.html">220 high scalability-2008-01-22-The high scalability community</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,     First of all; thanks for a creating a GREAT resource on high scalability architecture. For us building high scalability solutions from the west coast of (tiny) Norway good input on the subject isn't always abundant.     Which leads me to my next question; Are there any events or conferences on high scalability / SaaS in the US or internationally that any of you would recommend architects or data center managers to attend?</p><p>4 0.70478362 <a title="552-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-27-Scalability_vs_Performance_vs_Availability_vs_Reliability.._Also_scale_up_vs_scale_out_%3F%3F%3F.html">224 high scalability-2008-01-27-Scalability vs Performance vs Availability vs Reliability..

<p>Introduction: Where do you draw the line between scalability vs Performance vs High Availability vs Reliability?     I guess at the end of the day, we all want to be highly available, great performance and always reliable. So is it safe to say that scalability is the answer ?      Also when do you start to think scale out vs scale up ?</p><p>5 0.68028075 <a title="552-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-10-Blog%3A_Scalable_Web_Architectures_by_Royans_Tharakan.html">88 high scalability-2007-09-10-Blog: Scalable Web Architectures by Royans Tharakan</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Pinterest co-founder Paul Sciarra  shared a bit about their stack  on Quora:
  
 Python + heavily-modified Django at the application layer 
 Tornado and (very selectively) node.js as web-servers.   
 Memcached and membase / redis for object- and logical-caching, respectively.   
 RabbitMQ as a message queue.   
 Nginx, HAproxy and Varnish for static-delivery and load-balancing. 
 Persistent data storage using MySQL.   
 MrJob on EMR for map-reduce. 
 Git.

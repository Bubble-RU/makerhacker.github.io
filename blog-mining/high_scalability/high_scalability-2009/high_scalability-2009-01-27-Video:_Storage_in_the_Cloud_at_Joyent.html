<p>Introduction: A recent   InfoWorld article   claims that "With Cisco expected to enter the blade market and Sun expected to offer networking equipment, things could get interesting awfully fast." How does this effect your infrastructure strategy and decisions?     Would you consider to build scalable web applications on the Cisco Unified Computing System? Or would you consider to build a router out of a server with the use of OpenSolaris and Project Crossbow as the article suggests? Will any of these initiatives change the way we build scalable web infrastructure or are these just attempts to sale these systems?     What do you think?</p><p>3 0.19651458 <a title="503-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-01-Joyent_-_Cloud_Computing_Built_on_Accelerators.html">399 high scalability-2008-10-01-Joyent - Cloud Computing Built on Accelerators</a></p>

Joyent is an infrastructure and development company that has put together a multi-site, multi-million dollar hosting setup for their own applications and for the use of others  . Joyent competes with the likes of Amazon and GoGrid in the multi-player cloud computing game and hosts   Bumper Sticker: A 1 Billion Page Per Month Facebook RoR App  .

<p>Introduction: Several months ago I attended a Joyent presentation where the spokesman hinted that Joyent had the chops to support a one billion page per month Facebook Ruby on Rails application. Even under a few seconds of merciless grilling he would not give up the name of the application. Now we have the big reveal: it was LinkedIn's  Bumper Sticker  app. For those not currently sticking things on bumps, Bumper Sticker is quite surprisingly a  viral media sharing application that allows users to express their individuality by sticking small virtual stickers on Facebook profiles . At the time I was quite curious how Joyent's cloud approach could be leveraged for this kind of app. Now that they've released a few details, we get to find out.

<p>Introduction: The Clustered Storage Revolution 
 
If the clustered file system, clustered storage system, storage virtualization movement is new to you then this is a good intro paper. It's a both vendor puff piece and informative, so it might be worth your time.
  A Quick Hit of What's Inside  
Clustered storage architectures have the ability to pull together two or more storage devices to behave as a single entity. Clustered storage can be broken down into three types:
  
 2-way simple failover clustering 
 Namespace aggregation 
 Clustered storage with a distributed file systems (DFS)</p><p>5 0.54213351 <a title="503-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-05-Product%3A_Amazon_Simple_Storage_Service.html">525 high scalability-2009-03-05-Product: Amazon Simple Storage Service</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:   HostedFTP.com - Amazon S3 Performance Report . How fast is S3? Based on their own study HostedFTP.com has found: 10 to 12 MB/second when storing and receiving files and 140 ms per file stored as a fixed overhead cost.
   
  Update:   A Quantitative Comparison of Rackspace and Amazon Cloud Storage Solutions . S3 isn't the only cloud storage service out there. Mosso is saying they can save you so money while offering support. There are number of scenarios in their paper, but For 5TB of cloud storage Mosso will save you 17% over S3 without support and 42% with support. For their CDN on a Global test Mosso says the average response time is 333ms for CloudFront vs. 107ms for Cloud Files which means globally, Cloud Files is 3.1 times or 211% faster than CloudFront.   Amazon S3  is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.  This service allows you to link directly to files at a cost of 15 cents per GB of storage, and 20 cents per GB</p><p>6 0.53998548 <a title="503-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome_List_of_Advanced_Distributed_Systems_Papers.html">1049 high scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome List of Advanced Distributed Systems Papers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: What's the cost of downtime to your business?  $100,000 per hour, $1,000,000 or more? The recent Volcanic ash that has grounded European flights is estimated to be costing the airlines $200M a day. In the IT world, High Availability (HA) architectures allow for disaster recovery as well as uninterrupted business continuity during system failure.
 
This post focuses on a customer’s backend, comprised of a business application stack supported by a dozen Oracle databases. They wish to equip this infrastructure with HA features and ensure that outages do not cost business. How do we address the challenge of pricing the complete solution, with hardware, software, services and annual support?

<p>Introduction: Hi,     First of all; thanks for a creating a GREAT resource on high scalability architecture. For us building high scalability solutions from the west coast of (tiny) Norway good input on the subject isn't always abundant.     Which leads me to my next question; Are there any events or conferences on high scalability / SaaS in the US or internationally that any of you would recommend architects or data center managers to attend?</p><p>4 0.64049441 <a title="503-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-01-An_Open_Source_Web_Solution_-_Lighttpd_Web_Server_and_Chip_Multithreading_Technology__.html">452 high scalability-2008-12-01-An Open Source Web Solution - Lighttpd Web Server and Chip Multithreading Technology  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: With more users interacting, working, purchasing, and communicating over the network than ever before, Web 2.0 infrastructure is taking center stage in many organizations. Demand is rising, and companies are looking for ways to tackle the performance and scalability needs placed on Web infrastructure without raising IT operational expenses. Today companies are turning to efďŹ cient, high-performance, open source solutions as a way to decrease acquisition, licensing, and other ongoing costs and stay within budget constraints.</p><p>5 0.59290665 <a title="503-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-02-nginx%3A_high_performance_smpt-pop-imap_proxy.html">172 high scalability-2007-12-02-nginx: high performance smpt-pop-imap proxy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: nginx is a high performance smtp/pop/imap proxy that lets you do custom authorization and lookups and is very scalable. (just add nodes)     Nginx by default is a reverse proxy and this is what it is doing here for pop/imap connections. It is also an excellelent reverse proxy for web servers.     Advantage: You dont have to have a speacial database or ldap schema. Just an url to  do auth and lookup with.   A url that may be accessed by a unix or a tcp socket. Write your own auth handler - according to your own policy.     For example:    A user called atif tries to login with the pass testxyz.   You pass this infomation to a URL such as   socket:/var/tmp/xyz.sock   or   http://auth.corp.mailserver.net:someport/someurl     The auth server replies with either a FAILURE such as      Auth-Status: Invalid Login or password     or with a success such as   Auth-Status: OK   Auth-Server: OneOfThe100Servers   Auth-Port: optionalyAPort     We have implemented it at our ISP and it has saves us a</p><p>6 0.54917675 <a title="503-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-31-Facebook_in_20_Minutes%3A_2.7M_Photos%2C_10.2M_Comments%2C_4.6M_Messages.html">966 high scalability-2010-12-31-Facebook in 20 Minutes: 2.7M Photos, 10.2M Comments, 4.6M Messages</a></p>

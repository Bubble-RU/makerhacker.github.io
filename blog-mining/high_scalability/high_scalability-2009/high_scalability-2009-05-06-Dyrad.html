<p>Introduction: Dryad is Microsoft's answer to Google'smap-reduce. What's the question: How do
you process really large amounts of data? My initial impression of Dryad is
it's like a giant Unix command line filter on steroids. There are lots of
inputs, outputs, tees, queues, and merge sorts all connected together by a
master exec program. What else does Dryad have to offer the scalable
infrastructure wars?Dryad models programs as the execution of a directed
acyclic graph. Each vertex is a program and edges are typed communication
channels (files, TCP pipes, and shared memory channels within a process). Map-
reduce uses a different model. It's more like a large distributed sort where
the programmer defines functions for mapping, partitioning, and reducing. Each
approach seems to borrow from the spirit of its creating organization. The
graph approach seems a bit too complicated and map-reduce seems a bit too
simple. How ironic, in the Alanis Morissette sense.Dryad is a middleware layer
that executes gra</p><p>3 0.20311794 <a title="591-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-01-S3_for_image_storing.html">199 high scalability-2008-01-01-S3 for image storing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi all,Has anyone got any experience with using Amazon S3 as an uploaded photo
store?I'm writing a website that I need to keep as low budget as possible, and
I'm investigating solutions for storing uploaded photos from users - not too
many, probably in the low thousands. The site is commercial so I'm straying
away from the Flickrs of the world. S3 seems to offer a solution but I'd like
to hear from those who have used it before.ThanksAndy</p><p>4 0.19747131 <a title="591-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-06-DyradLINQ.html">592 high scalability-2009-05-06-DyradLINQ</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Neil Conwayfrom Berkeley CS is giving an advanced level talk ata meetup today
in San Francisco on a new paper: Logic and Lattices for Distributed
Programming \- extending set logic to support CRDT-style lattices. The
description of the meetup is probably the clearest introduction to the
paper:Developers are increasingly choosing datastores that sacrifice strong
consistency guarantees in exchange for improved performance and availability.
Unfortunately, writing reliable distributed programs without the benefit of
strong consistency can be very challenging. In this talk, I'll discuss work
from our group at UC Berkeley that aims to make it easier to write distributed
programs without relying on strong consistency. Bloom is a declarative
programming language for distributed computing, while CALM is an analysis
technique that identifies programs that are guaranteed to be eventually
consistent. I'll then discuss our recent work on extending CALM to support a
broader range of programs, drawin</p><p>6 0.095278174 <a title="591-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-08-Publish-subscribe_model_does_not_scale%3F.html">595 high scalability-2009-05-08-Publish-subscribe model does not scale?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In the never ending quest to figure out how to do something useful with never
ending streams of data, GraphLab: A New Framework For Parallel Machine
Learning wants to go beyond low-level programming, MapReduce, and dataflow
languages with a new parallel framework for ML (machine learning) which
exploits the sparse structure and common computational patterns of ML
algorithms. GraphLab enables ML experts to easily design and implement
efﬁcient scalable parallel algorithms by composing problem speciﬁc
computation, data-dependencies, and scheduling.  Our main contributions
include: A graph-based data model which simultaneously represents data and
computational dependencies. A set of concurrent access models which provide a
range of sequential-consistency guarantees. A sophisticated modular scheduling
mechanism. An aggregation framework to manage global state. From the

<p>Introduction: We are at the beginning of the multicore era. Computers will have increasingly
many cores (processors), but there is still no good programming framework for
these architectures, and thus no simple and unified way for machine learning
to take advantage of the potential speed up.In this paper, we develop a
broadly applicable parallel programming method, one that is easily applied to
many different learning algorithms. Our work is in distinct contrast to the
tradition in machine learning of designing (often ingenious) ways to speed up
a single algorithm at a time.Specifically, we show that algorithms that fit
the Statistical Query model can be written in a certain “summation form,”
which allows them to be easily parallelized on multicore computers. We adapt
Google’s map-reduce paradigm to demonstrate this parallel speed up technique
on a variety of learning algorithms including locally weighted linear
regression (LWLR), k-means, logistic regression (LR), naive Bayes (NB), SVM,
ICA, PCA, g</p><p>4 0.61684656 <a title="591-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-04-Is_MapReduce_going_mainstream%3F.html">401 high scalability-2008-10-04-Is MapReduce going mainstream?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Many web applications, including eBanking, Trading, eCommerce and Online
Gaming, face large, fluctuating loads. In this post will describe how to
achieve Right Sizing using virtualization and cloud computing. Will use a
standard JEE web application to demonstrate how auto-scaling works on AWS
Cloud without changing your application code.</p><p>same-blog 5 0.82072473 <a title="591-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-06-Dyrad.html">591 high scalability-2009-05-06-Dyrad</a></p>

<p>Introduction: InfoQueue has this  excellent talk by Brian Goetz  on the new features being added to Java SE 7 that will allow programmers to fully exploit our massively multi-processor future. While the talk is about Java it's really more general than that and there's a lot to learn here for everyone.  Brian starts with a short, coherent, and compelling explanation of why programmers can't expect to be saved by ever faster CPUs and why we must learn to exploit the strengths of multiple core computers to make our software go faster.   Some techniques for exploiting multiple cores are given in an equally  short, coherent, and compelling explanation of why divide and conquer as the secret to multi-core bliss, fork-join, how the Java approach differs from map-reduce, and lots of other juicy topics.   The multi-core "problem" is only going to get worse. Tilera founder Anant Agarwal  estimates by 2017  embedded processors could have 4,096 cores, server CPUs might have 512 cores and desktop chips could use</p><p>4 0.1997588 <a title="612-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-12-Google_TechTalk%3A_Amdahl%27s_Law_in_the_Multicore_Era.html">534 high scalability-2009-03-12-Google TechTalk: Amdahl's Law in the Multicore Era</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Over the last several decades computer architects have been phenomenally successful turning the transistor bounty provided by Moore's Law into chips with ever increasing single-threaded performance. During many of these successful years, however, many researchers paid scant attention to multiprocessor work. Now as vendors turn to multicore chips, researchers are reacting with more papers on multi-threaded systems. While this is good, we are concerned that further work on single-thread performance will be squashed.     To help understand future high-level trade-offs, we develop a corollary to Amdahl's Law for multicore chips [Hill & Marty, IEEE Computer 2008]. It models fixed chip resources for alternative designs that use symmetric cores, asymmetric cores, or dynamic techniques that allow cores to work together on sequential execution. Our results encourage multicore designers to view performance of the entire chip rather than focus on core efficiencies. Moreover, we observe that obtai</p><p>5 0.15766016 <a title="612-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-08-Art_of_Parallelism_presentation.html">652 high scalability-2009-07-08-Art of Parallelism presentation</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We are at the beginning of the multicore era. Computers will have increasingly many cores (processors), but there is still no good programming framework for these architectures, and thus no simple and unified way for machine learning to take advantage of the potential speed up.      In this paper, we develop a broadly applicable parallel programming method, one that is easily applied to many different learning algorithms. Our work is in distinct contrast to the tradition in machine learning of designing (often ingenious) ways to speed up a single algorithm at a time.      Specifically, we show that algorithms that fit the Statistical Query model can be written in a certain “summation form,” which allows them to be easily parallelized on multicore computers. We adapt Google’s map-reduce  paradigm to demonstrate this parallel speed up technique on a variety of learning algorithms including locally weighted linear regression (LWLR), k-means, logistic regression (LR), naive Bayes (NB), SVM</p><p>5 0.69596684 <a title="612-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-04-Is_MapReduce_going_mainstream%3F.html">401 high scalability-2008-10-04-Is MapReduce going mainstream?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It’s hardly news to anyone that product development and testing involve a lot of boring routine work, which can lead to human error. To avoid complications stemming from this, we use AIDA.
 
 AIDA  (Automated Interactive Deploy Assistant) is a utility that automatically performs many of the processes in Git, TeamCity and JIRA.
 
In this post, we focus on how through using AIDA we were able to automate multiple workflows and create a scheme of continuous integration.
 
We’ll start by looking at the version control system (VCS) we use here at Badoo, specifically how Git is used to automate creation of release branches, and their subsequent merging. Then we’ll discuss AIDA’s major contribution to both JIRA integration and TeamCity.
  Git flow  
The Badoo Team uses Git as a version control system. Our model ensures each task is developed and tested in a separate branch. The branch name consists of the ticket number in JIRA and a description of the problem.

<p>Introduction: 99designs  is a crowdsourced design contest marketplace based out of Melbourne Australia. The idea is that if you have a design you need created you create a contest and designers compete to give you the best design within your budget.
 
If you are a medium sized commerce site this is a clean example architecture of a site that reliably supports a lot of users and a complex workflow on the cloud. Lars Yencken wrote a nicely written overview of the architecture behind 99designs in  Infrastructure at 99designs . Here's a gloss on their architecture:
     Stats   
 Team has 8 devs, 2 dev ops, 2 ux/designers 
 Hundreds of thousands of unique visitors a month 
 Tens of millions pageviews a month 
   Stack   
 Largely an Amazon based stack 
 Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) 
 Varnish 
 PHP with Apache/mod_php 
 S3 
 Beanstalk for in-memory queing using Pheanstalk bindings 
 Amazon's RDS (MySQL) 
 Memcached 
 MongoDB  
 Redis 
 Rightscale/Chef

 Zynga is  now 20% Amazon and 80% their own cloud , reversing their previous approach of launching in Amazon for the spiky growth phase of a product and then folding it back in when growth rates stabilized. Follow the money... 
 Cost comparisons are like benchmarks, the only sure thing is that nothing is sure, but we usually still learning something anyway.

<p>Introduction: Update:   HostedFTP.com - Amazon S3 Performance Report . How fast is S3? Based on their own study HostedFTP.com has found: 10 to 12 MB/second when storing and receiving files and 140 ms per file stored as a fixed overhead cost.
   
  Update:   A Quantitative Comparison of Rackspace and Amazon Cloud Storage Solutions . S3 isn't the only cloud storage service out there. Mosso is saying they can save you so money while offering support. There are number of scenarios in their paper, but For 5TB of cloud storage Mosso will save you 17% over S3 without support and 42% with support. For their CDN on a Global test Mosso says the average response time is 333ms for CloudFront vs. 107ms for Cloud Files which means globally, Cloud Files is 3.1 times or 211% faster than CloudFront.   Amazon S3  is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.  This service allows you to link directly to files at a cost of 15 cents per GB of storage, and 20 cents per GB</p><p>6 0.9376514 <a title="612-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-21-PaaS_shouldn%E2%80%99t_be_built_in_Silos.html">977 high scalability-2011-01-21-PaaS shouldn’t be built in Silos</a></p>

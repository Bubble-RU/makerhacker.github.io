<p>Introduction: This is the intriguing quote by Bill Venners in an interview with Twitter's
Alex Payne on Twitter's heretical switch from a pure Ruby stack to a Ruby on
Rails stack on the front-end and JVM/Scala on the back-end:So performance was
also one of the problems with JRuby, which I [Bill Venners] think helps
explain better why they'd [Twitter] prefer Scala over Ruby or JRuby for some
things.I have often heard Rubyists say that although Ruby is slower than Java,
for many things it is plenty fast enough, and they are right. The logic goes
further, saying that servers are cheap, and programmers expensive, so it makes
sense to tradeoff some runtime performance for programmer productivity. And I
think that's very often true too, but not always.If you have enough traffic,
at some point the cost of servers outweighs the cost of programmers. I'm not
sure whether Twitter is past that point, but they get a lot of traffic. And
frankly this isn't an intrinsic tradeoff. Other dynamic languages are faster</p><p>3 0.23316926 <a title="568-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-07-Six_Ways_Twitter_May_Reach_its_Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal_of_One_Billion_Users.html">837 high scalability-2010-06-07-Six Ways Twitter May Reach its Big Hairy Audacious Goal of One Billion Users</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Twitter has a big hairy audacious goal of reaching one billion users by 2013.
Three forces stand against Twitter. The world will end in2012. But let's be
optimistic and assume we'll make it. Next is Facebook. Currently Facebook is
the user leader with over 400 million users. Will Facebook stumble or will
they rocket to one billion users before Twitter? And lastly, there's Twitter's
"low" starting point and "slow" growth rate. Twitter currently has106
millionregistered users and adds about 300,000 new users a day. That doesn't
add up to a billion in three years. Twitter needs to triple the number of
registered users they add per day. How will Twitter reach its goal of over one
billion users served?From recent infrastructure announcements and information
gleaned atChirp (videos) and other talks, it has become a little clearer how
they hope to reach their billion user goal: 1) Make a Big Hairy Audacious Goal
2) Hire Lots of Quality People 3) Hug Developers and Users 4) Drive the

<p>Introduction: Update 6:Some interesting changes from Twitter'sEvan Weaver: everything in RAM
now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by
average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page
cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with
Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every
external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to
load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability;
switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to
get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them
locally.Update 5:Twitter on Scala. A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex
Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners. A fascinating discussion of why
Twitter moved to the Java JVM for their server infrastructure (long lived
processes) and why they moved toScalato program against it (high level

<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting
system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by
advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide
guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see
how!Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed
in a format calledAlexandrian form which draws on constructs used by
Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:The pattern
nameThe problem the pattern is trying to solveContextSolutionExamplesDesign
rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why
experts use itPatterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context,
and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new
context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next
‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied. A pattern language is a structured
collection of such patterns that build o</p><p>6 0.14690745 <a title="568-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-19-Twitter_as_a_scalability_case_study.html">323 high scalability-2008-05-19-Twitter as a scalability case study</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A lot has been said already about Twitter's scalability issues. Many have
given Twitter as an anti-pattern of how not to deal with scalability and have
suggested different solutions for scaling it. As Twitter is famously a Ruby-
on-Rails deployment, this case has also been used as a weapon in the
language/platform wars between the RoR and Java camps, and to a lesser degree,
also with the LAMP (PHP) camp</p><p>3 0.82367492 <a title="568-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-18-QCon_London_2009%3A_Upgrading_Twitter_without_service_disruptions.html">544 high scalability-2009-03-18-QCon London 2009: Upgrading Twitter without service disruptions</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Can anyone convincingly explain why properties sporting traffic statistics
that may seem in-line with with the capabilities of a single big-iron machine
need so many machines in their architecture?This is a common reaction to
architecture profiles on High Scalability: I could do all that on a few
machines so they must be doing something really stupid. Lo and behold this
same reaction also occurred to the articleThe Architecture Twitter Uses to
Deal with 150M Active Users. On Hacker Newspapsosouid voiced what a lot of
people may have been thinking:I really question the current trend of creating
big, complex, fragile architectures to "be able to scale". These numbers are a
great example of why, the entire thing could run on a single server, in a very
straight forward setup. When you are creating a cluster for scalability, and
it has less CPU, RAM and IO than a single server, what are you gaining? They
are only doing 6k writes a second for crying out loud.This is a surprisingly
hard react</p><p>5 0.75848269 <a title="568-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-05-At_Some_Point_the_Cost_of_Servers_Outweighs_the_Cost_of_Programmers.html">556 high scalability-2009-04-05-At Some Point the Cost of Servers Outweighs the Cost of Programmers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There were many talks recently about twitter scalability and their specific
choice of language such as Scala to address their existing Ruby based
scalability. In this post i tried to provide a more methodical approach for
handling twitter scalability challenges that is centered around the right
choice of architecture patterns rather then the language itself.The
architecture pattern are given in a generic fashion that is not specific to
twitter itself and can serve anyone who is looking to build a scalable real
time web application in the near future.</p><p>2 0.93500674 <a title="568-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-12-Designing_Web_Applications_for_Scalability.html">877 high scalability-2010-08-12-Designing Web Applications for Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I can't even count the number of times that I've heard this phrase: "don't
worry about scaling your web application, worry about visitor (or customer)
acquisition." My response to this is always that you don't need to choose one
or the other, you can do both! In this post, I'm going to go over some of the
strategies I've used to architect web applications for scalability, right from
the start of the design process, in such a way that I'm prepared to scale when
I need to, but not forced into doing so before its necessary. Easing the
transition from small scale to large scale can be made much easier by choosing
the right technologies and implementing the right coding patterns up front.You
can read the full storehere.</p><p>3 0.93313295 <a title="568-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-20-Dependency_Injection_and_AOP_frameworks_for_.NET_.html">685 high scalability-2009-08-20-Dependency Injection and AOP frameworks for .NET </a></p>
<p>Introduction: We're looking to implement a framework to do Dependency Injection and AOP for
a new solution we're working on. It will likely get hit pretty hard, so we'd
like to chose a framework that's proven to scale well, and operates well under
pressure.Right now, we're looking closely at Spring.NET, Castle Project's
Windsor framework, and Unity. Does anyone have any feedback on implementing
any of these in large, high traffic environments?</p><p>4 0.93075228 <a title="568-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-19-Drupal%27s_Scalability_Makeover_-_You_give_up_some_control_and_you_get_back_scalability.html">724 high scalability-2009-10-19-Drupal's Scalability Makeover - You give up some control and you get back scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Drupal 7 is having a scalability makeover. Karoly Negyesi, Drupal Core
Developer and Public Development Team Lead, explains the process in this
video:Drupal 7 APIs, scalability mindset. Karoly states the general theme of
the changes as:You give up some control and you get back scalability. An
interesting comment on the politics of scalability?Makeover may not be quite
the right word though. A makeover implies a cosmetic change, looking better by
changing the surface. Drupal's changes will go deeper than that, right to
Drupal's core. It's a genuine and authentic change that will hopefully allow
one of the Internet's most venerable Content Management Systems (CMSs) to
compete with a constant stream of younger and sexier models.Drupal is based on
an older LAMP stack approach where PHP modules are scooped up and merged
together each time a request is made to Drupal. Drupal's most intriguing idea
is how it is built, expands, and changes byweaving together a single systemout

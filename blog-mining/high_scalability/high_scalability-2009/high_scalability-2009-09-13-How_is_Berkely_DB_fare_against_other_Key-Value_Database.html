<p>Introduction: After the filesystem and simple library packages likedbm, Berkeley DBwas the
original luxury embedded database widely used by applications as their core
database engine. NoSQL before NoSQL was cool. The hidden secret making complex
applications sing. If you want to dispense with all the network overhead of a
server based system, it's still a a good choice.There's a great writeup for
the architecture behind Berkeley DB in the book The Architecture of Open
Source Applications. If you want to understand more about how a database works
or if you are pondering how to build your own, it's rich in detail,
explanations, and lessons. Here's theBerkeley DB  chapter from the book. It
covers topics like: Architectural Overview; The Access Methods: Btree, Hash,
Recno, Queue; The Library Interface Layer; The Buffer Manager: Mpool; Write-
ahead Logging; The Lock Manager: Lock; The Log Manager: Log; The Transaction
Manager: Txn. Related Articles Berkeley DB: A Retrospective by Margo SeltzerOn

<p>Introduction: Hi, I aminterested in some experienced advice for choosing switches for a
colocated 2-tier architecture. I have the hardware chosen for the webservers,
app servers, and db servers, but need some advice on the network switch in
between:colocation port -> firewall(load balancer) -> 2+ web servers (app
servers) -> gigabit switch -> DB server(possibly cluster for future
expansion)the question is that I am just starting out, i wonder which
rackmount gigabit switch to select for the private LAN between the app server
-> DB servers. Do I need managed for that? Cisco switches are the best, but
they are the most expensive...I am looking at possibly using Dell/Netgear
gigabit switches.Thanks for any input</p><p>5 0.12508482 <a title="704-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-30-Olio_Web2.0_Toolkit_-_Evaluate_Web_Technologies_and_Tools.html">434 high scalability-2008-10-30-Olio Web2.0 Toolkit - Evaluate Web Technologies and Tools</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you evaluate and decide which web technologies (and there are myriads
out there) to use for your new web application, which one potentially gives
you the best performance, which one will likely give you the shortest time-to-
market? The Apache incubator projectOliomight help.Olio is a is an open source
web 2.0 toolkit to help evaluate the suitability, functionality and
performance of web technologies. Olio defines an example web2.0 application
(an events site somewhat like yahoo.com/upcoming) and provides three initial
implementations : PHP, Java EE and RubyOnRails (ROR). The toolkit also defines
ways to drive load against the application in order to measure
performance.Apache Olio could be used toUnderstand how to use various web 2.0
technologies such as AJAX, memcached, mogileFS etc. Use the code in the
application to understand the subtle complexities involved and how to get
around issues with these technologies.Evaluate the differences in the three
implementations: php, ruby</p><p>6 0.12482311 <a title="704-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-24-Habits_of_Highly_Scalable_Web_Applications_.html">637 high scalability-2009-06-24-Habits of Highly Scalable Web Applications </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi we are looking at sharding our existing Java/Oracle based application. We
are looking to make the app servers able to process requests for multiple
(any?) shard. The concern that has come up is the amount of memory that would
be consumed by having so many connection pools on one app server. Additionally
there is concern about having so many physical connections to the database
server coming from all the various app servers that may talk to that
particular shard. I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this issue and
how you resolved it?Thanks,Scott</p><p>6 0.5249809 <a title="704-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-28-Google_Voice_Architecture.html">640 high scalability-2009-06-28-Google Voice Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: InSecrets to Lightning Fast Mobile Design, Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger
shares three strategies Instagram uses to outsmart high latency mobile
networks and make mobile apps feel faster than they really are, which helped
Instagram reach 12 million users in 12 months:The motivation:"mobile
experiences fill gaps while we wait. no one wants to wait while they
wait"Perform actions optimistically. Make the user feel productive. Likes,
comments, and follows are registered on screen while the like operation is
being sent in the background. Adaptively preload content. Load content before
it's needed. Don't images according to time, it will take too long, instead
re-prioritize based on interest. Show what the social network things is the
most popular. Listen to what your user's flicks and taps are telling you.Move
bits when no-one is watching.Picture uploading startsbeforeyou share them,
most apps wait until after the share screen. The rule is send data as soon as
it's ready, then match it</p><p>3 0.61744225 <a title="704-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-17-Tachyon__-_Fault_Tolerant_Distributed_File_System_with_300_Times_Higher_Throughput_than_HDFS.html">1442 high scalability-2013-04-17-Tachyon  - Fault Tolerant Distributed File System with 300 Times Higher Throughput than HDFS</a></p>

theUC Berkeley AMP Lab:Tachyon is a fault tolerant distributed ďŹ le system
enabling reliable file sharing at memory-speed across cluster frameworks, such
as Spark and MapReduce.It offers up to 300 times higher throughput than HDFS,
by leveraging lineage information and using memory aggressively. Tachyon
caches working set files in memory, and enables different jobs/queries and
frameworks to access cached files at memory speed. Thus, Tachyon avoids going
to disk to load datasets that is frequently read.It has a Java-like File API,
native support for raw tables, a pluggable file system, and it works with
Hadoop with no modifications. It might work well for streaming media too as
you wouldn't have to wait for the complete file to hit the disk before
rendering.Discuss on Hacker News</p><p>4 0.60827726 <a title="704-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-08-Welcome_to_High_Scalability.html">2 high scalability-2007-07-08-Welcome to High Scalability</a></p>

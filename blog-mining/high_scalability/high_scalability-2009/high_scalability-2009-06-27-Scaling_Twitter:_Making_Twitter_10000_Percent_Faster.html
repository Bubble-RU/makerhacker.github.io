<p>Introduction: Twitter has a big hairy audacious goal of reaching one billion users by 2013.
Three forces stand against Twitter. The world will end in2012. But let's be
optimistic and assume we'll make it. Next is Facebook. Currently Facebook is
the user leader with over 400 million users. Will Facebook stumble or will
they rocket to one billion users before Twitter? And lastly, there's Twitter's
"low" starting point and "slow" growth rate. Twitter currently has106
millionregistered users and adds about 300,000 new users a day. That doesn't
add up to a billion in three years. Twitter needs to triple the number of
registered users they add per day. How will Twitter reach its goal of over one
billion users served?From recent infrastructure announcements and information
gleaned atChirp (videos) and other talks, it has become a little clearer how
they hope to reach their billion user goal: 1) Make a Big Hairy Audacious Goal
2) Hire Lots of Quality People 3) Hug Developers and Users 4) Drive the

<p>Introduction: Update:Jake inDoes Django really scale better than Rails?thinks apps like FFS
shouldn't need so much hardware to scale.In a short three months Friends for
Sale (think Hot-or-Not with a market economy) grew to become a top 10 Facebook
application handling 200 gorgeous requests per second and a stunning 300
million page views a month. They did all this using Ruby on Rails, two part
time developers, a cluster of a dozen machines, and a fairly standard
architecture. How did Friends for Sale scale to sell all those beautiful
people? And how much do you think your friends are worth on the open market?

<p>Introduction: This is the intriguing quote by Bill Venners in an interview with Twitter's
Alex Payne on Twitter's heretical switch from a pure Ruby stack to a Ruby on
Rails stack on the front-end and JVM/Scala on the back-end:So performance was
also one of the problems with JRuby, which I [Bill Venners] think helps
explain better why they'd [Twitter] prefer Scala over Ruby or JRuby for some
things.I have often heard Rubyists say that although Ruby is slower than Java,
for many things it is plenty fast enough, and they are right. The logic goes
further, saying that servers are cheap, and programmers expensive, so it makes
sense to tradeoff some runtime performance for programmer productivity. And I
think that's very often true too, but not always.If you have enough traffic,
at some point the cost of servers outweighs the cost of programmers. I'm not
sure whether Twitter is past that point, but they get a lot of traffic. And
frankly this isn't an intrinsic tradeoff. Other dynamic languages are faster</p><p>5 0.22339016 <a title="639-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-14-Designing_a_Scalable_Twitter.html">568 high scalability-2009-04-14-Designing a Scalable Twitter</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There were many talks recently about twitter scalability and their specific
choice of language such as Scala to address their existing Ruby based
scalability. In this post i tried to provide a more methodical approach for
handling twitter scalability challenges that is centered around the right
choice of architecture patterns rather then the language itself.The
architecture pattern are given in a generic fashion that is not specific to
twitter itself and can serve anyone who is looking to build a scalable real
time web application in the near future.</p><p>6 0.20513494 <a title="639-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-13-Why_are_Facebook%2C_Digg%2C_and_Twitter_so_hard_to_scale%3F.html">721 high scalability-2009-10-13-Why are Facebook, Digg, and Twitter so hard to scale?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Toy solutions solving Twitter's "problems" are a favorite scalability trope.
Everybody has this idea that Twitter is easy. With a little architectural hand
waving we have a scalable Twitter, just that simple. Well, it's not that
simple asRaffi Krikorian, VP of Engineering at Twitter, describes in his
superb and very detailed presentation onTimelines at Scale. If you want to
know how Twitter works - then start here.It happened gradually so you may have
missed it, but Twitter has grown up. It started as a strugglingthree-tierish
Ruby on Railswebsite to become a beautifully service driven core that we
actually go to now to see if other services are down. Quite a change.Twitter
now has 150M world wide active users, handles 300K QPS to generate timelines,
and a firehose that churns out 22 MB/sec. 400 million tweets a day flow
through the system and it can take up to 5 minutes for a tweet to flow from
Lady Gaga's fingers to her 31 million followers.A couple of points stood

<p>Introduction: Can anyone convincingly explain why properties sporting traffic statistics
that may seem in-line with with the capabilities of a single big-iron machine
need so many machines in their architecture?This is a common reaction to
architecture profiles on High Scalability: I could do all that on a few
machines so they must be doing something really stupid. Lo and behold this
same reaction also occurred to the articleThe Architecture Twitter Uses to
Deal with 150M Active Users. On Hacker Newspapsosouid voiced what a lot of
people may have been thinking:I really question the current trend of creating
big, complex, fragile architectures to "be able to scale". These numbers are a
great example of why, the entire thing could run on a single server, in a very
straight forward setup. When you are creating a cluster for scalability, and
it has less CPU, RAM and IO than a single server, what are you gaining? They
are only doing 6k writes a second for crying out loud.This is a surprisingly
hard react</p><p>5 0.82249296 <a title="639-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-05-At_Some_Point_the_Cost_of_Servers_Outweighs_the_Cost_of_Programmers.html">556 high scalability-2009-04-05-At Some Point the Cost of Servers Outweighs the Cost of Programmers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is the intriguing quote by Bill Venners in an interview with Twitter's
Alex Payne on Twitter's heretical switch from a pure Ruby stack to a Ruby on
Rails stack on the front-end and JVM/Scala on the back-end:So performance was
also one of the problems with JRuby, which I [Bill Venners] think helps
explain better why they'd [Twitter] prefer Scala over Ruby or JRuby for some
things.I have often heard Rubyists say that although Ruby is slower than Java,
for many things it is plenty fast enough, and they are right. The logic goes
further, saying that servers are cheap, and programmers expensive, so it makes
sense to tradeoff some runtime performance for programmer productivity. And I
think that's very often true too, but not always.If you have enough traffic,
at some point the cost of servers outweighs the cost of programmers. I'm not
sure whether Twitter is past that point, but they get a lot of traffic. And
frankly this isn't an intrinsic tradeoff. Other dynamic languages are faster</p><p>6 0.78538877 <a title="639-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-19-Twitter_as_a_scalability_case_study.html">323 high scalability-2008-05-19-Twitter as a scalability case study</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 6:Some interesting changes from Twitter'sEvan Weaver: everything in RAM
now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by
average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page
cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with
Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every
external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to
load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability;
switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to
get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them
locally.Update 5:Twitter on Scala. A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex
Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners. A fascinating discussion of why
Twitter moved to the Java JVM for their server infrastructure (long lived

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post derived from an email conversation withRussell Sullivan,
a computer architect and creator ofAlchemy Database,A Hybrid RDBMS/NOSQL-
Datastore.Russell (AKA Jak Sprats) has been pondering, considering, and
implementing distributed databases for many years. In a recent email
conversation he shared 44 of the lessons he has learned from developing the
infrastructure for high performance / highly scalable systems. Some are well
known, some are debatable, and some obviously result from a deep experience
that is worth learning from:There are maybe 20 classic bottlenecks (CPU, NIC
overload, memory fragmentation, disk seeks, swap, thread deadlock, packet
loss, etc.), have a basic understanding of them, because each is a dark
tunnel, and you need a specialised flashlight for each.The true style of
scalable architecture is rooted in the nature of bottlenecks. I always talk
aboutcommutative operationson a sharded relational model, and I figure if that
is in place, whatever is bu</p><p>5 0.99439371 <a title="639-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-05-Little%E2%80%99s_Law%2C_Scalability_and_Fault_Tolerance%3A_The_OS_is_your_bottleneck._What_you_can_do%3F.html">1591 high scalability-2014-02-05-Little’s Law, Scalability and Fault Tolerance: The OS is your bottleneck. What you can do?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guestrepostby Ron Pressler, the founder and CEO ofParallel Universe,
a Y Combinator company building advanced middleware for real-time
applications. Little's Law helps us determine the maximum request rate a
server can handle. When we apply it, we find that the dominating factor
limiting a server's capacity is not the hardware but theOS.Should we buy more
hardware if software is the problem? If not, how can we remove that software
limitation in a way that does not make the code much harder to write and
understand?Many modern web applications are composed of multiple (often
many)HTTPservices (this is often called a micro-service architecture). This
architecture has many advantages in terms of code reuse and maintainability,
scalability and fault tolerance. In this post I'd like to examine one
particular bottleneck in the approach, which hinders scalability as well as
fault tolerance, and various ways to deal with it (I am using the term
"scalability" very loosely in this post</p><p>6 0.99419576 <a title="639-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-30-Lavabit_Architecture_-_Creating_a_Scalable_Email_Service.html">551 high scalability-2009-03-30-Lavabit Architecture - Creating a Scalable Email Service</a></p>

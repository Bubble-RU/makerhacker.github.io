I'm investigating solutions for storing uploaded photos from users - not too
many, probably in the low thousands. The site is commercial so I'm straying
away from the Flickrs of the world. S3 seems to offer a solution but I'd like

<p>Introduction: The Future of the Parallelism and its ChallengesResearch and education in
Parallel computing technologies is more important than ever. Here I present a
perspective on the past contributions, current status, and future direction of
the parallelism technologies.While machine power will grow impressively,
increased parallelism, rather than clock rate, will be driving force in
computing in the foreseeable future. This ongoing shift toward parallel
architectural paradigms is one of the greatest challenges for the
microprocessor and software industries. In 2005, Justin Ratter, chief
technology officer of Intel Corporation, said ‘We are at the cusp of a
transition to multicore, multithreaded architectures, and we still have not
demonstrated the ease of programming the move will require…’Key points:A

<p>Introduction: Scale-up solutions in the form of large SMPs have represented the mainstream
of commercial computing for the past several years. The major server vendors
continue to provide increasingly larger and more powerful machines. More
recently, scale-out solutions, in the form of clusters of smaller machines,
have gained increased acceptance for commercial computing.Scale-out solutions
are particularly effective in high-throughput web-centric applications.In this
paper, we investigate the behavior of two competing approaches to parallelism,
scale-up and scale-out, in an emerging search application. Our conclusions

paper seeks to understand and design next-generation servers for emerging

put together a detailed evaluation infrastructure including a new benchmark
suite for warehouse-computing workloads, and detailed performance, cost, and

new solution that incorporates volume non-server-class components in novel
packaging solutions, with memory sharing andflash-based disk caching. Our

<p>Introduction: With more users interacting, working, purchasing, and communicating over the
network than ever before, Web 2.0 infrastructure is taking center stage in
many organizations. Demand is rising, and companies are looking for ways to
tackle the performance and scalability needs placed on Web infrastructure
without raising IT operational expenses. Today companies are turning to
efďŹ cient, high-performance, open source solutions as a way to decrease
acquisition, licensing, and other ongoing costs and stay within budget
constraints.</p><p>5 0.58619839 <a title="583-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-26-Map-Reduce_for_Machine_Learning_on_Multicore.html">581 high scalability-2009-04-26-Map-Reduce for Machine Learning on Multicore</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We are at the beginning of the multicore era. Computers will have increasingly
many cores (processors), but there is still no good programming framework for
these architectures, and thus no simple and unified way for machine learning
to take advantage of the potential speed up.In this paper, we develop a
broadly applicable parallel programming method, one that is easily applied to
many different learning algorithms. Our work is in distinct contrast to the
tradition in machine learning of designing (often ingenious) ways to speed up
a single algorithm at a time.Specifically, we show that algorithms that fit
the Statistical Query model can be written in a certain “summation form,”
which allows them to be easily parallelized on multicore computers. We adapt
Google’s map-reduce paradigm to demonstrate this parallel speed up technique
on a variety of learning algorithms including locally weighted linear
regression (LWLR), k-means, logistic regression (LR), naive Bayes (NB), SVM,
ICA, PCA, g</p><p>6 0.57958448 <a title="583-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-12-Paper%3A_Mind_the_Gap%3A_Reconnecting_Architecture_and_OS_Research.html">1039 high scalability-2011-05-12-Paper: Mind the Gap: Reconnecting Architecture and OS Research</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Scale-up solutions in the form of large SMPs have represented the mainstream
of commercial computing for the past several years. The major server vendors
continue to provide increasingly larger and more powerful machines. More
recently, scale-out solutions, in the form of clusters of smaller machines,
have gained increased acceptance for commercial computing.Scale-out solutions
are particularly effective in high-throughput web-centric applications.In this
paper, we investigate the behavior of two competing approaches to parallelism,
scale-up and scale-out, in an emerging search application. Our conclusions
show that a scale-out strategy can be the key to good performance even on a
scale-up machine.Furthermore, scale-out solutions offer better
price/performance, although at an increase in management complexity.Read more
about scaling out/up and about the conclusions here (PDF - you can also

What do you think about the future of similar solutions? Is Amazon EC2 and S3
ready for video streaming?I have found threads on their forums related to the
performance, scalability and high availability of the hosted streaming
solution. How would you make it scalable? Is it really cheaper than
traditional hosting?Looking forward to your thoughts!</p><p>5 0.79655564 <a title="583-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-07-Paper%3A_Tempest%3A_Scalable_Time-Critical_Web_Services_Platform.html">1544 high scalability-2013-11-07-Paper: Tempest: Scalable Time-Critical Web Services Platform</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An interesting and different implementation approach: Tempest: Scalable Time-
Critical Web Services Platform: Tempest is a new framework for developing
time-critical web services. Tempest enables developers to build scalable,
fault-tolerant services that can then be automatically replicated and deployed
across clusters of computing nodes. The platform automatically adapts to load
ďŹ&sbquo;uctuations, reacts when components fail, and ensures consistency between
replicas by repairing when inconsistencies do occur. Tempest relies on a
family of epidemic protocols and on Ricochet, a reliable time critical
multicast protocol with probabilistic guarantees.Tempest is built around a
novel storage abstraction called the TempestCollection in which application
developers store the state of a service. Our platform handles the replication
of this state across clones of the service, persistence, and failure handling.
To minimize the need for specialized knowledge on the part of the application
developer, th</p><p>6 0.77925581 <a title="583-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-07-Sun_Acquires_Q-layer_in_Cloud_Computing_Play.html">486 high scalability-2009-01-07-Sun Acquires Q-layer in Cloud Computing Play</a></p>

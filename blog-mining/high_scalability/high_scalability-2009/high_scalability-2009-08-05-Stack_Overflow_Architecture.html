<p>Introduction: A lot has happened since my first article on the Stack Overflow Architecture.
Contrary to the theme of that last article, which lavished attention on Stack
Overflow's dedication to a scale-up strategy, Stack Overflow has both grown up
and out in the last few years.Stack Overflow has grown up by more then
doubling in size to over 16 million users and multiplying its number of page
views nearly 6 times to 95 million page views a month.  Stack Overflow has
grown out by expanding into theStack Exchange Network, which includes Stack
Overflow, Server Fault, and Super User for a grand total of 43 different
sites. That's a lot of fruitful multiplying going on.What hasn't changed is
Stack Overflow's openness about what they are doing. And that's what prompted
this update. A recent series of posts talks a lot about how they've been
handling their growth: Stack Exchange's Architecture in Bullet Points, Stack
Overflow's New York Data Center, Designing For Scalability of Management and
Fault Tolera</p><p>3 0.2692256 <a title="671-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-10-24-StackExchange_Architecture_Updates_-_Running_Smoothly%2C_Amazon_4x_More_Expensive.html">1131 high scalability-2011-10-24-StackExchange Architecture Updates - Running Smoothly, Amazon 4x More Expensive</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We've had a few articles on theStackOverlflow Architecture and Stack Overflow
Architecture Update - Now at 95 Million Page Views a Month. Time for another
update. This time from a podcast. Every week or so Jeff, Joel and guests sit
around and converse. The result is a podcast. In a recent podcast they talked
about some of their recent architecture issues, problems, and updates. And
since I wrote this article before my vacation, they've also published a new
architecture update article:The Stack Exchange Architecture - 2011 Edition,
Episode 1.My overall impression is they are in a comfortable place, adding new
sites, adding new features, making a house a home.Notable for their scale-up
architecture, you might expect with their growth that they would slam into a
wall. Not so. They've been able to scale-up the power of individual servers by
adding more CPU and RAM. SSD has been added in some cases. Even their flagship
StackOverflow product runs on a single server.

<p>Introduction: The most common complaint against NoSQL is that if you know how to write good
SQL queries then SQL works fine. If SQL is slow you can always tune it and
make it faster. A great example of this incremental improvement process was
written up by StackExchange's Sam Saffron, in A day in the life of a slow page
at Stack Overflow, where he shows through profiling and SQL tuning it was
possible to reduce page load times from 630ms to 40ms for some pages and for
other pages the improvement was 100x.Sam provides a lot of wonderful detail of
his tuning process, how it works, the thought process, the tools used, and the
tradeoffs involved. Here's a short summary of the steps:Using theirmini-
profiler it was shown that abadge detail pagewas taking 630.3 ms to load,
298.1 ms of that was spent on SQL queries, and then the tool listed the SQL
queries for the page and how long each took.From the historical logs, which
are stored inHAProxy on a month-by-month basis, Sam was able to determine this

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-
grid.It's 2003: Add a caching layer.It's 2004: Add scale-out and
partitioning.It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a
distributed file system.It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.It's 2008: Cloud

<p>Introduction: We will be developing an RIA that will have a lot of database access. Think
something like a QuickBooks but with about 50 transactions entered per hour
per user. Users will be in the system for 7 to 9 hours a day and there will be
around 20,000 users, all logged in at the same time.Reporting will be done
just like a QuickBooks style app plus a lot of extra things you don't do in
QuickBooks.Our operations is familiar with W2003 Server and MS SQL Server so
they are recommending we stick with that. I originally requested Linux and
PostgreSQL.How far can a single database server get me? If we have a 4
processor, 8 core, 128gb server, how far am I going to get before I need to
shard or do something else? I know there are a lot of factors involved but in
general for this size of a site, what should the strategy be?I've read almost
all articles on this website but most of the applications are not RIA type of
apps with this type of usage or they are architectures for sites with millions

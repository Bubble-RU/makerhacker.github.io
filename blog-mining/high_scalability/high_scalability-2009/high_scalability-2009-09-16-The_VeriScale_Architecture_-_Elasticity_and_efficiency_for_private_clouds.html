<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear? For years startups, like the frenetically inventive age of the 17th</p><p>5 0.15755783 <a title="706-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-14-Private-Public_Cloud.html">444 high scalability-2008-11-14-Private-Public Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Data centers are reshaping themselves by taking ideas from public cloud
providers, such as Amazon and Google. The idea is to make the data center more
cost-effective by enabling on-demand utility-based computing rather than
dedicated machines. At the same time, it is clear that to make IT operations
more effective, it doesn't make sense to run all the applications that are
currently hosted in a company's data center in the private cloud. This calls
for an integration between private and public cloud. In this post i discuss
some of the challenges involved in making that happen:1. How do we design
applications to be cloud-agnostic?2. How do we enable seamless fail-over to a
public cloud?3. Future-proofing: There are many cases in which we can't make a
clear decision as to where our application should be running at the time of
writing or developing the application. We would like to be in a position to
change the decision as to where our application will be running even after our

<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points
for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2
and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products
can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes
configurations in detail using Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers with a
Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200
M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on
single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the
switches.These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's
expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain
constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to
the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are
only available through Sun's factory integration. Although the information

<p>Introduction: The modern datacenter is evolving into the network centric datacenter model,
which is applied to both public and private cloud computing. In this model,
networking, platform, storage, and software infrastructure are provided as
services that scale up or down on demand. The network centric model allows the
datacenter to be viewed as a collection of automatically deployed and managed
application services that utilize underlying virtualized services. Providing
sufficient elasticity and scalability for the rapidly growing needs of the
datacenter requires these collections of automatically-managed services to
scale efficiently and with essentially no limits, letting services adapt
easily to changing requirements and workloads. Sun's VeriScale architecture
provides the architectural platform that can deliver these capabilities. Sun
Microsystems has been developing open and modular infrastructure architectures
for more than a decade. The features of these architectures, such as
elasticity, ar</p><p>2 0.87553418 <a title="706-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-27-Hidden_History%3A_Driving_the_Last_Spike_of_the_Transcontinental_Railroad_was_an_Early_Version_of_the_Internet_of_Things.html">1555 high scalability-2013-11-27-Hidden History: Driving the Last Spike of the Transcontinental Railroad was an Early Version of the Internet of Things</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The story of driving thegolden spiketo symbolize the completion of
thetranscontinental railroad is famous in the US. What is not so well known is
the story of how it also foreshadowed changes to come as an early version of
both the Internet and the Internet of Things. But that was 1869, how can that
possibly be?Telegraph as InternetFirst, let's establish the telegraph and
cable systems was an early version of an Internet.As railroad tracks were
being laid atranscontental telegraphsystem was also being constructed.
Telegraph lines were installed parallel to the tracks making instant
communication available across the continent, faster than any horse could
ride.With the transalantic cable system information could quickly span
continents in minutes:The miles of American telegraph grew from 40 in 1846 to
12,000 in 1850 to 23,000 in 1852. In Europe it increased from 2,000 in 1849 to
110,000 in 1869. The cost of sending 10 words was $1.55 in 1850, $1 in 1870,

ways to drive load against the application in order to measure
performance.Apache Olio could be used toUnderstand how to use various web 2.0

<p>Introduction: The Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Group had a meetup Wednesday onOpenStack,
whose tag line isthe open source, open standards cloud. I was shocked at the
large turnout. 287 people registered and it looked like a large percentage of
them actually showed up. I wonder, was it the gourmet pizza, the free
t-shirts, or are people really that interested in OpenStack? And if they are
really interested, why are they that interested? On the surface an open cloud
doesn't seem all that sexy a topic, but with contributions from NASA, from
Rackspace, and from a very avid user community, a lot of interest there seems
to be. The brief intro blurb to OpenStack is:OpenStack allows any organization
to create and offer cloud computing capabilities using open source software
running on standard hardware. OpenStack Compute is software for automatically
creating and managing large groups of virtual private servers. OpenStack
Storage is software for creating redundant, scalable object storage using

<p>Introduction: Looks interesting...Abstract:Today's data centers may contain tens of
thousands of computers with significant aggregate bandwidth requirements. The
network architecture typically consists of a tree of routing and switching
elements with progressively more specialized and expensive equipment moving up
the network hierarchy. Unfortunately, even when deploying the highest-end IP
switches/routers, resulting topologies may only support 50% of the aggregate
bandwidth available at the edge of the network, while still incurring
tremendous cost. Nonuniform bandwidth among data center nodes complicates
application design and limits overall system performance.In this paper, we
show how to leverage largely commodity Ethernet switches to support the full
aggregate bandwidth of clusters consisting of tens of thousands of elements.
Similar to how clusters of commodity computers have largely replaced more
specialized SMPs and MPPs, we argue that appropriately architected and
interconnected commodity s</p><p>6 0.83555824 <a title="706-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-09-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_9th%2C_2014.html">1645 high scalability-2014-05-09-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 9th, 2014</a></p>

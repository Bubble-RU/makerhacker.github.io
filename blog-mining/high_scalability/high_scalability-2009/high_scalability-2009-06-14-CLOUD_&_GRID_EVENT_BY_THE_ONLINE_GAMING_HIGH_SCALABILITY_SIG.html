<p>Introduction: CloudCampis an interesting unconference where early adapters of Cloud
Computing technologies exchange ideas. With the rapid change occurring in the
industry, we need a place we can meet to share our experiences, challenges and
solutions. At CloudCamp, you are encouraged you to share your thoughts in
several open discussions, as we strive for the advancement of Cloud Computing.
End users, IT professionals and vendors are all encouraged to
participate.CloudCamp Silicon Valley 08is scheduled for Tuesday, September 30,
2008 from 06:00 PM - 10:00 PM in Sun Microsystems' EBC Briefing Center15
Network CircleMenlo Park, CA 94025CloudCamp follows an interactive, unscripted
unconference format. You can propose your own session or you can attend a
session proposed by someone else. Either way, you are encouraged to engage in
the discussion and “Vote with your feet”, which means … “find another session
if you don’t find the session helpful”. Pick and choose from the

<p>Introduction: The GigaOM Network today announces its second Structure conference after the
runaway success of the 2008 event. The Structure 09 conference returns to San
Francisco, Calif., on June 25th, 2009.Structure 09 (http://structureconf.com)
is a conference designed to explore the next generations of Internet
infrastructure. Over a year ago, The GigaOM Network Founder Om Malik saw that
the platforms on which we have done business for over a decade were starting
to provide diminishing returns, and smart money was seeking new options.
Structure 09 looks at the changing needs and rapid growth in the Internet
infrastructure sector, and this year's event will consider the impact of the
global economy. "I cannot remember a time when a new technology had so much
relevance to our industry as cloud computing does in the current economic
climate," said The GigaOM Network Founder Om Malik. "We all need to find ways
to leverage what we have and cut costs without compromising future options.

<p>Introduction: Which of the many conferences should you attend? I get this question a lot, so
I compiled a list. The list isn't life, it's not a top 10, and it won't say if
a conference is naughty or nice, but they are conferences I know about, have
attended, or referenced in an article. By no means is this list exhaustive. If
you know of a conference people should consider attending, please add them in
the comments. If you have an opinion about a particular conference, please
comment on that too.Some have a low opinion of conferences. I'm not one of
them. Sure, some conferences can be a waste of time, and those should fade
away. And sure, we see a lot more conference-as-monetization strategy these
days. But it's conferences that help motivate people to do their best work.
Would we see even half the slide decks, papers, or talks describing how people
do what they do without conferences as motivation? No we would not. Taking all
that wisdom and stuffing it into a presentations is surprisingly hard wor</p><p>6 0.64047146 <a title="629-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-22-Coming_soon%3A_better_JRockit%2BCoherence_integration.html">499 high scalability-2009-01-22-Coming soon: better JRockit+Coherence integration</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The first meeting of this Online Gaming High Scalability SIG will be on the
9th of July 2009 in central London, starting at 10 AM and finishing around
5PM.The main topic of this meeting will be potentials for using cloud and grid
technologies in online gaming systems. In addition to experience reports from
the community, we have invited some of the leading cloud experts in the UK to
discuss the benefits such as resource elasticity and challenges such as
storage and security that companies from other industries have experienced. We
will have a track for IT managers focused on business opportunities and issues
and a track for architects and developers more focused on implementation
issues.The event is free but up-front registration is required for capacity
planning, so please let us know in advance, if you are planning to attend by

<p>Introduction: Which of the many conferences should you attend? I get this question a lot, so
I compiled a list. The list isn't life, it's not a top 10, and it won't say if
a conference is naughty or nice, but they are conferences I know about, have
attended, or referenced in an article. By no means is this list exhaustive. If
you know of a conference people should consider attending, please add them in
the comments. If you have an opinion about a particular conference, please
comment on that too.Some have a low opinion of conferences. I'm not one of
them. Sure, some conferences can be a waste of time, and those should fade
away. And sure, we see a lot more conference-as-monetization strategy these
days. But it's conferences that help motivate people to do their best work.
Would we see even half the slide decks, papers, or talks describing how people
do what they do without conferences as motivation? No we would not. Taking all
that wisdom and stuffing it into a presentations is surprisingly hard wor</p><p>5 0.63902199 <a title="588-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-07-Sun_Acquires_Q-layer_in_Cloud_Computing_Play.html">486 high scalability-2009-01-07-Sun Acquires Q-layer in Cloud Computing Play</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The GigaOM Network today announces its second Structure conference after the
runaway success of the 2008 event. The Structure 09 conference returns to San
Francisco, Calif., on June 25th, 2009.Structure 09 (http://structureconf.com)
is a conference designed to explore the next generations of Internet
infrastructure. Over a year ago, The GigaOM Network Founder Om Malik saw that
the platforms on which we have done business for over a decade were starting
to provide diminishing returns, and smart money was seeking new options.
Structure 09 looks at the changing needs and rapid growth in the Internet
infrastructure sector, and this year's event will consider the impact of the
global economy. "I cannot remember a time when a new technology had so much
relevance to our industry as cloud computing does in the current economic
climate," said The GigaOM Network Founder Om Malik. "We all need to find ways
to leverage what we have and cut costs without compromising future options.

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectivesis a series of posts that highlights the ideas that
will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires
an open mind.Werner VogelsDr. Werner Vogels is Vice President & Chief
Technology Officer at Amazon.com where he is responsible for driving the
company’s technology vision, which is to continuously enhance the innovation
on behalf of Amazon’s customers at a global scale. Prior to joining Amazon, he
worked as a researcher at Cornell University where he was a principal
investigator in several research projects that target the scalability and
robustness of mission-critical enterprise computing systems. He is regarded as
one of the world's top experts on ultra-scalable systems and he uses his
weblog to educate the community about issues such as eventual consistency.

<p>Introduction: A bit over a month ago Amazon experienced its infamous AWS outage in the US
East Region. As a cloud evangelist, I was intrigued by the history of the
outage as it occurred. There were great posts during and after the outage from
those who went down. But more interestingly for me as architect were the
detailed posts of those who managed to survive the outage relatively unharmed,
such as SimpleGeo, Netflix,SmugMug, SmugMug's CTO, Twilio, Bizo and
others.Reading through the experience of others, I tried to summarize
thepatterns, principles and best practicesthat emerged from these posts, as I
believe we can learn a lot from them on how to design our business
applications to truly leverage on the benefits that the cloud offers in high
availability and scalability.The main principles, patterns and best practices
are:Design for failureStateless and autonomous servicesRedundant hot copies

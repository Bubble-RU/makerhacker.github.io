<p>Introduction: The ever amazingslime moldis not the only way to solve complex compute
problems without performing calculations. There is another:soap film.
Unfortunately for soap film it isn't nearly as photogenic as slime mold, all
we get are boring looking pictures, but the underlying idea is still
fascinating and ten times less spooky.As a quick introduction we'll lean on
Long Ouyang, who has really straightforward  explanation of how soap film
works inApproaching P=NP: Can Soap Bubbles Solve The Steiner Tree Problem In
Polynomial.It's computers, so playing the role of the motivating graph problem
we have theSteiner tree problem, which Ouyang explains as:Find the minimum
spanning tree for a bunch of vertices, given that you can add additional
points.Soap helps solve this problem because:Soap, in water, acts a
surfactant, which decreases the surface tension in water.This acts to minimize
the surface energy of the liquid.This should minimize surface area (graph
weight), and solve the problem.Dip two</p><p>3 0.12850313 <a title="620-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-02-Multilanguage_Website.html">54 high scalability-2007-08-02-Multilanguage Website</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Warning, this post is a bit vendor FUDy, but SSL is an important topic and it
does bring up some issues worth arguing about. Hacker News has agood

than 30,000 miles on it.Yes, you heard that right, less than 30,000 miles. I
don't drive my car very often because, well, my commute is a short trip down
two flights of stairs. I don't need to go very far when I do drive it's only
ten miles or so round trip to the grocery store. So from my perspective, gas
isn't really very expensive. I may use a tank of gas a month, which works out
to â€¦ well, it's really not even worth mentioning the cost. But for someone who
commutes every day - especially someone who commutes a long-distance every day
- gas is expensive. It's a significant expense every month for them and they

<p>Introduction: Server farms achieve high scalability and high availability through server
load balancing, a technique that makes the server farm appear to clients as a
single server. In this two-part article, Gregor Roth explores server load
balancing architectures, with a focus on open source solutions. Part 1 covers
server load balancing basics and discusses the pros and cons of transport-
level server load balancing.The barrier to entry for many Internet companies
is low. Anyone with a good idea can develop a small application, purchase a
domain name, and set up a few PC-based servers to handle incoming traffic. The
initial investment is small, so the start-up risk is minimal. But a successful
low-cost infrastructure can become a serious problem quickly. A single server
that handles all the incoming requests may not have the capacity to handle
high traffic volumes once the business becomes popular. In such a situations
companies often start to scale up: they upgrade the existing infrastructure by</p><p>3 0.7171464 <a title="620-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-11-Sharding_and_Connection_Pools.html">532 high scalability-2009-03-11-Sharding and Connection Pools</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi we are looking at sharding our existing Java/Oracle based application. We
are looking to make the app servers able to process requests for multiple
(any?) shard. The concern that has come up is the amount of memory that would
be consumed by having so many connection pools on one app server. Additionally
there is concern about having so many physical connections to the database
server coming from all the various app servers that may talk to that
particular shard. I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this issue and
how you resolved it?Thanks,Scott</p><p>4 0.68981457 <a title="620-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-09-High_Load_on_production_Webservers_after_Sourcecode_sync.html">118 high scalability-2007-10-09-High Load on production Webservers after Sourcecode sync</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi everybody :)We have a bunch of webservers (about 14 at this time) running
Apache. As application framework we're using PHP with the APC Cache installed
to improve performance. For load balancing we're using a Big F5 system with
dynamic ratio (SNMP driven)To sync new/updated sourcecode we're using
subversion to "automaticly" update these servers with our latest software
relases. After updating the new source to these production servers the load of
the mashines is raising to hell.While updating the servers, they are still in
"production", serving webpages to the users. Otherwise the process of updating
would take ages. Most of the time we're only updating in the morning hours
while less users are online, because of the above issue.My guess is, that the
load is raising that high, because APC needs to recompile a bunch of new files
each time. Before and while compiling the performance simply is "bad".My goal
would be to find a better solution. We want to "sync" code no matter how many

<p>Introduction: In his blog post,Scaling WSO2 Stratos, Srinath Perera explains the scaling
architecture of the WSO2 Stratos Platform as a Service (PaaS) infrastructure.
It is explained as a series of solutions where every solution adds a new
concept to solve a specific problem found in the earlier solution.Overall,
WSO2 Stratos uses a combination of intelligent Load balancing and lazy loading
to scale up the architecture. More details about Stratos can be found from the
paper WSO2 Stratos: An Industrial Stack to Support Cloud Computing.
ProblemStratos is multi-tenanted. In other words, there are many tenants. Each
tenant generally represents an organization and isolated from other tenants,
where each tenant has his own users, resources, and permissions. Stratos
supports multiple PaaS services. Each PaaS service is actually a WSO2 Products
(e.g. AS, BPS, ESB etc.) offered as a service. Using those services, tenants
may deploy their own Web Services, Mediation logic, Workflows, and Gadgets
etc. WSO2 Str</p><p>6 0.67355716 <a title="620-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-04-Try_Squid_as_a_Reverse_Proxy.html">59 high scalability-2007-08-04-Try Squid as a Reverse Proxy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There's a new clustered file system on the spindle:Kosmos File System (KFS).
Thanks to Rich Skrenta for turning me on to KFS and I think his blogpostsays
it all. KFS is an open source project written in C++ by search startupKosmix.
The team members have a goodpedigreeso there's a better than average chance
this software will be worth considering.After you stop trying to turn KFS into
"Kentucky Fried File System" in your mind, take a look at KFS' intriguing
feature set:breakIncremental scalability: New chunkserver nodes can be added
as storage needs increase; the system automatically adapts to the new
nodes.Availability: Replication is used to provide availability due to chunk
server failures. Typically, files are replicated 3-way.Per file degree of
replication: The degree of replication is configurable on a per file basis,
with a max. limit of 64.Re-replication: Whenever the degree of replication for
a file drops below the configured amount (such as, due to an extended

<p>Introduction: How do you keep a system small enough, while still being successful, that a
simple scale-up strategy becomes the preferred architecture?StackOverflow, for
example, could stick with a tool chain they were comfortable with because they
had a natural brake on how fast they could grow: there are only so many
programmers in the world. If this doesn't work for you, here's another natural
braking strategy to consider:charge for your service.Paul Houlesummarized this
nicely as:avoid scaling problems by building a service that's profitable at a
small scale.This interesting point, one I hadn't properly considered before,
was brought up by Maciej Ceglowski, co-founder ofPinboard.in, in an interview
with Leo Laporte and Amber MacArthur on their theirnet@nightshow.Pinboard is a
lean, mean, pay for bookmarking machine, a timely replacement for the nearly
departed Delicious. And as a self professed anti-social bookmarking site, it
emphasizes speed over socializing. Maciej considers Pinboard a persona</p><p>3 0.91404557 <a title="620-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-31-Designing_for_Resiliency_will_be_so_2013.html">1379 high scalability-2012-12-31-Designing for Resiliency will be so 2013</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A big part of engineering for a quality experience is bringing in thelong
tail. An improbable severe failure can ruin your experience of a site, even if
your average experience is quite good. That's where building for resilience
comes in. Resiliency used to be outside the realm of possibility for the
common system. It was simply too complex and too expensive.An evolution has
been underway, making 2013 possibly the first time resiliency is truly on the
table as a standard part of system architectures. We are getting the clouds,
we are getting the tools, and prices are almost low enough.Even Netflix,real
leadersin the resiliency architecture game, took some heat for relying
completely on Amazon's ELB and not having a backup load balancing system,
leading to a prolonged Christmas Eve failure. Adrian Cockcroft, Cloud
Architect at Netflix, said they've investigated creating their own load
balancing service, but that "we try not to invest in undifferentiated heavy
lifting."So resiliency is s</p><p>same-blog 4 0.91216534 <a title="620-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-05-SSL_RPC_API_Scalability.html">620 high scalability-2009-06-05-SSL RPC API Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi all!So nice to start discussing cool things in this even cooler forum :)I
am having a problem .. which i believe is already solved but i would love
someone confirming actual experience with the same topic.We are building a
client / server architecture, consisting of a web server part and many
clients.Transport will be provided as either XML-RPC / SOAP / JSON or all at
once.All of the communication has to be encrypted and passed within SSL3.We
expect a high load when the application starts (> 2000 concurrent
requests).Combine this with xml parsing for the rpc api, things really look
ugly :)So it's a big mess :)It will not be that much database bound behind the
api - mostly files will be transferred from the server to the clients and
simple api for control.So it's pretty much a matter of 'what-to-do-with-ssl'.I
was thinking of hardware - NetApp or a similar application accelerator.Can
anyone give examples of a hardware piece that combines: Load balancer / SSL
accelerator?I have also b</p><p>5 0.90153635 <a title="620-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-04-7_Life_Saving_Scalability_Defenses_Against_Load_Monster_Attacks.html">1415 high scalability-2013-03-04-7 Life Saving Scalability Defenses Against Load Monster Attacks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We talked about42 Monster Problems That Attack As Loads Increase. Here are a
few ways you can defend yourself, secrets revealed by scaling masters across
the ages. Note that these are low level programming level moves, not large
architecture type strategies.Use Resources Proportional To a Fixed LimitThis
is probably the most important rule for achieving scalability within an
application. What it means:Find the resource that has a fixed limit that you
know you can support. For example, a guarantee to handle a certain number of
objects in memory. So if we always use resources proportional to the number of
objects it is likely we can prevent resource exhaustion.Devise ways of tying
what you need to do to the individual resources.Some examples:Keep a list of
purchase orders with line items over $20 (or whatever). Do not keep a list of
the line items because the number of items can be much larger than the number
of purchase orders. You have kept the resource usage proportional to the
number</p><p>6 0.88862914 <a title="620-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-25-The_Big_List_of_Articles_on_the_Amazon_Outage.html">1029 high scalability-2011-04-25-The Big List of Articles on the Amazon Outage</a></p>

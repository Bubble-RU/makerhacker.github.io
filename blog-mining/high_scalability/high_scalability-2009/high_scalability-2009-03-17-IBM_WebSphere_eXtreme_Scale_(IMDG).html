<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ashwanth Fernando, Software Engineer from the trenches
at large scale internet companies.Inspired by the book "Effective Java" by
Joshua Bloch, I wanted to share my holistic recommendations on building high
traffic web software (i.e. web applications/services that serve high traffic
loads). Some of these items may not be just about software design but also
around surrounding areas such as the engineering organization, culture etc.Two
disclaimers up front:1) This is my opinion.2) There will be real world
situations where the below principles will be wrong as in all things
"software". Please use common sense all the time.Consider using more than one
datacenterThere have been numerous horror stories about businesses, ahem going
out of business because they just had a single datacenter. Its really
important to have more than one data center if you want to protect yourself
from natural disasters or electrical supply failures. Run all your datacenters

<p>Introduction: I've been getting asked about this a lot lately so I figured I'd just blog
about it. Products like WebSphere eXtreme Scale work by taking a dataset,
partitioning it using a key and then assigning those partitions to a number of
JVMs. Each partition usually has a primary and a replica. These 'shards' are
assigned to JVMs. A transactional application typically interacts with the
data on a single partition at a time. This means the transaction is executed
in a single JVM. A server box will be able to do M of those transactions per
second and it scales because N boxes does MN (M multiplied by N) transactions
per second. Increase N, you get more transactions per second. Availability is
very good because a transaction only depends on 1 of the N servers that are
currently online. Any of the other (N-1) servers can go down or fail with no
impact on the transaction. So, single partition transactions can scale
indefinitely from a throughput point of view, offer very consistent response
times and</p><p>6 0.12999696 <a title="542-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-31-Squarespace_Architecture_-_A_Grid_Handles_Hundreds_of_Millions_of_Requests_a_Month_.html">691 high scalability-2009-08-31-Squarespace Architecture - A Grid Handles Hundreds of Millions of Requests a Month </a></p>

<p>Introduction: GridGainwas kind enough to present at the September 17th instance of
theSilicon Valley Cloud Computing Group. I've been curious about GridGain so I
was glad to see them there. In short GridGain is:an open source computational
grid framework that enables Java developers to improve general performance of
processing intensive applications by splitting and parallelizing the workload.
GridGain can also be thought of as a set of middleware primitives for building
applications. GridGain's peer group of competitors includes GigaSpaces,
Terracotta, Coherence, and Hadoop.The speaker for GridGain was the President
and Founder, Nikita Ivanov. He has a very pleasant down-to-earth way about him
that contrasts nicely with a field given to religious discussions of complex
taxomic definitions. Nikita first talked about cloud computing in general. He
feels Java is the perfect gateway for cloud computing. Which is good
becauseGridGain only works with Java. The Java centricity of GridGain may be

<p>Introduction: With the Chapultepec aqueduct, also namedthe great aqueduct, theAztecsbuilt a
novel uninterruptible water supply for providing fresh water to Tenochtitlan,
their fast growing jewel of a capital city. A section of the aqueduct is still
around today: It's fun to think about how even 600 years ago how it was built
with high availability in mind. We findengineers being engineers, no matter
the age:It consisted of a twin pipe distribution system made in part of
compacted soil and in part of wood for the crossings of the aqueduct over the
bridges built to allow the passage of the canoes. It was finished around 1466
AD, and the main purpose was to supply fresh water to Mexico-Tenochtitlan, to
mitigate its thirst.The main source for the aqueduct was the spring of
Chapultepec and the purpose of the twin pipes was to ease the maintenance of
the system, because the water was conveyed through one pipe, and when it got
dirty, the water was diverted to the other pipe while the dirty pipe was
cleaned</p><p>2 0.94940656 <a title="542-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-10-MONO_ASP.NET._Will_it_make_the_web%3F%3F%3F.html">206 high scalability-2008-01-10-MONO ASP.NET. Will it make the web???</a></p>

<p>Introduction: IBM WebSphere eXtreme Scale is IBMs in memory data grid product (IMDG). It can
be used as a key-value store which partitions the keys (using a form of
consistent hashing) over a set of servers such that each server is responsible
for a subset of the keys. It automatically handles replication which can be
either synchronous of asynchronous and handles advanced placement so that
replicas can be placed in different physical zones when compared to the
placement of the primary. Think buildings, racks, floor, data centers.It is
fully elastic in that servers can be added and removed and it automatically
redistributes the partition primaries and backups. It can be scaled from one
server to hundreds if not thousands of JVMs in a single grid. Each additional
server provides more CPU, memory capacity and network and it scales linearly
with grid growth.It also has a key-graph mode where a graph of objects can be
associated with a single key and it allows fine grained modification of that
graph.

<p>Introduction: Judging from the tweet flow, Velocitylooked like a riotous good time. In this
video on themain themes at Velocity, after a little microphone enhanced
violence, John Allspaw and Steve Souders identifyresilienceandautomationas two
of the big ideas behind building a faster and stronger web.John says
resiliency is the idea that we we don't live in a perfect world so trying to
build perfect systems is counter productive. We have to accept failure as a
baseline and think in terms of degrees of availability. All abstraction layers
leak so every part of a system must be monitorable and open to introspection.A
focus on resilience means the web is growing up. Resilience has long been a
requirement for "real" systems, it's great to see the web thinking in terms of
the complex systems they've always been. For the Alpha and Omega on resilience
you'll want to watchDr. Richard Cook'sinspiring talk on How Complex Systems
Fail. Here are some of the most enjoyable Quotable Quotes from
Velocity:@guypod:</p><p>5 0.93218338 <a title="542-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-02-YouPorn_-_Targeting_200_Million_Views_a_Day_and_Beyond.html">1220 high scalability-2012-04-02-YouPorn - Targeting 200 Million Views a Day and Beyond</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: Here's thevideo of the talk.Erick Pickup, lead developer at
YouPorn.com, presented their architecture in a talk titledBuilding a Website
To Scalegiven at theConFooconference.  As you might expect, YouPorn is a
beast, streaming three full DVDs of video every second, handing 300K queries
every second, and generating up to 15GBs of log data per hour.Unfortunately,
all we have are the slides of the talk, so this article isn't as technical as
I might like, there's no visibility at all on the video handling for example,
but we do get some interesting details.The most interesting takeway is that
YouPorn is a pretty conventional LAMP stack, with a NoSQL twist as Redis now
replaces MySQL in the live datapath. Reminds me a little ofYouTubein its
simplicity.The second most interesting takeaway was thegreat switchover.
Common wisdom says never rewrite, but in 2011 YouPorn rewrote their entire
site to use PHP + Redis instead of a complex Perl + MySQL based architecture.
And by all accounts</p><p>6 0.90212244 <a title="542-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-22-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_22%2C_2011.html">1028 high scalability-2011-04-22-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 22, 2011</a></p>

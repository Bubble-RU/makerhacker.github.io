<p>Introduction: Google App Engine (GAE) is focused on making development easy, but limits your options. Amazon Web Services is focused on making development flexible, but complicates the development process. Real enterprise applications require both of these paradigms to achieve success… What we really want is the flexibility of AWS and the simplicity of GAE.

<p>Introduction: Update 2 : Read/WriteWeb  has a good article talking about the scalability issues of relational databases and how Dynamo solves them:  Amazon Dynamo: The Next Generation Of Virtual Distributed Storage . But since Dynamo is just another frustrating walled garden protected by barbed wire and guard dogs, its relevance is somewhat overstated.   Update :  Greg Linden  has a take on the paper where he questions some of Amazon's design choices: emphasizing write availability over fast reads, a lack of indexing support, use of random distribution for load balancing,  and punting on some scalability issues.  Werner Vogels, Amazon's avuncular CTO, just announced a new  paper  on the internal database technology Amazon uses to handle tens of millions customers. I'll dive into more details later, but I thought you'd want to read it hot off the blog. The bad news is it won't be a service. They are keeping this tech not so secret, but very safe. Happily, it's another real-life example to learn from.</p><p>6 0.08899717 <a title="485-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-06-Sponsored_Post%3A_BlueStripe%2C_Apple%2C_Surge%2C_Change%2C_Booking%2C_Rackspace%2C_aiCache%2C_Aerospike%2C_ScaleOut%2C_New_Relic%2C_LogicMonitor%2C_AppDynamics%2C_ManageEngine%2C_Site24x7.html">1497 high scalability-2013-08-06-Sponsored Post: BlueStripe, Apple, Surge, Change, Booking, Rackspace, aiCache, Aerospike, ScaleOut, New Relic, LogicMonitor, AppDynamics, ManageEngine, Site24x7</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It seems that HTTP calls have become a default way to think about distributed systems. HTTP and Web services definitely have a lot to offer, but they are not the only way to do things and there are definitely cases where web is not the right choice.  Unfortunately, lots of people just stick with web services and hack on, trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. In cases such as these, a different distribution paradigm can save us quite a lot of time and effort both in development and later in maintenance.

<p>Introduction: If you are Google you don't just complain about performance on the web, you do something about it. Doing something about web performance is the job of one  Ilya Grigorik , Developer Advocate,  Make the Web Fast  at Google, and author of a great new book:  High Performance Browser Networking: What every web developer should know about networking and web performance . 
 
That's a big topic you might be saying to yourself. And it is. The book is 400 plus information packed pages. But never fear. Ilya writes in a very straightforward style. It’s like a man page for the web. Which is a good thing.
 
In case you are not familiar with Ilya, he's the perfect choice for writing such an ambitious book. For years Ilya has been producing excellent content on  his blog  and if you  search YouTube  you'll find presentation after presentation on the topics found in the book. Authority established.
 
Reading the book I was struck by what a complicated beast or little World Wide Web has become.

We are looking to hire an outside firm to help with development of a scalable and potentially high-traffic web site.

<p>Introduction: There have been reports that  software engineering is dead . Maybe, like the future, software engineering is simply not evenly distributed? When you read this paper I think you'll agree there is some real engineering going on, it's just that most of the things we need to build do not require real engineering. Much like my old childhood tree fort could be patched together and was "good enough." This brings to mind the old joke: If a software tree falls in the woods would anyone hear it fall? Only if it tweeted on the way down...  What this paper really showed me is we need not only to change programming practices and constructs, but we also need to design solutions that allow for deep parallelism to begin with. Grafting parallelism on later is difficult. Parallel execution requires knowing precisely how components are dependent on each other and that level of precision tends to go far beyond the human attention span.  In particular this paper deals with how to parallelize the browser on</p><p>5 0.68185514 <a title="485-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-27-Scalable_virus_scanning_for_web-applications.html">328 high scalability-2008-05-27-Scalable virus scanning for web-applications</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,     We're looking for a highly scalable way of scanning documents being uploaded and downloaded from our web application. I believe services like gmail and hotmail are using bespoke solutions from companies like Trend, but are there some quality "off the shelf" products out there that can easily be scaled out and have a "loose" API (HTTP based) for application integration?

<p>Introduction: Over the last several decades computer architects have been phenomenally successful turning the transistor bounty provided by Moore's Law into chips with ever increasing single-threaded performance. During many of these successful years, however, many researchers paid scant attention to multiprocessor work. Now as vendors turn to multicore chips, researchers are reacting with more papers on multi-threaded systems. While this is good, we are concerned that further work on single-thread performance will be squashed.     To help understand future high-level trade-offs, we develop a corollary to Amdahl's Law for multicore chips [Hill & Marty, IEEE Computer 2008]. It models fixed chip resources for alternative designs that use symmetric cores, asymmetric cores, or dynamic techniques that allow cores to work together on sequential execution. Our results encourage multicore designers to view performance of the entire chip rather than focus on core efficiencies. Moreover, we observe that obtai</p><p>2 0.92060339 <a title="485-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-27-Paper%3A_Logic_and_Lattices_for_Distributed_Programming.html">1273 high scalability-2012-06-27-Paper: Logic and Lattices for Distributed Programming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Neil Conway  from Berkeley CS is giving an advanced level talk at  a meetup today  in San Francisco on a new paper:  Logic and Lattices for Distributed Programming  - extending set logic to support CRDT-style lattices. 
 
The description of the meetup is probably the clearest introduction to the paper:
  Developers are increasingly choosing datastores that sacrifice strong consistency guarantees in exchange for improved performance and availability. Unfortunately, writing reliable distributed programs without the benefit of strong consistency can be very challenging.

 


In this talk, I'll discuss work from our group at UC Berkeley that aims to make it easier to write distributed programs without relying on strong consistency. Bloom is a declarative programming language for distributed computing, while CALM is an analysis technique that identifies programs that are guaranteed to be eventually consistent. I'll then discuss our recent work on extending CALM to support a broader range of</p><p>3 0.90914077 <a title="485-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-13-Friendster_Lost_Lead_Because_of_a_Failure_to_Scale.html">153 high scalability-2007-11-13-Friendster Lost Lead Because of a Failure to Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hey, this scaling stuff might just be important.  Jim Scheinman,  former Bebo and Friendster exec, puts the blame squarely on Friendster's inability to scale as why they lost the social networking race:   VB  : Can you tell me a bit about what you learned in your time at Friendster? 
 
     JS  :  For me, it basically came down to failed execution on the technology side — we had millions of Friendster members begging us to get the site working faster so they could log in and spend hours social networking with their friends. I remember coming in to the office for months reading thousands of customer service emails telling us that if we didn’t get our site working better soon, they’d be ‘forced to join’ a new social networking site that had just launched called MySpace…the rest is history. To be fair to Friendster’s technology team at the time, they were on the forefront of many new scaling and database issues that web sites simply hadn’t had to deal with prior to Friendster.

<p>Introduction: It seems that HTTP calls have become a default way to think about distributed systems. HTTP and Web services definitely have a lot to offer, but they are not the only way to do things and there are definitely cases where web is not the right choice.  Unfortunately, lots of people just stick with web services and hack on, trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. In cases such as these, a different distribution paradigm can save us quite a lot of time and effort both in development and later in maintenance. One of those different paradigms is messaging.</p><p>5 0.8994261 <a title="485-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-26-Architecture_to_Allow_High_Availability_File_Upload.html">262 high scalability-2008-02-26-Architecture to Allow High Availability File Upload</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,     I was wondering if anyone has found any information on how to architect a system to support high availability file uploads. My scenario: I have an Apache server proxying requests to a bunch of Tomcat Java application servers. When I need to upgrade my site, I stop and upgrade each of the Tomcat servers one at a time. This seems to work well as Apache automatically routes subsequent requests for the stopped app server to the remaining app servers that are up. The problem is that if a user is uploading a file when the app server is stopped, the upload fails and the user has to upload the file again. This is problematic as uploading files is an integral feature of the site and it's frustrating for the users to have to restart  their uploads every time I upgrade the site (which I want to be able to do frequently).     Has anyone seen any information on how this can be done or have ideas on how this can be architected? I imagine sites like Flickr must have a solution to this problem</p><p>6 0.85829866 <a title="485-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-09-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_September_9%2C_2011.html">1113 high scalability-2011-09-09-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For September 9, 2011</a></p>

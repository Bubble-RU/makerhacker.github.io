<p>Introduction: Hello, I am new to the back end side of things. Love this web site.Read all
comments about Amazon hosting, actually I really like Amazon S3 but concerned
that it may not be sufficient for my computing needs. And E3 just not too
sure.What about hosting sites like host monster? Their prices seem amazing.
Are they too good to be true? What are the cons and what are the things I
should be considering? I am concerned about costs, but I want user experience
to be world class.I am creating a media sharing site.Any help will be
great.ThanksFahad</p><p>5 0.10422012 <a title="632-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-01-Web_Speed_Can_Push_You_Off_of_Google_Search_Rankings%21_What_Can_You_Do%3F.html">834 high scalability-2010-06-01-Web Speed Can Push You Off of Google Search Rankings! What Can You Do?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Google made a right move by adding web-speed to the search engine ranking.
With this change site latency does't just impact the user experience but it
will determine where you will be placed in google search results.This move
could be a real game changer as it bring site latency and scalability to the
front stage. Sites will not only compete on content but on thier performance.
It is now clear that site performance have much more direct impact on our
business (as appose to indirect impact resulted in user expereince) then ever
before.In this post i try to provide some architecture guide line on how to
control and improve site latency under scale based on a discussion with a
leading eCommerce site the Netherland.See detailed story  here</p><p>6 0.10413797 <a title="632-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-27-Some_Questions_from_a_newbie.html">584 high scalability-2009-04-27-Some Questions from a newbie</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi, I stumbled on your site and I am thinking about starting a website. I
haven't received a good answer about what I should use to buildit, so I
thought I would give it a shot.I am a windows guy. I know .Net and ASP and how
to build web sites using that stack. But I notice most sites use LAMP and
that's what most people talk about using. What's wrong with using Windows?.Net

<p>Introduction: Find out with Builtwith.com. It scans a site and guesses how the site is
built. I ran it on this site and it said: Apache, Windows, PHP, Adsense, RSS,
CSS, Javascript, and UTF-8 encoding. Correct, yet I think it should have
guessed Drupal was the CMS and it should have been able to determine which
AJAX library is used. Though it's kind of cool to see which sites use PHP and
other technologies.</p><p>4 0.82138395 <a title="632-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-29-When_things_aren%27t_scalable.html">232 high scalability-2008-01-29-When things aren't scalable</a></p>
<p>Introduction: OK,I know this site is for scalable web site design. But as there aren't any
sites I can find for graceful failure under "slashdotted" like pressure I'll
ask here.Does anyone have a sensible way, once you have a "web application"
that either won't scale, or can't scale, that you can give some users a good
consistent experience and bounce other users to a busy site page. I have seen
sites do this to varying degrees, some of which work better than others, but
no explanations beyond simply bouncing requests to a "we're busy page server"
when you have more than a given number of connections. This is obviously
useless as a web page likely requires multiple connection (ignoring keep-
alive, pipelining etc) multiple connection to completely render properly.The
normal problem is users getting a page and not the "furniture" for that page
like images or css. Other problems are having to wait ages to get the busy
page or the site being slow even if you do "get in". And some site let a user
"in" a</p><p>5 0.79154426 <a title="632-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-10-MONO_ASP.NET._Will_it_make_the_web%3F%3F%3F.html">206 high scalability-2008-01-10-MONO ASP.NET. Will it make the web???</a></p>

cannot see any real websites (with the term real I mean "a highly visited
website") running mono. What do you think?Will MONO ASP.NET scale???Is it
worth planning a site to run with Mono asp.net? Or should we leave it to the

<p>Introduction: Hi, if you were to design your own highly scalable website from scratch, what
technologies would you use?Based on Web 2.0 popularity, LAMP seems to be high
in the running. But would you tack on CakePHP? Drupal? or build your
framework/CMS from scratch?What version of Linux runs best for a scalable
website?Would you consider Windows and .NET? Java? Or do you want to throw a
brick at me for even suggesting such heresies?Would you prefer Postgres,
Tomcat, Perl, Python, or any of that other *NIX fancy stuff...why or why
not?Please forget for the moment, "use what you know" argument. I am pretty
versatile, and can look for an expert in whatever platform I choose. So all
skills being equal, I'm looking for the best community support, the fastest
development time and most importantly, the best scaling approach.Let's say,
for fun, that I'm planning for the website to have as many messages going back
& forth as an eBay.Definitely building this on a budget..Jason</p><p>6 0.69927448 <a title="632-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-31-Product%3A_collectd.html">197 high scalability-2007-12-31-Product: collectd</a></p>

<p>Introduction: breakThis JoelOnSoftwarethreadasks the age old question of what and how to
log. The usual trace/error/warning/info advice is totally useless in a large
scale distributed system. Instead, you need tolog everything all the timeso
you can solve problems that have already happened across a potentially huge
range of servers. Yes, it can be done.To see why the typical logging approach
is broken, imagine this scenario: Your site has been up and running great for
weeks. No problems. A foreshadowing beeper goes off at 2AM. It seems some
users can no longer add comments to threads. Then you hear the debugging
deathknell: it's an intermittent problem and customers are pissed. Fix it.
Now.So how are you going to debug this? The monitoring system doesn't show any
obvious problems or errors. You quickly post a comment and it works fine. This
won't be easy. So you think. Commenting involves a bunch of servers and
networks. There's the load balancer, spam filter, web server, database server,

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byGordon Worley, a Software Engineer atKorrelate, where
they correlate (see what they did there) online purchases to offline
purchases.Several weeks ago, we came into the office one morning to find every
server alarm going off. Pixel log processing was behind by 8 hours and not
making headway. Checking the logs, we discovered that a big client had come
online during the night and was giving us 10 times more traffic than we were
originally told to expect. I wouldn't say we panicked, but the office was
certainly more jittery than usual. Over the next several hours, though, thanks
both to foresight and quick thinking, we were able to scale up to handle the
added load and clear the backlog to return log processing to a steady state.At
Korrelate, we deploytracking pixels, also known beacons or web bugs, that our
partners use to send us information about their users. These tiny web objects

<p>Introduction: How do you query hundreds of gigabytes of new data each day streaming in from
over 600 hyperactive servers? If you think this sounds like the perfect battle
ground for a head-to-head skirmish in the greatMapReduce Versus Database War,
you would be correct.Bill Boebel, CTO of Mailtrust (Rackspace's mail
division), has generously provided a fascinating account of how they evolved
their log processing system from an early amoeba'ic text file stored on each
machine approach, to a Neandertholic relational database solution that just
couldn't compete, and finally to a Homo sapien'ic Hadoop based solution that
works wisely for them and has virtually unlimited scalability
potential.Rackspace faced a now familiar problem. Lots and lots of data
streaming in. Where do you store all that data? How do you do anything useful
with it? In the first version of their system logs were stored in flat text
files and had to be manually searched by engineers logging into each
individual machine. Then came a</p><p>6 0.13721012 <a title="541-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-28-Product%3A_Web_Log_Storming.html">37 high scalability-2007-07-28-Product: Web Log Storming</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Partitioning is what differentiates scaling-out from scaling-up, isn't it? I
thought so too until I readPat Helland's blog post on Hyder, a research
database at Microsoft, in whichthe database is the log, no partitioning is
required, and the database is multi-versioned. Not much is available on Hyder.
There's the excellent summary post from Mr. Helland and these documents:
Scaling Out without Partitioning andScaling Out without Partitioning  \- Hyder
Update by Phil Bernstein and Colin Reid of Microsoft.The idea behind Hyder as
summarized by Pat Helland (see his blog for the full post):Hyder is a software
stack for transactional record management. It can offer full database
functionality and is designed to take advantage of flash in a novel way. Most
approaches to scale-out use partitioning and spread the data across multiple
machines leaving the application responsible for consistency. In Hyder, the
database is the log, no partitioning is required, and the database is multi-
versioned.</p><p>6 0.76887351 <a title="541-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-28-Product%3A_Web_Log_Storming.html">37 high scalability-2007-07-28-Product: Web Log Storming</a></p>

<p>Introduction: GemFire Enterprise is in-memory distributed data management platform that
pools memory (and CPU, network and optionally local disk) across multiple
processes to manage application objects and behavior. With the 6.0 release,
GemFire has reached a stage of maturity in its evolution. GemStone touts this
version as the true 'best of breed' distributed caching technology, solving
scalability issues in all industries.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.85266674 <a title="541-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Product%3A_Smart_Inspect.html">541 high scalability-2009-03-16-Product: Smart Inspect</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Smart Inspecthas added quite a few features specifically tailored to
highscalability and high performance environments to our tool over the
years.This includes the ability to log to memory and dump log files on
demand(when a crash occurs for example), special backlog queue features, a
logservice application for central log storage and a lot more.
Additionally,our SmartInspect Console (the viewer application) makes viewing,
filteringand inspecting large amounts of logging data a lot easier/practical.</p><p>4 0.77882826 <a title="541-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-30-Is_%22Scaling_Engineer%22_a_new_job_title%3F.html">335 high scalability-2008-05-30-Is "Scaling Engineer" a new job title?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Justin.tv is looking to hire aScaling Engineerto help scale their video
cluster, IRC server, web app, monitoring and search services. I've never seen
this job title before. A quick search that showed only a few previous
instances of it being used. Has anyone else seen Scaling Engineer as a job
title before?It's a great idea. Scaling is certainly a worthy specialty of
it's own. Why there's a difficult lingo, obscure tools, endlessly subtle
concepts, a massive body of knowledge to master, and many competing religious
factions. All a good start. Next I see a chain of Scalability Universities.
Maybe use all those Starbucks that are closing down. Contact me for franchise
opportunities :-)</p><p>5 0.76586401 <a title="541-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-08-ID_generator.html">145 high scalability-2007-11-08-ID generator</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,I would like feed back on a ID generator I just made. What positive and
negative effects do you see with this. It's programmed in Java, but could just
as easily be programmed in any other typical language. It's thread safe and
does not use any synchronization. When testing it on my laptop, I was able to
generate 10 million IDs within about 15 seconds, so it should be more than
fast enough.Take a look at the attachment.. (had to rename it from IdGen.java
to IdGen.txt to attach it)IdGen.java</p><p>6 0.70417029 <a title="541-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-03-5_Rockin%27_Tips_for_Scaling_PHP_to_30%2C000_Concurrent_Users_Per_Server.html">1486 high scalability-2013-07-03-5 Rockin' Tips for Scaling PHP to 30,000 Concurrent Users Per Server</a></p>

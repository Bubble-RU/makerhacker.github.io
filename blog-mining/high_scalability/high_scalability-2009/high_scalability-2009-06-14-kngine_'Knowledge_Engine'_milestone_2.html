<p>Introduction: This article not about Mariah Carey, or its song. It's about Storing System,
Database.First let's describe what means by odds: In my social network, I
found 93% of the mainstream developers sanctify the database, or at least
consider it in any data persistence challenge as the ultimate, superhero, and
undefeatable solution.I think this problem come from the education,
personally, and some companies also I think it's involved in this.To start to
fix this bad thinking, we all should agree in the following points:Every
challenge have its own solutions, so whatever you want to save/persistent,
there are always many solutions. For example the Web search engines, such as:
Google, Kngine, Yahoo, Bing don't use database at all instead we use Indexes
(Index file) for better performance.The Database in general whatever the
vendor it's slow compared with other solutions such as: Key-Value storing
system, Index file, DHT.The Database currently employ Relation Data model, or
Object relational data</p><p>4 0.14894962 <a title="630-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-28-Job_queue_and_search_engine.html">332 high scalability-2008-05-28-Job queue and search engine</a></p>

like to execute search jobs asynchronously (with a job queuing system).But i
don't know if it is a good design... Why ?Search results can be large ! (eg:
100+ pages with 25 documents per page)With asynchronous sytem, I need to store
results for each search job.I can set a short expiration time (~5 min) for
each search result, but it's still large.What do you think about it ?Which
design would you use for that ?ThanksMat</p><p>5 0.097076245 <a title="630-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-08-Audiogalaxy.com_Architecture.html">269 high scalability-2008-03-08-Audiogalaxy.com Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 3:Always Refer to Your V1 As a Prototype. You really do have to plan to
throw one away.Update 2:Lessons Learned Scaling the Audiogalaxy Search Engine.
Things he should have done and fun things he couldn’t justify
doing.Update:Design details of Audiogalaxy.com’s high performance MySQL search
engine. At peak times, the search engine needed to handle 1500-2000 searches
every second against a MySQL database with about 200 million rows.Search was
one of most interesting problems at Audiogalaxy. It was one of the core
functions of the site, and somewhere between 50 to 70 million searches were
performed every day. At peak times, the search engine needed to handle
1500-2000 searches every second against a MySQL database with about 200
million rows.</p><p>6 0.095012389 <a title="630-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-28-DuckDuckGo_Architecture_-_1_Million_Deep_Searches_a_Day_and_Growing.html">1395 high scalability-2013-01-28-DuckDuckGo Architecture - 1 Million Deep Searches a Day and Growing</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I have a table .This table has many columns but search performed based on 1
columns ,this table can have more than million rows.The data in these columns
is something like funny,new york,hollywoodUser can search with parameters as
funny hollywood .I need to take this 2 words and then search on column whether
that column contain this words and how many times .It is not possible to index
here .If the results return say 1200 results then without comparing each and
every column i can't determine no of results.I need to compare for each and
every column.This query is very frequent .How can i approach for this
problem.What type of architecture,tools is helpful.I just know that this can
be accomplished with distributed system but how can i make this system. I also
see in this website that LinkedIn uses Lucene for search .Is Lucene is helpful
in my case.My table has also lots of insertion ,however updation in not very
frequent.</p><p>5 0.81478143 <a title="630-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-12-Search_the_tags_across_all_post.html">246 high scalability-2008-02-12-Search the tags across all post</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Kngine is Knowledge Web search engine designed to provide meaningful search
results, such as: semantic information about the keywords/concepts, answer the
user's questions, discover the relations between the keywords/concepts, and
link the different kind of data together, such as: Movies, Subtitles, Photos,
Price at sale store, User reviews, and Influenced storyGoalsKngine long-term
goal is to make all human beings systematic knowledge and experience
accessible to everyone. I aim to collect and organize all objective data, and
make it possible and easy to access. Our goal is to build on the advances of
Web search engine, semantic web, data representation technologies a new form
of Web search engine that will unleash a revolution of new
possibilities.Kngine tries to combine the power of Web search engines with the
power of Semantic search and the data representation to provide meaningful
search results compromising user needs.StatusKngine starts as a research
project in October 2008.

<p>Introduction: (Please bare with me, I'm a new, passionate, confident and terrified
programmer :D )Background:I'm pre-launch and 1 year into the development of my
application. My target is to be able to eventually handle millions of
registered users with 5-10% of them concurrent. Up to this point I've used
auto-increment to assign unique identifiers to rows. I am now considering
switching to a non-sequential strategy. Oh, I'm using the LAMP
configuration.My reasons for avoiding auto-increment:1. Complicates
replication when scaling horizontally. Risk of collision is significant (when
running multiple masters). Note: I've read the other entries in this forum
that relate to ID generation and there have been some great suggestions --
including a strategy that uses auto-increment in a way that avoids this
pitfall... That said, I'm still nervous about it.2. Potential bottleneck when
retrieving/assigning IDs -- IDs assigned at the database.My reasons for being
nervous about non-sequential IDs:1.

<p>Introduction: In update toPrismatic Architecture - Using Machine Learning on Social Networks
to Figure Out What You Should Read on the Web, Jason Wolfe, even in the face
of deadening fatigue from long nights spent getting their iPhone app out, has
gallantly agreed to talk a little more about Primatic's approach to Machine
Learning.Documents and users are two areas where Prismatic applies ML (machine
learning):ML on DocumentsGiven an HTML document: learn how to extract the main
text of the page (rather than the sidebar, footer, comments, etc), its title,
author, best images, etcdetermine features for relevance (e.g., what the
article is about, topics, etc.)The setup for most of these tasks is pretty
typical. Models are trained using big batch jobs on other machines that read
data from s3, save the learned parameter files to s3, and then read (and
periodically refresh) the models from s3 in the ingest pipeline.All of the
data that flows out of the system can be fed back into this pipeline, which

take you in small trip in Snippet Search research project at Kngine. What is
Kngine?Kngine is startup company working in Searching technologies, We in

Representation technologies a new form of Web Search Engine that will unleash
a revolution of new possibilities. Introduction to Snippet SearchToday, The
Web Search Engine's is the Web getaway, especially to get specific
information. But unfortunately the search engines didn't changed mush as the
Web changed from 90's.Since the 90's the Web search engine still provide the
same kind of results: Links to documents. We in Kngine think that it's the

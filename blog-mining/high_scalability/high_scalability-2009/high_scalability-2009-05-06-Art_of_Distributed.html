<p>Introduction: You want to have a scalable website. You want a website which can handle
traffic spikes (think if you are getting on Digg, Slahsdot, Reddit, Techcrunch
or other very popular websites frontpage).Regular hosting companies
(especially shared hosting) can offer only so much. The servers usually get
crushed under the load in short time.But there is hope. A new breed of hosting
companies emerged recently. A new breed which can offer you the scalability
you need at a fraction of the cost.Welcome to the world of “cloud computing!”
(or “grid computing” or “utility computing”, which are terms for the same
thing).Here's a website which compiled a list of cloud computing hosting
companies (with short descriptions, prices and customer lists for each of
them).Read the entire article aboutCloud computing, grid computing, utility

Peter Laird inUnderstanding the Cloud Computing/SaaS/PaaS markets: a Map of
the Players in the Industrypaints a very cool visual map of all the cloud
service players. It's a larger industry than you might think.Once upon a time
I worked at an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switch startup. Over a
delicious Christmas punch my grandma asked me what I did for a living that I
could afford such extravagantly inexpensive gifts. Always so subtle. I
explained I worked on an ATM switch. Mistake. She sniffed, said that's nice,
and asked me why the Automated Teller Machine ate her bank card that morning.
No matter how hard I tried I couldn't convince her I didn't work on bank ATMs.

<p>Introduction: Hi...I have this idea to start a really great and scalable website, and I am
building it! So far I'm doing everything myself - coding, networking,
architecture planning, everything. I haven't even gotten into the legal
aspects yet.......It would be MUCH easier if I had a technical person to
handle that end of the operation. I'm a good coder, but like Bill Gates at
Harvard for Math, I'm not the very best. I'd like to FIND that very best
person available, to handle the technical aspects. For worse or better, I
don't presently know somebody who fits this bill.I've posted a bazillion ads
on Craig's List, with no really qualified responses. I've put out feelers
among my own network, same result. Not sure what else I can do. Shoestring
budget, so it's sweat equity in the beginning. That can actually be a plus, as
it forces people to focus.Any ideas about what else I can do, to attract the
right person?ThanksJason</p><p>2 0.94849372 <a title="590-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-17-Database_People_Hating_on_MapReduce.html">216 high scalability-2008-01-17-Database People Hating on MapReduce</a></p>

DatabaseExperts Jump The MapReduce Shark. The culture clash is still what
fascinates me.David DeWitt writes in the Database Column that MapReduce is a
major step backwards:A giant step backward in the programming paradigm for
large-scale data intensive applicationsA sub-optimal implementation, in that
it uses brute force instead of indexingNot novel at all -- it represents a
specific implementation of well known techniques developed nearly 25 years
agoMissing most of the features that are routinely included in current

onListening to databasers and map reducers talk is like eavesdropping on your
average family holiday mashup. Every holiday people who have virtually nothing
in common are thrown together because they incidentally share a little DNA or

<p>Introduction: Update 3: Presentation from theNoSQL conference:slides,video 1,video 2.Update
2: The folks at Hypertable would like you to know that Hypertable is now
officiallysponsored by Baidu, China's Leading Search Engine.As a sponsor of
Hypertable, Baidu has committed an industrious team of engineers, numerous
servers, and support resources to improve the quality and development of the
open source technology.Update: InfoQ interview onHypertable Lead Discusses
Hadoop and Distributed Databases. Hypertable differs from HBase in that it is
a higher performance implementation of Bigtable.Skrentabloggives the heads up
onHypertable,Zvents'open-source BigTable clone. It's written in C++ and can
run on top of either HDFS or KFS. Performance looks encouraging at28M rows of

<p>Introduction: Google - A Study In Scalability And A Little Systems Horse Sense. A nice
summary by Krishna Sankar of a version of Jeff Dean's classic talk onGoogle
Scalability given to Stanford's EE380 class.Quotable Quotes:@jkalucki: Getting
just 100 servers to work together for the first time is so ridiculously
complicated. Horizontal scaling doesn't scale.@simeons: Yahoo's scalability is

Yahoo's CTOThe Economics of the Cloud: Dissecting a Must-Read White Paperby
Bernard Golden. I love the depiction of the unseen and unfelt forces that
nevertheless organize everything around them: After a brief introduction, the
authors lay out a central thesis: despite initial concerns about shortcomings
in new technology offerings, "historically, underlying economics have a much
stronger impact on the direction and speed of disruptions, as technological
challenges are resolved or overcome through the rapid innovation we've grown

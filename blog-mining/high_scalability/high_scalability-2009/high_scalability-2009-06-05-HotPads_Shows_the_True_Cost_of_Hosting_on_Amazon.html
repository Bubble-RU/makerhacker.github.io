Our business and team continues to grow, we are now an independent public company, and we have continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown - we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:
  
 56M visitors per month 
 350M+ pages requests a day

<p>Introduction: In a recent thread on Hacker News discussing  recent AWS price changes ,  seldo  mentioned they use AWS for business, they just never use EBS on AWS. A good question was asked:
  

How do you even do anything without using EBS?

  
Amazon certainly makes using EBS the easiest path. And EBS has a better reliability record as of late, but it's still often recommended to not use EBS. This avoids a single point of failure at the cost of a lot of complexity, though as AWS uses EBS internally, not using EBS may not save you if you use other AWS services like RDS or ELB.
 
If you don't want to use EBS, it's hard to know where to even start. A dilemma to which Kevin Nuckolls  gives a great answer :
  

Well, you break your services out onto stateless and stateful machines. After that, you make sure that each of your stateful services is resilient to individual node failure. I prefer to believe that if you can't roll your entire infrastructure over to new nodes monthly then you're unprepared fo</p><p>5 0.15415813 <a title="619-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-16-Scaling_an_AWS_infrastructure_-_Tools_and_Patterns.html">881 high scalability-2010-08-16-Scaling an AWS infrastructure - Tools and Patterns</a></p>

How do you scale an  AWS  (Amazon Web Services) infrastructure? This article will give you a detailed reply in two parts: the tools you can use to make the most of Amazon’s dynamic approach, and the architectural model you should adopt for a scalable infrastructure.
 
I base my report on my experience gained in several AWS production projects in casual gaming (Facebook), e-commerce infrastructures and within the mainstream GIS (Geographic Information System). It’s true that my experience in gaming ( IsCool, The Game ) is currently the most representative in terms of scalability, due to the number of users (over 800 thousand DAU – daily active users – at peak usage and over 20 million page views every day), however my experiences in e-commerce and GIS (currently underway) provide a different view of scalability, taking into account the various problems of availability and da</p><p>6 0.14084226 <a title="619-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-26-End-To-End_Performance_Study_of_Cloud_Services.html">831 high scalability-2010-05-26-End-To-End Performance Study of Cloud Services</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a part interview part guest with Sebastian Stadil, founder of  Scalr , a cheaper open-source version of RightScale. Scalr takes care of all the web site infrastructure bits to on Amazon (and other clouds) so you don’t have to.
 
I first met Sebastian at one of the original Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Group meetups, a group which he founded. The meetings started in the tiny offices of Intalio where Sebastian was working with this new fangled Amazon thing to create an auto-scaling server farm on EC2. I remember distinctly how Sebastian met everyone at the door with a handshake and a smile, making us all feel welcome. Later I took one of the classes he  created on how to use AWS. I guess he figured all this cloud stuff was going somewhere and decided to start Scalr.
 
My only regret about this post is that the name Amazon does not begin with the letter ‘S’, that would have made for an epic title.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Marcel Panse  and  Sander Nagtegaal  from  Peecho . 
 
Although architecture descriptions are an interesting read, the problems that start-ups face are hardly ever addressed. We would like to change that, so here is our architecture story.
  Introducing a start-up  
 
 
The Amsterdam-based company  Peecho  offers print-as-a-service. Our embeddable  print button  allows you to sell your digital content as professionally printed products, like photo books, magazines or canvases - straight from your own website. There is an API, too.
 
Printcloud is the system that powers the print button. It exists in the cloud only, growing when needed and becoming smaller if it can. The system takes in print orders, magically transforms tough data into print-ready files and routes the orders to the production facility that is closest to the intended recipient.
 
To preserve the environment, Peecho's philosophy is to facilitate global ordering, but to aim for local production on</p><p>6 0.73618627 <a title="619-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-23-Salesforce_Architecture_-_How_they_Handle_1.3_Billion_Transactions_a_Day.html">1521 high scalability-2013-09-23-Salesforce Architecture - How they Handle 1.3 Billion Transactions a Day</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Mather Corgan, president of HotPads,  gave a great talk  on how HotPads uses AWS to run their real estate search engine. I loved the presentation for a few reasons:
  It gives real costs on on their servers, how many servers they have, what they are used for, and exactly how they use S2, EBS, CloudFront and other AWS services. This is great information for anybody trying to architect a system and wondering where to run it.    HotPads is a "real" application. It's a small company and at 4.5 million page-views/month it's large but not super large. It has custom server side components like indexing engines, image processing, and background database update engines for syncing new real estate data. And it also stores a lot of images and has low latency requirements.   This a really good example mix of where many companies are or would like to be with their applications.   Their total costs are about $11K/month, which is about what they were paying at their previous provider.

<p>Introduction: Toy solutions solving Twitter’s “problems” are a favorite scalability trope. Everybody has this idea that Twitter is easy. With a little architectural hand waving we have a scalable Twitter, just that simple. Well, it’s not that simple as   Raffi Krikorian   , VP of Engineering at Twitter, describes in his superb and very detailed presentation on    Timelines at Scale   . If you want to know how Twitter works - then start here.  
 
It happened gradually so you may have missed it, but Twitter has grown up. It started as a struggling   three-tierish Ruby on Rails    website to become a beautifully service driven core that we actually go to now to see if other services are down. Quite a change.  
 
Twitter now has 150M world wide active users, handles 300K QPS to generate timelines, and a firehose that churns out 22 MB/sec. 400 million tweets a day flow through the system and it can take up to 5 minutes for a tweet to flow from Lady Gaga’s fingers to her 31 million followers.

<p>Introduction: With Amazon     announcing new High I/O 2TB SSD instances    the age of SSD has almost arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on demand rate the   price per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:   27 cents ($27K/100K IOPS) per vs    $1.25 for disk   .     With the obvious benefits of giant SSD machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it’s interesting to consider: what architecture decisions might you make differently in the future? 
   More Headroom for Vertical Scaling Simplifies Everything   
 The beauty of higher hardware performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This has always been the allure of    vertical scaling    and is well realized by SSDs through a combination of high throughput, low latencies, and just as important, high densities.

 Achievements:                 
 
  Watson  uses 10,000's of watts, the computer between the ears uses 20. With only 200 million pages and 2TB of data, Watson is BigInsights, not BigData. 
 That Google is pretty big:  1 billion unique monthly visitors  
  tweetimages : We peaked at 22m avatars yesterday. Bandwidth peaked at 9GB of @twitter avatars in a single hour. 
  Foursquare Surpasses 10 Million Users   
  Reddit Hits 1.2B Monthly Pageviews, More Than Doubles Its Engineering Staff  
  Twitter : 185 million tweets are posted daily;  1.6 billion search queries daily; indexing latency is less than 10 seconds.  
 
 
 Quotable quotes:

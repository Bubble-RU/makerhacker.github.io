<p>Introduction: When building a system on top of a set of wildly uncooperative and unruly
computers you have knowledge problems: knowing when other nodes are dead;
knowing when nodes become alive; getting information about other nodes so you
can make local decisions, like knowing which node should handle a request
based on a scheme for assigning nodes to a certain range of users; learning
about new configuration data; agreeing on data values; and so on.How do you
solve these problems? A common centralized approach is to use a database and
all nodes query it for information. Obvious availability and performance
issues for large distributed clusters. Another approach is to use Paxos, a
protocol for solving consensus in a network to maintain strict consistency
requirements for small groups of unreliable processes. Not practical when
larger number of nodes are involved.So what's the super cool decentralized way
to bring order to large clusters?Gossip protocols, which maintain relaxed
consistency requireme</p><p>4 0.12390625 <a title="705-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-01-Paper%3A_The_Case_for_Determinism_in_Database_Systems__.html">890 high scalability-2010-09-01-Paper: The Case for Determinism in Database Systems  </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 2:Sorting 1 PB with MapReduce. PB is not peanut-butter-and-jelly
misspelled. It's 1 petabyte or 1000 terabytes or 1,000,000 gigabytes.It took
six hours and two minutes to sort 1PB (10 trillion 100-byte records) on 4,000
computersand the results were replicated thrice on 48,000 disks.Update:Greg
Lindenpoints to a new Google articleMapReduce: simplified data processing on
large clusters. Some interesting stats: 100k MapReduce jobs are executed each
day; more than 20 petabytes of data are processed per day; more than 10k
MapReduce programs have been implemented; machines are dual processor with
gigabit ethernet and 4-8 GB of memory.Google is the King of scalability.
Everyone knows Google for their large, sophisticated, and fast searching, but
they don't just shine in search. Their platform approach to building scalable

<p>Introduction: Distributed transactions are costly because they useagreement protocols.
Calvin says, surprisingly, that using a deterministic database allows you to
avoid the use of agreement protocols. The approach is to use a deterministic
transaction layer that does all the hard work before acquiring locks and the
beginning of transaction execution.Overview:Many distributed storage systems
achieve high data access throughput via partitioning and replication, each
system with its own advantages and tradeoffs. In order to achieve high
scalability, however, today's systems generally reduce transactional support,
disallowing single transactions from spanning multiple partitions. Calvin is a
practical transaction scheduling and data replication layer that uses a
deterministic ordering guarantee to signiďŹ cantly reduce the normally
prohibitive contention costs associated with distributed transactions. Unlike

<p>Introduction: If you stayed up all night watching the life reaffirmingCuriosity landing on
Mars, then this paper,High-Performance Concurrency Control Mechanisms for
Main-Memory Databases, has nothing to do with that at all, but it is an
excellent look at how to use optimistic MVCC schemes to reduce lock overhead
on in-memory datastructures:A database system optimized for in-memory storage
can support much higher transaction rates than current systems. However,
standard concurrency control methods used today do not scale to the high
transaction rates achievable by such systems. In this paper we introduce two
efficient concurrency control methods specifically designed for main-memory
databases. Both use multiversioning to isolate read-only transactions from
updates but differ in how atomicity is ensured: one is optimistic and one is
pessimistic. To avoid expensive context switching, transactions never block
during normal processing but they may have to wait before commit to ensure

<p>Introduction: We are not yet at the End of History for database theory asPeter Bailisand
theDatabase Groupat UC Berkeley continue to prove with a greatcompanion blog
post to their new paper: Scalable Atomic Visibility with RAMP Transactions. I
like the approach of pairing a blog post with a paper. A paper almost by
definition is formal, but a blog post can help put a paper in context and give
it some heart.From the abstract:Databases can provide scalability by
partitioning data across several servers. However, multi-partition, multi-
operation transactional access is often expensive, employing coordination-
intensive locking, validation, or scheduling mechanisms. Accordingly, many
real-world systems avoid mechanisms that provide useful semantics formulti-
partition operations. This leads to incorrect behavior for a large class of
applications including secondary indexing,foreign key enforcement, and
materialized view maintenance. In this work, we identify a new isolation model

<p>Introduction: We've seen a lot ofNoSQLaction lately built around distributed hash tables.
Btrees are getting jealous. Btrees, once the king of the database world, want
their throne back.Paul Buchheitsurfaced a paper:A practical scalable
distributed B-treeby Marcos K. Aguilera and Wojciech Golab, that might help
spark a revolution.From the Abstract:We propose a new algorithm for a
practical, fault tolerant, and scalable B-tree distributed over a set of
servers. Our algorithm supports practical features not present in prior work:
transactions that allow atomic execution of multiple operations over multiple
B-trees, online migration of B-tree nodes between servers, and dynamic
addition and removal of servers. Moreover, our algorithm is conceptually
simple: we use transactions to manipulate B-tree nodes so that clients need
not use complicated concurrency and locking protocols used in prior work. To
execute these transactions quickly, we rely on three techniques: (1) We use
optimistic concurrency contro</p><p>2 0.91052902 <a title="705-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-12-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_12%2C_2011.html">1097 high scalability-2011-08-12-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 12, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is guest post byMichael DeHaan(@laserllama), a software developer and
architect, on Ansible, a simple deployment, model-driven configuration
management, and command execution framework.I owe High Scalability a great
deal of credit for the idea behind my latest software project. I was reading
about how an older tool I helped create, Func, was used atTumblr, and it
kicked some ideas into gear. This article is about what happened from that
idea.My observation, which the article reinforced, was that many shops end up
using a configuration management tool (Puppet, Chef, cfengine), a separate
deployment tool (Capistrano, Fabric) and yet another separate ad-hoc task
execution tool (Func, pssh, etc) because one class of tool historically hasn't
been good at all three jobs.My other observation (not from the article) was
that the whole "infrastructure as code" movement, while revolutionary, and
definitely great for many, was probably secretly grating on a good number of
systems administrato</p><p>5 0.90056378 <a title="705-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-11-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_November_11%2C_2011.html">1141 high scalability-2011-11-11-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For November 11, 2011</a></p>

is that it has a LOT to do with simplicity and consistency.Ray Walters: Quad-

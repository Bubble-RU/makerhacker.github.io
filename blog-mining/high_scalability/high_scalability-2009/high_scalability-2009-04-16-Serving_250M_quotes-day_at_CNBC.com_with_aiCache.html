<p>Introduction: CNBC, like many large web sites, relied  on a CDN for content delivery.
Recently, we started looking  to see if we could improve this model.  Our
criteria was:- improve response time- have better control over traffic (real
time reporting, change management and alerting)- better utilize internal
datacenters and their infrastructure- shield users from any troubles at the
origin infrastructure- cost outAfter researching the market, we turned to two
vendors: Dyn (Dynamic Network Services) andaiScaler. We' have had   about a
year worth of experience withaiScaler (search for "CNBC" to see my previous
post ), but Dyn was a new vendor for us.  We started building our relationship
at Velocity conference in the summer of 2009.Dyn has recently started offering
a geo-aware DNS load balancing solution, using Anycast and the distributed
nature of their DNS presence to enable a key component of what we were trying
to achieve: steer users to geographically closest origin point. The traffic

Nope..It's Lights Out.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Advertising for the Super Bowl is bigger than the game for many viewers. So
you gotta figure advertisers are ready for the traffic bursts generated by
their expensive ads? Not exactly...Yottaareports an amazing 13 advertiser
websites crashedduring the Super Bowl. Coke was interactively au currant,
asking viewers to vote for the ending of a commercial, but load times went to
62 seconds. SodaStream, Calvin Klein, Axe, Got Milk? The Walking Dead, many
movie sites, and many car sites, all were flagged with delay of fame
penalties.Lots of time, money, and creative energy is spent lovingly
perfecting every detail of these commercials. It won't be a surprise to any
programmer that this can't usually be said of the follow through on the
backend.So what can you do? Yottaa has some good tips and Michael Hamrah has a
wonderful post on dealing with the Super Bowl Burst Problem:Yottaa's
tips:Reduce the number of assets and asset weight to create smaller, more

<p>Introduction: CNBC, like many large web sites, relied  on a CDN for content delivery.
Recently, we started looking  to see if we could improve this model.  Our
criteria was:- improve response time- have better control over traffic (real
time reporting, change management and alerting)- better utilize internal
datacenters and their infrastructure- shield users from any troubles at the
origin infrastructure- cost outAfter researching the market, we turned to two
vendors: Dyn (Dynamic Network Services) andaiScaler. We' have had   about a
year worth of experience withaiScaler (search for "CNBC" to see my previous
post ), but Dyn was a new vendor for us.  We started building our relationship
at Velocity conference in the summer of 2009.Dyn has recently started offering
a geo-aware DNS load balancing solution, using Anycast and the distributed
nature of their DNS presence to enable a key component of what we were trying
to achieve: steer users to geographically closest origin point. The traffic
balancing r</p><p>5 0.79716372 <a title="573-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-08-Mollom_Architecture_-_Killing_Over_373_Million_Spams_at_100_Requests_Per_Second.html">985 high scalability-2011-02-08-Mollom Architecture - Killing Over 373 Million Spams at 100 Requests Per Second</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mollomis one of those cool SaaS companies every developer dreams of creating
when they wrack their brains looking for a viable software-as-a-service
startup. Mollom profitably runs a useful service--spam filtering--with a small
group of geographically distributed developers. Mollom helps protect nearly
40,000 websites from spam, includingone of mine, which is where I first
learned about Mollom. In a desperate attempt to stop spam on a Drupal site,
where every other form of CAPTCHA had failed miserably, I installed Mollom in
about 10 minutes and it immediately started working. That's the out of the box
experience I was looking for.From the time Mollom opened its digital
inspection system they've rejected over 373 million spams and in the process
they've learned that a stunning 90% of all messages are spam. This spam
torrent is handled by only two geographically distributed machines that handle
100 requests/ second, each running a Java application server and Cassandra. So

<p>Introduction: Although the problem of scaling human genome sequencing is not exactly about
building bigger, faster and more reliable websites it is most interesting in
terms of scalability. Thepaperdescribes a new technology by the startup
company Complete Genomics to sequence the full human genome for the fraction
of the cost of earlier possibilities.Complete Genomics is building the world's
largest commercial human genome sequencing center to provide turnkey,
outsourced complete human genome sequencing to customers worldwide.By 2010,
their data center will contain approximately 60,000 processors with 30

<p>Introduction: InNoSQL: Past, Present, FutureEric Brewerhas a particularly fine section on
explaining the often hard to understand ideas ofBASE(Basically Available, Soft
State, Eventually Consistent),ACID(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation,
Durability),CAP(Consistency Availability, Partition Tolerance), in terms of a
pernicious long standing myth about the sanctity of consistency in
banking.Myth: Money is important, so banksmustuse transactions to keep money
safe and consistent, right?Reality: Banking transactions are inconsistent,
particularly for ATMs. ATMs are designed to have a normal case behaviour and a
partition mode behaviour. In partition mode Availability is chosen over
Consistency.Why?1)Availability correlates with revenue and consistency
generally does not.2)Historically there was never an idea of perfect
communication so everything was partitioned.Your ATM transaction must go
through so Availability is more important than consistency. If the ATM is down

<p>Introduction: As traffic to cnbc.com continued to grow, we found ourselves in an all-too-
familiar situation where one feels that a BIG change in how things are done
was in order, the status-quo was a road to nowhere. The spending on HW, amount
of space and power required to host additional servers, less-than-stellar
response times, having to resort to frequent "micro"-caching and similar
tricks to try to improve code performance - all of these were surfacing in
plain sight, hard to ignore.While code base could clearly be improved, the
limited Dev resources and having to innovate to stay competitive always limits
ability to go about refactoring. So how can one go about addressing
performance and other needs without a full blown effort across the entire team
? For us, the answer was aiCache - a Web caching and application acceleration
product (aicache.com).breakThe idea behind caching is simple - handle the

<p>Introduction: This is a guest posting by Marty Abbott and Michael Fisher, authors ofThe Art
of Scalability. I'm still reading their book and will have an interview with
them a little later.  If 2010 is the year that you've decided to kickoff your
startup or if you've already got something off the ground and are expecting
double or triple digit growth, this list is for you.  We all
wanttheattentionof usersto achieve viral growth but as manycan attest, too
much attention can bring a startup to its knees. If you've used Twitter for
any amount of time you're sure to have seen the "Fail Whale", which is so
often seen that it has its ownfan club. Take a look at the graph below from
Compete.com showing Twitter's unique visitors. One can argue that limitations
in the product offering have as much to do with the flattening of growthover
the past six monthsas does the availability,butit's hard to believe the
inability of users to actually use the service has not hindered growth. What

<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's
discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon
organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable
systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the
ACM Queue article have also been included.Amazon grew from a tiny online
bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering
new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden

<p>Introduction: Update 2:Velocity 09: John Allspaw, 10+ Deploys Per Day: Dev and Ops
Cooperation at Flickr. Insightful talk. Some highlights: Change is good if you
can build tools and culture to lower the risk of change. Operations and
developers need to become of one mind and respect each other. An automated
infrastructure is the one tool you need most. Common source control. One step
build. One step deploy. Don't be a pussy, deploy. Always ship trunk. Feature
flags - don't branch code, make features runtime configurable in code. Dark
launch - release data paths early without UI component. Shared metrics.
Adaptive feedback to prioritize important features. IRC for communication for
human context. Best solutions occur when dev and op work together and trust
each other. Trust is earned by helping each other solve their problems. Look
at what new features imply for operations, what can go wrong, and how to
recover. Provide knobs and levers to help operations. Devs should have access
to production machin</p><p>5 0.10894909 <a title="679-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-12-4_Architecture_Issues_When_Scaling_Web_Applications%3A_Bottlenecks%2C_Database%2C_CPU%2C_IO.html">1646 high scalability-2014-05-12-4 Architecture Issues When Scaling Web Applications: Bottlenecks, Database, CPU, IO</a></p>

mean several things. Most developers are primarily concerned with are response
time and scalability. Response TimeIs the time taken by web application to
process request and return response. Applications should respond to requests
(response time) within acceptable duration. If application is taking beyond
the acceptable time, it is said to be non-performing or degraded.

<p>Introduction: With cloud SLAs generally being worth what you don't pay for them, what can
you do to protect yourself? Sean Hull inAirBNB didn't have to fail  has some
solid advice on how to deal with outages:Use Redundancy. Make database and
webserver tiers redundant using multi-az or alternately read-replicas. Have a
browsing only mode. Give users a read-only version of your site. Users may not
even notice failures as they will only see problems when they need to perform
a write operation.Web Applications need Feature Flags. Build in the ability to
turn off and on major parts of your site and flip the switch when problems
arise.Consider Netflix's Simian. By randomly causing outages in your
application you can continually test your failover and redundancy
infrastructure.Use multiple clouds. Use Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Clouds
as a way of surviving outages in any one particular cloud.None of these are
easy and it's worth considering that your application may not need them at
all. Life will alm</p><p>3 0.74020922 <a title="679-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-30-Scalability_Worst_Practices.html">398 high scalability-2008-09-30-Scalability Worst Practices</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Brian Zimmer, architect at travel startup Yapta, highlights some worst
practices jeopardizing the growth and scalability of a system:* The Golden
Hammer. Forcing a particular technology to work in ways it was not intended is
sometimes counter-productive. Using a database to store key-value pairs is one
example. Another example is using threads to program for concurrency.*
Resource Abuse. Manage the availability of shared resources because when they
fail, by definition, their failure is experienced pervasively rather than in
isolation. For example, connection management to the database through a thread
pool.* Big Ball of Mud. Failure to manage dependencies inhibits agility and
scalability.* Everything or Something. In both code and application dependency
management, the worst practice is not understanding the relationships and
formulating a model to facilitate their management. Failure to enforce
diligent control is a contributing scalability inhibiter.* Forgetting to check
the time. To</p><p>4 0.73642862 <a title="679-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-02-The_case_against_ORM_Frameworks_in_High_Scalability_Architectures.html">235 high scalability-2008-02-02-The case against ORM Frameworks in High Scalability Architectures</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Let me begin by saying that I have used and continue to use various ORM
frameworks such as hibernate, ibatis, propel and activerecord in applications
and websites that have a user base ranging from a couple hundred to 500k
users. Especially for projects that have to be up and running in a short
duration of time, ORM frameworks significantly reduce the effort required to
manipulate and persist OOP objects by providing time saving facilities such as
automatically generated model objects, integrated unit testing, secure
variable substitution, etc. Hibernate even supports horizontal data
partitioning via Hibernate Shards.However, the lay of the land is
significantly different in the rarefied space occupied by applications needing
to support millions of users. Profiling an application at this level and
paying particular attention to the operations needed to move data to and from
the database, it becomes evident that a significant portion of the operations
are API related, whereby the ORM fr</p><p>5 0.71379483 <a title="679-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-27-eBay_Architecture.html">331 high scalability-2008-05-27-eBay Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Why is there something rather than nothing? That's the kind of question
theLarge Hadron Colliderin CERN is hopefully poised to answer. And what is the
output of this beautiful 17-mile long,6 billion dollar wabi-sabishproton
smashing machine? Data. Great heaping torrents of Grand Canyon sized data. 15
million gigabytes every year. That's 1000 times the information printed in
books every year. It's so much data 10,000 scientists will use agridof80,000+
computers, in 300 computer centers , in 50 different countries just to help
make sense of it all.How will all this data be collected, transported, stored,
and analyzed? It turns out, using what amounts to sort of Internet of
Particles instead of an Internet of Things.Two good articles have recently
shed some electro-magnetic energy in the human visible spectrum on the IT
aspects of the collider:LHC computing grid pushes petabytes of data, beats

<p>Introduction: AFK Partners has release what they feel are theBest Practices for
Scalability:Asynchronous- Use asynchronous communication when possible. Swim
Lanes- Create fault isolated "swim lanes" of hardware by customer
segmentation.Cache- Make use of cache at multiple layers.Monitoring-
Understand your application's performance from a customer's perspective.
Replication- Replicate databases for recovery as well as to off load reads to
multiple instances.Sharding- Split the application and databases by service
and / or by customer using a modulus. Use Few RDBMS Features- Use the OLTP
database as a persistent storage device as much as possible. Slow Roll- Roll
out new code versions slowly, to a small subset of your servers without
bringing the entire site down.Load & Performance Testing- Test the performance
of the application version before it goes into production. Capacity Planning /
Scalability Summits- Know how much capacity you have on all tiers and services
in your system.

<p>Introduction: You're Doing it Wrong by Poul-Henning Kamp. Don't look so guilty, he's not
talking about you know what, he's talking about writing high-performance
server programs: Not just wrong as in not perfect, but wrong as in wasting
half, or more, of your performance. What good is an O(log2(n)) algorithm if
those operations cause page faults and slow disk operations? For most relevant
datasets an O(n) or even an O(n^2) algorithm, which avoids page faults, will
run circles around it. A Microsoft Windows Azure primer: the basicsby Peter
Bright. Nice article explaining the basics of Azure and how it compares to
Google and Amazon.A call to change the name from NoSQL to Postmodern
Databases. Interesting idea, but the problem is the same one I have for
Postmodern Art, when is it? I always feel like I'm in the post-post modern
period, yet for art it's really in the early 1900s. Let's save future
developers from this existential time crisis.Constructions from Dots and
Linesby Marko A. Rodriguez, Peter N</p><p>5 0.8971532 <a title="679-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-07-RAFT_-_In_Search_of_an_Understandable_Consensus_Algorithm.html">1498 high scalability-2013-08-07-RAFT - In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If like many humans you've found evenPaxos Made Simplea bit difficult to
understand, you might enjoy RAFT as described inIn Search of an Understandable
Consensus Algorithm by Stanford'sDiego Ongaroand John Ousterhout. The video
presentation of the paper is given byJohn Ousterhout. Both the paper and the
video are delightfully accessible.mcherm has a good summary of the paper:A
consensus algorithm is: a cluster of servers should record a series of records
("log entries") in response to requests from clients of the cluster. (It may
also take action based on those entries.) It does so in a way that guarantees
that the responses seen by clients of the cluster will be consistent EVEN in
the face of servers crashing in unpredictable ways (but not loosing data that
was synched to disk), and networks introducing unpredictable delays or
communication blockages.Here's what Raft does. First, it elects a leader, then
the leader records the master version of the log, telling other cluster
servers w</p><p>6 0.88414353 <a title="679-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-08-Servers_Component_-_How_to_choice_and_build_perfect_server.html">653 high scalability-2009-07-08-Servers Component - How to choice and build perfect server</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.   Let's take a short trip down web architecture lane:
  It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl scripts and a SQL database   It's 1995: Scale-up the database.   It's 1998: LAMP   It's 1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SAN   It's 2001: In-memory data-grid.   It's 2003: Add a caching layer.   It's 2004: Add scale-out and partitioning.   It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a distributed file system.   It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.   It's 2008: C</p><p>5 0.073993765 <a title="487-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-12-Oracle_Can_Do_Read-Write_Splitting_Too.html">182 high scalability-2007-12-12-Oracle Can Do Read-Write Splitting Too</a></p>
<p>Introduction: People sometimes wonder why Oracle isn't mentioned on this site more. Maybe it will now as   Michael Nygard reports   Oracle 11g now does read/write splitting with their   Active Data Guard   product. Average replication latency was 1 second and it's accomplished with standard Oracle JDBC drivers. They see a 250% increase in transactions per service for read-write service. And a 110% improvement in tps for read-only service was found. You see a change in hardware architecture with the new setup. They now recommend using a primary and multiple standby servers, a single controller per server, and a single set of disks in RAID1. Previously the recommendation was to have a primary and secondary server with two controllers per server and a set of mirrored disks per controller. The changes increase performance, availability, and hardware utilization. They also have a useful looking best practices document for High Availability called   Maximum Availability Architecture (MAA)  .</p><p>6 0.070482217 <a title="487-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-27-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_January_28_2010.html">767 high scalability-2010-01-27-Hot Scalability Links for January 28 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The 2008 MySQL Conference & Expo has now closed, but what is still open for viewing is all the MySQL scaling knowledge that was shared.   Planet MySQL   is a great source of the goings on:      Scaling out MySQL: Hardware today and tomorrow  by Jeremy Cole and Eric Bergen of Proven Scaling. In it are answered all the big questions of life: What about 64-bit? How many cores? How much memory? Shared storage? Finally we learn the secrets of true happiness.   Panel Video: Scaling MySQL? Up or Out? . Don't have time? Take a look at the  Diamond Note  excellent game day summary. Companies like MySQL, Sun, Flickr, Fotolog, Wikipedia, Facebook and YouTube share intel on how many web servers they have, how they handle failure, and how they scale.

<p>Introduction: As users come to depend on MySQL, they find that they have to deal with issues of reliability, scalability, and performance--issues that are not well documented but are critical to a smoothly functioning site. This book is an insider's guide to these little understood topics. Author Jeremy Zawodny has managed large numbers of MySQL servers for mission-critical work at Yahoo!, maintained years of contacts with the MySQL AB team, and presents regularly at conferences. Jeremy and Derek have spent months experimenting, interviewing major users of MySQL, talking to MySQL AB, benchmarking, and writing some of their own tools in order to produce the information in this book. In High Performance MySQL you will learn about MySQL indexing and optimization in depth so you can make better use of these key features. You will learn practical replication, backup, and load-balancing strategies with information that goes beyond available tools to discuss their effects in real-life environments. And you</p><p>4 0.69134086 <a title="487-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-01-MySQL_Database_Scale-out_and_Replication_for_High_Growth_Businesses.html">455 high scalability-2008-12-01-MySQL Database Scale-out and Replication for High Growth Businesses</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It is widely recognized that MySQL is the most popular database software in the world. Since its inception in 1995, there have been 11 million product installations around the world in a wide variety of markets. There are more installations of MySQL in use today than any other database architecture. From startup companies hoping to be the next Web2.0 poster child to large global enterprises, the MySQL database architecture has proven to be flexible, extendable, scalable, and more than capable of filling high-capacity database roles in very different venues.</p><p>5 0.68753386 <a title="487-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-11-FictionPress%3A_Publishing_6_Million_Works_of_Fiction_on_the_Web.html">1281 high scalability-2012-07-11-FictionPress: Publishing 6 Million Works of Fiction on the Web</a></p>
<p>Introduction: FictionPress operates both FictionPress.com and FanFiction.net and is home to over 6 million works of fiction, with millions of writers/readers participating from around the world in over 30 languages.
 
 Issues addressed :
  
 Support complex and efficient indexes at 100+ million rows. 
 Predicable and consistent performance regardless of data size growth. 
 Fast recovery. 
 Ensuring Predictable Performance at Scale 
  
 The Challenge :
 
FictionPress offers a number of interactive features to its large user base. These include discussion forums, in-site messaging and user reviews. FictionPress made the decision to build its own discussion forums to meet its strict security and performance requirements. Xing Li, CTO of FictionPress, noted that the site “needs to host hundreds of thousands of forums. Existing forum software doesn’t do this while meeting our performance and security targets.”

<p>Introduction: Informative and  well organized post on caching . Talks about: Why do we need cache?, What is Cache?, Cache Hit, Cache Miss, Storage Cost, Retrieval Cost, Invalidation, Replacement Policy, Optimal Replacement Policy, Caching Algorithms, Least Frequently Used (LFU), Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Recently Used 2(LRU2), Two Queues, Adaptive Replacement Cache (ACR), Most Recently Used (MRU), First in First out (FIFO), Distributed caching, Measuring Cache.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.75527292 <a title="487-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-08-Paper%3A_Sharding_with_Oracle_Database.html">487 high scalability-2009-01-08-Paper: Sharding with Oracle Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The upshot of the paper is Oracle rules and MySQL sucks for sharding. Which is technically probable, if you don't throw in minor points like cost and ease of use. The points where they think Oracle wins: online schema changes, more robust replication, higher availability, better corruption handling, better use of large RAM and multiple cores, better and better tested partitioning features, better monitoring, and better gas mileage.</p><p>5 0.75328505 <a title="487-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-07-Help_a_Scoble_out._What_should_Robert_ask_in_his_scalability_interview%3F.html">405 high scalability-2008-10-07-Help a Scoble out. What should Robert ask in his scalability interview?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the cool things about Mr. Scoble is he doesn't pretend to know everything, which can be an deadly boring affliction in this field. In this case Robert is asking for help in an upcoming interview. Maybe we can help? Here's Robert's plight:     I’m really freaked out. I have one of the biggest interviews of my life coming up and I’m way under qualified to host it.  It’s on Thursday and it’s about Scalability and Performance of Web Services.  Look at who will be on. Matt Mullenweg, founder of Automattic, the company behind WordPress (and behind this blog). Paul Bucheit, one of the founders of FriendFeed and the creator of Gmail (he’s also the guy who gave Google the “don’t be evil” admonishion). Nat Brown, CTO of iLike, which got six million users on Facebook in about 10 days.       What would you ask?</p><p>6 0.73395306 <a title="487-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-01-Google_Strategy%3A_Tree_Distribution_of_Requests_and_Responses.html">981 high scalability-2011-02-01-Google Strategy: Tree Distribution of Requests and Responses</a></p>

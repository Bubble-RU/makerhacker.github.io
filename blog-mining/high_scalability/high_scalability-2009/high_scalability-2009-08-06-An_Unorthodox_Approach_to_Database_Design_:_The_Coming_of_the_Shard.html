<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built
by a small group of people, under immense pressure, trying to get a lot of

<p>Introduction: Update:A very nice JavaWorld podcast interview withGoogle engineer Max Ross on
Hibernate Shards. Max defines Hibernate Shards (horizontal partitioning), how
it works (pretty well), virtual shards (don't ask), what they need to do in
the future (query, replication, operational tools), and how it relates to
Google AppEngine (not much).To scale you are supposed to partition your data.
Sounds good, but how do you do it? When you actually sit down to work out all
the details it's not that easy. Hibernate Shards to the rescue! Hibernate
shards is: an extension to the core Hibernate product that adds facilities for
horizontal partitioning. If you know the core Hibernate API you know the
shards API. No learning curve at all. Here is what a few members of the core
group had to say about the Hibernate Shards open source project. Although
there are some limitations, from the sound of it they are doing useful stuff
in the right way and it's very much worth looking at, especially if you use

<p>Introduction: Pinterest has been riding an exponential growth curve, doubling every month
and half. They've gone from 0 to 10s of billions of page views a month in two
years, from 2 founders and one engineer to over 40 engineers, from one little
MySQL server to 180 Web Engines, 240 API Engines, 88 MySQL DBs (cc2.8xlarge) +
1 slave each, 110 Redis Instances, and 200 Memcache Instances.Stunning growth.
So what's Pinterest's story? To tell their story we have our bards,
Pinterest'sYashwanth NelapatiandMarty Weiner, who tell the dramatic story of
Pinterest's architecture evolution in a talk titledScaling Pinterest. This is
the talk they would have liked to hear a year and half ago when they were
scaling fast and there were a lot of options to choose from. And they made a
lot of incorrect choices.This is a great talk. It's full of amazing details.
It's also very practical, down to earth, and it contains strategies adoptable
by nearly anyone. Highly recommended.Two of my favorite lessons from the
talk:Arc</p><p>6 0.24869357 <a title="672-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-09-Need_Help_with_Database_Scalability%3F_Understand_I-O.html">1514 high scalability-2013-09-09-Need Help with Database Scalability? Understand I-O</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I've been interested in sharding concepts since first hearing the term "shard"
a few years back. My interest had been piqued earlier, the first time I read
about Google's original approach to distributed search. It was described as a
hashtable-like system in which independent physical machines play the role of
the buckets. More recently, I needed the capacity and performance of a Sharded
system, but did not find helpful libraries or toolkits which would assist with
the configuration for my language of preference these days, which is Python.
And, since I had a few weeks on my hands, I decided I would begin the work of
creating these tools.The result of my initial work the Pyshards project, a
still-incomplete python and MySQL based horizontal partitioning and sharding
toolkit. HighScalability.com readers will already know that horizontal
partitioning is a data segmenting pattern in which distinct groups of physical
row-based datasets are distributed across multiple partitions. When the

<p>Introduction: The key (no pun intended) to understanding how to organize your dataset’s data
is to think of each shard not as an individual database, but as one large
singular database. Just as in a normal single server database setup where you
have a unique key for each row within a table, each row key within each
individual shard must be unique to the whole dataset partitioned across all
shards.There are a few different ways we can accomplish uniqueness of row keys
across a shard cluster. Each has its pro’s and con’s and the one chosen should
be specific to the problems you’re trying to solve.</p><p>5 0.84707916 <a title="672-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-13-Flickr_Architecture.html">152 high scalability-2007-11-13-Flickr Architecture</a></p>

Blog.Optimize everything else first, and then if performance still isn't good
enough, it's time to take a very bitter medicine.Update 3:Building Scalable
Databases: Pros and Cons of Various Database Sharding Schemesby Dare Obasanjo.
Excellent discussion of why and when you would choose a sharding architecture,
how to shard, and problems with sharding.Update 2:Mr. Moore gets to punt on
shardingby Alan Rimm-Kaufman of 37signals. Insightful article on design
tradeoffs and the evils of premature optimization. With more memory, more CPU,
and new tech like SSD, problems can be avoided before more exotic
architectures like sharding are needed. Add features not infrastructure.Jeremy

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ben Lowry, CEO ofPlaytomic. Playtomic is a game
analytics service implemented in about 8000 mobile, web and downloadable games
played by approximately 20 million people daily.Here's a good summary quote by
Ben Lowry on Hacker News:Just over 20,000,000 people hit my API yesterday
700,749,252 times, playing the ~8,000 games my analytics platform is
integrated in for a bit under 600 years in total play time. That's just
yesterday. There are lots of different bottlenecks waiting for people
operating at scale. Heroku and NodeJS, for my use case, eventually alleviated
a whole bunch of them very cheaply.Playtomic began with an almost exclusively
Microsoft.NET and Windows architecture which held up for 3 years before being
replaced with a complete rewrite using NodeJS.  During its lifetime the entire
platform grew from shared space on a single server to a full dedicated, then
spread to second dedicated, then the API server was offloaded to a VPS
provider and 4 - 6 fairl</p><p>3 0.95500082 <a title="672-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-25-Vertical_Scaling_Ascendant_-_How_are_SSDs_Changing__Architectures%3F.html">1291 high scalability-2012-07-25-Vertical Scaling Ascendant - How are SSDs Changing  Architectures?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With Amazonannouncing new High I/O 2TB SSD instancesthe age of SSD has almost
arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on
demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on
demand rate theprice per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:27 cents
($27K/100K IOPS) per vs$1.25 for disk.With the obvious benefits of giant SSD
machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it's interesting to consider: what
architecture decisions might you make differently in the future?More Headroom
for Vertical Scaling Simplifies EverythingThe beauty of higher hardware
performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows
developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This
has always been the allure ofvertical scalingand is well realized by SSDs
through a combination of high throughput, low latencies, and just as
important, high densities.We have a few early examples showing the performance

<p>Introduction: Here are a few updates on the articlePaper: Don't Settle For Eventual:
Scalable Causal Consistency For Wide-Area Storage With COPS from Mike Freedman
and Wyatt Lloyd.Q: How software architectures could change in response to
casual+ consistency?A: I don't really think they would much. Somebody would
still run a two-tier architecture in their datacenter:  a front-tier of
webservers running both (say) PHP and our client library, and a back tier of
storage nodes running COPS.  (I'm not sure if it was obvious given the
discussion of our "thick" client -- you should think of the COPS client
dropping in where a memcache client library does...albeit ours has per-session
state.) Q: Why not just use vector clocks?A: The problem with vector clocks
and scalability has always been that the size of vector clocks in O(N), where
N is the number of nodes.  So if we want to scale to a datacenter with 10K
nodes, each piece of metadata must have size O(10K).  And in fact, vector
clocks alone only allow yo</p><p>5 0.95234513 <a title="672-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-20-Product%3A_Amazon%27s_SimpleDB.html">498 high scalability-2009-01-20-Product: Amazon's SimpleDB</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 35:How and Why Glue is Using Amazon SimpleDB instead of a Relational
Database. Discusses a key design decision that required duplicating data in
order to mimic RDBMS joins:Given the trade off between potential
inconsistencies and scalability, social services have to choose the
latter.Update 34: Apparently Amazon pulled this article. I'm not sure what
that means. Maybe time went backwards or something?Amazon dramatically drops
SimpleDB pricing to $0.25 per GB per month from $1.50 per GB. This puts
SimpleDB on par withGoogle App Engine. They also announced a few new
features:a SQL-like SELECT API as well as a Batch Put operation to streamline
uploading of multiple items or attributes. One of the complaints against
SimpleDB is that programmers end up writing too much code to do simple things.
These features and a much cheaper price should help considerably. And you can
store lots of data now. GAE is still capped.Update 33: Amazon announcesElastic

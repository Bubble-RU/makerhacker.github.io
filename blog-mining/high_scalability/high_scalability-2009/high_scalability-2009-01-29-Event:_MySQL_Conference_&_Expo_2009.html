<p>Introduction: The 5th annual MySQL Conference & Expo, co-presented by Sun Microsystems,
MySQL and O'Reilly Media.HappeningApril 20-23, 2009 in Santa Clara, CA, at the
Santa Clara Convention Center and Hyatt Regency Santa Clara, brings over 2,000
open source and database enthusiasts together to harness the power of MySQL
and celebrate the huge MySQL ecosystem. All around the world, people just like
you are innovating with MySQLâ&euro;&rdquo;and MySQL is fueling the innovation engine by
releasing new mission critical solutions to help you work smarter. This deeply
technical conference brings all of that creativity, energy, and knowledge
together in one place for four very full days.Early registration ends February
16, 2009.The largest gathering of MySQL developers, users, and DBAs worldwide,
the event reflects MySQL's wide-ranging appeal and capabilities. The open
atmosphere of the MySQL Conference & Expo helps IT professionals and community
members launch and develop the best database applications, tools, and

Provisioned IOPS volumes are not total shit. This injects the man with a few
weeks of runway.@markzohar: It is amazing to witness the efficiency &
scalability of algorithms. Given the choice, build your tech company on
algorithms not code.Your Bottleneck is Dead. Long Live Your Bottleneck.
Mailinator's Paul Tyma brings up the interesting notion that once bottlenecks
have moved to the CPU because programs can nolonger hide behind IO overhead -
code efficiency becomes important again.Facebook Moving To The JVM: The main

<p>Introduction: In a great article, Amazon S3 Performance Tips & Tricks, Doug Grismore,
Director of Storage Operations for AWS, has outed the secret arcana normally
reserved for Premium Developer Support customers on how to really use S3:Size
matters. Workloads with less than 50-100 total requests per second don't
require any special effort. Customers that routinely perform thousands of
requests per second need a plan.Automated partitioning. Automated systems
scale S3 horizontally by continuously splitting data into partitions based on
high request rates and the number of keys in a partition (which leads to slow
lookups). Lessons you've learned with sharding may also apply to S3.   Avoid
hot spots. Like most sharding schemes, you want to avoid hot spots by the
smart selection of key names. S3 objects are stored inbuckets.  Each object is
identified using a key. Keys are kept in sorted order. Keys in S3 are
partitioned by prefix. Objects that sort together are stored together, so you
want to select key</p><p>4 0.94440109 <a title="504-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-17-World_of_Warcraft%27s_Lead_designer_Rob_Pardo_on_the_Role_of_the_Cloud_in_Games.html">1342 high scalability-2012-10-17-World of Warcraft's Lead designer Rob Pardo on the Role of the Cloud in Games</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a really far ranging and insightful interview by Steve Peterson: Game
Industry Legends: Rob Pardo, where the future of gaming is discussed, there
was a section on how the cloud might be used in games. I know there are a lot
of game developers in my audience, so I thought it might be useful:Q. If the
game is free-to-play but I have to download 10 gigabytes to try it out, that
can keep me from trying it. That's part of what cloud gaming is trying to
overcome; do you think cloud gaming is going to make some inroads because of
those technical issues? Rob Pardo: I certainly think there's a lot of
potential in cloud gaming, it's just picking the right games. There's a lot of
hurdles for cloud gaming to overcome, one of which is having to have all these
servers to be able to host all these games, since it's not like you need any
less computing power to play these games. First of all you need someone with
the infrastructure that can have all those games up there. Another issue the

<p>Introduction: O'Reilly Radar's James Turner conducted avery informative interviewwith Joe
Stump, current CTO ofSimpleGeoand former lead architect atDigg, in which Joe
makes some of his usually insightful comments on his experience using
Cassandra vs MySQL. As Digg started out with aMySQL oriented architectureand
has recently beenmoving full speedto Cassandra, his observations on some of
their lessons learned and the motivation for the move are especially valuable.
Here are some of the key takeaways you find useful:Precompute on writes, make
reads fast. This is an oldie as a scaling strategy, but it's valuable to see
how SimpleGeo is applying it to their problem of finding entities within a
certain geographical region. Using Cassandra they've built two clusters: one
for indexes and one for records. The records cluster, as you might imagine, is
a simple data lookup. The index cluster has a carefully constructed key for
every lookup scenario. The indexes are computed on the write, so reads are
very fas</p><p>6 0.94361514 <a title="504-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-04-Business_continuity_with_real-time_data_integration.html">822 high scalability-2010-05-04-Business continuity with real-time data integration</a></p>

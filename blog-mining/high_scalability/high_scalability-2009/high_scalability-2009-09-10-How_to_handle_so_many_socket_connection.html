<p>Introduction: Awesome paper on how particular synchronization mechanisms scale on multi-core
architectures: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Synchronization but
Were Afraid to Ask.The goal is to pick a locking approach that doesn't degrade
as the number of cores increase. Like everything else in life, that doesn't
appear to be generically possible:None of the nine locking schemes we consider
consistently outperforms any other one, on all target architectures or
workloads. Strictly speaking, to seek optimality, a lock algorithm should thus
be selected based on the hardware platform and the expected workload.
Abstract:This paper presents the most exhaustive study of synchronization to
date. We span multiple layers, from hardware cache-coherence protocols up to
high-level concurrent software. We do so on different types architectures,
from single-socket - uniform and nonuniform - to multi-socket - directory and
broadcastbased - many-cores. We draw a set of observations that, roughly

changed and makes those changes available to you. Knowing what has changed can

<p>Introduction: Now that we have theC10K concurrent connection problemlicked, how do we level
up and support 10 million concurrent connections? Impossible you say. Nope,
systems right now are delivering 10 million concurrent connections using
techniques that are as radical as they may be unfamiliar.To learn how it's
done we turn toRobert Graham, CEO of Errata Security, and his absolutely
fantastic talk atShmoocon 2013calledC10M Defending The Internet At
Scale.Robert has a brilliant way of framing the problem that I've never heard
of before. He starts with a little bit of history, relating how Unix wasn't
originally designed to be a general server OS, it was designed to be a control
system for a telephone network. It was the telephone network that actually
transported the data so there was a clean separation between the control plane
and the data plane. Theproblem is we now use Unix servers as part of the data
plane, which we shouldn't do at all. If we were designing a kernel for
handling one applicati</p><p>5 0.12029839 <a title="699-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-28-Pursue_robust_indefinite_scalability_with_the_Movable_Feast_Machine.html">1127 high scalability-2011-09-28-Pursue robust indefinite scalability with the Movable Feast Machine</a></p>
<p>Introduction: And now for something completely different, brought to you by David Ackley and
Daniel Cannon in their playfully thought provoking paper: Pursue robust
indefinite scalability, wherein they try to take a fresh look at neural
networks, starting from scratch.What is this strange thing calledindefinite
scalability? They sound like words that don't really go together:Indefinite
scalability is the property that the design can support open-ended
computational growth without substantial re-engineering, in as strict as sense
as can be managed. By comparison, many computer, algorithm, and network
designs -- even those that address scalability -- are only finitely scalable
because their scalability occurs within some finite space. For example, an in-
core sorting algorithm for a 32 bit machine can only scale to billions of
numbers before address space is exhausted and then that algorithm must be re-
engineered.Our idea is to expose indefinitely scalable computational power to
programmers using rei</p><p>6 0.11733934 <a title="699-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-19-Paper%3A_MegaPipe%3A_A_New_Programming_Interface_for_Scalable_Network_I-O.html">1478 high scalability-2013-06-19-Paper: MegaPipe: A New Programming Interface for Scalable Network I-O</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hidden in every computer is a hardware backplane for moving signals around.
Hidden in every application are ways of moving messages around and giving code
CPU time to process them. Unhiding those capabilities and making them first
class facilities for the programmer to control is the idea behind
AppBackplane.This goes directly against the trend of hiding everything from
the programmer and doing it all automagically. Which is great, until it
doesn't work. Then it sucks. And the approach of giving the programmer all the
power also sucks, until it's tuned to work together and performance is
incredible even under increasing loads. Then it's great.These are two
different curves going in opposite directions. You need to decide for your
application which curve you need to be on.AppBackplane is an example framework
supporting the multiple application architectures we talked about inBeyond
Threads And Callbacks. It provides a scheduling system that supports
continuous and high loads, meets crit</p><p>4 0.67456758 <a title="699-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-11-Low_Level_Scalability_Solutions_-_The_Conditioning_Collection.html">1421 high scalability-2013-03-11-Low Level Scalability Solutions - The Conditioning Collection</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We talked about 42 Monster Problems That Attack As Loads Increase. And inThe
Aggregation Collection we talked about the value of prioritizing work and
making smart queues as a way of absorbing and not reflecting traffic
spikes.Now we move on to our next batch of strategies where the theme
isconditioning, which is the idea of shaping and controlling flows of work
within your application...Use Resources Proportional To a Fixed LimitThis is
probably the most important rule for achieving scalability within an
application. What it means:Find the resource that has a fixed limit that you
know you can support. For example, a guarantee to handle a certain number of
objects in memory. So if we always use resources proportional to the number of
objects it is likely we can prevent resource exhaustion.Devise ways of tying
what you need to do to the individual resources.Some examples:Keep a list of
purchase orders with line items over $20 (or whatever). Do not keep a list of
the line items because t</p><p>5 0.66265845 <a title="699-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-14-New_Facebook_Chat_Feature_Scales_to_70_Million_Users_Using_Erlang.html">318 high scalability-2008-05-14-New Facebook Chat Feature Scales to 70 Million Users Using Erlang</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: Erlang at Facebook by Eugene Letuchy. How Facebook uses Erlang to
implement Chat, AIM Presence, and Chat Jabber support. I've done
someXMPPdevelopment so when I readFacebook was making a Jabber chat clientI
was really curious how they would make it work. While core XMPP is
straightforward, a number of protocol extensions like discovery, forms, chat
states, pubsub, multi user chat, and privacy lists really up the
implementation complexity. Some real engineering challenges were involved to
make this puppy scale and perform. It's not clear what extensions they've
implemented, but a blog entry by Facebook's Eugene Letuchy hits some of the
architectural challenges they faced and how they overcame them.A web based
Jabber client poses a few problems because XMPP, like most IM protocols, is an
asynchronous event driven system that pretty much assumes you have a full time
open connection. After logging in the server sends a client roster information
and presence information.

<p>Introduction: These are fromLaura Thomson of OmniTi:Profile early, profile often.Pick a
profiling tool and learn it in and out. Dev-ops cooperation is essential.The
most critical difference in organizations that handles crises well.Test on
production data.Code behavior (especially performance) is often data
driven.Track and trend.Understanding your historical performance
characteristics is essential for spotting emerging problems.Assumptions will
burn you.Systems are complex and often break in unexpected
ways.Decouple.Isolate performance failures.Cache.Caching is the core of most
optimizations.Federate.Data federation is taking a single data set and
spreading it across multiple database/application
servers.Replicate.Replication is making synchronized copies of data available
in more than one place.Avoid straining hard-to-scale resources.Some resources
are inherently hard to scale: Uncacheable' data, Data with a very high
read+write rate, Non-federatable data, Data in a black-boxUse a compiler
cache.</p><p>3 0.7612493 <a title="699-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-26-Paper%3A_Wikipedia%27s_Site_Internals%2C_Configuration%2C_Code_Examples_and_Management_Issues.html">134 high scalability-2007-10-26-Paper: Wikipedia's Site Internals, Configuration, Code Examples and Management Issues</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wikipedia andWikimediahave some of the best, most complete real-world
documentation on how to build highly scalable systems. This paper by Domas
Mituzas covers a lot of details about how Wikipedia works, including: an
overview of the different packages used (Linux, PowerDNS, LVS, Squid,
lighttpd, Apache, PHP5, Lucene, Mono, Memcached), how they use their CDN, how
caching works, how they profile their code, how they store their media, how
they structure their database access, how they handle search, how they handle
load balancing and administration. All with real code examples and examples of
configuration files. This is a really useful resource.Related

can connect to this socket and send data. this connection has to be maintained
for indefinite hours. Client are continously sending data . There are so many

<p>Introduction: The BBC's iPlayer site averages 8 million page views a day for 1.3 million
users. Technical Architect Simon Frost describes how they scaled their site
inScaling the BBC iPlayer to handle demand:Use frameworks. Frameworks support
component based development which makes it convenient for team development,
but can introduce delays that have to be minimized. Zend/PHP is used because
it supports components and is easy to recruit for.  MySQL is used for program
metadata. CouchDB is used for key-value access for fast read/write of user-
focused data.Prove architecture before building it. Eliminate guesswork by
coming up with alternate architectures and create prototypes to determine
which option works best. Balance performance with factors like ease of
development.Cache a lot. Data is cached in memcached for a few seconds to
minutes. Short cache invalidation periods keep the data up to date for the
users, but even these short periods make a huge difference in performance.

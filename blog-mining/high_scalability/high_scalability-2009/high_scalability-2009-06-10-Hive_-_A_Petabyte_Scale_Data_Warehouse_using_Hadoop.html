<p>Introduction: Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of Technology at Facebook gave a great presentation at UC San Diego on our favorite subject: " High Performance at Massive Scale –  Lessons learned at Facebook ". The abstract for the talk is:
  

Facebook has grown into one of the largest sites on the Internet today serving over 200 billion pages per month. The nature of social data makes engineering a site for this level of scale a particularly challenging proposition. In this presentation, I will discuss the aspects of social data that present challenges for scalability and will describe the the core architectural components and design principles that Facebook has used to address these challenges. In addition, I will discuss emerging technologies that offer new opportunities for building cost-effective high performance web architectures.

<p>Introduction: There’s some amount of debate whether Facebook  really  crossed over the one trillion page view per month threshold. While one report says it did,  another respected firm says it did not ; that its monthly page views are a mere 467 billion per month.


In the big scheme of things, the discrepancy is somewhat irrelevant, as neither show the  true  load on Facebook’s infrastructure – which is far more impressive a set of numbers than its externally measured “page view” metric.  Mashable reported in “ Facebook Surpasses 1 Trillion Pageviews per Month ” that the social networking giant saw “approximately 870 million unique visitors in June and 860 million in July” and followed up with some per visitor statistics, indicating “each visitor averaged approximately 1,160 page views in July and 40 per visit — enormous by any standard. Time spent on the site was around 25 minutes per user.”


From an architectural standpoint it’s not  just  about the page views. It’s about requests and responses,</p><p>5 0.20003738 <a title="624-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-16-Facebook%27s_New_Real-time_Messaging_System%3A_HBase_to_Store_135%2B_Billion_Messages_a_Month.html">943 high scalability-2010-11-16-Facebook's New Real-time Messaging System: HBase to Store 135+ Billion Messages a Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You may have read somewhere that Facebook has introduced a new  Social Inbox  integrating email, IM, SMS,  text messages, on-site Facebook messages. All-in-all they need to store over 135 billion messages a month. Where do they store all that stuff? Facebook's Kannan Muthukkaruppan gives the surprise answer in  The Underlying Technology of Messages :  HBase . HBase beat out MySQL, Cassandra, and a few others.
 
Why a surprise? Facebook created Cassandra and it was purpose built for an inbox type application, but they found Cassandra's eventual consistency model wasn't a good match for their new real-time Messages product. Facebook also has an extensive  MySQL infrastructure , but they found performance suffered as data set and indexes grew larger. And they could have built their own, but they chose HBase.
 
HBase is a   scaleout table store supporting very high rates of row-level updates over massive amounts of data  . Exactly what is needed for a Messaging system. HBase is also a colu</p><p>6 0.18157719 <a title="624-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-18-Building_your_own_Facebook_Realtime_Analytics_System__.html">1081 high scalability-2011-07-18-Building your own Facebook Realtime Analytics System  </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Recently, I was reading Todd Hoff's write-up on  FaceBook real time analytics system  . As usual, Todd did an excellent job in summarizing  this video  from Engineering Manager at Facebook  Alex Himel .
 
In  the first post , I’d like to summarize the case study, and consider some things that weren't mentioned in the summaries. This will lead to an architecture for building your own Realtime Time Analytics for Big-Data that might be easier to implement, using Facebook's experience as a starting point and guide as well as the experience gathered through a recent work with few of GigaSpaces customers. The  second post  provide a summary of that new approach as well as a pattern and a demo for building your own Real Time Analytics system..

<p>Introduction: Munin  the monitoring tool surveys all your computers and remembers what it saw. It presents all the information in graphs through a web interface. Its emphasis is on plug and play capabilities. After completing a installation a high number of monitoring plugins will be playing with no more effort.  Using Munin you can easily monitor the performance of your computers, networks, SANs, applications, weather measurements and whatever comes to mind. It makes it easy to determine "what's different today" when a performance problem crops up. It makes it easy to see how you're doing capacity-wise on any resources.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.88537556 <a title="624-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-10-Hive_-_A_Petabyte_Scale_Data_Warehouse_using_Hadoop.html">624 high scalability-2009-06-10-Hive - A Petabyte Scale Data Warehouse using Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post about using Hive and Hadoop for analytics comes straight from Facebook engineers.  Scalable analysis on large data sets has been core to the functions of a number of teams at Facebook - both engineering and non-engineering. Apart from ad hoc analysis and business intelligence applications used by analysts across the company, a number of Facebook products are also based on analytics.   These products range from simple reporting applications like Insights for the Facebook Ad Network, to more advanced kind such as Facebook's Lexicon product.   As a result a flexible infrastructure that caters to the needs of these diverse applications and users and that also scales up in a cost effective manner with the ever increasing amounts of data being generated on Facebook, is critical. Hive and Hadoop are the technologies that we have used to address these requirements at Facebook.

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my article  Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.  
 
Have we reached the end of scaling? That's what I asked myself one day after noticing a bunch of "The End of" headlines. We've reached  The End of History  because the Western liberal democracy is the "end point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and the final form of human government."  We've reached  The End of Science  because of the "fact that there aren't going to be any obvious, cataclysmic revolutions." We've even reached  The End of Theory  because all answers can be found in the continuous stream of data we're collecting. And doesn't always seem like we're at  The End of the World ?
 
Motivated by the prospect of everything ending, I began to wonder: have we really reached The End of Scaling?
 
For a while I thought this might be true. The reason I thought the End of Scaling might be near is because of the slow down of potential articles at m</p><p>4 0.81020761 <a title="624-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-23-The_7_Stages_of_Scaling_Web_Apps.html">391 high scalability-2008-09-23-The 7 Stages of Scaling Web Apps</a></p>
<p>Introduction: By John Engales CTO, Rackspace. Good presentation of the stages a typical successful website goes through: 
 
 Stage 1 - The Beginning: Simple architecture, low complexity. no redundancy. Firewall, load balancer, a pair of web servers, database server, and internal storage. 
 Stage 2 - More of the same, just bigger. 
 Stage 3 - The Pain Begins: publicity hits. Use reverse proxy, cache static content, load balancers, more databases, re-coding. 
 Stage 4 - The Pain Intensifies: caching with memcached, writes overload and replication takes too long, start database partitioning, shared storage makes sense for content, significant re-architecting for DB. 
 Stage 5 - This Really Hurts!: rethink entire application, partition on geography user ID, etc, create user clusters, using hashing scheme for locating which user belongs to which cluster. 
 Stage 6 - Getting a little less painful: scalable application and database architecture, acceptable performance, starting to add ne features again, op</p><p>5 0.78724492 <a title="624-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-28-Zynga_Needs_a_Server-side_Systems_Engineer.html">755 high scalability-2009-12-28-Zynga Needs a Server-side Systems Engineer</a></p>

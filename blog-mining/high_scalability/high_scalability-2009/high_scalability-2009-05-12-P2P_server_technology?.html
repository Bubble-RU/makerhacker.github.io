<p>Introduction: Web Log Stormingis an interactive, desktop-based Web Log Analyzer for Windows.
The whole new concept of log analysis makes it clearly different from any
other web log analyzer. Browse through statistics to get into details - down
to individual visitor's session. Check individual visitor behavior pattern and
how it fits into your desired scenario.Web Log Storming does far more than
just generate common reports - it displays detailed web site statistics with
interactive graphs and reports. Very complete detailed log analysis of
activity from every visitor to your web site is only a mouse-click away.In
other words, analyze your web logs like never before!It's easy to track
sessions, hits, page views, downloads, or whatever metric is most important to
each user. You can look at referring pages and see which search engines and
keywords were used to bring visitors to the site. Web site behavior, from the
top entry and exit pages, to the paths that users follow, can be analyzed. You
can learn</p><p>5 0.1099343 <a title="598-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-29-Too_many_databases.html">231 high scalability-2008-01-29-Too many databases</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,I am using drupal for my clients website, and was thinking is it possible
to host all ( about 500) of them on the same server(maybe VPS or
dedicated).Here is the situation..... Each clients website has a database with
about 50 tables each, all the databases are small in size about 2-5 MB ....
and the websites are low traffic websites with say.. 50 hits/day on avg....
that means about 2000 queries/db/day ..... (avg 40 queries per hit)....Wanted
to know if it is possible to have so many databases about 500 on the same
server?what are the things that i should look into if i should make this
happen?</p><p>6 0.10896786 <a title="598-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-05-Sponsored_Post%3A_Digital_Ocean%2C_NetDNA%2C_Torbit%2C_Velocity%2C_Reality_Check_Network%2C_Gigaspaces%2C_AiCache%2C_Logic_Monitor%2C_Attribution_Modeling%2C_AppDynamics%2C_CloudSigma%2C_ManageEnine%2C_Site24x7.html">1257 high scalability-2012-06-05-Sponsored Post: Digital Ocean, NetDNA, Torbit, Velocity, Reality Check Network, Gigaspaces, AiCache, Logic Monitor, Attribution Modeling, AppDynamics, CloudSigma, ManageEnine, Site24x7</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This paper is a great overview of different lightweight web servers. A lot of
websites use lightweight web servers to serve images and static content.
YouTube is one example:YouTube Architecture.breakSo if you need to improve
performance consider changing over a different web server for some types of
content.Overview:Recent years have enjoyed a florescence of interesting
implementations of Web servers, including lighttpd, litespeed, and mongrel,
among others. These Web servers boast different combinations of performance,
ease of administration, portability, security, and related values. The
following engineering study surveys the field of lightweight Web servers to
help you find one likely to meet the technical requirements of your next
project."Lightweight" Web servers like lighttpd, litespeed, and mongrel can
offer dramatic benefits for your projects. This article surveys the
possibilities and shows how they apply to you.Important dimensions for

<p>Introduction: For some special reason, I'm trying to make a web server able to get all the
DNS names mapped to its IP. Let me explain more, I'm creating a website that
will run in a web farm, every web server in the farm will have some subdomains
mapped to its ip, what I want is that whenever my application starts on a web
server is to be able to get all the subdomains mapped/assigned to that server,
e.g. sub1.mydomain.com, sub2.mydomain.com. I understand that I have to use
reverse dns lookup (i.e. give the IP get the domain name), but I also want to
get all the subdomains not just the first one that maps to that IP. I've been
reading about DNS on the internet but I don't seem to find any information on
how to achieve what I want, normally you use dns to get the ip of a domain but
I'm not sure that all servers enable reverse lookup.The problem is that I'm
still not sure whether I'll host my own DNS server or use the services of some
company (many companies offer DNS hosting services), so, my questio</p><p>6 0.73885345 <a title="598-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-04-Try_Squid_as_a_Reverse_Proxy.html">59 high scalability-2007-08-04-Try Squid as a Reverse Proxy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hey, it's HighScalability time: Quotable Quotes:@ibogost: Disabling features
of SimCity due to ineffective central infrastructure is probably the most
realistic simulation of the modern city.antirez: The point is simply to show
how SSDs can't be considered, currently, as a bit slower version of memory.
Their performance characteristics are a lot more about, simply, "faster
disks".@jessenoller: I only use JavaScript so I can gain maximum scalability
across multiple cores. Also unicorns. Paint thinner gingerbread@liammclennan:
high-scalability ruby. Why bother?@scomma: Problem with BitCoin is not
scalability, not even usability. It's whether someone will crack the algorithm
and render BTC entirely useless.@webclimber: Amazing how often I find myself
explaining that scalability is not magical@mvmsan: Flash as Primary Storage -
Highest Cost, Lack of HA, scalability and management features #flash #SSD
#CIO@pneuman42: Game servers are the *worst* scalability problem. Most
services start smal</p><p>2 0.92393255 <a title="598-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-04-Dremel%3A_Interactive_Analysis_of_Web-Scale_Datasets_-_Data_as_a_Programming_Paradigm.html">871 high scalability-2010-08-04-Dremel: Interactive Analysis of Web-Scale Datasets - Data as a Programming Paradigm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If Google was a boxer then MapReduce would be a probing right hand that sets
up the massive left hook that is Dremel, Google's--scalable (thousands of
CPUs, petabytes of data, trillions of rows), SQL based, columnar, interactive
(results returned in seconds), ad-hoc--analytics system. If Google was a
magician then MapReduce would be the shiny thing that distracts the mind while
the trick goes unnoticed. I say that because even though Dremel has been
around internally at Google since 2006, we have not heard a whisper about it.
All we've heard about is MapReduce, clones of which have inspired entire new
industries.Tricky.Dremel, according to Brian Bershad, Director of Engineering
at Google, is targeted at solvingBigData class problems:While we all know that
systems are huge and will get even huger, the implications of this size on
programmability, manageability, power, etc. is hard to comprehend. Alfred
noted that the Internet is predicted to be carrying a zetta-byte (1021bytes)

<p>Introduction: Is there any type of server technology that allows visitors to a website to
become part of the server? Like with bittorrent, users share some of their
bandwidth, so would this be possible with web servers where a person goes to a
website, downloads and runs the software which makes their internet connection
and cpu and hdd become part of the web server?</p><p>5 0.91997564 <a title="598-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-02-Using_the_Ambient_Cloud_as_an_Application_Runtime.html">786 high scalability-2010-03-02-Using the Ambient Cloud as an Application Runtime</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.The future looks many,
big, complex, and adaptive:Many clouds.Many servers.Many operating
systems.Many languages.Many storage services.Many database services.Many
software services.Many adjunct human networks (like Mechanical Turk).Many fast
interconnects.Many CDNs.Many cache memory pools.Many application profiles
(simple request-response, live streaming, computationally complex, sensor
driven, memory intensive, storage intensive, monolithic, decomposable,
etc).Many legal jurisdictions. Don't want to perform a function on Patriot Act
"protected" systems then move the function elsewhere.Many SLAs.Many data
driven pricing policies that like airplane pricing algorithms will price
"seats" to maximize profit using multi-variate time sensitive pricing
models.Many competitive products. The need to defend your territory never
seems to go away. Though what will map to s</p><p>6 0.91910082 <a title="598-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-26-Map-Reduce_for_Machine_Learning_on_Multicore.html">581 high scalability-2009-04-26-Map-Reduce for Machine Learning on Multicore</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I've been getting asked about this a lot lately so I figured I'd just blog about it. Products like WebSphere eXtreme Scale work by taking a dataset, partitioning it using a key and then assigning those partitions to a number of JVMs. Each partition usually has a primary and a replica. These 'shards' are assigned to JVMs. A transactional application typically interacts with the data on a single partition at a time. This means the transaction is executed in a single JVM. A server box will be able to do M of those transactions per second and it scales because N boxes does MN (M multiplied by N) transactions per second. Increase N, you get more transactions per second. Availability is very good because a transaction only depends on 1 of the N servers that are currently online. Any of the other (N-1) servers can go down or fail with no impact on the transaction. So, single partition transactions can scale indefinitely from a throughput point of view, offer very consistent response times and</p><p>3 0.16669959 <a title="625-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-24-Build_your_own_twitter_like_real_time_analytics_-_a_step_by_step_guide.html">1251 high scalability-2012-05-24-Build your own twitter like real time analytics - a step by step guide</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Major social networking platforms like Facebook and Twitter have developed their own architectures for handling the need for real-time analytics on huge amounts of data. However, not every company has the need or resources to build their own Twitter-like solution. 
 
 In this example we have taken  the same Twitter/Facebook-like blueprint, and made it simple enough for developers to implement.   We have taken the following approach in our implementation: 
  
 Use In Memory Data Grid (XAP) for handling the real time stream data-processing. 
 BigData data-base (Cassandra) for storing the historical data and manage the trend analytics  
 Use Cloudify (cloudifysource.org)  for managing and automating the deployment on private or public cloud 
  
The example demonstrate a simple case of word count analytics. It uses Spring Social to plug-in to real twitter feeds. The solution is designed to efficiently cope with getting and processing the large volume of tweets.

<p>Introduction: A lot of people seem to passionately dislike the term   NewSQL   , or pretty much any newly coined term for that matter, but after watching Alex Lloyd, Senior Staff Software Engineer Google, give a great talk    on Building Spanner   , that’s the term that fits Spanner best.  
 
 Spanner wraps the SQL + transaction model of OldSQL around the reworked bones of a globally distributed NoSQL system. That seems NewSQL to me.    As Spanner is a not so distant cousin of BigTable, the NoSQL component should be no surprise. Spanner is charged with spanning millions of machines inside any number of geographically distributed datacenters. What is surprising is how OldSQL has been embraced. In an    earlier 2011 talk    given by Alex at the HotStorage conference, the reason for embracing OldSQL was the desire to make it easier and faster for programmers to build applications. The main ideas will seem quite familiar:

<p>Introduction: Abstract: When designing distributed web services, there are three properties that are commonly desired: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. It is impossible to achieve all three.

<p>Introduction: We are not yet at the End of History for database theory as  Peter Bailis  and the  Database Group  at UC Berkeley continue to prove with a great  companion blog post  to their new paper:  Scalable Atomic Visibility with RAMP Transactions . I like the approach of pairing a blog post with a paper. A paper almost by definition is formal, but a blog post can help put a paper in context and give it some heart.
 
From the abstract:
  

Databases can provide scalability by partitioning data across several servers. However, multi-partition, multi-operation transactional access is often expensive, employing coordination-intensive locking, validation, or scheduling mechanisms. Accordingly, many real-world systems avoid mechanisms that provide useful semantics for  multi-partition operations . This leads to incorrect behavior for a large class of applications including secondary indexing,  foreign key enforcement, and materialized view maintenance . In this work, we identify a new isolation mode</p><p>3 0.66118795 <a title="625-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-23-Paper%3A_Calvin%3A_Fast_Distributed_Transactions_for_Partitioned_Database_Systems.html">1463 high scalability-2013-05-23-Paper: Calvin: Fast Distributed Transactions for Partitioned Database Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Distributed transactions are costly because they use  agreement protocols . Calvin says, surprisingly, that using a deterministic database allows you to avoid the use of agreement protocols. The approach is to use a deterministic transaction layer that does all the hard work before acquiring locks and the beginning of transaction execution.      Overview:   Many distributed storage systems achieve high data access throughput via partitioning and replication, each system with its own advantages and tradeoffs. In order to achieve high scalability, however, today’s systems generally reduce transactional support, disallowing single transactions from spanning multiple partitions. Calvin is a practical transaction scheduling and data replication layer that uses a deterministic ordering guarantee to signiﬁcantly reduce the normally prohibitive contention costs associated with distributed transactions. Unlike previous deterministic database system prototypes, Calvin supports disk-based storage</p><p>4 0.66064709 <a title="625-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-16-Paper%3A_Warp%3A_Multi-Key_Transactions_for_Key-Value_Stores.html">1459 high scalability-2013-05-16-Paper: Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Looks like an interesting take on "a completely asynchronous, low-latency transaction management protocol, in line with the fully distributed NoSQL architecture."
 
 Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores Â overview:
  

Implementing ACID transactions has been a longstanding challenge for NoSQL systems. Because these systems are based on a sharded architecture, transactions necessarily require coordination across multiple servers. Past work in this space has relied either on heavyweight protocols such as Paxos or clock synchronization for this coordination.


This paper presents a novel protocol for coordinating distributed transactions with ACID semantics on top of a sharded data store. Called linear transactions, this protocol achieves scalability by distributing the coordination task to only those servers that hold relevant data for each transaction. It achieves high performance by serializing only those transactions whose concurrent execution could potentially yield a vio</p><p>5 0.64694738 <a title="625-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-01-Myth%3A_Eric_Brewer_on_Why_Banks_are_BASE_Not_ACID_-_Availability_Is_Revenue_.html">1450 high scalability-2013-05-01-Myth: Eric Brewer on Why Banks are BASE Not ACID - Availability Is Revenue </a></p>
<p>Introduction: In   NoSQL: Past, Present, Future    Eric Brewer  has a particularly fine section on explaining the often hard to understand ideas of   BASE   (Basically Available, Soft State, Eventually Consistent),   ACID   (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability),   CAP   (Consistency Availability, Partition Tolerance), in terms of a pernicious long standing myth about the sanctity of consistency in banking.
    Myth   : Money is important, so banks   must   use transactions to keep money safe and consistent, right? 
    Reality   : Banking transactions are inconsistent, particularly for ATMs. ATMs are designed to have a normal case behaviour and a partition mode behaviour. In partition mode Availability is chosen over Consistency. 
   Why?   1)  Availability correlates with revenue and consistency generally does not.  2)  Historically there was never an idea of perfect communication so everything was partitioned.

consisting of hundreds of systems, thousands of processors, terabytes of
memory and a petabyte of storage that supports users running common off-the-

<p>Introduction: One of the world's leading technical institutes, the Tokyo Institute of
Technology (Tokyo Tech) created the fastest supercomputer in Asia, and one of
the largest outside of the United States. Using Sun x64 servers and data
servers deployed in a grid architecture, Tokyo Tech built a cost-effective,
flexible supercomputer that meets the demands of compute and data-intensive
applications. Built in just 35 days, the TSUBAME grid includes hundreds of
systems incorporating thousands of processor cores and terabytes of memory,
and delivers 47.38 trillion floating-point operations per second (TeraFLOPS)
of sustained LINPACK benchmark performance and 1.1 petabyte of storage to
users running common off-the-shelf applications. Based on the deployment
architecture, the grid is expected to reach 100 TeraFLOPS in the future.This
article provides an overview of the Tokyo Tech grid, named TSUBAME. The first

<p>Introduction: A software-based distributed caching system such as memcached is an important
piece of today's largest Internet sites that support millions of concurrent
users and deliver user-friendly response times. The distributed nature of
memcached design transforms 1000s of servers into one large caching pool with
gigabytes of memory per node. This blog entry explores single-instance
memcached scalability for a few usage patterns.Table below shows out-of-the-
box (no custom OS rewrites or networking tuning required) performance with 10G
networking hardware and one single-socket UltraSPARC T2-based server with 8
cores and 8 threads per core (64 threads on a chip)...Object Size / Ops/Sec /

<p>Introduction: Lightcloud is a distributed and persistentkey-value databasefromPlurk.com.
Performance is said to be comparable to memcached. It's different
thanmemcachedbbecause it scales out horizontally by adding new nodes. It's
different than memcached because it persists to disk, it's not just a cache.
Now you haveone more optionin the never ending quest to ditch the RDBMS.Their
website does a nice job explaining the system:Built on Tokyo Tyrant. One of
the fastest key-value databases [benchmark]. Tokyo Tyrant has been in
development for many years and is used in production by Plurk.com, mixi.jp and
scribd.com (to name a few)...Great performance (comparable to memcached!)Can
store millions of keys on very few servers - tested in productionScale out by
just adding nodesNodes are replicated via master-master replication. Automatic

<p>Introduction: It's not often you get so enthusiastic a recommendation for a paper as Sergio
Bossa gives Memory Barriers: a Hardware View for Software Hackers: If you only
want to read one piece about CPUs architecture, cache coherency and memory
barriers, make it this one.It is a clear and well written article. It even has
a quiz. What's it about?So what possessed CPU designers to cause them to
inﬂict memory barriers on poor unsuspecting SMP software designers?In short,
because reordering memory references allows much better performance, and so
memory barriers are needed to force ordering in things like synchronization
primitives whose correct operation depends on ordered memory
references.Getting a more detailed answer to this question requires a good
understanding of how CPU caches work, and especially what is required to make
caches really work well. The following sections:present the structure of a
cache,describe how cache-coherency protocols ensure that CPUs agree on the
value of each location</p><p>6 0.56826371 <a title="695-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-01-More_Chips_Means_Less_Salsa.html">505 high scalability-2009-02-01-More Chips Means Less Salsa</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I had posted a note the other day about collectl and its ganglia interface but
perhaps I wasn't provocative enough to get any responses so let me ask it a
different way, specifically how do people monitor their clusters and more
importantly how often? Do you monitor to get a general sense of what the
system is doing OR do you monitor with the expectation that when something
goes wrong you'll have enough data to diagnose the problem? Or both? I suspect
both...Many cluster-based monitoring tools tend to have a data collection
daemon running on each target node which periodically sends data to some
central management station. That machine typically writes the data to some
database from which it can then extract historical plots. Some even put up
graphics in real-time.From my experience working with large clusters - and I'm
talking either many hundreds or even 1000s of nodes, most have to limit both
the amount of data they manage centrally as well as the frequency that they
collect it, oth</p><p>4 0.65039903 <a title="695-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-16-Blog%3A_MySQL_Performance_Blog_-_Everything_about_MySQL_Performance._.html">15 high scalability-2007-07-16-Blog: MySQL Performance Blog - Everything about MySQL Performance. </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Should you pay more in the cloud or pay less for bare metal in the datacenter?
This is a crucial decision point facing startups today. Which way should you
go? In thisWebpulp.tv interview, Joe Stump, always a go-to guy when you need a
metric ass-ton (a favorite expression of Joe's) of good advice on cutting edge
practices for the modern startup, laughs at conventional wisdom by sayingthe
cloud is really not more expensive than bare metal.The argument for a cheaper
cloud has a three main points:Raw Hardware Costs are Close. Buying hardware is
cheaper than renting hardware from Amazon, but it's close when you
considerreserved instances. A reserved instance costs about $250 a year and a
new server costs about $1500. Let's say Amazon is 30% slower. That means for a
cluster of 20 machines you would need a another 7 servers. This takes 10
minutes and 4 button clicks to provision on the cloud (the advantage of a
scale-out architecture + automation + cloud aware tools). So 7 extra servers

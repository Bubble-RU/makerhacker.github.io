<p>Introduction: Update:   Social networks in the database: using a graph database . A nice post on representing, traversing, and performing other common social network operations using a graph database.  If you are  Digg  or  LinkedIn  you can build your own speedy graph database to represent your complex social network relationships. For those of more modest means  Neo4j , a graph database, is a good alternative.  A graph is a collection nodes (things) and edges (relationships) that connect pairs of nodes. Slap properties (key-value pairs) on nodes and relationships and you have a surprisingly powerful way to represent most anything you can think of. In a graph database "relationships are first-class citizens. They connect two nodes and both nodes and relationships can hold an arbitrary amount of key-value pairs. So you can look at a graph database as a key-value store, with full support for relationships."  A graph looks something like:    For more lovely examples take a look at the  Graph Image Gal</p><p>3 0.31989396 <a title="621-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-10-Paper%3A_Graph_Databases_and_the_Future_of_Large-Scale_Knowledge_Management.html">626 high scalability-2009-06-10-Paper: Graph Databases and the Future of Large-Scale Knowledge Management</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Relational databases, document databases, and distributed hash tables get most of the hype these days, but there's another option: graph databases. Back to the future it seems. Here's a really interesting paper by Marko A. Rodriguez introducing the graph model and it's extension to representing the world wide web of data.     
   Modern day open source and commercial graph databases can store on the order of 1 billion relationships with some databases reaching the 10 billion mark. These developments are making the graph database practical for applications that require large-scale knowledge structures. Moreover, with the Web of Data standards set forth by the Linked Data community, it is possible to interlink graph databases across the web into a giant global knowledge structure.

<p>Introduction: At some point as a programmer you might have the insight/fear that all programming is just doing stuff to other stuff.
 
Then you may observe after coding the same stuff over again that stuff in a program often takes the form of interacting patterns of flows.
 
Then you may think hey, a program isn't only useful for coding datastructures, but a program is a kind of datastructure and that with a meta level jump you could program a program in terms of flows over data and flow over other flows.
 
That's the kind of stuff Prismatic is making available in the Graph extension to their  plumbing  package ( code examples ), which is described in an excellent post:  Graph: Abstractions for Structured Computation .

<p>Introduction: GraphChi  uses a  Parallel Sliding Windows  method which can: process a graph with mutable edge values efficiently from disk, with only a small number of non-sequential disk accesses, while supporting the asynchronous model of computation.
 
 
 
The result is graphs with billions of edges can be processed on just a single machine. It uses a vertex-centric computation model similar to  Pregel , which supports iterative algorithims as apposed to the batch style of MapReduce.  Streaming graph updates  are supported.
 
About GraphChi, Carlos Guestrin, codirector of Carnegie Mellon's Select Lab,  says :
  

A Mac Mini running GraphChi can analyze Twitter's social graph from 2010—which contains 40 million users and 1.2 billion connections—in 59 minutes. "The previous published result on this problem took 400 minutes using a cluster of about 1,000 computers

I think that the main reason so many people  have come to see SQL as the source of all evil is the fact that,  traditionally, the query language was burned into the database  implementation. So by saying NoSQL you basically say "No" to the  traditional non-scalable RDBMS implementations.
 
This view has  brought on a flood of alternative query languages, each aiming to solve a  different aspect that is missing in the traditional SQL query approach,  such as a document model, or that provides a simpler approach, such as  Key/Value query.
 
Most of the people I speak with seem fairly confused on this subject,  and tend to use query semantics and architecture interchangeably. In  Part I  of this post i tried to provide quick overview of what  each query term stands for in the context of the NoSQL world .  Part II  illustrates those ide</p><p>2 0.91580033 <a title="621-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-13-Strategy%3A_Facebook_Tweaks_to_Handle_6_Time_as_Many_Memcached_Requests.html">464 high scalability-2008-12-13-Strategy: Facebook Tweaks to Handle 6 Time as Many Memcached Requests</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Our latest strategy is taken from a  great post by Paul Saab of Facebook , detailing how with changes Facebook has made to memcached they have:
  ...been able to scale memcached to handle 200,000 UDP requests per second with an average latency of 173 microseconds. The total throughput achieved is 300,000 UDP requests/s, but the latency at that request rate is too high to be useful in our system. This is an amazing increase from 50,000 UDP requests/s using the stock version of Linux and memcached.  
To scale Facebook has hundreds of thousands of TCP connections open to their memcached processes. First, this is still amazing. It's not so long ago you could have never done this. Optimizing connection use was always a priority because the OS simply couldn't handle large numbers of connections or large numbers of threads or large numbers of CPUs. To get to this point is a big accomplishment. Still, at that scale there are problems that are often solved.  Some of the problem Facebook faced a</p><p>3 0.91367394 <a title="621-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-08-4_Scalability_Themes_from_Surgecon.html">917 high scalability-2010-10-08-4 Scalability Themes from Surgecon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Haas in his  SURGE Recap  of the  Surge  conference, reflected a bit, and came up with an interesting checklist of general themes from what he was seeing. I'm directly quoting his post, so please see the post for a full discussion. He uses this framework to think about the larger picture and where PostgreSQL stands in its progression.
  
  Make use of the academic literature .  Inventing your own way to do something is fine, but at least consider the possibility that someone smarter than you has thought about this problem before.  
  Failures are inevitable, so plan for them .   Try to minimize the possibility of cascading failures, and plan in advance how you can operate in degraded mode if disaster (or the Slashdot effect) strikes.  
  Disk technology matters .  Drive firmware bugs are common and nightmarish, and you can expect very limited help from the manufacturer, especially if the drive is billed as consumer-grade rather than enterprise-grade. SSDs can save you a lot of m</p><p>4 0.90191019 <a title="621-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-26-End-To-End_Performance_Study_of_Cloud_Services.html">831 high scalability-2010-05-26-End-To-End Performance Study of Cloud Services</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cloud computing promises a number of advantages for the deployment of data-intensive applications. Most prominently, these include reducing cost with a pay-as-you-go pricing model and (virtually) unlimited throughput by adding servers if the workload increases. At the  Systems Group , ETH Zurich, we did an extensive  end-to-end performance study  to compare the major cloud offerings regarding their ability to fulfill these promises and their implied cost.
 
The focus of the work is on transaction processing (i.e., read and update work-loads), rather than analytics workloads. We used the  TPC-W , a standardized benchmark simulating a Web-shop, as the baseline for our comparison. The TPC-W defines that users are simulated through emulated browsers (EB) and issue page requests, called web-interactions (WI), against the system. As a major modification to the benchmark, we constantly increase the load from 1 to 9000 simultaneous users to measure the scalability and cost variance of the syst</p><p>5 0.90035564 <a title="621-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-31-Read_HighScalability_on_Your_Mobile_Phone_Using_WidSets_Widgets.html">293 high scalability-2008-03-31-Read HighScalability on Your Mobile Phone Using WidSets Widgets</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jean-Paul de Vooght of our Switzerland contingent created a nifty little WidSets widget that lets you better read HighScalability from your mobile phone. I thought untethered readers might like to give it a try. Thanks to Jean-Paul for making it available!     WidSets is:   a simple service that brings you information normally accessed via the Internet by sending it directly to your mobile phone . Using mini-applications called widgets, it sends you the latest updates to your favorite websites. The system uses RSS feeds to push information from these websites directly to your mobile phone the minute theyâ&euro;&trade;re updated  .</p><p>6 0.89545727 <a title="621-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-18-limit_on_the_number_of_databases_open.html">252 high scalability-2008-02-18-limit on the number of databases open</a></p>

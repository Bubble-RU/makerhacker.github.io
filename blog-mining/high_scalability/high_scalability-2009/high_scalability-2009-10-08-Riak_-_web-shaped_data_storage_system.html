<p>Introduction: NoSQL is a trend that is gaining steam primarily in the world of Open Source. There are numerous NoSQL solutions available for all levels of complexity: from queryable distributed solutions like MongoDB to simpler distributed key-value storage solutions like Cassandra. Then there’s Riak, Tokyo Cabinet, Voldemort, CouchDB, and Redis. However, very few of these packaged NoSQL products are available for the other end of the platform market: Microsoft Windows. I’m going to outline what’s available now and briefly touch on some opportunities that are still available to the daring Microsoft engineer.

<p>Introduction: Update:  Presentation from the  NoSQL conference :  slides ,  video 1 ,  video 2 .  Project Voldemort is an open source implementation of the basic parts of  Dynamo (Amazonâ&euro;&trade;s Highly Available Key-value Store)  distributed key-value storage system. LinkedIn is using it in their production environment for "certain high-scalability storage problems where simple functional partitioning is not sufficient."

<p>Introduction: With the introduction of  Redis  your options in the key-value space just grew and your choice of which to pick just got a lot harder. But when you think about it, that's not a bad position to be in at all.  Redis (REmote DIctionary Server) -  a key-value database. It's similar to memcached but the dataset is not volatile, and values can be strings, exactly like in memcached, but also lists and sets with atomic operations to push/pop elements.   The key points are: open source; speed (benchmarked performing 110,000 SET operations, and 81,000 GETs, per second); persistence, but in an asynchronous way taking everything in memory; support for higher level data structures and atomic operations.  The home page is well organized so I'll spare the excessive-copying-to-make-this-post-longer. For a good overview of Redis take a look at Antonio Cangiano's article:  Introducing Redis: a fast key-value database .  If you are looking at a way to understand how Redis is different than something like</p><p>4 0.5927968 <a title="718-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-27-Comet_-_An_Example_of_the_New_Key-Code_Databases.html">979 high scalability-2011-01-27-Comet - An Example of the New Key-Code Databases</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Comet is an  active distributed key-value store  built at the University of Washington. The paper describing Comet is  Comet: An active distributed key-value store , there are also  slides , and a  MP3  of a presentation given at  OSDI '10 . Here's a succinct  overview of Comet :
  

Today's cloud storage services, such as Amazon S3 or peer-to-peer DHTs, are highly inflexible and impose a variety of constraints on their clients: specific replication and consistency schemes, fixed data timeouts, limited logging, etc. We witnessed such inflexibility first-hand as part of our Vanish work, where we used a DHT to store encryption keys temporarily. To address this issue, we built Comet, an extensible storage service that allows clients to inject snippets of code that control their data's behavior inside the storage service.

  
I found this paper quite interesting because it takes the initial steps of collocating code with a key-value store, which turns it into what might called a  key-code</p><p>5 0.56724536 <a title="718-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-02-Product%3A_Facebook%27s_Cassandra_-_A_Massive_Distributed_Store.html">649 high scalability-2009-07-02-Product: Facebook's Cassandra - A Massive Distributed Store</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2:  Presentation from the  NoSQL conference :  slides ,  video .  Update:   Why you won't be building your killer app on a distributed hash table  by Jonathan Ellis.  Why I think Cassandra is the most promising of the open-source distributed databases --you get a relatively rich data model and a distribution model that supports efficient range queries. These are not things that can be grafted on top of a simpler DHT foundation, so Cassandra will be useful for a wider variety of applications.    James Hamilton has published a thorough summary of Facebook's Cassandra, another scalable key-value store for your perusal. It's open source and is described as a "BigTable data model running on a Dynamo-like infrastructure." Cassandra is used in Facebook as an email search system containing 25TB and over 100m mailboxes.

<p>Introduction: I am in no way a music expert, but when I listen to  Symphony No. 4  by  Charles Ives , I imagine it's what a complex software/hardware system might sound like if we could hear its inner workings. Ives uses a lot of riotously competing rhythms in this work. It can sound discordant, yet the effect is deeply layered and eventually harmonious, just like the systems we use, create, and become part of.
 
I was pointed to this piece by someone who said there were two conductors. I'd never heard of such a thing! So I was intrigued. The first version of the performance sounds and looks great, but it unfortunately does not use two conductors. The second version uses two conductors, but is unfortunately just a snippet.
 
It's strikingly odd to see two conductors, but I imagine different parts of our systems using different conductors too, running at different rhythms, sometimes slow, sometimes fast, sometimes there are outbursts, sometimes in vicious conflict. Yet conceptually it all stills seem</p><p>same-blog 2 0.84253728 <a title="718-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-08-Riak_-_web-shaped_data_storage_system.html">718 high scalability-2009-10-08-Riak - web-shaped data storage system</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:   Short presentation  NYC by Bryan Fink  demonstrating the riak web-shaped data storage engine
 
 Riak  is another  new and interesting key-value store  entrant. Some of the features it offers are:
  
 Document-oriented 
 Scalable, decentralized key-value store 
 Standard  get ,  put , and  delete  operations.  
 Distributed, fault-tolerant storage solution. 
 Configurable levels of consistency, availability, and partition tolerance 
 Support for Erlang, Ruby, PHP, Javascript, Java, Python, HTTP 
   open source  and NoSQL 
 Pluggable backends 
 Eventing system 
 Monitoring 
 Inter-cluster replication 
 Links between records that can be traversed. 
 Map/Reduce. Functions are executed on the data node. One interesting difference is that a list keys are required to specify which values are operated on as apposed to running calculations on all values.

<p>Introduction: Jesper Söderlund not only put together a few interesting  scalability patterns , he also came up with a few interesting  scalability lessons :
  
  Lesson #1 . Put Smarty compile and template caches on an active-active DRBD cluster with high load and your servers will DIE! 
  Lesson #2 . Don't use out-of-the-box configurations. 
  Lesson #3 . Single points of contention will eventually become a bottleneck. 
  Lesson #4 . Plan in advance.  
  Lesson #5 . Offload your databases as much as possible. 
  Lesson #6 . File systems matter and can run out of space / inodes.

<p>Introduction: Hi,     I'm   i  nterested in peop  l  es thoughts on the best choice for a database clustering so  l  ution.     I have a database that is most  l  y varchars and numbers that doesn't store any b  i  nary data at a  l  l. It's used at about 70% read and 30% wr  i  tes - though we're using memcached at the moment so it's not rea  l  ly hit that hard.     We're current  l  y using mysql w  i  th m/cluster, but are interested in a new so  l  ution. Possib  l  e candidate so far are unic  l  uster (which doesn't seem mature yet.) or DRBD.     Had anyone had a simi  l  ar experience and can make any suggest  i  ons?     Thanks</p><p>5 0.67476964 <a title="718-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-30-NoCAP_%E2%80%93_Part_III_%E2%80%93_GigaSpaces_clustering_explained...html">950 high scalability-2010-11-30-NoCAP – Part III – GigaSpaces clustering explained..</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In many of the recent discussions on the design of large scale systems (a.k.a. Web Scale) it was argued that the right set of tradeoffs for building large scale systems would be to give away  C onsistency for  A vailability and  P artition tolerance. Those arguments relied on the foundation of the CAP theorem developed in early 2000-2002. One of the core principals behind the CAP theorem is that you must choose two out of the three CAP properties. In many of the transactional systems giving away consistency is either impossible or yields a huge complexity in the design of those systems. In this series of posts, I've tried to suggest a different set of tradeoffs in which we could achieve scalability without compromising on consistency. I also argued that rather than choosing only two out of the three CAP properties we could choose various degrees of all three. The degrees would be determined by the most likely availability and partition tolerance scenarios in our specific application.</p><p>6 0.67427874 <a title="718-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-28-PaaS_on_OpenStack_-_Run_Applications_on_Any_Cloud%2C_Any_Time_Using_Any_Thing.html">1031 high scalability-2011-04-28-PaaS on OpenStack - Run Applications on Any Cloud, Any Time Using Any Thing</a></p>

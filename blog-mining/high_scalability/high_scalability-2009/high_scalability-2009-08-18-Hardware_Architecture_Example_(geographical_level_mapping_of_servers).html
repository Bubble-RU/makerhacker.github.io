<p>Introduction: Update 3: ReadWriteWeb saysGoogle App Engine Announces New Pricing Plans,
APIs, Open Access. Pricing is specified but I'm not sure what to make of it
yet. An image manipulation library is added (thus the need to pay for more CPU
:-) and memcached support has been added. Memcached will help resolve the
can't write for every read problem that pops up when keeping counters.Update

atLoad test : Google App Engine = 1, Community = 0. GAE handled a peak of 35
requests/second and a sustained 10 requests/second. Some think performance was
good, others not so good. My GMT watch broke and I was late to arrive. Maybe
next time. Also added a few new design rules from the post.Update: Added a few

<p>Introduction: Good article frommanageability.com summarizing design patterns from Pat
Helland's amazing paperLife beyond Distributed Transactions: an Apostate's
Opinion.Entities are uniquely identified- each entity which represents
disjoint data (i.e. no overlap of data between entities) should have a unique
key.Multiple disjoint scopes of transactional serializability- in other words
there are these 'entities' and that you cannot perform atomic transactions
across these entities.At-Least-Once messaging- that is an application must
tolerate message retries and out-of-order arrival of messages.Messages are
adressed to entities- that is one can't abstract away from the business logic
the existence of the unique keys for addresing entities. Addressing however is
independent of location.Entities manage conversational state per party- that
is, to ensure idemptency an entity needs to remember that a message has been
previously processed. Furthermore, in a world without atomic transactions,

<p>Introduction: Hi,We are running a backup solution that uploads every night the files our
clients worked on during the day (Cabonite-like).We have currently about 10GB
of data per night, via http PUT requests (1 per file), and the files are
written as-is on a NAS.Our architecture is basically compound of a load
balancer (hardware, sticky sessions), 5 servers (Tomcat under RHEL4/5, ) and a
NAS (nfs 3).Since our number of clients is rising, (as is our system load) how
would you recommend we could scale our infrastructure? hardware and software?
Should we go towards NAS sharding, more servers, NIO on tomcat...?Thanks for
your inputs!</p><p>6 0.11599361 <a title="683-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-15-Video%3A_Dryad%3A_A_general-purpose_distributed_execution_platform.html">155 high scalability-2007-11-15-Video: Dryad: A general-purpose distributed execution platform</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi all,I'm a big fan of http://highscalability.com/ and have been looking in
my current development to decompose my application along functional boundaries
as a route to being able to scale out the server side, specifically the
database layer. The problem comes when there are links between the data in
different components, ie one component holds all the user data, but another
component needs to reference a user as being an owner of some piece of data.
I'm currently doing this by holding the primary key information for each side
of the the link (as you would if they all lived in a single database), but
this link table needs to exist in both components to allow lookups to be done
in either direction, ie 'get the things a specific user owns' and 'get the
owners of this specific thing' would each use different components. The
alternative to this would be to store the link data in only one of the
components, but then the reverse lookups would require 2 calls instead of just
one.My question</p><p>3 0.64284194 <a title="683-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-11-Sharding_and_Connection_Pools.html">532 high scalability-2009-03-11-Sharding and Connection Pools</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi we are looking at sharding our existing Java/Oracle based application. We
are looking to make the app servers able to process requests for multiple
(any?) shard. The concern that has come up is the amount of memory that would
be consumed by having so many connection pools on one app server. Additionally
there is concern about having so many physical connections to the database
server coming from all the various app servers that may talk to that
particular shard. I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this issue and
how you resolved it?Thanks,Scott</p><p>4 0.63029969 <a title="683-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-10-1_Master%2C_N_Slaves.html">178 high scalability-2007-12-10-1 Master, N Slaves</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Me and my partner are making a blueprint for an online webshop service. The
purpose of this project is to make webshops available for small company's/
individuals automatically just by creating an account with us. Our webapp can
be used to add products/pages/... to the store and we'll handle secure
checkout by paypal.Our app should be scalable and manageable. Because we also
want to offer free webshops, the amount of webshops could be +10.000 within a
few years. We are building on the Zend framework and are using mysql for
database.From the start we want to build our application for optimal and easy
scalability in the future, to avoid a lot changes to our app/database in the
future.Now our questions are:Should we use?:* one database for all shops (or
limited to X shops );* one database for each new shop (each having products,
orders... tables);I think both approaches have PRO/CONS. What do you think ?
Does anyone has experience with this kind of structure ?PRO:one database:

<p>Introduction: I have put down my thoughts in the architecture discussed inthe blog. Although
I have done substantial research to understand how things should work before
deciding this architecture but I will be requiring huge amount of inputs from
everyone to come to an architecture decision. Hardware entities which were
thought while designing the entities are:1. Master Web Server which will map
different users to web servers placed in different geographical locations.
(will prefer storing a mapping table in RAM)2. Web Servers3. Application
Servers4. Master Database Servers (to implement entity wise look up
sharding)5. Slave Database Servers.Will really appreciate if some good inputs
of using Cloud Computing are given and how to go about it against or in
addition to the given architecture. Would like to in fact know people's view
on when to decide using cloud computing techniques. Looking forward for inputs
from the community.</p><p>2 0.91945809 <a title="683-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-06-NoSQL_Pain%3F_Learn_How_to_Read-write_Scale_Without_a_Complete_Re-write.html">1054 high scalability-2011-06-06-NoSQL Pain?

<p>Introduction: Lately I've been reading more cases were different people have started to
realize the limitations of the NoSQL promise to database scalability. Note the
references below:Why does Quora use MySQL as the data store instead of NoSQLs
such as Cassandra, MongoDB, CouchDB etc?Why did Diaspora abandon MongoDB for
MySQL?How scalable is CouchDB in practice, not just in theory?Take MongoDB for
example. It's damn fast, but it doesn't really know how to save data reliably
to disk. I've had it set up in a replica pair to mitigate that risk. Guess
what - both servers in the pair failed and corrupted their data files at the
same day.It appears that for many, the switch to NoSQL can be rather painful.
IMO that doesn't necessarily mean that NoSQL is wrong in general, but it's a
combination of 1) lack of maturity 2) not the right tool for the job.That
brings the question of what's the alternative solution?In the following post I
tried to summarize the lessons from  Ronnie Bodinger (Head of IT at Avanza</p><p>3 0.90581328 <a title="683-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-07-What_CDN_would_you_recommend%3F.html">144 high scalability-2007-11-07-What CDN would you recommend?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi all, aI run a site that after a complete redesign have gotten a lot more
traffic. The site provides free flash games, so the biggest traffic share goes
to serving flash files (from about 100K and up to several megabytes in size
each.)I currently host the entire site on a hosting provider that have no
traffic limits. But since they are very cheap (yet have served me very well
all the time with at least 99,9% uptime), I don't trust them in allowing me to
continue consuming more and more bandwidth. I just guess I'm going to reach
some internal limit they have on day, so I'm looking into moving all the flash
content over to a content delivery network of some sort.Some recent traffic
stats:August: 12 GBSeptember: 22 GBOctober: 55 GBNovember: Currently 2,3 GB pr
day on average, but it's rising..I've been looking into Amazon S3, but have
not decided on anything yet. So therefor I'm asking if there are any other
provides I should consider, that operates within the same price range as

<p>Introduction: So far every massively scalable database is a bundle of compromises. For some
the weak guarantees of Amazon'seventual consistencymodel are too cold. For
many the strong guarantees of standard RDBMSdistributed transactionsare too
hot. Google App Engine tries to get it just right withentity groups. Yahoo! is
also trying to get is just right by offering per-record timeline consistency,
which hopes to serve up a heaping bowl ofrich database functionality and low
latency at massive scale:We describe PNUTS [Platform for Nimble Universal
Table Storage], a massively parallel and geographically distributed database
system for Yahoo!'s web applications. PNUTS provides data storage organized as
hashed or ordered tables, low latency for large numbers of con-current
requests including updates and queries, and novel per-record consistency
guarantees. It is a hosted, centrally managed, and geographically distributed
service, and utilizes automated load-balancing and failover to reduce

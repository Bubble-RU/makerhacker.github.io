<p>Introduction: Update: Erlang at Facebook by Eugene Letuchy. How Facebook uses Erlang to
implement Chat, AIM Presence, and Chat Jabber support. I've done
someXMPPdevelopment so when I readFacebook was making a Jabber chat clientI
was really curious how they would make it work. While core XMPP is
straightforward, a number of protocol extensions like discovery, forms, chat
states, pubsub, multi user chat, and privacy lists really up the
implementation complexity. Some real engineering challenges were involved to
make this puppy scale and perform. It's not clear what extensions they've
implemented, but a blog entry by Facebook's Eugene Letuchy hits some of the
architectural challenges they faced and how they overcame them.A web based
Jabber client poses a few problems because XMPP, like most IM protocols, is an
asynchronous event driven system that pretty much assumes you have a full time
open connection. After logging in the server sends a client roster information
and presence information. Your client</p><p>4 0.10629186 <a title="501-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-22-Server_load_balancing_architectures%2C_Part_2%3A_Application-level_load_balancing.html">427 high scalability-2008-10-22-Server load balancing architectures, Part 2: Application-level load balancing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The transport-level server load balancing architectures described inthe first
half of this articleare more than adequate for many Web sites, but more
complex and dynamic sites can't depend on them. Applications that rely on
cache or session data must be able to handle a sequence of requests from the
same client accurately and efficiently, without failing. In this follow up to
his introduction to server load balancing, Gregor Roth discusses various
application-level load balancing architectures, helping you decide which one
will best meet the business requirements of your Web site.The first half of
this articledescribes transport-level server load balancing solutions, such as
TCP/IP-based load balancers, and analyzes their benefits and disadvantages.
Load balancing on the TCP/IP level spreads incoming TCP connections over the
real servers in a server farm. It is sufficient in most cases, especially for
static Web sites. However, support for dynamic Web sites often requires

<p>Introduction: One of the premier scaling strategies is always: get someone else to do the
work for you. But unlike Huckleberry Finn inTom Sawyer, you won't have to
trick anyone into whitewashing a fence for you. Times have changed. Companies
likeNing,Facebook, andSalesforceare more than happy to help. Their price:
lock-in.Previously you had few options when building a "real" website. You
needed to do everything yourself. Infrastructure and application were all
yours. Then companies stepped in by commoditizing parts of the infrastructure,
but the application was still yours. The next step is full on Borg take no
prisoners assimilation where the infrastructure and application are built as
one collective. What you have to decide as someone faced with building a
scalable website is if these new options are worth the price.Feeding this
explosion of choice is one of the new strategy games on the intertubes: the
Internet Platform Game. Ning's Marc Andreessen defines aplatformas:a system

<p>Introduction: There's some amount of debate whether Facebookreallycrossed over the one
trillion page view per month threshold. While one report says it did,another
respected firm says it did not; that its monthly page views are a mere 467
billion per month.In the big scheme of things, the discrepancy is somewhat
irrelevant, as neither show thetrueload on Facebook's infrastructure - which
is far more impressive a set of numbers than its externally measured "page
view" metric.  Mashable reported in "Facebook Surpasses 1 Trillion Pageviews
per Month" that the social networking giant saw "approximately 870 million
unique visitors in June and 860 million in July" and followed up with some per
visitor statistics, indicating "each visitor averaged approximately 1,160 page
views in July and 40 per visit -- enormous by any standard. Time spent on the
site was around 25 minutes per user."From an architectural standpoint it's
notjustabout the page views. It's about requests and responses, many of which

<p>Introduction: Aditya Agarwal, Director of Engineering at Facebook, gave an excellent Scale
at Facebooktalk that covers their architecture, but the talk is really more
about how to scale an organization by preserving the best parts of its
culture. The key take home of the talk is: You can get the code right, you can
get the products right, but you need to get the culture right first. If you
don't get the culture right then your company won't scale.This leads into the
four meta secrets of scaling at Facebook:Scaling takes IterationDon't Over

<p>Introduction: Hello,I'm developing a product I thought of.As a part of it, I'm trying to
figure out the best architecture for the product.It's a server application,
what is supposed to serve A LOT of users at a time.Think of an IM application,
but not web style, more like ICQ\MSN applications... With web orientation.I've
read all about Meebo, Facebook Chat & etc architectures.But I'm still not sure
where to start on ICQ style (this is the first phase before I go totally
web).Can you direct me to some information on load balancing 10 million users?
;-)I just don't know here to begin...Thanks,Amit</p><p>2 0.86839855 <a title="501-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-19-Conference%3A_Infoscale_2008_in_Italy_%28June_4-6%29.html">322 high scalability-2008-05-19-Conference: Infoscale 2008 in Italy (June 4-6)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Third International Conference on Scalable Information Systems will focus
on a wide array of scalability issues and investigate new approaches to tackle
problems arising from the ever-growing size and complexity of information of
all kinds.Looking at theirtechnical programa lot of interesting topics will be
covered. I see sensor networks, a subject I'm really interested in, has a
number of sessions. That's unusual. And it's in Italy!</p><p>3 0.86698616 <a title="501-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-11-FTP_Sanity%3A_Redundancy%2C_archiving%2C_consolidation..html">208 high scalability-2008-01-11-FTP Sanity: Redundancy, archiving, consolidation.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I’ve been a part of some late night release procedures and they’re never fun.
You’ve got QA, Dev, IT and a handful of managers sitting in their jammies in a
group IM (or worse, a conference call) from 2:00 AM until way too early in the
morning. Everyone’s grumpy and sleepy, causing the release to be more
difficult and take longer. Sometimes the dreaded “rollback!” is yelled. All
this because you’re running a high profile website that needs to be accessible
24/7, and 2:00 AM - 5:00 AM downtime is better than daytime downtime.If you're
a site that doesn't have 10s of thousands to drop on a real http load
balancer, use this strategy to release software during business hours with no
downtime using apache's mod_proxy_balancer....</p><p>5 0.85989147 <a title="501-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-28-NoSQL_Took_Away_the_Relational_Model_and_Gave_Nothing_Back.html">930 high scalability-2010-10-28-NoSQL Took Away the Relational Model and Gave Nothing Back</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: Benjamin Black said he was the source of the quote and also said I was
wrong about what he meant. His real point:The meaning of the statement was
that NoSQL systems (really the various map-reduce systems) are lacking a
standard model for describing and querying and that developing one should be a
high priority task for them.At the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto, an audience
member, sorry, I couldn't tell who, said something I found really
interesting:NoSQL took away the relational model and gave nothing back.The
idea being that NoSQL has focussed on ease of use, scalability, performance,
etc, but it has lost the idea of how data relates to other data. True to its
name, the relational model is very good at capturing a managing relationships.
With NoSQL all relationships have been pushed back onto the poor programmer to
implement in code rather than the database managing it. We've sacrificed
usability. NoSQL is about concurrency, latency, and scalability, but it's not
about data.My</p><p>6 0.85913324 <a title="501-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-08-1dbase_vs._many_and_cloud_hosting_vs._dedicated_server%28s%29%3F.html">675 high scalability-2009-08-08-1dbase vs. many and cloud hosting vs. dedicated server(s)?</a></p>

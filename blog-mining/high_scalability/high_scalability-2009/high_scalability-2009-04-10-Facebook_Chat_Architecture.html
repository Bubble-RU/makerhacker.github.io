Java, but in a very pragmatic way. They use servlets, an application server,
the JDK, and they do the rest themselves. They skip JSP, entity beans, and
JMS.When you need to scale putting all your eggs in one basket is a risky
strategy. Why use JSP when you can do better? When use entity beans when you
can do better? Use servlets because they are a very effective way of handling
http requests. Use Java because it is fast, runs everywhere, and has a boat
load of libraries you can use to build your build your custom system.Probably
the major reason J2EE is absentee is simply LAMP. LAMP is just so incredibly
functional for most 2-tier shared nothing sites they don't need a better

<p>Introduction: Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of Technology at Facebook gave a great
presentation at UC San Diego on our favorite subject: "High Performance at
Massive Scale -  Lessons learned at Facebook". The abstract for the talk
is:Facebook has grown into one of the largest sites on the Internet today
serving over 200 billion pages per month. The nature of social data makes
engineering a site for this level of scale a particularly challenging
proposition. In this presentation, I will discuss the aspects of social data
that present challenges for scalability and will describe the the core
architectural components and design principles that Facebook has used to
address these challenges. In addition, I will discuss emerging technologies
that offer new opportunities for building cost-effective high performance web
architectures.There's a lot of interesting about this talk that we'll get into
later, but I thought you might want a head start on learning how Facebook
handles 30K+ machines, 300 million</p><p>3 0.72996813 <a title="563-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-22-Exploring_the_software_behind_Facebook%2C_the_world%E2%80%99s_largest_site.html">845 high scalability-2010-06-22-Exploring the software behind Facebook, the world’s largest site</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In the past year, Intel issued a series of powerful chips under the new
Nehalem microarchitecture, with large numbers of cores and extensive memory
capacity. This new class of chips is is part of a bigger Intel initiative
referred to as Tera-Scale Computing. Cisco has released their Unified
Computing System (UCS) equipped with a unique extended memory and high speed
network within the box, which is specifically geared to take advantage of this
type of CPU architecture .This new class of hardware has the potential to
revolutionize the IT landscape as we know it.In  this post, I want to focus
primarily on the potential implications on application architecture, more
specifically on the application platform landscape.  more...</p><p>5 0.44962284 <a title="563-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-05-Scalability_Perspectives_%234%3A_Kevin_Kelly_%E2%80%93_One_Machine.html">460 high scalability-2008-12-05-Scalability Perspectives #4: Kevin Kelly – One Machine</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectivesis a series of posts that highlights the ideas that
will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires
an open mind. Warning #2: this post is wild.Kevin KellyKevin Kelly is Senior
Maverick at Wired magazine. He helped launch Wired in 1993, and served as its
Executive Editor until January 1999. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers'
Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online
service started in 1985. He authored the best-sellingNew Rules for the New
Economyand the classic book on decentralized emergent systems,Out of

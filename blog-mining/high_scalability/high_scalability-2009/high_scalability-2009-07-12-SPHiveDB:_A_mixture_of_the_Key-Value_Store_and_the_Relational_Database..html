  Or, you could just avoid the OS altogether:  https://github.com/SnabbCo/snabbswitch    

Our current engineering target is 1 million writes/sec and > 10 million reads/sec on top of an architecture similar to that, on a single box, to our fully transactional, MVCC database (write do not block reads, and vice versa) that runs in the same process (a la SQLite), which we've also merged with our application code and our caching tier, so we're down to—literally—a single process for what would have been at least three separate tiers in a traditional setup.


The result is that we had to move to measuring request latency in microseconds exclusively.

Data storage has always been one of the most difficult problems to address, especially as the quantity of stored data is constantly increasing. This is not simply due to the growing numbers of people regularly using the Internet, particularly with all the social networks, games and gizmos now available. Companies are also amassing more and more meticulous information relevant to their business, in order to optimize productivity and ROI (Return On Investment). I find the positioning of SQL and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) as opposites rather a shame: it’s true that the marketing wave of NoSQL has enabled the renewed promotion of a system that’s been around for quite a while, but which was only rarely considered in most cases, as after all, everything could be fitted into the « good old SQL model ».

<p>Introduction: The abstract for the talk given by Bob Ippolito, co-founder and CTO of Mochi Media, Inc:
   Building large systems on top of a traditional single-master RDBMS data storage layer is no longer good enough. This talk explores the landscape of new technologies available today to augment your data layer to improve performance and reliability. Is your application a good fit for caches, bloom filters, bitmap indexes, column stores, distributed key/value stores, or document databases? Learn how they work (in theory and practice) and decide for yourself.   
Bob does an excellent job highlighting different products and the key concepts to understand when pondering the wide variety of new database offerings. It's unlikely you'll be able to say oh, this is the database for me after watching the presentation, but you will be much better informed on your options. And I imagine slightly confused as to what to do :-)  An interesting observation in the talk is that the more robust products are internal</p><p>5 0.093020894 <a title="655-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-26-ThemBid_Architecture.html">33 high scalability-2007-07-26-ThemBid Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: ThemBid provides a market where people needing work done broadcast their request and accept bids from people competing for the job. Unlike many of the sites profiled at HighScalability, ThemBid is not in the popular press as often as Paris Hilton. It's not a media darling or a giant of the industry. But what I like is they have a strategy, a point-of-view for building websites and were gracious enough to share very detailed instructions on how to go about building a website. They even delve into actual installation details of the various software packages they use.  Anyone can benefit by taking a look at their work.

<p>Introduction: With so many database options available these days, like for the rest of life, it's natural to wonder how it all  fits together . Amazon complicated, or rather expanded the available options by introducing RDS, their  relational database service . RDS is MySQL safely cocooned as a manageable cloud element, resting boldly within an energy providing elastic  CPU pool , supported by a virtually  infinite supply  of very  capable virtualized storage  .
 
MySQL in AWS is  now easy  to start, stop, monitor, backup, snapshot, expand, and effortlessly move up and down the instance hierarchy. What it's not, contrary to what you might expect, is a scale-out solution, it's a scale-up solution. You get more by buying a bigger instance, not by horizontally adding more instances. There's a  limit . Admittedly a larger limit now with Amazon's new  high memory instances .
 
That's OK, well maybe not for people who helped grow Amazon's ecosystem by offering a similar product, but so many projects use M</p><p>4 0.70614046 <a title="655-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-05-A_Yes_for_a_NoSQL_Taxonomy.html">737 high scalability-2009-11-05-A Yes for a NoSQL Taxonomy</a></p>

 memcached, repcached, coherence, infinispan, eXtreme scale, jboss cache, velocity, terracoqa 
 
 
  key‐value‐store    
 
 keyspace, flare, schema‐free, RAMCloud 
 
 
 eventually‐consistent key‐value‐store    
 
 dynamo, voldemort, Dynomite, SubRecord, Mo8onDb, Dovetaildb 
 
 
 ordered‐key‐value‐store    
 
 tokyo tyrant, lightcloud, NMDB, luxio, memcachedb, actord 
 
 
 data‐structures server

<p>Introduction: We've asked  What The Heck Are You Actually Using NoSQL For? . We've asked  101 Questions To Ask When Considering A NoSQL Database . We've even had a  webinar   What Should I Do? Choosing SQL, NoSQL or Both for Scalable Web Applications .
 
Now we get to the point of considering use cases and which systems might be appropriate for those use cases.
  What are your options?  
First, let's cover what are the various data models. These have been adapted from  Emil Eifrem  and  NoSQL databases . 
 
 Document Databases 
  
 Lineage: Inspired by Lotus Notes. 
 Data model: Collections of documents, which contain key-value collections. 
 Example: CouchDB, MongoDB  
 Good at: Natural data modeling. Programmer friendly. Rapid development. Web friendly, CRUD. 
             Graph Databases    
 
 Lineage: Euler and graph theory. 
 Data model: Nodes & relationships, both which can hold key-value pairs 
 Example: AllegroGraph, InfoGrid, Neo4j 
 Good at:  Rock complicated graph problems. Fast.</p><p>6 0.63702089 <a title="655-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-09-NoSQL_on_the_Microsoft_Platform.html">875 high scalability-2010-08-09-NoSQL on the Microsoft Platform</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Database normalization is a technique for designing relational database schemas that ensures that the data is optimal for ad-hoc querying and that modifications such as deletion or insertion of data does not lead to data inconsistency. Database denormalization is the process of optimizing your database for reads by creating redundant data. A consequence of denormalization is that insertions or deletions could cause data inconsistency if not uniformly applied to all redundant copies of the data within the database.

<p>Introduction: Update:   Good Vibrations  by Radovan Semančík. Lot's of interesting questions about how Wave works, scalability, security, RESTyness, and so on.   Google Wave  is a new communication and collaboration platform based on hosted XML documents (called waves) supporting concurrent modifications and low-latency updates. This platform enables people to communicate and work together in new, convenient and effective ways. We will offer these benefits to users of  Google Wave  and we also want to share them with everyone else by making waves an open platform that everybody can share. We welcome others to run wave servers and become wave providers, for themselves or as services for their users, and to "federate" waves, that is, to share waves with each other and with Google Wave. In this way users from different wave providers can communicate and collaborate using shared waves. We are introducing the Google Wave Federation Protocol for federating waves between wave providers on the Internet.

<p>Introduction: In his blog post,  Scaling WSO2 Stratos , Srinath Perera explains the scaling architecture of the WSO2 Stratos Platform as a Service (PaaS) infrastructure. It is explained as a series of solutions where every solution adds a new concept to solve a specific problem found in the earlier solution.
 
Overall, WSO2 Stratos uses a combination of intelligent Load balancing and lazy loading to scale up the architecture. More details about Stratos can be found from the paper     WSO2 Stratos: An Industrial Stack to Support Cloud Computing .   
  Problem  
 Stratos is   multi-tenanted  . In other words, there are many tenants. Each tenant generally represents an organization and isolated from other tenants, where each tenant has his own users, resources, and permissions. Stratos supports multiple PaaS services. Each PaaS service is actually a WSO2 Products (e.g. AS, BPS, ESB etc.) offered as a service. Using those services, tenants may deploy their own Web Services, Mediation logic, Workflows, a</p><p>same-blog 5 0.77142239 <a title="655-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-12-SPHiveDB%3A_A_mixture_of_the_Key-Value_Store_and_the_Relational_Database..html">655 high scalability-2009-07-12-SPHiveDB: A mixture of the Key-Value Store and the Relational Database.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Key/Value Store becames more and more popular. When we use the Key/Value Store to store objects, we need to serialize/deserialize the objects as binary buffer. We have many ways to serialize/deserialize objects. A possible way is to use the Relational Database. Every value we store in the Key/Value Store is a SQLite instance. We can use the power of the Relational Database to manipulate the value. The SQL is very powerful for processing query request.   SPHiveDB = TokyoCabinet + SQLite http://code.google.com/p/sphivedb/  SPHiveDB is a server for sqlite database. It use JSON-RPC over HTTP to expose a network interface to use SQLite database. It supports combining multiple SQLite databases into one file ( through tokyo cabinet ). It also supports the use of multiple files.</p><p>6 0.70096612 <a title="655-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-16-S3_Failed_Because_of_Authentication_Overload.html">249 high scalability-2008-02-16-S3 Failed Because of Authentication Overload</a></p>

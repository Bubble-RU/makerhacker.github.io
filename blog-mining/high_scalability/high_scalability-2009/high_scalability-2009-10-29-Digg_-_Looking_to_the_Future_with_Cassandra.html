<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byDoug Judd, original creator of Hypertable and the CEO
of Hypertable, Inc.Hypertable delivers 2X better throughput in most tests --
HBase fails 41 and 167 billion record insert tests, overwhelmed by garbage
collection -- Both systems deliver similar results for random read uniform
testWe recently conducted a test comparing the performance of Hypertable
(@hypertable) version 0.9.5.5 to that of HBase (@HBase) version 0.90.4
(CDH3u2) running Zookeeper 3.3.4.  In this post, we summarize the results and
offer explanations for the discrepancies. For the full test report,
seeHypertable vs. HBase II.IntroductionHypertable and HBase are both open
source, scalable databases modeled after Google's proprietary Bigtable
database.  The primary difference between the two systems is that Hypertable
is written in C++, while HBase is written in Java.  We modeled this test after
the one described in section 7 of theBigtable paperand tuned both systems for
maximum performance.  The t</p><p>3 0.12861867 <a title="732-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-05-Anti-RDBMS%3A_A_list_of_distributed_key-value_stores.html">670 high scalability-2009-08-05-Anti-RDBMS: A list of distributed key-value stores</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Christof Strauch, from Stuttgart Media University, has written an incredible
120+ page paper titledNoSQL Databases as an introduction and overview to NoSQL
databases . The paper was written between 2010-06 and 2011-02, so it may be a
bit out of date, but if you are looking to take in the NoSQL world in one big
gulp, this is your chance. I asked Christof to give us a  short taste of what
he was trying to accomplish in his paper:The paper aims at giving a systematic
and thorough introduction and overview of the NoSQL field by assembling
information dispersed among blogs, wikis and scientific papers. It firstly
discusses reasons, rationales and motives for the development and usage of
nonrelational database systems. These can be summarized by the need for high
scalability, the processing of large amounts of data, the ability to
distribute data among many (often commodity) servers, consequently a
distribution-aware design of DBMSs.The paper then introduces fundamental
concepts, techniques</p><p>4 0.69804132 <a title="732-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-09-NoSQL_on_the_Microsoft_Platform.html">875 high scalability-2010-08-09-NoSQL on the Microsoft Platform</a></p>
<p>Introduction: NoSQL is a trend that is gaining steam primarily in the world of Open Source.
There are numerous NoSQL solutions available for all levels of complexity:
from queryable distributed solutions like MongoDB to simpler distributed key-
value storage solutions like Cassandra. Then there's Riak, Tokyo Cabinet,
Voldemort, CouchDB, and Redis. However, very few of these packaged NoSQL
products are available for the other end of the platform market: Microsoft
Windows. I'm going to outline what's available now and briefly touch on some
opportunities that are still available to the daring Microsoft engineer.You

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post bySiddharth Anand, a senior member of LinkedIn's
Distributed Data Systems team. Preamble RambleIf you've been working in the
online (e.g. internet) space over the past 3 years, you are no stranger to
terms like "the cloud" and "NoSQL".In 2007, Amazon published a paper onDynamo.
The paper detailed how Dynamo, employing a collection of techniques to solve
several problems in fault-tolerance, provided a resilient solution to the on-
line shopping cart problem. A few years go by while engineers at AWS toil in
relative obscurity at standing up their public cloud.It's December 2008 and I
am a member of Netflix's Software Infrastructure team. We've just been told
that there is something called the "CAP theorem" and because of it, we are to
abandon our datacenter in hopes of leveraging Cloud Computing.Huh?A month into
the investigation, we start wondering about our Oracle database. How are we
are going to move it into the cloud? That's when we are told that we are to

<p>Introduction: Digg has been researching ways to scale our database infrastructure for some
time now. We've adopted a traditional vertically partitioned master-slave
configuration with MySQL, and also investigated sharding MySQL with IDDB.
Ultimately, these solutions left us wanting. In the case of the traditional
architecture, the lack of redundancy on the write masters is painful, and both
approaches have significant management overhead to keep running.Since it was
already necessary to abandon data normalization and consistency to make these
approaches work, we felt comfortable looking at more exotic, non-relational
data stores. After considering HBase, Hypertable, Cassandra, Tokyo
Cabinet/Tyrant, Voldemort, and Dynomite, we settled on Cassandra.Each system
has its own strengths and weaknesses, but Cassandra has a good blend of
everything. It offers column-oriented data storage, so you have a bit more
structure than plain key/value stores. It operates in a distributed, highly
available, peer-to-pee</p><p>4 0.802109 <a title="732-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-16-Seven_Signs_You_May_Need_a_NoSQL_Database.html">779 high scalability-2010-02-16-Seven Signs You May Need a NoSQL Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: While exploring deep into some dusty old library stacks, I dug up Nostradamus'
long lostNoSQLcodex. What are the chances? Strangely, it also gave the plot to
the next Dan Brown novel, but I left that out for reasons of sanity. About
NoSQL, here is what Nosty (his friends call him Nosty) predicted are the signs
you may need a NoSQL database...You noticed a lot of your database fields are
really serialized complex objects in disguise. Why bother with a RDBMS at all
then? Storing serialized objects in a relational database is like being on the
pill while trying to get pregnant, a bit counter productive. Just use a
schemaless database from the start.Using a standard query language has become
too confining. You just want to be free. SQL is so easy, so convenient, and so
standard, it's reallynot a challengeanymore. You need to be different. Then
NoSQL is for you. Each has their own completely differentquery mechanism.Your
toolbox only contains a hammer. Hammers while wonderfully versatile, c</p><p>5 0.74238956 <a title="732-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-17-What_is_the_best_hosting_option%3F.html">67 high scalability-2007-08-17-What is the best hosting option?</a></p>

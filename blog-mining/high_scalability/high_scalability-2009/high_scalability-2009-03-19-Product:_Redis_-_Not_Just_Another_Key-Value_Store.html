</p><p>4 The home page is well organized so I'll spare the excessive-copying-to-make-this-post-longer. [sent-6, score-0.124]
</p><p>5 If you are looking at a way to understand how Redis is different than something like Tokyo Cabinet/Tyrant,  Ezra Zygmuntowicz  has done a good job explaining their different niches:     Â     Redis has a different use case then tokyo does. [sent-8, score-0.394]
</p><p>6 I think tokyo is better for long term persistent data storage. [sent-9, score-0.486]
</p><p>7 But redis is much better as a state/data structure server. [sent-10, score-0.395]
</p><p>8 Redis is faster then tokyo by quite a bit but is not immediately durable as in the writes to disk happen in the background at certain trigger points so it is possible to lose a little bit of data if the server crashes. [sent-11, score-0.729]
</p><p>9 Having LISTS and SETS as well as string values for keys means you can do O(1) push/pop/shift/unshift as well as indexing/slicing into lists. [sent-13, score-0.282]
</p><p>10 And with the SET data type you can do set intersection in the server. [sent-14, score-0.421]
</p><p>11 This allows for very cool thigs like storing a set of tags for each key and then querying for the intersection of the set of tags of multiple keys to find out the common set of tags. [sent-15, score-1.088]
</p><p>12 I'm using this in nanite(an agent based messaging system) for the persistent storage of agent state and routing info. [sent-16, score-0.414]
</p><p>13 Using the SET data types makes this faster then keeping the state in memory in my ruby processes since can do the SEt intersection routing inside of redis rather then iterating and comparing in ruby: http://gist. [sent-17, score-0.948]
</p><p>14 You can also use redis LISTS as a queue to distribute work between multiple processes. [sent-20, score-0.395]
</p><p>15 Since pushing and popping are atomic you can use it as a shared tuple space. [sent-21, score-0.479]
</p><p>16 Also you can use a LIST as a circular log buffer by pushing to the end of a list and then doing an LTRIM to trim the list to the max size: redis. [sent-22, score-1.044]
</p><p>17 That will keep your circular log buffer at a max of 100 items. [sent-27, score-0.501]
</p><p>18 With tokyo you can store lists if you use lua on the server, but to push or pop from a list you have to pull the entire list down, alter it and then push it back up to the server. [sent-28, score-1.35]
</p><p>19 There is no atomic push/pop of just a single item because tokyo cannot store real lists as values so you have to do marshaling of your list to/from a string. [sent-29, score-1.228]
</p><p>20 A demo application called  Retwis  shows how to use Redis to make a scalable Twitter clone, at least of the message posting aspects. [sent-30, score-0.128]

Common Redis primitives like LPUSH, and LTRIM, and LREM are used to accomplish tasks programmers need to get done, but that can be hard or slow in more traditional stores. A very useful and practical article. How would you accomplish these tasks in your framework?
  
  Show latest items listings in your home page . This is a live in-memory cache and is very fast.  LPUSH  is used to insert a content ID at the head of the list stored at a key.  LTRIM  is used to limit the number of items in the list to 5000. If the user needs to page beyond this cache only then are they sent to the database. 
  Deletion and filtering . If a cached article is deleted it can be removed from the cache using  LREM .

<p>Introduction: Update : Here's the  video of the talk .
 
  Erick Pickup  , lead developer at YouPorn.com, presented their architecture in a talk titled   Building a Website To Scale   given at the   ConFoo   conference.  As you might expect, YouPorn is a beast, streaming three full DVDs of video every second, handing 300K queries every second, and generating up to 15GBs of log data per hour.  Unfortunately, all we have are the slides of the talk, so this article isn’t as technical as I might like, there’s no visibility at all on the video handling for example, but we do get some interesting details.  The most interesting takeway is that YouPorn is a pretty conventional LAMP stack, with a NoSQL twist as Redis now replaces MySQL in the live datapath. Reminds me a little of   YouTube   in its simplicity.   The second most interesting takeaway was the  great switchover . Common wisdom says never rewrite, but in 2011 YouPorn rewrote their entire site to use PHP + Redis instead of a complex Perl + MySQL b</p><p>4 0.20621558 <a title="545-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-16-A_Super_Short_on_the_Youporn_Stack_-_300K_QPS_and_100_Million_Page_Views_Per_Day.html">1194 high scalability-2012-02-16-A Super Short on the Youporn Stack - 300K QPS and 100 Million Page Views Per Day</a></p>

 Most data is found in hashes with ordered sets used to know what data to show.   
 
 A typical lookup would be an zInterStore on: videos:filters:released, Videos:filters:orientation:straight,Videos:filters:categories:{category_id}, Videos:ordering:rating

<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.    We're basically using a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget). Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text, author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.    I'm wondering if we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to g</p><p>4 0.707138 <a title="545-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-16-A_Super_Short_on_the_Youporn_Stack_-_300K_QPS_and_100_Million_Page_Views_Per_Day.html">1194 high scalability-2012-02-16-A Super Short on the Youporn Stack - 300K QPS and 100 Million Page Views Per Day</a></p>

 Most data is found in hashes with ordered sets used to know what data to show.   
 
 A typical lookup would be an zInterStore on: videos:filters:released, Videos:filters:orientation:straight,Videos:filters:categories:{category_id}, Videos:ordering:rating 
 Then perform a zRange to get the pages we want and get the list of video_ids back.  
 Then start a pipeline and get</p><p>5 0.6890502 <a title="545-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-28-Design_Decisions_for_Scaling_Your_High_Traffic_Feeds.html">1538 high scalability-2013-10-28-Design Decisions for Scaling Your High Traffic Feeds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Guest post by Thierry Schellenbach, Founder/CTO of Fashiolista.com, follow @tschellenbach on Twitter and Github 
 
 Fashiolista  started out as a hobby project which we built on the side. We had absolutely no idea it would grow into one of the largest online fashion communities. The entire first version took about two weeks to develop and our feed implementation was dead simple. We’ve come a long way since then and I’d like to share our experience with scaling feed systems.
 
Feeds are a core component of many large startups such as Pinterest, Instagram, Wanelo and Fashiolista. At Fashiolista the feed system powers the  flat feed ,  aggregated feed  and the  notification  system. This article will explain the troubles we ran into when scaling our feeds and the design decisions involved with building your own solution. Understanding the basics of how these feed systems work is essential as more and more applications rely on them.
  
 Furthermore we’ve open sourced  Feedly , the Python m</p><p>6 0.68571794 <a title="545-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-15-Simpler%2C_Cheaper%2C_Faster%3A_Playtomic%27s_Move_from_.NET_to_Node_and_Heroku.html">1340 high scalability-2012-10-15-Simpler, Cheaper, Faster: Playtomic's Move from .NET to Node and Heroku</a></p>

<p>Introduction: With the introduction of  Redis  your options in the key-value space just grew and your choice of which to pick just got a lot harder. But when you think about it, that's not a bad position to be in at all.  Redis (REmote DIctionary Server) -  a key-value database. It's similar to memcached but the dataset is not volatile, and values can be strings, exactly like in memcached, but also lists and sets with atomic operations to push/pop elements.   The key points are: open source; speed (benchmarked performing 110,000 SET operations, and 81,000 GETs, per second); persistence, but in an asynchronous way taking everything in memory; support for higher level data structures and atomic operations.  The home page is well organized so I'll spare the excessive-copying-to-make-this-post-longer. For a good overview of Redis take a look at Antonio Cangiano's article:  Introducing Redis: a fast key-value database .  If you are looking at a way to understand how Redis is different than something like</p><p>2 0.92713439 <a title="545-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-22-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_22%2C_2011.html">1084 high scalability-2011-07-22-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 22, 2011</a></p>

 Potent quotables:      
 
  @merv  - Does elastic scalability matter? Ask Apple about 1 million e-transactions in a day. $30M worth of multi-gig downloads that must work. 
  @lmacvittie  - Cloud has shifted the focus of scalability from applications to architecture. 
  @bartbohn  - Love the phrase "anarchic scalability" by Roy Fielding 
  @iAjayMe  - Programming: I have come to the conclusion, if you want to do something right the first time (scalability,performance) write it in C++ 
  @mreferre  - Interesting discussion between @jamesurquhart and @lmacvittie about PaaS/App scalability (I think). Need google translator though...

<p>Introduction: Over the years I've read a lot of research papers looking for better ways of doing things. Sometimes I find ideas I can use, but more often than not I come up empty. The problem is there are very few good papers. And by good I mean: can a reasonably intelligent person read a paper and turn it into something useful? 
 
Now, clearly I'm not an academic and clearly I'm no genius, I'm just an everyday programmer searching for leverage, and as a common specimen of the species I've often thought how much better our industry would be if we could simply move research from academia into production with some sort of self-conscious professionalism. Currently the process is horribly hit or miss. And this problem extends equally to companies with research divisions that often do very little to help front-line developers succeed. 
 
How many ideas break out of academia into industry in computer science? We have many brilliant examples: encryption, microprocessors, compression, transactions, distribu</p><p>4 0.92599833 <a title="545-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-13-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_13%2C_2012.html">1174 high scalability-2012-01-13-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 13, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: "I'll never need to scale so why bother? We aren't Twitter or Facebook or Google after all." This is the most common email I get, a question in the form of a thinly disguised rationalization for not having to worry about scaling. And in these days of giant transformer-like machines they are probably right. But what if there are  Barry Bonds  enhancing type forces at work that argue for the chances of your needing to scale being higher than you think?
 
And if that happens, how will you cross the scalability chasm? Will you want to completely change your architecture or evolve it from a tool-chain that was meant to scale from the start? Architecturally, that's the question you have to answer. Today's tool-chains are making it possible to grow a system from small to large without needing to implement complete architectural phase changes at various scale inflection points, but that's a different topic. We're trying to think about why you may actually need to scale, that is the question.</p><p>6 0.9164263 <a title="545-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-04-Manage_Downtime_Risk_by_Connecting_Multiple_Data_Centers_into_a_Secure_Virtual_LAN.html">266 high scalability-2008-03-04-Manage Downtime Risk by Connecting Multiple Data Centers into a Secure Virtual LAN</a></p>

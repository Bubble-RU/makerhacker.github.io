<p>Introduction: The High Scalable Systems (i.e. Websites) such as: Google, Facebook, Amazon,
etc. need high scalable storage system that can deal with huge amount of data
with high availability and reliability. Building large systems on top of a
traditional RDBMS data storage layer is no longer good enough. This
presentation explores the landscape of new technologies available today to
augment your data layer to improve performance and reliability.Remember: All

<p>Introduction: The Future of the Parallelism and its ChallengesResearch and education in
Parallel computing technologies is more important than ever. Here I present a
perspective on the past contributions, current status, and future direction of
the parallelism technologies.While machine power will grow impressively,
increased parallelism, rather than clock rate, will be driving force in
computing in the foreseeable future. This ongoing shift toward parallel
architectural paradigms is one of the greatest challenges for the
microprocessor and software industries. In 2005, Justin Ratter, chief
technology officer of Intel Corporation, said ‘We are at the cusp of a
transition to multicore, multithreaded architectures, and we still have not
demonstrated the ease of programming the move will require…’Key points:A

<p>Introduction: The recent Data-Intensive Computing Symposium brought together experts in
system design, programming, parallel algorithms, data management, scientific
applications, and information-based applications to better understand existing
capabilities in the development and application of large-scale computing
systems, and to explore future opportunities.Google Fellow Jeff Dean had a
very interesting presentation on Handling Large Datasets at Google: Current
Systems and Future Directions. He discussed:• Hardware infrastructure•
Distributed systems infrastructure:–Scheduling system–GFS–BigTable–MapReduce•
Challenges and Future Directions–Infrastructure that spans all
datacenters–More automationIt is really like a "How does Google work"

<p>Introduction: Art of DistributedPart 1: Rethinking about distributed computing modelsI 'm
getting a lot of questions lately about the distributed computing, especially
distributed computing model, and MapReduce, such as: What is MapReduce? Can
MapReduce fit in all situations? How we can compares it with other
technologies such as Grid Computing? And what is the best solution to our
situation? So I decide to write about the distributed computing article in two
parts. First one about the distributed computing model and what is the
difference between them. In the second part I will discuss the reliability,
and distributed storage systems.Download the article in PDF format.Download
the article in MS Word format.I wait for your comments, and questions, and I
will answer it in part two.</p><p>5 0.61612207 <a title="652-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-30-Behind_the_scenes_of_an_online_marketplace.html">818 high scalability-2010-04-30-Behind the scenes of an online marketplace</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post written byClaude Johnson, a Lead Site Reliability
Engineer atsalesforce.com.The following is an architectural overview of
salesforce.com's core platform and applications. Other systems such as
Heroku's Dyno architecture or the subsystems of other products such as
work.com and do.com are specifically not covered by this material, although
database.com is. The idea is to share with the technology community some
insight about how salesforce.com does what it does. Any mistakes or omissions
are mine.This is by no means comprehensive but if there is interest, the
author would be happy to tackle other areas of how salesforce.com works.
Salesforce.com is interested in being more open with the technology
communities that we have not previously interacted with. Here's to the start
of "Opening the Kimono" about how we work.Since 1999, salesforce.com has been
singularly focused on building technologies for business that are delivered

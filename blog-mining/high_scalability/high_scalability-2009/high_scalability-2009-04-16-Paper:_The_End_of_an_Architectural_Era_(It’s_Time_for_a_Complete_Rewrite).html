<p>Introduction: The world of scalable databases is not a simple one. They come in every race,
creed, and color. Rick Cattell has brought some harmony to that world by
publishingHigh Performance Scalable Data Stores, a nicely detailed one stop
shop paper comparing scalable databases soley on the content of their
character. Ironically, the first step in that evaluation is dividing the world
into four groups:Key-value stores: Redis, Scalaris, Voldmort, and
Riak.Document stores: Couch DB, MongoDB, and SimpleDB.Record stores: BigTable,
HBase, HyperTable, and Cassandra.Scalable RDBMSs: MySQL Cluster, ScaleDB,
Drizzle, and VoltDB.The paper describes each system and then compares them on
the dimensions of Concurrency Control, Data Storage Replication, Transaction
Model, General Comments, Maturity, K-hits, License Language.And the winner is:
there are no winners. Yet. Rick concludes by pointing to a great convergence:I

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-

<p>Introduction: I have some experience with a very large OLTP system that is 7+ TB in size and
performs very well for 30K+ concurrent users. It is built using Intersystems
Cache based on the very old but very scalable MUMPS platform. Why don't I see
more discussions about archiectures such as these in this forum? I am curious
why this platform scales so much better then the typical RDBMS.</p><p>5 0.098702528 <a title="572-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-12-Paper%3A_Network_Stack_Specialization_for_Performance_.html">1594 high scalability-2014-02-12-Paper: Network Stack Specialization for Performance </a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the scalability is specialization department here is an interesting paper
presented atHotNets '13on high performance networking: Network Stack
Specialization for Performance.The idea is generalizing a service so it fits
in the kernel comes at a high performance cost. So move TCP into user space.
The result is a web server with ~3.5x the throughput of Nginx "while
experiencing low CPU utilization, linear scaling on multicore systems, and
saturating current NIC hardware."Here's a good description of the paper
publishedon Layer 9:Traditionally, servers and OSes have been built to be
general purpose. However now we have a high degree of specialization. In fact,
in a big web service, you might have thousands of machines dedicated to one
function. Therefore, there's scope for specialization. This paper looks at a
specific opportunity in that space. Network stacks today are good for high
throughput with large transfers, but not small files (which are common in web
browsing).

<p>Introduction: Abstract--This paper presents the architecture andcharacteristics of a memory
database intended to be used as acache engine for web applications. Primary
goals of this databaseare speed and efficiency while running on SMP systems
withseveral CPU cores (four and more). A secondary goal is thesupport for
simple metadata structures associated with cacheddata that can aid in
efficient use of the cache. Due to these goals,some data structures and

MudgeSteven ReinhardtThis International Symposium on Computer Architecture
paper seeks to understand and design next-generation servers for emerging
"warehouse-computing" environments. We make two key contributions. First, we
put together a detailed evaluation infrastructure including a new benchmark
suite for warehouse-computing workloads, and detailed performance, cost, and
power models, to quantitatively characterize bottlenecks. Second, we study a
new solution that incorporates volume non-server-class components in novel
packaging solutions, with memory sharing andflash-based disk caching. Our
results show that this approach has promise, with a 2X improvement on average
in performance-per-dollar for our benchmark suite.</p><p>4 0.68396324 <a title="572-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-20-Paper%3A_Flux%3A_An_Adaptive_Partitioning_Operator_for_Continuous_Query_Systems.html">604 high scalability-2009-05-20-Paper: Flux: An Adaptive Partitioning Operator for Continuous Query Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the core of the new real-time web, which is really really old, are
continuous queries. I like how this paper proposed to handle dynamic demand
and dynamic resource availability by making the underlying system adaptable,
which seems like a very cloudy kind of thing to do.Abstract:The long-running
nature of continuous queries poses new scalability challenges for dataflow
processing. CQ systems execute pipelined dataflows that may be shared across
multiplequeries. The scalability of these dataflows is limited by their
constituent, stateful operators - e.g. windowed joins or grouping operators.
To scale such operators, a natural solution is to partition them across a
shared-nothing platform. But in the CQ context, traditional, static
techniquesfor partitioned parallelism can exhibit detrimental imbalances as
workload and runtime conditions evolve. Longrunning CQ dataflows must continue
to function robustly inthe face of these imbalances. To address this
challenge, we introduce a dataflo</p><p>5 0.66301894 <a title="572-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-12-Paper%3A_Mind_the_Gap%3A_Reconnecting_Architecture_and_OS_Research.html">1039 high scalability-2011-05-12-Paper: Mind the Gap: Reconnecting Architecture and OS Research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mind the Gap: Reconnecting Architecture and OS Research is a paper presented
atHotOS XIII, the place where researchers talk about making potential futures
happen. For a great overview of the conference take a look at this article by
Matt Welsh: Conference report: HotOS 2011 in Napa.In the VM/cloud age I
question the need of having an OS at all, programs can compile directly
against "raw" hardware, but the paper does a good job of trying to figure out
the new roll operating systems can play in the future. We've been in a long OS
holding pattern, so long that we've seen the rise of PaaS vendors skipping the
OS level abstraction completely, but there's room for a middle ground between
legacy time sharing systems of the past and service level APIs that are but
one possible future.Introduction:For too long, operating systems researchers
and developers have pretty much taken whatever computer architects have dished
out.

the effects of the NUMA architecture. Jeremy Cole with a spectacular article
on the differences between NUMA and SMP/UMA systems and the mostly
unsatisfactory tricks required to get MySQL to perform on NUMA systems. There
are really two issues: the evils of an OS controlled swap and NUMA performance
effects due to a single node (in the NUMA sense) running out of memory. This
is the kind of stuff you only see when you push your systems to the edge.

<p>Introduction: Update 3:A Comparison of Approaches to Large-Scale Data Analysis: MapReduce
vs. DBMS Benchmarks.Although the process to load data into and tune the
execution of parallel DBMSs took much longer than the MR system, the observed
performance of these DBMSs was strikingly better.Update 2:H-Store: A Next
Generation OLTP DBMSis the project implementing the ideas in this paper:The
goal of the H-Store project is to investigate how these architectural and
application shifts affect the performance of OLTP databases, and to study what
performance benefits would be possible with a complete redesign of OLTP
systems in light of these trends. Our early results show that a simple
prototype built from scratch using modern assumptions can outperform current
commercial DBMS offerings by around a factor of 80 on OLTP workloads.Update:

<p>Introduction: John McCutchan,after a long career spent working on the Linux kernel and being
hired out as a code optimization guru, joined Google's Dart team. A curious
hire until you watch Bringing SIMD to the Web via Dart, where John makes a
programmer accessible explanation of why he likes Dart: performance,
performance, performance.Dartis an open-source Web programming
languagedeveloped by Google. The motivation for Dart is twofold: provide a
language capable of scaling up to the complex web applications that are
becoming the norm. Think Gmail. And provide a single language capable of
working on both the client and server. Towards those ends Dart is a complete
language, full tool environment, and provides an advanced Web UI framework for
building web applications at a high level of abstraction.Why isn't JavaScript
good enough? The fear is for large web apps the nature of JavaScript puts
crippling limits on potential performance improvements, which will cause web
apps to lose out to mobile apps.</p><p>6 0.86146694 <a title="572-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-14-Google_Says_Cloud_Prices_Will_Follow_Moore%E2%80%99s_Law%3A_Are_We_All_Renters_Now%3F.html">1647 high scalability-2014-05-14-Google Says Cloud Prices Will Follow Moore’s Law: Are We All Renters Now?</a></p>

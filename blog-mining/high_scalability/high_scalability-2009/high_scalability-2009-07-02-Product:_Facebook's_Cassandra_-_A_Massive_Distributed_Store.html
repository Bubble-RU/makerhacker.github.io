<p>Introduction: A firestorm of accusations circled around recently saying that Cassandra, the
elected-by-major-adopters emperor of the NoSQL movement, has no clothes. It
was said Twitter was dumping Cassandra; Reddit outages were linked to
Cassandra; and even Facebook, Cassandra's cradle of birth, was said to have
abandoned Cassandra. Shouts of NoSQL Fail! were heard in the streets. Much
gloating followed. Is the emperor really naked? Casually dressed maybe, but
not naked.(Note: after this point the article contains a flow chart that is
NSFW. Some people are very sensitive about cussing, so if that's you, please
go back, don't read on. Danger! There are no nude pictures or anything, just
some strong language. But this is my most favorite flow chart of all time, so
it's worth it :-)Is Twitter really abandoning Cassandra? Not according to
Twitter, which came out with a post,Cassandra at Twitter Today, explaining
that they are using Cassandra in production for geolocation and analytics.

datacenters,  2) the ability to add new machines to a live cluster

<p>Introduction: You may have read somewhere that Facebook has introduced a newSocial Inbox
integrating email, IM, SMS,  text messages, on-site Facebook messages. All-in-
all they need to store over 135 billion messages a month. Where do they store
all that stuff? Facebook's Kannan Muthukkaruppan gives the surprise answer
inThe Underlying Technology of Messages:HBase. HBase beat out MySQL,
Cassandra, and a few others.Why a surprise? Facebook created Cassandra and it
was purpose built for an inbox type application, but they found Cassandra's
eventual consistency model wasn't a good match for their new real-time
Messages product. Facebook also has an extensiveMySQL infrastructure, but they
found performance suffered as data set and indexes grew larger. And they could
have built their own, but they chose HBase.HBase is ascaleout table store
supporting very high rates of row-level updates over massive amounts of data.
Exactly what is needed for a Messaging system. HBase is also a column based

<p>Introduction: O'Reilly Radar's James Turner conducted avery informative interviewwith Joe
Stump, current CTO ofSimpleGeoand former lead architect atDigg, in which Joe
makes some of his usually insightful comments on his experience using
Cassandra vs MySQL. As Digg started out with aMySQL oriented architectureand
has recently beenmoving full speedto Cassandra, his observations on some of
their lessons learned and the motivation for the move are especially valuable.
Here are some of the key takeaways you find useful:Precompute on writes, make
reads fast. This is an oldie as a scaling strategy, but it's valuable to see
how SimpleGeo is applying it to their problem of finding entities within a
certain geographical region. Using Cassandra they've built two clusters: one
for indexes and one for records. The records cluster, as you might imagine, is
a simple data lookup. The index cluster has a carefully constructed key for
every lookup scenario. The indexes are computed on the write, so reads are

<p>Introduction: The High Scalable Systems (i.e. Websites) such as: Google, Facebook, Amazon,
etc. need high scalable storage system that can deal with huge amount of data
with high availability and reliability. Building large systems on top of a
traditional RDBMS data storage layer is no longer good enough. This
presentation explores the landscape of new technologies available today to
augment your data layer to improve performance and reliability.Remember: All

<p>Introduction: In the past year, Intel issued a series of powerful chips under the new
Nehalem microarchitecture, with large numbers of cores and extensive memory
capacity. This new class of chips is is part of a bigger Intel initiative
referred to as Tera-Scale Computing. Cisco has released their Unified
Computing System (UCS) equipped with a unique extended memory and high speed
network within the box, which is specifically geared to take advantage of this
type of CPU architecture .This new class of hardware has the potential to
revolutionize the IT landscape as we know it.In  this post, I want to focus
primarily on the potential implications on application architecture, more
specifically on the application platform landscape.  more...</p><p>3 0.87314129 <a title="649-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-19-How_to_measure_memory_required_for_a_user_session.html">472 high scalability-2008-12-19-How to measure memory required for a user session</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 2:Presentation from theNoSQL conference:slides,video.Update:Why you
won't be building your killer app on a distributed hash tableby Jonathan
Ellis.Why I think Cassandra is the most promising of the open-source
distributed databases --you get a relatively rich data model and a
distribution model that supports efficient range queries. These are not things
that can be grafted on top of a simpler DHT foundation, so Cassandra will be
useful for a wider variety of applications.James Hamilton has published a
thorough summary of Facebook's Cassandra, another scalable key-value store for
your perusal. It's open source and is described as a "BigTable data model
running on a Dynamo-like infrastructure." Cassandra is used in Facebook as an
email search system containing 25TB and over 100m mailboxes.Google Code for

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectivesis a series of posts that highlights the ideas that
will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires
an open mind. Warning #2: this post is wild.Kevin KellyKevin Kelly is Senior
Maverick at Wired magazine. He helped launch Wired in 1993, and served as its
Executive Editor until January 1999. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers'
Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online
service started in 1985. He authored the best-sellingNew Rules for the New
Economyand the classic book on decentralized emergent systems,Out of

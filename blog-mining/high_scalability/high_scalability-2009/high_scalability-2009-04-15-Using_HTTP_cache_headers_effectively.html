<p>Introduction: Over the years I've accumulated quite a rag tag collection of personal systems scattered wide across a galaxy of different servers. For the past month I've been on a quest to rationalize this conglomeration by moving everything to a managed service of one kind or another. The goal: lift a load of worry from my mind. I like to do my own stuff my self so I learn something and have control. Control always comes with headaches and it was time for a little aspirin. As part of the process GAE came in handy as a host for a few Twitter related scripts I couldn't manage to run  anywhere else. I recoded my simple little scripts into Python/GAE and learned a lot in the process.       In the move I exported HighScalability from a VPS and imported it into a shared hosting service. I could never quite configure Apache and MySQL well enough that they wouldn't spike memory periodically and crash the VPS. And since a memory crash did not automatically restarted it was unacceptable. I also wrote a scrip</p><p>3 0.11488579 <a title="571-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-04-A_Bunch_of_Great_Strategies_for_Using_Memcached_and_MySQL_Better_Together.html">360 high scalability-2008-08-04-A Bunch of Great Strategies for Using Memcached and MySQL Better Together</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case. Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on Fotolog in  Secrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success , which was one of my personal favorites.  Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding performance and scaling requirements. To meet those requirements they've developed a</p><p>4 0.10832363 <a title="571-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-04-Try_Squid_as_a_Reverse_Proxy.html">59 high scalability-2007-08-04-Try Squid as a Reverse Proxy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This scalability strategy is brought to you by Erik Osterman:   My recommendations for anyone dealing with explosive growth on a limited budget with lots of cachable content (e.g. content capable of returning valid expiration headers) is employ a    reverse proxy    as mentioned in this article.   In the last week, we had a site get AP'd, triggering 100K unique visitors to a single IIS server in under 5 hours. It took out the IIS server. Placing a single squid infront of the server handled the entire onslaught with a max server load of 0.10 on a modest Intel IV 3Ghz.  It's trivial to implement for anyone interested...</p><p>5 0.10087086 <a title="571-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-30-Better_Browser_Caching_is_More_Important_than_No_Javascript_or_Fast_Networks_for_HTTP_Performance.html">1396 high scalability-2013-01-30-Better Browser Caching is More Important than No Javascript or Fast Networks for HTTP Performance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Performance guru  Steve Souders  gave his keynote presentation,  Cache is King!  ( slides ), at the HTML5DevCon, besides being an extremely clear explanation of how caching works on the Internet and how to optimize your use of HTTP to get the best performance, Steve ran experiments that found some surprising results on what gave the best web site performance improvements.

<p>Introduction: Isn't the secret to fast, scalable websites to  cache everything ? Caching, if not the  secret sauce  of many a website, is it at least a popular condiment. But not so fast says Peter Zaitsev in  Beyond great cache hit ratio . The point Peter makes is that we read about websites like  Amazon  and  Facebook  that can literally make hundreds of calls to satisfy a user request. Even if you have an awesome cache hit ratio, pages can still be slow because making and processing all those requests takes time. The solution is to  remove requests all together . You do this by  caching larger blocks  so you have to make fewer requests. 
 
The post has a lot of good advice worth reading: 1) Make non cacheable blocks as small as possible, 2) Maximize amount of uses of the cache item, 3) Control invalidation, 4) Multi-Get.</p><p>4 0.70511949 <a title="571-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-28-6_Strategies_for_Scaling_BBC_iPlayer.html">908 high scalability-2010-09-28-6 Strategies for Scaling BBC iPlayer</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The BBC's iPlayer site averages 8 million page views a day for 1.3 million users. Technical Architect Simon Frost describes how they scaled their site in   Scaling the BBC iPlayer to handle demand :
  
  Use frameworks . Frameworks support component based development which makes it convenient for team development, but can introduce delays that have to be minimized. Zend/PHP is used because it supports components and is easy to recruit for.Â  MySQL is used for program metadata. CouchDB is used for key-value access for fast read/write of user-focused data. 
  Prove architecture before building it . Eliminate guesswork by coming up with alternate architectures and create prototypes to determine which option works best. Balance performance with factors like ease of development.  
  Cache a lot . Data is cached in memcached for a few seconds to minutes. Short cache invalidation periods keep the data up to date for the users, but even these short periods make a huge difference in performance.</p><p>5 0.70107716 <a title="571-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-17-Intro_to_Caching%2CCaching_algorithms_and_caching_frameworks_part_1.html">495 high scalability-2009-01-17-Intro to Caching,Caching algorithms and caching frameworks part 1</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi,     Some time ago , martin fowler bloged about how HTTP cache headers can be very effectively used in web site design.   http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/SegmentationByFreshness.html     How actively HTTP cache headers are considered in web site design? I think it is a great tool to reduce lot of load on server and should be considered before designing any complex caching strategy. Thoughts?     Thanks,   Unmesh</p><p>2 0.83395392 <a title="571-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-29-How_to_choice_and_build_perfect_server.html">585 high scalability-2009-04-29-How to choice and build perfect server</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are a lot of questions about the server components, and how to choice and/or build perfect server with consider the power consumption. So I decide to  write about this topic .  Key Points:
  
 What kind of components the servers needs 
 
 The Green Computing and the Servers components. 
 
 How much power the server consume. 
 
 Choice the right components: Processors, HDD, RAID, Memory   
  Build Server, or buy?</p><p>3 0.82098651 <a title="571-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-08-Servers_Component_-_How_to_choice_and_build_perfect_server.html">653 high scalability-2009-07-08-Servers Component - How to choice and build perfect server</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are a lot of questions about how the server components, and how to build perfect server with consider the power consumption. Today  I will discuss  the Server components, and how we can choice better server components with consider the power consumption, efficacy, performance, and price.  Key points:
  
 What kind of components the servers needs? 
 The Green Computing and the Servers components 
 How much power the server consume 
 Choice the right components:
 
 Processor 
 Hard Disk Drive 
 Memory 
 Operating system

<p>Introduction: If like many humans you've found even  Paxos Made Simple  a bit difficult to understand, you might enjoy RAFT as described in  In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm  by Stanford's  Diego Ongaro  and John Ousterhout. The video presentation of the paper is given by  John Ousterhout . Both the paper and the video are delightfully accessible.
 
 mcherm  has a good summary of the paper:
  
 A consensus algorithm is: a cluster of servers should record a series of records ("log entries") in response to requests from clients of the cluster. (It may also take action based on those entries.) It does so in a way that guarantees that the responses seen by clients of the cluster will be consistent EVEN in the face of servers crashing in unpredictable ways (but not loosing data that was synched to disk), and networks introducing unpredictable delays or communication blockages. 
  
 Here's what Raft does. First, it elects a leader, then the leader records the master version of the log, t</p><p>5 0.76867783 <a title="571-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-16-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_June_16%2C_2010.html">842 high scalability-2010-06-16-Hot Scalability Links for June 16, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You're Doing it Wrong  by Poul-Henning Kamp. Don't look so guilty, he's not talking about you know what, he's talking about writing high-performance server programs:  Not just wrong as in not perfect, but wrong as in wasting half, or more, of your performance. What good is an  O(log2(n))  algorithm if those operations cause page faults and slow disk operations? For most relevant datasets an  O(n)  or even an  O(n^2)  algorithm, which avoids page faults, will run circles around it.   
  A Microsoft Windows Azure primer: the basics  by Peter Bright. Nice article explaining the basics of Azure and how it compares to Google and Amazon. 
 A call to change the name from  NoSQL to Postmodern Databases . Interesting idea, but the problem is the same one I have for Postmodern Art, when is it? I always feel like I'm in the post-post modern period, yet for art it's really in the early 1900s. Let's save future developers from this existential time crisis.

<p>Introduction: On the surface nothing appears more different than soft data and hard raw
materials like iron. Then isn't itironic, in theAlanis Morissettesense, that
in this Age of Information, great wealth still lies hidden deep beneath piles
of stuff? It's so strange how directly digging for dollars in data parallels
the great wealth producing models of the Industrial Revolution.The piles of
stuff is the Internet. It takes lots of prospecting to find the right stuff.
Mighty web crawling machines tirelessly collect stuff, bringing it into their
huge maws, then depositing load after load into rack after rack of distributed
file system machines. Then armies of still other machines take this stuff and
strip out the valuable raw materials, which in the Information Age, are
endless bytes of raw data. Link clicks, likes, page views, content, head
lines, searches, inbound links, outbound links, search clicks, hashtags,
friends, purchases: anything and everything you do on the Internet is a
valuable raw mat</p><p>3 0.076307967 <a title="604-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-19-Space_Based_Programming_in_.NET.html">709 high scalability-2009-09-19-Space Based Programming in .NET</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Space-based architectures are an alternative to the traditional n-tier model
for enterprise applications. Instead of a vertical tier partitioning, space
based applications are partitioned horizontally into self-sufficient units.
This leads to almost linear scalability of stateful, high-performance
applications.This is arecording of a talk I did last monthwhere I introduce
space based programming and demonstrate how that works in practice on the .NET
platform using Oracle Coherence and GigaSpaces.</p><p>4 0.073093936 <a title="604-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-31-Designing_for_Resiliency_will_be_so_2013.html">1379 high scalability-2012-12-31-Designing for Resiliency will be so 2013</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A big part of engineering for a quality experience is bringing in thelong
tail. An improbable severe failure can ruin your experience of a site, even if
your average experience is quite good. That's where building for resilience
comes in. Resiliency used to be outside the realm of possibility for the
common system. It was simply too complex and too expensive.An evolution has
been underway, making 2013 possibly the first time resiliency is truly on the
table as a standard part of system architectures. We are getting the clouds,
we are getting the tools, and prices are almost low enough.Even Netflix,real
leadersin the resiliency architecture game, took some heat for relying
completely on Amazon's ELB and not having a backup load balancing system,
leading to a prolonged Christmas Eve failure. Adrian Cockcroft, Cloud
Architect at Netflix, said they've investigated creating their own load
balancing service, but that "we try not to invest in undifferentiated heavy
lifting."So resiliency is s</p><p>5 0.07170631 <a title="604-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-07-Joost_Network_Architecture.html">83 high scalability-2007-09-07-Joost Network Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We are at the beginning of the multicore era. Computers will have increasingly
many cores (processors), but there is still no good programming framework for
these architectures, and thus no simple and unified way for machine learning
to take advantage of the potential speed up.In this paper, we develop a
broadly applicable parallel programming method, one that is easily applied to
many different learning algorithms. Our work is in distinct contrast to the
tradition in machine learning of designing (often ingenious) ways to speed up
a single algorithm at a time.Specifically, we show that algorithms that fit
the Statistical Query model can be written in a certain “summation form,”
which allows them to be easily parallelized on multicore computers. We adapt
Google’s map-reduce paradigm to demonstrate this parallel speed up technique
on a variety of learning algorithms including locally weighted linear

paper seeks to understand and design next-generation servers for emerging

put together a detailed evaluation infrastructure including a new benchmark
suite for warehouse-computing workloads, and detailed performance, cost, and
power models, to quantitatively characterize bottlenecks. Second, we study a
new solution that incorporates volume non-server-class components in novel
packaging solutions, with memory sharing andflash-based disk caching. Our
results show that this approach has promise, with a 2X improvement on average

<p>Introduction: In the never ending quest to figure out how to do something useful with never
ending streams of data, GraphLab: A New Framework For Parallel Machine
Learning wants to go beyond low-level programming, MapReduce, and dataflow
languages with a new parallel framework for ML (machine learning) which
exploits the sparse structure and common computational patterns of ML
algorithms. GraphLab enables ML experts to easily design and implement
efﬁcient scalable parallel algorithms by composing problem speciﬁc
computation, data-dependencies, and scheduling.  Our main contributions
include: A graph-based data model which simultaneously represents data and
computational dependencies. A set of concurrent access models which provide a
range of sequential-consistency guarantees. A sophisticated modular scheduling
mechanism. An aggregation framework to manage global state. From the

<p>Introduction: In some ways the original Amazon cloud, the one most of us still live in, was
like that really cool house that when you stepped inside and saw the oldgreen
shag carpetin the living room, you knew the house hadn't been updated in a
while. The network is a little slow, the processors are a bit dated, and
virtualization made the house just feel smaller. It has been difficult to run
high bandwidth or low latency workloads in the cloud. Bottlenecks everywhere.
Not a big deal for most applications, but for many high performance
applications (HPC) it was a killer.In a typical house you might just do a
remodel. Upgrade a few rooms. Swap out builder quality appliances with
gleaming stainless steel monsters. But Amazon has a big lot, instead of
remodeling they simply keep adding on entire new wings, kind of like the
Winchester Mystery Houseof computing.The first new wing added was aCPU based

<p>Introduction: At the core of the new real-time web, which is really really old, are
continuous queries. I like how this paper proposed to handle dynamic demand
and dynamic resource availability by making the underlying system adaptable,
which seems like a very cloudy kind of thing to do.Abstract:The long-running
nature of continuous queries poses new scalability challenges for dataflow
processing. CQ systems execute pipelined dataflows that may be shared across
multiplequeries. The scalability of these dataflows is limited by their
constituent, stateful operators - e.g. windowed joins or grouping operators.
To scale such operators, a natural solution is to partition them across a
shared-nothing platform. But in the CQ context, traditional, static
techniquesfor partitioned parallelism can exhibit detrimental imbalances as
workload and runtime conditions evolve. Longrunning CQ dataflows must continue
to function robustly inthe face of these imbalances. To address this
challenge, we introduce a dataflo</p><p>2 0.74042737 <a title="604-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-25-Advanced_BPM_program__in_USA_and_India__discount_for_Group_Membership.html">520 high scalability-2009-02-25-Advanced BPM program  in USA and India  discount for Group Membership</a></p>

<p>Introduction: What data structure is more sacred than the link list? If we get rid of it
what silly interview questions would we use instead? But not using linked-
lists is exactly what Aater Suleman recommends inShould you ever use Linked-
Lists?InThe Secret To 10 Million Concurrent Connectionsone of the important
strategies is not scribbling data all over memory via pointers because
following pointers increases cache misses whichreduces performance. And
there's nothing more iconic of pointers than the link list.Here are Aeter's
reasons to be anti-linked-list:They reduce the benefit of out-of-order
execution.They throw off hardware prefetching.They reduce DRAM and TLB
locality.They cannot leverage SIMD.They are harder to send to GPUs.He also
demolishes the pros of linked-lists, finding arrays a better option in almost
every case. Good discussion in the comment section as not everyone
agrees.Patrick Wyatt detailshow a linked-list threading bugrepeatedly crashed

<p>Introduction: MySQL Scale-Out by application partitioningby Oli SennhauserEventually every
database system hit its limits. Especially on the Internet, where you have
millions of users which theoretically access your database simultaneously,
eventually your IO system will be a bottleneck. [A] promising but more complex
solution with nearly no scale-out limits is application partitioning. If and
when you get into the top-1000 rank on alexa [1], you have to think about such
solutions.A Quick Hit of What's InsideHorizontal application partitioning,

<p>Introduction: The Gear6 Web Cache hybrid DRAM-flash memory architecture allows for 5-10
times more memcache memory per unit of rack space than DRAM-only
configurations, and cuts memory costs by 50%. Other software enhancements
include a slab allocator that is more efficient than traditional memcache
implementations due to its fine-grained bucket sizing. Gear6 Web Cache also
supports object sizes greater than 1 megabyte and manages evictions based on
the cost of replacing objects, depending on the size and frequency of object
access. It intelligently places cache instances across DRAM and flash, taking
into account their different characteristics, while at the same time
monitoring their health and detecting and deâ&euro;?allocating faulty or failing
memory.Gear6 Web Cache is a Memcached protocol compliant solution that scales
and accelerates web applications, reduces memory footprint, enhances
availability and implements comprehensive Memcached management features.
Designed to work with all popular memcache</p><p>6 0.61651367 <a title="604-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-15-Vedis_-_An_Embedded_Implementation_of_Redis_Supporting_Terabyte_Sized_Databases.html">1580 high scalability-2014-01-15-Vedis - An Embedded Implementation of Redis Supporting Terabyte Sized Databases</a></p>

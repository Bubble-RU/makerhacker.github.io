<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great scalability solution, but caching also  comes with problems .  Sharding  is a great scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in a  post-mortem  about their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database Foursquare uses, also contributed their  post-mortem  of what went wrong too.
 
Now that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?
 
First, like for  Facebook , huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in a pretty cool industry.
 
Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built by a small group of people, under immense pressure</p><p>3 0.10569184 <a title="549-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-27-eBay_Architecture.html">331 high scalability-2008-05-27-eBay Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2:  EBay's Randy Shoup spills the secrets of how to service hundreds of millions of users and over two billion page views a day in Scalability  Best Practices: Lessons from eBay  on InfoQ. The practices: Partition by Function, Split Horizontally, Avoid Distributed Transactions,  Decouple Functions Asynchronously, Move Processing To Asynchronous Flows, Virtualize At All Levels, Cache Appropriately.  Update:   eBay Serves 5 Billion API Calls Each Month .  Aren't we seeing more and more traffic driven by mashups composed on top of open APIs? APIs are no longer a bolt on, they are your application. Architecturally that argues for implementing your own application around the same APIs developers and users employ.   Who hasn't wondered how eBay does their business?

<p>Introduction: This question was sent in by Val, who asking for a little help in creating the next big thing. Any ideas? 
 
I'm  planning to run my own, first startup website and have been surfing the  webs for relevant info to plan the technology I will use for it (the  frontend and the backend, including the software and the hardware). The  website will be something like a combination of:
  
  MegaUpload (users will upload their files) 
  iTunes (users will be paid for their uploads) 
  and YouTube (in the future I'm planning to let users watch/listen to the content online, without downloading). 
  
I don't have any investors yet, nor the budget - I'm still preparing the  idea and I'm going to create first implementation (an "alpha version")  before I show it to potential investors. Hence the initial technologies  have to be extremely cheap *but* also highly scalable in the future so  that I don't have to redo anything when the website grows.    Unfortunately I don't have much experience in running</p><p>5 0.094798207 <a title="549-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-21-SQL_%2B_NoSQL_%3D_Yes_%21.html">961 high scalability-2010-12-21-SQL + NoSQL = Yes !</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by     Frédéric Faure      (architect at    Ysance   ), you can follow him on    twitter   .  
 
Data storage has always been one of the most difficult problems to address, especially as the quantity of stored data is constantly increasing. This is not simply due to the growing numbers of people regularly using the Internet, particularly with all the social networks, games and gizmos now available. Companies are also amassing more and more meticulous information relevant to their business, in order to optimize productivity and ROI (Return On Investment). I find the positioning of SQL and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) as opposites rather a shame: it’s true that the marketing wave of NoSQL has enabled the renewed promotion of a system that’s been around for quite a while, but which was only rarely considered in most cases, as after all, everything could be fitted into the « good old SQL model ». The reverse trend of wanting to make everything fit the NoSQL model is not very p</p><p>6 0.093468025 <a title="549-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-06-An_Unorthodox_Approach_to_Database_Design_%3A_The_Coming_of_the_Shard.html">672 high scalability-2009-08-06-An Unorthodox Approach to Database Design : The Coming of the Shard</a></p>

<p>Introduction: How many times have you been called in the middle of the night by your operation guys telling you that your application throws some odd red alerts? How many times did you found out that when those issues happens you don't have enough information to analyze this incident? have you tried to increase the log level just to find out that your problem became even worse - now your application throws tons of information in a continues basis most of which is complete garbage...  The current separation between the way we implement our application and the way we manage it leads to many of this ridicules situations. Cloud makes those things even worse.  In  this post  i suggest an alternative approach. Why don't we run our application the way we run our business?  I refer to this approach as the "interactive cloud" where our application behaves just like our project team and the operations just like our managers. As with our business our application would need to take more responsibility to the wa</p><p>3 0.63149345 <a title="549-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-26-Sharding_the_Hibernate_Way.html">358 high scalability-2008-07-26-Sharding the Hibernate Way</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update :  A very nice JavaWorld podcast interview with  Google engineer Max Ross on Hibernate Shards . Max defines Hibernate Shards (horizontal partitioning), how it works (pretty well), virtual shards (don't ask), what they need to do in the future (query, replication, operational tools), and how it relates to Google AppEngine (not much).   To scale you are supposed to partition your data. Sounds good, but how do you do it? When you actually sit down to work out all the details it’s not that easy. Hibernate Shards to the rescue! Hibernate shards is: an extension to the core Hibernate product that adds facilities for horizontal partitioning. If you know the core Hibernate API you know the shards API. No learning curve at all. Here is what a few members of the core group had to say about the Hibernate Shards open source project. Although there are some limitations, from the sound of it they are doing useful stuff in the right way and it’s very much worth looking at, especially if you us</p><p>4 0.62691998 <a title="549-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-01-Hot_Trend%3A__Move_Behavior_to_Data_for_a_New_Interactive_Application_Architecture.html">933 high scalability-2010-11-01-Hot Trend:  Move Behavior to Data for a New Interactive Application Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Two forces account for the trend of moving behavior to data: larger values used in key-value stores and spotty cloud networks. For some time we've seen functions pushed close to data with MapReduce, which is a batch process, but we are now seeing this model extend to interactive applications, which match the current emphasis on highly scalable, real-time, event driven applications.
 
To see the trend look at the increasing support for collocated behavior at the datastore level:
  
 HBase is implementing a  coprocessor feature . 
 Cassandra is also implementing  coprocessors or plugins . 
 Membase is creating  NodeCode , which is a process for executing functions on data in the database. 
 MongoDB supports  JavaScript stored procedures .  
 VoltDB has  Java based stored procedures . 
  In-memory DataGrid  products like GigaSpaces have been doing something like this forever. The key difference historically being GigaSpaces' tight integration with languages C++ and Java, instead of using</p><p>5 0.62545311 <a title="549-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-10-A_Perfect_Fifth_of_Notes_on_Scalability.html">1172 high scalability-2012-01-10-A Perfect Fifth of Notes on Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeremiah Peschka with a great a set of  Notes on Scalability , just in case you do reach your wildest expectations of success:
  
   Build it to Break . Plan for the fact that everything you make is going to break. Design in layers that are independent and redundant. 
  Everything is a Feature . Your application is a set of features created by a series of conscious choices made by considering trade-offs.  
  Scale Out, Not Up . Purchasing more hardware is easier than coding and managing horizontal resources.  
  Buy More Storage . Large numbers of smaller, faster drives have more IOPS than fewer, larger drives. 
  You’re Going to Do It Wrong . Be prepared to iterate on your ideas. You will make mistakes.  Be prepared to re-write code and to quickly move on to the next idea.

<p>Introduction: All,     I'm looking for a faster/reliable solution for DR/BC as well as for sclability for my web/db servers. I came across VMWare Infrastructure and other products. The I/O performance concerns me to go with virtual servers. I'm also looking into imaging software such as Acrnois.     Could anyone share their thoughts on how it's being done with bigger names such as google/youtube etc..?     Thank you,   Regards,   Janakan Rajendran.</p><p>2 0.99408364 <a title="549-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-06-Announce%3A_First_Meeting_of_Boston_Scalability_User_Group.html">268 high scalability-2008-03-06-Announce: First Meeting of Boston Scalability User Group</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A common problem of the application designers is to predict when they need to start worrying about the Architectural/System improvements on their application. Do I need to add more resources? If yes, then how long before I am compelled to do so? The question is not only when but also what. Should I plan to implement a true caching layer on top of my application or do I need to shard my database. Do I need to move to a distributed search infrastructure and if yes when ! Essentially we try to find out the functionalities of the application that will become critical over time.</p><p>4 0.98387587 <a title="549-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-19-UK_Based_CDN.html">324 high scalability-2008-05-19-UK Based CDN</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,    I was wondering if I could borrow the collective minds of you all to draw up a list to the CDN's that you'd use/do use in the UK.  If they're outside the UK but have decent support then also include.  The service must be cheap and not require a huge setup fee, it's really only for a small time business; it shares video & high-res pics so mass cheap storage is a must and wondered whether you guys had any ideas, also costs?     Mass storage isn't cheap in the UK compared to the states, for example, unless I go colo but as I say, it's a small setup but happens to require a fair bit of space.  Would S3 be a good starting point?  What is the service like?  I hear mixed reviews about it.     Many thanks,   Jim</p><p>5 0.97525245 <a title="549-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-13-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Facing_scaling_issues_with_news_feeds_on_Redis.__Any_advice%3F.html">1303 high scalability-2012-08-13-Ask HighScalability: Facing scaling issues with news feeds on Redis.  Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.    We're basically using a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget). Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text, author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.    I'm wondering if we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to g</p><p>6 0.96887666 <a title="549-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine_Snippet_Search_New_Indexing_Technology.html">746 high scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine Snippet Search New Indexing Technology</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:  Jake in  Does Django really scale better than Rails?  thinks apps like FFS shouldn't need so much hardware to scale.  In a short three months Friends for Sale (think Hot-or-Not with a market economy) grew to become a top 10 Facebook application handling 200 gorgeous requests per second and a stunning 300 million page views a month. They did all this using Ruby on Rails,  two part time developers, a cluster of a dozen machines, and a fairly standard architecture. How did Friends for Sale scale to sell all those beautiful people? And how much do you think your friends are worth on the open market?Â

<p>Introduction: Update 6:  Some interesting changes from Twitter's  Evan Weaver : everything in RAM now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability; switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them locally.  Update 5:   Twitter on Scala . A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners.

<p>Introduction: Update 6 :  nginx_http_push_module . Turn nginx into a long-polling message queuing HTTP push server.
 
 Update 5 : In  Load Balancer Update  Barry describes how WordPress.com moved from Pound to Nginx and are now "regularly serving about 8-9k requests/second  and about 1.2Gbit/sec through a few Nginx instances and have plenty of room to grow!".   Update 4 :  Nginx better than Pound for load balancing.  Pound spikes at 80% CPU, Nginx uses 3% and is easier to understand and better documented.  Update 3 : igvita.com combines two cool tools together for better performance in  Nginx and Memcached, a 400% boost! .  Update 2 : Software Project on  Installing Nginx Web Server w/ PHP and SSL . Breaking away from mother Apache can be a scary proposition and this kind of getting started article really helps easy the separation.  Update:  Slicehost has some nice  tutorials on setting up Nginx .

<p>Introduction: This is a guest a post by Alvaro Videla describing their architecture for  Poppen.de , a popular German dating site. This site is very much NSFW, so be careful before clicking on the link. What I found most interesting is how they manage to sucessfully blend a little of the old with a little of the new, using technologies like Nginx, MySQL, CouchDB, and Erlang, Memcached, RabbitMQ, PHP, Graphite, Red5, and Tsung.
  What is Poppen.de?  
Poppen.de (NSFW) is the top dating website in  Germany, and while it may be a small site compared to giants like Flickr  or Facebook, we believe it's a nice architecture to learn from if you  are starting to get some scaling problems.

<p>Introduction: Tim Bray  has a wonderful  interview with Casey Forbes , creator of Ravelry, a Ruby on Rails site supporting a 400,000+ strong community of dedicated knitters and crocheters.   Casey and his small team have done great things with Ravelry. It is a very focused site that provides a lot of value for users. And users absolutely adore the site.

<p>Introduction: How do you keep a system small enough, while still being successful, that a simple scale-up strategy becomes the preferred architecture?  StackOverflow , for example, could stick with a tool chain they were comfortable with because theyÂ had a natural brake on how fast they could grow: there are only so many programmers in the world. If this doesn't work for you, here's another natural braking strategy to consider:  charge for your service .  Paul Houle  summarized this nicely as:  avoid scaling problems by building a service that's profitable at a small scale .
 
This interesting point, one I hadn't properly considered before, was brought up by Maciej Ceglowski, co-founder of  Pinboard.in , in an interview with Leo Laporte and Amber MacArthur on their their  net@night  show.
 
Pinboard is a lean, mean, pay for bookmarking machine, a timely replacement for the nearly departed Delicious. And as a self professed anti-social bookmarking site, itÂ  emphasizesÂ speed over socializing .

<p>Introduction: Pud of  f*ckedcomany.com Â (FC) fame, a favorite site of the dot bomb era, and a site I absolutely loved until my company became featured, has given us a look at his backend:Â  Why Must You Laugh At My Back End . For those whose don't remember FC's history, TechCrunch published a  fitting eulogy :
  

[FC] first went live in 2000, chronicling failing and troubled companies in its unique and abrasive style after the dot com bust. Within a year it had a massive audience and was getting serious mainstream press attention. As the startup economy became better in 2004, much of the attention the site received went away. But a large and loyal audience remains at the site, coming back day after day for its unique slant on the news. At its peak, FC had 4 million unique monthly visitors.

  
Delightfully, FC was not a real-names kind of site. Hard witty cynicism ruled andÂ not a single cat picture was in sight. It was a blast of fun when all around was the enclosing dark.

<p>Introduction: Fotolog, a social blogging site centered around photos, grew from about 300 thousand users in 2004 to over 11 million users in 2007. Though they initially experienced the inevitable pains of rapid growth, they overcame their problems and now manage over 300 million photos and 800,000 new photos are added each day. Generating all that fabulous content are 20 million unique monthly visitors and a volunteer army of 30,000 new users each day. They did so well a very impressed suitor bought them out for a cool $90 million. That's scale meets success by anyone standards. How did they do it?

<p>Introduction: Tim Bray  has a wonderful  interview with Casey Forbes , creator of Ravelry, a Ruby on Rails site supporting a 400,000+ strong community of dedicated knitters and crocheters.   Casey and his small team have done great things with Ravelry. It is a very focused site that provides a lot of value for users. And users absolutely adore the site. That's obvious from their enthusiastic comments and rocket fast adoption of Ravelry.  Ten years ago a site like Ravelry would have been a multi-million dollar operation. Today Casey is the sole engineer for Ravelry and to run it takes only a few people. He was able to code it in 4 months working nights and weekends. Take a look down below of all the technologies used to make Ravelry and you'll see how it is constructed almost completely from free of the shelf software that Casey has stitched together into a complete system. There's an amazing amount of leverage in today's ecosystem when you combine all the quality tools, languages, storage, bandwidth</p><p>4 0.94110602 <a title="711-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-26-Finding_an_excellent_LAMP_developer.html">193 high scalability-2007-12-26-Finding an excellent LAMP developer</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi...      I have this idea to start a really great and scalable website, and I am building it!  So far I'm doing everything myself - coding, networking, architecture planning, everything.  I haven't even gotten into the legal aspects yet.......     It would be MUCH easier if I had a technical person to handle that end of the operation.  I'm a good coder, but like Bill Gates at Harvard for Math, I'm not the very best.  I'd like to FIND that very best person available, to handle the technical aspects.  For worse or better, I don't presently know somebody who fits this bill.     I've posted a bazillion ads on Craig's List, with no really qualified responses.  I've put out feelers among my own network, same result.  Not sure what else I can do.  Shoestring budget, so it's sweat equity in the beginning.  That can actually be a plus, as it forces people to focus.     Any ideas about what else I can do, to attract the right person?     Thanks   Jason</p><p>5 0.93305254 <a title="711-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-23-Paper%3A_Calvin%3A_Fast_Distributed_Transactions_for_Partitioned_Database_Systems.html">1463 high scalability-2013-05-23-Paper: Calvin: Fast Distributed Transactions for Partitioned Database Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Distributed transactions are costly because they use  agreement protocols . Calvin says, surprisingly, that using a deterministic database allows you to avoid the use of agreement protocols. The approach is to use a deterministic transaction layer that does all the hard work before acquiring locks and the beginning of transaction execution.      Overview:   Many distributed storage systems achieve high data access throughput via partitioning and replication, each system with its own advantages and tradeoffs. In order to achieve high scalability, however, todayâs systems generally reduce transactional support, disallowing single transactions from spanning multiple partitions. CalvinÂ is a practical transaction scheduling and data replication layer thatÂ uses a deterministic ordering guarantee to signiï¬cantly reduce theÂ normally prohibitive contention costs associated with distributedÂ transactions. Unlike previous deterministic database system prototypes, Calvin supports disk-based storage</p><p>6 0.93268675 <a title="711-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-09-26-WordPress.com_Serves_70%2C000_req-sec_and_over_15_Gbit-sec_of_Traffic_using_NGINX.html">1329 high scalability-2012-09-26-WordPress.com Serves 70,000 req-sec and over 15 Gbit-sec of Traffic using NGINX</a></p>

<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built
by a small group of people, under immense pressure, trying to get a lot of

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: A non-random sample of my tech friends shows that not many have heard
ofmemristors(though I do suspect vote tampering). I'd read a little about
memristors in2008when the initial hubbub about the existence of memristors was
raised. I, however,  immediately filed them into that comforting conceptual
bucket of potentially revolutionary technologies I didn't have to worry about
because like most wondertech, nothing would ever come of it. Wrong. After
watchingFinding the Missing Memristorby R. Stanley Williams I've had to change
my mind. Memristors have gone from "maybe never" to holy cow this could happen
soon and it could change everything.Let's assume for the sake of dreaming
memristors do prove out. How will we design systems when we have access to a
new material that is two orders of magnitude more efficient from a power
perspective than traditional transistor technologies, contains multiple
petabits (1 petabit = 128TB) of persistent storage, and can be reconfigured to
be either memory</p><p>4 0.82453531 <a title="538-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-02-Using_the_Ambient_Cloud_as_an_Application_Runtime.html">786 high scalability-2010-03-02-Using the Ambient Cloud as an Application Runtime</a></p>

Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.The future looks many,
big, complex, and adaptive:Many clouds.Many servers.Many operating
systems.Many languages.Many storage services.Many database services.Many
software services.Many adjunct human networks (like Mechanical Turk).Many fast

(simple request-response, live streaming, computationally complex, sensor
driven, memory intensive, storage intensive, monolithic, decomposable,
etc).Many legal jurisdictions. Don't want to perform a function on Patriot Act
"protected" systems then move the function elsewhere.Many SLAs.Many data

"seats" to maximize profit using multi-variate time sensitive pricing
models.Many competitive products. The need to defend your territory never

<p>Introduction: Two forces account for the trend of moving behavior to data: larger values
used in key-value stores and spotty cloud networks. For some time we've seen
functions pushed close to data with MapReduce, which is a batch process, but
we are now seeing this model extend to interactive applications, which match
the current emphasis on highly scalable, real-time, event driven
applications.To see the trend look at the increasing support for collocated
behavior at the datastore level:HBase is implementing a coprocessor
feature.Cassandra is also implementing coprocessors or plugins.Membase is
creatingNodeCode, which is a process for executing functions on data in the
database.MongoDB supportsJavaScript stored procedures. VoltDB hasJava based
stored procedures.In-memory DataGridproducts like GigaSpaces have been doing
something like this forever. The key difference historically being GigaSpaces'
tight integration with languages C++ and Java, instead of using a language
agnostic protocol based appr</p><p>6 0.82432485 <a title="538-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-24-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_24%2C_2012.html">1198 high scalability-2012-02-24-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 24, 2012</a></p>

for following up re: all of my questions on cr1 provisioning. We saw a huge
win moving from m1.xl to cr1.8xl@rob_carlson: Packet switching via containers
--> almost 8X increase in trade; what will #drones bring? What is optimal mesh
size?@mrtazz: "an Open Source, Clojure-based DevOps platform" congratulations,
I now have no idea what you're talking about@KentBeck: If you can't make
engineering decisions based on data, then make engineering decisions that
result in data.@cassandralondon: Cassandra on AWS SSDs - a perfect fit because
you don't get write amplification If you think about it, a cloud as a rule
driven, capability rich environment, accessible over a large surfaced API,
plays the same role as physics in biology. Software must specify every little

<p>Introduction: InNoSQL: Past, Present, FutureEric Brewerhas a particularly fine section on
explaining the often hard to understand ideas ofBASE(Basically Available, Soft
State, Eventually Consistent),ACID(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation,
Durability),CAP(Consistency Availability, Partition Tolerance), in terms of a
pernicious long standing myth about the sanctity of consistency in
banking.Myth: Money is important, so banksmustuse transactions to keep money
safe and consistent, right?Reality: Banking transactions are inconsistent,
particularly for ATMs. ATMs are designed to have a normal case behaviour and a
partition mode behaviour. In partition mode Availability is chosen over
Consistency.Why?1)Availability correlates with revenue and consistency
generally does not.2)Historically there was never an idea of perfect
communication so everything was partitioned.Your ATM transaction must go
through so Availability is more important than consistency. If the ATM is down
then you aren't making money. If yo</p><p>3 0.97633803 <a title="538-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-09-Data_Replication_in_NoSQL_Databases.html">1279 high scalability-2012-07-09-Data Replication in NoSQL Databases</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is the third guest post (part 1,part 2) of a series by Greg Lindahl, CTO
of blekko, the spam free search engine. Previously, Greg was Founder and
Distinguished Engineer at PathScale, at which he was the architect of the
InfiniPath low-latency InfiniBand HCA, used to build tightly-coupled
supercomputing clusters.blekko's home-grown NoSQL database was designed from
the start to support a web-scale search engine, with 1,000s of servers and
petabytes of disk. Data replication is a very important part of keeping the
database up and serving queries. Like many NoSQL database authors, we decided
to keep R=3 copies of each piece of data in the database, and not use RAID to
improve reliability. The key goal we were shooting for was a database which
degrades gracefully when there are many small failures over time, without
needing human intervention.Why don't we like RAID for big NoSQL databases?Most
big storage systems use RAID levels like 3, 4, 5, or 10 to improve
reliability. A conservativ</p><p>4 0.97608221 <a title="538-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-25-The_Anatomy_of_Search_Technology%3A_blekko%E2%80%99s_NoSQL_database.html">1233 high scalability-2012-04-25-The Anatomy of Search Technology: blekko’s NoSQL database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post (part 2,part 3) by Greg Lindahl, CTO of blekko, the spam
free search engine that had over 3.5 million unique visitors in March. Greg
Lindahl was Founder and Distinguished Engineer at PathScale, at which he was
the architect of the InfiniPath low-latency InfiniBand HCA, used to build
tightly-coupled supercomputing clusters.Imagine that you're crazy enough to
think about building a search engine.  It's a huge task: the minimum index
size needed to answer most queries is a few billion webpages. Crawling and
indexing a few billion webpages requires a cluster with several petabytes of
usable disk -- that's several thousand 1 terabyte disks -- and produces an
index that's about 100 terabytes in size.Serving query results quickly
involves having most of the index in RAM or on solid state (flash) disk. If
you can buy a server with 100 gigabytes of RAM for about $3,000, that's 1,000
servers at a capital cost of $3 million, plus about $1 million per year of
server co-locatio</p><p>5 0.97503728 <a title="538-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-25-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_25th%2C_2014.html">1637 high scalability-2014-04-25-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 25th, 2014</a></p>

Quotes:@jimplush: Google spent 2.3 billion on infrastructure in Q1. Remember
that when you say you want to be "the Google of something"Clay Shirky: I think
one of the things that happened to the P2P market for infrastructure is that
users preference for predictable pricing vs resource-sensitive pricing is so
overwhelming that they will overpay to anyone who can promise flat prices. And
because the logic of centralization vs decentralization is so price sensitive,
I don't think there is any logical reason to assume a broadly stable class of
apps, separate from current pricing data for energy, cycles, and
storage.@chipchilders: Stop freaking making new projects just for the sake of
loose coupling.

[sent-20, score-0.735]
</p><p>2 For now we'll just address the memory based architecture part of the question, the cloud component is covered a little later. [sent-21, score-0.566]
</p><p>3 Memory is the System of Record  What makes Memory Based Architectures different from traditional architectures is that  memory is the system of record . [sent-33, score-0.491]
</p><p>4 The purpose behind cache based architectures is to minimize the data bottleneck through to disk. [sent-41, score-0.472]
</p><p>5 The dramatic drop of RAM prices along with the ability of servers to handle larger and larger amounts of RAM has caused memory architectures to verge on going mainstream. [sent-45, score-0.426]
</p><p>6 As an architecture it combines the holy quadrinity of computing:    Performance is better because data is accessed from memory instead of through a database to a disk. [sent-61, score-0.522]
</p><p>7 Reading data from memory is also faster than reading data from disk. [sent-68, score-0.499]
</p><p>8 Terracotta  - Terracotta is network-attached memory that allows you  share memory and do anything  across a cluster. [sent-104, score-0.514]
</p><p>9 Operates as an in-memory data grid that dynamically caches, partitions, replicates, and manages application data and business logic across multiple servers. [sent-108, score-0.416]
</p><p>10 And there are other architectures that will exploit memory yet won't be classic IDMG. [sent-112, score-0.426]
</p><p>11 But the speed of memory versus disk also allows entire new levels of performance and reliability in a relatively simple and easy to understand and deploy package. [sent-130, score-0.485]
</p><p>12 I've probably said this before, but the cloud is a new computing platform that some have learned to exploit, others are scrambling to master, but most people will see as nothing but a minor variation on what they're already doing. [sent-140, score-0.414]

</p><p>16 The reason that databases are important to cloud computing is that virtually all applications involve the interaction of client data with a shared, persistent data store. [sent-150, score-0.65]
</p><p>17 What I'm arguing is that a cloud is a different platform, and what works well for a single computer doesn't work at all well in cloud, and things that work well in a cloud don't work at all on the single computer system. [sent-159, score-0.638]

<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great scalability solution, but caching also  comes with problems .  Sharding  is a great scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in a  post-mortem  about their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database Foursquare uses, also contributed their  post-mortem  of what went wrong too.
 
Now that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?
 
First, like for  Facebook , huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in a pretty cool industry.
 
Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built by a small group of people, under immense pressure</p><p>5 0.2408561 <a title="538-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-07-Startups_are_Creating_a_New_System_of_the_World_for_IT.html">1240 high scalability-2012-05-07-Startups are Creating a New System of the World for IT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear?

<p>Introduction: A non-random sample of my tech friends shows that not many have heard of  memristors  (though I do suspect vote tampering). I'd read a little about memristors in  2008  when the initial hubbub about the existence of memristors was raised. I, however,  immediately filed them into that comforting conceptual bucket of potentially revolutionary technologies I didn't have to worry about because like most wondertech, nothing would ever come of it. Wrong. After watching  Finding the   Missing  Memristor  by R. Stanley Williams I've had to change my mind. Memristors have gone from "maybe never" to holy cow this could happen soon and it could change everything.
 
Let's assume for the sake of dreaming memristors do prove out. How will we design systems when we have access to a new material that is two orders of magnitude more efficient from a power perspective than traditional transistor technologies, contains multiple petabits (1 petabit = 128TB) of persistent storage, and can be reconfigured t</p><p>4 0.82453531 <a title="538-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-02-Using_the_Ambient_Cloud_as_an_Application_Runtime.html">786 high scalability-2010-03-02-Using the Ambient Cloud as an Application Runtime</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my article  Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.   
 
The future looks many, big, complex, and adaptive:
  
 Many clouds.  
 Many servers.  
 Many operating systems.  
 Many languages.  
 Many storage services.  
 Many database services.  
 Many software services.  
 Many adjunct human networks (like Mechanical Turk).  
 Many fast interconnects.  
 Many CDNs.  
 Many cache memory pools.  
 Many application profiles (simple request-response, live streaming, computationally complex, sensor driven, memory intensive, storage intensive, monolithic, decomposable, etc).  
 Many legal jurisdictions. Don't want to perform a function on Patriot Act "protected" systems then move the function elsewhere.  
 Many SLAs.

<p>Introduction: Two forces account for the trend of moving behavior to data: larger values used in key-value stores and spotty cloud networks. For some time we've seen functions pushed close to data with MapReduce, which is a batch process, but we are now seeing this model extend to interactive applications, which match the current emphasis on highly scalable, real-time, event driven applications.
 
To see the trend look at the increasing support for collocated behavior at the datastore level:
  
 HBase is implementing a  coprocessor feature . 
 Cassandra is also implementing  coprocessors or plugins . 
 Membase is creating  NodeCode , which is a process for executing functions on data in the database. 
 MongoDB supports  JavaScript stored procedures .  
 VoltDB has  Java based stored procedures . 
  In-memory DataGrid  products like GigaSpaces have been doing something like this forever. The key difference historically being GigaSpaces' tight integration with languages C++ and Java, instead of using</p><p>6 0.82432485 <a title="538-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-24-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_24%2C_2012.html">1198 high scalability-2012-02-24-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 24, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In   NoSQL: Past, Present, Future    Eric Brewer  has a particularly fine section on explaining the often hard to understand ideas of   BASE   (Basically Available, Soft State, Eventually Consistent),   ACID   (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability),   CAP   (Consistency Availability, Partition Tolerance), in terms of a pernicious long standing myth about the sanctity of consistency in banking.
    Myth   : Money is important, so banks   must   use transactions to keep money safe and consistent, right? 
    Reality   : Banking transactions are inconsistent, particularly for ATMs. ATMs are designed to have a normal case behaviour and a partition mode behaviour. In partition mode Availability is chosen over Consistency. 
   Why?   1)  Availability correlates with revenue and consistency generally does not.  2)  Historically there was never an idea of perfect communication so everything was partitioned.

<p>Introduction: This is the third guest post  (  part 1  ,   part 2  ) of a series by Greg Lindahl, CTO of blekko, the spam free search engine. Previously, Greg was Founder and Distinguished Engineer at PathScale, at which he was the architect of the InfiniPath low-latency InfiniBand HCA, used to build tightly-coupled supercomputing clusters. 
 
blekko's home-grown NoSQL database was designed from the start to support a web-scale search engine, with 1,000s of servers and petabytes of disk. Data replication is a very important part of keeping the database up and serving queries.  Like many NoSQL database authors, we decided to keep R=3 copies of each piece of data in the database, and not use RAID to improve reliability. The key goal we were shooting for was a database which degrades gracefully when there are many small failures over time, without needing human intervention.
  Why don't we like RAID for big NoSQL databases?  
Most big storage systems use RAID levels like 3, 4, 5, or 10 to improve relia</p><p>4 0.97608221 <a title="538-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-25-The_Anatomy_of_Search_Technology%3A_blekko%E2%80%99s_NoSQL_database.html">1233 high scalability-2012-04-25-The Anatomy of Search Technology: blekko’s NoSQL database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post ( part 2 ,  part 3 ) by Greg Lindahl, CTO of blekko, the spam free search engine that had over 3.5 million unique visitors in March. Greg Lindahl was Founder and Distinguished Engineer at PathScale, at which he was the architect of the InfiniPath low-latency InfiniBand HCA, used to build tightly-coupled supercomputing clusters. 
 
Imagine that you're crazy enough to think about building a search engine.  It's a huge task: the minimum index size needed to answer most queries is a few billion webpages. Crawling and indexing a few billion webpages requires a cluster with several petabytes of usable disk -- that's several thousand 1 terabyte disks -- and produces an index that's about 100 terabytes in size.
 
Serving query results quickly involves having most of the index in RAM or on solid state (flash) disk. If you can buy a server with 100 gigabytes of RAM for about $3,000, that's 1,000 servers at a capital cost of $3 million, plus about $1 million per year of serve</p><p>5 0.97503728 <a title="538-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-25-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_25th%2C_2014.html">1637 high scalability-2014-04-25-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 25th, 2014</a></p>

  @jimplush : Google spent 2.3 billion on infrastructure in Q1. Remember that when you say you want to be "the Google of something" 
 Clay Shirky: I think one of the things that happened to the P2P market for infrastructure is that users preference for predictable pricing vs resource-sensitive pricing is so overwhelming that they will overpay to anyone who can promise flat prices. And because the logic of centralization vs decentralization is so price sensitive, I don't think there is any logical reason to assume a broadly stable class of apps, separate from c</p><p>6 0.97042769 <a title="538-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-07-What_Google_App_Engine_Price_Changes_Say_About_the_Future_of_Web_Architecture.html">1112 high scalability-2011-09-07-What Google App Engine Price Changes Say About the Future of Web Architecture</a></p>

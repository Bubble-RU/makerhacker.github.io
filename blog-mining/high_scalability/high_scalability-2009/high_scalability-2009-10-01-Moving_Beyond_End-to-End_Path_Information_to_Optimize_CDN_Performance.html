</p><p>7 In this paper, we analyze latencies measured from servers in Google’s content distribution network (CDN) to clients all across the Internet to study the effectiveness of latency-based server selection. [sent-11, score-0.549]
</p><p>8 Our main result is that redirecting every client to the server with least latency does not suffice to optimize client latencies. [sent-12, score-0.499]

<p>Introduction: I had a false beliefI thought I came here to stayWe're all just visitingAll
just breaking like wavesThe oceans made me, but who came up with me?Push me,
pull me, push me, or pull me out .So true Perl Jam(Push me Pull me lyrics), so
true. I too have wondered how web clients should be notified of model changes.
Should servers push events to clients or should clients pull events from
servers? A topic worthy of its own song if ever there was one.breakTo pull
events the client simply starts a timer and makes a request to the server.
This is polling. You can either pull a complete set of fresh data or get a
list of changes. The server "knows" if anything you are interested in has
changed and makes those changes available to you. Knowing what has changed can
be relatively simple with a publish-subscribe type backend or you can get very
complex with fine grained bit maps of attributes and keeping per client state
on what I client still needs to see.Polling is heavy man. Imagine all your

<p>Introduction: This strategy is stated perfectly by Flickr's Myles Grant:The Flickr
engineering team is obsessed with making pages load as quickly as possible. To
that end, weâ&euro;&trade;re refactoring large amounts of our code to do only the essential
work up front, and rely on our queuing system to do the rest.Flickr uses a
queuing system to process 11 million tasks a day. Leslie Michael Orchard also
does a great job explaining the queuing meme in his excellent postQueue
everything and delight everyone. Asynchronous work queues are how you scalably
solve problems that are too big to handle in real-time.The process:Identify
the minimum feedback the client (UI, API) needs to know an operation
succeeded. It's enough, for example, to update a client's view when a posting
a message to a microblogging service. The client probably isn't aware of all
the other steps that happen when a message is added and doesn't really care
when they happen as long as the obvious cases happen in an appropariate period
of time.Queue</p><p>6 0.091478013 <a title="712-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-12-Google%3A_Taming_the_Long_Latency_Tail_-_When_More_Machines_Equals_Worse_Results.html">1207 high scalability-2012-03-12-Google: Taming the Long Latency Tail - When More Machines Equals Worse Results</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If a large number of leaf node machines send requests to a central root node
then that root node can become overwhelmed:The CPU becomes a bottleneck, for
either processing requests or sending replies, because it can't possibly deal
with the flood of requests.The network interface becomes a bottleneck because
a wide fan-in causes TCP drops and retransmissions, which causes latency. Then
clients start retrying requests which quickly causes a spiral of death in an
undisciplined system.One solution to this problem is a strategy given by Dr.
Jeff Dean, Head of Google's School of Infrastructure Wizardry, in this
Stanford video presentation:Tree Distribution of Requests and
Responses.Instead of having a root node connected to leaves in a flat
topology, the idea is to create a tree of nodes. So a root node talks to a
number of parent nodes and the parent nodes talk to a number of leaf nodes.
Requests are pushed down the tree through the parents and only hit a subset of
the leaf nodes.With this</p><p>3 0.67620111 <a title="712-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-12-Google%3A_Taming_the_Long_Latency_Tail_-_When_More_Machines_Equals_Worse_Results.html">1207 high scalability-2012-03-12-Google: Taming the Long Latency Tail - When More Machines Equals Worse Results</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Likewise the current belief that, in the case of artificial machines the very
large and the very small are equally feasible and lasting is a manifest error.
Thus, for example, a small obelisk or column or other solid figure can
certainly be laid down or set up without danger of breaking, while the large
ones will go to pieces under the slightest provocation, and that purely on
account of their own weight. -- GalileoGalileo observed how things broke if
they were naively scaled up. Interestingly, Google noticed a similar pattern
when building larger software systems using the same techniques used to build
smaller systems. Luiz Andre Barroso, Distinguished Engineer at Google, talks
about this fundamental property of scaling systems in his fascinating talk,
Warehouse-Scale Computing: Entering the Teenage Decade. Google found the
larger the scale the greater the impact of latency variability. When a request
is implemented by work done in parallel, as is common with today's service

<p>Introduction: Update:Offloading ALL JS Files To Google. Now you can let Google serve all
your javascript files. This article tells you how to do it (upload to Google
Code Project) and why it's a big win (cheap, fast, caching, parallel
downloads, save bandwidth).Don't have a CDN? Why not let Google and Yahoo be
your CDN? At least for Ajax libraries. No charge. Google runs acontent
distribution network and loading architecture for the most popular open source
JavaScript libraries, which include: jQuery, prototype, script.aculo.us,
MooTools, and dojo. The idea is web pages directly include your library of
choice from Google's global, fast, and highly available network. Some have
found much better performance and others experienced slower performance. My
guess is the performance may be slower if your data center is close to you,
but far away users will be much happier. Some negatives: not all libraries are
included, you'll load more than you need because all functionality is
included. Yahoo has had asim</p><p>5 0.66384393 <a title="712-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-25-Latency_is_Everywhere_and_it_Costs_You_Sales_-_How_to_Crush_it.html">661 high scalability-2009-07-25-Latency is Everywhere and it Costs You Sales - How to Crush it</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 8:The Cost of Latency by James Hamilton. James summarizing some latency
info from Steve Souder,Greg Linden, andMarissa Mayer. Speed [is] an
undervalued and under-discussed asset on the web.Update 7:How do you know when
you need more memcache servers?. Dathan Pattishall talks about using memcache
not to scale, but to reduce latency and reduce I/O spikes, and how to use
stats to know when more servers are needed.Update 6:Stock Traders Find Speed
Pays, in Milliseconds. Goldman Sachs is making record profits off a500
millisecondtrading advantage. Yes, latency matters. As an interesting aside,
Libet found 500 msecs is about the time it takes the brain to weave together
an experience of consciousness from all our sensor inputs.Update 5:Shopzilla's

<p>Introduction: You go through the expense of installing CDNs all over the globe to make sure
users always have a node close by and you notice something curious and
furious: clients still experience poor latencies. What's up with that? What do
you do to find the problem? If you are Google you build a tool (WhyHigh) to
figure out what's up. This paper is about the tool and the unexpected problem
ofhigh latencieson CDNs. The main problems they found: inefficient routing to
nearby nodes and packet queuing. But more useful is the architecture of
WhyHigh and how it goes about identifying bottle necks. And even more useful
is the general belief in creating sophisticated tools to understand and
improve your service. That's what professionals do. From the
abstract:Replicating content across a geographically distributed set of
servers and redirecting clients to the closest server in terms of latency has
emerged as a common paradigm for improving client performance. In this paper,
we analyze latencies measured</p><p>3 0.84755111 <a title="712-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-29-HighScalability_Rated_%233_Blog_for_Developers.html">642 high scalability-2009-06-29-HighScalability Rated #3 Blog for Developers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: My apologies if you were looking for a post about cell phones. This post is
about high density nanodevices. It's a follow up toHow will memristors change
everything? for those wishing to pursue these revolutionary ideas in more
depth. This is one of those areas where if you are in the space then there's a
lot of available information and if you are on the outside then it doesn't
even seem to exist. Fortunately, Ben Chandler from The SyNAPSE Project, was
kind enough to point me to a great set of presentations given at the12th IEEE
CNNA - International Workshop on Cellular Nanoscale Networks and their
Applications- Towards Megaprocessor Computing. WARNING: these papers contain
extreme technical content. If you are like me and you aren't an electrical
engineer, much of it may make a sort of surface sense, but the deep and twisty
details will fly over head. For the more software minded there are a couple
more accessible presentations:Intelligent Machines built with Memristive

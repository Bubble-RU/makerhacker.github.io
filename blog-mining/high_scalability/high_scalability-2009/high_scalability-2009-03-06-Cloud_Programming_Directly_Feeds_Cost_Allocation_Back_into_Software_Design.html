</p><p>6 A clumsy name I know, but it is explained like this: If you are going to be charged for an operation GAE wants you to explicitly ask for it. [sent-17, score-0.326]
</p><p>7 This is why some automatic navigation between objects isn't provided because that will force an explicit query to be written. [sent-18, score-0.605]
</p><p>8 Writing an explicit query is a sort of EULA for being charged. [sent-19, score-0.427]
</p><p>9 Click OK in the form of a query and you've indicated that you are prepared to pay for a database operation. [sent-20, score-0.179]
</p><p>10 Listening to the Google folks talk about how one of their explicit design goals was to require programmers to be mindful of operations that will cost money made me realize in cloud programming cost will be another aspect of design we'll have to factor in. [sent-22, score-1.437]
</p><p>11 Instead of asking for theBig Ocomplexity of an algorithm we'll also have to ask for theBig $(or Big Euro) notation so we can judge an algorithm by its cost against a particular cloud profile. [sent-23, score-1.209]

</p><p>14 The dollar cost of software design isn't usually an explicit factor considered. [sent-30, score-0.958]
</p><p>15 Now software design decisions are part of the operations budget. [sent-31, score-0.222]
</p><p>16 Every algorithm decision you make will have dollar cost associated with it and it may become more important to craft algorithms that minimize operations cost across a large number of resources (CPU, disk, bandwidth, etc) than it is to trade off our old friends space and time.

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.We tend to think compute
of resources as residing primarily in datacenters. Given the fast pace of
innovation we will likely see compute resources become pervasive. Some will
reside in datacenters, but compute resources can be anywhere, not just in the
datacenter, we'll actually see the bulk of compute resources live outside of
datacenters in the future.Given the diversity of compute resources it's
reasonable to assume they won't be homogeneous or conform to a standard API.
They will specialize by service. Programmers will have to use those
specialized service interfaces to build applications that are adaptive enough
to take advantage of whatever leverage they can find, whenever and wherever
they can find it. Once found the application will have to reorganize on the
fly to use whatever new resources it has found and let go of whatever
resources it doesn't have</p><p>6 0.14485243 <a title="527-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-16-Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_in_the_Ambient_Cloud.html">750 high scalability-2009-12-16-Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: How do you scale a viral Facebook app that has skyrocketed to a mind boggling
65 million installs (the population of France)? That's the fortunate
problemBuddyPokeco-founder Dave Westwood has and he talked about his solution
at Wednesday'sFacebook Meetup. Slides for the complete talk arehere. For those
not quite sure what BuddyPoke is, it's a social network application that lets
users show their mood, hug, kiss, and poke their friends through on-line
avatars.In many ways BuddyPoke is the quintessentially modern web application.
It thrives off the energy of social network driven ecosystems. Game play
mechanics, viral loops, and creative monetization strategies are all part of
if its everyday conceptualization. It mashes together different technologies,
not in a dark Frankensteining sort of way, but in a smart way that gets the
most bang for the buck. Part of it runs on Facebook servers (free). Part of it
runs on flash in a browser (free). Part of it runs on a storage cloud (higher
cost)</p><p>4 0.79164225 <a title="527-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-21-Google_AppEngine_-_A_Second_Look.html">517 high scalability-2009-02-21-Google AppEngine - A Second Look</a></p>

free swag the attendees rake in, it's great of Google to make these videos
available so quickly after the conference. Let's say you don't want to watch
all the videos on the pretense you have a life, here are just a dozen

Two parts: how App Engine scales internally and how you as a programmer make
it scale using the tools. Good discussion of scaling and why it's hard; 10,000
queries per second is a large app that needs good architecting; a good
discussion of GAE's predictive scaling formula of how it decides when to spawn
instances;</p><p>6 0.72724086 <a title="527-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-01-Khan_Academy_Checkbook_Scaling_to_6_Million_Users_a_Month_on_GAE.html">1432 high scalability-2013-04-01-Khan Academy Checkbook Scaling to 6 Million Users a Month on GAE</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Making the world's knowledge computableToday's Wolfram|Alpha is the first step
in an ambitious, long-term project to make all systematic knowledge
immediately computable by anyone. You enter your question or calculation, and
Wolfram|Alpha uses its built-in algorithms and growing collection of data to
compute the answer.Answer Engine vs Search EngineWhenWolfram|Alphalaunches
later today, it will beone of the most computationally intensive websites on
the internet. TheWolfram|Alpha computational knowledge engineis an "answer
engine" that is able to produce answers to various questions such asWhat is

<p>Introduction: Update 6:CARS = Cost Aware Runtimes and Services by William Louth.Update
5:Damn You Google, Damn You Yahoo! Why D'Ya Do This to Us? Free accounts on a
cloud platform are a constant drain of money.Update 4:Caching becomes even
more important inCPU based billing environments. Avoiding the CPU means saving
money.Update 3:An interesting simple example of this idea showed up on the
Google AppEngine list. With one paging algorithm and one use of AJAX the
yearly cost of the site was $1000. By changing those algorithms the site went
under quota and became free again. This will make life a lot more interesting
for developers.Update 2:Business Model Influencing Software Architectureby

<p>Introduction: If you want to adopt a shard architecture, but don't want to start from
scratch, you may want to consider Hibernate's sharding system.Hibernate Shards
is a framework that is designed to encapsulate and minimize this complexity by
adding support for horizontal partitioning to Hibernate Core.Hibernate
Shardskey features:Standard Hibernate programming model - Hibernate Shards
allows you to continue using the Hibernate APIs you know and love:
SessionFactory, Session, Criteria, Query. If you already know how to use
Hibernate, you already know how to use Hibernate Shards.Flexible sharding
strategies - Distribute data across your shards any way you want. Use one of
the default strategies we provide or plug in your own application-specific
logic.Support for virtual shards - Think your sharding strategy is never going
to change? Think again. Adding new shards and redistributing your data is one
of the toughest operational challenges you will face once you've deployed your

<p>Introduction: A lot of new internet TV station startups are in the wind these days and
there's a question about how they can scale their broadcasts. Today's state of
the art shows you can't yet mimic the reach of broadcast TV with internet
tech. But as Oprah proves, you can still capture a lot of eyeballs, if you are
Oprah...Oprah drew a stunning 500,000 simultaneous viewers for an Eckhart
Tolle webcast. Move Networks and Limelight Networks hosted the "broadcast"
where traffic peaked at 242Gbps. A variable bitrate scheme was used so
depending on their connection, a viewer could have seen 150Kbps or as high as
750Kbps.Dan Rayburn thinksThe big take away from this webcast is that it shows
proof that the Internet is not built to handle TV like distribution and those
who think that live TV shows will be broadcast on the Internet with millions
and millions of people watching, it's just not going to happen.breakTo handle
more users comments suggested capping the bitrate at 300K, using P2P
streaming, or us</p><p>5 0.80338323 <a title="527-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-16-What_tech_is_used_to_build_your_favorite_site%3F.html">66 high scalability-2007-08-16-What tech is used to build your favorite site?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Find out with Builtwith.com. It scans a site and guesses how the site is
built. I ran it on this site and it said: Apache, Windows, PHP, Adsense, RSS,
CSS, Javascript, and UTF-8 encoding. Correct, yet I think it should have
guessed Drupal was the CMS and it should have been able to determine which
AJAX library is used. Though it's kind of cool to see which sites use PHP and
other technologies.</p><p>6 0.78243673 <a title="527-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-16-The_5_Biggest_Ways_to_Boost_MySQL_Scalability.html">1099 high scalability-2011-08-16-The 5 Biggest Ways to Boost MySQL Scalability</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A superb explanation by Theo Schlossnagle of how to deploy a high availability load balanced system using mod backhand and  Wackamole . The idea is you don't need to buy expensive redundant hardware load balancers, you can make use of the hosts you already have to the same effect. The discussion of using peer-based HA solutions versus a single front-end HA device is well worth the read. Another interesting perspective in the document is to view load balancing as a resource allocation problem. There's also a nice discussion of the negative of effect of keep-alives on performance.</p><p>3 0.11584119 <a title="686-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-06-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_December_6th%2C_2013.html">1559 high scalability-2013-12-06-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For December 6th, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: What's the cost of downtime to your business?  $100,000 per hour, $1,000,000 or more? The recent Volcanic ash that has grounded European flights is estimated to be costing the airlines $200M a day. In the IT world, High Availability (HA) architectures allow for disaster recovery as well as uninterrupted business continuity during system failure.
 
This post focuses on a customer’s backend, comprised of a business application stack supported by a dozen Oracle databases. They wish to equip this infrastructure with HA features and ensure that outages do not cost business. How do we address the challenge of pricing the complete solution, with hardware, software, services and annual support?

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Ran Grushkowsky , Head of Technology at ATMCash. 
 
Virtualization and cloud-based systems are very hype in the industry; however, most financial companies stray from those solutions. At ATMCash, we’ve approached virtualization not for the usual reason of scalability, but for the usually missed value of security.
 
In this article, I will introduce the concept of security added value in the utilization of virtualization and why people should consider deploying mini-clouds for those use-cases. 
  How do virtual machines help mitigate risk?  
I am sure most of you have heard of the recent  hacking in the financial sector . Financial companies are under constant hacking attempts and security is of the utmost importance. One of the bigger risks in system deployment is a breach in one of the stack components. Regular system patches and maintenance fix known exploits and issues, however, sometimes it may be too late and the component has already been breached.

<p>Introduction: One of the cool things we are seeing is more tools and tool chains for performing very high level operations quite simply.  Vagrant  is such a tool for  building and distributing virtualized development environments .
  

Web developers use virtual environments every day with their web   applications. From EC2 and Rackspace Cloud to specialized solutions such   as EngineYard and Heroku, virtualization is the tool of choice for  easy  deployment and infrastructure management. Vagrant aims to take  those  very same principles and put them to work in the heart of the   application lifecycle. By providing easy to configure, lightweight,   reproducible, and portable virtual machines targeted at development   environments, Vagrant helps maximize your productivity and flexibility.

  
If you've created a build and deployment system before Vagrant does a lot of the work for you:

<p>Introduction: Warning, this post is a bit vendor FUDy, but SSL is an important topic and it does bring up some issues worth arguing about. Hacker News has a  good discussion  of the article. Adam Langley started it all with his article  Overclocking SSL  and has made a rebuttal to the F5 article in  Still not computationally expensive . 
 
 My car is eight years old this year. It has less than 30,000 miles on it. 
 
Yes, you heard that right, less than 30,000 miles. I don’t drive my car very often because, well, my commute is a short trip down two flights of stairs. I don’t need to go very far when I do drive it’s only ten miles or so round trip to the grocery store. So from my perspective, gas isn’t really very expensive. I may use a tank of gas a month, which works out to … well, it’s really not even worth mentioning the cost. But for someone who commutes every day – especially someone who commutes a long-distance every day – gas is expensive.

<p>Introduction: Jumping around the social mediasphere, it's not uncommon to feel the heat generated in praise of a favorite this or that over all the clearly inferior alternatives. Whilst human nature may never cool, I think Old Will had some insight worth considering the next time a flame threatens to flicker forth:
 
  My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun (Sonnet 130)  
  
 
 
 

 My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun; Coral is far more red than her lips' red ; If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head. I have seen roses damask, red and white, But no such roses see I in her cheeks; And in some perfumes is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. I love to hear her speak, yet well I know That music hath a far more pleasing sound; I grant I never saw a goddess go; My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground: And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare As any she belied with false compare.

<p>Introduction: Hey guys,  There is a renewed push at my organization to deploy vmware...everywhere.  I am rather excited as I know we have a lot of waste when it comes to resources.  What has pricked my ears up however, is the notion of using this technology in our very busy public facing DMZ's.  Today we get lots of spikes of traffic and we are coping very well.  40x HP blades, apache/php/perl/tomcat/ all in HA behind HA F5's and HA Checkpoint FW's.  (20 servers in 2 datacentres).  The idea is, we virtualise these machines, including the firewalls onto hosts vmware clusters that span the public interface to our internal networks.  This is something that has gone against the #1 rule I have ever lived by while working on the inet.  No airgaps from the unknown to the known!  I am interested in feedback on this scenario.  From a resource perspective, our resource requirements in the DMZ will be lowered over time due to business change and we still have a lot of head room in our capacity.  Do you think t</p><p>3 0.86785638 <a title="686-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-30-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_31%2C_2012.html">1315 high scalability-2012-08-30-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 31, 2012</a></p>

The Instagram team has written up what can be considered the canonical description of an early stage startup in this era:  What Powers Instagram: Hundreds of Instances, Dozens of Technologies .
 
Instagram uses a pastiche of different technologies and strategies. The team is small yet has experience rapid growth riding the crest of a rising social and mobile wave, it uses a hybrid of SQL and NoSQL, it uses a ton of open source projects, they chose the cloud over colo, Amazon services are highly leveraged rather than building their own, reliability is through availability zones, async work scheduling links components together, the system is composed as much as possible</p><p>3 0.63638896 <a title="522-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-08-How_UltraDNS_Handles_Hundreds_of_Thousands_of_Zones_and_Tens_of_Millions_of_Records.html">1335 high scalability-2012-10-08-How UltraDNS Handles Hundreds of Thousands of Zones and Tens of Millions of Records</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Jeffrey Damick , Principal Software Engineer for  Neustar .   Jeffrey has overseen the software architecture for  UltraDNS  for last two and half years as it went through substantial revitalization.  
 
UltraDNS is one the top the DNS providers, serving many  top-level domains (TLDs)  as well as  second-level domains (SLDs) .  This requires handling of several hundreds of thousands of zones with many containing millions of records each.  Even with all of its success UltraDNS had fallen into a rut several years ago, its release schedule had become haphazard at best and the team was struggling to keep up with feature requests in a waterfall development style.
  Development  
Realizing that something had to be done the team came together and identified the most important areas to attack first.  We began with the code base, stabilizing our flagship proprietary C++ DNS server, instituting common best practices and automation.   Testing was very manual and not easily</p><p>4 0.62828499 <a title="522-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-25-Great_Open_Source_Solution_for_Boring_HA_and_Scalability_Problems.html">1522 high scalability-2013-09-25-Great Open Source Solution for Boring HA and Scalability Problems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post about how boring and repetitive HA and scalability problems can be solved via Open Source so you can focus on the interesting tasks. The post was written by  Maarten Ectors , responsible for Cloud Strategy and  Frank Mueller , a Juju Core developer, at  Ubuntu / Canonical . 
 
High-availability and scalability are exciting in general but there are certain problems that experts see over and over again. The list is long but examples are setting up MySQL clustering, sharding Mongo, adding data nodes to a Hadoop cluster, monitoring with Ganglia, building continuous deployment solutions, integrating Memcached / Varnish / Nginx,… Why are we reinventing the wheel?
 
At Ubuntu we made it our goal to have the community solve these repetitive and often boring tasks. How often have you had to set-up MySQL replication and scale it? What if the next time you just simply do:

 juju deploy mysql mysql-slave

<p>Introduction: It's been a well kept secret, but you may have heard  Facebook will Buy Photo-Sharing Service Instagram for $1 Billion . Just what is Facebook buying? Here's a quick gloss I did a little over a year ago on a presentation Instagram gave on their architecture. In that article I called Instagram's architecture the " canonical description of an early stage startup in this era." Little did we know how true that would turn out to be. If you want to learn how they did it then don't take a picture, just keep on reading...

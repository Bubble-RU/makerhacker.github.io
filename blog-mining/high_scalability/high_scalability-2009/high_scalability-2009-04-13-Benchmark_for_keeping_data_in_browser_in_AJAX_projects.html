<p>Introduction: I've been using GWT for an application and I get the same feeling using it that I first got using html. I've always sucked at building UIs. Starting with programming HP terminals, moving on to the Apple Lisa, then X Windows, and Microsoft Windows, I just never had IT, whatever IT is. On the Beauty and the Geek scale my interfaces are definitely horned-rimmed and pocket protector friendly. Html helped free me from all that to just build stuff that worked, but didn't have to look all that great. Expectations were pretty low and I eagerly fulfilled them. With Ajax expectations have risen again and I find myself once more easily identifiable as a styless geek. Using GWT I have some hopes I can suck a little less.     In working with GWT I was so focussed on its tasty easily digestible Ajaxy goodness, I didn't stop to think about the topic of this site: scalability. When I finally brought my distracted mind around to consider the scalability of the single page webs site I was building, I be</p><p>3 0.17544451 <a title="565-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-18-Session_management_in_highly_scalable_web_sites.html">97 high scalability-2007-09-18-Session management in highly scalable web sites</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,     Every application server has its own session management implementations for supporting high scalability. But an application architect/developer has to design and implement the application to make the best use of it.     What are the guiding principles and pattern for session state management?     Websphere System management red book mentions that "Session management performance is optimum when session data per user is around 2Kb. It degrades if session data is more than that".     I have following questions.   1. How do you measure session data per user?   2. It is generally recommended that you should keep all the session state in database and keep only the keys in HttpSession object. Then everytime a web request is processed, session data is fetched from the database. This way all the data remains in memory only till the request is processed and actual data in HttpSession is very less. (Only few keys).   What is the general practice?   At what point you should be switching fr</p><p>4 0.16218035 <a title="565-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-16-Google%2B_Infrastructure_Update_-_the_JavaScript_Story.html">1143 high scalability-2011-11-16-Google+ Infrastructure Update - the JavaScript Story</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There have been reports that  software engineering is dead . Maybe, like the future, software engineering is simply not evenly distributed? When you read this paper I think you'll agree there is some real engineering going on, it's just that most of the things we need to build do not require real engineering. Much like my old childhood tree fort could be patched together and was "good enough." This brings to mind the old joke: If a software tree falls in the woods would anyone hear it fall? Only if it tweeted on the way down...  What this paper really showed me is we need not only to change programming practices and constructs, but we also need to design solutions that allow for deep parallelism to begin with. Grafting parallelism on later is difficult. Parallel execution requires knowing precisely how components are dependent on each other and that level of precision tends to go far beyond the human attention span.  In particular this paper deals with how to parallelize the browser on</p><p>6 0.13862205 <a title="565-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-16-What_tech_is_used_to_build_your_favorite_site%3F.html">66 high scalability-2007-08-16-What tech is used to build your favorite site?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: John McCutchan ,   after a long career spent working on the Linux kernel and being hired out as a code optimization guru, joined Google's Dart team. A curious hire until you watch  Bringing SIMD to the Web via Dart , where John makes a programmer accessible explanation of why he likes Dart: performance, performance, performance.  
    Dart    is an open-source Web programming language    developed by Google   . The motivation for Dart is twofold: provide a language capable of scaling up to the complex web applications that are becoming the norm. Think Gmail. And provide a single language capable of working on both the client and server. Towards those ends Dart is a complete language, full tool environment, and provides an advanced Web UI framework for building web applications at a high level of abstraction. 
   Why isn't JavaScript good enough? The fear is for large web apps the nature of JavaScript puts crippling limits on potential performance improvements, which will cause  web app</p><p>3 0.59991449 <a title="565-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-19-Serving_JavaScript_Fast.html">285 high scalability-2008-03-19-Serving JavaScript Fast</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cal Henderson  writes at thinkvitamin.com : "With our so-called "Web 2.0' applications and their rich content and interaction, we expect our applications to increasingly make use of CSS and JavaScript. To make sure these applications are nice and snappy to use, we need to optimize the size and nature of content required to render the page, making sure weâ&euro;&trade;re delivering the optimum experience. In practice, this means a combination of making our content as small and fast to download as possible, while avoiding unnecessarily refetching unmodified resources." A lot of good comments too.</p><p>4 0.58931804 <a title="565-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-29-20_New_Rules_for_Faster_Web_Pages.html">291 high scalability-2008-03-29-20 New Rules for Faster Web Pages</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:  Nice explanation in  The importance of bandwidth versus latency  of how long latencies cause cascading delays in resource loading.  Doloto  tries to optimize how resources are loaded.   Twenty new rules  have been added to the  original 14 rules  for sizzling web performance. Part of scalability is worrying about performance too. The front-end is where 80-90% of end-user response time is spent and following these best practices improved the performance of Yahoo! properties by 25-50%. The rules are divided into server, content, cookie, JavaScript, CSS, images, and mobile categories. The new rules are:
  Flush the buffer early  	[server]    Use GET for AJAX requests 	[server]    Post-load components 	[content]    Preload components 	[content]    Reduce the number of DOM elements 	[content]    Split components across domains 	[content]    Minimize the number of iframes 	[content]    No 404s 	[content]    Reduce cookie size 	[cookie]    Use cookie-free domains for components 	[coo</p><p>5 0.53556532 <a title="565-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-16-Google%2B_Infrastructure_Update_-_the_JavaScript_Story.html">1143 high scalability-2011-11-16-Google+ Infrastructure Update - the JavaScript Story</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Excellent article on using Hadoop in Amazon's services environment to solve real problems for very little money. It's excellent because it shows how the stack works together and it actually seems like something a real human could do.</p><p>same-blog 2 1.0 <a title="565-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-13-Benchmark_for_keeping_data_in_browser_in_AJAX_projects.html">565 high scalability-2009-04-13-Benchmark for keeping data in browser in AJAX projects</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,     We are using AJAX and see a lot of opportunity to keep session state on client browser with javascript objects.   Is there any benchmark about how much data you can generally keep in javascript objects in browser?     Thanks,   Unmesh</p><p>3 0.99950212 <a title="565-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-02-Strategy%3A_How_to_Manage_Sessions_Using_Memcached.html">436 high scalability-2008-11-02-Strategy: How to Manage Sessions Using Memcached</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dormando  shows an enlightened middle way  for storing sessions in cache and the database. Sessions are a perfect cache candidate because they are transient, smallish, and since they are usually accessed on every page access removing all that load from the database is a good thing. But as Dormando points out session caches have problems. If you remove expiration times from the cache and you run out of memory then no more logins. If a cache server fails or needs to be upgrade then you just logged out a bunch of potentially angry users.  The middle ground Dormando proposes is using both the cache and the database:
    Reads : read from the cache first, then the database. Typical cache logic.     Writes :  write to memcached every time, write to the database every N seconds (assuming the data has changed).   There's a small chance of data loss, but you've still greatly reduced the database load while providing reliability. Nice solution.</p><p>4 0.99886572 <a title="565-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-25-Google%3A_Introduction_to_Distributed_System_Design.html">223 high scalability-2008-01-25-Google: Introduction to Distributed System Design</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: Google added videos on   Cluster Computing and MapReduce . There are five lectures:  Introduction, MapReduce, Distributed File Systems, Clustering Algorithms, and Graph Algorithms  .     Advanced website design depends on deep distributed system design knowledge. Where do you get this knowledge? Try Google. They have a a whole   Code for Educators   program with tutorials and lectures on AJAX programming, distributed systems, and web security. Looks pretty nice.</p><p>5 0.99551612 <a title="565-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-04-Strategy%3A_Cache_Larger_Chunks_-_Cache_Hit_Rate_is_a_Bad_Indicator.html">836 high scalability-2010-06-04-Strategy: Cache Larger Chunks - Cache Hit Rate is a Bad Indicator</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Isn't the secret to fast, scalable websites to  cache everything ? Caching, if not the  secret sauce  of many a website, is it at least a popular condiment. But not so fast says Peter Zaitsev in  Beyond great cache hit ratio . The point Peter makes is that we read about websites like  Amazon  and  Facebook  that can literally make hundreds of calls to satisfy a user request. Even if you have an awesome cache hit ratio, pages can still be slow because making and processing all those requests takes time. The solution is to  remove requests all together . You do this by  caching larger blocks  so you have to make fewer requests. 
 
The post has a lot of good advice worth reading: 1) Make non cacheable blocks as small as possible, 2) Maximize amount of uses of the cache item, 3) Control invalidation, 4) Multi-Get.</p><p>6 0.99529332 <a title="565-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-12-Strategy%3A_Terminate_SSL_Connections_in_Hardware_and_Reduce_Server_Count_by_40%25.html">878 high scalability-2010-08-12-Strategy: Terminate SSL Connections in Hardware and Reduce Server Count by 40%</a></p>

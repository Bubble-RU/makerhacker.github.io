<p>Introduction: Update:Good Vibrationsby Radovan SemanÄ?ik. Lot's of interesting questions
about how Wave works, scalability, security, RESTyness, and so on.Google
Waveis a new communication and collaboration platform based on hosted XML
documents (called waves) supporting concurrent modifications and low-latency
updates. This platform enables people to communicate and work together in new,
convenient and effective ways. We will offer these benefits to users ofGoogle
Waveand we also want to share them with everyone else by making waves an open
platform that everybody can share. We welcome others to run wave servers and
become wave providers, for themselves or as services for their users, and to
"federate" waves, that is, to share waves with each other and with Google
Wave. In this way users from different wave providers can communicate and
collaborate using shared waves. We are introducing the Google Wave Federation
Protocol for federating waves between wave providers on the Internet.Hereare

<p>Introduction: With all the attention being paid these days to VDI (virtual desktop
infrastructure) and application virtualization and server virtualization andvirtualization it's easy to forget about network-based
application virtualization. But it's the one virtualization technique
youshouldn'tforget because it is a foundational technology upon which myriad
other solutions will be enabled.WHAT IS NETWORK-BASED APPLICATION
VIRTUALIZATION?This term may not be familiar to you but that's because since
its inception oh, more than a decade ago, it's always just been called "server
virtualization". After the turn of the century (I love saying that, by the
way) it was always referred to asservice virtualizationinSOAand XML circles.
With the rise of the likes of VMware and Citrix and Microsoft server
virtualization solutions, it's become impossible to just use the term "server
virtualization" and "service virtualization" is just as ambiguous so it seems
appropriate to give it a few more modif</p><p>5 0.1293945 <a title="727-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-09-Paper%3A_Container-based_Operating_System_Virtualization%3A_A_Scalable%2C_High-performance_Alternative_to_Hypervisors.html">147 high scalability-2007-11-09-Paper: Container-based Operating System Virtualization: A Scalable, High-performance Alternative to Hypervisors</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One stumbling block of the the great march towards virtualization is the
relatively poor performance of resource hungry applications like databases. We
are told to develop and test using VMs, but deploy without them. Which kind of
sucks IMHO. Maybe better virtualization technology can remove this split. This
paper talks about a different approach to virtualization called "container-
based" virtualization that can reportedly double the performance of
traditional hypervisor systems like Xen. It does this by trading isolation for
efficiency. Rather than maintaining complete isolation between VMs the
container approach shares resources between VMs and thus gives higher
performance while still guaranteeing strong fault, resource, and security
isolation. It's yet another battle in computing's endless war of creating and
destroying abstraction layers. I learned a lot from from this paper because of
how it compared and contrasted traditional hypervisor and container based
virtualization strate</p><p>6 0.11265816 <a title="727-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This and the next post will discuss how virtualization and cloud computing, as
we know it today, is only a small part of the solution for today's IT
inefficiencies. While new technologies and delivery models have made it much
simpler to manage the infrastructure, this is not where our core
inefficiencies lie. Virtualization principles must be extended to higher
levels of the application stack, to make it easier for all of us to manage,
tune and integrate applications. Otherwise we will continue to spend most of
our time on things that don't provide real value to the business.Read the full

<p>Introduction: It's called "east-west" networking, which when compared to its predecessor,
"north-south" networking, evinces images of maelstroms and hurricane winds and
tsunamis for some reason. It could be the subtle correlation between the
transformative shift this change in networking patterns has on the data center
with that of El Ni単o's transformative power upon the weather patterns across
the globe.Traditionally, data center networks have focused on North-South
network traffic. The assumption is that clients on the edge would mainly
communicate with servers at the core, rather than across the network to other
clients.But server virtualization changes all this, with servers, virtual
appliances and even virtual desktops scattered across the same physical
infrastructure. These environments are also highly dynamic, with workloads
moving to different physical locations on the network as virtual servers are
migrated (in the case of data center networks) and clients move about the
building (in the ca</p><p>5 0.70694757 <a title="727-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-21-The_Conspecific_Hybrid_Cloud.html">1212 high scalability-2012-03-21-The Conspecific Hybrid Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When you're looking to add new tank mates to an existing aquarium ecosystem,
one of the concerns you must have is whether a particular breed of fish is
amenable to conspecific cohabitants. Many species are not, which means if you
put them together in a confined space, they're going to fight. Viciously. To
the death. Responsible aquarists try to avoid such situations, so careful
attention to theconspecificityof animals is a must.Now, while in many respects
the data center ecosystem correlates well to an aquarium ecosystem, in this
case it does not. It's what you usually get, today, but its not actually the
best model. That's because what you want in the data center ecosystem -
particularly when it extends to include publiccloud computingresources - is
conspecificity in infrastructure.This desire and practice is being seen both
in enterprise data center decision making as well as in startups suddenly
dealing with massive growth and increasingly encountering performance
bottlenecks over w</p><p>6 0.70674914 <a title="727-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-11-The_interactive_cloud.html">702 high scalability-2009-09-11-The interactive cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Server farms achieve high scalability and high availability through server
load balancing, a technique that makes the server farm appear to clients as a
single server. In this two-part article, Gregor Roth explores server load
balancing architectures, with a focus on open source solutions. Part 1 covers
server load balancing basics and discusses the pros and cons of transport-
level server load balancing.The barrier to entry for many Internet companies
is low. Anyone with a good idea can develop a small application, purchase a
domain name, and set up a few PC-based servers to handle incoming traffic. The
initial investment is small, so the start-up risk is minimal. But a successful
low-cost infrastructure can become a serious problem quickly. A single server
that handles all the incoming requests may not have the capacity to handle
high traffic volumes once the business becomes popular. In such a situations
companies often start to scale up: they upgrade the existing infrastructure by</p><p>same-blog 3 0.98233724 <a title="727-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-25-Is_Your_Data_Really_Secured%3F.html">727 high scalability-2009-10-25-Is Your Data Really Secured?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Caching/data-grids are going through a similar evolution to databases. As with
databases, we started by using caching as an embedded service to the
application. Now we are in the phase where we need to be able to share the
data between multiple applications, or in cases where we don't want to share
the data, we need to be able to share the resources for managing the data,
while keeping a high degree of isolation.The demand for these sort of
requirements becomes much more common with SOA or SaaS-based applications. As
we approach the next generation of middleware and data-centers, it becomes
clear that we cannot move to the next wave of virtualization and cloud
computing without a strong security and isolation solution that is built-in to
all layers of our application and middleware.</p><p>4 0.97985071 <a title="727-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-22-How_many_machines_do_you_need_to_run_your_site%3F.html">70 high scalability-2007-08-22-How many machines do you need to run your site?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi,I am using drupal for my clients website, and was thinking is it possible
to host all ( about 500) of them on the same server(maybe VPS or
dedicated).Here is the situation..... Each clients website has a database with
about 50 tables each, all the databases are small in size about 2-5 MB ....
and the websites are low traffic websites with say.. 50 hits/day on avg....
that means about 2000 queries/db/day ..... (avg 40 queries per hit)....Wanted
to know if it is possible to have so many databases about 500 on the same
server?what are the things that i should look into if i should make this
happen?</p><p>6 0.97645986 <a title="727-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-10-Dealing_with_multi-partition_transactions_in_a_distributed_KV_solution.html">623 high scalability-2009-06-10-Dealing with multi-partition transactions in a distributed KV solution</a></p>

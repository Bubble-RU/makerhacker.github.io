<p>Introduction: Update: Erlang at Facebook by Eugene Letuchy. How Facebook uses Erlang to
implement Chat, AIM Presence, and Chat Jabber support. I've done
someXMPPdevelopment so when I readFacebook was making a Jabber chat clientI
was really curious how they would make it work. While core XMPP is
straightforward, a number of protocol extensions like discovery, forms, chat
states, pubsub, multi user chat, and privacy lists really up the
implementation complexity. Some real engineering challenges were involved to
make this puppy scale and perform. It's not clear what extensions they've
implemented, but a blog entry by Facebook's Eugene Letuchy hits some of the
architectural challenges they faced and how they overcame them.A web based
Jabber client poses a few problems because XMPP, like most IM protocols, is an
asynchronous event driven system that pretty much assumes you have a full time
open connection. After logging in the server sends a client roster information
and presence information.

<p>Introduction: Where do you draw the line between scalability vs Performance vs High
Availability vs Reliability?I guess at the end of the day, we all want to be
highly available, great performance and always reliable. So is it safe to say
that scalability is the answer ?Also when do you start to think scale out vs
scale up ?</p><p>5 0.086388029 <a title="740-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-30-Paper%3A_Dynamo%3A_Amazon%E2%80%99s_Highly_Available_Key-value_Store.html">139 high scalability-2007-10-30-Paper: Dynamo: Amazonâ€™s Highly Available Key-value Store</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2: Read/WriteWeb has a good article talking about the scalability
issues of relational databases and how Dynamo solves them:Amazon Dynamo: The
Next Generation Of Virtual Distributed Storage. But since Dynamo is just
another frustrating walled garden protected by barbed wire and guard dogs, its
relevance is somewhat overstated.Update:Greg Lindenhas a take on the paper
where he questions some of Amazon's design choices: emphasizing write
availability over fast reads, a lack of indexing support, use of random
distribution for load balancing, and punting on some scalability issues.Werner
Vogels, Amazon's avuncular CTO, just announced a newpaperon the internal
database technology Amazon uses to handle tens of millions customers. I'll
dive into more details later, but I thought you'd want to read it hot off the
blog. The bad news is it won't be a service. They are keeping this tech not so
secret, but very safe. Happily, it's another real-life example to learn from.

<p>Introduction: Submitted for your reading pleasure on this beautiful morning:  Group Decision
Making in Honey Bee Swarms. In distributed computing systems nodes reach
aquorum when deciding what to do as a group. It turns out bees also use quorum
logic when deciding on where to nest! Bees do it a bit differently of course:
A scout bee votes for a site by spending time at it, somehow the scouts act
and interact so that their numbers rise faster at superior sites, and somehow
the bees at each site monitor their numbers there so that they know whether
they've reached the threshold number (quorum) and can proceed to initiating
the swarm's move to this site.Ants use similar mechanisms to control foraging.
Distributed systems may share common mechanisms based on their nature as being
a distributed system,  the components may not matter that much.Fire! Fire!
Brent Chapman shows how to put that IT fire out in Incident Command for IT:

Bret Taylor says Friendfeed should have gone cloud, let others take the

packed interview on a wide range of cloud topics: Cloud Expert Inside theCube
at Stata Conference. Highlights: cloud is an operations model, it is not a
technology, it is a way to apply technology to problems; the faster you can
get the resources into the hands of the people who use it the more money you
save overall; cloud is a cash flow story, not a savings story; services aren't
about servers or storage, they are about applications.Quotable Quotes:Ryan

<p>Introduction: After Googlecut prices on their Google Cloud Platform Amazon quickly followed
with their ownprice cuts. Even more interesting is what the future holds for
pricing. The near future looks great. After that? We'll see.Adrian Cockcroft
highlights that Google thinksprices should followMoore's law, which means we
should expect prices to halve every 18-24 months.That's good news. Greater
cost certainty means you can make much more aggressive build out plans. With
the savings you can hire more people, handle more customers, and add those
media rich features you thought you couldn't afford. Design is directly
related to costs.Without Google competing with Amazon there's little doubt the
price reduction curve would be much less favorable.As a late cloud entrant
Google is now in a customer acquisition phase, so they are willing to pay for
customers, which means lower prices are an acceptable cost of doing business.
Profit and high margins are not the objective. Getting market share is what is

<p>Introduction: Gangliais a scalable distributed monitoring system for high-performance
computing systems such as clusters and Grids. It is based on a hierarchical
design targeted at federations of clusters. It leverages widely used
technologies such as XML for data representation, XDR for compact, portable
data transport, and RRDtool for data storage and visualization. It uses
carefully engineered data structures and algorithms to achieve very low per-
node overheads and high concurrency. The implementation is robust, has been
ported to an extensive set of operating systems and processor architectures,
and is currently in use on thousands of clusters around the world. It has been
used to link clusters across university campuses and around the world and can
scale to handle clusters with 2000 nodes.</p><p>6 0.52659315 <a title="740-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-08-Update_on_Scalable_Causal_Consistency_For_Wide-Area_Storage_With_COPS.html">1153 high scalability-2011-12-08-Update on Scalable Causal Consistency For Wide-Area Storage With COPS</a></p>

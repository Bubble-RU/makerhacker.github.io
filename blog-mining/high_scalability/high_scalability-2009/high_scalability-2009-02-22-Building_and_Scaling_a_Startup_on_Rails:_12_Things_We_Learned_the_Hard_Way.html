<p>Introduction: Update 6:  Some interesting changes from Twitter's  Evan Weaver : everything in RAM now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability; switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them locally.

  1. TWO-PHASE COMMIT  
Normally when data is changed in a database, it is written both to memory and to disk. When a commit happens, a relational database makes a commitment to freeze the data somewhere on real storage media. Remember, memory doesn't survive a crash or reboot. Even if the data is cached in memory, the database still has to write it to disk. MySQL binary logs or Oracle redo logs fit the bill.
 
With a MySQL cluster or distributed file system such as DRBD (Distributed Replicated Block Device) or Amazon Multi-AZ (Multi-Availability Zone), a commit occurs not only locally, but also at the remote end. A two-phase commit means waiting for an acknowledgment from the far end. Because of network and other latency, those commits can be slowed down by milliseconds, as though all the cars on a highway were slowe</p><p>4 0.10198129 <a title="518-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-02-Friends_for_Sale_Architecture_-_A_300_Million_Page_View-Month_Facebook_RoR_App.html">313 high scalability-2008-05-02-Friends for Sale Architecture - A 300 Million Page View-Month Facebook RoR App</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:  Jake in  Does Django really scale better than Rails?  thinks apps like FFS shouldn't need so much hardware to scale.  In a short three months Friends for Sale (think Hot-or-Not with a market economy) grew to become a top 10 Facebook application handling 200 gorgeous requests per second and a stunning 300 million page views a month. They did all this using Ruby on Rails,  two part time developers, a cluster of a dozen machines, and a fairly standard architecture. How did Friends for Sale scale to sell all those beautiful people? And how much do you think your friends are worth on the open market?

<p>Introduction: Pre-generating static files is an oldy but a goody, and as Thomas Brox RĂ¸st says, it's probably an underused strategy today. At one time this was the dominate technique for structuring a web site. Then the age of dynamic web sites arrived and we spent all our time worrying how to make the database faster and add more caching to recover the speed we had lost in the transition from static to dynamic.      Static files have the advantage of being very fast to serve. Read from disk and display. Simple and fast. Especially when caching proxies are used. The issue is how do you bulk generate the initial files, how do you serve the files, and how do you keep the changed files up to date? This is the process Thomas covers in his excellent article    Serving static files with Django and AWS - going fast on a budget"  , where he explains how he converted 600K thousand previously dynamic pages to static pages for his site   Eventseer.net  , a service for tracking academic events.

Club website; churn in core framework APIs make it more attractive to move than stay; supporting the structure of older versions of the site is an unsolved problem; the built-in Django admin saved a lot of work; group development is easier with "fewer specialized or hacked together pieces"; they use IRC for distributed development; sphinx for full-text search; nginx is the media server and reverse proxy; haproxy made the launch process a 5  second procedure; capistrano for deployment; clean component separation makes moving easier; Git for version control; ORM with complicated querysets is a performance problem; memcached for caching rendered pages; the CDN checks for updates every 10 minutes; videos, ar</p><p>5 0.6352669 <a title="518-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-28-A_Practical_Guide_to_Varnish_-_Why_Varnish_Matters.html">996 high scalability-2011-02-28-A Practical Guide to Varnish - Why Varnish Matters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Jeff Su  from Factual. 
 
 
  What is Varnish?  
 Varnish  is an open source, high performance http accelerator that sits in front of a web stack and caches pages.  This caching layer is very configurable and can be used for both static and dynamic content.
 
One great thing about Varnish is that it can improve the performance of your website without requiring any code changes.  If you haven’t heard of Varnish (or have heard of it, but haven’t used it), please read on.  Adding Varnish to your stack can be completely noninvasive, but if you tweak your stack to play along with some of varnish’s more advanced features, you’ll be able to increase performance by orders of magnitude.
 
Some of the high profile companies using Varnish include:  Twitter ,  Facebook ,  Heroku  and  LinkedIn .
  Our Use Case

<p>Introduction: Garry Tan, cofounder of Posterous, lists 12 lessons for scaling that apply to more than just Rails. 
  Use cloud storage for static files.   Use HTTP Cache Control to tell the browser what it can cache.   Use Sphinx for text search.   Use InnoDB for more crash resistant and faster writes.   Don't use textbook Rails ActiveRecord objects. Use New Relic to find exactly what is slow in your system.   Use memcache later so you find your database bottlenecks now.   Use mongrel proctitle to find your slow queries. You are only as fast as your slowest queries.   Use asynchronous job queuing to do work in parallel.    Use monitoring so you'll know when your site went down and why.   Learn by reading the source code, fixing problems, and submitting them back to the community.   Use new plugins. Old plugins can't be trusted.   Use new information. Old information can't be trusted.</p><p>2 0.63813961 <a title="518-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-25-Paper%3A_Lightweight_Web_servers.html">26 high scalability-2007-07-25-Paper: Lightweight Web servers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This paper is a great overview of different lightweight web servers. A lot of websites  use lightweight web servers to serve images and static content. YouTube is one example:  YouTube Architecture .
   
So if you need to improve performance consider changing over a different web server for some types of content.
 
Overview:   Recent years have enjoyed a florescence of interesting implementations of Web servers, including lighttpd, litespeed, and mongrel, among others. These Web servers boast different combinations of performance, ease of administration, portability, security, and related values. The following engineering study surveys the field of lightweight Web servers to help you find one likely to meet the technical requirements of your next project.  "Lightweight" Web servers like lighttpd, litespeed, and mongrel can offer dramatic benefits for your projects. This article surveys the possibilities and shows how they apply to you.

<p>Introduction: Im sure most are fami  l  iar w  i  th Facebooks 'news feed'. If not, the 'news feed' basica  l  ly lists recent activ  i  ty of all of your friends.     I dont see how you can get th  i  s information eff  i  ciently from a DB:         * Im assuming a  l  l user activity is inserted in a "actions" tab  l  e.       * first get a l  i  st of all your friends       * then query the act  i  ons table to return recent activ  i  ty where the activity belongs to someone on your friends list     This can't be eff  i  cient especially considering some people have 200+ friends.     So what am I m  i  ssing? How do you think Facebook is imp  l  ementing their "news feed".    Im not asking for any specific details, just a general point in the right direction, as I cant see how they are implementing the 'news feed efficient  l  y.   Thanks.</p><p>4 0.62763876 <a title="518-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-18-Building_your_own_Facebook_Realtime_Analytics_System__.html">1081 high scalability-2011-07-18-Building your own Facebook Realtime Analytics System  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Recently, I was reading Todd Hoff's write-up on  FaceBook real time analytics system  . As usual, Todd did an excellent job in summarizing  this video  from Engineering Manager at Facebook  Alex Himel .
 
In  the first post , I’d like to summarize the case study, and consider some things that weren't mentioned in the summaries. This will lead to an architecture for building your own Realtime Time Analytics for Big-Data that might be easier to implement, using Facebook's experience as a starting point and guide as well as the experience gathered through a recent work with few of GigaSpaces customers. The  second post  provide a summary of that new approach as well as a pattern and a demo for building your own Real Time Analytics system..

<p>Introduction: From  Wikipedia :     Hyperic  HQ is a popular open source IT Operations computer system and network monitoring application software. It auto-discovers all system resources and their metrics, including hardware, operating systems, virtualization, databases, middleware, applications, and services. It watches hosts and services that you specify, alerting you when things go bad and again when they get better. It also provides historical charting and event correlation for faster problem identification.    
 
 The Hyperic HQ server is a distributed J2EE application that runs on top of the open source JBoss Application Server. It is written in Java and portable C code and runs on Linux, Windows, Solaris, HP-UX and Mac OS X. Hyperic HQ Portal is a Java and AJAX User Interface that includes:  
 
 Inventory/Application Model & host hierarchy 
 Monitoring of network services (SMTP, POP3, HTTP, NNTP, ICMP, SNMP) 
 Monitoring of host resources (processor load, disk usage, system logs)

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-

<p>Introduction: Write a little "Hello World" program these days and it runs inside a
bewildering Russian Doll of nested environments, each layer adding its own
special performance and complexity tax. First, a language executes in its own
environment of data structure libraries, memory management, and so on. That,
more often than not, will run inside a language VM like the JVM, CLR, or V8.
The language VM will in-turn run inside a process that runs inside an OS. An
application will run in one or more threads inside a process. And the whole
thing will run inside a machine sharing VM layer like Xen. And across all of
that are frameworks for monitoring, elasticity, storage, and so on. That's a
lot of overhead for a such a little program.What if we could remove all these
taxes and run directly on the new bare metal, which some consider to be a
combination of Machine VM + Cloud API? That's exactly what a system
calledMirage, described in the paperTurning down the LAMP: Software

<p>Introduction: In some ways the original Amazon cloud, the one most of us still live in, was
like that really cool house that when you stepped inside and saw the oldgreen
shag carpetin the living room, you knew the house hadn't been updated in a
while. The network is a little slow, the processors are a bit dated, and
virtualization made the house just feel smaller. It has been difficult to run
high bandwidth or low latency workloads in the cloud. Bottlenecks everywhere.
Not a big deal for most applications, but for many high performance
applications (HPC) it was a killer.In a typical house you might just do a
remodel. Upgrade a few rooms. Swap out builder quality appliances with
gleaming stainless steel monsters. But Amazon has a big lot, instead of
remodeling they simply keep adding on entire new wings, kind of like the
Winchester Mystery Houseof computing.The first new wing added was aCPU based

<p>Introduction: The introduction of cloud technologies is not a simple evolution of existing
ones, but a real revolution.  Like all revolutions, it changes the points of
views and redefines all the meanings. Nothing is as before.  This post wants
to analyze some key words and concepts, usually used in traditional
architectures, redefining them according the standpoint of the cloud.
Understanding the meaning of new words is crucial to grasp the essence of a
pure cloud architecture.<>THOMAS REID, Essays on the
Intellectual Powers of ManNowadays, it is required to challenge the limits of
traditional architectures that go beyond the normal concepts of scalability
and support millions of users (What's Up 500 Million) billions of transactions
per day (Salesforce 1.3 billion), five 9s of availability (99.999 AOL).  I

<p>Introduction: Ezra Zygmuntowicz in a heart warming account of his4 Years at Engine Yard, has
concluded in his experience that:the true future of cloud computing for
developers is to not think about servers at all. It is now time to focus on
the Application and new levels of abstraction that allow folks to use the
computing resources in easier and easier ways. Tweets of
Gold:bryanlatten:Nothing like a million caching layers to screw up an already
complicated deployment. Thankfully, there is beer.jkalucki: Twitter isn't
down, you are just using the wrong access methods...andyedinborough: I don't
mean to hate, but why would I give up performance and scalability for a
dynamic language? Honestly, I don't get it.AsitSinha: It's amazing.... to see
the absence of an understanding of how capability plays a role in
scalability.scottgal: Devs are HORRIBLE DBAs. Used to do Scalability labs for
MS UK and bad schemas were the single biggest issue (next to bad

<p>Introduction: One of the cool things about Mr. Scoble is he doesn't pretend to know
everything, which can be an deadly boring affliction in this field. In this
case Robert is asking for help in an upcoming interview. Maybe we can help?
Here's Robert's plight:I’m really freaked out. I have one of the biggest
interviews of my life coming up and I’m way under qualified to host it.It’s on
Thursday and it’s about Scalability and Performance of Web Services.Look at
who will be on. Matt Mullenweg, founder of Automattic, the company behind
WordPress (and behind this blog). Paul Bucheit, one of the founders of
FriendFeed and the creator of Gmail (he’s also the guy who gave Google the
“don’t be evil” admonishion). Nat Brown, CTO of iLike, which got six million
users on Facebook in about 10 days.What would you ask?</p><p>2 0.92376584 <a title="694-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-21-Manage_virtualized_sprawl_with_VRMs.html">725 high scalability-2009-10-21-Manage virtualized sprawl with VRMs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The essence of my work is coming into daily contact with innovative
technologies. A recent example was at the request of a partner company who
wanted to answer- which one of these tools will best solve my virtualized
datacenter headache? After initial analysis all the products could be
classified as tools that troubleshoot VM sprawl, but there was no universally
accepted term for them. The most descriptive term  that I found was Virtual
Resource Manager (VRM) from DynamicOps. As I delved deeper into their
workings, the distinction between VRMs and Private Clouds became blurred. What
are the differences?Read more

<p>Introduction: If a large number of leaf node machines send requests to a central root node
then that root node can become overwhelmed:The CPU becomes a bottleneck, for
either processing requests or sending replies, because it can't possibly deal
with the flood of requests.The network interface becomes a bottleneck because
a wide fan-in causes TCP drops and retransmissions, which causes latency. Then
clients start retrying requests which quickly causes a spiral of death in an
undisciplined system.One solution to this problem is a strategy given by Dr.
Jeff Dean, Head of Google's School of Infrastructure Wizardry, in this
Stanford video presentation:Tree Distribution of Requests and
Responses.Instead of having a root node connected to leaves in a flat
topology, the idea is to create a tree of nodes. So a root node talks to a
number of parent nodes and the parent nodes talk to a number of leaf nodes.
Requests are pushed down the tree through the parents and only hit a subset of
the leaf nodes.With this</p><p>6 0.82366002 <a title="694-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-21-Paper%3A_Standardizing_Storage_Clusters_%28with_pNFS%29.html">128 high scalability-2007-10-21-Paper: Standardizing Storage Clusters (with pNFS)</a></p>

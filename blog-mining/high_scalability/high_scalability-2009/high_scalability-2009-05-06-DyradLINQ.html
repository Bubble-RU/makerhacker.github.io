<p>Introduction: Dryad is Microsoft's answer to Google's  map-reduce . What's the question: How do you process really large amounts of data? My initial impression of Dryad is it's like a giant Unix command line filter on steroids. There are lots of inputs, outputs, tees, queues, and merge sorts all connected together by a master exec program.  What else does Dryad have to offer the scalable infrastructure wars?
 
Dryad models programs as the execution of a directed acyclic graph. Each vertex is a program and edges are typed communication channels (files, TCP pipes, and shared memory channels within a process). Map-reduce uses a different model. It's more like a large distributed sort where the programmer defines functions for mapping, partitioning, and reducing.  Each approach seems to borrow from the spirit of its creating organization. The graph approach seems a bit too complicated and map-reduce seems a bit too simple. How ironic, in the Alanis Morissette sense.   Dryad is a middleware layer that ex</p><p>4 0.085452154 <a title="592-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-03-Paper%3A_G2_%3A_A_Graph_Processing_System_for_Diagnosing_Distributed_Systems.html">1136 high scalability-2011-11-03-Paper: G2 : A Graph Processing System for Diagnosing Distributed Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the problems in building distributed systems is figuring out what the heck is going on. Usually endless streams of log files are consulted like ancients using  entrails  to divine the will of the Gods.
 
To rise above these ancient practices we must rise another level of abstraction and that's the approach described in a Microsoft research paper:  G2: A Graph Processing System for Diagnosing Distributed Systems , which uses  execution graphs that model runtime events and their correlations in distributed systems .
 
The problem with these schemes is viewing applications, written by programmers in low level code, as execution graphs. But we're heading in this direction in any case. To program a warehouse or an internet sized computer we'll have to write at higher levels of abstraction so code can be executed transparently at runtime on these giant distributed computers. There are many advantages to this approach, fault diagnosis and performance monitoring are just one of the wins</p><p>5 0.06697832 <a title="592-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-06-Art_of_Distributed.html">590 high scalability-2009-05-06-Art of Distributed</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Art of Distributed   Part 1: Rethinking about distributed computing models  
I â&euro;&tilde;m getting a lot of questions lately about the distributed computing, especially distributed computing model, and MapReduce, such as: What is MapReduce? Can MapReduce fit in all situations? How we can compares it with other technologies such as Grid Computing? And what is the best solution to our situation? So I decide to write about the distributed computing article in two parts. First one about the distributed computing model and what is the difference between them. In the second part I will discuss the reliability, and distributed storage systems.   Download the article in PDF format.   Download the article in MS Word format.   I wait for your comments, and questions, and I will answer it in part two.</p><p>6 0.063081056 <a title="592-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud.html">40 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Contributed by Wolfgang Gentzsch:
 
Now that we have a new computing paradigm, Cloud Computing, how can Clouds help our data? Replace our internal data vaults as we hoped Grids would? Are Grids dead now that we have Clouds? Despite all the promising developments in the Grid and Cloud computing space, and the avalanche of publications and talks on this subject, many people still seem to be confused about internal data and compute resources, versus Grids versus Clouds, and they are hesitant to take the next step. I think there are a number of issues driving this uncertainty.

<p>Introduction: Alexey Radul in his fascinating 174 page dissertation  Propagation Networks: A Flexible and Expressive Substrate for Computation , offers to help us  break free of the tyranny of linear time by arranging computation as a network of autonomous but interconnected machines .  We can do this by  organizing computation as a network of interconnected machines of some kind, each of which is free to run when it pleases, propagating  information around the network as proves possible. The consequence of this freedom is that the structure of the aggregate does not impose an order of time.  The abstract from his thesis is : 
  In this dissertation I propose a shift in the foundations of computation. Modern programming systems are not expressive enough. The traditional image of a single computer that has global effects on a large memory is too restrictive. The propagation paradigm replaces this with computing by networks of local, independent, stateless machines interconnected with stateful storage</p><p>6 0.58457839 <a title="592-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-04-Is_MapReduce_going_mainstream%3F.html">401 high scalability-2008-10-04-Is MapReduce going mainstream?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Atif Ghaffar  has a nice strategy to deal with virus checking uploads:
   Upload item into a safe area. If necessary, the uploader blocks waiting for a result.    Queue a work order into a job system so all the work can be distributed throughout your cluster.    A service in your cluster performs the virus scan and informs the uploader of the result.    Move the vetted item into your system.  This removes the CPU bottleneck from your web servers and distributes it through your cluster.  Keep your web servers providing prompt service to users. Let your cluster do the heavy lifting. This minimizes response time and maximizes throughput. A similar system can be used for creating thumbnails, transcoding, copyright checks, updating indexes, event notification or any other kind of intensive work.</p><p>3 0.65650576 <a title="592-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-09-The_Story_of_How_Turning_Disk_Into_a_Service_Lead_to_a_Deluge_of_Density.html">1384 high scalability-2013-01-09-The Story of How Turning Disk Into a Service Lead to a Deluge of Density</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We usually think of the wonderful advantages of  service oriented architectures  as a software thing, but it also applies to hardware. In  Security Now 385 , that Doyen of Disk,  Steve Gibson , tells the fascinating story (@ about 41:30) of how moving to a service oriented architecture in hard drives, modeling a drive as a linear stream of sectors, helped create the amazing high density disk drives we enjoy today.
 
When drives switched to use the  IDE  (integrated drive electronics) interface, the controller function moved into the drive instead of the computer. No longer were low level drive signals moved across cables and into the motherboard. Now we just ask the drive for the desired sector and the drive takes care of it.
 
This allowed manufacturers to do anything they wanted to behind the IDE interface. The drive stopped being dumb, it became smart, providing a sort of sector service. Density sky rocketed because there was no dependency on the computer. All the internals could co</p><p>4 0.5925355 <a title="592-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-25-Colmux_-_Finding_Memory_Leaks%2C_High_I-O_Wait_Times%2C_and_Hotness_on_3000_Node_Clusters.html">1104 high scalability-2011-08-25-Colmux - Finding Memory Leaks, High I-O Wait Times, and Hotness on 3000 Node Clusters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Todd had originally posted an entry on  collectl  here at  Collectl - Performance Data Collector . Collectl collects real-time data from a large number of subsystems like buddyinfo, cpu, disk, inodes, infiniband, lustre, memory, network, nfs, processes, quadrics, slabs, sockets and tcp, all using one tool and in one consistent format.
 
Since then a lot has happened.  It's now part of both Fedora and Debian distros, not to mention several others. There has also been a pretty good summary written up by  Joe Brockmeier . It's also pretty well documented (I like to think) on  sourceforge . There have also been a few blog postings by   Martin Bach   on his blog.
 
Anyhow, awhile back I released a new version of collectl-utils and gave a complete face-lift to one of the utilities, colmux, which is a collectl multiplexor.  This tool has the ability to run collectl on multiple systems, which in turn send all their output back to colmux.  Colmux then sorts the output on a user-specified column</p><p>5 0.59062999 <a title="592-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-28-Strategy%3A_Guaranteed_Availability_Requires_Reserving_Instances_in_Specific_Zones.html">1165 high scalability-2011-12-28-Strategy: Guaranteed Availability Requires Reserving Instances in Specific Zones</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When EC2 first started the mental model was of a magic Pez dispenser supplying an infinite stream of instances in any desired flavor. If you needed an instance, because of a either a failure or traffic spike, it would be there. As amazing as EC2 is, this model turned out to be optimistic.  
 
From a  thread on the Amazon discussion forum  we learn any dispenser has limits:
  

As Availability Zones grow over time, our ability to continue to expand them can become constrained. In these scenarios, we will prevent customers from launching in the constrained zone if they do not yet have existing resources in that zone. We also might remove the constrained zone entirely from the list of options for new customers. This means that occasionally, different customers will see a different number of Availability Zones in a particular Region. Both approaches aim to help customers avoid accidentally starting to build up their infrastructure in an Availability Zone where they might have less ability</p><p>6 0.57008684 <a title="592-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-09-10_NoSQL_Systems_Reviewed.html">739 high scalability-2009-11-09-10 NoSQL Systems Reviewed</a></p>

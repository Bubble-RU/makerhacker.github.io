views/downloads of a set of resources, let them to be identified by their
respective URLs.This is not a big problem. I also need to keep a list of
viewed/downloaded resources in the last X days. This list needs to be updated
every now and then to reflect real last X days of usage. So resources that
were requested prior to X days get evicted from it.So it's sort of a black
box, you feed messages (download request) in and it gives you that list of
URLs with counters on the other end.How would you go about designing it?</p><p>4 0.46446711 <a title="489-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-10-Useful_Corporate_Blogs_that_Talk_About_Scalability.html">408 high scalability-2008-10-10-Useful Corporate Blogs that Talk About Scalability</a></p>

Disappointing, I know, but fear not, I will be posting some oldies for your
re-enjoyment.And If you've ever wanted to write an article for
HighScalability, this would be a great time :-) I especially need help on
writingStuff the Internet Says on Scalabilityas I will be reading the
Interwebs on a much reduced schedule. Shock! Horror! So if the spirit moves
you, please write something.My connectivity in Italy will probably be good, so
I will check in and approve articles on a regular basis. Ciao...</p><p>6 0.46105623 <a title="489-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-23-Gone_Fishin%27_2014.html">1653 high scalability-2014-05-23-Gone Fishin' 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Why migrate your database? Efficiency and availability problems are harming
your business - reports are out of date, your batch processing window is
nearing its limits, outages (unplanned/planned) frequently halt work. Database
consolidation - remove the costs that result from a heterogeneous database
environment (DBAs time, database vendor pricing, database versions, hardware,
OSs, patches, upgrades etc.). OK, so the driving forces for migration are
clear,  what now?ďťżRead more onBigDataMatters.com</p><p>3 0.69511729 <a title="489-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-14-Paper%3A_Pig_Latin%3A_A_Not-So-Foreign_Language_for_Data_Processing.html">443 high scalability-2008-11-14-Paper: Pig Latin: A Not-So-Foreign Language for Data Processing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yahoo has developed a new language called Pig Latin that fit in a sweet spot
between high-level declarative querying in the spirit of SQL, and low-level,
procedural programming `a la map-reduce and combines best of both worlds.The
accompanying system, Pig, is fully implemented, and compiles Pig Latin into
physical plans that are executed over Hadoop, an open-source, map-reduce
implementation. Pig has just graduated from the Apache Incubator and joined
Hadoop as a subproject.The paper has a few examples of how engineers at Yahoo!
are using Pig to dramatically reduce the time required for the development and
execution of their data analysis tasks, compared tousing Hadoop
directly.References:Apache Pig Wiki</p><p>4 0.69251627 <a title="489-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-17-Can_How_Bees_Solve_their_Load_Balancing_Problems_Help_Build_More_Scalable_Websites%3F.html">158 high scalability-2007-11-17-Can How Bees Solve their Load Balancing Problems Help Build More Scalable Websites?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Bees have a similar problem to website servers: how to do a lot of work with
limited resources in an ever changing environment. Usually lessons from
biology are hard to apply to computer problems. Nature throws hardware at
problems. Billions and billions of cells cooperate at different levels of
organizations to find food, fight lions, and make sure your DNA is passed
on.Nature's software is "simple," but her hardware rocks. We do the opposite.
For us hardware is in short supply so we use limited hardware and leverage
"smart" software to work around our inability to throw hardware at problems.
But we might be able to borrow some load balancing techniques from bees. What
do bees do that we can learn from?Bees do a dance to indicate the quality and
location of a nectar source. When a bee finds a better source they do a better
dance and resources shift to the new location. This approach may seem
inefficient, but it turns out to be "optimal for the unpredictable nectar
world." Craig Tovey</p><p>5 0.69044465 <a title="489-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-02-Some_Real_Financial_Numbers_for_Your_Startup.html">107 high scalability-2007-10-02-Some Real Financial Numbers for Your Startup</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are a startup you may find useful Guy Kawasaki's postFinancial Models
for Underachievers: Two Years of the Real Numbers of a Startup. Part of any
business plan are the projected guestimates. They are guestimates because
everyone keeps these numbers hidden like a Swiss bank account. But notRedfin.
They've bravely shared their initial cost projections, their actual numbers
from real life, and the lessons they've learned from the discrepancy between
the two...breakYou can find their model estimates and actuals for Rent, Per
Employee, Per Month (model: $250, actual: $336); Initial Per-Employee
Equipment Cost; Monthly Benefits, Per-Employee; Annual Payroll Tax; Quarterly
Bonus Payout, as a % of the Total Possible; Annual Payroll Increase for
Existing Employees; All-Company Meeting Cost, Per-Meeting, Per-Employee;
Annual Accounting Costs, and a few more.There is also a great lessons section:

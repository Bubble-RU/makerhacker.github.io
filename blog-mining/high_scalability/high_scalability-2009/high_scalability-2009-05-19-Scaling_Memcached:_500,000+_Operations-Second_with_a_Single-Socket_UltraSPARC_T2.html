<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add
cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case.
Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we
don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL
hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to
deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is
Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on
Fotolog inSecrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success, which was one of my personal
favorites.Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site
nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog
has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G
available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding
performance and scaling requirements. To meet those requirements they've
developed a soph</p><p>4 0.13339467 <a title="603-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-28-And_the_winner_is%3A_MySQL_or_Memcached_or_Tokyo_Tyrant%3F.html">729 high scalability-2009-10-28-And the winner is: MySQL or Memcached or Tokyo Tyrant?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matt, from the ever excellentMySQL Performance Blog, decided to run a test
using a simple scenario drawn from his client experience in the gaming space.
The scenario: read a row based on a primary key, update the row, write it to
disk, and use the row to lookup another row. Matt ran three different tests
explained in a series of three different articles:MySQL and MySQL + Memcached,
Memcached Only, andTokyo Tyrant.The lovingly compiled details along with many
cool graphs are in the articles, but in general the lessons learned are:When
memcached hasenough memory(so records being accessed are in RAM), memcached +
MySQL can provide a10x performance boostover MySQL alone. When the RAM is too
small and hot records, those being accessed a lot, aren't in RAM, or perhaps
applications are doing a sequential scan of a table and the entire table isn't
cached, then memcached won't be the big bang improvement you may be hoping
for.When the database is removed and memcached serves both reads and writ</p><p>5 0.12346531 <a title="603-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-01-Sun%27s_High-Performance_and_Reliable_Web_Proxy_Solution.html">456 high scalability-2008-12-01-Sun's High-Performance and Reliable Web Proxy Solution</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As individuals and businesses depend on the Web more than ever to conduct
business, rapid and reliable content retrieval is critical. Reducing wait time
improves productivity and increases user satisfaction. Web proxy technology
has emerged as an effective solution to improve performance, help ensure
content availability and enhance network security by caching and filtering Web
content. The combination of Sun SPARC Enterprise servers with CoolThreads
technology and the Sun Java System Web Proxy Server software provides a
compelling foundation for a robust Web proxy solution. Sun SPARC Enterprise
T1000 and T2000 servers include the UltraSPARC T1 processor with CoolThreads
technology, offering six or eight cores with four threads per core. The Sun
Java System Web Proxy Server software is highly threaded and takes advantage
of the large number of threads supported by Sun UltraSPARC T1 processors with
CoolThreads technology. Together, these products provide a highly scalable

<p>Introduction: An Analysis of Linux Scalability to Many Cores, by a number of MIT
researchers, is a refreshingly practical paper on what it takes to scale Linux
and common applications like Exim, memcached, Apache, PostgreSQL, gmake,
Psearchy, and MapReduce to run on 48 core systems. A very timely paper given
moderately massive multicore systems are reportedly the near future of
computing.This paper must have taken a lot of work. They both tracked down
bottlenecks in a number of applications and the Linux kernel and they also
tried to fix them. Modestly speaking the authors said they made "modest"
changes to the kernel and applications, but there's nothing modest about what
they did. It's excellent work.After the next bit, which is the abstract, there
is a list of the problems they found and how they fixed them.The abstract:This
paper analyzes the scalability of seven system applications (Exim, memcached,
Apache, PostgreSQL, gmake, Psearchy, and MapReduce) running on Linux on a

<p>Introduction: Now that we have theC10K concurrent connection problemlicked, how do we level
up and support 10 million concurrent connections? Impossible you say. Nope,
systems right now are delivering 10 million concurrent connections using
techniques that are as radical as they may be unfamiliar.To learn how it's
done we turn toRobert Graham, CEO of Errata Security, and his absolutely
fantastic talk atShmoocon 2013calledC10M Defending The Internet At
Scale.Robert has a brilliant way of framing the problem that I've never heard
of before. He starts with a little bit of history, relating how Unix wasn't
originally designed to be a general server OS, it was designed to be a control
system for a telephone network. It was the telephone network that actually
transported the data so there was a clean separation between the control plane
and the data plane. Theproblem is we now use Unix servers as part of the data
plane, which we shouldn't do at all. If we were designing a kernel for
handling one applicati</p><p>4 0.68362379 <a title="603-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-19-Paper%3A_MegaPipe%3A_A_New_Programming_Interface_for_Scalable_Network_I-O.html">1478 high scalability-2013-06-19-Paper: MegaPipe: A New Programming Interface for Scalable Network I-O</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The paper MegaPipe: A New Programming Interface for Scalable Network I/O
(video,slides) hits the common theme that if you want to go faster you need a
better car design, not just a better driver. So that's why the authors started
with a clean-slate and designed a network API from the ground up with support
for concurrent I/O, a requirement for achieving high performance while scaling
to large numbers of connections per thread, multiple cores, etc.  What they
created is MegaPipe, "a new network programming API for message-oriented
workloads to avoid the performance issues of BSD Socket API."The result:
MegaPipe outperforms baseline Linux between 29% (for long connections) and
582% (for short connections). MegaPipe improves the performance of a modiﬁed
version of memcached between 15% and 320%. For a workload based on real-world
HTTP traces, MegaPipe boosts the throughput of nginx by 75%.What's this most
excellent and interesting paper about?Message-oriented network workloads,

<p>Introduction: Michael Nygard talks aboutTwo Ways To Boost Your Flagging Web Site. The idea
behind cache farms is to move memory devoted to the various caching layers
into one large farm of caches, as with memcached. The idea behind read pools
is to allocate your database read requests to a pool of dedicated read
servers, thus offloading the write server. Using a combination of the
strategies you aren't forced to scale up the database tier to scale your
website.</p><p>6 0.63446391 <a title="603-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-09-10-Russ%E2%80%99_10_Ingredient_Recipe_for_Making_1_Million_TPS_on_%245K_Hardware.html">1319 high scalability-2012-09-10-Russ’ 10 Ingredient Recipe for Making 1 Million TPS on $5K Hardware</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A software-based distributed caching system such as memcached is an important
piece of today's largest Internet sites that support millions of concurrent
users and deliver user-friendly response times. The distributed nature of
memcached design transforms 1000s of servers into one large caching pool with
gigabytes of memory per node. This blog entry explores single-instance
memcached scalability for a few usage patterns.Table below shows out-of-the-
box (no custom OS rewrites or networking tuning required) performance with 10G
networking hardware and one single-socket UltraSPARC T2-based server with 8
cores and 8 threads per core (64 threads on a chip)...Object Size / Ops/Sec /

<p>Introduction: The most important aspect of a scalable web architecture is data partitioning.
Most components in a modern data center are completely stateless, meaning they
just do batches of work that is handed to them, but don't store any data long-
term. This is true of most web application servers, caches like memcached, and
all of the network infrastructure that connects them. Data storage is becoming
a specialized function, delegated most often to relational databases. This
makes sense, because stateless servers are easiest to scale - you just keep
adding more. Since they don't store anything, failures are easy to handle too
- just take it out of rotation.Stateful servers require more careful
attention. If you are storing all of your data in a relational database, and
the load on that database exceeds its capacity, there is no automatic solution
that allows you to simply add more hardware and scale up. (One day, there will
be, but that's for another post). In the meantime, most websites are bui</p><p>3 0.90486848 <a title="603-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-01-Product%3A_MogileFS.html">53 high scalability-2007-08-01-Product: MogileFS</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Mind the Gap: Reconnecting Architecture and OS Research is a paper presented
atHotOS XIII, the place where researchers talk about making potential futures
happen. For a great overview of the conference take a look at this article by
Matt Welsh: Conference report: HotOS 2011 in Napa.In the VM/cloud age I
question the need of having an OS at all, programs can compile directly
against "raw" hardware, but the paper does a good job of trying to figure out
the new roll operating systems can play in the future. We've been in a long OS
holding pattern, so long that we've seen the rise of PaaS vendors skipping the
OS level abstraction completely, but there's room for a middle ground between
legacy time sharing systems of the past and service level APIs that are but
one possible future.Introduction:For too long, operating systems researchers
and developers have pretty much taken whatever computer architects have dished
out. With occasional exceptions (e.g., virtualization support), architecture</p><p>5 0.89000827 <a title="603-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-27-Product%3A_Sequoia_Database_Clustering_Technology.html">102 high scalability-2007-09-27-Product: Sequoia Database Clustering Technology</a></p>
